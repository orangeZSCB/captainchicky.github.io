            Here is a useful list of sci-fi weapons and tools that I'm trying to generalize, each with a plausible physics explanation. If not possible, 
            then will be left at the bottom list lol. Some "weapons" are actually really hard to attempt to explain via current physics so welp. Will 
            continue to add more as I find or remember more.

            <br><br>
            <i><font style="color: rgb(255, 209, 152);">Lasers</font></i> - a concentrated beam of photons at different energy levels, ranging from radio to gamma. 
            Damages targets through the delivery of vast amounts of energy via photons. Note that adding energy will increase wavelength, so to get a beam of radio waves,
            more photons instead of energy should be added. 
            <br><br>
            There are mutliple differnet designs of lasers, and the strongest ones use a series of amplifies and transfer optics to enhance a beam of photons. 
            For instance, look at the diagram below. The first amplifier increases beam density, and the second amplifier increases bean energy. 
            By modulating power between the two amplifies, a diverse array of laser beams can be produced. The optic filter at the end can sift out photons
            with incorrect energy, and then directs the beam to the transport optics. Afterwards, the beam will be directed through a series of lenses to direct all of the
            photons towards a single focal point.

            <i><font style="color: rgb(255, 209, 152);">Ion propulsion</font></i> - the propulsion of highly energetic particles, usually in a beam.
            Usually the propulsed particle is an atom in which propulsion is acheived through magnetic fields or something similar. Since charged particles rapidly
            diverge due to the occurance of similar electric charges, right before exit, adding additional electrons to the propulsed particle or of the like would 
            create a better beam, since neutral particles will not diverge as fast as charged ones. Damages target through the delivery of excessive energy.
            <br><br>
            There are a few designs, and a prominant one is a modified ion engine. By funnelling charged particles into a concentrated beam, instead of letting them
            diverge quickly, an ion beam could be made. 
        </p>

        </center>
        <p>
            However, there is a problem. This beam is weak. <b>Super</b> weak. The built in efficienty of the engine results in the force it produces to be quivalent to 
            pushing a peice of paper half a meter or so, and by no means is the concentrated beam going to do any better. Instead, we can attempt to disregard efficiency,
            and instead just heat up the input until some portion of it is plasma and beam it out. If the beam is strong and concentrated, it can be used as some sort of
            damaging ray, as shown below.

            A shallower and less strong beam that doesn't travel far enough to be used as a ray type weapon can be used as a torch or lightsaber.

            <i><font style="color: rgb(255, 209, 152);">Chemical reactions</font></i> - an uncontrolled or controlled release of energy created via chemical reactions, 
            usually employing a fuel and an oxidizer, though not always.
            <br><br>
            It can be used to create concentrated beam of energetic particles with the energy, which can be employed like an ion propulsion weapon or an engine. As an
            engine, it can be used to power missiles, and the structure of such is shown below.

            Furthermore, they can be used as a warhead on a missile. The warhead consists of a detonator which helps set off the explosion, and explosive fuel which will 
            carry out the detonation once the reaction starts from the detonator trigger. The detonator creates a trigger, such as a pulse of energy or a spark that can induce
            the explsive inside the detonator itself go go odd, which sets off the main charge. There are many different kinds of explosive fuel, and high explosives, such as 
            organic peroxides, plastic explosives or nitroglycerin are the most efficient. This is because they generate a detonation without a needed confinement compared 
            to low explosives such as gunpowder, and some, such as organic peroxides have their own oxygen fuel with them, meaning an oxidizer isn't needed.

            A more enhanced type of chemical explosive weapon called volumetric weapons requires an oxygen atmosphere to employ, which makes it impractical in 
            interstellar space or on celestial bodies without an oxygen atmosphere. However, in celestial bodies with oxygen, the produce a super powerful detonation.
            Inside a volumetric weapon, there is a primary detonator, which will explode and propel the fuel as a fine mist and secondary detonators into the air.
            Afterwards, the fuel diffused out as a mist and in contact with oxygen, will rapidly detonate, creating an extremely massive series of shockwave and a strong
            updraft due to the partial vacuum resulting from the consuption of oxygen. If the fuel doesn't go off due to the primary explosive, the secondary explosives 
            that were propelled by the initial blast will detonate as well, making sure the fuel in the oxygen rich air will go off.
            <br><br>
            The ability for the fuel to disperse and the resulting oxygen depleted air means it can easily mutilate, incapacitate, and kill biological targets within crevices.

            <i><font style="color: rgb(255, 209, 152);">EMPs</font></i> - a pulse of electromagnetic radiation, created by objects that can generate large amounts of 
            electromagnetic energy, usually in a beam or shockwave used to short-wire electronics. In a nutshell, an EMP is the sudden transfer of a large amount of charge 
            from one place to another.
            <br><br>
            A mechanism that can be used to create an EMP is such as follows. A metal cylinder denoated as an armature, is surrounded by a coil of wire. 
            The armature cylinder is filled with a high explosive, and a sturdy jacket surrounds the entire device. The stator winding and the armature 
            cylinder are separated by empty space. There is a power source, such as a bank of capacitors, which would be be connected to the stator.
            During deployment, a switch connects the capacitors to the stator, sending an electrical current through the wires. This generates an intense magnetic field.
            Then, a fuse mechanism ignites the explosive material. The explosion travels as a wave through the middle of the armature cylinder.
            As the explosion makes its way through the cylinder, the cylinder comes in contact with the stator winding. This creates a short circuit, 
            cutting the stator off from its power supply. The moving short circuit compresses the magnetic field, generating the intense electromagnetic burst.

        <p>
            Such a method generates low frequency electrical waves, which may have some limitations. 
            <br><br>
            A second method involves accelerating a high current electron beam against a mesh anode. 
            Many electrons will pass through the anode, forming a bubble of space charge behind the anode. Under the proper conditions, 
            this space charge region will oscillate at microwave frequencies. If the space charge region is placed into a resonant cavity which is appropriately 
            tuned, very high peak powers may be achieved. Conventional microwave engineering techniques may then be used to extract microwave power from the resonant cavity. 
            Because the frequency of oscillation is dependent upon the electron beam parameters, such a method may be tuned or chirped in frequency, where the microwave 
            cavity will support appropriate modes.

            A third type of EMP is generated via a nuclear explosion. <!--Link this to the nuclear explosion part of this page later--> 
            When a nuclear weapon explodes, there are four major components to it's EMP. 
            <br><br>
            The first component is designated as E1, a super quick pulse on the scale of nanoseconds. It begins with the ionization 
            of surrounding air by gamma radiation via the Compton effect and creating a Compton current, so thus E1 will not exist during nuclear detonations in insterstellar space 
            on or celestial bodies that lack air. Each gamma ray contains about 2 MeV of energy and transfers half of that to the electrons which it will eject from the air 
            molecules. The electrons in a vacuum with an absent magnetic field will travel at 10s of ampres per square meter. On celestial bodies with a magnetic field, electrons 
            will be directed by said magnetic field. Take Earth for example. A nuclear detonation's E1 EMP pulse in the northern hemisphere will be directed into an "U" 
            shaped area south of ground zero. At the equator, it is more of a circular ring around ground zero, and in the southern hemisphere, it will be an upside down 
            "U" north of ground zero.
            <br><br>
            An electron will spiral aroudn magnetic field lines until it is stopped by a collision with an air molecule, and this interaction of the negatively charged 
            electrons with the magnetic field radiates a pulse of electromagnetic energy. The E1 EMP strength peaks at about 50,000 volts per metre. The ionization process 
            in the mid-stratosphere causes this region to become an electrical conductor, a process that blocks the production of further electromagnetic signals and causes 
            the field strength to saturate at about 50,000 volts per metre. The strength of the E1 pulse depends upon the number and intensity of the gamma rays and upon 
            the rapidity of the gamma ray burst.
        </p>
        <center>
            <img class="invert" style="width: 30%;" src="./index_files/emp4.svg">
        </center>
        <p>
            The second component is E2, a relatively slower pulse that lasts up to a few seconds, enerated by scattered gamma rays and inelastic gamma rays produced by neutrons 
            from the nuclear explosion, denoted as the "scattered gamma signal" and the "neutron gamma signal". E2 is similar in frequency regime to lightning, but vastly 
            more widespread, like thousands to millions of simultaneous lightning strikes, even if each strike is at lower amplitude than most naturally occurring lightning. 
            It can be thought of as a lightning induced EMP but on a large scale. Since it is cause by burts of high energy photons, it will work in interstellar space.
            <br><br>
            The third component is E3, a much longer pulse that will last up to hundreds of seconds. It is caused by the nuclear detonation's ability to temporary distort
            a magnetic field. The detonation will compress magnetic field lines, and then after a few minutes they will return to normal, inducing charge movement and thus an EMP.
            On celestial bodies without magnetic fields or in interstellar space, E3 will not occur. 
            <br><br>
            The final component of an EMP requires that the celestial body in which detonation of the nuclear explosion host an ionosphere. Thus, any celestial body that does 
            not have an atmosphere or in interstellar space, this last component of the EMP will not be induced. A nuclear weapon when detonate will release a lot of thermal 
            energy, which means that the resulting upward and outward column of hot air moves the ionosphere overhead. The moving charge of the ionosphere is causes 
            the the EMP. When detonated above the ionosphere, more charge can be moved, creating a bigger EMP.

            <i><font style="color: rgb(255, 209, 152);">Railguns</font></i> - a weapon that uses magnetic fields to accelerate objects, ranging from relatively small
            to arbitrarily large in size whom are able to interact with a magnetic field either due to compatable charge or spin, to a high speed to incapacitate or 
            destroy an entity. It is to be noted that a projectile may not be directly fired by the magnetic field, and instead the projectile is accelerated by an object 
            that is itself accelerated by the magnetic field instead.

        <p>
            The projectile can be designed to penetrate an armored target, and may carry <!--link these later--> and EMP, biological or chemical agents, and of the like.
            Or, the projectile may be an explosive, and in this case it is comparable to a missile, although lacking an engine to propel itself.
            <br><br>
            <i><font style="color: rgb(255, 209, 152);">Magnetic fields</font></i> - a magnetic field which may be extremely powerful, such as one around a trillion 
            tesla or of the like, which can be used to redirect particles capable of interacting with it. Magnetic fields in practical use are typically generated 
            by electric currents running through conductive material, called electromagnets. Electromagnetic strength can be increased through a variety of factors. 
            By the law of induction, 
        </p>
        <center><img src="./index_files/Law-of-Induction.svg"></center>
        <p>
            we can increase the amount of loops to increase strength. Furthermore, by the magnetic field equation inside a solenoid, we can increase the thickness of the 
            wrapping wire and increase the strength of the electricity running through the wire to increase magnetic field strength.
        </p>
        <center><img src="./index_files/magfield1.svg"></center>
        <p>
            And lastly, by decreasing the temperature to lower wire resistance, strength of the magnetic field can be increased. To lower the temperature, laser cooling of the 
            wire can be implemented, and the use of evaporative cooling can work to some extent as well, resulting in a wire barely above the temperature threshold of Bose-Einstein 
            condensate formation.
            <br><br>
            Due to a magnetic field able to redirect all charged particles and even neutral particles to some extend, dependent on their intrinsic spin, a 
            "force field" can be created this way.

            <i><font style="color: rgb(255, 209, 152);">Grey goo</font></i> - small machines with components are at or near the scale of a nanometer(i.e. nanomachines), 
            programmed to make more copies of itself with surrounding resources indefinitely, not dissimilar to a real-life fork bomb. An example of a fork bomb can be found
            <a href="../../../Idiot!/">here</a>.

        <center><img style="width: 35%;" src="./index_files/gg1.svg"></center>
        <p>
            It is to be noted that <font style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">the ability to create more copies of itself via resources

            <br><br>
            Another thing that must be considered is energy. <font style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">A grey goo nanomachine must be made such that there is a net 
            energy gain after converting material into more copies of itself</font>.

            <font style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">If converting material into itself results in a net loss of energy as shown on the left graph, then the nanomachine as

            consideration. Activation energy. Consider the graph below.

            To create more of itself, grey goo nanomachines have to spend energy to break bonds and reorganize atoms into intermediary molecules. 
            These intermediary molecules have high energy, and therefore are unstable as a large amount of energy is needed to stabilize them. Thus as a result, 
            they will release energy when they are remade and finally collapse into the lower energy state, which is the final product of more grey goo nanomachines.
            Notice the fact that to get to the tipping point of energy release, there must be an initial input of energy. <font style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Depending 
            on how the nanomachine is contructed, this initial input of energy may be very high</font>, which means that the conversion of matter into more grey goo nanomachines 
            by the nanomachines will be slow in an inversely proportional relationship.

        <p>
            Although neutron pasta is made out of almost all neutrons which have neutral charge, due to their particle spin, a magnetic field is still able to hold them together.
            By incorporating a super strength magnetic field, the sufficient force from electromagnetism should be enough to emulate the intense gravity of neutron stars.

            One can then transport said neutron pasta, to an area and decompress it, returning the neutron pasta to normal density, which will release a lot of energy whilst doing so.
            In sufficient quantities, the resulting explosion may be compared to a small supernovae.

            Fission can used in a controlled reaction as an engine, called a nuclear reactor. There are many designs of nuclear reactors, and arguably one of the most efficient is the 
            fast reactor class of nuclear reactors. A fast reactor directly uses the fast neutrons emitted by fission, without moderation. Unlike thermal neutron reactors, 
            fast neutron reactors can be configured to "burn", or fission, all actinides, and given enough time, therefore drastically reduce the actinides fraction in 
            spent nuclear fuel produced by the present world fleet of thermal neutron light water reactors, thus closing the nuclear fuel cycle. 
            Alternatively, if configured differently, they can also breed more actinide fuel than they consume.
            <br><br>
            One of the reactors in the fast reactor class is the gas-cooled fast reactor.
        </p>
        <center><img class="invert" style="width: 50%" src="./index_files/nuke5.svg"></center>
        <p>
            This reactor features a fast-neutron spectrum and closed fuel cycle for efficient conversion of fertile uranium and management of actinides. 
            The reactor is helium-cooled and with an outlet temperature of 850Â° C. Such a reactor will use the direct Brayton cycle gas turbine for high thermal efficiency. 
            Fuel forms that can operate at very high temperatures and ensure an excellent retention of fission products would be the optimal fuel type, which may include
            composite ceramic fuel, advanced fuel particles, or ceramic clad elements of actinide compounds. 
            <br><br>
            Nuclear reactions can also be used in the form of an explosion or detonation as a missile or a warhead on a missile. There are 5 types of nuclear weapons, which we will discuss.
            <br><br>
            Pure fission weapons use a mass of fissile material and force it into supercriticality, which allows for exponential growth of a nuclear chain reaction.
            This can be acheived in two ways. The first is shooting one piece of sub-critical material into another, which induces supercriticality and thus explonential energy release. 
            This is called a "gun-type" fission assembly. Due to its relatively slow method of assembling sub-critical masses, plutonium cannot be used unless it is purely the 239 
            isotope, making it impractical in some cases. Furthermore, the required amount of uranium is relatively large, and thus the overall efficiency is relatively low, with 
            estimates randing around only 2% efficiency.
        </p>
        <center><img class="invert" style="width: 30%" src="./index_files/nuke6.svg"></center>
        <p>
            The second method involves compression of a sub-critical sphere or cylinder of fissile material using chemically-fueled explosive lenses, inducing supercriticality.
            The principle is simple enough and can acheive up to 20% efficiency. One of its concerns was that an implosion shock wave might be of such short duration that only part 
            of the pit is compressed at any instant as the wave passes through it. To prevent this, a pusher shell may be needed. The pusher is located between the explosive lens 
            and the tamper. It works by reflecting some of the shock wave backwards, thereby having the effect of lengthening its duration. It is made out of a low density metal, 
            such as aluminium, beryllium, or an alloy of the two metals; aluminium is easier and safer to shape while beryllium has high-neutron-reflective capability. 
            The greater efficiency is due to the inward momentum of the massive U-238 tamper. 
            The natural uranium tamper did not undergo fission from thermal neutrons, but did contribute perhaps 20% of the total yield from fission by fast neutrons. 
            Once the chain reaction started in the plutonium, the momentum of the implosion had to be reversed before expansion could stop the fission. 
            By holding everything together for a few hundred nanoseconds more, the efficiency was increased.

        <p>
            It is worth to mention that there are also numerous different designs of pure fission weapons, but I can safely say that they are all variants of the implosion type 
            I talked about above. Overall, all pure fission based bomb mechanisms can be generalized by the following diagram:
        </p>
        <center><img class="invert" style="width: 30%" src="./index_files/nuke1.svg"></center>
        <p>
            A third method involves utilizing fusion as well. By either boosting fission with fusion, or by inducing fusion with fission, greater yields can be acheieved.
            When boosting fission, this is called a boosted fission weapon. We can speed up the fissioning of the pit to reduce the minimum inertial confinement time. 
            This would allow the efficient fission of the fuel with less mass in the form of tamper or the fuel itself. The key to achieving faster fission would be to 
            introduce more neutrons, and among the many ways to do this, adding a fusion reaction was relatively easy in the case of a hollow pit.
            <br><br>
            The easiest fusion reaction to achieve is found in a 1:1 mixture of tritium and deuterium. For fusion power experiments this mixture must be held at high 
            temperatures for relatively lengthy times in order to have an efficient reaction. For explosive use, however, the goal is not to produce efficient fusion, 
            but simply provide extra neutrons early in the process. Since a nuclear explosion is supercritical, any extra neutrons will be multiplied by the chain reaction, 
            so even tiny quantities introduced early can have a large effect on the final outcome. For this reason, even the relatively low compression pressures and times, 
            in fusion terms, found in the center of a hollow pit warhead are enough to create the desired effect.
            <br><br>
            In this design, the fusion fuel in gas form is pumped into the pit during arming. This will fuse into helium and release free neutrons soon after fission begins.
            The neutrons will start a large number of new chain reactions while the pit is still critical or nearly critical. Once the hollow pit is perfected, there is little 
            reason not to boost; deuterium and tritium are easily produced in the small quantities needed, and the technical aspects are trivial.
            <br><br>
            Since the compressed pit does not need to be held together as long, the massive U-238 tamper can be replaced by a light-weight beryllium shell to reflect escaping 
            neutrons back into the pit. The mass of the pit can be reduced by half, without reducing yield. Since the mass of the metal being imploded(i.e. tamper plus pit) is 
            reduced, a smaller charge of high explosive is needed. This all reduces effective diameter needed for the construction of such a weapon.
        </p>

        <p>
            Boosted fission weapons can be made to yield hundreds of kilotons, but at great expense in fissile material and tritium. Instead, a more efficient way to 
            increase nuclear weapon yield beyond ten or so kilotons is to add a second independent stage, called a secondary. The secondary would be a canister of deuterium 
            in liquefied or hydride form. The fusion reaction would be a deterium to deterium fusion reaction, which is although harder to achieve than deuterium to tritium
            reaction, is more affordable. A fission bomb at one end would shock-compress and heat the near end, and fusion would propagate through the canister to the far end. 
            The entire fusion fuel canister would need to be enveloped by fission energy, to both compress and heat it, as with the booster charge in a boosted primary. 
            <br><br>
            Such a bomb employs a few concepts that boosted fission and pure fission weapons do not, which are the following:
            <br><br>
            The optimal way to store deuterium in a reasonably dense state is to chemically bond it with lithium, as lithium deuteride. But the lithium-6 isotope is 
            also the raw material for tritium production, and an exploding bomb is a nuclear reactor. Radiation implosion will hold everything together long enough to permit 
            the complete conversion of lithium-6 into tritium, while the bomb explodes. So the bonding agent for deuterium permits use of the deuterium to tritium fusion reaction without 
            any pre-manufactured tritium being stored in the secondary. The tritium production constraint disappears.
            <br><br>
            For the secondary to be imploded by the hot, radiation-induced plasma surrounding it, it must remain cool for the first microsecond, i.e., it must be encased 
            in a massive radiation heat shield. The shield's massiveness allows it to double as a tamper, adding momentum and duration to the implosion. 
            No material is better suited for both of these jobs than ordinary, cheap uranium-238, which also happens to undergo fission when struck by the neutrons 
            produced by deuterium to tritium fusion. This casing, called the pusher, thus has three jobs: to keep the secondary cool; to hold it, inertially, 
            in a highly compressed state; and, finally, to serve as the chief energy source for the entire bomb. The consumable pusher makes the bomb more a uranium fission bomb 
            than a hydrogen fusion bomb. Insiders never used the term "hydrogen bomb".
            <br><br>
            Finally, the heat for fusion ignition comes not from the primary but from a second fission bomb called the spark plug, embedded in the heart of the secondary. 
            The implosion of the secondary implodes this spark plug, detonating it and igniting fusion in the material around it, but the spark plug then continues to 
            fission in the neutron-rich environment until it is fully consumed, adding significantly to the yield.

            The fourth method could be denoted as a "dirty" bomb of some sorts. It seeks to emit a high amount of radiation which will cause the destruction of biological entities, 
            so using this type of weapon against mechanical entities is impractical and will have no effect. It isn't to say that the previously mentioned pure fission, fission 
            assisted fusion, and fusion assisted fission bombs do not release enough radiation. However, their design is complex, and will release tremendous amounts of kinetic energy 
            in the form of an enormous explosion as well. If one seeks to make just a radiation bomb, this method will suffice.
            <br><br>
            One of the simplest designs for such a weapon is the use of conventional explosives to scatter a radioactive material. Through conventional explosives or compressed gas, 
            radioactive elements that significantly increase background radiation resulting in cancer in DNA based biological eneities such as cadmium-113, polonium-210, strontium-90, 
            any isotope of uranium, neptunium, plutonium, and in general any radioactive material that is either exceedinly radioactive or has a large half life will suffice.
        </p>
        <center><img class="invert" style="width: 20%" src="./index_files/dirty1.png"></center>
        <p>
            The half lifes of radioactive materials are majoy factors in producing a successful dirty bomb as well. A specific design of dirty bombs, a cobalt bomb,
            could be made by placing a quantity of ordinary cobalt-59 around a thermonuclear bomb. When the bomb explodes, the neutrons produced by the fusion reaction 
            in the secondary stage of the thermonuclear bomb's explosion would transmute the cobalt to the radioactive cobalt-60, which would be vaporized by the explosion. 
            The cobalt would then condense and fall back to Earth with the dust and debris from the explosion, contaminating the ground.
            The deposited cobalt-60 would have a half-life of 5.27 years, decaying into nickel-60 and emitting and electron and two gamma rays with energies of 1.17 and 1.33 MeV.
            <br><br>
            This design involves a shockwave and tremendouns explosion from a nuclear weapon, but has the intent to spread a long lived radioactive material around so counts as well.
        </p>
        <center><img class="invert" style="width: 20%" src="./index_files/cobalt1.png"></center>
        <p>
            The second design of a dirty bomb is the neutron bomb. In a standard thermonuclear design, a small fission bomb is placed close to a larger mass of thermonuclear fuel. 
            The two components are then placed within a thick radiation case, usually made from uranium, lead or steel. The case traps the energy from the fission bomb for a brief 
            period, allowing it to heat and compress the main thermonuclear fuel. The case is normally made of depleted uranium or natural uranium metal, because the thermonuclear 
            reactions give off massive numbers of high-energy neutrons that can cause fission reactions in the casing material. These can add considerable energy to the reaction; 
            in a typical design as much as 50% of the total energy comes from fission events in the casing. For this reason, these weapons are technically known as 
            fission-fusion-fission designs.
            <br><br>
            In a neutron bomb, the casing material is selected either to be transparent to neutrons or to actively enhance their production. The burst of neutrons created in 
            the thermonuclear reaction is then free to escape the bomb, outpacing the physical explosion. By designing the thermonuclear stage of the weapon carefully, 
            the neutron burst can be maximized while minimizing the blast itself. This makes the lethal radius of the neutron burst greater than that of the explosion itself. 
            Since the neutrons disappear from the environment rapidly, such a burst over a stretch of space will kill biological entities and leave the area able to be quickly reoccupied.
            <br><br>
            Compared to a pure fission bomb with an identical explosive yield, a neutron bomb would emit about 10 times the amount of neutron radiation. In a fission bomb, 
            at sea level, the total radiation pulse energy which is composed of both gamma rays and neutrons is approximately 5% of the entire energy released; in neutron bombs 
            it would be closer to 40%, with the percentage increase coming from the higher production of neutrons. Furthermore, the neutrons emitted by a neutron bomb have a much 
            higher average energy level, close to 14 MeV, than those released during a fission reaction which is around 1â€“2 MeV.
            <br><br>
            Technically speaking, every low yield nuclear weapon is a radiation weapon, including non-enhanced variants. All nuclear weapons up to about 10 kilotons in yield 
            have prompt neutron radiation as their furthest-reaching lethal component. For standard weapons above about 10 kilotons of yield, the lethal blast and thermal 
            effects radius begins to exceed the lethal ionizing radiation radius. Enhanced radiation weapons also fall into this same yield range and simply enhance 
            the intensity and range of the neutron dose for a given yield. However, a neutron bomb seeks to maximize radiation which makes it different from traditional variants.

        <p>
            The fifth method involves only fusion. There would be no fission needed to ignite the fusion of deuterium and tritium. than existing weapons. The pure fusion weapon 
            would also have greatly increased potential yield over pure fission and fission fusion hybrid weapons. Pure fusion weapons can generate 
            arbitrarily small nuclear yields because no critical mass of fissile fuel need be assembled for detonation, as with a conventional fission primary needed to spark 
            a fusion explosion. There is also the advantage of reduced collateral damage stemming from fallout because these weapons would not create the highly radioactive 
            byproducts associated with fission-type weapons. These weapons would be lethal not only because of their explosive force, which could be large compared to bombs 
            based on chemical explosives, but also because of the neutrons they generate.
            <br><br>
            There is a barrier needed to overcome to create such a weapon, which is the ability to induce fusion without the use of fission. Prominant designs show that 
            electromagnetism can be used to induce such. One mechanism is to create a current pulse of about 2 megamperes to pass through an electrode, generating a 
            magnetic field throughout the deuterium filled chamber. A stronger current pulse at around 7 megamperes is then sent through the electrode, causing electrical 
            breakdown of the gas in Section I and the nozzle region. The plasma is propelled by the Lorentz force into Section II, olliding with the gas there and creating 
            ionizing shockwaves that convert it to a plasma. Then, strong magnetic fields can implode the plasma by a liner that would surround Section II, 
            igniting an exponentially increasing fusion reaction and creating the bomb.
        </p>
        <center><img class="invert" style="width: 30%" src="./index_files/fus1.png"></center>
        <p>
            Another way is to send a strong pulse of electrical current down the walls of a hollow conducting cylinder, creating a large magnetic field outside its surface, while
            the magnetic field inside the cylinder remains zero. The unbalanced pressure of the magnetic field outside the walls of the liner then generates a radial force inward, 
            which compressed a deterium filled center until an runaway fusion reaction is created.

            when the bubble's walls reach it, and inside the true vacuum, physics may be completely different than usual. The expanding bubble of true 
            vacuum has positive surface tension, since energy is expended as the fields roll over the potential barrier to the true vacuum. The former ir proportional to the 
            cube of the bubble's radius while the latter is proportional to the square of its radius, so there is a critical size in which the bubble can grow; as a result
            bubbles below the critical size will shrink, vice versa. This means bubbles with a radius below critical size could be used for wiping out smaller areas of
            spacetime without endangering the universe itself. Small bubbles of true vacuum can also be inflated to the critical size by providing energy and expand
            towards infinity with its speed approaching the speed of light extremely quickly <font style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">if there is a large difference in energy 
            between the false and true vacuums</font>. The bubble itself also does not produce any gravitational effects because the negative energy density of the bubble 
            interior is cancelled out by the positive kinetic energy of the wall.

            released in energetic outbursts akin to the infinitely-blueshifted radiation hypothesized to occur at the inner event horizon of a Kerr black hole; 
            forward-facing particles would thereby be energetic enough to destroy anything at the destination directly in front of the ship, so it can also be used as a weapon.
