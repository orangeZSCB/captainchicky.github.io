        <p>
            Here is a useful list of sci-fi weapons and tools that I'm trying to generalize, each with a plausible physics explanation. If not possible, 
            then will be left at the bottom list lol. Some "weapons" are actually really hard to attempt to explain via current physics so welp. Will 
            continue to add more as I find or remember more.

            <i><font style="color: rgb(255, 209, 152);">Lasers</font></i> - a concentrated beam of photons at different energy levels, ranging from radio to gamma. 
            Damages targets through the delivery of vast amounts of energy via photons. Note that adding energy will increase wavelength, so to get a beam of radio waves,
            more photons instead of energy should be added. 
            <br><br>
            There are mutliple differnet designs of lasers, and the strongest ones use a series of amplifies and transfer optics to enhance a beam of photons. 
            For instance, look at the diagram below. The first amplifier increases beam density, and the second amplifier increases bean energy. 
            By modulating power between the two amplifies, a diverse array of laser beams can be produced. The optic filter at the end can sift out photons
            with incorrect energy, and then directs the beam to the transport optics. Afterwards, the beam will be directed through a series of lenses to direct all of the
            photons towards a single focal point.

            <i><font style="color: rgb(255, 209, 152);">Ion propulsion</font></i> - the propulsion of highly energetic particles, usually in a beam.
            Usually the propulsed particle is an atom in which propulsion is acheived through magnetic fields or something similar. Since charged particles rapidly
            diverge due to the occurance of similar electric charges, right before exit, adding additional electrons to the propulsed particle or of the like would 
            create a better beam, since neutral particles will not diverge as fast as charged ones. Damages target through the delivery of excessive energy.
            <br><br>
            There are a few designs, and a prominant one is a modified ion engine. By funnelling charged particles into a concentrated beam, instead of letting them
            diverge quickly, an ion beam could be made.

        <p>
            However, there is a problem. This beam is weak. <b>Super</b> weak. The built in efficienty of the engine results in the force it produces to be quivalent to 
            pushing a peice of paper half a meter or so, and by no means is the concentrated beam going to do any better. Instead, we can attempt to disregard efficiency,
            and instead just heat up the input until some portion of it is plasma and beam it out. If the beam is strong and concentrated, it can be used as some sort of
            damaging ray, as shown below.

            A shallower and less strong beam that doesn't travel far enough to be used as a ray type weapon can be used as a torch or lightsaber.

            <i><font style="color: rgb(255, 209, 152);">Chemical reactions</font></i> - an uncontrolled or controlled release of energy created via chemical reactions, 
            usually employing a fuel and an oxidizer, though not always.
            <br><br>
            It can be used to create concentrated beam of energetic particles with the energy, which can be employed like an ion propulsion weapon or an engine. As an
            engine, it can be used to power missiles, and the structure of such is shown below.

            Furthermore, they can be used as a warhead on a missile. The warhead consists of a detonator which helps set off the explosion, and explosive fuel which will 
            carry out the detonation once the reaction starts from the detonator trigger. The detonator creates a trigger, such as a pulse of energy or a spark that can induce
            the explsive inside the detonator itself go go odd, which sets off the main charge. There are many different kinds of explosive fuel, and high explosives, such as 
            organic peroxides, plastic explosives or nitroglycerin are the most efficient. This is because they generate a detonation without a needed confinement compared 
            to low explosives such as gunpowder, and some, such as organic peroxides have their own oxygen fuel with them, meaning an oxidizer isn't needed.

            A more enhanced type of chemical explosive weapon called volumetric weapons requires an oxygen atmosphere to employ, which makes it impractical in 
            interstellar space or on celestial bodies without an oxygen atmosphere. However, in celestial bodies with oxygen, the produce a super powerful detonation.
            Inside a volumetric weapon, there is a primary detonator, which will explode and propel the fuel as a fine mist and secondary detonators into the air.
            Afterwards, the fuel diffused out as a mist and in contact with oxygen, will rapidly detonate, creating an extremely massive series of shockwave and a strong
            updraft due to the partial vacuum resulting from the consuption of oxygen. If the fuel doesn't go off due to the primary explosive, the secondary explosives 
            that were propelled by the initial blast will detonate as well, making sure the fuel in the oxygen rich air will go off.
            <br><br>
            The ability for the fuel to disperse and the resulting oxygen depleted air means it can easily mutilate, incapacitate, and kill biological targets within crevices.

            <i><font style="color: rgb(255, 209, 152);">EMPs</font></i> - a pulse of electromagnetic radiation, created by objects that can generate large amounts of 
            electromagnetic energy, usually in a beam or shockwave used to short-wire electronics. In a nutshell, an EMP is the sudden transfer of a large amount of charge 
            from one place to another.
            <br><br>
            A mechanism that can be used to create an EMP is such as follows. A metal cylinder denoated as an armature, is surrounded by a coil of wire. 
            The armature cylinder is filled with a high explosive, and a sturdy jacket surrounds the entire device. The stator winding and the armature 
            cylinder are separated by empty space. There is a power source, such as a bank of capacitors, which would be be connected to the stator.
            During deployment, a switch connects the capacitors to the stator, sending an electrical current through the wires. This generates an intense magnetic field.
            Then, a fuse mechanism ignites the explosive material. The explosion travels as a wave through the middle of the armature cylinder.
            As the explosion makes its way through the cylinder, the cylinder comes in contact with the stator winding. This creates a short circuit, 
            cutting the stator off from its power supply. The moving short circuit compresses the magnetic field, generating the intense electromagnetic burst.
        </p>

        <p>
            Such a method generates low frequency electrical waves, which may have some limitations. 
            <br><br>
            A second method involves accelerating a high current electron beam against a mesh anode. 
            Many electrons will pass through the anode, forming a bubble of space charge behind the anode. Under the proper conditions, 
            this space charge region will oscillate at microwave frequencies. If the space charge region is placed into a resonant cavity which is appropriately 
            tuned, very high peak powers may be achieved. Conventional microwave engineering techniques may then be used to extract microwave power from the resonant cavity. 
            Because the frequency of oscillation is dependent upon the electron beam parameters, such a method may be tuned or chirped in frequency, where the microwave 
            cavity will support appropriate modes.

            A third type of EMP is generated via a nuclear explosion. <!--Link this to the nuclear explosion part later--> This however requires that the celestial body 
            in which detonation of the nuclear explosion host an ionosphere. Thus, any celestial body that does not have an atmosphere or in interstellar space, such 
            a method will not generate an EMP.
            <br><br>
            A nuclear weapon when detonate will release a lot of thermal energy, which means that the resulting upward and outward column of hot air moves the ionosphere overhead. 
            The moving charge of the ionosphere is what causes the bulk of the EMP. A nuclear detonation may also ionize the surrounding air and then move that charge, 
            which may contribute to the EMP as well. When detonated above the ionosphere, more charge can be moved, creating a bigger EMP.

            <i><font style="color: rgb(255, 209, 152);">Railguns</font></i> - a weapon that uses magnetic fields to accelerate objects, ranging from relatively small
            to arbitrarily large in size whom are able to interact with a magnetic field either due to compatable charge or spin, to a high speed to incapacitate or 
            destroy an entity. It is to be noted that a projectile may not be directly fired by the magnetic field, and instead the projectile is accelerated by an object 
            that is itself accelerated by the magnetic field instead.

            The projectile can be designed to penetrate an armored target, and may carry <!--link these later--> and EMP, biological or chemical agents, and of the like.
            Or, the projectile may be an explosive, and in this case it is comparable to a missile, although lacking an engine to propel itself.
            <br><br>
            <i><font style="color: rgb(255, 209, 152);">Magnetic fields</font></i> - a magnetic field which may be extremely powerful, such as one around a trillion 
            tesla or of the like, which can be used to redirect particles capable of interacting with it. Magnetic fields in practical use are typically generated 
            by electric currents running through conductive material, called electromagnets. Electromagnetic strength can be increased through a variety of factors. 
            By the law of induction, 
        </p>
        <center><img src="./index_files/Law-of-Induction.svg"></center>
        <p>
            we can increase the amount of loops to increase strength. Furthermore, by the magnetic field equation inside a solenoid, we can increase the thickness of the 
            wrapping wire and increase the strength of the electricity running through the wire to increase magnetic field strength.
        </p>
        <center><img src="./index_files/magfield1.svg"></center>
        <p>
            And lastly, by decreasing the temperature to lower wire resistance, strength of the magnetic field can be increased. To lower the temperature, laser cooling of the 
            wire can be implemented, and the use of evaporative cooling can work to some extent as well, resulting in a wire barely above the temperature threshold of Bose-Einstein 
            condensate formation.
            <br><br>
            Due to a magnetic field able to redirect all charged particles and even neutral particles to some extend, dependent on their intrinsic spin, a 
            "force field" can be created this way.

            <i><font style="color: rgb(255, 209, 152);">Grey goo</font></i> - small machines with components are at or near the scale of a nanometer(i.e. nanomachines), 
            programmed to make more copies of itself with surrounding resources indefinitely, not dissimilar to a real-life fork bomb. An example of a fork bomb can be found
            <a href="../../../Idiot!/">here</a>.

        <center><img style="width: 35%;" src="./index_files/gg1.svg"></center>
        <p>
            It is to be noted that <font style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">the ability to create more copies of itself via resources 
            around it may sometimes be unfeasible</font> due to lack of <i>correct</i> resources. It can be assumed that grey goo nanomachines would contain metals in them, 
            but metals are usualy rare compared to others such as carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, or of the like making replication hard in some environments.
            <br><br>
            Another thing that must be considered is energy. <font style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">A grey goo nanomachine must be made such that there is a net 
            energy gain after converting material into more copies of itself</font>.

            consideration. Activation energy. Consider the graph below.

            To create more of itself, grey goo nanomachines have to spend energy to break bonds and reorganize atoms into intermediary molecules. 
            These intermediary molecules have high energy, and therefore are unstable as a large amount of energy is needed to stabilize them. Thus as a result, 
            they will release energy when they are remade and finally collapse into the lower energy state, which is the final product of more grey goo nanomachines.
            Notice the fact that to get to the tipping point of energy release, there must be an initial input of energy. <font style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Depending 
            on how the nanomachine is contructed, this initial input of energy may be very high</font>, which means that the conversion of matter into more grey goo nanomachines 
            by the nanomachines will be slow in an inversely proportional relationship.

            or by compressing neutrons via magnetic fields or <font style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">graviton manipulation</font> to create neutron pasta. 
            It is to be noted that <font style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">the neutron pasta inside neutron stars is buried under a very strong crust, making it very hard to get</font>. 
            Creating neutron pasta may be the more viable option.

        <center><img style="width: 30%;" src="./index_files/np1.svg"></center>
        <p>
            Although neutron pasta is made out of almost all neutrons which have neutral charge, due to their particle spin, a magnetic field is still able to hold them together.
            By incorporating a super strength magnetic field, the sufficient force from electromagnetism should be enough to emulate the intense gravity of neutron stars.
            <br><br>
            One can then transport said neutron pasta, to an area and decompress it, returning the neutron pasta to normal density, which will release a lot of energy whilst doing so.
            In sufficient quantities, the resulting explosion may be compared to a small supernovae.

            formed. <font style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Graviton manipulation</font> could also be used to create the black hole. Since the particles creating the black hole 
            has charge, it can be propelled via magnetic fields as a form of "gun", or left at its materialization spot to cause destruction via the absorption of surrounding 
            matter. Also note that such black holes if not able to sustain themselves will evaporate via Hawking Radiation so induced black holes that evaporate too quickly to 
            be used as a matter absorption weapon can be also used as a bomb.

            through an active trigger such as a very energetic explosion/collision and induced quantum tunneling, or through a passive trigger such as a black hole, 
            the false vacuum can decay into a true vacuum, expanding in a sphere through spacetime that will destroy present configurations of matter 
            when the bubble's walls reach it, and inside the true vacuum, physics may be completely different than usual. The expanding bubble of true 
            vacuum has positive surface tension, since energy is expended as the fields roll over the potential barrier to the true vacuum. The former ir proportional to the 
            cube of the bubble's radius while the latter is proportional to the square of its radius, so there is a critical size in which the bubble can grow; as a result
            bubbles below the critical size will shrink, vice versa. This means bubbles with a radius below critical size could be used for wiping out smaller areas of
            spacetime without endangering the universe itself. Small bubbles of true vacuum can also be inflated to the critical size by providing energy and expand
            towards infinity with its speed approaching the speed of light extremely quickly <font style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">if there is a large difference in energy 
            between the false and true vacuums</font>. The bubble itself also does not produce any gravitational effects because the negative energy density of the bubble 
            interior is cancelled out by the positive kinetic energy of the wall.

            forward-facing particles would thereby be energetic enough to destroy anything at the destination directly in front of the ship, so it can also be used as a weapon.
