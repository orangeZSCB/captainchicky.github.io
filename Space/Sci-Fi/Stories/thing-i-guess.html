Prologue
~~~~~~~
The sun was shining. It was not quite dusk yet but nevertheless the cloudless sky was tainted with a golden brilliance that scattered in all directions, illuminating the great earth. It was a beautiful sight, but alas, I was not there to enjoy it. All around me, the people from the various sects surrounded me. They were here to kill me. 

“You diabolical demon! You should obediently hand over the artifact, and I will let you die comfortably!”

“Devilish bastard, don’t attempt to resist! Today, all the great righteous sects and heros have joined hands to destroy you! Inescapable nets have soon been arranged here. You definitely will be beheaded this time!”

“You damn devil, you’ve killed countless lives just to cultivate the artifact! You have committed appalling sins, the unforgivable and innumerable sins!”

“Fiend, three hundred years ago you had insulted me, snatched away my pure body, savaged my entire family, and killed nine generations of mine. From there onwards, I regretted not eating your flesh and drinking your blood! Today, I will let you face something even worse than death!”

I was wearing a dilapidated, large dark grey robe, and looking around with my feathers messy and body blood-soaked. My blood-stained robe was drifting with the mountain wind, like a battle flag which was proudly moving in the evening sunlight. Bright red blood was oozing out from numerous opened wounds on my body. Just standing still for a while, the blood under my feet would soon accumulate into a small pool. Surrounded by enemies, every possible way of escape was cut off. 

I could possibly die today. However, I was aware of such consequences a long time ago. Though, even if possible death was coming, my eyes were still expressionless, carrying a calm countenance. Many people had claimed my dark eyes were like a deep old well, which was so deep that one couldn’t see the bottom, but I thought not. My goal was always straightforward. Mainly, it was to kill. Yet, the people thought that there was something hidden, which I found amusing. I had lost all other purposes to live from that day forward, and especially after my fate escaped from my grasp after the encounter.

I looked around at the outstanding heroes from those righteous sects who were surrounding me. They were the respectable sect’s leaders, their famous young heroes and many students of famous martial artists and mages. There were people who were yelling, or coldly smiling, or squinting their eyes which were beaming with alerted light, or frighteningly looking at me while holding down tightly on their wounds. 

But they didn’t make even the slightest move. Everyone was afraid that I would counter-attack. 

Such an intense confrontation lasted for quite a long time. The sun was shining its light on the side of the mountain. The surroundings were lit up like a forest fire. Then, I, who was staying quiet like a statue, gradually turned away. The people surrounding me suddenly became alerted. They consistently strode back one step. 

Concurrently, the gray-white mountain rocks under my feet had soon turned into a scarlet red color from my blood. My pale expression was added with captivating, brilliant light when being shone upon by the sunset. 

Looking at the green mountain and sunset, I softly said with a faint smile, 

“Sunset on the mountain, 
autumn moon, and spring breeze. 
It is indeed black hair at dawn 
turns to snow at nightfall, 
right or wrong, in victory or in defeat, 
looking back, were superfluous.”

Memories of my life came rushing to my mind. I had been struggling in this world for hundreds of years. My friends and allies smiled at me but were slashed through by a dark ominous blade. Furrowing my brows, numerous memories from which I had buried deep down inside my heart suddenly lively reappeared in front of his eyes at this moment. In the end, everyone would hate me. Everyone would want to kill me. Such results though, I had already known would happen. When I made my choice to carry on, I had already prepared for this. 

I am so powerful, yet I couldn’t protect anyone. And as a matter of fact, I couldn’t protect myself. What a pathetic sight. I couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

“You demon, what are you laughing at?”

“Everyone, be careful! The demon is going to counter attack at his last moments!”

“Quickly hand over the artifact!”

As those outstanding heroes were forcingly approaching me, I just shook my head. They knew I was powerful, yet they still chose to engage. The Sword, Spear, and Explosive Blade Sect masters and their disciples approached me. In an offensive position, they circled around me. 

One of them swung their sword at me. I parried. A group of them in formation charged. With a smirk, I met them head on. In what seemed like a blur, I was making hundreds of attacks per second. After a blink of an eye, many of my enemies were laying on the ground. Some dead, but most wounded. 

The Hua Mountain Sect came to exchange blows with me next. Using what seemed to be an erratic, patternless footwork, they attacked me at random intervals. Some of them even managed to cut me. I had seen it many times during previous encounters, and to me, it was nothing but a nuisance. Smiling, I stayed put. They could not harm me if I only defended myself and not fall into their trap. In the end, it was their net loss of mana. Seeing my immobilement, they switched their tactics. 

The Tang Monastery master charged at me. With a bang, his strike was blocked by my sword. His red cape suddenly swung towards. I laughed. It was such a simple trick. Suppressed intimidation magic embedded within clothing. With a quick flame magic, I burned the cape as it quickly approached me.

As he leapt back, I charged towards him with my sword aurora. Another bang revealed that he parried. I gave him no chance of rest, swinging my sword vertically at his head, as he blocked it with his sword.

“You’re pretty good.” I remarked.

“Shut up you demon!” He shouted at me.

“Oh well then. Don’t mind me for not going easy!”

I charged at him extremely swiftly with clean swings. He tried to block, but my power overwhelmed his meager strength. With a yell, I cut him cleanly in half.

“Join in everyone! Do not be afraid! This demon is injured, and will not be able to keep up with our attacks!” Somebody shouted in the distance, as many more people swarmed around me, attempting to strike me.

They really underestimated me. With a jump, I swung my sword and met them head on. The air was filled with the sound of metal striking each other. A fireball hit my left wing. Another arrow strike was landed on my back before my internal mana disintegrated it, with a flutter of severed feathers. My numerous wounds ached with pain.

I sighed. If it continued like this, I would really lose. I injected a stream of mana into the artifact I was still carrying, and a surge of energy flowed through me. My staff glowed in my hand as I activated a shield, and a magic circle appeared on the ground around everybody surrounding me.

“Get out of the circle!” shouted several people.

Laughing, I remarked,  “It’s a bit too late.”, and a column of fire erupted out of the ground.

All around me, the earth was scorched. Dead bodies lay on the ground like ants. I looked around me. Only the most powerful had survived my attack. Some took this chance after my attack, and charged at me.

“It’s no use.” I commented. “Today, you all have to die.”

I concentrated my mana in a circle in front of me. All around me, things glowed dark red. Moments before their swords, spells, and arrows would strike me dead, I cast my move. A dark ball of scarlet flame expanded outwards in a fireball, obliterating everything around me. 

Standing atop of a neighbouring mountain was a muscular figure, wielding a ji, and he was the leader. I lifted my gaze up to his, and said, “Well, your move?”

He gritted his teeth and shouted “Activate the Seven Pillars!”.

The imperial mages uttered their spells, absorbing mana from their surroundings. Seven colored pillars of flame resembling a hellish rainbow rushed at me. They were quite magnificent, the pinnacle of martial arts of the time. It would have been a devastating blow to me a few years ago, and I would have wanted to test how well I could fare if I met it directly head on. But a sudden dull headache and a sharp ringing sound in my ears reminded me that I didn’t have the time. If I couldn’t complete this task, that being who stood in the shadows would kill me.

Gritting my teeth, I gripped the artifact again and this time injected all of my remaining mana. Power, all that I would need, exploded from the artifact. Uttering an ancient draconic tongue, a cyan speck of light appeared within the artifact, and suddenly ejected itself into the sky above me. The speck of light expanded into a blue haze, and continued to expand, until it met with the seven pillars of fire. For a while, it seemed that their power would win, but then the artifact overwhelmed them.

Where the mountain stood, a giant sinkhole now took its place. A deep rumbling sound echoed in the air, and finally died down as the sun finally began to set. The deed was done. I did all I could, and hoped for the best.

With a sigh, I closed my eyes as I sat down, waiting…

Then, a voice rang in the air.

You have done well. Now, complete the last part of our contract.

I spat. That was the being I hated. I hated him so much, as much hatred as all of the people I killed combined had hated me throughout their entire lives. But I could do nothing against him. To him, I was powerless. 

As a matter of fact he could have done everything I did up to now himself with a flick of a finger, with the exception of the last point in our contract, and yet I suppose it amused him to see me struggle. All I could do was draw a breath, as I stood up, cut through spacetime, and entered the transcended realm.

Mist was suspended in the plane. Entire worlds floated here. I floated there motionless, as I checked my wounds and tried casting healing magic to recover to the best of my ability, waiting for the voice. Hours passed. Finally, a dark shadow moved in the distance.

“You have come to kill me?” asked a dragon-like figure as it approached me.

“Yes. I have indeed.” I replied.

“Under its orders?” the voice curiously asked.

“Who else would want you dead so badly?” I remarked.

“Haha, he really tried hard eh? I suppose not being able to access the transcended plane serves quite the detriment to people like you, being used and all. He knows how to strike at weak points.” the voice said, amused.

“It does. Really does indeed.”

“Well, I understand your unfortunate circumstances. You do realize though my power is on another level compared to you?” the voice replied.

“When has that ever stopped me?” I laughed, “I’m sure you have been observing Murium for a while now. You’ve watched my fights.”

“Hahahaha very good. Then, let this be it! Let us fight! I’ve never had a strong opponent in a while.” It remarked.

“Very well. This will be interesting.” I said.

And I leaped towards the figure with my staff and sword, my aura of flames surrounding me.

This was going to be a once in a lifetime battle.

A flash was all that a bystander would see. Yet in such a flash, our battle was over. Thousands of blows, spells and strikes against each other were initiated by the time the flash faded. In the transcended realm, time was subjective. As a matter of fact, spacetime here could be easily manipulated in a local environment to slow down to a halt.

I smiled. My right wing was gone. Half of my body was rather mutilated. My power had completely ran out. But it was of nothing. It didn’t matter. The pain, it was also of no matter.

What mattered, was that our battle was over. I had lost. 

“Absolutely astonishing! You actually hurt me quite a bit! You are a truly formidable opponent.” a rather cheerful voice erupted around me.

“It is such an honor to hear that praise from you!” I replied, slightly dejected.

“And yet,” it continued, “your power still fails you when you need it the most. Even as a being reaching such a state, you cannot defy death, and our fight must come to an end.” the voice said, followed by a sigh.

I chuckled. “It’s funny isn’t it? My life. I had fought so long to preserve it, and yet in the end, it was all in vain. Fate is a cruel thing is it not?”

“Quite a shame indeed…” the voice paused, “...however, there’s a thing that I’d like to tell you.”

“What is it?” I curiously asked.

“I’ve grown quite fond of you as a matter of fact, observing you as you journeyed within Murium. So much in fact that I think it might be worth it using resurrection magic on you.”

“...What are you trying to imply? We all know at this point that resurrection magic is completely useless and an immense amount of energy is needed to activate it. And that’s just the principle of it. Resurrection magic has never been cast before, meaning we won’t know what would happen.”

“You are quite slow still eh? I am a great being of transience. Your puny theory of resurrection isn’t what I’m talking about. Thanks to a certain person, I’ve completed the spell, so there is no way it would fail, contrary to what you might expect. Are you really looking down on me? Hahahahaha.”

“Okay, assuming it succeeds, how do we know the magic will affect it as well?”

“Well, for your information, the plutonian realm unlike the transcended realm is affected by such a thing as well...” It said, “...so, what do you say?”

“...w-why are you doing this?” I asked, still quite dazed at this load of information.

“My my, getting amnesia already? As I’ve stated, I’ve taken quite the liking to you, and it would be quite a shame for your story to end here. And this time, since you’re heading back in time, get strong enough to kill it for me alright?”

“I-... Alright. I will do that… And my memories?”

“Your memories will stay intact.”

“I see… Well uh, shall we try this then?”

“Sure. Go ahead, you know the procedure. I’ll be completing the rest and supplying the mana.”

I concentrated my mana to my chest, creating a rather golden-aquamarine hue. Time warped and stretched around me.

“Hah, a warp back to childhood. It would be quite the spectacle to live life again. We’ll meet again, Kylaria.” I said.

“Then I look forward to it, Brucey. I wish your new life better than the last, of not the puppet but the puppet master.” the voice said, as it accumulated energy in its jaw to deliver the final piece of the spell.

“Thank you…” I said softly.

I saw a red beam approach and hit me, the mana I accumulated in my chest exploded in a shower of blue golden sparks, enveloping me as time reversed. I closed my eyes, and let the thoughts of a new, bright, future ahead of me fill my mind.
























~~~~~~~~
Chapter 1
~~~~~~~~
The spring rain fell from the stormy, thunderous sky. A strike of lightning crawled across the ominous dark clouds, casting a white hue to the surrounding landscape. I stood beside the window, admiring the view. I was inside a leaky house. The walls were rotting, the paint was peeling. It was not exactly the most decent place. But that was okay. I was back in my childhood. 

A familiar knock ringed throughout the room as I turned to greet it.

"Mother said you need to sleep now, or she will punish you."

I knew that voice all too well. Marsha, my dear little sister. Despite her being gone for such a long time in my previous life, I could still clearly remember the times where we talked, trained, and played together. It was truly a miracle, this resurrection magic.

"Alright, I'll go to sleep, tell mother that."

"Be quick brother! Mother will check soon and if you're not asleep, we will all be in trouble!"

The creaking sound of the door followed, then a click. I still made no move towards the bed. Instead, I peered out of the window, letting the rain splatter on me, and looked at the city in the distance. I laughed. Getting to re-live life once again, it was amazing. 

However, there was still so much to do. Going back in time means that the skills I built up over my life, had all gone to waste. Everything I had, was gone. Breathing out a sigh, I closed the window, slowly made my way to the bed, and closed my eyes.

Beams of light shot out by the morning sun greeted me as I woke. I got out of bed, and was met with a gentle breeze that opened my window. The clouds of the previous night had passed, leaving nothing but a vast, veil-like expanse of azure blue. Perhaps I was too excited to notice, or perhaps it was the rain, but now, I could even smell the faint scent of apricot blossoms, bringing a wave of nostalgia to my heart.

I came out of my room, met by the voices of my parents and my sister. I unhurriedly made my way downstairs. The sight of the kitchen and living room, downtrodden by the damp weather, was all it took to make me smile. I looked at my mother. She didn't look back, and instead continued what she was doing, while saying, 

"Go get some firewood and water."

I expected this already. My mother was always strict and cold, but I knew on the inside she loved us.

I proceeded to open the door, and stepped outside. The singing trills of songbirds echoed through the valley, as they eagerly leapt from branch to branch, pausing only to catch a breath. 

The groups of flowering trees filled the air with their petals, their fragrance. Peach, lemon, grapefruit, apple, and most notably, apricot. The respective trees littered the pastures, some far apart, and others in tight clusters, as if they were having picnics. 

Further down the fields, a large lake came to view. Small schools of minnows swam near the shore, nibbling at small bits of food, periodically surfacing with a brilliant, nimble jump.

The larger fish mostly stayed in the shadows of the deeper waters. Occasionally, one might even catch a glimpse of them, sometimes, seeing crimson red scales, or brilliant criss-crosses of black and white, while other times seeing a long fin, or a snake-like twirl.

Growing around the lake were large willow trees. Normally, they would drape their leaves against the surface of the water, towering majestically against the background of smaller trees. When there was a small zephyr, the willows would let their leaves dance gracefully in the wind, almost as if mimicking ballet dancers and their beautiful movements.

I walked towards the old mossy well next to the lake, gathering two buckets of water in the two wooden containers I've used, long ago, for years, and trodded back home along the stone path etched into the soggy ground.

Our home, our neighbors, the city we lived next to, they were all surrounded by such a magnificent environment. It would be such a shame that in just a few years, fire and war-torn ruins would have replaced the soft, green grass that carpeted the earth around us.

The days passed in a blur. Each morning, I would get up by the crow of a rooster, help with the fire, make breakfast, and then, when all the morning work was finished, I would sit down beside the shimmering lamplight, away from the blinding rays of the sun that shot down upon the fields, and study. I had visited many notable booksellers to purchase material for preparation.

First of all, many of these books, albeit overpriced, were for preparing for an academy I would eventually want to attend. Second, there were countless subjects I needed to know in depth. During my previous life, none of these were ever provided to me in my youth, and I never had the motive to obtain them myself. When I finally had the ability to grasp them, they were of no use to me anymore. 

After the sun rose to the center of the sky, I would close up my books and go to the city. There, I would head over to my father's shop and sell goods. Then, when the sun met the horizon and showered the sky with orange sparkles, I would walk back home, grab the crude wooden sword I made, and head out to the fields to train. 

Basic footwork, swings, and parries. I had a complete understanding of sword work, but my childhood body just lacked the endurance and strength I so desperately needed, so just the basics would do. As far as magic, that would be an absolute waste of time. I lacked the necessary resources to even start attempting the most basic spells and mana manipulation.

I always kept myself secluded and distanced from others. I found that having another in my company would distract me. I needed to prepare myself for the future as soon as possible, even if it meant ignoring my neighbors, or even my sister. Not only that, but having an emotional connection to anything would serve as a detriment to me in the future. If someone I valued were to be taken hostage, it would not be ideal.

Day after day, month after month, I studied and trained, all the while waiting for that moment to arrive. And in just a year and a half, that moment would finally come.

It was a day by itself, coming out of a fortnight's worth of storm and rain. The sun did not shine clearly, but it spread through the clouds, in a tender, diffused light, crossed by the level cloud bars, which stretch to vast lengths, parallel to the horizon. The tints in the sky were absolutely gorgeous, every conceivable hue of glassy blue, stormy grey, and in some spots, dazzling white, which contrived to modulate into the golden brilliance in which the sun was veiled. 

I went out in the morning following with my usual schedule, trodding along the mossy ground that had been savaged by the lavish, drenching downpour. It was too early in the year for a heavy fall of leaves, but nevertheless, the ground was covered. Perhaps it was the cold, or perhaps it was the unusually rainy weeks, such that even the trees that have not yet lost the fire in their branches seemed bare, as their leaves lay in extravagant excess, heaped beside the walls, masses of glorious harmonies of red, brown, and yellow.

Despite the sky seemingly looking like a never-ending, grey, and undulating expanse, noon was rather easy to tell. The skies seemed more cheerful as the shimmering sunlight disappeared and reappeared behind the clouds. Sighing, I closed up my book and walked outside. 

A chilly zephyr blew past me, dragging dancing leaves and pulling my feathers along with it. I ruffled up a bit, shook myself, and settled down before continuing to make my way towards the city.

The city itself was filled with people, and along with it, the sound of hundreds of voices echoing in the air, intertwining and mixing, before at last, melting into a constant ambiance of white noise.

The streets were soggy, filled with decaying leaves, trash, and moss. Despite the putrid atmosphere, it did not seem to deter many. I was walking towards my father's store, plodding through the mud, wary of the ever sprinkling sky when I noticed it, along with the people around me. It was a sudden, continuous and indecipherable shouting and galloping, sounding in the distance. The people who were leisurely strolling, chatting, or shopping scattered from the street center and I did the same.

In the distance, the red flags waved in the wind, a fierce looking dragon sewn onto them. They were people from the capital! I stayed put where I was and watched the procession gallop through the street, kicking up clouds of smoke.

"Make way! Make way!", the leading figure shouted, while behind him, several soldiers holding hoisted weapons or red flags followed.

As fast as they appeared, the processions disappeared from view, dust still in the air. I ran after them, ignoring the fact that there was dust in my eyes and mouth.

The processions stopped short of the city square, and the leading figure jumped off his horse. He was rather bulky and wearing iron-clad armor. He walked up onto the platform where the proud Railathian flag was waving. All around the city square, people gathered in a tight circle, but not one dared to step closer.

The man took out a piece of parchment and cleared his throat.

"Attention!" he exclaimed. "The Ralathian Education Board wished to evaluate new candidates for Empirium Academy. All who are interested, please arrive at the academy by next month!"

And without further ado, he rolled up the parchment and started walking off the stage.

A man seemingly in his 50's shouted from the crowd, 

"Will there be an entry fee?!"

The ringing sound of his voice barely faded away before a sudden wave of noise washed upon me as many people shouted questions of their own. However, despite the questions being asked, the leading figure ignored them, proceeded to get on his horse, before riding away.

I laughed at the crowd silently. Were they really that clueless? The soldiers who arrived here were merely doing their assigned duties, and cared not of this city and its inhabitants.

I left the crowd and walked to my father's shop. It was a modest one, nothing too fancy. On the outside, one would see a window with shiny shoes on display, and on the inside, it was moderately furnished, with racks of shoes one could choose from and buy,

My father was sitting behind the checkout counter when I saw him. I made my way next to him and spoke, 

"Father, the messengers from the capital..."

"I know, I've heard." he cut me off.

Looking my in the eye, he continued, "You must go. Start packing now okay? I don't want any excuses."

"I understand, and of course, I will go." I replied with a slight smirk.

In my past life, I was rather reluctant going to the academy, but now, not going would just be foolish.

My father seemed rather surprised by my eagerness and gave me a questioning glare, but this was quickly replaced by a smile.

"That's my boy!", he said, and ushered me out.

So instead of helping with business today, I went home and started packing. Food, water, a tent, a few books, my sword, some money, there was quite a lot, but it was all necessary.

A few days later, it was finally time to go. The city mayor had organized a caravan for those who wanted to attend the evaluation, and after I bid my family farewell, I headed towards the city to join those who would go with me on the journey to the academy.


















~~~~~~~~
Chapter 2
~~~~~~~~
I made my way to the town exit, carrying a bulky bag and holstering my wooden sword. Moving along the same path as I were a few other people who were looking timidly around. They were likely lower class, putting their hopes on getting into the nation’s famous academy and bringing their family to a better stance in society, but it was unlikely they would ever make it in.

After a few minutes of walking, I had arrived at the gates, and was met with the caravan. The caravan itself was rather impressive. There were a decent amount of carriages and a dozen or so guards on horses. Of course, the carriages were for the upper class only, and me being me, was from a poor family, so I would have to walk alongside the carriages like many others. 

It had seemed that the nobles had prepared and arrived much earlier, sitting in their carriages conversing and waiting for the trip to start. Oh well, that was of no matter. I had arrived kind of last minute anyways, and in a few minutes the caravan would take off.

The path wouldn’t be a long one. A week at most to the capital, going through a few plains and a small forest. This trip would be a troublesome one however, if my early memories served me correct. 

The first few days went by dully. The repetitive clack of horse hooves and the rolling of carriage wheels would echo through the air hours upon end before a short break. Then the caravan would resume travelling. It was nighttime now though, and as fires were being lit, people ate their dinner and rested. 

I leaned against a tree a good distance away from most, munching some bread. Around the campfires people sat on makeshift chairs made from downed tree trunks, talking. The nobles had brought a few servants with them and would eat luxurious foods, but it would run out in a few days nevertheless, which I laughed at the thought. I had looked around at most people, and they had seemed unremarkable. Not that I remember anybody important from my previous life anyways. 

Suddenly, my ears picked up a faint whistling whistling to my left. Somebody was giving a signal. We were heading into the forestested area, and from my memories, this is where the incident would occur. Giving a heaving sigh, I quietly put on my dark cloak, lifted my hood I had brought, and slid away into the forest behind me.

In the trees quite far away, I could faintly make out several cloaked silhouettes that were well hidden in the trees and bushes. Assassins. I had never found the reason why before, but from what it seems, one of the noble families living in my town had apparently made the wrong enemies, and it was going to hit back at them today. 

I had no reason to fight them, since the person they were after was not important to me so instead, I sat back and prepared to watch the show. The person they were after was the first son of the Solomon family. A rather wealthy and influential family, but not as famous as others in my town. I looked at the target, who was a young child with orange hair, brown eyes, in expensive clothing. To his left were a few guards, and to his right stood a maid. Judging the assassins, I would reckon that they were pretty decent fighters, so I’m sure the guards would get killed pretty fast.

Their leader made a hand gesture, and all of the assassins jumped out of hiding. With incredible speed, they sped past the great distance from the forest to the target and prepared to strike. One of the guards who was rather alert first noticed it. He gave a yell and swung his sword at one of the attackers, only to have it cleaved in half in the next second. There was a clang and a dent in his armour materialized. It would seem that his armour protected his neck from getting slashed, luckily for him. 

The second guard was not so lucky. One of the assassins struck the crack in his armour behind his head, and he fell with a thud. As many people started to finally realize what was going on, screams pierced the air. How unprofessional. A high skilled assassin team would have never let such a thing happen. A quick leap, stab, and exit would have taken place, people only realizing what had happened only long after they were gone.

As more shouting and screaming was heard, I sighed again. Once an assassin is found, they would have to kill everyone who saw them. This meant that the entire caravan would be massacred, and although me going alone to the capital wouldn’t be much of a problem, it was still unpreferable.

But then I noticed it. A very familiar voice was screaming in the mess. I couldn’t pinpoint who it was but… wait… oh shoot… was it Marsha? Why was she here?

I quickly got up and began running back towards the caravan, at Marsha’s voice. Looking through the mess of guards and assassins fighting, screaming and neck slashing, I found her! She was covering behind one of the carriages. Muttering under my breath Oh dear, I ran towards her and planned to take her away to safety. 

Then, I felt an odd sensation. Despite me having no passive magic sensing right now, I had been able to interact with mana long enough in my previous life to perceive when somebody is watching me. Gripping the only weapon I had, the wooden sword, I turned around as I stood beside Marsha.

White eyes, almost glowing compared to the black backdrop of his clothing. One of the assassins was watching me. How inconvenient.

“B-Brother… I’m sor..”

“Shut it. I don’t want to hear it. Save your explanation for later.” I stated in a cold tone.
My eyes narrowed at the assassin who was now seemingly preparing to leap over and attempt to kill us. I’d never imagine having to get into such a situation like this. Previously, I didn’t even know my sister was with us in the caravan. She only appeared at school a few months after I left… or so I thought anyways. At that time I wasn’t very keen with my surroundings and I probably didn’t see her. And the assassins originally had been very clean, with only the noble son dead, and nobody else. How come it was different this time?

Perhaps the cleaness was out of luck the first time. Nevertheless, the situation now was dire. It was a life lesson to not make any emotional connection to anyone, but I suppose there’s no helping it now. I pulled a mana stone out of my pocket. I had bought it in preparation for school training, but I guess I had to use it now. I didn’t even establish my meridians yet, so I wasn’t sure how long my body would last.

Gritting my teeth, I merged the mana from the stone into my hand, and slowly drew it into my body, into the sword as well. The mana stone was a brown one, meaning the mana effect would fortify my body, the sword and give me strength. 

“Oh, wanting to fight? Just die a quick death for me to make my job easier.” The assassin remarked, making his leap towards me, dagger glinting in the moonlight.

“Shut your damn trap.” I shouted back and leapt at him.

A clang resonated alongside the shouting, and both of us were knocked back; though I was knocked back much further, thrown against the carriage.

“Brother! Are you ok…”

“SHUT UP MARSHA!” I angrily shouted. 

I did not have time to listen to my sister’s words. I had to maintain absolute focus if I were to want to get both of us out alive. I leapt first this time back at him, and swung. He took his dagger and parried, a perfect opening I was waiting for. I swung my other hand and punched his stomach.

With all my forward momentum, I rolled back into a kneeling position and got up. 

“Not bad, kid, but you’ll have to have more than that to hurt me.”

Even with a fortified body, it would seem that my punch just couldn’t damage his mana fortified body. How inconvenient. I quickly grabbed out a blue and green mana crystal, and absorbed them. A green crystal would allow me to move faster and avoid some of his attacks, while the blue one would allow me to see his movements and cast longer ranging spells.

I focused my mind and a circle materialized beneath where he stood. He leapt away right before a column of flame shot up. While he was in the air, I jumped and swung my sword at his neck.

Another clang, revealing he blocked my attack. I heard him grunt, probably out of surprise I could do such a thing, but I didn’t give him any chance to recover, swinging my sword again and again at him, but not a single swing managed to hit him. 

Then, out of instinct, I ducked. The whooshing of air could be heard above me. I leapt back to where my sister was. This was getting more dire. It seemed that another assassin had joined into this fight. 

“Dammit dammit DAMMIT!” I shouted, getting more and more frustrated.

With my current body, I could do nothing against two. With one I could stand my ground, but with two… I would die in a few moments. Wait… there is something I could do though… but that would kill many people in the process. I had to protect Marsha… 

I could cast an area protection spell on the caravan itself. I could easily distinguish the caravan members with the power of the green mana crystal through the assassin’s bloodlust, but that would mean I would risk dying. Should I cast it only over my sister? It would require more concentration because it meant I would confine mana in a single point instead of letting it flow over a wider area… but… ah nevermind. Casting it only over my sister would be the better option.

I gritted my teeth and cleared my mind, preparing the spells, but I saw both assassins leap at me with their daggers. Oh shoot, I had to do it quickly. I panicked and without the concentration to confine my mana I cast the area protection spell on accident. Wincing a bit at the stress the spell had on my body, I shook my head a bit. Whatever, what’s done is done. There’s no turning back now. I yelled to relieve the pain as I cast the final spell. A white light filled my eyes and an explosion resonated within the air.

Gasping a bit, I sat down, sweat dripping. The spell was a success. It appears that I had killed every assassin within the vicinity, and the members of the caravan were unharmed due to the first area spell I cast. They were saved due to a mistake on my end; how funny.

Pain gripped every area of my body. Moving mana without undergoing proper preparational setup in my body would damage it quite a bit, and the damage induced pain was almost unbearable.

Out of the corner of my eye, I could see another black hooded figure. Aw shoot... he stayed out of my spell’s range. This was very inconvenient. Mana suddenly began to flow around me. The assassin probably after seeing me kill his team was targeting me and trying to cast a spell on me. I couldn’t let that happen. 

“THERE’S STILL ONE GUY OVER THERE!” I shouted on the top of my lungs and channeled my last remaining mana towards him, illuminating the area where he was. 

Suddenly, the wind picked up and I was ejected into the air at an incredible speed. My body fortifications barely helped me not break my neck, but my vision became hazy and dark. I saw an arrow shot from one of the caravan guards strike the last remaining assassin in the chest, and satisfied, I gave a sigh.

The wind spell cast by the assassin sent me over the forest. I wasn’t sure why he cast such a spell and not one that instantly killed me, but perhaps it was because he only knew those types of spells. Well that was of no matter now. I suppose I had a few extra seconds to live. I looked around me as I continued to tumble in the air. Raising my eyebrows a bit, I was rather intrigued with what I saw. I didn’t know there was a cliff so near this forest. We seemed to be on a plateau… I never bothered to look at the geography here in my previous life so this came as quite an odd spectacle to me.

I laughed a bit in my mind as I fell over the cliff. Such a stupid start to a new life. I doubt I could survive this fall, and it seems I had broken a promise I made with Kylaria. Ahahahaha a new life full of hope and positivity? Bullshit. A dark veil cast itself over my eyes and I heaved a sigh.

Pain. It permeated through my body, my mind, and tore at my soul. It was unbearable.
