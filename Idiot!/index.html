                            It was 8:30 AM PST Wednesday April 7th, 2021. I was in Zoom Class(ELA 1-2 H)😅 but nevertheless attempting to polish
                            up my hand-converted trojan page. I had task manager at the bottom left of my screen, and decided it would be a good time to
                            test it out again on Internet Explorer 11. There was a bug where when I used the &lt;iframe&gt; tag, Internet Explorer 11 would prompt
                            the user with a download of the .mp3 sound that was being played. I removed it and went with a new method of sound embed and wanted to see if it worked. 
                            I was prepared, but nevertheless when I openned the page, I was happy to see it worked, but then realized the task manager had stopped
                            responding and there was no entry for Internet Explorer for me to end. I panicked and tried using the command prompt, but the duplicating pages 
                            were already lagging my computer really badly(keep in mind that I was in class still 😬). I ended up having to hard restart 
                            and welp it was really akward rejoining and saying that "my computer suddenly restarted" to my teacher.
                            <br><br>
                            What I'm trying to say is, please don't go to the trojan page not only unprepared, but still having other things to do.
                            Please close everything and finish everything before accessing it. Should you evern decide to test this on your main computer and 
                            not on a Virtual Machine, please open a command prompt window and type in <i>taskkill /f /im *insert browser .exe name*</i> so that
                            you can press enter to kill the browser task whenever things get out of hand!

            </p><br>
            <p>Anyhow, let's begin this 🤗</p><br>
            <h1>What is this?</h1>
            <p>
                Trojan.JS.YouAreAnIdiot is a <u>trojan website</u>. Since it is purely JavaScript/Web based, it will not delete files or anything of that sort;
                instead it is a fork bomb. Originally, it was hosted on <i>https://youdontknowwhoiam.com</i> which was created in 2002, later turning into a
                pornography portal, and finally shutting down in a few years later. A mirror, <i>https://youareanidiot.org</i>, created in 2004 was also availible for 
                a few years, before turning into a different, basically blank page after 2009. In around 2015, the YouTuber going by the name danooct1 recreated the site, 
                but it was taken down, and now the link redirects to a pastebin. In 2018, the YouTuber going by the name Endermanch hosted another mirror of 
                the trojan at <i>https://youareanidiot.cc</i>. However, it seems that it was unfortunately taken down in 2021.
                <br><br>
                Before 2021, if you went to <i>https://youareanidiot.cc</i> on Internet Explorer and then tried to close the tab, you were greeted with the meaning of life:
            </p>
            <ul style="color: rgb(61, 61, 11);"><li>Windows flying around your screen with a .swf file flashing, displaying "you are an idiot!" while singing beautifully about the fact that you are an idiot! 😳</li></ul>
            <p>
                Now though, all four of the sites are down and broken 😔<br>
                But worry not! Here, I've recreated not only the original site, but created two copies of it converted into html5 as well! 😄
                If you're wanting to directly access the recreations, don't feel like reading through all the text that will commence, 
                and <u>have already read the warning and disclaimer</u>, here are section the links:
            </p>
            <ul style="color: rgb(61, 61, 11);">
                <li><a href="#Flash-Recreation">Original recreation, with Flash.</a></li>
                <li><a href="#AdobeAnimate-Recreation">First html5 Adobe Animate converted recreation.</a></li>
                <li><a href="#Hand-Recreation">Second html5 hand converted recreation.</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Anyhow, let's talk about the site structure itself.<br>
                The website is constructed very simply. It has a JavaScript reference and a Flash embed.<br>
                The Flash embed consists of of some words in Times New Roman font, and an exclamation point that is small enough such that it 
                is barely visible without zooming in, structured like this:
            </p>
            <pre>
            you are an idiot!<br>
                  ☺️ ☺️ ☺️
            </pre>
            <p>
                The animation inverts 3 times per second, followed by an audio singing: "You are an idiot! ha ha ha ha ha ha ha <i>&c</i>".<br>
                The JavaScript has a few payloads:
            </p>
            <ul style="color: rgb(61, 61, 11);">
                <li>
                    <b>bookmark() and changeTitle()</b>:<br><span style="color:rgb(82, 30, 30)">On Internet Explorer, this will bookmark the site on the user's browser, 
                    and if the user's version of Internet Explorer is lower than 6.0, the JavaScript will also set the user's homepage to its own website. This won't work
                    in other browsers, as they don't have the same bookmarking methods nor homepage setting methods.</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>openWindow() and procreate()</b>:<br><span style="color:rgb(82, 30, 30)">This will open six small windows directing to another .html file,
                    with the same embed and JavaScript. In browsers other than Internet Explorer, there may be errors in window size.</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>altf4key(), ctrlwkey(), and delkey()</b>:<br><span style="color:rgb(82, 30, 30)">This disables the shortcuts for closing a window, which are
                    <i>ctrl+w</i>, <i>alt+f4</i>, along with the escaping shortcut <i>ctrl+alt+del</i>. If a user attempted to use one of these shortcuts on 
                    Internet Explorer, they will be notified with a popup alert that "[they] are an idiot!" 😉. Unfortunately, this doesn't work correctly on other browsers.</span>

                Note that the JavaScript is really outdated, and Internet Explorer 11 has been made so that it will block the JavaScript(or ActiveX as it's called)
                control unless the domain has been added to the trusted list(or checking the option in the "Advanced --> Security" setting that allows Javascript/ActiveX
                control from a file:/// aka local link). However it can be edited so it works on modern browsers. I probably can do it, as I already converted the Flash embed,
                but considering the fact that I'm too lazy and that it still works on the Internet Explorer 11, which is likely the last version of said browser, probably not. 
                <br><br>I'll give ya'll an update once I do it, or not do it starting from April 8th, 2021 in the space below 😅:
                <br>

                And that's it. There's nothing else to it! 😄. Now time to go over my re-creations! 👍
            </p><br>
            <h1 id="Flash-Recreation">Original recreation, with Flash</h1>
            <p>
                Let me get straight to the point here. Flash v32.0.0.380 and above died on January 12th, 2021 with Adobe's implementation of a timed kill switch. 
                So thus, in order for this to work, you must fix this. Please try this on a Virtual Machine. You have been warned. Now, let's do this 🙂. 
                <br><br>
                First, do a check on the version of Flash you have installed. On your keyboard, type in <img src="index_files/win.png"><i>+r</i> to bring up the run box.
                In the run box, type in <i>appwiz.cpl</i>. This brings up the applications page in the control panel. Scroll until you have found Flash, and look for your
                Flash version, as seen here:
            </p>
            <center><img src="./index_files/appwiz.cpl-flashVersion.png"></center>
            <p>
                Now observe if the version number is above v32.0.0.380(beta). If your version number is v32.0.0.371 or below, then it does not have the kill switch, 
                and you can proceed past all my Flash patching directions. If your version number is v32.0.0.380 or above, continue to follow my steps.
                <br><br>
                I will demonstrate two different methods to bypass the kill switch. Click <a href="#FPMethod1">here</a> for method one, and <a href="#FPMethod2">here</a> for method two.
            </p><br>
            <h2 id="FPMethod1">Method 1</h2>
            <p>
                We will first uninstall Flash. You can do this by right clicking any Flash entry and selecting uninstall. Follow all prompts until uninstallation has finished.
                Repeat this with all entries of Flash you have in the application page.<br>Alternatively, or if you encounter any errors, you can use <a href="./index_files/uninstall_flash_player.exe">this</a>
                uninstaller instead. This is the most recent version of the uninstaller as of April 7th, 2021. In the future if there are any updates, you can find the updated version
                of the uninstaller at the official Adobe Flash uninstaller homepage <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/uninstall-flash-player-windows.html">here</a>.
                <br><br>
                After successfully uninstalling Flash, type in <img src="index_files/win.png"><i>+r</i> again and this time enter <i>%SYSTEMROOT%\system32\Macromed\Flash</i> into the box.
                With administrator permissions, delete everything in this folder. Repeat for <i>%SYSTEMROOT%\SysWOW64\Macromed\Flash</i>, <i>%APPDATA%\Adobe\Flash Player</i>, and <i>%APPDATA%\Macromedia\Flash Player</i>.
                Then, perform a system restart.
                <br><br>
                Now, we can install a version of Flash that does not have the kill switch. Download <a href="./index_files/fp_32.0.0.371_archive.zip">this</a> .zip archive of v32.0.0.371 
                Flash player installers, or alternatively, download it from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200618035158/https://fpdownload.macromedia.com/pub/flashplayer/installers/archive/fp_32.0.0.371_archive.zip">archive.org</a>.
                For a full index of all Flash versions, please <a href="./index_files/flashplayerarchive_archive.torrent">torrent</a> it, or visit <a href="https://archive.org/details/flashplayerarchive">archive.org</a> for direct downloads.
                <br><br>
                Once you have the Flash v32.0.0.371 .zip archive, navigate to the directory <i>./32_0_r0_371/</i> and run <i>flashplayer32_0r0_371_winax.msi</i> to install ActiveX Flash. 
                Or, if you feel like it, run all three .msi installers in the aforementioned directory to install all versions of v32.0.0.371 Flash. Restart your computer once you have installed Flash.
            </p>
            <h2 id="FPMethod2">Method 2</h2>
            <p>
                Download v1.5(2021/04/02) FlashPatch, a Flash installation modifier which bypasses the January 12th, 2021 kill switch that prevents you from running Flash starting January 12th <a href="./index_files/FlashPatch.exe">here</a>.
                As of April 7th, 2021, this is the most updated version of FlashPatch. In the future if there are any updates, you can find the updated version of FlashPatch at its official GitHub homepage <a href="https://github.com/darktohka/FlashPatch">here</a>.
                <br><br>
                After downloading it, please run it and click <i>Patch</i> as shown below.
            </p>
            <center><img src="./index_files/FPv1.5.png"></center>
            <p>This should return system-wide Flash access. In case anything goes haywire, run the FlashPatch application again and press <i>Restore</i> to revert any changes that it made.</p>
            <h2>The Flash site</h2>
            <p>
                You should have the Flash addon (automatically) added to all of your browsers is you followed the steps above, and if not manually add them.<br>
                Before I give the link, note that again, <b><u>you should be doing this on a Virtual Machine</u></b>. Now that is out of the way, open Internet Explorer, which should come preinstalled with
                all Windows 10 installation media/.isos that were created before August 17th, 2021.

            <h1 id="AdobeAnimate-Recreation">First html5 Adobe Animate converted recreation</h1>
            <p>
                Since Flash died, I wanted to convert the .swf object to an html5 canvas. A quick online search yielded in the fact that 
                <abbr title="😉Enjoy! M0nkrus is a trusted repacker too so don't worry😄"><a href="http://w14.monkrus.ws/search?q=animate">Adobe Animate</a></abbr> could convert Flash
                into html5. So I loaded the <a href="./Converted/Source/YouAreAnIdiot!.swf">.swf</a> into <a href="https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler">JPEX Flash Decompiler</a>, 
                exported a <a href="./Converted/Source/YouAreAnIdiot!.fla">.fla</a> file that Adobe Animate could read. Using the conversion tool, I converted the 
                .fla into an <a href="./Converted/Source/YouAreAnIdiot!-converted-html5-via-Adobe-Animate.fla">html5 canvas</a>, and exported it.
                <br><br>
                And it worked!!!... sort of...<br>
                The html5 and JavaScript were quite complicated, and I took a couple of hours to decipher and understand the code.
                The sound would not play on modern browsers unless the user interacted with the page(i.e. a click) and even then it would take it's sweet time to arrive 
                at one's sound outputs, but would autoplay on Internet Explorer. I took some time to center it on the page, but couldn't get sizing to work.
                <br><br>
                In the end, it kinda worked, but the sizing of the animation was still not very good. On the main html page, it would be too small, and on the smaller 
                bouncy windows, the animation would be too big. Nevertheless it still worked so I guess that's something.<br>
                <font style="color:rgb(30, 82, 30)">And will I someday fix this sizing problem?</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;
                <marquee direction = "up" width="3%"><span style="background-color: rgb(0, 255, 0);">&nbsp;Yes&nbsp;</span></marquee>
                <font style="color:rgb(151, 0, 0)"><b>SIKE! I meant</b></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;
                <marquee width="4%"><span style="background-color: red;">&nbsp;&nbsp;No&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></marquee>
                <br>So yea unfortunately I will not be bothering to fix this. It's just really not worth it to be honest. Hey, it's good enough alright? 😅<br>
                As for the link, again, note that <b><u>you should be doing this on a Virtual Machine</u></b>.<br><br>
                Open Internet Explorer, and in the browser link entry box, enter/navigate to<br>
                <abbr title="AGAIN, TAKE GREAT PRECAUTION WHEN GOING HERE!">
                    <input style="width:727px" type="text" value="captainchicky.github.io/Idiot!/Converted/html5-via-AdobeAnimate/YouAreAnIdiot!-html5-conversion-via-Adobe-Animate.html" id="FlashLink2">

            <p>And again, good luck 😉.</p><br>
            <h1 id="Hand-Recreation">Second html5 hand converted recreation</h1>
            <p>
                Of course, the sizing bug really bothered me, and I didn't want to go through all that code Adobe Animate generated to fix it. Thus, I opted
                to create the animation from scratch.
                <br><br>
                The animation itself was simple enough. Two alternating images and some autoplaying audio. The alternating images was pretty straightforward.
                We can use the following html below...<br>
            </p>
            <pre class="html">
                <span style="color: black;">&lt;</span><span style="color: #dc143c;">div</span> <span style="color: #008000;">class</span><span style="color: black;">=</span><span style="color: #483d8b;">"wrapper"</span><span style="color: black;">></span>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: black;">&lt;</span><span style="color: #dc143c;">img</span> <span style="color: #008000;">src</span><span style="color: black;">=</span><span style="color: #483d8b;">"./<i>path</i>/black.png"</span><span style="color: black;">></span>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: black;">&lt;</span><span style="color: #dc143c;">img</span> <span style="color: #008000;">src</span><span style="color: black;">=</span><span style="color: #483d8b;">"./<i>path</i>/white.png"</span><span style="color: black;">></span>
                <span style="color: black;">&lt;</span><span style="color: #dc143c;">/div</span><span style="color: black;">></span></pre>
            <p>
                ...and by adding a fade-in and fade-out CSS and then positioning them on top of each other, as shown below...

                ...we're basically halfway done!<br>
                Unfortunately, this is where it get's really tricky. Putting the audio on the page isn't hard. Autoplaying it is. 
                Because most modern browsers do not support autoplaying audio, I wanted to first guarentee the autoplay worked on Internet Explorer (11), 
                and then work towards getting it to work on other browsers such as FireFox, Google Chrome, or Microsoft Edge.
                According to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50490304/how-to-make-audio-autoplay-on-chrome">this</a> StackOverflow question,
                we can use an &lt;iframe&gt; tag to autoplay. Thus, we have that

            <p>
                Good! Now, let's give it a test run! We open it up in Internet Explorer, the flashing images are working, the audio is autoplaying... wait... what's this?
            </p>
            <center><img src="./index_files/downloadmp3prompt.png"></center>
            <p>
                That's not good. It seems Internet Explorer registers the &lt;iframe> tag as a download trigger, and all subsequent windows the you.js that we will 
                want to implement in the page in the future will have such a notification.
                <br><br>
                Hmm... let's try something different. What about... this?
            </p>
            <pre class="html">
        <span style="color: black;">&lt;</span><span style="color: #dc143c;">audio</span> <span style="color: #008000;">id</span><span style="color: black;">=</span><span style="color: #483d8b;">"IdiotAudio"</span> <span style="color: #008000;">loop</span><span style="color: black;">>&lt;</span><span style="color: #dc143c;">source</span> <span style="color: #008000;">src</span><span style="color: black;">=</span><span style="color: #483d8b;">"./Idiot!_files/Idiot!.mp3"</span> <span style="color: #008000;">type</span><span style="color: black;">=</span><span style="color: #483d8b;">"audio/mp3"</span><span style="color: black;">>&lt;</span><span style="color: #dc143c;">/audio</span><span style="color: black;">></span>
        <span style="color: black;">&lt;</span><span style="color: #dc143c;">script</span><span style="color: black;">></span>
            <span style="color: #66cc66;">var</span> <span style="color: black;">myaudio = document.getElementById(</span><span style="color: rgb(145, 156, 79);">"IdiotAudio"</span><span style="color: black;">).autoplay = </span><span style="color: #66cc66;">true</span><span style="color: black;">;</span>
        <span style="color: black;">&lt;</span><span style="color: #dc143c;">/script</span><span style="color: black;">></span></pre>
            <p>
                Ok, let's see if this works. We open the page with Internet Explorer and observe what it does. Hooray! It worked! There was no download prompt and 
                the animation along with the autoplaying audio played with no impediment!
                <br><br>
                Ok, now we proceed to the second step. 🤔 Will this work on modern browsers? We open it up in Google Chrome and see if it works... and the audio doesn't play.
                😔 It would seem to be that modern browsers disallow autoplaying audio, which is for the best to be honest, but presents a pretty large problem for us
                in attempts to recreate this. 
                <br><br>
                But wait... I've been testing autoplaying on a <i>local</i> file:/// link... 🤔 Let's try this on an https:// link instead. So I upload my html to the GitHub pages
                server, and then go to the https:// link... and sure enough, <b>it worked</b>!!!
                <br><br>
                I did a couple more tests on different browsers, and here are the results:

                Do note that sizing is still <i>kinda</i> a problem, but let's be honest here, html5 is never going to be the same as Flash 😔, so this is the best we can do for now.
                In regards to the link, smh again I can't reiterate this enough: <b><u>you should be doing this on a Virtual Machine</u></b>!<br><br>
                Anyhow, open Internet Explorer, and in the browser link entry box, enter/navigate to

                So basically I'm done here! 😊 I was able to recreate not only the original Flash site, but also two versions of it in html5 as well!
                All of the recreations have a working animation and the window moving mechanism. I've also established an in depth explanation for each of the 
                recreations here on this very page! The end, I guess 😘.
                <br><br>
                This is the first webdev project I've ever completed (excluding the fact that I might update the you.js to a newer more compatable version, 
                but let's be honest here, I probbaly won't since I'm really lazy 😜), and I'm pretty proud of myself 🤣. The idea sprung up in November 2020 when
                I got interesting in the JavaScript trojan itself from danooct1's YouTube video, and I completed the project on 16:00 PST April 8th 2021.
                I'll probably work on my other projects in the meantime and clean up my webpage.
