                            It was 8:30 AM PST Wednesday April 7th, 2021. I was in Zoom Class(ELA 1-2 H)ðŸ˜… but nevertheless attempting to polish
                            up my hand-converted trojan page. I had task manager at the bottom left of my screen, and decided it would be a good time to
                            test it out again on Internet Explorer 11. There was a bug where when I used the &lt;iframe&gt; tag, Internet Explorer 11 would prompt
                            the user with a download of the .mp3 sound that was being played. I removed it and went with a new method of sound embed and wanted to see if it worked. 
                            I was prepared, but nevertheless when I openned the page, I was happy to see it worked, but then realized the task manager had stopped
                            responding and there was no entry for Internet Explorer for me to end. I panicked and tried using the command prompt, but the duplicating pages 
                            were already lagging my computer really badly(keep in mind that I was in class still ðŸ˜¬). I ended up having to hard restart 
                            and welp it was really akward rejoining and saying that "my computer suddenly restarted" to my teacher.
                            <br><br>
                            What I'm trying to say is, please don't go to the trojan page not only unprepared, but still having other things to do.
                            Please close everything and finish everything before accessing it.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </p><br>
            <p>Anyhow, let's begin this ðŸ¤—</p>
            <h1>What is this?</h1>
            <p>
                Trojan.JS.YouAreAnIdiot is a <u>trojan website</u>. Since it is purely JavaScript/Web based, it will not delete files or anything of that sort;
                instead it is a fork bomb. Originally, it was hosted on <i>https://youdontknowwhoiam.com</i> which was created in 2002, later turning into a
                pornography portal, and finally shutting down in a few years later. A mirror, <i>https://youareanidiot.org</i>, created in 2004 was also availible for 
                a few years, before turning into a different, basically blank page in 2009.
                <br><br>
                Before 2010, if you went to <i>https://youareanidiot.org</i> and then tried to close the tab, you were greeted with the meaning of life:
            </p>
            <ul style="color: rgb(61, 61, 11);"><li>Windows flying around your screen with a .swf file flashing, displaying "you are an idiot!" while singing beautifully about the fact that you are an idiot! ðŸ˜³</li></ul>
            <p>
                Now though, both sites are down and broken ðŸ˜”<br>
                But worry not! Here, I've recreated not only the original site, but created two copies of it converted into html5 as well! ðŸ˜„
                If you're wanting to directly access the recreations, and <u>have already read the warning and disclaimer</u>, here are the links:
            </p>
            <ul style="color: rgb(61, 61, 11));">
                <li><a href="#Flash-Recreation">Original recreation, with flash.</a></li>
                <li><a href="#AdobeAnimate-Recreation">First html5 Adobe Animate converted recreation.</a></li>
                <li><a href="#Hand-Recreation">Second html5 hand converted recreation.</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                You Are An Idiot is an animated file that consists of the following text in the Times New Roman font. Note that the exclamation point is 
                small enough that it is barely visible without zooming in.

                payload
                you are an idiot!
                â˜º â˜º â˜º
                The screen will flashes into black and white, followed by choirs singing: "You are an idiot! ha ha ha ha ha ha ha", annoying the user.

                
                You Are An Idiot
                You Are An Idiot was the original version of the virus. If the user enters the domain: YouAreAnIdiot.org and closed the window immediately, 6 additional windows of the website would spawn and move across the screen, annoying the user until their computer would eventually crash from lag due to the computer running out of RAM and CPU power to keep running the browser windows. If the user managed to close one, it would spawn 6 more windows of the You Are An Idiot windows. Pressing Ctrl+Alt+Del and Alt+F4 on the keyboard wouldn't work. Instead, it displayed a dialogue box saying You are an idiot!, and clicking OK or the X button would just close the window. They could turn it off by restarting their computer or killing the browser tasks with Task Manager.
                
                The original name of this Trojan is named Trojan.JS.Offiz according to the antivirus program, Kaspersky.
                
                Today, the website only just plays the video and does not open up any other windows anymore. However, the site was revived in three different web addresses with the code slightly modified. Older versions of the website can also be found on the Wayback Machine. If the user tries using it on The Wayback Machine today, there's a small chance it will duplicate, and a large chance only 1 window will bounce around.
                
                You Are An Idiot 2
                File:Hey!!!!!!! My new virus!-0
                ComputerVirusWatch demonstrates his website.
                You Are An Idiot 2 is very similar to You Are An Idiot. This threat was created by Computer Virus Watch in 2013. The goal of the threat is to demonstrate how the original You Are An Idiot threat exploits vulnerabilities in the system. This threat's code was removed from the website on the same year, but was later recreated and modified in two different websites and is now cross-platform.
                
                YouareanIdiot.cc
                Endermanch recreated the website with Flash and the popups. Chrome does a good job dealing with the popups. On Chrome OS It Is Easy to Deal with By right clicking google chrome and then clicking close but on Microsoft Windows the only way to deal with it is to Restart as in Chrome OS you cant restart.
                
                Description
                In Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Firefox, and Opera browsers without the popup blocker, when the website is visited, the malware shows a big window that flies over the user's screen, singing that the user is an idiot to pay attention. When the window is closed, it opens 6 more windows to spam the user's computer, and they open the same page, which sings the same You Are An Idiot! song and would fly over the screen, as opposed to the original version. However, this usually can break out into a big pile of error messages.
                
                If the user's version of Internet Explorer is lower than 6.0, the threat sets the user's homepage to its own website. The threat will not work on newer versions, Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, or other desktop browsers unless its popup blocker is completely disabled, excluding IE versions newer than 6.0.
