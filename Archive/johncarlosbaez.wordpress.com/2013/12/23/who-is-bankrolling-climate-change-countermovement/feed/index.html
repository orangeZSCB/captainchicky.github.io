&quot;Global greening&quot; quite possibly produces more straw: Somewhere the increased NPP of C3-plants has to go. What I find foolish is generalizing from laboratory/greenhouse to outside reality. Best example is the recent IR8 rice yield decline (not necessarily its straw yield). We can&#039;t live from carbohydrates alone. CO2+H2O+light only gives carbohydrates.

An excellent picture of the complexity of this matter is given here: http://www.skepticalscience.com/co2-plant-food-advanced.htm]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice video illustrating the effect of CO2 on plant growth:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2qVNK6zFgE#t=0

The positive impact the extra CO2 has on agricultural productivity alone far outweighs any hypothetical negative effects. 

And then there is it&#039;s potential to prevent the next ice age.

Overall fossil fuels are a blessing. Future generations will likely look back at our time with envy seeing how we not only have cheap and plentiful energy but how just using it also fertilizes our atmosphere significantly increasing food production.]]></description>

Péter, you’re making quite a fool out of yourself. E.g. your reference to global greening.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I can see you are overtly unbiased and polite. Also, you are readily denying empirical facts like global NPP (Net Primary Production) and foliage cover in regions where it used to be undersaturated have increased considerably during the last several decades. You must be a great fan of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_constructivism#Radical_constructivism&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;radical constructivism&lt;/a&gt;.

(Comment moderated by JB last night, enhanced by MG today)

Péter: &lt;i&gt;global greening&lt;/i&gt;... Please forget about this old denialist canard. (Hilarious video: &lt;a href=&quot;http://climatecrocks.com/2010/08/16/the-co2-is-plant-food-crock/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;CO2 is plant food&lt;/a&gt;.)

Let&#039;s have a look at how the most important and best studied food plant is doing nowadays: Rice. The elevated CO2 doesn&#039;t help when disproportionally increased night temperature entails disproportionally increased loss of the day&#039;s photoassimilates due to increased metabolism. (Now guess what&#039;s a major fingerprint of global warming...) E.g. a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/101/27/9971.short&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;classic paper by Peng et al. (PNAS 2004)&lt;/a&gt; reports from the IRRI research farm (of green revolution fame)...
 &lt;blockquote&gt;that annual mean maximum and minimum temperatures have increased by 0.35°C and 1.13°C, respectively, for the period 1979 –2003 and a close linkage between rice grain yield and mean minimum temperature during the dry cropping season (January to April). &lt;b&gt;Grain yield declined by 10% for each 1°C&lt;/b&gt; increase in growing-season minimum temperature in the dry season, whereas the effect of maximum temperature on crop yield was insignificant. This report provides a direct evidence of decreased rice yields from increased nighttime temperature associated with global warming.&lt;/blockquote&gt;(My emph.)
 For a laboratory observation of tomatoes see e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://aob.oxfordjournals.org/content/63/3/357&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt; in the Annals of Botany 1989. And this all isn&#039;t even about extreme weather stress or the basic &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liebig%27s_law_of_the_minimum&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Liebig&#039;s law of the minimum&lt;/a&gt;.

I&#039;ve read about the rice thing first in Alan Weisman&#039;s remarkable 2013 book, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Countdown-Last-Best-Future-Earth/dp/0316097756&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Countdown&lt;/a&gt;. He has visited IRRI and reports
&lt;blockquote&gt;a 15 percent average drop in yields of IRRI&#039;s &quot;miracle rice&quot; variety, IR8, that helped avert famine in Asia during the 1960s.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

André Joyal recommended:
&lt;blockquote&gt;http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/12/the-danger-of-cosmic-genius/308306/&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This finally spoiled the nightly half of my work day! I herewith declare ths article &lt;b&gt;required reading&lt;/b&gt; for anybody taking part in the &quot;climate debate&quot;. E.g. the little Dysons commenting here. The psychological insight is just a start (or, anecdotal evidence). For more I suggest &lt;a href=&quot;http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/living-denial&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Kari Norgaard’s book&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Norgaard finds that for the highly educated and politically savvy residents of Bygdaby, global warming was both common knowledge &lt;b&gt;and unimaginable&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
E.F. Schumacher&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Guide_for_the_Perplexed&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;A Guide for the Perplexed&lt;/a&gt; also gives some background:
&lt;blockquote&gt;a man who fails to pursue self-knowledge is and remains a danger to society&lt;/blockquote&gt;
But please forget about Schumacher/Aristotle&#039;s &quot;correspondence theory&quot; of truth, which the quote reduces ad absurdum. As Stephen Batchelor &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.de/books?id=qUOLkrqQK-8C&#038;lpg=PA177&#038;ots=smuoi-LBEh&#038;dq=%22stephen%20batchelor%22%20%22dharma%20gaia%22&#038;hl=de&#038;pg=PA181#v=onepage&#038;q=%22stephen%20batchelor%22%20%22dharma%20gaia%22&#038;f=false&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;What is needed above all is ... a turning about in the deepest seat of consciousness - in this case, a return to the pulsating throb of life away from the Cartesian abstractions that still haunt us in spite of ourselves.&lt;/blockquote&gt;...and especially haunt Freeman Dyson - see the recommended article for a hilarious quote.

<p>This finally spoiled the nightly half of my work day! I herewith declare ths article <b>required reading</b> for anybody taking part in the &#8220;climate debate&#8221;. E.g. the little Dysons commenting here. The psychological insight is just a start (or, anecdotal evidence). For more I suggest <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/living-denial" rel="nofollow">Kari Norgaard’s book</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Norgaard finds that for the highly educated and politically savvy residents of Bygdaby, global warming was both common knowledge <b>and unimaginable</b>.</p></blockquote>
<p>E.F. Schumacher&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Guide_for_the_Perplexed" rel="nofollow">A Guide for the Perplexed</a> also gives some background:</p>
<blockquote><p>a man who fails to pursue self-knowledge is and remains a danger to society</p></blockquote>
<p>But please forget about Schumacher/Aristotle&#8217;s &#8220;correspondence theory&#8221; of truth, which the quote reduces ad absurdum. As Stephen Batchelor <a href="http://books.google.de/books?id=qUOLkrqQK-8C&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;ots=smuoi-LBEh&amp;dq=%22stephen%20batchelor%22%20%22dharma%20gaia%22&amp;hl=de&amp;pg=PA181#v=onepage&amp;q=%22stephen%20batchelor%22%20%22dharma%20gaia%22&amp;f=false" rel="nofollow">explains</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>What is needed above all is &#8230; a turning about in the deepest seat of consciousness &#8211; in this case, a return to the pulsating throb of life away from the Cartesian abstractions that still haunt us in spite of ourselves.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;and especially haunt Freeman Dyson &#8211; see the recommended article for a hilarious quote.</p>
<p>(More elaboration perhaps at planet3.org)</p>
