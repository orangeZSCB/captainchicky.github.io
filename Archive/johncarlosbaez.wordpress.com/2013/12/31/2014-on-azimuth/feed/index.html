					<description><![CDATA[I think that it is not necessary the Maxwell’s demon to create a reduction of entropy in a thermodynamic system: each thermodynamic system with two part in equilibrium, have ever entropy fluctuations, so that always happen little violation of the second law of the thermodynamic (heat flow from a colder body to a warmer body); if the Clausius statement is false in this case, then it is not applicable ever.
It is impossible to obtain energy in this system, because of the impossibility of a perpetuum motion (I think that this is the true second law of thermodynamics), that for each reservoirs (with each temperature and pressure) is not possible to use fluctuation to obtain mechanical energy.
So that I have a problem with the use of a Lyapunov function to obtain a better choice of the entropy, because I think that for systems in equilibrium there is no function that can measure an increase of the time (there is not a thermodynamic arrow of time, only time reversible fluctuations).]]></description>
