					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2013/12/05/talk-at-the-seti-institute/#comment-34292&quot;&gt;Arrow&lt;/a&gt;.

I wrote that abstract half a year ago.   I&#039;m more inclined these days to lump in global warming as part of a bigger situation, the Anthropocene.  That&#039;s what I did in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/balsillie/balsillie_what.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;talk on &#039;What is Climate Change?&#039;&lt;/a&gt; a couple months ago.  So, that&#039;s the tack I&#039;ll take now.

What matters when pondering the search for intelligent life is not whether the Anthropocene will kill off life on Earth: obviously it won&#039;t.  What matters is whether it will prevent our civilization from spreading across the galaxy, or putting resources into sending signals to other planets.   And the reason it matters is that what happens, or &lt;i&gt;could happen&lt;/i&gt;, to our civilization is one of the few clues we have about what happens to other civilizations.  I&#039;ll argue that &#039;tragedy of the commons / prisoner&#039;s dilemma&#039; situations can arise in the course of the development of intelligent life, which have the potential to knock down civilizations.  These can also happen before intelligence arises.  The &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Oxygenation_Event&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;oxygen catastrophe&lt;/a&gt; is a good example of how life can survive these &#039;tragedy of the commons&#039; situations if they happen slowly enough for evolution to find a way out.   Perhaps on some planets situations arise where evolution doesn&#039;t find a way out.

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;collision with the planet Theia, the oxygen catastrophe, the snowball Earth events, the Permian-Triassic mass extinction event, the asteroid that hit Chicxulub, and more, including the global warming episode we are causing now&quot;

Kinda hilarious to put global warming on that list, if anything you should put homo sapiens and associated habitat loss.

Apart from that it seems the only close call for life in general would be a collision with a large enough astronomical body to melt all the crust, otherwise the life would surely survive in some form. Half the genera dying off might seem extreme to us but from the perspective of life in general succeeding it&#039;s completely insignificant. 

As for SETI, aliens radio silence has probably much more to do with apathy then anything else. The lack of purpose to life is a natural barrier to any intelligent life. There&#039;s only so much intelligence you can have and still maintain a positive enough outlook on life to want to reproduce...]]></description>

I&#039;m glad &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.3381&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sharov and Gordon&lt;/a&gt; know about Petri nets:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The general notion of self-reproduction has been defined using the formalism of Petri nets (Sharov, 1991). In short, a system is self-reproducing if there is a finite sequence of transitions (i.e., reactions) that results in the increase of the numbers of all components within the system.  For example, the formose reaction is autocatalytic and makes sugars from formaldehyde (Huskey and Epstein, 1989). Such reactions can propagate in space, which is similar to the growth and expansion of populations of living organisms (Gray and Scott, 1994; Tilman and Kareiva, 1997). Autocatalytic reactions have two alternative steady states: &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot; (the &quot;on&quot; state is stabilized via a limited supply of resources). Thus, they represent the most simple hereditary system or memory unit (Jablonka and Szathmáry, 1995; Lisman and Fallon, 1999). For example,a reverse citric acid cycle, which captures carbon
dioxide and converts it into sugars, may become self-sustainable, at least theoretically (Morowitz, et al., 2000). Prions are examples of autocatalytic reproduction (Griffith, 1967; Laurent, 1997; Watzky, et al., 2008), and indeed have been invoked in various ways in speculations on theorigin of life (Steele and Baross, 2006; Maury, 2009; Hu, et al. , 2010). However, they cannot support the synthesis of the primary (i.e.,unfolded) polypeptide. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Here’s the SETI-talk relevance: if evolution is as slow as they claim, if it takes 9 billion years to get from chemistry to civilization, then the Drake eqn is wrong: there simply has not been enough time to evolve ETI from bacteria. This ‘solves’ the Fermi paradox.

How does that square with your claim that their calculation &quot;strongly suggests extraterrestrial origins of basic life-forms&quot;?]]></description>

Oh, they don&#039;t stop at 4.5 billion years: they extrapolate back to 9+/- 2 billion  years. :-)

Its OK to be skeptical. They address a wide swath of concerns more or less squarely; I find the arguments plausible; I&#039;m sure that domain experts could be strongly critical.  They have to defend against a dozen or more skeptical attacks on widely different topics in a small amount of space.

They devote maybe 1/4th to 1/3rd of the paper to primitive biochemistry.  They promptly dismiss the idea of having polypeptides, oligonucleotides being present from the very beginning. They review and dismiss some simpler models (hypercycles, the &#039;autocatalytic set&#039;, the GARD model).

They do like something called &#039;coenzyme world&#039; where coenzymes (e.g. ATP, NADH, and CoA) colonize droplets of hydrocarbons in water. (something we might expect to find on Titan, Enceladus) which then catalyze hydrocarbons into fatty acids.  They spill some fair amount of verbiage on how this could slowly mutate into cells, e.g. by catalyzing glycerol (needed to make hydrocarbon emulsions stable in water.)

Next, a description of the invention of &#039;digital replication&#039; viz autocatalytic polypetides, oligonucleotides, which start out by stabilizing lipid membranes. etc. What they write is clearly just a sketch -- there&#039;s enough material to be covered that, by golly, you could have dozens of conferences and newly minted PhD&#039;s -- and, by golly, judging from the bio-evolution-game-theory-complexity blogosphere, these conferences and PhD&#039;s are showing up at a rapid clip.

Many of their arguments resonate for me, so I find it plausible.]]></description>
