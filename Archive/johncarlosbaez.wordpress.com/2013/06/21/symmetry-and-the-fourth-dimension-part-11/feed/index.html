					<description><![CDATA[Just as the cube serves as the exemplar of three-dimensional space, the tesseract serves as the exemplar of four-dimensional space. The word “tesseract” was coined by mathematician Charles Howard Hinton (from an obscure Greek prefix meaning “four”). It’s more common nowadays to call the tesseract a hypercube, though the term “hypercube” is also used generically to refer to an n-dimensional cubes for any value of n bigger than 3.

The tesseract entered popular culture through Madeleine L’Engle’s “A Wrinkle in Time”, though L’Engle caused some of her readers confusion when one of the characters in “A Wrinkle in Time”, the prodigy Charles Wallace Murray, declared “Well, the fifth dimension’s a tesseract.” L’Engle wasn’t sure how to reconcile Hinton’s ideas about the fourth dimension with Einstein’s, so she put Hinton’s fourth dimension after Einstein’s, demoting it from fourth place to fifth.]]></description>

Cool!  In this kind of math, I think you can safely assume these patterns aren&#039;t coincidences.  The whole idea of a coincidence in mathematics is a bit tricky, since presumably the whole structure is deterministic... but what I mean is, it will pay to ponder these relationships: they&#039;ll lead to something good.

So thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Reading through some of Mark Blacklock&#039;s more recent blog posts, I came across this one:

http://higherspace.wordpress.com/2012/01/03/4d-bibliophilia/

Note in particular Fig 1:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://higherspace.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/long4d.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://higherspace.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/long4d.jpg?w=450&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This is a sequence of sections of a tesseract, going along a diagonal between opposite vertices. Which bears a striking resemblance to the tetrahedron family from &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/09/07/symmetry-and-the-fourth-dimension-part-7/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Part 7&lt;/a&gt; of this series.

In a similar vein, the 24-cell (ICO) according to this site:

http://www.polytope.net/hedrondude/regulars.htm

has this sequence of sections (from one of the cells this time):

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.polytope.net/hedrondude/ICO.JPG&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.polytope.net/hedrondude/ICO.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

which appears to be the octahedron through cuboctahedron of the cube family from &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/08/03/symmetry-and-the-fourth-dimension-part-5/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Part 5&lt;/a&gt;.

Coincidence?]]></description>

Thanks John - very detailed, as I would expect from you! One of the pendulums is rotational (so I guess elliptical, as the gimbal is hand-made and so will not be exactly accurate).

I want to know the pendulum&#039;s frequency, because I understand that there is a relationship with sound frequencies, and apparently the harmonograph can be set to mimic the frequencies of different musical intervals - see &quot;Harmonograph: A visual guide to the mathematics of music&quot; by Anthony Ashton, Wooden Books.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Thank you John – I am still laboring with it in the metal workshop!
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Oh, so the gadget in the picture above is not the harmonograph?  I guess that makes sense---I don&#039;t see a pendulum.  What is that gadget?  It&#039;s beautiful... 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I know that there is a mathematical formula for the pendulum frequencies, but as a non-mathematician it still defeats me – have you written about this anywhere?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It depends what you mean.  There&#039;s a simple approximate formula that&#039;s good if the pendulum doesn&#039;t swing too high:

$latex T \approx 2 \pi \sqrt{L/g} $

Here $latex T$ is the period of the pendulum, $latex L$ is its length, and $latex g$ is the acceleration of gravity, about 9.807 meters/second&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  

However, if the pendulum swings high, its period becomes longer, as you can easily see if you imagine it swinging &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; high, like a child trying to swing all the way over the swing set.  We need a more complicated formula to describe this.  The exact formula involves elliptic integrals, and I&#039;ve written about that... but if your pendulum doesn&#039;t swing &lt;i&gt;too&lt;/i&gt; high, you may be content with &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendulum#Period_of_oscillation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this formula&lt;/a&gt;: not the first one, but the one with correction terms involving $latex \theta_0,$ which is the maximum angle from vertical that the pendulum swings.  

When $latex \theta_0$ is 23&#176;, the simple formula I gave above is wrong by 1%.  When $latex \theta_0$ is 30&#176; the pendulum looks like this:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/Pendulum_30deg.gif&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

and when $latex \theta_0$ is 120&#176; the period is noticeably longer:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/Pendulum_120deg.gif&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

I suspect that your harmonograph will be more complicated.  It&#039;s not just swinging back and forth in one direction: it may be a true &#039;spherical pendulum&#039;, or maybe something even more complicated.  But if it doesn&#039;t swing too high, its period should still be given approximately by the simple formula I wrote down.

Why do you want to know the pendulum&#039;s frequency?]]></description>
