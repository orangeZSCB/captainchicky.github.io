That&#039;s what it was &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/tb/recent&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;created for&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was wondering: how hard is it to convince arXiv.org to add a link to selectedpapers.net? 

What I have in mind is a use case like this: whenever a researcher goes to arXiv.org to read a paper, that page already shows several link-outs. For example, there is NASA ADS, then there are various bookmarks like Mendeley, Sciencewise, etc. So now if I click on Sciencewise, it takes me to the Sciencewise page for the paper.  Can we have a similar bookmark to selectedpapers.net that takes us directly to the page where this paper is being discussed? Then one can directly post to selectedpapers by going to the arXiv page of the paper one is interested in, and clicking on the accompanying selectedpapers link.

If this can be worked out, its a great way of getting the word about selectedpapers out to a large number of researchers. When they go to arXiv to read the paper, they can also access/ add to reviews of that paper.]]></description>

That&#039;s exactly what we&#039;re going to do next -- there is every reason to expand this beyond just Google+.  For example, as Darij pointed out, Google+&#039;s indexing bugs cause a lot of problems and clunky interface.  But we&#039;ve only put about two weeks of development work into this, so I would say it was not bad as a starting point.  Expanding this to Twitter and people&#039;s personal blogs seems like a good next step.  We can also greatly improve how SPN works with Google+, now that we understand its limitations better.  What do people think would be most useful?]]></description>

I agree, too. This is not just a matter of trusting social networks (which I don&#039;t neecessarily do even when I use them for chatter and minutiae), but also a matter of unnecessary complexity. And as my experience with spn illustrates, unnecessary complexity leads to bugs.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think this is great! However, I feel it is important to have a method of interacting with this network, such as posting comments and entering discussions, without the the need to have an account with a proprietary social network such as Google+ or Facebook. Now I did read in your post that other social networks could and will be used, but there should be at least one method that either (a) does not use any social network, or (b) interfaces with an open-source distributed one such as Diaspora.

For instance, one could have some protocol that would allow individuals to register their personal domain or website with the Selected Papers Network, and then some simple code on their domain could allow the individuals to post comments on their own site using hashtags or the like, and then the Selected Papers Network would periodically read the data and display it on its own website.

This system, being a push for open methods in publishing should in principle be completely open, and not be reliant on the whims of corporations (imagine a world where one entity owns every proprietary social network) for the astoundingly simple service of providing a discussion mechanism.]]></description>
