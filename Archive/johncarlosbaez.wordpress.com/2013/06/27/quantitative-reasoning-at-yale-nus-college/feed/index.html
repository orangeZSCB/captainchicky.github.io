					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2013/06/27/quantitative-reasoning-at-yale-nus-college/#comment-31220&quot;&gt;Lee Bloomquist&lt;/a&gt;.

John wrote &quot;... we don’t know what &#039;p&#039; and &#039;q&#039; mean in the stochastic context...&quot;

I wonder about these inverse relationships between probabilities and available information-- could they be candidates for conjugate variables in some context? Channel theory would be involved. Channel theory is about distributed systems where each system has parts with the power to carry information about other parts in the same system-- which can happen because they are all parts of the same system. 

Each part has its own unique pair of possibilities and information available. That might be like the i-th pair of conjugate variables in the Hamiltonian equation.

A human being could be this type of system. There is something constantly invariant in a human being&#039;s life. (Wherever you go, there you are-- It&#039;s you!) But the invariant involved is simply not the real number for energy, as in a physical Hamiltonian.  I don&#039;t know what this function giving the real number H(p,q) in dH/dt = 0 would mean for this kind of system. I&#039;m just conjecturing that it must exist for this idea to work.

At the same time there is constant change. The breath moves between two different points of two different types. But if this movement were to stop forever, any feelings of &quot;Wherever you go, there you are (dH/dt = 0)&quot; cease to exist. Clearly, the process of breathing must be be actively moving from state to state before a human being can feel anything.

Then there&#039;s the solar system. Stop the planets from moving in their orbits around the sun (by somehow sucking away enough energy so they stop dead in their paths), then the planets immediately fall into the sun and our solar system ceases to exist. (dH/dt = 0 -- NOT)

In these two scenarios, admittedly not standard, dynamic balancing acts by the all the parts of the system create and hold the system invariant at dH/dt =0 (whatever H means).  But when the performance of these balancing acts stops, the system is changed maybe to the point of destruction. (dH/dt = 0 -- NOT)

From this I wonder about the large number limit for any distributed system having for its conjugate variables the (p) possibilities and (q) information available for each part of it. The perhaps unusual idea is that each part of the system must perform its own balancing act with its own conjugate variables so as a result, the total system maintains existence in a non-degraded state. At the other extreme, destruction of the system would be guaranteed when each part stops performing its balancing act between possibilities and available information, and violates their inverse relationship. The system is created when all the parts of the system begin their balancing act and destroyed when all the parts of the system fail to perform their balancing act.

Far away from the large number limit, evidence that (a) possibilities for each part of the system exist, and (b) for each part, a history exists of its states and, for each of the states, the information that was available-- taken together mean that the balancing processes were at work up to the last move and that the system was not degrading, in fact every part has possibilities, and therefore by all evidence the system is maintaining existence at some dH/dt = 0 (whatever H means). At the other extreme, if the possibilities for each part cease to exist, and simultaneously each part also proves to have been &quot;live&quot; on its last move (as evident from the above history), then under these conditions a self-destruct transition in the model gets fired to represent destruction of the system. (dH/dt = 0 -- NOT)

From an evolutionary point of view we can compare this to a different kind of system. Say that dH/dt = 0 means a system balancing on a tightrope.    For example, two bicyclists support a pole on their shoulders on which another bicyclist rides, etc. There are gears and axes involved tying everything together. When these kinds of systems degrade, the entire system has to be taken off-line to be maintained.

On the other hand, we can consider a system based on a number of tightrope walkers, each balancing on one&#039;s own tightrope. Somebody getting off-balance on a different tightrope does not physically interfere with any other part of the system, each part of which has its own tightrope. Rather than gears connected to axes and each other, this is more like the juggler in the Ed Sullivan show who gets a zillion plates spinning by means of supporting, off-axis sticks. If any part degrades, it can be replaced on-the-fly while the total system keeps running in a degraded state. The new part begins its balancing act and the system can be restored to dH/dt = 0.

The latter system is probably much easier to create and maintain, while the former is probably much easier to destroy. 

Would evolution agree?]]></description>

As the token homeschooler around here, I&#039;d like to note for the record that Penelope Trunk enjoys taking contrary positions without actually knowing anything about what she&#039;s talking about. People who follow her figure that out quickly enough. I&#039;d be more worried about E.O. Wilson than Penelope Trunk.]]></description>

You&#039;ve reminded me of another practical example, described by David Mermin, I think in his &quot;Boojums All the Way through: Communicating Science in a Prosaic Age&quot;-

The gist is that Mermin sanity-checks his grocery bill by doing a quick mental scan of his cart in the checkout line, and finds that his totally is usually within a dollar or so.  Is Mermin some kind of savant?  No, he just estimates each item to the nearest dollar (which he found pretty easy to do after a little practice); so the error per item averages $0.25, so the total error averages sqrt(n) times this, i.e. roughly a dollar for his typical purchase.]]></description>

Right John.  The ratio between the two averages can be significant, and it&#039;s arguably the first which is more relevant to students.

That said, perhaps the reason no one&#039;s up in arms about this is that the largest classes a) tend to have associated smaller discussion sections, b) have smaller attendance relative to enrollment (though I&#039;m not sure the latter would hold in Singapore:-)

I like your Facebook example as an updating of the (antiquated?-) family size example.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Interesting architecture!

Perhaps of interest for liberal arts dissertations, some work published years ago may already support an application of Category Theory to the liberal arts, specifically to the theory of literary interpretation.  (Jon Barwise. The Situation in Logic. &quot;On the circumstantial relation between meaning and content.&quot;)

https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B9LMgeIAqlIENENELXoycjdFTWM/edit?usp=sharing

Some, more current work presents the idea of a general theory of interpretation. But it is not yet a theory based on category theory. The theory would comprise a theory of legal interpretation, a theory of psychoanalytic interpretation, as well as a theory of literary interpretation. (See for example P. C. Hogan. On Interpretation: Meaning and Inference in Law, Psychoanalysis, and Literature.)
 
http://books.google.com/books?id=E0uePv2wkC8C&#038;lpg=PA6&#038;ots=3uP1WeCAwN&#038;dq=%22theory%20of%20literary%20interpretation%22&#038;pg=PA6#v=onepage&#038;q=%22theory%20of%20literary%20interpretation%22&#038;f=falsellb

Imagine as a result: new career-relevant techniques, perhaps for future lawyers or other professionals, from the fields of Rhetorical Analysis or Rhetorical Criticism. More concretely, imagine using Category Theory to interpret stories, as above, with diagrams that help specify radically better decision-support-systems based on &quot;case-based&quot; reasoning. In this application, &quot;case-based&quot; would mean &quot;story-based&quot;-- where  the story in the case-based reasoning system is the story discussed in the theory of literary interpretation. A test would be that the decision support tools prove useful. 

Because I have been trying to read what I can of John&#039;s blogs, I am starting to think of the kind of story occurring in Socratic &quot;dialectic,&quot; (which is discussed in these fields) to actually be a game where hierarchical self-rewriting Petri nets are manipulated, where places either hold types or situations, where players move by putting either types or situations in appropriate Petri net places, and where the game ends when either (a) the listener to the story quits listening before the end of the story then breaks off and leaves, in which case both lose-- especially in the case with Socrates-- or (b) the listener stays to hear the end of the story, in which case both the storyteller and the listener win.  Winning Socrates&#039; game of dialectic means enough information has been communicated to transform all the important possibilities into impossibilities. 

By comparison, in the rhetoric described by Socrates there is not a two-person game, as in his dialectic. Instead there is a group listening to the person telling the story. The rhetorical story is like an animation, not an interaction, because it is replayed identically each time unless there are unwelcome hecklers. Success would be measured in a different way as well. For example, if half or more of the crowd stays to hear the whole story, then the storyteller wins. But if more than half the crowd leave before the story is finished, the storyteller loses.

So I&#039;m starting to see the act of reading a story-- for example a story about Sherlock Holmes-- itself to be a process of &quot;inquiry&quot; and describable in language now being used on the Azimuth blog.

PS, Barwise used the word &quot;inquiry&quot; in his second-to-last paper titled &quot;Information and Impossibilities&quot;-- in which paper he quotes Sherlock Holmes: &quot;How many times have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth?&quot; Apparently Holmes was an &quot;informationalist&quot;-- a person who takes the inverse relationship between information and possibility as a tenet.  &quot;Whenever there is an increase in available information, there is a corresponding decrease in possibilities, and vice versa.&quot;]]></description>

For estimation, &quot;Street-Fighting Mathematics - The Art of Educated Guessing and Opportunistic Problem Solving&quot; by Sanjoy Mahajan is excellent, although it does require some background.

Might be worth having a look at it! There&#039;s even a free download of the pdf! (If I remember correctly, the author is currently working on a similar book targeted at a more general audience).]]></description>

I concur with estimation being an important topic.  A not-insignificant portion of incorrect answers I see students give on homework, quizzes, etc. could be caught before they submit their answers IF they could properly evaluate a simple question:  &quot;Does this make sense?&quot;  And that can often be gauged with a quick estimate.

For a simple practical example, I calculate my fuel economy every time I fill my gas tank.  Even ignoring past values, if I come up with a number that is off by an order of magnitude, I can tell something went wrong if I estimate the fuel economy using front-end rounding.  This was an absolutely essential skill when calculators were slide rules (they do not supply the order of magnitude), but even now it&#039;s an important skill to be able to tell if the calculator answer makes sense.

I saw a good illustration of why the common erroneous answer to the Monty Hall problem is wrong.  In this variant there are 1000 doors and 999 goats.  All except the door you selected and one other door have been eliminated for you as definitely having goats behind them.]]></description>

David Spiegelhalter was recently interviewed on BBC R4, its a fun interview.

Yes, the Yale-NUS quantitative reasoning class is organized by methods, though they&#039;ll all be illustrated with lots of examples---for example, there will be contests to find the worst examples of flawed quantitative reasoning in newspaper articles, and the students will have projects to take data and convert into &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; newspaper articles, and so on.]]></description>

Speaking of probabilities in everyday life, this book sounds fun:

&#8226; Michael Blastland and David Spiegelhalter, &lt;i&gt;The Norm Chronicles: Stories and Numbers About Danger&lt;/i&gt;, Profile, 2013.

From the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21579801-making-sense-statistics-riddle-our-days-snakes-and-ladders&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Economist&lt;/i&gt; review&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
To make risk comprehensible, the book uses a device called the MicroMort. One MicroMort is a one-in-a-million chance of death, which is roughly the risk of dying from an accident such as a car crash on an ordinary day in Britain.

That baseline allows for some illuminating comparisons. Giving birth in Britain, for instance, exposes the mother to about 120 MicroMorts, about the same risk as riding a motorbike from London to Edinburgh and back, or from 2½ days of active service during the most dangerous period of the war in Afghanistan. (A table at the back of the book makes for compulsive reading.) Life has plainly become much safer in recent decades. This is true even on the battlefield: soldiers in Afghanistan faced around 47 MicroMorts a day, but the aircrews that bombed Germany in the second world war endured about 25,000 MicroMorts per mission.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
