					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll weigh in with some comments, but I think that it would be a good idea for John to write a new post on the elephant in the room, or let me do a guest post on it.

&lt;i&gt;&quot;Why don’t academics rebel and publish in cheaper journals?&quot;&lt;/i&gt;

Many reasons.  But two, which I&#039;ll mention below, haven&#039;t really been discussed much on the web, except by me.

&lt;i&gt;One reason is a broken feedback loop. The academics don’t pay for journals out of their own pocket. Instead, their university library pays for the journals. Rising journal costs do hurt the academics: money goes into paying for journals that could be spent in other ways. But most of them don’t notice this.&lt;/i&gt;

This is a real problem.  And it will become worse now that publishers have boondoggled funding agencies to support &quot;gold open access&quot; (there are lies, damn lies, and gold open access), which means that some high-level institution, perhaps even the federal government (to whom such costs are peanuts, of course).  This means that the money doesn&#039;t even come out of the academics&#039; own institutes.

&lt;i&gt;The other reason is item 4: endorsement. This is the part of academic publishing that outsiders don’t understand. Academics want to get jobs and promotions. To do this, we need to prove that we’re ‘good’. But academia is so specialized that our colleagues are unable to tell how good our papers are. Not by actually reading them, anyway! So, they try to tell by indirect methods—and a very important one is the prestige of the journals we publish in.&lt;/i&gt;

I&#039;m sure that someone wanting to hire me would read my papers.  But he might have to justify his decision to someone from another field who might also have a say.  It is these people whom one needs to impress by publishing in prestigious journals.  (As a side note, putting &lt;i&gt;too much&lt;/i&gt; emphasis on prestigious journals can backfire.  I once heard of an institute which forbade some people from publishing in the leading journal in their field, because in the same year there were a few papers in &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;: such publication would decrease the fraction of papers in &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;!)

So, we need prestigious journals.  The question is how arXiv-overlay journals and so on can become prestigious.  One way is for those who don&#039;t need jobs (because they are retired or already have the best jobs) or promotions (ditto) to take the lead.  Let me mention the &#060;A HREF=&#039;https://astro.theoj.org/&quot;&#062;&lt;i&gt;Open Journal of Astrophysics which has attracted some high-profile authors, but not yet addressed the concerns I express below.

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;The big commercial publishers have bought most of the prestigious journals. We can start new journals, and some of us are already doing that, but it takes time for these journals to become prestigious. In the meantime, most scholars prefer to publish in prestigious journals owned by the big publishers, even if this slowly drives their own libraries bankrupt. This is not because these scholars are dumb. It’s because a successful career in academia requires the constant accumulation of prestige.&lt;/i&gt;

Right.

&lt;i&gt;The Elsevier boycott shows that more and more academics understand this trap and hate it. But hating a trap is not enough to escape the trap.&lt;/i&gt;

Right.

&lt;i&gt;Boycotting Elsevier and other monopolistic publishers is a good thing. The arXiv and PubMed Central are good things, because they show that we can solve the distribution and archiving problems without the help of big commercial publishers. But we need to develop methods of scholarly publishing that solve the selection and endorsement problems in ways that can’t be captured by the big commercial publishers.&lt;/i&gt;

Right.

&lt;i&gt;I emphasize ‘can’t be captured’, because these publishers won’t go down without a fight. Anything that works well, they will try to buy—and then they will try to extract a stream of revenue from it.&lt;/i&gt;

This brings me to the elephant in the room.  Many (most?) prestigious journals are owned by publishers, including 4 of the overpriced ones: Elsevier, Springer, Wiley, and Taylor &#038; Francis.  (There are some journals owned by learned societies where the publishing is outsourced to commercial publishers.)  Subscriptions are often needed to access journals other than the current one.  Not everything is on arXiv.  Of stuff that is, not always is the definitive version there.  Even if it is, this is not always clear.  For astronomy, there are resources such as &lt;a HREF=&quot;http://ads.harvard.edu/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ADS&lt;/a&gt;, and while scans of older journals are available, for new stuff there are often only links to the journal website.  Also, some journals today are online only; there is no paper version unless someone has printed it out, but certainly know library where one knows one can find anything.

Suppose that open-access arXiv-overlay journals and so on are not very successful: they exist as a niche, but aren&#039;t a major perturbation.  Then we haven&#039;t won much.  But suppose that they are successful, leading to the demise of overpriced journals and perhaps even the publishers themselves.  How will the community access the content of these journals?  For copyright reasons, no-one can just pirate it, and as long as the publisher is still in business, why should they be sympathetic to making their content available for free?  If anything, they will oppose it more than they do now.

The only reason that such overpriced journals still exist is that some of them really are good, and it really does mean something to publish there.  I don&#039;t want to see that content disappear.

This might be a reason why some academics are hesitant to support alternative journals.

There is another reason, which applies to arXiv-overlay journals.  Some people don&#039;t want to put stuff on arXiv, for a variety of reasons, most of them legitimate.  Some people are not allowed to by their institute (some have a policy against putting stuff on arXiv before acceptance) or by arXiv (new users have to be endorsed, and so on).  Thus, I think that all arXiv-overlay journals should have an alternate submission mechanism, and not disadvantage papers submitted through it.

There also needs to be an agreement with arXiv along the lines that any paper accepted via the alternative submission process by a (legitimate---to be determined by some process) arXiv-overlay journal will automatically allowed to be published on arXiv (this does not imply that the author has the right to publish anything else there).

So, in summary, for arXiv-overlay journals to really take off, one has to take seriously the people who don&#039;t want to put stuff on arXiv before acceptance, and people who have never used arXiv before and might not easily be able to get an endorsement.

And without a detailed plan for how online journal content will remain available after the demise of commercial publishers, I doubt that any alternatives will make an appreciable dent.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Science, in a nutshell, is about finding flaws - finding flaws in your methodology, your logic, your techniques, and so on. One way to find flaws is through peer review. By &quot;peer&quot;, we mean people who are as knowledgeable as yourself regarding the topic(s) discussed in your published research. This review of your work by your peers is very effective way to find flaws in your research, but what we call peer review today is seriously flawed in its implementation. The process (also in a nutshell) goes like this:

1) Submit your work to a small group of people who publish a widely read magazine

2) This small group of people decide if your paper is worth publishing or not

There are many problems with this, the foremost being that this is not an example of peer review, this is an example of review by a committee. Peer review means that flaws in the published work should be published too. I cannot read a paper on a topic that I am not an expert on and then know with complete certainty if the paper is flawed or not. If that paper is accompanied by a true-to-life peer review, then I can make that determination based on that additional criticism.

Furthermore, there is no way to ensure that the small group of arbitrary people who do the limited &quot;reviewing&quot; will be or will remain unbiased by either money or politics. Both are very heavily involved in this process today. Politics is especially troublesome because it results in the filtering of dissenting or unpopular ideas, especially when that politics is fueled by religious agendas.

Another problem is that there is no way for you to know what ideas or works were rejected or not. If I am using someone else&#039;s paper as a reference and it is flawed, that makes my work flawed, and you cannot pursue the truth based on lies.

Science is not a democracy; you don&#039;t vote for what is fact or not - that is flawed reasoning. The political entity, the IPCC, is very guilty of this nonsense, ultimately determining where resources are allowed to be spent doing research. As history has proven time and time again, politics and science do not work well together, yet here we are, repeating history all over again.

The process of peer review needs to be completely in the hands of peers, not bean counters or CEOs or politicians. The only other thing it would need is to be organized and refereed by mature adults with logical thinking abilities.]]></description>
