					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2013/06/04/symmetry-and-the-fourth-dimension-part-10/#comment-33756&quot;&gt;Jeffrey Haemer&lt;/a&gt;.

Indeed, I can&#039;t predict when the next post in the series will be---but I don&#039;t want to make the articles less interesting.  In many of the articles I start by mentioning the last one, creating a back link to a previous post---and that back link appears in the comments on that previous post, so you can also use it as a &lt;i&gt;forwards&lt;/i&gt; link!  However, I see that &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2013/06/21/symmetry-and-the-fourth-dimension-part-11/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;part 11&lt;/a&gt; has no back link to this one.

In the long run I plan to take this series of blog posts and make it into a well-organized bunch of webpages on my website.  I&#039;ve already done this with other series of blog posts, like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;network theory&lt;/a&gt; series, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/information/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;information geometry&lt;/a&gt; series, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/rolling/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;rolling circles and balls&lt;/a&gt; series, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez//octonions/games/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;game theory&lt;/a&gt; series and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/octonions/integers/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;integral octonions&lt;/a&gt; series.  But I&#039;m a lazy bum, so I haven&#039;t gotten around to doing it with this one yet.

I will probably write some new posts in this series when my fall classes end in mid-December.  I&#039;ll be on sabbatical from January to June, so I&#039;ll have some more time for it then, though I also plan to finish up a bunch of papers and travel around Europe.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;They need a bit of help from a good website designer.&quot;

Heh.

I read this right after wishing, for the tenth time, that there were some easy way  to get from one of these &quot;Symmetry and the Fourth Dimension&quot; posts to its successor.

Most of the posts (all but the first?) have back links, but I&#039;m trying to read through the series, so after each one I have to Google for the next. Just recalling the URL and changing part-10 to part-11 won&#039;t get me there because the URL embeds the post date. 

This is a nuisance on my tablet. 

I suspect you can&#039;t predict when the next post in the series will be, since it&#039;s a blog and you are writing about other things, too. One alternative to going back and putting in forward-links is to make the articles less interesting, so we don&#039;t want to read the next ones.

Nice series. Thanks.]]></description>
