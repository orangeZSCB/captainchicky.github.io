I like that style though  its way above my pay grade.  I first saw a paper using path integral techniques in some collection of math biology papers (population genetics) by D Ludwig (1970&#039;s).  That was &#039;countertuitive&#039; to me because it transformed fokker-planck and diffusion equations into a sort of newtonian/hamilton jacobi formalism.  I had been told newtonian mechanics and stochastic processes were opposite processes.  Later i saw a paper (a PhD thesis) on population genetics by someone at U British columbia who also used dirac formalism (ladder operators&#039;).&#039;.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.5966   is on similar theme i think.]]></description>

Actually I somehow missed Arjun&#039;s correction of that typo---he&#039;s been posting lots of comments, and I&#039;m having trouble keeping up with them all.  (He&#039;s working with me here at the Centre for Quantum Technologies now.)  So, thanks a lot for posting your comment!  

The version on the arXiv is now a bit out of date.  The latest version, with all known corrections made, is &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/reaction.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;on my website&lt;/a&gt;.  But I&#039;ll eventually update the arXiv version.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I finally got around to reading paper.  I think I found a couple more minor typos:

In the proof of Lemma 12, I think $latex z^{k+\ell}$ should be $latex z^{m+\ell}$.  

In the penultimate sentence, &quot;...as show by...&quot; should be &quot;...as shown by...&quot;

Hope that helps.]]></description>

Cool!  I think the problems start with $latex N &#062; 1$ and the precise coefficients of operators like $latex a^\dagger_i a_j.$  You see, if we have such an operator that annihilates a &#039;nonexistent&#039; particle and creates an &#039;existent&#039; one, its matrix entries will depend on the number of nonexistent particles, since there are &lt;i&gt;different possibilities for which nonexistent particle is destroyed&lt;/i&gt;.  This is okay if there are a number of &#039;empty spots&#039; and we want to keep track of which one is filled by a new particle.  But in other situations, we may not get the answer we want.]]></description>

I think the $latex N = 1$ case has been looked at, after a fashion.  See N. Stollenwerk and M. Aguiar&#039;s &quot;The SIRI stochastic model with creation and annihilation operators&quot; [&lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.4565&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;arXiv:0806.4565&lt;/a&gt;].  They cook up a lattice model where each site can be in one of three states (Susceptible, Infected or Recovered), and to write a time-evolution operator, they bring in the Gell-Mann matrices.  I think this is pretty much a special case of what we were saying.  That is, their model has for each site

$latex S_i + R_i + I_i = 1, $

as indeed they say at the beginning of section 3.1.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It would be interesting to have some general results about, say, when coarse-graining a stochastic Petri net makes an equilibrium unviable, or makes a new equilibrium appear.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That sounds interesting but a bit tough.  Since I&#039;m pretty good at abstract nonsense, I&#039;d be tempted to start out by building some general infrastructure: namely, working out the correction notion(s) of &lt;i&gt;morphism&lt;/i&gt; between stochastic Petri nets, and figuring out how the rate equations and master equations are related, when we have two stochastic Petri nets related by a morphism.

Since a Petri net is a free symmetric monoidal category, one obvious notion of morphism, which you mentioned, is a symmetric monoidal functor.  (If we want to intimidate people, we can note that a category of &#039;free&#039; gadgets and the obvious morphisms between them is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleisli_category&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Kleisli category&lt;/a&gt;.  Knowing this can even be useful for things other than intimidation.)  

A stochastic Petri net is a free symmetric monoidal category equipped with a symmetric monoidal functor to the multiplicative monoid $latex (0,\infty)$, viewed as a symmetric monoidal category.  This again suggests an obvious notion of morphism between stochastic Petri nets, at least to us category geeks.

But the interesting part is whether these morphisms give rise to some sort of map sending solutions of the master equation of one stochastic Petri net to solutions of the other.  This would probably be &#039;too perfect&#039; for anyone interested in realistic coarse-grainings... but I suspect that if you follow the tao of mathematics, it will quickly lead you to consider these &#039;perfect&#039; coarse-grainings.]]></description>
