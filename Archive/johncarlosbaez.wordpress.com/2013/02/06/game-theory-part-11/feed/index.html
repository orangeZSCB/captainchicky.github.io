					<description><![CDATA[Professor Baez, 
well played!

On seeing the text in the picture 
my first move was to smile 
then move closer by zooming in. 

Payoff: 
The text drops away from focus and the face enters focus.

Previously, the writer of the text had been off-focus
when we focused on the text of the joke. Just an icon,
he was then just a &quot;type&quot; of thing as we focused on the joke.
In this situation of off-focus, he could not be identified
 as being a unique human being. He could be identified only 
as a type of human being.

But after the text is read, the reader&#039;s focus
then turns to the writer of the text.

This is a cool dude with a warm joke about the dark side 
of the Ultimatum Game.  Or as some might call it,
trickle-down theory.

His payoff from my moving up to this level of the game--&#062;

I want to hear his story. 

---&#062;

His move was to change his role in the game.

And by this, 
he changed the level of reality 
in the playing board.

What&#039;s a joke?

A game run amuck.

--&#062;

 You are excited to play, and you feel this inside.

So the game is afoot.

He is a human being and I am a human being.

In terms of situation theory, 
in the game situation his move was to metamorphose
from being a &quot;type&quot;--
a thing of which there may be instances--
into becoming a totally unique &quot;instance.&quot;

But,
an instance, in this case, of no type at all--

A totally unique human being.

Game over. 



Humanity wins. 

----&#062;

Professor Baez,

With climate disasters on-rushing, seems to me we need more games like this one-- 

Economic games where the winner is not the utility maximizer 
but humanity.]]></description>

I was going to use my mother in this example, but then I remembered about the beggar in San Francisco, so I switched to using my wife... but forgot to change all references to my mom!

Fixed.]]></description>
