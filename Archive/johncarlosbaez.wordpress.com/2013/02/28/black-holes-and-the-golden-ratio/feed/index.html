Wiki defines the golden ratio as a/b that solves the equation a/b = (a+b)/a  which gives 1.618 and -0.618. It comes from a simple geometrical expression so I&#039;d say this is the best definition.  Don&#039;t forget meters = i * c * seconds  (&quot;Relativity&quot; app 2 which allows Occam-required reduction from Minkowski space to Euclidean space) so don&#039;t throw away the negative in these considerations.]]></description>

Tweaking general relativity to avoid all its &#039;monstrous&#039; solutions seems a lot less interesting than seeing where it leads.  Cesar has already pointed out that the laws of black hole thermodynamics forbid gradually spinning up a black hole until it becomes extremal... just as we can&#039;t cool something all the way down to absolute zero.  If we&#039;d merely ruled out extremal black holes by fiat, we might never have learned this.]]></description>

I mainly chose the name Azimuth because it sounds cool and it doesn&#039;t have strong associations: most people can&#039;t remember what it means.  But it comes from from Arabic &lt;i&gt;as-sumut&lt;/i&gt; &quot;the ways,&quot; plural of &lt;i&gt;as-samt&lt;/i&gt; &quot;the way, direction&quot;. 

In Chinese, &quot;the way&quot; is famously translated as &lt;i&gt;tao&lt;/i&gt;.  Christian missionaries struggling to fit Chinese attitudes into their own monotheistic outlook liked to talk about &quot;The Tao&quot;.  But this is quite misleading, since in classical Chinese there&#039;s often no marker for singular and plural.   Instead of &lt;i&gt;tao&lt;/i&gt; meaning &quot;the one and only best way&quot;, it&#039;s simply &quot;way&quot;, or &quot;ways&quot; and there can be many ways.  So a phrase like &quot;the tao of scuba diving&quot; is not actually silly, at least not in Chinese: it just means the way to do scuba diving.  And there can be more than one.

I hope you understand what I&#039;m getting at here!  I&#039;m trying to encourage people to find a good way forward without claiming that we, the Azimuth gang, know or seek &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;the&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; way forward.]]></description>

John, as you point out Page work mainly with $latex J/M^2$, but the important thing to note is the fact that independently of the inital ratio, the Kerr always emits more angular momentum than mass and thus decays to a Schwarschild configuration in the abscence of accretion (which one should expect in a realistic environment). Regarding the &quot;canonical combination&quot;, it means 1 graviton, 1 photon, 3 neutrinos and the electron, the particles with known masses below $latex 20$ MeV (He was interested is some cosmological cenarios). So the fact that neutrinos are not really massles does not alter the discussion. Even if one is interested in large black holes where even the small neutrino mass would supress femionic radiation the vector and tensor fields would be enough to reproduce the behavior. As I commented above the only field which could in principle decrease the mass faster than angular momentum is the scalar field, as Page points out. 

As for the critical value where the decay is different, Page did not know at the time of the phase transition (presumably, as he did not mention it anywhere in the paper and the first Davies paper is from the following year). The point is that for large $latex a_\ast$ the vector and tensor fields dominate the radiaton, while for low values the spin $latex 1/2$ fields have the largest contribution to the mass and angular momentum change rate. This has nothing to do with the Davies transition at $latex \sqrt{2\sqrt{3}-3}=0.68$ as he derived it by looking at the coefficients plotted in table I for various values of $latex a_\ast$. Looking carefully one sees that the change in behavior occurs somewhere near $latex 0.55$ and certainly below $latex 0.60$. The specific heat $latex C_J$ does not play any role in Hawking radiation also, as this one always decreases angular momentum. It&#039;s importance is related to general Penrose Processes where no work is done. In fact despite being more than 30 years since this phase transition showed up no one has come with a physical relevance as far as I know, though that would be very interesting. There is even a lot a of controversie regarding the critical exponents of such transition, with a handfull of order parameters being suggested, but nothing seems very concrete.

To the best of my knowledge the only thing which seems agreeable is that since the divergence in $latex C_J$ is polynomial, and not logarithmic, than it implies that the critical exponent $latex \alpha\neq 0$ and thus this phase transition is not in the universality class of mean field theories, though I&#039;m not sure if that idea was further explored. But I think is a nice piece of knowledge we have on the mic]]></description>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In reply to <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2013/02/28/black-holes-and-the-golden-ratio/#comment-26399">John Baez</a>.</p>
<p>John, as you point out Page works mainly with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=J%2FM%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="J/M^2" class="latex" />, but the important thing to note is the fact that independently of the inital ratio, the Kerr always emits more angular momentum than mass and thus decays to a Schwarzschild configuration in the absence of accretion (which one should expect in a realistic environment). Regarding the &#8220;canonical combination&#8221;, it means 1 graviton, 1 photon, 3 neutrinos and the electron, the particles with known masses below <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=20&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="20" class="latex" /> MeV (He was interested is some cosmological scenarios). So the fact that neutrinos are not really massless does not alter the discussion. Even if one is interested in large black holes where even the small neutrino mass would suppress femionic radiation the vector and tensor fields would be enough to reproduce the behavior. As I commented above the only field which could in principle decrease the mass faster than angular momentum is the scalar field, as Page points out. </p>
<p>As for the critical value where the decay is different, Page did not know at the time of the phase transition (presumably, as he did not mention it anywhere in the paper and the first Davies paper is from the following year). The point is that for large <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_%5Cast&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a_&#92;ast" class="latex" /> the vector and tensor fields dominate the radiaton, while for low values the spin <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2F2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="1/2" class="latex" /> fields have the largest contribution to the mass and angular momentum change rate. This has nothing to do with the Davies transition at <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B2%5Csqrt%7B3%7D-3%7D%3D0.68&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;sqrt{2&#92;sqrt{3}-3}=0.68" class="latex" /> as he derived it by looking at the coefficients plotted in table I for various values of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_%5Cast&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a_&#92;ast" class="latex" />. Looking carefully one sees that the change in behavior occurs somewhere near <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0.55&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="0.55" class="latex" /> and certainly below <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0.60&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="0.60" class="latex" />. The specific heat <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_J&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C_J" class="latex" /> does not play any role in Hawking radiation also, as this one always decreases angular momentum. It&#8217;s importance is related to general Penrose processes where no work is done. In fact despite being more than 30 years since this phase transition showed up no one has come with a physical relevance as far as I know, though that would be very interesting. There is even a lot a of controversy regarding the critical exponents of such transition, with a handful of order parameters being suggested, but nothing seems very concrete.</p>
