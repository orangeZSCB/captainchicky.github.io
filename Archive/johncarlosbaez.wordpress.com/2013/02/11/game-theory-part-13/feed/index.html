					<description><![CDATA[In Part 13 we saw an example of a Nash equilibrium where both players use a mixed strategy.  This featured a zero-sum game. Now we’ll look at a modified version of this game. It will still be a zero-sum game. We’ll find a Nash equilibrium by finding each player’s ‘maximin strategy’. This technique works for zero-sum two-player normal-form games, but not most other games.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[But Professor Baez, without fake sincerity how would the advertising industry work, how would politics work? I once had the acquaintance of a super-salesman who said the real trick was (paraphrasing) to disconnect belief from knowledge. This was in the era of absurdly low quality cars. He concluded about his own success that he had the ability to believe what he knew was wrong. And as a result generate the sincerity required to sell absurdly low quality cars at a record pace! Generally in the economy sincerity of belief disconnected from knowledge might explain why consumers take on such absurd amounts of debt-- without which, our economy as it is cannot grow at its required rate. But to deal with the climate tragedies now at our doorstep, beliefs disconnected from knowledge-- no matter how sincere-- might be the biggest problem.]]></description>
