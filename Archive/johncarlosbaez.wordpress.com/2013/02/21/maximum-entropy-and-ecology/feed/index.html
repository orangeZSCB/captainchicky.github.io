We managed to get a video of Ostling&#039;s talk, but not Harte&#039;s.  Luckily, you can see the slides of both.  You can also see a summary of Harte&#039;s book &lt;i&gt;Maximum Entropy and Ecology&lt;/i&gt;:

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2013/02/21/maximum-entropy-and-ecology/#comment-28091&quot;&gt;linasv&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks, I&#039;ll look at that, and add it to this database:

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Extremal+principles+in+non-equilibrium+thermodynamics&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Extremal principles in non-equilibrium thermodynamics&lt;/a&gt;, Azimuth Wiki.

Over there you&#039;ll see a smart fellow nicknamed Tomate writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Funnily enough, there exists a “minimum entropy production principle” and a “maximum entropy production principle”. The apparent clash is due to the fact that while minimum entropy production is an ensemble property, that is, it holds on a macroscopic scale, the maximum entropy production principle is believed to hold for single trajectories, single “histories”. I think the first is well-established, indeed a classical result due to Prigogine, while the second is still speculative and sloppy; it is believed to have important ecological applications. Similarly, a similar confusion arises when one defines entropy as an ensemble property (Gibbs entropy) or else as a microstate property (Boltzmann entropy)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and also:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Let me explain my own take on the minEP vs. maxEP problem and on similar problems (such as Boltzmann vs. Gibbs entropy increase). It might help sorting out ideas.

By “state” we mean very different things in NESM, among which: 1) the (micro)state which a single history of a system occupies at given times 2) the trajectory itself 3) the density of microstates which an ensemble of a large number of trajectories occupies at a given time (a macrostate). One can define entropy production at all levels of discussion (for the mathematically-inclined, markovian master equation systems offer the best set up where all is nice and defined). So, for example, the famous “fluctuation theorem” is a statement about microscopic entropy production along a trajectory, while the Onsager’s reciprocity relations are a statement about macroscopic entropy production. By “steady state”, we mean a stationary macrostate.

The minEP principle asserts that the distribution of macroscopic currents at a nonequilibrium steady state minimizes entropy production consistently with the constraints which prevent the system from reaching equilibrium.

As I understand it, maxEP is instead a property of single trajectories: most probable trajectories are those which have a maximum entropy production rate, consistently with constraints.

As a climate scientist, you should be interested in the second as we have not an ensemble of planets among which to maximize entropy or minimize entropy production. We have one single realization of the process, and we’d better make good use of it.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I have not yet gotten around to really understanding these remarks.  I really want to understand them.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[FYI, There was some recent hubbub about a PRL from Wissner-Gross   He suggests maximizing the &quot;causal entropy&quot;, defined as entropy over a set of paths.  I&#039;ve got this vague impression that perhaps this might resolve some of the contradictory issues with MEP principles: any one single path is minimizing (e.g. minimizing the action) but the ensemble of all paths maximize the (causal) entropy. In his words, systems move to a state that maximizes the causal access to the largest number of possible future states.

and it splattered on the popular press:

It is correct that Harte is not allowing for disconnected regions in this context. Disconnected cells would affect the implicit spatial autocorrelation that is present in the solution. I asked him about this because it would of course make testing easier if we could use disconnected data, but sadly no.]]></description>

Yes the Poisson is one of the natural distributions that emerges from MaxEnt in this context and it is (as in most modeling approaches) fairly common for the details of the way in which you setup up the problem to influence the outcome. However, the changes that can be seen from what appear to be small differences in setup in MaxEnt can sometimes be substantial. For a good description of this in the context of the spatial predictions of Harte et al.&#039;s theory I recommend &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/650718&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Haegeman and Etienne 2010&lt;/a&gt;]]></description>

Yeah, I wasn&#039;t really expressing any doubt about the physical collection, just about possible &quot;unconscious preknowledge bias&quot;. I&#039;m just a bit hard on this point where people try to do something using pure statistics on existing data only. One of the pluses, and also soul-crushing minuses, of doing some of my work on computer performance is that &quot;new&quot; experiments are really quite easy to do. It&#039;s amazing how often I can persuade myself that some gathered data is really, amazingly well-explained by some simple model, code up a new experiment that I&#039;m sure I know will prove my point and then find out that at best reality is more complex than my model and at worst my model is wrong.

My experience is that it&#039;s much more reliable if when you&#039;re restricted to existing data your model is motivated by some &quot;physical&quot; reasoning, or if it&#039;s purely statistical you&#039;re validating by looking at never-seen data.

It&#039;d be interesting if Harte&#039;s work is well supported; I&#039;ll have to try to dig out more work and read up on it.]]></description>

Good point.  Nonetheless the whole theory still makes sense if we explicitly say we&#039;re restricting attention to, say, vertebrates, or any other chosen collection of organisms that we have the ability to catalogue.  And then we can test it.]]></description>

There is also the issue of microorganisms, both procaryotic (bacteria, archea) and eucaryotic (protists, fungi, etc). There are probably many thousands if not millions of bacterial species alone in the 10.24-hectare patch of tropical forest (plus the whole concept of a species is pretty ill-defined in this case.)]]></description>
