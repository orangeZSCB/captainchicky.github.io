There is a hierarchy of effects which you are not admitting here. Sure, at smaller levels of influence, there is a lot not known about the workings of the climate system and the geophysics of it all. However, the basic science is known, and it is incredibly unlikely the major influences would be overturned without some corresponding basic change in the understanding of the physics. Basic physics cannot be subjected to a hypothesis test. Basic physics provides a powerful and fundamental prior distribution which data and likelihood functions must be really compelling to overturn.

Indeed, the physics is so powerful, there is no need for &quot;confirmatory evidence&quot;.  In fact, climate change HAS to happen if the physics are correct. 

The statistics and non-linearities of turbulence associated with energy distribution cannot magically overcome basic thermodynamics and the physics of blackbody radiation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In my opinion, as a natural scientist myself, climate science fails to be a science at all, because of one single reason: the inability to admit the complexity of the topic (every week there are new &quot;unexpected&quot; findings regarding important details with a major impact on all existing theories) and the ignorance of everything not fitting into the predictions. In other words...everything that is observed is interpreted as a sign for global warming...if it gets hotter, well, of course, global warming...but if it remains cooler than expected for more than a decade, well, of course, also global warming...thus, with a little change in the argument, everything is fine again. But this clearly is rather ideologic than scientific. And it is not the usual way, scientific results emerge and are discussed!]]></description>

I am thinking that the perfect shape of a wing can be obtained with a optimal triangulation: each side of the mesh is a electromechanical actuator.
The wing mesh is covered with a elastic surface.
If this work, than the wind turbine plant can replace coal extraction.

I am thinking to an optimal wing, for airplane and wind turbine, so that there is a friction (and energy loss) reduction.
I am thinking to a N-transversal section of the wing (with a thickening in the end), with N two ball joints, so that each section can change the wing shape; each region, on the Earth, have a measured wind velocity, so that it is possible to try the maximization of the power production for the local wind speeds

					<description><![CDATA[Is it possible a global energetic optimization to reduce global pollution?
Is it possible the optimization of the propellers for large vessels with evolution strategy?
It is possible the optimization of the electronic control unit for cars during the evaluation testing: if the parameter of the engine operation (the intake valve times,electrical time spark, ...) have a little random change during the test driving, then the minimum fuel consumption is the right parameters value; so it is possible the optimization of all the new cars (many cars, many energy reduction).
It is possible optimize, in general, each human mechanism, so as to reduce consumption (energy,petroleum,coal,etc.); for example the hull shapes, electronic circuit (serial-parallel variable elements instead of a constant element?), water impulse turbine, steam turbine (change of the vane angles and dimension?).
Is it possible a material optimization (with evolution strategy) using a random change of the element of the alloy?
Is it possible to optimize solar cell composition with brickyard-robot that change contiuously the doping impurities and structure?

					<description><![CDATA[It is possible an optimization of the wind generators, to obtain lower cost of the energy (to substitute coal).

The energy loss is due to turbulence for the not optimal blade form.
It is possible a great increase of the efficiency using genetic algorithmic 
applied to the reality.

You imagine thousand electromechanical actuators that change the geometric shape of blades in a wind tunnel (with constant wind velocity) to increase the power production (the error function): it is not necessary a numerical simulation of the wind generator, it is only necessary a power measure for each little random change of the real shape, and store the optimal shape.

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2013/02/05/successful-predictions-of-climate-science/#comment-25436&quot;&gt;Marco&lt;/a&gt;.

@Marco Re. the U.K. Met Office

The problem involves two different sets of historical data from two respected agencies: the UK Met Office and America&#039;s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). 

There are rules that scientists must follow in order for their work to be judged valid. The work must be done openly, transparently—there can be no secret steps or hidden incantations. This is because the work must be reproducible, not just by those who originated it but by outsiders as well. Things began going off the rails when NOAA recently reprocessed the SSU temperatures and published the full processing methodology and the resulting data in the peer-reviewed literature. This is as it should be, NOAA followed the rules. But it soon became obvious that there were grave discrepancies between the new NOAA data and the older Met Office data....

“The methodology used to generate the original Met Office SSU data remains undocumented and so the climate community are unable to explain the large discrepancies between the original Met Office and NOAA SSU products highlighted here,” Thompson et al. summarize. And the damage doesn&#039;t stop there.

The data from the erroneous dataset has been used widely to help drive and define computer climate models, the same models used to prop-up alarmist claims of impending catastrophic climate change.

Those are excerpts from this troubling 1/15/2013 report:

http://theresilientearth.com/?q=content/science-gets-stratosphere-wrong

which in turn is based on this report in the 29 November 2012 issue of Nature

“The mystery of recent stratospheric temperature trends”

http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v491/n7426/full/nature11579.html

Those are the facts. Continuing in the first troubling report is this commentary I have excerpted:

The methodology used to develop the Met Office SSU product was never published in the peer-reviewed literature, and certain aspects of the original processing “remain unknown.”

The bottom line here is that models based on this almost universally accepted data are wrong. “If the NOAA SSU data are correct, then both the CCMVal2 and CMIP5 models are presumably missing key changes in stratospheric composition,” the report plainly states. The article goes on to suggest corrective actions to prevent such a travesty being repeated in the future. Alas, the damage has already been done.

How other climate scientists blindly accepted the Met Office&#039;s manufactured data, even when their models could not be reconciled with nature, leads one to question the scientific integrity of many of those in the field. This is not acceptable behavior in any realm of scientific endeavor, and when the results of research are used to inflame the public and drive questionable socioeconomic programs the malfeasance could be considered criminal. This is what happens when the race for fame, government funding and political advantage collide with science—the validity of the science is destroyed.]]></description>
