Note that an important point is that in most real games you&#039;re not starting from just some ordered deck of cards, but because of patterns of play in the previous game (hands of whist, games of poker, etc, depending on the game) &quot;high value&quot; cards will be clustered together. This tends to mean that if there are also imperfections in the rifling they&#039;re less likely to be separated and then the tend to get redistributed fairly evenly by a &quot;rotating round the table&quot; deal. So real shuffles+dealings tend to be more &quot;balanced&quot; than genuinely random selections, which have more very good and very bad hands.]]></description>

Sorry, I&#039;m a showoff... but I only learned this Cool Maths of Shuffling by checking out your reference and finding that paper by Diaconis on perfect shuffles.  And I got so excited by this new appearance of the Mathieu group $latex M_{12}$ that I posted &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.google.com/u/0/117663015413546257905/posts/GzFWUkg3aot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;!  So thanks.]]></description>

Cool!  These are &#039;perfect&#039; shuffles, where you interleave the cards in a perfectly alternating way.  And yet again, Diaconis seems to be behind this result:

&#8226; Persi Diaconis, Ronald Graham and William M. Kantor, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~cgates/PERSI/papers/83_05_shuffles.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The mathematics of perfect shuffles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Advances in Applied Mathematics&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; (1983), 175–196.

There are two kinds of perfect shuffles: &lt;b&gt;out&lt;/b&gt; shuffles, where the top card stays on top, and &lt;b&gt;in&lt;/b&gt; shuffles, where it doesn&#039;t.  Here&#039;s a wacky result from this paper: you have a deck of 24 cards, the group of permutations generated by in and out shuffles is the semidirect product of $latex (\mathbb{Z}/2)^{11}$ and the Mathieu group $latex M_{12}.$  

This Mathieu group is an amazing group with 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 = 95,040 elements.  It acts in a &lt;b&gt;sharply quintuply transitive&lt;/b&gt; way on a 12-element set, meaning that you can take any 5-tuple of distinct elements of that set and find a unique element of the group that maps it to any other 5-tuple of distinct elements!  Apart from symmetric and alternating groups, there are only a few groups that are k-tuply transitive for k &#062; 3, so this group is very special.  This group is also &#039;simple&#039;, meaning that it doesn&#039;t have any nontrivial normal subgroups.  There&#039;s also a &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week20.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;cool description&lt;/a&gt; of this group in terms of 12 balls rolling on a ball of the same size!

Ronald Graham is the guy that Graham&#039;s number is named after.  Diaconis and Graham won a writing prize at the Joint Mathematics Meetings in San Diego this January.  Upon accepting the prize they played a card trick.  I later asked Graham about the somewhat mysterious story behind Graham&#039;s number, and he &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.google.com/u/0/117663015413546257905/posts/KJTgfjkTZCQ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;clarified it&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>

8 riffle shuffles may not shuffle at all.

There&#039;s been a lot of research on this, with Persi Diaconis playing a leading role.  Here&#039;s a good quick overview with references:

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuffling_playing_cards#Research&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Shuffling playing cards - research&lt;/a&gt;, Wikipedia.

A rough rule of thumb is &#039;7 riffle shuffles are enough&#039;.  But the details are complex and fascinating.]]></description>
