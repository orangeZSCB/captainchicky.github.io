Ugh, we&#039;d have to rewrite the whole book.  

There&#039;s no serious ambiguity, I think, since the target is always the target of some reaction, like $latex t(\tau),$ while time always appears inside a function, like $latex x(t)$ or $latex \psi(t).$]]></description>

Unfortunately the full definition of &#039;coherent&#039; state relies on lots of notation that&#039;s brought in only after the introduction.  But I added a quick rough definition of coherent state to the intro... and since someone had gotten fooled into thinking Arjun was talking about quantum mechanics, I clarified that too:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Remember, the &#039;master equation&#039; describes the random evolution of collections of classical particles, and a &#039;coherent state&#039; is one where the probability distribution of particles of each type is a Poisson distribution.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

Howard wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I don&#039;t know which case &quot;this case&quot; is: quantum or stochastic.  

In the stochastic case, a coherent state for one type of particle looks like

$latex \displaystyle{ \Psi = \frac{\exp(cz)}{\exp(c)} = e^{-c} \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{c^n}{n!}  }$

so the probability of having $latex n$ particles of this type is given by the $latex n$th coefficient of this series:

$latex \displaystyle{ e^{-c} \, \frac{c^{n}}{n!} } $

which is a Poisson distribution.   Here we need $latex c &#062; 0.$

I guess in the quantum case you get a Poisson distribution too, since while you have to take the absolute value squared of an amplitude to get a probability, you also need to use the coefficients with respect to the orthonormal basis $latex z^n/\sqrt{n!},$ instead of with respect to the basis $latex z^n$ as in stochastic mechanics.  So, you get amplitudes

$latex \displaystyle{ e^{-c} \, \frac{c^{n}}{\sqrt{n!}} } $

and probabilities

$latex  \displaystyle{ e^{-2c} \, \frac{c^{2n}}{n!} } $

at least when $latex c$ is real.  So, again a Poisson distribution.  (I&#039;m too lazy to think about the case of complex $latex c$ right this instant.)]]></description>

Well I&#039;ll shut up then! :-)  The problem description certainly makes a lot more sense for classical master equations. In my defence, I presume that here &quot;annihilation operators&quot;,  &quot;Hamiltonians&quot; and &quot;coherent states&quot; (not to mention $latex \psi $) are all borrowed from QM in a deliberate attempt to confuse physicists ;-)  But these coherent states don&#039;t correspond to Poissonian distributions in this case, do they?

Arjun is discussing stochastic mechanics, not quantum mechanics.  For the difference, read &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/networks_12.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Part 12&lt;/a&gt; of the network theory series on this blog, or for more detail my &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/stoch_stable.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; on the subject.  

Briefly: $latex \Psi$ represents a probability distribution, not a wavefunction.  Time evolution operators should thus preserve 

$latex \sum_\ell \psi_\ell $

not 

$latex \sum_\ell &#124;\psi_\ell&#124;^2$

We thus say these operators are &#039;stochastic&#039; rather than unitary.  The Hamiltonian $latex H$ must therefore be &#039;infinitesimal stochastic&#039;, not skew-adjoint.  There is also no $latex i$ in the master equation, which otherwise looks formally like Schr&#246;dinger&#039;s equation.]]></description>

Graham wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I am not a physicist, and I only have a vague idea about what coherence is. It sounds like a property I have met in probability theory but maybe the resemblance is superficial.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the context of quantum physics, a typical coherent state is the state of photons in a laser beam.  But in the current context, a coherent state is just another name for a product of independent Poisson distributions!  It just so happens that the math is very similar.

Arjun is studying reaction networks, which describe random reaction processes involving random assortments of molecules of different kinds.  At any moment there&#039;s some probability $latex p(n_1, \dots, n_k)$ of having $latex n_i$ molecules of the $latex i$th kind.  When this is a product of independent Poisson distributions, one for each kind of molecule, we call that a &lt;b&gt;coherent state&lt;/b&gt;.

If you start with a coherent state, will it stay coherent?  Sometimes, but not often.

The Anderson-Craciun-Kurtz theorem says that for a large class of reaction networks, there are lots of &lt;i&gt;equilibrium&lt;/i&gt; states that are products of independent Poisson distributions.  This is quite an amazing theorem, given how complicated the reactions can be.  This gives one source of examples.

Another source of examples consists of reaction networks where each reaction has just one molecule as input and one molecule as output.  These examples are a bit atypical in chemistry... but mathematically they give interesting examples, because for these, &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; state that&#039;s initially a product of Poisson distributions will always evolve to other such states. 

Arjun put severe limits on what other kinds of examples we can have.

I&#039;ll write another comment addressing your actual idea... when I&#039;m feeling a bit more peppy and intelligent.]]></description>

<p>In the context of quantum physics, a typical coherent state is the state of photons in a laser beam.  But in the current context, a coherent state is just another name for a product of independent Poisson distributions!  It just so happens that the math is very similar.</p>
<p>Arjun is studying reaction networks, which describe random reaction processes involving random assortments of molecules of different kinds.  At any moment there&#8217;s some probability <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%28n_1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+n_k%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p(n_1, &#92;dots, n_k)" class="latex" /> of having <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n_i" class="latex" /> molecules of the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i" class="latex" />th kind.  When this is a product of independent Poisson distributions, one for each kind of molecule, we call that a <b>coherent state</b>.</p>
<p>If you start with a coherent state, will it stay coherent?  Sometimes, but not often.</p>
<p>The Anderson-Craciun-Kurtz theorem says that for a large class of reaction networks, there are lots of <i>equilibrium</i> states that are products of independent Poisson distributions.  This is quite an amazing theorem, given how complicated the reactions can be.  This gives one source of examples.</p>
<p>Another source of examples consists of reaction networks where each reaction has just one molecule as input and one molecule as output.  These examples are a bit atypical in chemistry&#8230; but mathematically they give interesting examples, because for these, <i>any</i> state that&#8217;s initially a product of Poisson distributions will always evolve to other such states. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[I am not a physicist, and I only have a vague idea about what coherence is. It sounds like a property I have met in probability theory but maybe the resemblance is superficial.

An example is the Chinese restaurant process, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_restaurant_process. This gives a family of distributions $latex P_n$ on partitions of $latex \{1,2,\dots,n\}$ for any positive integer $latex n$. A customer arriving is like a creation operator, going from $latex P_n$ to $latex P_{n+1}$, and (randomly chosen)  customer leaving is like an annihilation operator. (I&#039;m pretty sure these are inverses of one another.) Does this mean we can make a Hamiltonian which acts on partitions?

Other examples are  family of distributions  on binary trees. (eg Aldous, D. 1996. Probability distributions on cladograms, http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~ponty/enseignement/BIBS09articles/Aldous-Cladograms-1996.pdf, Ford, D. 2005. Probabilities on cladogram: Introduction to the alpha model, http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0511246.pdf.) These can have a property called &#039;sampling consistency&#039; or &#039;deletion stability&#039; meaning that randomly removing a tip from a tree leaves you in the same family of distributions.]]></description>
