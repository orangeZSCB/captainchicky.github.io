One more point: once you have a distribution system based on each individual&#039;s decisions about what interests them (as opposed to a central point of control), then you should provide measures of &quot;prestige&quot; / &quot;cool factor&quot; that simply reflect all those individual decisions and assessments.  In other words, the *actual impact* of a paper, measured across the whole community, instead of the *predicted impact* assigned by fiat of the central point of control.]]></description>

The ambiguity of words like &quot;prestige&quot; and &quot;cool factor&quot; is tripping us up here...  So let me clarify what I was saying:

* in my view nothing should get in the way of each individual deciding for himself what interests him, and whose work he wants to hear about.  In particular, each person should speak for themselves alone and for no one else; there should be no central point of control that decides what the community should read.  So if &quot;cool&quot; means what personally interests you, then I&#039;m all for it; if it means what makes a Nature editor dream of press releases, then I&#039;m against it (as a principle for how to run the distribution network).  

The job of the research distribution system should be that of a search engine (i.e. enabling each individual to find what they individually want, and thus to hook up with other individuals with the same interests) not that of a TV network (to find a lowest common denominator &quot;script&quot; for the biggest possible audience).

* The selectedpapers.net approach definitely intends a crucial role for people who are willing to exit the current &quot;bean counting&quot; system.  Specifically our &quot;public data federation&quot; open model seeks to provide them the maximum leverage possible, by ensuring that whatever they write can be visible across all the social networks, instead of being trapped within a single site as in the walled garden model.]]></description>

I should add that while there are lots of problems with academia, I can&#039;t imagine any other job where I could have the same freedom to do cool stuff.  I have never worried much about bean-counting aspects, and I&#039;ve done just fine.  So for me, at least, it&#039;s an institution that I want to improve rather than toss out.

Luckily we don&#039;t need to settle questions about the fate of academia to agree on some ways to improve communication, like the spnetwork.  If one tries to settle too many big questions at once, different people come up with different answers, the community of concerned people splinters, and the number of people working on any one given solution diminishes.]]></description>

Re: John Iskra, I agree. The &quot;exile&quot; is happening already, there are lots of talents who left or never considered to enter  academia, sadly. The reponsibility is on the side of academic managers, hiding from responsibility behind numbers. There is no rule governing humans, other than belief, i.e. if more people believe it&#039;s broken, then at some point there will be a change. Universities were places for training priests, then they changed,  under the pressure coming from the spreading of the press, into places where research is welcomed. Now, they are treated as busineses, so they lose their cool factor. Next generation? Eff it! In the bean counting parallel reality things look great.]]></description>

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There were very few academic jobs in Gauss&#039; day compared to now, because university education was only for an elite few.  Jobs were handed out using the &quot;good old boys&quot; system: the people doing the hiring would typically know the job candidates personally.  Things were more localized: often the job candidates would have studied at the universities they later went on to work in, and almost always they would come from the same country.  

None of these conditions are true in academia today, especially not in the US, which gets many of its best students and professors from other countries.  In the US, the big shift happened after World War II, when higher education was extended to more people and federal funding for science grew immensely.  

A typical math job at my university will get several hundred applicants from countries all around the world, and there are laws requiring us to give all applicants fair consideration.   Hires have to be okayed by several layers of bureaucracy beyond the department.  

Tenure and promotions also go through several layers of bureaucracy, including &#039;ad hoc committees&#039; composed of faculty from various departments.   So, it&#039;s not enough for us to know that a mathematician is good: we need to convince people from outside our department that this is true.  Saying someone has classified all Calabi-Yau manifolds would not be enough, even though to a mathematician this would be the equivalent of walking on water.   

In general, if people from any given academic department can&#039;t convince outsiders who know nothing about that subject that they&#039;re doing great things, they&#039;ll eventually decide that department is weak and give it fewer positions and less money.   This is where bean-counting becomes extremely important, and dangerous.  

Prestige was just as important in Gauss&#039; day, and the system was just as flawed as it is now.  It just worked quite differently.]]></description>

Sorry, you misunderstood me: I was simply describing the system as it exists today, not advocating that it should be retained in its current form.  I was arguing that the current reality is that most people are constrained to the current system by other people (hiring committees, grant committees) adhering to the &quot;prestige&quot; measures of the current system.  And I was arguing that we must therefore break those measures (&quot;pre-evaluation&quot;) and replace them with something better (&quot;post-evaluation&quot;).  So you and I are in agreement about goals.  And I fully agree about striking while the iron is hot.

So let me ask you: are you willing to submit your next paper to a new peer review process and journal (backed by the big names you mentioned) that follow the &quot;openness&quot; principles you have in mind?  By virtue of being new, it of course won&#039;t (yet) have as much reputation as the established journals.  Are you willing to make that small sacrifice in initial &quot;prestige&quot;, to leave the walled garden and help build the open system?

Thinking about what you said, I think for me the answer is YES.]]></description>

It&#039;s only exile if no one else joins you. 

I agree with chora:  Trying to change this system, but conceding that there is such a thing as prestige and that hiring committees cannot ascertain it, is like saying you&#039;d like to eliminate global warming, but conceding that we can&#039;t do anything about people&#039;s need to use fossil fuels at increasing levels.  Prestige and its pursuit is exactly the leverage that the publishers use to maintain this crooked system.  
There were academic jobs back in Gauss&#039; day - even before that.  How did people get them?  How did they keep them?  How did people acquire a reputation for good work back then?  And how might we do that today?  I think the answers are roughly the same now as they were then.  
Anyway, there&#039;s a lot of dissatisfaction out there.  The iron should be struck while it is still hot.  We have big names willing to go off to &#039;exile&#039;.  We may never have a better chance to leave the world of walled gardens.]]></description>

I fully agree that people need metrics for evaluating validity and impact.  But bear in mind that the current metric for the &quot;value&quot; of a paper (&quot;Name of the journal it was published in&quot;, AKA &quot;impact factor&quot;) is ridiculous in multiple ways:
* the metric for evaluating a paper should be measured for the *paper*, not the journal (obvious: the variation in citation counts for papers within one journal is as wide as the differences in impact factor between journals);
* the current metric is locked in at the moment the journal accepts the paper, i.e. before everybody has had a chance to even read it, let alone evaluate its claims.  I refer to this as the &quot;pre-evaluation&quot; principle.  Unfortunately many studies have shown that pre-evaluation works badly.  For example, pharmaceutical companies try rigorously to reproduce academic studies relevant to disease or drug discovery.  Unfortunately, in 80% of cases they find that the reported experimental results (using the exact same reagents and protocols) are not reproducible.  And those are for papers published in the *most* selective journals (Nature, Science etc.)  The bottom line is that pre-evaluation (before anyone has had a chance to test the claims) is the worst time to lock in the paper&#039;s &quot;value&quot; metric.  Far better would be to let the community read the paper first, discuss its claims, and test them.  I call that &quot;post-evaluation&quot;.  We need to move from pre-evaluation metrics to post-evaluation metrics  -- and that is perfectly feasible in the Internet era.  Science is complicated, and in many fields it&#039;s just very hard to assess which claims will turn out to pass the test of time (without anybody actually trying to reproduce them), let alone to predict which will turn out to be important (high impact) in the long run.  The field is littered with examples of both false positives and false negatives caused by pre-evaluation&#039;s errors.

I could go on with lots more critiques of the current metric, but you get the idea.  What we need is rigorous research on scientometrics.]]></description>

For example, pharmaceutical companies try rigorously to reproduce academic studies relevant to disease or drug discovery.  Unfortunately, in 80% of cases they find that the reported experimental results (using the exact same reagents and protocols) are not reproducible.  And those are for papers published in the *most* selective journals (Nature, Science etc.)  The bottom line is that pre-evaluation (before anyone has had a chance to test the claims) is the worst time to lock in the paper&#8217;s &#8220;value&#8221; metric.  Far better would be to let the community read the paper first, discuss its claims, and test them.  I call that &#8220;post-evaluation&#8221;.  We need to move from pre-evaluation metrics to post-evaluation metrics  &#8212; and that is perfectly feasible in the Internet era.  Science is complicated, and in many fields it&#8217;s just very hard to assess which claims will turn out to pass the test of time (without anybody actually trying to reproduce them), let alone to predict which will turn out to be important (high impact) in the long run.  The field is littered with examples of both false positives and false negatives caused by pre-evaluation&#8217;s errors.</p>
<p>I could go on with lots more critiques of the current metric, but you get the idea.  What we need is rigorous research on scientometrics.</p>

Note I wasn&#039;t saying &quot;everything was good in the old system&quot;, but rather that it had one key advantage we need to learn from: because it had no point a third-party could control, it was not a walled garden.  That is highly relevant, because the root of all our problems is the walled garden.]]></description>
