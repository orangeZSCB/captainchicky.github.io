I&#039;m glad you&#039;re enjoying my attempts... 

I have a few reasons for rescaling the annihilation and creation operators the way I did.  First, as you mention, it&#039;s nice to retain the property that hitting a normalized state with a creation operator gives a normalized state.  Second, the master equation seems to look simpler in terms of rescaled annihilation and creation operators if we do what I did, instead of the more symmetrical-looking

$latex A_i = \sqrt{\hbar} a_i$
$latex C_i = \sqrt{\hbar} a_i^\dagger$

Third, some things about coherent states seem to work better.  

But I&#039;ll have to keep doing calculations to know for sure what&#039;s the best setup.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2013/07/01/the-large-number-limit-for-reaction-networks-part-1/#comment-31316&quot;&gt;domenico&lt;/a&gt;.

If we want to keep the symmetry we can use

$latex A_i = \sqrt{\hbar} a_i$
$latex C_i = \sqrt{\hbar} a_i^\dagger$

If I were wanting to build self-adjoint Hamiltonians I would probably want to do this, since then $latex C_i = A_i^\dagger$ and it&#039;s easy to tell which combinations of $latex A_i$ and $latex C_i$ are self-adjoint.

But in stochastic mechanics we want infinitesimal stochastic Hamiltonians, with 

$latex \langle H \Psi \rangle  = 0 $

for all $latex \Psi,$ using my usual definition of the angle bracket:

$latex \displaystyle{\langle \Phi \rangle = \sum_{\ell \in \mathbb{N}^k} \phi_\ell } $

for 

$latex \displaystyle{ \Phi = \sum_{\ell \in \mathbb{N}^k} \phi_\ell z^\ell }$

In this situation it&#039;s very nice that the creation operators obey a simple rule:

$latex \langle a_i^\dagger \Psi \rangle = \langle \Psi \rangle$

which implies

$latex \langle a_i \Psi \rangle = \langle N_i \Psi \rangle$

I have chosen my rescaled annihilation, creation and number operators

$latex A_i = \hbar a_i$
$latex C_i =  a_i^\dagger$
$latex \widetilde{N}_i = C_i A_i$

so they still obey these rules:

$latex \langle C_i \Psi \rangle = \langle \Psi \rangle$

which implies

$latex \langle A_i \Psi \rangle = \langle \widetilde{N}_i \Psi \rangle$

along with simple commutation relations.

Using powers of annihilation and creation operators makes things very complicated, and I don&#039;t think it fits the idea of &#039;rescaling&#039; that&#039;s built into the classical limit.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It is all elegant, beautiful and thorough.

I don&#039;t like only the loss of the symmetry in the $latex A_i$ and $latex C_i$ operator definition.

I am thinking that the classical limit can be obtained using a product of creation, or annihilation:
$latex A_i = (a{\dagger}_i)^n $
and
$latex C_i = (a_i)^n $
in the limit of great n, could be possible that is obtained the classical limit? Or the Poisson bracket?
The operator number is:
$latex N_i = (a^{\dagger}_i)^n (a_i)^n $
but the commutation rules are very complex.]]></description>

<p>I don&#8217;t like only the loss of the symmetry in the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A_i" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C_i" class="latex" /> operator definition.</p>
<p>I am thinking that the classical limit can be obtained using a product of creation, or annihilation:<br />
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A_i+%3D+%28a%7B%5Cdagger%7D_i%29%5En+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A_i = (a{&#92;dagger}_i)^n " class="latex" /><br />
and<br />
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_i+%3D+%28a_i%29%5En+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C_i = (a_i)^n " class="latex" /><br />
in the limit of great n, could be possible that is obtained the classical limit? Or the Poisson bracket?<br />
The operator number is:<br />
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N_i+%3D+%28a%5E%7B%5Cdagger%7D_i%29%5En+%28a_i%29%5En+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="N_i = (a^{&#92;dagger}_i)^n (a_i)^n " class="latex" /><br />
but the commutation rules are very complex.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Interesting.  Following is some off-the-cuff intuition on why one might want to scale the annihilation operator but not the creation operator.  It may be way out there, but I just thought I&#039;d run it by you.  Anyway, here goes:

For pure states, we have that $latex a^{\dagger m} z^\ell = z^{\ell + m}$ so that the creation operator maps pure states to pure states (i.e., in this case from a state having probability one of having $latex m$ things to one having probability one of having $latex \ell + m$ things).  However, the annihilation operator satisfies $latex a^m z^\ell =\ell^{\underline{m}} z^{\ell - m}$ so it typically maps a pure state to a non-normalized state (i.e., the coefficient is typically greater than one).  So, it makes sense to rescale the annihilation operator by the inverse of the &quot;expected&quot; maximum &quot;system size.&quot;  Then, both operators will typically map pure states to pure states (and hence mixed states to mixed states), as long as the number of things being annihilated at any given time is less than $latex 1/\hbar$.  If we want the possibility of an infinite &quot;system size,&quot; then we should take the limit $latex \hbar\rightarrow 0$.

At any rate, whether that makes any sense or not, I am looking forward to the next post on this to see where you&#039;re going with it.]]></description>

I so often set $latex \hbar = 1$ in my thinking on quantum mechanics that I don&#039;t know whether the &#039;usual&#039; commutator of annihilation and creation operators is 1 or $latex \hbar.$  

But I know that to get Poisson brackets in the classical limit I need a bunch of quantities whose commutators are proportional to $latex \hbar$ (perhaps plus higher-order corrections).  

We could define quantities $latex p$ and $latex q$ as linear combinations of $latex a$ and $latex a^\dagger$, and work with those.   However, in the stochastic context I don&#039;t know what those quantities mean!  Since the Hamiltonian for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/networks_8.html#master_equation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;master equation&lt;/a&gt; is built using creation and annihilation operators, and my goal is to study the large-number limit of the master equation, I&#039;d rather work with those.

It&#039;s a bit bizarre that we don&#039;t know what $latex p$ and $latex q$ mean in the stochastic context!  This is something I should correct sometime... I think I can sense yet another shoe dropping!

However, at present I have no understanding of these quantities in stochastic mechanics, and I have another goal in mind, so I&#039;ll postpone thinking about them for a while.  Thanks for reminding me to do it someday.]]></description>

Also, your definition of A and C on $latex \psi$ reminds me more of the use of x and p in QM. In that case, it would be natural to multiply p times $latex \hbar$, since it&#039;s how it&#039;s defined in usual QM. However, you lose $latex N = a^*a$, which I suppose it was the reason you defined them like that.]]></description>
