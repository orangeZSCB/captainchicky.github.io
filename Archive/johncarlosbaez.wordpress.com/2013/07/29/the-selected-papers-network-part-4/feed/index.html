I held off inviting anyone from biology for a very specific reason: the PubMed backend (eutils) was behaving very flaky in my testing (seemed like our searches were being blocked).  PubMed is the main search engine for the biomedical literature, and I didn&#039;t want to expose biology users to a bad user experience.  I&#039;ve talked with the eutils people at PubMed and they assured me our user searches won&#039;t be blocked.  So I agree it&#039;s time to start inviting people from those disciplines.

Could you say a bit more about the open notebook concept, how you&#039;re trying it in WordPress, and how you&#039;d want the spnet to integrate it?  I&#039;m very interested!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good luck with the spnetwork! In order to people come to it, it needs a fun reason. From my POV, I&#039;d be very attracted to the idea of  enlarging the notion of &quot;article&quot; besides arxiv, for example by providing a search possibility in open notebooks (very fond of that concept, I&#039;m actively trying it on wordpress). I don&#039;t know  how to do that but I&#039;m thinking about Phillip Lord efforts towards publications in blogs, for example. 
As a second thought, the spnetwork might grow faster if other fields, like biology or neuroscience, join the party. Then, what a trill to see truly interdisciplinary bunches of comments, on spnetwork!]]></description>

My remark about faking sincerity was just joking around, and probably not in good taste.  I do however think that any successful attempt to do what you want will create some new winners and new losers.  I&#039;m perfectly happy with that.  By doing it right, there will be more winners than losers.  I&#039;m eager to march ahead.]]></description>

If another country is planning on attacking your country, and you deter them by a combination of building strong defences and negotiating mutually beneficial trade pacts, how have you &quot;harmed&quot; them?  Sure, they might consider themselves richer if they could enslave your whole nation.  But you&#039;ve neither harmed one hair on their heads, nor taken one dollar from their pockets (despite the fact they were planning on doing that to you).  I don&#039;t see this as insincere, but rather as a sincere desire for equal treatment, i.e. please respect us the way we are willing to respect you.]]></description>
