					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] In 1987 Richard Feynman wrote an article arguing in favor for negative probabilities. The question should not be: &#8220;do they exist?&#8221; but rather: &#8220;are they useful?&#8221;. People have for centuries denied the existence of negative numbers &#8211; but thinking about negative money as debts is undeniably useful. How would you do that with negative probabilities? The idea is to loosen the requirement that probabilities must be strictly positive in every calculation and just require the end result to be positive. If you are interested, check out this blog post that has a very nice overview. [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Suppose we have a water tank with two parallel pipes, each with a valve, that join at a common outlet. Both valves are open. Then we could say that with probability 1 there will be water at the outlet. But would it not be better to say the probability of water is 2, to capture the fact that after closing one valve we still get water (probability 1) and both valves have to be closed before the probability of getting water is 0?

Similarly, suppose we have a water tank with a single pipe, but with two valves. Both are closed. Then we could say that the probability of getting water at the outlet is 0. But wouldn&#039;t it be better to say that the probability is -1, to capture the fact that if one valve is opened there is still no water (probability 0), and it takes two valves to be open to get water (probability 1)?]]></description>

When renormalization was first developed it seemed ad hoc, but now we understand the physical meaning of it, e.g.:

&#8226; John Baez, &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2016/09/19/struggles-with-the-continuum-part-5/&quot;&gt;Struggles with the continuum (part 6)&lt;/a&gt;.

&#8226; John Baez, &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/renormalization.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Renormalization made easy&lt;/a&gt;.

This fact combined with its remarkable success at predicting results of experiments means few people are trying to get rid of it.  Certainly nobody knows how to do so without eliminating its successes.  I haven&#039;t heard of attempts to do this by allowing negative probabilities.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Feynman seems to hint that the infinities that occur in quantum physics and need to be renormalized are a direct result of forcing all probabilities to be nonnegative. Has anyone tried to apply negative probabilities to quantum field theories? And does this really remove the need for renormalization? That has always seemed the most ad hoc part of QED.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I recently came across this book by P. Muldowney : &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&#038;pid=sites&#038;srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxzdGllbHRqZXNjb21wbGV0ZXxneDpjZmM0YzUwNjIxNzY2MDE&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;A Modern Theory of Random Variation&lt;/a&gt;. Which presents a fomrulation of probability theory using the Henstock integral as a basic building block. This approach is indeed deeply fascinating, and extends the notion of &quot;probability&quot; to take on, for example, complex values. Also, from chapter 1 &quot;This extension of classical probability make it possible to bring the Feynman theory of the path integrals whitin the scope  of a theory of random variation&quot;

If you haven&#039;t seen it I can recommend at least browsing through the preface and the introduction.
Did anyone else here read this book, comments on it?]]></description>
