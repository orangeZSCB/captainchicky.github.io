You listed the &lt;em&gt;factors&lt;/em&gt; of 91; the prime factors are 7 and 13.  So if the year had 364 days, a quarter would have 91 days, and since a week has 7 days, a quarter would have 13 weeks!  Weird.]]></description>

Yes, and---especially with a name like yours---you might be interested to hear the best theory about why the days are named in the curious order they are:  Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn.  

Astrologers like to list these seven heavenly bodies in order of decreasing orbital period, counting the Sun as having period 365 days, and the Moon as period 29 days:

Saturn    (29 years)
Jupiter   (12 years)
Mars      (687 days)
Sun       (365 days)
Venus     (224 days)
Mercury   (88 days)
Moon      (29.5 days)

For the purposes of astrology they wanted to assign a planet to each hour of each day of the week. They did this in a reasonable way: they assigned Saturn to the first hour of the first day, Jupiter to the second hour of the first day, and so on, cycling through the list of planets over and over, until each of the 7 &#215; 24 = 168 hours was assigned a planet. Each day was then named after the first hour in that day. Since 24 mod 7 equals 3, this amounts to taking the above list and reading every third planet in it (mod 7), getting:

 
Saturn  (Saturday)
Sun     (Sunday)
Moon    (Monday)
Mars    (Tuesday)
Mercury (Wednesday)
Jupiter (Thursday)
Venus   (Friday)

I don&#039;t think anyone is &lt;i&gt;sure&lt;/i&gt; that this is how the days got the names they did; the earliest reference for this scheme is the Roman historian Dion Cassius (AD 150-235), who came long after the days were named. However, Dion says the scheme goes back to Egypt. In the Moralia of Plutarch (AD 46-120) there was an essay entitled &quot;Why are the days named after the planets reckoned in a different order from the actual order?&quot; Unfortunately this essay has been lost and only the title is known!]]></description>

Yes!  Her &lt;i&gt;Tale of a Thousand and One Nights&lt;/i&gt; features a lovely number, not just because 1001 is a palindrome in base 10, but because 1001 = 7 &#215; 11 &#215; 13.  This gives a good way to test large numbers for divisibility by these primes by hand!   Thanks to its nice look in base 10, you can easily subtract multiples of 1001 from a large number and then test the remainder for divisibility by 7, 11, or 13.  

I&#039;d known this for a long time, but only while teaching this class did I notice that if a &#039;season&#039; has 91 = 7 &#215; 13 days, or 13 weeks, then 1001 nights is exactly 11 seasons.

It&#039;s plausible that the number of days in the week comes from sun, moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn -- the 7 non-fixed heavenly bodies visible to the ancients.  The names of the days strongly suggest this, wouldn&#039;t you agree?]]></description>

This is probably implicit in the answer above, but another way of putting it is that you can write 91 as 13*(14/2). So it&#039;s a puzzle why we&#039;ve ended up with a week which is half &quot;number of weeks in a season+1&quot;... (I imagine 4 seasons is strongly &quot;suggested by the weather&quot;, but the choice of week length seems less externally suggested.)

Incidentally, another area to look if you&#039;re trying to win real-world games is into how well cards are shuffled: what often happens is that the structure of a game will cause certain cards to be played together, then the collected cards are inadequately shuffled, then the dealing process then redistributes the cards in a predictable way. So in a game like whist where all the cards are dealed out, the knowing how the previous hand played out and the cards you&#039;ve been dealt gives probabilities on what other players have ended up with.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This reminds me of how when I was a kid, I came up with an idea for a calendar with 13 months of 28 days each.  That gives 364 days, and the remaining day (or two, for leap years) would just be a special day that wasn&#039;t part of a month.  This would solve the difficult-to-remember month lengths.

Additionally, we could declare the special day(s) not to be part of the week, either.  That way the day-of-week wouldn&#039;t shift against the day-of-month from one year to the next - in this calendar, Thanksgiving and Easter would fall on the same dates every year.]]></description>
