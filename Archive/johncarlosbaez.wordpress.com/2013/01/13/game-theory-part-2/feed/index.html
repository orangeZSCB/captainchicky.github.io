It depends on how you generalize it to be a multiplayer game.  How would you do it?  For example, what happens if Alice says &quot;rock&quot;, Bob says &quot;paper&quot; and Charles says &quot;scissors&quot;?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2013/01/13/game-theory-part-2/#comment-24155&quot;&gt;John Baez&lt;/a&gt;.

In three dimensions, the Levi-Civita tensor $latex \epsilon_{ijk}$ is:

&#8226;1 when the indices $latex i,j,k$ (which range from 1 to 3) form an even permutation, 

&#8226; -1 when they form an odd permutation

&#8226; 0 otherwise.

So, the vector cross product is given by

$latex (v \times w)_i = \epsilon_{ijk} v_j w_k $

where we sum over repeated indices.  

In two dimensions the same idea gives a Levi--Civita tensor $latex \epsilon_{ij}$; in four it gives $latex \epsilon_{ijkl}$, and so on... but only in three does it give us a cross product.  In general it gives us a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_form&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;volume form&lt;/a&gt;.   All this stuff is very important in geometry and can be discussed at many different levels of sophistication.

The payoff matrix for the rock-paper-scissors game is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; the Levi--Civita tensor; it&#039;s something related but a bit mysterious to me!]]></description>

Permutations? (The Levi-Civita tensor/symbol looks like &quot;non-abstract&quot; nonsense to me. It might have some formalist benefit for non-formalists who insist on thinking geometry/tensor algebra in coordinates. Is it any good except for maximizing index mess and to strain IQ?)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2013/01/13/game-theory-part-2/#comment-24186&quot;&gt;Arrow&lt;/a&gt;.

As I mentioned, the simplified chicken game discussed here is a &#039;simultaneous&#039; game, where both players make a single move simultaneously.  It&#039;s already fascinating, as you can see in the analysis here:

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_%28game%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Chicken game&lt;/a&gt;, Wikipedia.

It seems that among game theorists the simultaneous version of chicken is &#039;the&#039; game of chicken.  The game reckless teenagers play with cars is a &#039;sequential&#039; game of a &#039;continuous&#039; sort: the players don&#039;t take turns, they&#039;re both observing each other at every moment and making their decisions based on what they say.  Pretty much every interesting feature of the simultaneous version shows up in the sequential version---and more.  

For example, both versions raise the issue of &#039;pre-commitment&#039;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
One tactic in the game is for one party to signal their intentions convincingly before the game begins. For example, if one party were to ostensibly disable their steering wheel just before the match, the other party would be compelled to swerve. This shows that, in some circumstances, reducing one&#039;s own options can be a good strategy. One real-world example is a protester who handcuffs himself to an object, so that no threat can be made which would compel him to move (since he cannot move). Another example, taken from fiction, is found in Stanley Kubrick&#039;s Dr. Strangelove. In that film, the Russians sought to deter American attack by building a &quot;doomsday machine,&quot; a device that would trigger world annihilation if Russia was hit by nuclear weapons or if any attempt were made to disarm it. However, the Russians failed to signal—they deployed their doomsday machine covertly.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Whoops!  &lt;img src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/emoticons/doh20.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[IMO this analysis of the chicken game doesn&#039;t really capture it&#039;s essence. The player strategies are not about binary choices between staying or swerving (even if that is the final outcome), rather they are about how long they are willing to stay on the road before swerving. The difference is that when expressed in this way there is an optimal strategy - stay until the time to collision is equal to the time your car needs to clear the road and not hit the other car. Of course that is certainly not easy to do in practice but still.]]></description>
