					<description><![CDATA[Great material.

Below the first example you have mentioned  &quot;Yes—and just as before, it happens when both players pick pure strategy 1.&quot;

Isn&#039;t both players picking pure strategy 2 also a Nash equilibrium?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There might be a couple of mix-ups:

Shortly before the definition of Nash equilibrium, regarding the first example...
&quot;If player A switches to choice 2, their payoff drops to 9 points. If player B switches to choice 2, their payoff drops to 1 point.&quot;
It looks like player A&#039;s payoff would drop to -1 by switching to choice 2; on the other hand, player B&#039;s payoff would drop to 9 by switching to choice 2.

Similarly in the third example...
&quot;If player A changes her choice, her payoff drops to 9. And if player B changes his choice, his payoff drops to 8.&quot;
It looks like if player A changes to choice 2, her payoff drops to -1; if player B changes to choice 2, his payoff drops to -1.]]></description>

Nice question!  I&#039;ll let someone else answer, so they can get a bit of practice.  Either a student in the class, or someone reading this blog...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice post---thanks.  

In the second example, is there more than one Nash equilibrium?  E.g., cell (1, 2) with $latex A_{12} = -1$ and $latex B_{12} = 10$:  if A switches from 1 to 2, then $latex A_{22} = -1 \le A_{12}$ and if B switches from 2 to 1, then $latex B_{11} = 10 \le B_{12}$.  So neither can improve with a unilateral move.  Is that right?  (I suspect I&#039;m confused about something....)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Possible typo: in the definition of Nash equilibrium, for the second condition, might it be 1&#060;=j&#039;&#060;=n (instead of m) ? I recall that the second player can choose between n strategies, not m.

Thanks for these nice and useful entries.]]></description>
