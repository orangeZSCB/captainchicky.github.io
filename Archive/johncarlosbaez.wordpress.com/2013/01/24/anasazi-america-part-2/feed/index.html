					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2013/01/24/anasazi-america-part-2/#comment-62800&quot;&gt;nad&lt;/a&gt;.

Your grandfather story sounds quite interesting. Maybe there actually is an Ansatz for a book? (Beyond Vorwärtsverteidigung. If there is some similarity to your project. Actually what you tell smells a bit like you&#039;re on a similar Holzweg.)

(I haven&#039;t read/followed much Azimuth for quite some time, for I was trapped in heavy brain work (pondering and extending millions of lines of undocumented legacy Java code). Now that ugly job is gone, I&#039;m free again, and will hopefully never return wasting my brain for money and time. Looking for a job as farm hand instead. Yes, as another pillar of my Rentenversicherung.)

It looks/smells you&#039;re a bit too much into quantifying things. 

But our life support system is nonlinear (incl. lots of circular causality on diverse time scales) so numbers are not very helpful when the system is stretched to its boundaries. Add to that &quot;natural&quot; fluctuations of parameters (like it happened in Syria and will happen to the hypothetically non-emigratory Amish) and things will get totally unpredictable. A different Ansatz is needed here: Qualitative understanding, something like http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysiology .
 Here&#039;s a paradigmatic example of that thinking: http://planet3.org/2015/01/03/is-climate-risk-systematically-understated/#comment-1771793  (I&#039;m typing on a stupid Android netbook without &#060; &#062; on the keyboard).

Alas human nature wants numbers, not qualitative wisdom, and greed then wants to stretch the numbers to the limits. Alas we are beyond the limits now, using 1.5 planets/year... ==&#062; What is desperately needed is change in behaviour and attitude toward Earth and survival, not just a change in parameters. As I said in the &quot;Google gave up&quot; thread: The most economic thing is to kill ourselves. Shall we do that? Or better give up economic metaphysics, the failed pseudo rationality?

Reminds me of the old Einstein quote: &quot;We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2013/01/24/anasazi-america-part-2/#comment-62776&quot;&gt;Martin Gisser&lt;/a&gt;.

I think what&#039;s needed here is a more detailed assessment of land and resource need sorted with respect to human activities, which is in particular including land need for energy generation etc. That is the high growth rate for the amish is probably partially due to religious customs but given their low tech standard probably also needed. That is amongst others agriculture without many machines is quite labour intensive. Machines however also need energy. They are partially fed by crops, just as humans (biofuel) but they can also &quot;eat&quot; fossil fuels which seem to be eventually more energy intensive. So those machines need also either land (solar energy (regarding solar energy harvesting from space still as futuristic)) or &quot;stored solar energy&quot; (i.e. fossil fuels) or other stored resources (like nuclear). Moreover the Amish appear to be at least somewhat protected by the US surroundings, things would look even less good if they would need to defend their territory.

As said I am missing out a trustworthy and really detailed but conscise assessment and thus tried to gather this information myself (see e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Utopia&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Economic+growth+and+limitations&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, newer information might still be somewhat scattered like &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2014/03/25/civilizational-collapse-part-1/#comment-39491&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2014/04/16/what-does-the-new-ipcc-report-say-about-climate-change-part-6/#comment-40511&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; etc.). The current (sofar unpublished) written up &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.randform.org/blog/?p=3991&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;version&lt;/a&gt; is a bit more detailed and restructured. But I am also still in the stage of assessing, which activities should be accounted for as relevant and how those are connected with human nature. In that game plot Utopia I thought that this could at least partially be assessed within a game-like setting, but since quite a while I also kept trying to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Surplusses+and+Exchange&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;sort&lt;/a&gt; that out a bit myself. Currently this appears to me necessary for conciseness.

But gathering all this it is not really something I super-like to do but which I only do because it seems (at least to me) urgently needed and secondly it is quite a task, which is hardly to be handled by one person as a &quot;free-time&quot; task. In particular the work at this &quot;gathering&quot; exceeded already what I could really afford as &quot;free-time task&quot; given my pension expectations (and partially also of what I like to do). I am thus thinking about whether I should make that into a book in order to get some chance of reimbursement for this work.

There are though problems with this &quot;book&quot; concept. One is that some of the data is partially rather fast outdated, so it would be better to include the possibility of (to be paid ?) updates (ebook portal?). Another problem might be that not too many people like to hear about limitations, so the readership might be considerably lower than for pure entertainment, regardless how entertaining you write such a book. The fact that I am german and the &quot;german inclination towards austerity&quot; is globally already seen with critical eyes and the fact that my grandfather did a somewhat similar &quot;accounting job&quot; for the Nazis will eventually make me even less appealing as an author for such a thing....that is I already see the sentence: &quot;german Nazi-granddaughter wants to tell us what to eat and how to live!&quot; in front of me. 

But there are even more mundane problems, like since I am not an official journalist, I am not eligible to Künstlersozialkasse and thus any not-profitable enough effort could leed to bad debts due to a not very well adapted &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.randform.org/blog/?p=4845&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt; social insurance fee policy.&lt;/a&gt; Yes it&#039;s crazy but working mommy might cost the family well a couple of thousand Euros.

So even if one would make that &quot;book&quot; let&#039;s say into an Azimuth Kickstarter project, I might not be able to &quot;risk&quot; an imbursement.]]></description>

Reminds me of the Syrian population explosion... The good Amish would soon get unsustainable. Then, having reached systemic boundaries, a little eco shock like some drought would suffice to engender rapid collapse. Suigenocide by overpopulation: Basic ecology combined with bloody human nature. This age old scenario should be called the &quot;Syria scenario&quot;. When will they ever learn?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Quote from the above quote by Stuart:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Think of Amish farmers in Pennsylvania...&lt;/blockquote&gt;
and
&lt;blockquote&gt;But when energy (food, fuel and resources) becomes scarce, or when trade and technology fail, an efficient society is advantageous because it simpler, less wasteful structure is more easily sustained in times of scarcity. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

and a quote from Wikipedia:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As of 2000, over 165,000 Old Order Amish live in the United States and about 1,500 live in Canada.[5] A 2008 study suggested their numbers have increased to 227,000,[6] and in 2010 a study suggested their population had grown by 10 percent in the past two years to 249,000, with increasing movement to the West.[7]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If the Amish have that strong (?) population growth as the Wikipedia article suggests then amongst others I find a question which arises here is here: how &quot;more easily sustained would the amish live on one and the same confined territory.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi,

Recently stumbled on Azimuth.  Great.  Thanks.

Enjoyed these posts especially as I live in this neck of the woods.
You may have read this:

http://www.amazon.com/Collapse-Complex-Societies-Studies-Archaeology/dp/052138673X

... if not, you might enjoy it.  J. Tainter examines Roman, Lowland Maya and Chacoan societal collapse.  Concludes that &#039;diminishing marginal returns on complexity&#039; are root cause, if I read him right.  Might bear on our current situation, and some of your themes...

Cheers!

					<description><![CDATA[If you are interested I took some poor man&#039;s 3D pictures of the Mesa Verde park. Since most of the places are visible from across the canyons, I took a pictures, then walked laterally for about 30 meters, then took a second picture.
This gives the idea that the position of the pictures is much closer, standing up in the air. Of course this kind of parallax trick has his (flattening etc. limits) but it&#039;s not too bad and the results aren&#039;t terrible.
