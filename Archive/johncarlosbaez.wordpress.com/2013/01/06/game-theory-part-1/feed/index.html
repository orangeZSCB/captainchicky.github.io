					<description><![CDATA[Puzzle:
For the game of perfect information, the player knows each other&#039;s move, or they know what each other have done in the game. For the game of complete information, the player not necessary knows what others have done in his or her move. They don&#039;t have information; however, they know what&#039;s their pay off. The difference which is that, the prefect of the game is all about the knowledge of other player&#039;s movement, or their strategy. And the game of complete information is something about the benefit what each player can gain at the end of the game.]]></description>

That&#039;s an interesting question.  You can go either direction on this; just explain your reasoning in your answer.  But in a typical team sport, the official rules tell us how to compute payoffs (numbers of points) for each &lt;em&gt;team&lt;/em&gt;, and they say which &lt;em&gt;team&lt;/em&gt; wins.  They don&#039;t give a payoff to any individual on that team.

Of course, people who follow team sports like to make up their own ways of assigning a payoff to an individual: for example, how many home runs a baseball player scores, or their batting average, etc.  We can use these numbers to decide which individual wins some sort of prize.  But this isn&#039;t usually built into the rules of the game.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When we think about the number of players, are we thinking about them as individuals each seeking to personally win the game? Or can we think about 2 teams as 2 players since they are trying to achieve the same goal?]]></description>

That&#039;s an interesting question!  I think that if the same rules apply to each team, then it&#039;s symmetric, even if the rules say the teams must take turns doing different things.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Is baseball a symmetric game or a non-symmetric game? If it is symmetric then the same rules apply to each player when on offense and to each player when on defense. But it can also be claimed as non-symmetric since the defensive and offensive players a side by different rules at the same time.]]></description>

Okay, I&#039;ll do something like this!  I suspect that only one or two people will take the trouble to produce good notes in a consistent way.  In that case your &quot;no same winner two weeks in a row&quot; rule would be a bit problematic.  But something like this should work.]]></description>

Yeah. The card game, though it can be a board game, depending on which version you get. In the case it&#039;s a board game (I think it&#039;s the Deluxe edition?), the board is really superfluous. 

I don&#039;t know if I&#039;d say it&#039;s just a game of luck without much strategy. Having to discard to get those temporary bonuses from being a wizard is kind of a high cost. All the classes/races have a set of advantages and disadvantages that is pretty balanced, I think, and an adept player could probably play all the classes/races nearly equally well, depending on the cards available to them (luck). Personally, I think if anything&#039;s overpowered, it&#039;s the Halflings. ;)]]></description>

Munchkin as a board game? I know the card game. Played casually it is quite funny. However becoming a wizard, which is random, usually suffices to survive the retaliation. So it is basically a game of luck without much strategy. At least, that was my impression.]]></description>
