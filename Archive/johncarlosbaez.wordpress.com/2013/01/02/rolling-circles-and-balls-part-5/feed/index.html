					<description><![CDATA[Further to the previous post, the result does seem a bit counter-intuitive but here is a practical demonstration. Suppose you assign ball S1 a &quot;north pole&quot; at the top. If you had it there on the table you could replace it by a disc, for example a coin. For the convenience of US readers I am actually doing this with two Kennedy half-dollars. So: with coin S1 on the table, showing Kennedy&#039;s head upright, the north pole axis comes out vertically. Now put the other half-dollar (S2) touching the right of the first one, again with Kennedy&#039;s head upright. As per specifications flip S2 about the line of centres, so you get the eagle upright (notionally with the south pole pointing up). Holding S1 stationary, roll S2 about 45 degrees toward you around the edge of S1. Flip S2 about the new centre-line and there is Kennedy upright again!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Here is a much simpler rolling ball problem, not entirely off-topic I hope. Suppose you have a fixed spherical ball S1. Let S2 be a copy of S1, with its centre displaced two radii from that of S1 (so the balls just touch), and rotated exactly 180 degrees about the line of the centres.

The system is controlled by moving the centre of S2 while maintaining the given constraints. Show that when this is done S2 rolls without slipping on S1.]]></description>

I hadn&#039;t known that!  I deceive for educational rather than entertainment purposes, but there&#039;s actually a big overlap between education and entertainment, especially in posts like this one: it&#039;s not as if most of you &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; to know about rolling balls and split octonions, so reading about the connection between them is a bit like watching a magician pull a rabbit out the hat.  But in my case, ideally, you&#039;d completely understand how the trick is done yet still be amazed by it!]]></description>

Thanks, I&#039;ll fix that typo.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ams.org/notices/200808/tx080800922p.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Agricola&#039;s article&lt;/a&gt; was very important to me, since that&#039;s where I learned that the Grassmannians for the split real form of G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; were the 1d null subspaces and 2d null subalgebras of the split octonions.  I knew these should be the points and lines of some rolling ball geometry....

The relation between the rolling ball geometry and $latex \mathbb{O}P^1 \cong S^8$ seems to be indirect.  

The 8-dimensional manifold $latex \mathbb{O}\mathrm{P}^1$ is the space of light rays through the origin in a 10-dimensional spacetime with 1 time and 9 space dimensions.  So, it&#039;s a homogeneous space for SO(9,1).  Thanks to the 10 dimensions, I expect a lot of connections to string theory, though I only know &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/octonions/node11.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;a few&lt;/a&gt;.

The 5-dimensional manifold I&#039;m calling $latex X$ in this article---the space of ways a spinorial ball can touch a projective ball with radius 3 times as big---is the space of light rays through the origin in a 7-dimensional spacetime with 3 time and 4 space dimensions.   So, it&#039;s a homogeneous space of SO(4,3)... but also of the split real form of the exceptional group G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Probably the best  hope of relating them is fitting both of them in some larger context.  Both SO(9,1) and the &lt;i&gt;compact&lt;/i&gt; form of G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fit very nicely in a certain real form of E&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, since the latter is the group of &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/octonions/node17.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;line-preserving transformations of the octonionic projective plane, $latex \mathbb{O}\mathrm{P}^2.$&lt;/a&gt;  So, it seems that   SO(9,1) and the &lt;i&gt;split&lt;/i&gt; form of G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; should fit in  the &lt;i&gt;complex&lt;/i&gt; form of E&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;.  This complex form is the group of all line-preserving transformations of the complexified octonionic projective plane, $latex (\mathbb{C} \otimes \mathbb{O})\mathrm{P}^2.$  So, I&#039;d look here for answers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2013/01/02/rolling-circles-and-balls-part-5/#comment-23608&quot;&gt;Joris Vankerschaver&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks!  I have no such hope myself.  For one thing, G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is fundamentally different than the other four exceptional Lie groups.  G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the subgroup of Spin(8) that fixes a vector in each of its three 8-dimensional irreducible representations; this winds up meaning that the 5-dimensional Grassmannian for G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;---the space of points in the rolling ball geometry I&#039;m talking about here---is also a Grassmannian for Spin(8).  That underlies everything that goes on here.  

On the other hand, F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, E&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, E&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; and E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; fit together as a row of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/octonions/node16.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&#039;magic square&#039;&lt;/a&gt;.  They&#039;re the symmetry groups of certain Riemannian manifolds of dimensions 16, 32, 64 and 128, respectively.   The first two of these are projective planes in the usual axiomatic sense, while the other two are &#039;like&#039; projective planes in some mysterious sense that needs to be understood.  That&#039;s where I&#039;d go to understand these Lie groups better.  But the only person I can imagine working on this with is John Huerta, and I don&#039;t think either of us should spend our time this way!]]></description>

People probably already know this, but &quot;honest liar&quot; is one of the slang terms for a magician, which seems a fitting description of the Wizard. (I&#039;m at least aware of it from James Randi,  although the interpretation is slightly different: a magician is an honest liar in that he admits he&#039;s deceiving you for entertainment purposes, as opposed to people like mediums who claim they&#039;re totally honest.)]]></description>
