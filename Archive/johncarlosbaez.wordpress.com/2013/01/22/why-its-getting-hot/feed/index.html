Thanks for the link to Bart Verheggen&#039;s blog.

So this idea is nothing new. And I guess someone has already done a good writeup of the absurdity of these fancy economic-Nobel statistics. In our case I bet the stuff is easiest refuted with simple numerical experiments.

It is quite an assumption that a time series be &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;autoregressive&lt;/a&gt; (of finite, fixed order). That needs some proof (model) and you can forget about statistical tests. As &lt;a href=&quot;http://tamino.wordpress.com/2010/03/16/still-not/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Tamino&lt;/a&gt; put it: &lt;i&gt;The whole “&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_root&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;unit root&lt;/a&gt;” idea is nothing but a “throw some complicated-looking math at the wall and see what sticks”&lt;/i&gt;]]></description>

I&#039;ve not read the paper in question, but there have been long discussions about the validity and relevance of these techniques for studying climatic time series. A nice place to start is Bart&#039;s blog 

http://ourchangingclimate.wordpress.com/?s=unit+root

My feeling is that the above commenters here at Azimuth are correct: one cannot divorce the statistical interpretation from the underlying physics, chemistry, biology, geophysics etc.. 

If one starts from a position of maximal ignorance and one just uses these techniques to analyze the time series, then I think that they are correct and give useful information on what can be said about the underlying processes (e.g. are they like Brownian motion) and whether one has enough data (just data alone, not data and science) to be reasonably sure about this identification. In other words, one can analyze a time series without knowing anything else about it and say that the underlying process causing this is like Brownian motion, or Brownian motion plus something else.

However, we&#039;re not in a state of maximal ignorance; we have a pretty good understanding of the basic principles of what drives climate, and this knowledge has to be taken into consideration when interpreting the data. 

Now, one might justifiably argue that this is not strictly science (i.e. not strict hypothesis testing) because we are mixing our hypotheses with the interpretation of the data. But that epistemological discussion is for another day when I don&#039;t have to rush away to teach about the fluid mechanics of swimming fish and drag reduction. 

Just my ha-penny&#039;s worth.

The cointegration method they use comes from economics, and was apparently very popular in the 80s and 90s. This paper severely criticizes the method:

&#8226; Imad Moosa, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.capco.com/capco-institute/capco-journal/journal-32-applied-finance/the-failure-of-financial-econometrics-asses&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Failure of financial econometrics: assessing the cointegration “Revolution”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Applied Finance.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Abstract.&lt;/b&gt; One aspect of the failure of financial econometrics is the use of cointegration analysis for financial decision making and policy analysis. This paper demonstrates that the results obtained by using different cointegration tests vary considerably and that they are not robust with respect to model specification. It is also demonstrated that, contrary to what is claimed, cointegration analysis does not allow distinction between spurious relations and genuine ones. Some of the pillars of cointegration analysis are not supported by the results presented in this study. Specifically it is shown that cointegration does not necessarily imply, or is implied by, a valid error correction representation and that causality is not necessarily present in at least one direction. More importantly, however, cointegration analysis does not lead to sound financial decisions, and a better job can be done by using simple correlation analysis.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
What I’d like to see then, is a thorough rebuttal on grounds of statistical theory.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yes, I&#039;d like to see that too.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If their statistics are correct, this would be one possible explanation: the increase in atmospheric carbon is a transient, as is the consequent global warming.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thanks for the clarification. Well then, since apparently you, I and the authors all seem to agree that through greenhouse physics there is a link between atmospheric carbon concentration and global warming, I think they should have run their statistical tests directly between the amount of atmospheric carbon and the human carbon emissions, to find out if there&#039;s a long-term effect here, instead of blending it with temperatures.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A doubling of carbon emissions doesn’t imply a long term doubling of atmospheric carbon.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Of course not! (a) I suppose you mean &quot;net&quot; emissions, and (b) in the short term the relation between total atmospheric carbon and total net emissions is additive (not proportional) so without feedback mechanisms (like the sink term is proportional to the atmospheric carbon, in a very simple model) it would be additive in the long term too. The emissions are linearly related to the rate of change of atmospheric carbon.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Depending on the long term behaviour of carbon sinks, it could conceivably leave atmospheric carbon unchanged in the long term. or quadruple it
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Coming back to the statistics. This is physics/biology/chemistry, but not data analysis. And conceivably, yes, anything can happen, but without a good explanation (better than: we can&#039;t know so why not) the simpler solution is to be preferred, unless the statistics is very strong indeed.]]></description>

A doubling of carbon emissions doesn&#039;t imply a long term doubling of atmospheric carbon. Depending on the long term behaviour of carbon sinks, it could conceivably leave atmospheric carbon unchanged in the long term. or quadruple it - unchanged if there are sufficiently large sinks which work on a long enough time scale to have been overlooked, quadrupled if increasing temperatures diminish the capacity of existing sinks causing the release of stored carbon.

&lt;i&gt;If&lt;/i&gt; their statistics are correct, this would be one possible explanation: the increase in atmospheric carbon is a transient, as is the consequent global warming. The extra 10^15 Watts is real, but isn&#039;t here to stay.

However, the first question should really be whether their statistical tests are reliable. If they are, the climatologists will have to explain how this can be - scientists don&#039;t get to ignore inconvenient maths. If they&#039;re unreliable, we can tell the economists they don&#039;t understand maths - which a lot of people probably already suspect.

Some economists do deal with broadly similar problems in their field, so we can&#039;t blithely assume they&#039;ve got the maths wrong. It does need checking, by an expert in statistics. (If the price of petrol goes up, how does that affect the price of potatoes? There are transient effects, from the increased transport cost, but in the long run there are all kinds of knock on effects that may end up partially cancelling this out,)

What I&#039;d like to see then, is a thorough rebuttal on grounds of statistical theory.]]></description>

Yes, but &#039;natural variations&#039; is not an &lt;i&gt;explanation&lt;/i&gt; of what&#039;s going on now.   If you say current-day global warming is due to &#039;natural variations&#039;, you need to present a theory of what&#039;s causing these.  Natural variations always have a physical cause.  

This cause can be hard to figure out for the climate long ago.  But given the detailed data we have about the current-day climate system, it would be absurd to suggest that 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; watts of power are going into the oceans and atmosphere for some unknowable reason.   We should&#8212;and can&#8212;account for that power.

Scientists are also making progress on understanding climates long ago, but since there wasn&#039;t a huge network of weather stations, satellites, etc., and it takes work to even figure out basic things like the shape of the continents, this will take longer.  ]]></description>

A single glance at past temperature reconstructions should be enough to tell anyone that much higher temperature swings took place in the past, many without homo sapiens even being there to witness them. So yes, natural variations can easily dwarf human contributions.]]></description>

Or to put it in a slightly less diplomatic way, the last sentence you quoted (i.e., “This is not an argument about physics, but an argument about data interpretation.”) seems to be patently false in that one cannot argue for their interpretation of the data without also arguing against established physics.

Right: trying to understand global warming without using any knowledge of physics amounts to tying both hands behind our backs.  This is true even at the simplest level.  The rising temperature of the oceans and atmosphere mean that their energy is increasing enormously.  In fact the power required for this temperature increase is approximately 1,000,000 gigawatts (that is, 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; watts).  Conservation of energy says this energy must be coming somewhere!  If we simply wave our hands and blame &#039;natural variations in climate&#039; we are being as silly as someone who believes in every perpetual motion machine that comes along.  

We need to use all the knowledge we have to get a good understanding of global warming.]]></description>
