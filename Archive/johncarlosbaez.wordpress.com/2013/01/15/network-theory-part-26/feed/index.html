					<description><![CDATA[Some year ago I propose a solution for an Innocentive challenge (quiet, I loose) on a sensor swarm; I use a simple theory on a smart dna-like-chip, with a radio transmission protocoll to connect the sensors with distribuited chip: the transmission protocoll use the protein-like packet from sensor swarm to calculus chip (it is like the dna), and this is similar to a insect swarm (pheromones messenger) or like brain messages between neurons (neurotransmitters) or a Petri net dynamic.
I see, after a while, an interesting construction of a low cost parallel computer: instead of a sensor swarm, it is possible to use a chip swarm to make calculus (the swarm have little component and low cost); but it are necessary a low cost (and robust) protocoll and hardware: I think that (an evolution of the) usb protocoll and device are the better (it contain the power supply transmission).
So a net of dna-like chip with a light operating system (like Qnx), low memory, and micro usb 3.0 tranmission (with new usb switch) can be useful for weather forecast, computational fluid dynamics, computational chemistry, etc: I think a computer without motherboard, but a multiplicity of chips in a square net, connected to the powered inputs and outputs.
I think that can be possible a campus net, with simple usb connector: a client connect a keyboard, a usb flash drive, a display and work.

Saluti

					<description><![CDATA[The part about ‘Turing-complete-up-to-epsilon’ reminded me about this article by Mark Changizi  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.changizi.com/viscomp.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Harnessing vision for computation&lt;/a&gt;, with the abstract: 

&quot;Might it be possible to harness the visual system to carry out artificial computations, somewhat akin to how DNA has been harnessed to carry out computation? I provide the beginnings of a research programme attempting to do this. In particular, new techniques are described for building `visual circuits&#039; (or   &#039;visual software&#039;) using wire, NOT, OR, and AND gates in a visual modality such that our visual system acts as &#039;visual hardware&#039; computing the circuit, and generating a resultant perception which is the output.&quot;

So, it looks like the visual system is able to perform &quot;Turing&quot; computation, up to errors which diminish with training, but nevertheless is able to recreate the world as we see it 8 times per second. Funny.]]></description>
