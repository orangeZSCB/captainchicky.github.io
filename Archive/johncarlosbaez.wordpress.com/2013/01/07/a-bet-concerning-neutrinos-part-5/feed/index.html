Thanks very much!  I&#039;m glad you conceded---that&#039;s very honorable of you.  So did Frederik de Roo.  He is starting to pay off his debt by writing some blog articles explaining why the heating effect of carbon dioxide (the &#039;forcing&#039;) grows logarithmically with the carbon dioxide concentration---instead of, say, linearly.

I&#039;ll think a bit about how you could help the Azimuth Project.  I&#039;m also open to suggestions... as long as the time you spend generating those suggestions doesn&#039;t count as part of the 2 days of work.  &lt;img src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/emoticons/devil.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Though I always hope for new physics, this was a long shot.

I interpret from the above that you&#039;ve claimed a win. Which given the original team&#039;s inability to reproduce the original results after accounting for the problems with the original experiment, I will concede under the terms of our bet. So that means:

&lt;i&gt;&quot;If they decide it’s false, John will communicate with Curtis to determine an appropriate set of tasks for his two days based on Curtis’s expertise and John’s needs at that time, these currently include: writing, trading and finance, business and entrepreneurship, programming and software development. Curtis agrees to perform those two working days worth of tasks of John’s choosing within 1 year of the decision that neutrinos cannot go faster than light.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;

So you&#039;ve got two days of my time consulting. Feel free to email me, or contact me on Skype  if you want to figure out what you&#039;d like me to do in an interactive fashion.

My time is at your service. :-)

If you want, I can come up with some more specific proposals for what I might be able to do to give you some place to start.]]></description>

Does a 200 nanosecond rise time really suck?  Obviously it sucks for this particular application... but how hard is it to do better?

The people who took bets with me were all friends who, rather than being convinced that the OPERA experiment was right, seemed willing to have a little fun and be forced to do something nice for me if they lost the bet.

I would have been happy to bet against crackpots who were &lt;i&gt;sure&lt;/i&gt; the OPERA experiment was right, but no such people answered my public call for bets.

What I really want is to make bets regarding global warming.  However, I&#039;ve only managed one puny little bet about whether the extent of Arctic sea ice will recover from its current decline in a while:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/2012/08/record-dominoes-8-nsidc-daily-sea-ice-extent.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ecological/arctic_minimum_sea_ice_area_cryosphere_today_9_2012.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Someone believes we&#039;re near the end of a natural cycle.  Unfortunately the bet was so puny that I can&#039;t even remember his name, and I&#039;ll probably forget to collect!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m no physicist, but I read quite a bit on the subject, including some of the low-level mathematical treatments of special relativity.  When I first heard of the OPERA result, I thought it was instantly obvious to practically everyone that there had to be some experimental error.  So I&#039;d be curious to know what led some folks to be so convinced of the possible correctness of the experiment as to actually bet on the outcome.  (OK, mostly I&#039;m just jealous because *I* didn&#039;t win some ham!)]]></description>

Red-Eye Gravy:  http://southernfood.about.com/od/hamrecipes/r/bl00921a.htm 
 
Canned biscuits are fine - some people eat the red-eye on the grits, or the biscuits.  (My family put the gravy on the biscuits and &quot;sopped&quot; up the plate with them as well.)  In your grits, put a big chunk of cream cheese, like a heaping tablespoon for 2-4 servings, and stir.  I sincerely confess that the idea of eating greasy coffee never has and never will appeal to me, however, this meal is *straight* from the South.  Eggs, too.  My arteries are clogging just trying to describe it.]]></description>
