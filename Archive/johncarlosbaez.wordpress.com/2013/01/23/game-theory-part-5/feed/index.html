There is also a funny strategic game called stratego
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratego
where sometimes it is better to sacrifice some material to gain some information. The price of information is valuable !]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2013/01/23/game-theory-part-5/#comment-24582&quot;&gt;Tim van Beek&lt;/a&gt;.

Yes, this is important too!   I don&#039;t feel I understand this quite as well as I&#039;d like, because beside the games you mention, there are games without any of what we&#039;d normally call &#039;chance&#039; or &#039;randomness&#039;, but where some players have incomplete information about other player&#039;s moves.   

In America a famous game like this is called &#039;Battleship&#039;---it&#039;s a simple model of a war.  

In war, incomplete information is of fundamental importance; there&#039;s chance but also lots of deliberate concealment.

In &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2013/01/06/game-theory-part-1/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt;, I posed this puzzle:

&lt;b&gt;Puzzle.&lt;/b&gt; What’s a ‘game of perfect information’ and what’s a ‘game of complete information’? What’s the difference? 

and Antifilon replied:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A game is of complete information if the players know who the other players are and also their best strategies and the payoffs. A game is of perfect information if all the players have perfect knowledge of the sequence of moves performed in the game.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

Whoops!  I stuck in the &quot;armed robbery&quot; joke at the last minute, long after writing the original homework problem.  I&#039;ll remove the murder, which is a bit too grim anyway.

By the way, I was delighted to discover that Wikipedia&#039;s page on solitaire shows a picture of a woman in prison playing solitaire.   So, I could form a nice visual connection between that game and the Prisoner&#039;s Dilemma.

She&#039;s dressed in a suspiciously attractive way for a prisoner, though.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Slightly off topic, but isn&#039;t the information available to each player also an important category for classifying games?  With the possible values

 every player has complete information about the situation (chess),

 every player has the same but incomplete information (betting in a horse race),

 every player has incomplete information, which differs from player to player (poker).]]></description>
