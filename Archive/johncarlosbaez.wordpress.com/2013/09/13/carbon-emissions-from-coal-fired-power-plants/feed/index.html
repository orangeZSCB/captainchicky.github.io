It is quite irrelevant if it was accepted or not, the point is &quot;rate of olivine weathering is not hampered by reaction-inhibiting silica at the surface of olivine grains&quot; if &quot;continuous mutual impacts remove such reaction-inhibiting surface layers&quot; in &quot;high-energy shallow marine environments as a giant marine ball mill&quot;.

Don&#039;t worry: the American Public Power Association is trying to get the EPA to raise the limits for coal-fired power plants from the proposed limit of 1,400 pounds per megawatt-hour (which is already above the proposed 1,000-pound limit for gas) to 1,900 pounds.  They will probably file a lawsuit to do this.

With a really good carbon market, we could avoid some of these fights: people could put more carbon dioxide into the air if they paid for the damage it caused.]]></description>

If &quot;even in the absence of this rule, existing and anticipated economic conditions in the marketplace will lead electricity generators to choose technologies that meet the proposed standards&quot;, then the absence of rules is clearly preferable. NYT may be right, &quot;in an era of cheap natural gas, hardly anyone in the United States is building coal-fired power plants&quot;.

But natural gas is only guaranteed to remain cheap if its market share is threatened by coal. With a rule effectively banning coal, it would no longer be the case. It would let producers restrict supply and drive prices up substantially.]]></description>

Oops, I mentally reversed the color key.  So I *should* have said:

&quot;...one can’t use it to conclude much about the naughtiness of the biggest *producers*, but one *can* conclude that, in each state listed, the biggest 5 *emitters* are as a group substantially *more* naughty than average (sometimes, radically so).]]></description>

Thanks for the links.

The EPA document includes the following …
“As explained in detail in this document, energy market data and projections support the conclusion that, even in the absence of this rule, existing and anticipated economic conditions in the marketplace will lead electricity generators to choose technologies that meet the proposed standards.  Therefore, based on the analysis presented in Chapter 5, EPA anticipates that the proposed EGU GHG NSPS will result in negligible CO2 emission changes, energy impacts, quantified benefits, costs, and economic impacts by 2020.  Accordingly, EPA also does not anticipate this rule will have any impacts on the price of electricity, employment or labor markets, or the US economy. Nonetheless, this rule may have several important beneficial effects described below.”

The NYT piece says in part …
“In some ways, the debate seems moot. In an era of cheap natural gas, hardly anyone in the United States is building coal-fired power plants.”

So new rules aren&#039;t needed. One could say that the rule making process here is a make-work undertaking just in case. Or one could say that where the EPA document calls for &quot;government support&quot; of technology development it is a ripe cherry ready to be picked by some set of rent-seekers. Perhaps the development of the new rules should become a just victim of sequestration.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;If carbon emissions were strictly proportional to the amount of energy produced, that would tend to undercut the the notion that the biggest carbon emitters are especially naughty.&quot;

Those EPA regulations are designed to kill coal fired power plants selectively while giving a competitive edge to natural gas fired ones. It is clearly a plot designed by Big Oil to grab the entire market, nothing else.

The proposed regulation sets an upper limit of 1000 lbs CO₂ emission per MWh. Equivalent emission while burning pure carbon is 887.5 lbs, for methane it is 392 lbs.

It is impossible to operate a plant at ~90% thermal efficiency, not to mention over 100%, which would be required for actual coal. Therefore no coal fired power plant is viable.

On the other hand, a Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) plant can achieve a thermal efficiency around 60% (653 lbs CO₂ / MWh) or up to 42% (933 lbs CO₂ / MWh) with a single cycle gas fired steam power plant.

In the wake of the recent widespread use of an old technology (hydraulic fracking) there is an overproduction of natural gas on the US market, that&#039;s the woe EPA is trying to fix.

Once it is done, there is no limit to rising electricity (and gas) prices, a yummy prospect, is it not?]]></description>
