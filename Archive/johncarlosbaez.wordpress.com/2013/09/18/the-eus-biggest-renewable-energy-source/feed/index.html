It would actually be interesting what percentage of produced &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood_pellets&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;wood pellets&lt;/a&gt; are actually from waste. I fear that the percentage might eventually meanwhile be smaller than &quot;most&quot;.

I want to add that apart from political obstacles there are of course also economical obstacles (for me these two are so interconnected that I sometimes forget to list them seperately) . 
Like for example &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.canadianbiomassmagazine.ca/content/view/3918/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;volatile exchange rates&lt;/a&gt; may pose an obstacle. 

This should by the way also challenge certain views about &quot;trading schemes&quot; in the electricity sector (we had this before), moreover it displays what a breakdown of the Euro could imply and who might be interested in that.

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is possible to design fuel cycles where no long half life isotope is left in waste, severing the link between power generation and military applications.

Plutonium waste is already used in MOX fuels. I would like to get a reference to your assertion &quot;It is possible to design fuel cycles where no long half life isotope is left in waste&quot;. I was actually searching for more information on that. In particular I would like to know what means &quot;long&quot; in this context?

As far as I know there are sofar no closed fuel cycles that is currently there is always waste and this waste is currently still rather big and dangerous. Moreover it seems that alone for economical reasons it may make no sense to install closed cycles. That is Thorium and Uranium 238 are more or less abundant and you can breed new fuel without recycling. If producing nuclear waste doesn&#039;t cost much  then recycling within a more costly closed fuel cycle won&#039;t most probably not happen. On the contrary by using breeders it will be rather probable that the Plutonium market will grow.

Apart from that the handling of nuclear waste is of course not really easy and without dangers and of course the waste products may still be used for weapons. 

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Nuclear-Fuel-Cycle/Fuel-Recycling/Plutonium/#.UkGjWCS0bhM&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;World nuclear - a rather pronuclear organization - writes here:&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;In practical terms, there are two different kinds of plutonium to be considered: reactor-grade and weapons-grade. The first is recovered as a by-product of typical used fuel from a nuclear reactor, after the fuel has been irradiated (&#039;burned&#039;) for about three years. The second is made specially for the military purpose, and is recovered from uranium fuel that has been irradiated for only 2-3 months in a plutonium production reactor. The two kinds differ in their isotopic composition but must both be regarded as a potential proliferation risk, and managed accordingly.&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;Wood from tree farms may be approximately carbon-neutral, but turning it into pellets takes energy… and importing wood pellets takes more. The EU may be making a mistake here.﻿

Or maybe not. &lt;/blockquote&gt;Als aready mentioned, pellets are mostly made from waste saw dust. Pelletizing it costs 4-6% of its energy content (Handbuch Bioenergie-Kleinanlagen, p.37). Pellets have several advantages: They have a much higher energy density than normal wood, they can be transported in tanks and blown through pipes, they don&#039;t rot as easy as normal wood. And they can be produced from material other than wood, e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscanthus_giganteus&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Miscanthus giganteus&lt;/a&gt; or farm waste.

Berényi Péter commented:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Burning wood cleanly is much more difficult due to its complex chemical composition. Land usage footprint of wood fired power plants is also enormous compared to alternatives (because of low flux density of sunshine and inefficiency of photosynthesis). Therefore the whole idea is ridiculous.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sorry, this comment is ridiculous: 

1) Burning wood cleanly is easy. E.g. I have a small wood gas lamp that gives a perfectly clean flame from pellets (start and ends produces smoke, however). When it burns you can have it inside instead of candles. Photos &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Experiments+in+biochar&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. 

2) Burnin wood is not an idea, but practice since ever. Germany invented sustainable forestry a long time ago: &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Carl_von_Carlowitz&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Hans Carl von Carlowitz&lt;/a&gt; (1645-1714), &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Cotta&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Heinrich Cotta&lt;/a&gt; (1763-1844). So German wood is an instantly CO2-neutral source of energy, no carbon debt for regrowing the burnt tree. 3) Not everyone needs/should burn wood.

However, the end of growth is near:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The results of the EUwood analysis [&lt;a href=&quot;http://ec.europa.eu/energy/renewables/studies/doc/bioenergy/euwood_final_report.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt;] show that, on a medium mobilisation scenario, the expected demand is likely to exceed the potential before 2020. Even if all measures for increased wood mobilisation are implemented, wood demand, from industry and to meet the renewable energy targets, can hardly be satisfied from domestic sources in 2020. This applies to Europe as a whole although the situation differs according to region and country. On the high mobilisation scenario, it is difficult, but not impossible in 2020 but not in 2030 to supply enough wood to satisfy the needs of the industry and to meet the targets for renewable energy on a sustainable basis.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some more important points:

1) There are vast areas of dying forest in the U.S. and Canada due to bark beetle infestation. You can let this wood rot (and release CO2 and CH4 in vain) or you can burn this wood.

2) Thou shalt not totally burn thy wood: Leave some charcoal and produce terra preta soil with it. This can be excellent soil, catalyzing more formation of soil organic carbon. Then you have a &lt;b&gt;carbon negative source of energy&lt;/b&gt;. (Just in case anybody is interested in survival of our civilization or even our species.)]]></description>

That&#039;s true, unfortunately. However, I am sure those people are misled.

There is a huge difference between various nuclear options and this is not communicated properly. Advanced designs can&#039;t possibly blow up like Chernobyl or melt down like Three Miles Island or Fukushima.

Also, the vast majority of nuclear power plant designs currently in operation were chosen because of their ability to manufacture Plutonium in quantity, while neither fuel efficiency nor waste quality were considered. That might have made sense during the Cold War, when our current nuclear warhead stockpiles were built up (Plutonium is excellent for that purpose), but they are becoming obsolete fast even from a strictly military point of view, as targeting accuracy has improved by several orders of magnitude lately.

No one needs that much Plutonium any more. However, if it is left in waste, those deposits are becoming Plutonium mines of the next scores of millennia, for longer than the entire written history of mankind so far. Future is obscure, but if &lt;i&gt;historia magistra vitae est&lt;/i&gt; indeed, we can be sure those sites can only be guarded for so long with huge gaps in between, when anyone with any intent can access them freely. If short half life isotopes are already gone from waste, extracting Plutonium by simple chemical means is cheap and simple.

That&#039;s a legitimate concern indeed, especially for a European generation which has grown up under prolonged nuclear threat, for Cold War military doctrines of both sides included scenarios where most of Europe gets utterly destroyed by mid range weapons while the superpowers are spared from an intercontinental exchange. I myself can remember having bad dreams about this very realistic nightmare.

It is possible to design fuel cycles where no long half life isotope is left in waste, severing the link between power generation and military applications. In that case no long term storage of waste is needed, radiation would fall back to environmental levels in several centuries, while stuff can&#039;t be weaponized at any stage. The additional benefit is improved fuel efficiency (by some two orders of magnitude!) which makes this mode of power generation sustainable indefinitely, or at least for the rest of the solar system&#039;s lifetime at acceptable cost with no prohibitively large volumes of active nuclear waste to be handled at any point in time.

It is high time to restart abandoned research projects with as little secrecy as possible. Public trust can only be regained by open communication. Regulations also have to be made targeted to mitigate weapon proliferation concerns and promoting inherent safety while opening up a wide space for private enterprise within these bounds.

Even furnaces of existing coal fired power plants could be replaced by safe nuclear modules.

Land usage footprint of this solution is less than that of any alternative by far, which is the most important point in the long run, raw land surface area being one of the two inherently scarce resources we have, for which no technological advance makes expanded reproduction possible ever (the other one is span of human attention).]]></description>

If you could make something like 30-40% of the EU&#039;s current sustainable energy using wood pellets made by just 1-2% of what forestry produces, what does that say?   Is sustainable energy production tiny, is Europe tiny, is forestry huge, or all of the above?  I should carefully check some of the numbers here.  Thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the blog post, John.

It is in general not so easy to get a good overview about issues like this.

In fact I was recently getting interested in this issue because there are currently plans for a replacement of the power plant which is in my vicinity and which moves to another place, which is also not so far away and people where concerned that it might be a biomass power plant, which might emit a lot of dust and so I checked.

There is currently at least one power plant in Berlin which runs on biomass:
 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holzheizkraftwerk_Berlin-Neukölln/Gropiusstadt&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holzheizkraftwerk_Berlin-Neukölln/Gropiusstadt&lt;/a&gt;

But the newly planned plant is actually a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_cycle&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;combined cycle&lt;/a&gt; plant. At least that&#039;s what the website of the corresponding company says:

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vattenfall.de/de/klingenberg/leistungsdaten-des-geplanten-kraftwerks-klingenberg.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.vattenfall.de/de/klingenberg/leistungsdaten-des-geplanten-kraftwerks-klingenberg.htm&lt;/a&gt;.

So it seems at least there is no overall trend in Europe to replace every plant by a wood plant.

In principle it is of course an important question whether one should burn fossil fuels (here gas), i.e. very long term accumulated solar energy  or very inefficient short term solar energy (meant here are the imported pellets, that is burning otherwise unusable waste seems rather sensible). Given its population density and northern location I guess it will be very hard to survive in Europe without any energy imports. Projects like Desertec are I think way better especially from a solar efficiency viewpoint than pellets, but there are of course political obstacles. 

That is, German company leaders (like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/unternehmen/bosch-und-siemens-deutsche-firmen-ziehen-sich-aus-desertec-zurueck-a-866819.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Bosch and Siemens&lt;/a&gt;)  have to juggle their stakeholders, even if this may appear (in my viewpoint) not very wise in a long term perspective.  Furthermore Russia needs to sell fossil fuels, because its economy is &lt;a href=&quot;http://de.rian.ru/business/20130830/266769678.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;rather dependent on that&lt;/a&gt;. The US economy by the way too. That is, a short look at this &lt;a href=&quot;http://de.rian.ru/infographiken/20130322/265772320.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;great chart&lt;/a&gt; displays, if it&#039;s correct, how the superpowers US and Russia are blasting out their oil and gas fossil fuel reserves. Here you see also that from the European countries it is apart from Russia only Norway who has a considerable gas/oil reserve.

On the other hand countries in northern Africa with a lot of sun are politically rather unstable and there seems not yet much awareness about green energies. Although there are of course initiatives like for example this  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gogreensyria.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;gogreensyria&lt;/a&gt; initiative which seems to be rather new and which seems to be located in north-west Damascus.]]></description>
