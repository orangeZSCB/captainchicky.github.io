					<description><![CDATA[Exciting all this activity on information and bio-sciences. Most likely I won&#039;t finished anything meaningful on time, but I hope knowing of it helps me make up my mind into dropping it or giving it a final push.

Laments aside, here a minuscule glitch on your text, John: The first reference has an incorrect link. Alonso&#039;s paper referred there can be downloaded from http://www-personal.umich.edu/~aostling/papers/alonso2008.pdf]]></description>

Thanks for the notification!  I&#039;m hanging out in Erlangen this spring, so I could conceivably go to that meeting... except that I&#039;ll be attending a &lt;a href=&quot;https://ihp2014.pps.univ-paris-diderot.fr/doku.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;meeting on computer science and category theory&lt;/a&gt; in Paris from May 10 to May 24!  

However, it&#039;s still good to find out names of more people working in this general area.  It has so many aspects, it seems hard to located everyone who is interested.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For various reasons we have decided to reschedule our workshop
to &lt;b&gt;Wednesday-Friday, April 8-10, 2015&lt;/b&gt;.

One reason is that on October 26-31, 2014 there will be a workshop on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.birs.ca/events/2014/5-day-workshops/14w5170&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Biological and Bio-Inspired Information Theory&lt;/a&gt; at the Banff International Research Station.

Another is that hotels in Knoxville tend to be booked for football games in the autumn!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2013/11/02/entropy-and-information-in-biological-systems/#comment-33945&quot;&gt;lee bloomquist&lt;/a&gt;.

The killing machines of Apoptosis and the deadly game that gives them birth.

The story begins a long time ago-- in PetriNetTown, the first village in the history of fabrication hives.

Death squads of roboticPetriNets roamed the paths of the village, killing all who violated the laws. They enforced the Esslaws of the death arena, at which the citizens would gather in great numbers, rewarding the winner, and best of all making sure that losers died without doubt, in fact scavenging their remains for food that could be fed back to the ever-hungry fabrication nests.

The rules are thermodynamic. According to the law, each hive may fabricate killer RoboticPetriNets (kRPN) only in strength proportional to the fabricating capability of the hive itself. In terms of the canonical fabricated system, the hive fabricating at a rate of 10 is allowed by law to fabricate kRPNs of greater capability for killing than hives fabricating at a rate of 5. 

In fact, the law holds that kRPNs fabricated from hives of rate 10 can kill systems only from hives of rate lower than 10. An kRPN fabricated by a hive of one rate can never kill systems fabricated by any higher rate hives; and may only kill systems fabricated by lower rate hives.

Without a doubt the most valuable systems fabricated by the hives are those which forage for each hive and bring it back food. Unfortunately they become easy prey for the kRPN fabricated by every higher rate hive in the arena.

Sooner or later at the amusement of the crowd, lower rate hives in the arena die and their parts are scavenged, victim of the kRPN from all higher rate hives in the arena.

At the end of the game only the highest rate hive remains-- one alone, victorious in the arena. Best of all, only its kRPN survive. The others are dead, with their parts fed back to the ever-hungry fabrication hive.

It&#039;s a stable strategy. Say that the one remaining fabrication hive makes a mistake in fabricating a system, thereby fabricating a defective system.

The laws of thermodynamics make it so that these defective systems can only perform as well as could a system fabricated by a lower rate hive.

Thereby, defective fabricated systems serve as easy bait for the survivor kRPN. Defective systems are thus killed and their parts fed back to the ever-hungry fabrication hive.

The killing machines of Apoptosis-- yet another gruesome story from thermodynamics!]]></description>
