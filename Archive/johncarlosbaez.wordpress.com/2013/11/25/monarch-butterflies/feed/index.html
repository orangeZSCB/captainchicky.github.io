Monarch decline is certainly good news. 

We are bad news, but that&#039;s hardly news really. Also I don&#039;t see any general population numbers for milkweed in the article, only information that it is much less prevalent on farmland but it doesn&#039;t follow that its total population experienced as sharp a decline as that of butterflies.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yes, I am grateful to have seen many. But recently I have not seen any.

Our house is alone in the woods within hearing distance of Lake Michigan. One spring day we went outside to sit together in the sun. There, were dozens and dozens of them flying above us in a patch of sunlight streaming through the trees. 

And they were dancing with each other-- in pairs! I watched one couple, which after a while flew apart. One of them flew to the siding on our house, moved its wings slowly after coming to a rest, and then bathed there in the sun. I watched it for a while. Suddenly it cocked its wings. Why? It&#039;s partner was flying straight toward it, out of the trees, from its own resting place in the woods. In response it lept from the siding into the air and flew straight toward its onrushing partner. They came ever so close to each other, and then danced away, together, above us in the sun.

It is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;tragedy of the commons&lt;/a&gt;. Nobody wants to see things like this destroyed. But something that nobody wants to see happen is nonetheless happening.

IMHO this is the consciousness of prosperity, manifesting prosperity, and nothing else-- specifically, being unconscious of the dignity that this kind of prosperity can take from others, and being unconscious of the peace that can exist inside a human heart, just from living on the planet Earth.

(My apologies for waxing poetic. You started it.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2013/11/25/monarch-butterflies/#comment-34106&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ian McKenzie&lt;/a&gt;---I&#039;m glad you enjoy this blog!  And I&#039;m glad to hear about Monarchs Without Borders.  Cutting for hay multiple times a year... that&#039;s the kind of thing that could have a huge effect.  How come they can do it now?  Do they get the hay to grow faster, or just cut it more often?

As for the elimination of hedgerows causing a collapse of bird populations, I&#039;ve mainly heard about that in Britain and Europe.   

&#8226; Robin McKie, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/26/eu-farming-policies-bird-population&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How EU farming policies led to a collapse in Europe&#039;s bird population&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Guardian&lt;/i&gt;, 26 May 2012.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/26/eu-farming-policies-bird-population&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/5/27/1338076166378/Bird-graphic-001.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

These grim statistics are for the whole European Union.  The article writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
This dramatic decline represents a 50% reduction and is blamed on major changes in farming policies enforced by the EU over the last 30 years.

In order to boost food production across Europe, the wholesale ripping up of hedgerows, draining of wetlands and ploughing over of meadows has robbed farmland birds of their homes and food.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The article is based on data from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ebcc.info/pecbm.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pan-European Common Bird Monitoring Scheme&lt;/a&gt;, and their website has more on bird populations.  But for more on hedgerows we have to look elsewhere, like this:

&#8226; S. A. Hinsley and P. E. Bellamy, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.formazione.unimib.it/DATA/Insegnamenti/2_501/hotfolder/Paes/Articoli/hinsley_bellamy_2000.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The influence of hedge structure, management and landscape context on the value of hedgerows to birds: a review&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Journal of Environmental Management&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;60&lt;/b&gt; (2000), 33–49.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In this review, we discuss the value of hedgerows as bird habitat in lowland-farming landscapes to provide a background against which decisions concerning hedgerow management might be evaluated. The two most important factors positively associated with species richness and abundance of breeding birds in hedgerows are hedge size (height/width/volume) and the presence/abundance of trees. The provision of cover and the botanical and structural complexity of the vegetation are also important. However, large hedges do not suit all species; birds tend to prefer hedgerow types which most closely resemble their usual non-hedgerow breeding habitat. The value of hedgerows to birds can be increased by combining them with other features such as headlands (for game birds), verges, wildflower strips, game and wild-bird cover and well-vegetated banks and ditches. The presence of well-grown, dead or decaying trees is beneficial to many species, providing nest holes, foraging sites and perches. Increasing the structural complexity of a hedgerow and its associated habitat may also reduce the incidence of predation. Hedgerows also provide physical shelter and roost sites and are an important source of winter food supplies, especially berries and other fruits. Some bird species, usually those whose primary habitat is woodland, live mainly within the hedgerow itself, whereas others are more dependent on the surrounding landscape to a greater or lesser extent. However, even the presence of woodland bird species is influenced by the availability and characteristics of alternative habitats in the surroundings and therefore hedgerows and their bird populations do not function as isolated patches.  As linear landscape elements, hedgerows also provide safe cover for both local and larger-scale movements and may facilitate access to resources or habitat which might otherwise be too risky or too remote for birds to use or colonise. A number of recommendations for improving hedgerow habitat for birds are reiterated from an extensive literature and include combining hedgerows with other semi-natural habitat, providing a variety of structural types, maintaining good cover in the hedge-base, e.g. by excluding stock and herbicide, and avoiding excessive cutting. However, good hedgerow management has costs and is unlikely to be applied widely in the absence of national policy and funding.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In England, where there&#039;s a lot of popular support for wildlife, people are trying to reverse the decline of bird populations:

&#8226; Fiona Harvey, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/17/wild-birds-uk-decline&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;UK&#039;s wild bird population continues to decline&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Guardian&lt;/i&gt;, 17 October 2013.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The number of wild birds in the UK is still falling, despite efforts to protect them by changing farming practices.

Conservationists have urged the environment secretary, Owen Paterson, to use the money newly available from the EU&#039;s common agricultural policy to step up protection measures.

Since 2003, there has been a 13% decline in the population of farmland birds. In the five years to the end of 2012, the decline was 8% overall. The decline has slowed, according to the Wild Bird Indicator statistics released by the government on Thursday, and some species are in better health than they were in the 1970s when data began to be comprehensively collected. However, conservationists are concerned that the drop in numbers is continuing, with a halving of farmland bird numbers in the past 40 years. Woodland birds are down 17%.

Turtle doves have had their lowest level of sightings since records began. Lapwings are down by nearly two thirds since 1970, while corn buntings are down nine-tenths in the same period, and the number of skylarks is down by well over half.

But jackdaw numbers have gone up by 140% since 1970, and the increasingly common woodpigeon is up by a similar amount.

Farmland birds suffer from intensive agriculture, as farmers often remove or drastically cut back the hedges and trees where many of them live, while pesticides can leave them with less prey, and a lack of wild field margins cuts down on habitats.

There are some government-sponsored schemes to encourage farmers to make room for wildlife, for instance by leaving field margins wild, cutting down on pesticide and artificial fertiliser use, and leaving some areas fallow or pasture. There are also strict laws against killing rare birds of prey, but conservationists think these are frequently flouted.

Martin Harper, conservation director at the RSPB bird charity, said: &quot;The trend for farmland birds continues to go downwards. The decline has slowed, and wildlife friendly farmers who put conservation measures in place on their land must be congratulated for their hard work. But if we are all going to work together to bring wildlife back to our countryside, then the funding must be there for these measures to continue.&quot;

Under the reforms to the common agricultural policy, which were agreed this summer, the government has the ability to divert some of the millions of pounds of funds available – which come ultimately from taxpayers – to environmental stewardship schemes to reward farmers for good practice.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/17/wild-birds-uk-decline&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/17/1382024193261/birds_farmland18-10-2013.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The environment secretary, Owen Paterson, has still not said how he intends to allocate the funding, which could go up to 15% of the agricultural subsidies budget. But given the government&#039;s freedom of action under the new rules, much of it could go to farmers based not on their practices but on the amount of land they farm, as other subsidies are.

A decision is expected before the end of the year, and green groups are concerned that the amount devoted to environmental measures will not be enough to halt further declines in wildlife numbers. &quot;Without Owen Paterson&#039;s help, farmland wildlife will continue to struggle, along with those farmers trying to help,&quot; said Harper.

A Defra spokeswoman said: &quot;Agri-environment schemes play a vital part in providing benefits for wildlife and will continue to be an essential element of the next rural development programme.&quot;

I hate it too.  Vote for politicians who care about the environment, help lobbies who pressure the politicians to do the right things, and tear out your lawn and grow plants that birds and insects like---those are some of the main things we can do.]]></description>

Several things...

Dawson College in Montreal, where I teach, is involved in a program called Monarchs Without Borders, run by the Jardin Botanique de Montreal -- it gets people involved in raising and tagging caterpillars/butterflies.  Great idea and program

Participants who tag successfully are in fact contributing to research run out of the U of Kansas by Chip Taylor -- see http://www.monarchwatch.org/

Re: &quot;reduction of hedgerows&quot; -- do you have a source on that?  I too recall reading something somewhere on this topic.  In my rural childhood (in southern Ontario) all the fields were 5-10 acre units marked off by thick hedgerows of that harboured all kinds of trees, plants, birds &#038; critters.  With the vanishing of the smaller family farms and the elimination of garden crops by (you said it) corn, the hedgerows disappeared.  Easier driving the big combine; too bad the top soil blows away faster.

Another factor in reduced bird populations is apparently cutting for hay multiple times over the growing season versus once or twice as was once the case.  Where ground nesting species once had a chance to reproduce before the mid-to-late summer haying, now the bigger fields are cut early and often, 4 or 5 times, by rotary mowers.  They skip the baling and blow it right into trucks to be hauled off to the feedlots. 

Always enjoy dropping in on your blog John! Sustainability needs a healthy, expanding population of math nerds...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I hate this.  We used to have so many of them cover over our area and we had only  a handful this year.  What a tragedy.  They are such awesome butterflies and the journey they make twice a year is of epic proportions.  So sad.  Natalie :(]]></description>
