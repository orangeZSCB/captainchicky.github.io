					<description><![CDATA[I had independently come upon the term &quot;meta-rational&quot;, but with a quite different meaning than Cowen and Hanson&#039;s. If we understand the difference between ethics and meta-ethics - ethics being theories about what actually is right or wrong, meta-ethics being theories about what it means to call something right or wrong - then by analogy, rationality would be theories about what is actually rational or irrational, and meta-rationality would be theories about what it means to call something (an argument, a belief, a person) rational or irrational. Just as meta-ethics addresses the question of what objective grounding, if any, ethical judgements have, in the same way meta-rationality must grapple with the question of what objective grounding, if any, judgements about rationality have. Another classic example of a meta-rational question is whether epistemic rationality and instrumental reality are fundamentally the same thing, or fundamentally distinct things? (see http://www.princeton.edu/~tkelly/papers/epistemicasinstrumental.pdf ) By contrast, a question like &quot;Is Lord Monckton&#039;s belief, that &#039;there is no significant anthropogenic contribution to climate change&#039;, rational?&quot; is not a meta-rational question, it is a rational question.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;I could imagine that the ability to desist from one’s own viewpoints, if they are clearly wrong (…and this is of course also debateable) is linked to the emotional intelligence of the person and its environment.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For completeness I want to add that of course if a person constantly changes his/her mind regarding relevant questions then this may of course also be problematic - even if the mind change may not happen out of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunism&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;opportunism.&lt;/a&gt;

Unfortunately - especially politicians - are often pressured into making final decisions that is a longer period of fact search and argument weighing may often be mistaken as indecisiveness by the public. This may lead to premature decisions, which especially if these were decisions with regard to relevant questions with immediate consequences may be hard to revise.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2013/03/15/meta-rationality/#comment-26830&quot;&gt;Arrow&lt;/a&gt;.

Thank you for writing this so I didn&#039;t have to. Developing evidence is hard work, and many an important discovery has come out of an &quot;I&#039;ll show them&quot; mentality. Furthermore, assessing evidence is cognitively costly, so recruiting the motivated reasoning, debate-winning part of the brain can be a powerful way to unearth flaws in others&#039; reasoning. 

Self-deception problems can then be addressed by a dialectical debating process witnessed by a passive audience whose motivation is being right rather than being seen to have been right.

My short tagline for this line of reasoning is &quot;disinterested is uninterested.&quot; (It works better for older people who recall that usage distinction.)]]></description>

But testing predictions is hardly an assumption-free process. 

Even allowing for personal or financial bias, it&#039;s pretty damn hard to get definitive data about certain kinds of research from empirical testing. 

While we&#039;d all like to live in a perfect empirical world, the reality is that some experiments or fields aren&#039;t funded or investigated for political or ideological reasons, or because they&#039;re academically unfashionable, or because it&#039;s too expensive to investigate them properly, or because it takes too long to collect the data.

The other issue is that politics is driven by rhetoric and power, not fact. It&#039;s perfectly possible to have the most ridiculous multiply-falsified nonsense driving policy if you spend enough money on promoting it.

Pretty much everything in economic theory as practiced by Western governments has worked like this since at least the 1970s. The causes and remedies for recessions and depressions aren&#039;t a mystery. But because policy is owned by people who benefit hugely from denying the truth, and because democracy is rhetorical not rational, those in power continue to destroy both collective wealth and collective intelligence for petty personal gain.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Robotic Petri nets 3: 
Apoptosis

Class content

It&#039;s well known how to capture programmed cell death i.e., &quot;apoptosis,&quot; in terms of Petri nets.

The virtue of remodeling apoptosis in terms of robotic Petri nets (as would be well understood by the imagined graduates of Petri nets 1 and 2 :)  is that a robotic Petri net engineer knows how to &quot;know for one&#039;s self&quot; how to generate mathematical theorems about robotic Petri nets using Haskell.

We should expect that the imagined robotic Petri net engineers will find agreement with each other over theorems as much as mathematicians now find agreement with each other over theorems.

Next: remodeling apoptosis in terms of robotic Petri nets brings to bear a fresh mathematical tool in the attack against the diseases now associated with apoptosis run amok, like cancer. 

When robotic Petri nets get involved, theorems about those robotic Petri nets (written in Haskell) get involved. 

It might be a new role in the world for theorem proving.

 
Computer lab:

Convert a given Petri net model of apoptosis into an animation performed by robotic Petri nets. Prove theorems about the animation using the functional programming language Haskell.]]></description>
