					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2013/03/22/the-planck-mission/#comment-27039&quot;&gt;Arrow&lt;/a&gt;.

If by &quot;far-fetched speculations&quot; you&#039;re talking about the explanations proposed &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMB_cold_spot#Possible_causes_other_than_primordial_temperature_fluctuation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;on the Wikipedia page about the cold spot&lt;/a&gt;, here&#039;s what I have to say.  

1)  The possibility that it&#039;s a due to a supervoid (an unusually large reason with few galaxies).  This doesn&#039;t seem particularly far-fetched, since it sounds like the supervoid would only need to be 10 times bigger in diameter than existing voids... and I&#039;d to know a lot more about cosmology than I do to guess which is more unlikely: a void this big arising due purely to coincidence, or a fluctuation in the microwave background that&#039;s even bigger, again arising due purely to coincidence.  

Either way, I&#039;d want to inquire into possible mechanisms that could generate such big fluctuations &lt;i&gt;non&lt;/i&gt;coincidentally.  And that leads us to the next option:

2) The possibility that such a big fluctuation is due to a &#039;cosmic texture&#039;, a remnant of a phase transition in the early Universe.  Textures, or more generally &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_defect&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;topological defects&lt;/a&gt;, are things that arise in a lot of quantum field theories (and also condensed matter physics).   In my post I already suggested the idea of processes occurring before or during the inflationary epoch, that could create fluctuations which then get &#039;blown up&#039; to enormous sizes.  A topological defect is the kind of thing that might do the job.   The physics ideas have already been worked out, and they&#039;re waiting to be applied to this kind of problem.  

So, this seems like an line of thought worth exploring.  That&#039;s what Neil Turok (director of the Perimeter Institute) and coauthors are trying to in this paper:

&#8226; M. Cruz, N. Turok, P. Vielva, E. Martinez-Gonzalez and M. Hobson, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/0710.5737&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;A Cosmic Microwave Background feature consistent with a cosmic texture&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract.&lt;/b&gt; The Cosmic Microwave Background provides our most ancient image of the Universe and our best tool for studying its early evolution. Theories of high energy physics predict the formation of various types of topological defects in the very early universe, including cosmic texture which would generate hot and cold spots in the Cosmic Microwave Background. We show through a Bayesian statistical analysis that the most prominent, 5 degree radius cold spot observed in all-sky images, which is otherwise hard to explain, is compatible with having being caused by a texture. From this model, we constrain the fundamental symmetry breaking energy scale to be &#966;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ~ 8.7 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; GeV. If confirmed, this detection of a cosmic defect will probe physics at energies exceeding any conceivable terrestrial experiment. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

3) Laura Mersini-Houghton&#039;s idea that it could be the &quot;imprint of another universe beyond our own, caused by quantum entanglement between universes before they were separated by cosmic inflation.&quot;  This seems goofy to me, at least at first glance, for quite a number of reasons.  For one thing, I don&#039;t see how quantum entanglement could have this effect.]]></description>

I am thinking to an analysis of cold spot description.
There is a simple discrimination between a curvature bubble near the Big Bang (cosmic ripple or a high density zone), and an asimmetric Big Bang.
A statistical study of the density of optical galaxies near the cold spot can distinguish the two theories: if there is not density difference in simultaneous galaxies then the Big Bang is uniform (curvature ball), if there is an inhomogeneity in the galaxies distribution then the Big Bang is inhomogeneous.
The density variation (of the galaxies) in the time can give an information of the curvature ball, or the inhomogeneities in the Big Bang; this reminds me the Liouville&#039;s theorem where we see section of the flow in different times.

Hi John. Subtraction of foregrounds is obviously an issue to be concerned about. However, a lot of careful work has been done on this, so if there are still some foreground effects present, they will have some odd properties. Planck scans the sky in a much wider range of frequencies than WMAP, which makes it better placed to detect foreground sources emitting with a non-blackbody spectrum.

Regarding Jester&#039;s comment about the alignment with the ecliptic, you might be interested in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://telescoper.wordpress.com/2013/03/21/planck-pointillism-and-the-axle-of-elvis/#comment-65734&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;opinion&lt;/a&gt; of Hans Kristian Eriksen, one of the authors of the Planck papers.

Finally, when I say the anomalies individually are not particularly odd, I mean that in the standard $latex \Lambda$CDM model they are only discrepant at around the 3$latex \sigma$ level, or odds of 1 in 100. At that level, they&#039;re odd enough to remark on, but unless someone can come up with an alternative model which can explain them, they may ultimately be nothing more than curiosities, simply the effect of finite sampling of a random variable.

If you want a different take on the anomalies, you could read the WMAP paper &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1001.4758&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&quot;Are there cosmic microwave background anomalies?&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, which draws very different conclusions from essentially the same data.]]></description>

That Jester quote says &quot;the quadrupole mode in the fluctuation spectrum is aligned with the ecliptic plane&quot;. I read a few press reports about the overall story, and just one of them said the hemispheric anomaly is aligned with the plane of the ecliptic (i.e. of the orbit of the earth around the sun). None of the others addressed its alignment. Can you confirm this more directly? If true, it seems to me very significant and the other press reports ought to point it out more strongly. (Whether it&#039;s an error or new physics, it opens up an additional &quot;more local&quot; set of explanations to look for.)

Related questions: how well aligned is it? (And how precise an orientation can be defined from this data?) Is there anything else outside our solar system that happens to have the same alignment?]]></description>

I&#039;m not against studying those fluctuations, I am against preferring some far-fetched speculative explanation invoking quantum fluctuations and inflation to simply ascribing them to an initial state. 

It&#039;s a matter of taste I guess. However if someone come up with an explanation with a better &quot;explained to postulated&quot; ratio I&#039;d certainly be interested.]]></description>
