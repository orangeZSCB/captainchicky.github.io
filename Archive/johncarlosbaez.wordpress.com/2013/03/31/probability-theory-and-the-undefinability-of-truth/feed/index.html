Probabilities (or rather, events in a probability space) really are elements of a boolean lattice as are most spaces stable under intersection, union and complement, but I&#039;m not sure my suggestion isn&#039;t junk, as I don&#039;t think the &quot;classical&quot; point of view brings much more to the table than the usual analysis of modal logic in S4.]]></description>

I agree that it would be great to connect the two concepts as precisely as possible.  Are probabilities really elements of a Boolean lattice?  Or did you mean something else?  I&#039;m getting a bit confused...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s another way to show that $latex P$ is uncomputable in general: suppose $latex \phi$ is the sentence that expresses &quot;the Turing machine $latex T$ halts on empty input&quot;. Then if $latex P(\phi)$ if not zero or one, the machine $latex T$ does not halt! This is clearly undecidable in general.

I think this work is interesting! My question is this: what is the difference with working with a probabilistic assignment of truth and the more &quot;standard&quot; provability predicate? It seems that both assign a value to each sentence into some (boolean) lattice. Is there a way of connecting both points of view?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It is a my great mistake: I don&#039;t know if each mathematical theorem can be represented like a boolean net (this is the 	muddle), with nodes of propositions and axioms, so that the Godel&#039;s incompleteness theorems can be solved with a quantum computer.
Thank you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I thought that each mathematical demonstration can be translate in boolean algebra, the boolean net can be transformed in an electronic circuit, if the truth table of the circuit is constant then the demonstration have not inconsistencies; but it exist the flip flop, in the electronic, that have not a constant value, so that the boolean algebra can be inconsistent.
If the value of the truth of a sentence is a spin value (spin up and down), then with a quantum computer there is not more inconsistence, because there is a quantum value for each node of the net, and it is possible deduce theorem from flip flop outputs: there is an overlap between boolean net (without incongruence) and quantum spin net (the truth tables are the same).
The boolean net have two state of truth, with an oscillation between the two state, but I am thinking that the quantum computer have a single quantum equilibrium state for a boolean net, and there is not more incongruence (intermediate values).]]></description>
