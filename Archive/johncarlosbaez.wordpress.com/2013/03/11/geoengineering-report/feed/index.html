&quot;Now imagine that, say, the climate were to change imperceptibly for decades or centuries. The noise in the signal would mask the trend to the extent that it would be easy to doubt— and cast doubt on—the overall trend.&quot;

&quot;Creep and its ramifications, such as weight gain and climate change, suggest that we might need to worry about what happens at low fre- quency.&quot;

...In structural  mechanics creep is very much an important indication of an impending failure of a system. 
&quot;It is&quot; very slow initially, almost imperceptibly, and in many documented disasters it was often initially dismissed as just a worrysome crack in the structure that was only even noticeable over a period of time. 
Unfortunately the ensuing failure mode is also very well understood, at least in mechanics, &quot;to be exponential&quot; and can be very dangerous and even potentially catastrophic. 
I&#039;ve experienced creep first hand in experimental structures and I did experience a catastophic collapse of a structure as it was in creep. We were foolishly working inside trying to stabilize it as it was shifting, I finally sensed something was very wrong so finally, we quit and left it.  Later... in the early morning...it collapsed completely and catastrophically. It&#039;s very fortunate that no one was hurt because a sturdy step ladder that was left inside was crushed flat onto the floor.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I’ve noticed that if I were to gain a mere 0.2 lb per month, then that weight gain would be extremely hard to measure
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the context of AGW, I think one can extend the analogy. My reasoning would be like this: suppose we eat every day one more cookie (say, 15 kcal -- compare to increase in radiative forcing induced by CO2). Everything else, food intake, activity... remains the same, on average. Then, we would expect, our body mass would slowly rise (&#039;temperature&#039;). Yet, our body is also a complex feedback system. Now comes a skeptical argument: suppose we eat every day more vegetables (say, also 15 kcal). Do we really expect our body mass to increase with the same amount? The complex feedback system of our body may not react in the same manner. PS I don&#039;t think the latter analogy holds, because vegetables carry e.g. fibres (which certainly affect our body feedback system) whereas carbon dioxide is inert and only has an influence through the radiative forcing (AFAIK).]]></description>

Nice passage.  And the frustrating thing is that what counts as slow climate change by human standard can still be dangerously abrupt by geological standards. You&#039;ve probably seen this graph by now, since I&#039;ve been dwelling on it, along with everyone else (click for details):

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/07/scientists-find-an-abrupt-warm-jog-after-a-very-long-cooling/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ecological/marcott_paleoclimate.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; 

Truly gradual climate change is something we, and ecosystems as a whole, can probably manage to adapt to without much damage.  But the world&#039;s climate changing by a degree or more per century for several centuries may turn out to be quite tough.  We&#039;ll see.]]></description>

Yes. It is not trivial to regulate a system that has dynamics falling outside the bandwidth of your sensors. Which reminds me of something i&#039;ve read once.

Here it is, you might have some fun reading just the last couple of paragraphs of &lt;a href=&quot;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&#038;arnumber=4939300&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this letter&lt;/a&gt; from Dennis Bernstein.

I&#039;ll quote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I’ve noticed that if I were to gain a mere 0.2 lb per month, then that weight gain would be extremely hard to measure much less regulate. Each day my weight would fluctuate by an order of magnitude beyond that monthly delta. Viewing that fluctuation as noise, the signal—weight gain—would be extremely difficult to detect. But consider the effect of the signal: In a mere 20 years, I would gain 48 lb, which, obviously, is a substantial amount.

This isn’t exactly “creep” in the sense of structural mechanics, but you get the point. 

Now imagine that, say, the climate were to change imperceptibly for decades or centuries. The noise in the signal would mask the trend to the extent that it would be easy to doubt—and cast doubt on—the overall trend. Creep and its ramifications, such as weight gain and climate change, suggest that we might need to worry about what happens at low frequency.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

I&#039;m getting more optimistic every year, esp. since the U.S. is getting ever more hard hit by reality. Superstorm Sandy wasn&#039;t enough yet, and drought stricken U.S. farmers aren&#039;t yet committing suicide - but I expect Wall Street flooded by another Sandy within a decade or two. Plus, a new Dust Bowl seems near. Who cares about Pakistan 2009/10 or a few baked and douched Australians or the odd Syrian farmer etc. etc. -- but Wall Street! That will be a wet wake-up... Current development in the Arctic Ocean (early cracking of ice) suggests we are in for another record melt, amplifying probability of weird weather events.]]></description>

But if the problems worsen—and I can’t see why they won’t—public opinion may at some point suddenly ‘tip’ to a new consensus.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yes, indeed it might. Or, instead, if the worsening happens over a long enough time, all those disasters might be regarded just as a &quot;fact of life&quot;, or as some kind of &quot;new normal&quot; for people that still remember the &quot;old normal&quot;.

Also keep in mind that many populations near the equators (which arguably would be the most affected) tend to have a culture that is more present-oriented and less inclined to believe that one can actually affect even simple things in the future, let alone natural disasters.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I very much doubt sea level rise will ever make global warming be seen as a real and present threat. After all, it tends to happen gradually, barring possible catastrophes like a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Antarctic_Ice_Sheet#Potential_collapse&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;runaway collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet&lt;/a&gt;, which conceivably could raise sea levels by 3.3 meters in a fairly short time.  Far more likely, it seems to me, is that droughts and heat waves will cause crop failures and famines, and storms will knock out coastal cities here and there, more and more often, until it causes enough disruption that people take notice.

It could already be starting: in 2010, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Northern_Hemisphere_summer&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;heat wave throughout the Northern Hemisphere&lt;/a&gt; caused Russia to suspend grain exports.  In 2011, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought_in_the_United_States#2010s&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;drought hit the Midwestern  United States&lt;/a&gt;, hurting grain production, and this has still not ended.  A lot of New Orleans, and large parts of New York City have been severely damaged by powerful hurricanes.  And so on.  

Apparently not many people believe yet that there&#039;s a pattern and that we should resort to geoengineering to &#039;fix&#039; the climate.  After all, it&#039;s still possible to believe these events are unrelated coincidences.  And not many people know about geoengineering.

But if the problems worsen---and I can&#039;t see why they won&#039;t---public opinion may at some point suddenly &#039;tip&#039; to a new consensus.  When disasters happen often enough, people may want to do something about it.  And if so, they&#039;ll probably want to do something that doesn&#039;t require changes in their personal behavior.

A lot of New Orleans, and large parts of New York City have been severely damaged by powerful hurricanes.  And so on.  </p>
<p>Apparently not many people believe yet that there&#8217;s a pattern and that we should resort to geoengineering to &#8216;fix&#8217; the climate.  After all, it&#8217;s still possible to believe these events are unrelated coincidences.  And not many people know about geoengineering.</p>
<p>But if the problems worsen&#8212;and I can&#8217;t see why they won&#8217;t&#8212;public opinion may at some point suddenly &#8216;tip&#8217; to a new consensus.  When disasters happen often enough, people may want to do something about it.  And if so, they&#8217;ll probably want to do something that doesn&#8217;t require changes in their personal behavior.</p>
