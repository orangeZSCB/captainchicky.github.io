I see you misunderstood me, when I wondered &quot;how did they come up with that?&quot; I meant how IPCC managed to turn numerous contradictory sensitivity estimates reported in the literature into the likelihoods they quote for particular sensitivity ranges. For example how did they come up with the 66% number you quoted for climate sensitivity being in 2-4.5C range. Hence my followup but I did manage to find the answer to that question in the report.

Anyway if we were to focus on one issue then by far the most fundamental disagreement we have is about climate models. As I said many times before, I consider all global climate models to be simplistic, inadequate and completely unreliable. This immediately invalidates most of the climate science which is based on them. I find both arguments from authority and from consensus completely empty and unpersuasive, the only thing that matters to me is empirical evidence.

To change my opinion about climate models I would have to see numerous long term (many decades) climate predictions based on them turn out to be correct. I doubt it will happen during my lifetime.

You seem to believe climate models and their predictions are trustworthy. What I would like to know is what makes you think so? And to be sure, neither the fact that many very smart people try their best to make them correct nor the fact that models are based on correct physics count. Biology is the best proof of that if you needed one. Neither very smart people nor the correct physics count for much when it comes to modelling the complexity of life, and I am sure the same holds for climate. The only difference is that in the case of life experiments make our ignorance immediately obvious to us.]]></description>

The section you linked to has nothing relevant...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch8s8-6.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;section I linked to&lt;/a&gt; is the introduction to chapter 8.6, &quot;Climate Sensitivity and Feedbacks&quot;, in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report: Climate Change 2007.  You were wondering how the IPCC came up with estimates of climate sensitivity.   Reading this chapter---not just the introduction---would be the way to find out.

I wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

Second of all, you shouldn&#039;t neglect the possibility that CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is responsible for &lt;i&gt;more than 100%&lt;/i&gt; of the observed warming.  In fact there&#039;s a growing consensus that this is the case:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.skepticalscience.com/a-comprehensive-review-of-the-causes-of-global-warming.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The point is that human sulfur dioxide (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) emissions have a cooling effect, while greenhouse gases (GHG) have a warming effect.  So, it seems roughly 100--170% of global warming is due to our greenhouse gases, mainly CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  Click the figure for more details.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Arrow wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and then:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The relevant part of your link is this: “However, because aerosols have a number of different effects (including directly by blocking sunlight, and indirectly by seeding clouds, which both block sunlight and increase the greenhouse effect), the magnitude of their cooling effect is one of the biggest remaining uncertainties in climate science.”
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That&#039;s nothing new: that&#039;s the &lt;i&gt;reason&lt;/i&gt; people estimate the climate sensitivity as lying between 1.5 &#176;C and 4.5 &#176; C, instead of giving a more narrow range of figures.   If I were claiming climate sensitivity were accurately known, you&#039;d be right to bring that up.  But I didn&#039;t: I was just claiming that there&#039;s a growing consensus that greenhouse gases contribute more than 100% of the observed global warming, while other factors, such as SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and other aerosols, bring this down to the observed figure.  This is compatible with the current uncertainty in climate sensitivity.

Your new comment raises even more issues, but I don&#039;t have time to respond to all of them right now.  It would be great if you could dig down to the actual science, and focus in on one issue at a time, instead of making rapid-fire criticisms in many directions at once.   We could make a lot more progress understanding the subject that way.]]></description>

John: &quot;Since all this information is free online, this is something you can easily read about.&quot;
Is it? The section you linked to has nothing relevant although the summary of it is notable &quot;a set of model metrics that might be used to narrow the range of plausible climate change feedbacks and climate sensitivity has yet to be developed&quot;.

However the Box 1.1 in section 1 has among others the following to say about likelyhood estimates: &quot;Structural uncertainties are generally described by giving the authors’ collective judgment of their confidence in the correctness of a result.&quot;
http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch1s1-6.html
So basically the authors state how confident they are in their results... How objective do you think are such self-assesments? The permanently inflated reaction yields in chemistry come to mind, and in chemistry, unlike in climate science, there is a pretty straightforward way to experimentally verify such claims. 

The confidence values of various sensitivity estimates I already linked to are a good illustration of how well such self-assesments agree with each other (they don&#039;t). Averaging diverging guesstimates doesn&#039;t improve our knowledge, it&#039;s the emperor of China&#039;s nose fallacy.

John: &quot;Again, I gave you a link that takes you to the actual papers. You need to read this stuff to assess it. It’s cheap and easy to be skeptical without looking at the evidence.&quot;

The relevant part of your link is this: &quot;However, because aerosols have a number of different effects (including directly by blocking sunlight, and indirectly by seeding clouds, which both block sunlight and increase the greenhouse effect), the magnitude of their cooling effect is one of the biggest remaining uncertainties in climate science.&quot;

And in any case all those papers you mention are based on simplistic climate models which have yet to prove they can simulate anything properly. To me such evidence is worthless. The physics is fine, but knowing the relevant physics doesn&#039;t mean we can reliably simulate global climate just as knowing the relevant physics is not enough to reliably simulate living cells or even folding of single proteins!.]]></description>

You give no evidence for this shockingly optimistic claim.

Forget about exact climate sensitivity. planet3.org has 2 nice graphs based on the latest hockey stick quoted by John: An &quot;alarmist graph&quot; and a &quot;lukewarmers&#039; graph&quot;: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Given that this change still takes us well outside the experience of humanity in range, and well outside the normal experience of the biosphere in rapidity, such an outcome offers no grounds for complacency. And the data themselves plainly argue against a sensitivity smaller than that.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

OK, thanks for the correction, I missed that.

So the value of 1.5C would make our emissions account for a bit more then half the warming. Still we don&#039;t really know what the actual sensitivity is. Personally I don&#039;t find IPCC likelyhood estimates trustworthy (how did they come up with them anyway? Also &quot;better then 66%&quot; is only somewhat better then a coin toss).

Yes, the sensitivity could also be pretty high with the warming being masked by other factors but again there is simply no way to tell if this is the case. Appeals to a growing consensus are not convincing to me.

As for the burning of the remaining fossil fuels I don&#039;t see why we should be scared - another 1.8 °C of warming by 2100 seems entirely managable and even an extra 2.7 wouldn&#039;t be a catastrophe. Sure there would be winners and losers (as always) but humanity could certainly adopt. I would be way more scared if we were to run out of cheap fossil fuels soon. That would immediately result in a steep decline in living standards for me and almost everyone else and likely destabilise large regions of the planet.]]></description>

<p>OK, thanks for the correction, I missed that.</p>

During the last 100 years CO2 increased from 300ppm to 385ppm, so 85ppm or 28% of the doubling. Assuming sensitivity of 1.5C per doubling gives us 0.42C, assuming sensitivity of 4.5C gives us 1.27C, the actual temperature increase in this period was 1C. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There&#039;s a math mistake here.  The idea of climate sensitivity is that temperature increases logarithmically with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration.  The &lt;b&gt;climate sensitivity&lt;/b&gt; is the temperature increase per doubling of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. But to see &#039;what fraction of a doubling&#039; we get by going from 300 ppm to 385 ppm, here&#039;s what we do.

First we take the ratio

$latex 385/300 = 1.28 \dots$

Then we take its logarithm using base 2:

$latex \log_2(1.28) = \ln(1.28)/\ln(2) = 0.36$

So, we get 0.36 of a doubling, not 0.28 as you said.  

If the climate sensitivity is 1.5 &#176;C per doubling, that gives 0.54 &#176;C.  If the climate sensitivity is 4.5 &#176;C per doubling, that gives 1.62 &#176;C.   

If the temperature actually went up 1 &#176;C during the last 100 years, and all the temperature increase were due to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, this would correspond to a climate sensitivity during 2.8 &#176;C per doubling.]]></description>

I am not demanding many decimal places but stating that the climate sensitivity is most likely between 1.5C and 4.5C per CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; doubling is almost equivalent to my statement above that it is impossible to tell if our emissions are responsible for most of the warming or only a small fraction of it.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

You made a math mistake (see my next comment), so where you said &quot;small fraction&quot; you should have said &quot;half&quot;.

But I made a mistake too: my statement was out of date.  In 2001, the IPCC Third Assessment Report judged that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_sensitivity&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;climate sensitivity&lt;/a&gt; was likely to be between 1.5 &#176;C and 4.5 &#176;C.  In 2007, the Fourth Assessment Report said the climate sensitivity is 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
likely to be in the range 2 to 4.5 °C with a best estimate of about 3 °C, and is very unlikely to be less than 1.5 °C. Values substantially higher than 4.5 °C cannot be excluded, but agreement of models with observations is not as good for those values
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the earlier report, &quot;likely&quot; was not defined.  In the more recent report, &quot;likely&quot; means &quot;greater than 66% chance of being correct&quot;, while &quot;very unlikely&quot; means &quot;less than a 10% chance of being correct&quot;.

A lot of work has been put into ruling out very high climate sensitivities.  As time passes, we&#039;ll continue to narrow down the estimate.  

Second of all, you shouldn&#039;t neglect the possibility that CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is responsible for &lt;i&gt;more than 100%&lt;/i&gt; of the observed warming.  In fact there&#039;s a growing consensus that this is the case:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.skepticalscience.com/a-comprehensive-review-of-the-causes-of-global-warming.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;http://www.skepticalscience.com/pics/Contrib100-150.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The point is that human sulfur dioxide (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) emissions have a cooling effect, while greenhouse gases (GHG) have a warming effect.  So, it seems roughly 100--170% of global warming is due to our greenhouse gases, mainly CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  Click the figure for more details.

Third, we can see that rapid human-caused warming is overcoming a long-term cooling trend:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/07/scientists-find-an-abrupt-warm-jog-after-a-very-long-cooling/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ecological/marcott_paleoclimate.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; 

Again, click for details.  

Third, even if you believe in the low-end figure of 1.5 &#176;C of warming for each doubling of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, you should be scared, since you say that humans will burn all the easily available carbon.    So far, through the course of history, humans have put about &lt;a href=&quot;http://trillionthtonne.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;567 gigatonnes of carbon&lt;/a&gt; into the atmosphere.  But the remaining proven reserves of carbon total about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.carbontracker.org/carbonbubble&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;2800 gigatonnes&lt;/a&gt;.  We can estimate what the effects would be, and they&#039;re not pretty.  

For example: so far we&#039;re following the scenario where we &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ipcc-data.org/ddc_co2.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;don&#039;t limit carbon emissions and we hit 1000 ppm of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by 2100.  It doesn&#039;t take anything close to burning all available carbon to do this!   This would mean about 1.8 doublings from the pre-industrial value of 280 ppm.  With the ultra-optimistic figure of 1.5 &#176;C climate sensitivity, that gives 2.8 &#176;C warming.  But with the best-guess figure of 2 &#176;C climate sensitivity, that&#039;s 3.7 &#176;C warming.

If you look at the climate history graph again, you&#039;ll see that even 2.8&#176;C warming between the industrial revolution and 2100 would be an astounding event.  It would blast right through the roof here:
