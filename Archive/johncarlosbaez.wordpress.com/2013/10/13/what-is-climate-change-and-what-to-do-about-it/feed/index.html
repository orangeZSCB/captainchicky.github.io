Dear Konstantin, I receive such e-meils from Azimuth - a Mathematician John Baez is there. They resolve global problems (climate changes) in an exact way. I didn&#039;t read them. Hope you will find some new ideas, global as well. I am going to read them as well. M

This looks like an interesting model, WebHubTel.  I&#039;ve only looked at it a little bit.  Have you tried using just some of the data to fit the parameters and then tried to &#039;predict&#039; (retrodict) the temperature based on that?  Maybe you&#039;re already doing that, I can&#039;t tell yet.  For example, maybe you&#039;re using 1880-1960 data to fit the parameters and then &#039;predicting&#039; the 1960-now temperature.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am thinking that climate change is that is a problem of only a political part, and this is not true.
The governments changes, and the problem remains.
The view of the people is that the climate change is a political left problem, that give more taxes and constraints, so that the persons are less free.
The occidental countries depend on other countries for energy source: in these countries the sun energy was trasformed in energy source (oil, gas, coal).
I think that in some years the performance of the solar, and wind, domestic plants can give energy for drive a car, or for domestic use, or for industrial use, without cost: no tax to the country (I produce, I use); there is a complete freedom, that is a political right fight, but also a fight of hippies.
We can start before of others countries in the technological research to obtain free energy (solar energy converted in winds, tides,organic carbon,biocarburant) for all (low cost and without taxes), and I think this is inevitable, and this can be only slowed politically.]]></description>

John, thanks, I will read the paper when I can get access to it. They do appear to cover the two significant issues of fracked shale wells  --

&lt;i&gt;
&quot;Shale developments are, so we believe, largely overrated, because of the huge amounts of financial resources that went into them (danger of bubble) and because of their apparent steep decline rates (shale wells tend to peak fast),&quot; according to Dr. Kerschner.
&lt;/i&gt;]]></description>

I won&#039;t try to play economist---not in the next week, anyway!  

Here are two famous reports on the economics of climate change that you can read for free. Needless to say, people disagree wildly.

&#8226; &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Stern+Review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2006.

&#8226; William D. Nordhaus, &lt;a href=&quot;http://nordhaus.econ.yale.edu/Balance_2nd_proofs.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Question of Balance: Weighing the Options on Global Warming Policies&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Yale University Press, New Haven, 2008.

I&#039;m trying to collect writings of this sort on the Azimuth Wiki.  People can read them and add more to our collection here:

I know you don&#039;t want to lose your audience by getting too technical, but if you can find time in your first talk to briefly allude to this as well as the fact that there are really interesting mathematical issues around the definition of a &quot;phase transition&quot; I think that would be great.
P.S. Perhaps you should demand extra time as you are now wearing (at the latest count) 5 hats: math, stats, physics, biology, and (see below) economics (but at least I think you can save that last one for the second talk).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Notable is the lack of any expert on economists on the panel.  Yes, there&#039;s a political scientist, but that&#039;s a different beast.

The point of climate change is human misery and suffering, which we currently measure in mostly economic terms.  So, we have models that predict meters of sea-level rise, but I can&#039;t say I&#039;ve seen any estimates of economic impact.  Yes, if Bangladesh goes under-water, there will be war; the political scientist can tell you that.

But what about tedious, mundane things: loss of fisheries, disruption to farming (e.g see Australia in recent decades)  Water scarcity issues in American southwest, and the economic impact of that.  

Yes, all this can be hotly debated, and economists are often woefully wrong; but they do know the sizes of things, measured in money -- no one else does.  This is the background needed for discussing &quot;global economic collapse&quot;.

I doubt you&#039;re able to play economist-and-mathematician; but who can?]]></description>
