					<description><![CDATA[I just finished Arne Naess&#039;s &lt;i&gt; Ecology, Community, Lifestyle&lt;/i&gt; (1990) -- and this analogy late in the book might be valuable to you in the context of your remarks on the Anthropocene:

&quot;Mankind during the last nine thousand years has conducted itself like a &lt;i&gt;pioneer invading species.&lt;/i&gt;  These species are individualistic, aggressive and hustling.  They attempt to exterminate or suppress other species.  They discover new ways to live under unfavourable conditions -- admirable! -- but they are ultimately self-destructive.  They are replaced by other species which are better suited to restabilize and mature the ecosystem.  If mankind is to avoid being replaced, then the struggle &lt;i&gt; against&lt;/i&gt; nature must cease.&quot;

I&#039;m not sure the &quot;ultimately self-destructive&quot; part isn&#039;t a bit of (dark) wishful thinking, but the analogy is compelling.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2013/10/21/what-is-climate-change/#comment-33671&quot;&gt;Christian Luca (chrisnamastephys11)&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;‘Nature’ was never separate from civilization or us human beings.We as humans are a part of nature–we cannot be separated from it, or anything in nature cannot be separated from itself. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

A crucial difference is that the evolution of mankind is getting less and less &quot;nature dependent&quot; but more and more &quot;human dependent&quot;. That is mankind is more or less able to force  nature on earth and exploit it, sometimes though with unforseen consequences (as pointed out by John this phase is called the antropocene). Like mankind is able to kill all natural mammal predators with the help of weapons, apart maybe from the predators among itself. Mankind has sofar been able to keep even other predators like viruses and bacterias at least somewhat in check. A lot of humans are not anymore subject to survival in a natural setting but rather in a manmade setting. A lot of children don&#039;t learn anymore about poisonous plants in the woods or how to make fire with a flintstone but eventually sit in laptop classes while being more or less infused with streamlined learning content. So what we enter here is more a survival within different manmade concepts/ideas/realizations. Of course last but not least these manmade things come from humans which are part of nature, but the evolutionary fight is now to a great extend between humans only and not between individual humans and a natural environment in the traditional sense.
A very interesting simulation described in the article:
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/09/20/1308825110.full.pdf+html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;War, space, and the evolution of Old World complex societies&lt;/a&gt; illustrates to what this may be connected with: namely to the formation of organisatorial bodies.
Outside pressure furthers social cohesion. In particular wars among different groups of humans lead to the development of stronger laws (sometimes also identifying rites etc.) among the entities of a group (i.e. humans can here be seen as kind of cells of an organisatorial body and the laws as some kind of bonds/exchange channels etc.) or if you want one can also say &quot;wars&quot; or milder forms of conflicts often lead to a higher grade of &quot;civilization&quot; (this might include stages which some wouldn&#039;t like to call civilization) and institutionalization within a group.
In the simulation the very concrete geography plays an important role since it is linked to the availability of resources. So it seems it is less and less the individual which is fighting about resources within a natural environment, but organisatorial bodies.
Moreover nowadays the respective organisatorial bodies are less bound to national states as in ancient times, but like for the case of big corporations they may move around even in the real space-time sense. They are also less consisting of &quot;human-only-cells&quot;, that is the connectivity like via machines and the preparation of ressources via machines etc. play also a great role in the power and formation of the bodies. And different to ancient times is the fact that human goups can&#039;t just anymore easily move on if they mismanaged their resources, or if resources ceased like due to natural disasters. In particular moving along to other planets will rather probably if at all only work for smaller groups than for all of mankind (and certainly not for a lot of animals), except mankind shrinks drastically or if one moves earth itself. Which seems to be an important issue to discuss if one considers time-scales of 4-5 billion years (and given that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun#After_core_hydrogen_exhaustion&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;current predictions&lt;/a&gt; about the sun&#039;s age are correct).]]></description>
