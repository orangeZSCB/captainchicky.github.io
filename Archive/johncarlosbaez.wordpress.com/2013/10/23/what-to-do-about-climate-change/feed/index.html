I read your interesting notes (synthesis) of Radoslav Dimitrov’s talk (works). Being the work shop participant and also had the opportunity to talk to you. I am following your blog now, good work.

					<description><![CDATA[Hi John, hope your talk went well. Here&#039;s some input out of sync, oh well. For whatever my imagination is worth, I guess fall back positions to &#039;what if global warming continues&#039; are only two. 

1 is regional geo engineering by those countries who can afford the costs and have the power to withstand to-be-expected protests (collateral damage!, n.i.m.b.y.!, etc.) by their neighbours. 

2 is living with a hotter climate, which means old and/or sick people die sooner and in general they will imitate birds in climate migration. 

1 implies international political business as usual with very unusual results, 2 implies disruption of the usual international policies.

Another thing is this: confronted with the huge physical overlap &#038; feedback between civilization and nature, people tend to either stress the impact of civilization on nature with figures &#038; statistics which are inevitably subject to discussion &#038; scepsis. Or they tend, for whatever reason, to belittle the overlap and concentrate on the  figures &#038; statistics presented to them in order to always succeed in finding flaws in there. &#039;What to do about climate change&#039; comes in great part down to enhancing the Anthropocene concept and find ways to shortcut its belittlement. To illustrate the point: no country, as far as I know, adheres in its constitution to the Anthropocene concept yet they almost all adhere to the concept of climate change. There&#039;s some (inter)national legal work to be done, along with maths, physics and economics.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Much of this desire is really induced by marketing campaigns and advertisements at first
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I agree with this but I think ads are pointed towards human subconsciousnes desire to improve their status (&#039;keeping up with the Joneses&#039;) and ads only exist because it is beneficial (I would hope so) for the companies selling the producs and thus beneficial for the social status of their management/shareholders/employees.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
much more importantly, the fact that people buy more things it is exactly what keeps the economy going and thus allows most people (including probably you and me) to have a job.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Can I summarize this as: people work more -&#062; people can buy more -&#062; other people can work more and so on. Ideally then the people producing the goods would also be paid well compared to those who buy them... In some sense, it would also be nice if a better understanding of economic and social behaviour would allow the option to work less and buy less. Perhaps I should better say &#039;buy differently&#039; with less environmental impact.]]></description>

Leaving the &quot;more kids&quot; part aside, I don&#039;t think people &quot;need&quot; more of those things, they probably just &quot;want&#039; or &quot;think they want&quot; them. Much of this desire is really induced by marketing campaigns and advertisements at first, and then by the fact that when a majority of people adopts a new tool (a car, or a cell phone, or a computer) then at some point the implicit assumption is that you must have one, and if you don&#039;t it becomes increasingly harder to function in a society that has been rebuilt around these tools. Would anyone from 1913 be able to live in a city like, i don&#039;t know, Boston, today, without re-education ?

In part you can make the case that this is progress, at least in part, but much more importantly, the fact that people buy more things it is exactly what keeps the economy going and thus allows most people (including probably you and me) to have a job.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;I suppose “more kids” is not true in many countries, but I would directly classify it under reproduction.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A question here involved is how many kids do you need to produce in order to maintain replacement level. Old age care and education are a second component, which plays a role here. That is if you produce many kids then if they are dying at an early age there is not much sense in educating them costly if resources are scarce. On the other hand if you don&#039;t educate them then chances may be not so good that they may sustain themselves and eventually their old age parents, but this depends of course also on the question of wether high level knowledge is important in a society and if what kind of knowledge is relevant and how learing intensive this is. Thus if you are able to educate many children and bring them into an independent adult stage in a high level knowledge society then this may raise status and finally the survival of your genes. If you are in a low level knowledge society it may be that reproduction itself is already ensuring survival and thus a bigger reproduction rate may already raise status.]]></description>

Cars, planes, meat etc are status symbols. I believe that in an evolutionary context showing off status symbols improves chances of reproduction, thus people are biologically wired to act as such unless they are aware of it. I suppose &quot;more kids&quot; is not true in many countries, but I would directly classify it under reproduction.

(Not that biological wiring can&#039;t be circumvented, e.g. about meat I heard a story that in India the higher castes at some point became vegetarian, and gradually this worked its way into society as a whole -- if this story is true. On the other hand, maybe the high population density may have helped too, it&#039;s easier to feed vegetarians...)]]></description>
