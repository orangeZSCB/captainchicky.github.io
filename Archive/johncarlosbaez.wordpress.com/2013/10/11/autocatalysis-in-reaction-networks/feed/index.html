John, I got the term &quot;dilution&quot; from Definition 1 in this paper by Luca Cardelli. As far as I know, he invented the term.

What&#039;s a &#039;$latex G$-dilution&#039;?

I don&#039;t know that term, but I have a guess as to what you mean.  If we have a transition

wolf + rabbit $latex \to$ wolf + wolf

in our Petri net, we can also use this transition to turn

wolf + rabbit + rabbit

into

wolf + wolf + rabbit

(One rabbit stands by and watches the other get eaten.)  Manoj actually gave an example of this sort when explaining the concept of $latex \to$:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
By a complex I will mean a population vector: a snapshot of the number of tokens in each species. In the example above, (#rabbit, #wolf) is a complex. If $latex y, y&#039;$ are two complexes, then we write

$latex y \to y&#039;$

if we can get from $latex y$ to $latex y&#039;$ by a single transition in our Petri net. For example, we just saw that

$latex (4,3)\to (3,4)$

via the predation transition.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So, his use of $latex \to$ does not correspond precisely to a transition, but rather a transition &#039;with bystanders&#039;. Is this what you&#039;re calling &#039;dilution&#039;?]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;Does your explanation extend to the question of why this is not true for all critical siphons? &lt;/blockquote&gt;

My &quot;translation&quot; for conservation law should be made more precise by adding:

“conservation law”: &lt;em&gt;a group which forms an “island of stability” by having a net constant wealth via one but arbitrary way of exchange.&lt;/em&gt;

That is in the X,Y example one would - if one would apply all two transitions and not just one, keep the numbers of tokens constant. Or in other words X+Y satisfies a kind of &quot;total conservation law.&quot; So the X,Y example is critical but would not be totally critical. I could imagine that eventually by demanding &quot;total conservation&quot; on a support one might get around the minimal condition, but this is just a rough guess.]]></description>

John, I believe such objects have been studied and are called ``traps.&#039;&#039; Take a look at Definition 5 of a ``trap&#039;&#039; in this book chapter. (I may be wrong, but it seems to me on a  quick read right now that the authors may have inadvertently gotten the two definitions reversed.)

David Angeli, Patrick De Leenheer, Eduardo Sontag, 
&quot;A Petri Net Approach to Persistence Analysis in Chemical Reaction Networks.&quot;
http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.152.627&#038;rep=rep1&#038;type=pdf

The same authors also say, 

&quot;Traps for Petri-Nets enjoy the following invariance property: if a trap is non-empty at time zero (meaning that at least one of its places has tokens), then the trap is non-empty at all future times. In contrast, in a continuous set-up (when tokens are not integer quantities but may take any real value), satisfaction of the siphon-trap property does not prevent (in general) concentrations of species from decaying to zero asymptotically.&quot;
