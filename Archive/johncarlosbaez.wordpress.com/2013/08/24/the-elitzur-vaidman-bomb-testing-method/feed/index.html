					<description><![CDATA[This is a fantastic explanation, thank you. One part I still don&#039;t get: &quot;You can make it so that if the bomb doesn’t work, the photon interferes with itself and definitely goes to C, not D.&quot; Does the self-interference cause the wave function to collapse? If so, why wouldn&#039;t the particle ever go to D? Thanks again!]]></description>

 Now, if you build a second interaction-free measurement device sensitive to presence of the particle in the first you get a symmetric situation---two crossing interferometers. e.g. one device might use an electron as its particle (instead of a photon) and the other device might use a positron, so that if the two particles cross they both explode; each acts as a bomb for the other.

Surprisingly you can still get a click at the D ports of both devices simultaneously. But what does this indicate?---for surely if they crossed they would have both exploded.

This is now called Hardy&#039;s Paradox---the measurements you make to confirm it violate classical logic. Mermin wrote &quot;it stands in its pristine simplicity as one of the strangest and most beautiful gems yet to be found in the extraordinary soil of quantum mechanics.&quot;

Right.  Stripped of all its drama, this scheme just tells, a certain fraction of the time, whether or not a photon going through one of the two paths &lt;i&gt;would&lt;/i&gt; have been absorbed. 

Using some math you could abstract this idea down to its bare conceptual bones.  Then the fun part would be to generalize it and consider lots of other &#039;counterfactual procedures&#039;.

But I don&#039;t have the energy to do this now, or apply it to the detection of fake bombs!

I agree, it could determine all three position coordinates to some fixed accuracy. Still no paradox, since momentum of photon absorber doesn&#039;t matter for result, thus doesn&#039;t get measured in any way.]]></description>

It&#039;s probably worthwhile trying to get &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; sort of paradox to arise from this strange phenomenon.  You won&#039;t succeed, since quantum mechanics is consistent, but you may turn up interesting ideas in this process, or at least improve your understanding of quantum mechanics.]]></description>
