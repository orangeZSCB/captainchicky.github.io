					<description><![CDATA[Admittedly, I have yet to read the article, but something that annoys me a lot these days is that many studies pretending to have as a topic &quot;music&quot; or &quot;art&quot;, actually are reporting findings about &quot;a-specific-kind-of-music&quot; or &quot;a-specific-kind-of-art&quot;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;This suggestion brings to mind the fact that the tremendous historical gender gap in professional orchestras ...&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This is indeed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.osborne-conant.org/articles.htm#women&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;exactly what is going on&lt;/a&gt;.  And it is a very very good thing that this is not what is going on with blind auditions in orchestras these days, at least with some orchestras.

A female friend and a long-ago violin student at Juilliard relates the story of how one of the teachers was notorious among students (and presumably others) for favouring the willow blonde women.  My friend and her cohort were, naturally, exercised about this state of affairs, but with the passing of time her view has become: &quot;There are so many so very good musicians with so little technical or aesthetic difference to rank them, and so few jobs and so very few careers and so vanishingly few superstar slots, and there is so much chance involved in every step, that he might as well slightly prefer the blonds — it&#039;s not so different from flipping a coin.&quot;  The Music of Chance.

Along the same lines, since &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; of the entrants in any of the marquee musical competitions are of such spectacular ability — any of them with the technical skill to play, routinely, what used to be virtuosic finger-breakers that were the province of only the most celebrated of historical performers — then what have we left to decide who is The Winner?  Well, since the job (should a solo touring concert career eventually follow from a win at a competition, which itself is bad odds) in the end is to deliver paying middle aged enraptured musical amateurs into concert hall seats, some sort of stage presence, flamboyance, theatricality, etc, can be a real-world edge, and one that competition juries aren&#039;t ignoring, and perhaps ought not to ignore.

I find Lang Lang (pictured) irritating to watch and not aesthetically interesting to hear, but there is &lt;i&gt;absolutely no doubt&lt;/i&gt; that he is good for the (dismal) classical music biz, and that he sells seats and that he reaches vast audiences that another equally virtuosic pianist would not.  Looks and some showboating &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; count!

By the way if you think the job market for physics PhDs is bad, consider conservatory students.  And no, there isn&#039;t the &quot;slumming as a quant on Wall Street&quot; option when you wash out.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[To add yet more noise: I confess that I really enjoy watching musicians, in addition to listening. It doesn&#039;t have to be the triumphant flourish (as in the photo at the top of the post, from the looks of it the crowning moment of the performance) or otherwise anything overtly emotional, but sometimes one can read in the lines of the face (I have Michelangeli in my mind&#039;s eye) the intense absorption and concentration of an artist, and I really dig that.]]></description>

That painting was from Picasso&#039;s Rose Period, not from the cubist one, as was the one you linked. It&#039;s easy to escape from reality, when you already lost contact with it. Or maybe I fail to see the sublime message he transmitted by not drawing that guy&#039;s leg, or the other elementary mistakes in that picture, and you really see something great in these. On the other hand, at others like Dali, such escapes from reality are done at purpose and suggest something, and you can&#039;t mistake them for childish mistakes.]]></description>

&lt;a href=&quot;#comment-32508&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Cristi&lt;/a&gt;, that&#039;s really not what I meant! It&#039;s a fine thing to really enjoy music one is making, and sometimes that&#039;s a big part of what an audience connects with as well.  We just have to learn to be precise about what we mean by &lt;i&gt;music&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;performance&lt;/i&gt;; &lt;i&gt;musical skill&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;performance skill&lt;/i&gt;, etc.

As for whether there &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; be a correlation: let me put it this way, (and as a modest violinist I know something of this first-hand): it is &lt;i&gt;much harder&lt;/i&gt; to dance and control an instrument at the same time than it is to play with a relaxed, static posture.  To move expressively and play with control, one&#039;s arms and hands have to cancel out the extra torques and accelerations of moving about in a changeable manner.  A pianist has less scope for movement than a violinist, but still, if he is moving about, then he has to move his arms differently to reach the same notes and hit the keys with the same accelerations. This is not to say it can&#039;t be done, nor that the overall effect is less artistic; but it may at the same time be an exciting thing to watch and also less acoustically refined.]]></description>
