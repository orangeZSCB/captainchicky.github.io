					<description><![CDATA[Too bad that they don&#039;t want controversial ideas.

As we approach the horizon of the end of money as wages, would be nice to only allow Sub S corps, as corporations were actually intended to be only for charitable and large scale/ short term projects.

What i have been trying to get people interested in, is starting to build &quot;Loops&quot; to replace the power grid.

since we now know graphene can be basically superconducting, and we know how to make it with methanol, or any other carbon donor, we can start building elliptical loops of buried pipes filled with water for electrolyte, and graphene coated ribbons.

If the pipes are also filled with free graphene flakes, (that are easy to make with a ball mill to compact to graphite oxide, and then release with hydrogen peroxide), they work as self-assembling batteries. Though we would have to switch over to DC, you wouldn&#039;t get distribution losses, and the loops can store any inputs from solar or wind till you need em.

These buried structures become local loops of people and freight moving electric trolleys or trains, depending upon size and speed required.

Though this would seem destructive to existing city structures, it turns out that ALL of the cities in the U.S. are going to have to be dismantled , and rebuilt anyway, because of the decay of the natural gas lines.
Many of the oldest and largest east coast cities are leaking up to a third of the methane that goes into the lines.

Seems like a great excuse to move folks back from the coasts anyway. Any searise is going to cost immense amounts of cash, to attempt to offset, and that isn&#039;t even looking at increased storm intensity, or possible tsunami damage.

This storage loop grid can be built by bootstrapping across the country, using local mine and power plant ash waste, for building materials, and dispersing the population inland, while still providing easy and low carbon access.
Easy shipping, buried fiber optic, potable water distribution and protection from hazardous weather or solar storm damage too !

You can also turn that bug into a feature.
Induction from solar EM spikes will be absorbed and stored, instead of overwhelming the existing surface line grid
As far as i can tell, you can also run a cable up to a hilltop, and catch lightning with superconductors. That would run a town, to a medium city for months, depending on the lightning polarity.

This would take a lot of pressure off the existing infrastructure, by reducing the freight loading of roads and bridges.
Then we can figure out the optimal ceramic/concrete/ironwork for the rebuilding without panic. Would also give us time to deliver the 3D printing eqpt for structures that a lot of folks are working on.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Jenny, 

Thank you for contributing your thoughts to this thread:)

Btw, what you suggest is what I&#039;m trying (would like) to do (I think), but I have to pay the bills, too, so am in limbo right now.

My only comment on your thoughts is that I am skeptical that &#039;research&#039; by academics is required.  First, this is a very slow process.  Second, I think that we need people with fresh viewpoints and perspectives to look at these problems.  Third, I am unimpressed with the very latest national academic standards and curriculum which my 5th grader is experiencing.

And, speaking of problems, I&#039;ve not seen anyone come up with a thoughtful list of education and learning problems, including implicit problems which everyone seems to accept without even questioning if there is a better way.  How about we start here?

I think we need to look at the end result of a good formal (or informal) education: a brain which has usefully stored away a salient subset of knowledge and thinking/problem-solving skills, and then work backward from this end result to figure out how to best achieve this final state.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Chiming in late and somewhat randomly, and riffing off the concept of Azimuth as &quot;a clearinghouse for ideas and information,&quot; and your foundation&#039;s interest in education reform in the U.S. and elsewhere...

... how about a serious retrospective look at happy educational outcomes in people who have done most or all of their learning outside the traditional educational systems, with an eye toward finding common themes that lead to smart, thoughtful, competent  adults? I&#039;m coming at this with a certain personal bias, but I&#039;m thinking that someone with the right skills and resources and backing could extend the work and thinking of John Holt, using the same sort of research techniques George Vaillant used in his Harvard Study of Adult Development work. This would take the question of successful education out of the hands of the usual suspects -- people with graduate degrees in education and people who have a financial stake in the current system, including testing companies, textbook and curriculum providers, charter school frachisers, etc., all of whom depend on compulsory attendance laws to make a living -- whom I&#039;m pretty sure have nothing interesting to offer. 

I think folks who have avoided and/or deliberately ditched conventional educational paths (i.e. those homeschoolers who aren&#039;t on a religious mission) might have a different educational paradigm to offer. I suspect interest-based learning and engagement in the real world might work a lot better, and a lot more efficiently, than an educational system based on isolating students with the age-peers and training them to pass tests.

Or maybe I&#039;m wrong! Someone needs to do the research. The yield from this research would be, I hope, better ideas bout how to develop well-educated adults outside of the (clearly failing) educational system. In my fantasy of an alternative educational system, the existing infrastructure of libraries would be used to make information and educational resources available for everyone. (What are libraries, anyway, but free, publicly-supported clearinghouses for ideas and information?) 

This is sounding increasingly half-baked even as I write it, but if an idea could go viral that would lead to more children growing up to be smart, skeptical, flexible, engaged, awake adults, it could to a lot of good.]]></description>

I like all these suggestions---thanks!  

Since I&#039;m leaving Singapore soon and will help inaugurate the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.qmac.ox.ac.uk/events/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Quantum Mathematics and Computation&lt;/a&gt; center in Oxford on October 1-4 and give a &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.google.com/u/0/117663015413546257905/posts/eTMZG6bVd6f&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;TEDx talk in Turin&lt;/a&gt; on October 5, I&#039;m getting too frantic to think about these issues properly now.  So for now I&#039;ll just mull over what you, and everyone else here, is saying.  

Later I will organize my thoughts---but also point people at this foundation to this blog article, so people can read all of &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; thoughts without my intermediation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1) Perhaps the foundation should also consider spending smaller chunks ($10K - $100K) to get multiple ideas off the ground to the point of being ready for team building and federal funding RFP grant programs.  Plant many seeds...

&lt;i&gt;I would advise adding a stipulation that research funded at universities is to be &#039;open&#039; and not controlled by campus technology commercialization offices.&lt;/i&gt;

2) Another low-cost service the foundation could provide is networking events so that idea people can informally meet potential funding entities and interested facilitators.

3) I, too, would like to see a list of problems with weights for importance, cost, payback, immediacy, timeline, and the probability of success (problem is actually solvable in a practical sense).]]></description>

&quot;Personally I really like what’s going on at Yale-NUS College, where all the students will be required to analyze and criticize the use of statistics in newspaper articles, and learn more about statistical methods. With luck this will breed an educated elite who can see mistakes in the news, and maybe even some journalists who can avoid making those mistakes.

Pondering the question of how to philanthropically spend millions; my Bayesian reasoning seems to converge towards some indirect proportionality between dollars and species-proof plus Earth-saving effect... So let me suggest this extremum: Use the paradigm of JB&#039;s Azimuth academy to establish a virtual reality-based reasoning hub for solving the MENA population overshoot probem (e.g. Syria). One general and actual question currently pondered is how to balance collateral damage and dissolution of a system (e.g. Assad family) proven incapable of handling a large population with depleting resources and/or deteriorating habitat. (Obama should not think about it too deeply. Or?)

If you want to spend a few more dollars: there are projects for carbon negative renewable non-nuclear technology, harnessing photosynthesis to gain civilized heat and electricity. I.e. investing according to the biogeophysico-ethical imperative of the 21st century: &lt;i&gt;Try to live carbon-negative&lt;/i&gt;. 0.5m$/€ would be helpful e.g. here: http://www.gekgasifier.com/ (U.S.) or here: http://www.holzgasjournal.de/ (Germany). Plus, some lobbying for a decent U.S./EU agriculture bill. If you want to go into shiny industrial w* I suggest spending 2m on developing a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.fi/search?q=wood+gas+hybrid+upgrade+pack&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;wood gas hybrid upgrade pack&lt;/a&gt; for E-vehicles.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;don’t seem to enjoy activities that bring up a lot of controversy. So, I don’t think they would promote birth control in third world countries.&lt;/blockquote&gt;...which would qualify them as non-philanthropic. E.g. (not to speak of Rwanda):

Syria exemplifies a paradigmatic failure of elementary (non-Gaussian) risk management (a discipline the Late Homo Sapiens is failing miserably, recently in finance, and currently). Meanwhile, climate change meets overpopulation: Try, at least, to avoid potential lose-lose situations. Try at least to reason (risk and asset management) according to Murphy&#039;s law: &lt;i&gt;Time does not halt&lt;/i&gt;, the sh* will inevitably hit the fan one time (it might be now). Beware the exponential. Who wants to contribute to the stability of a system (let alone its non-destructive possible dissolution.) needs to help enforce the principle of &lt;i&gt;interconnected sedentary non-genosuicidality&lt;/i&gt; for a compact geobiosphere, i.e.: &lt;b&gt;Do not multiply&lt;/b&gt;.
