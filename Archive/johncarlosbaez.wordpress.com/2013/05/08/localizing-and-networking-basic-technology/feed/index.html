					<description><![CDATA[Dear Lee,

I don&#039;t know enough about these two important topics to give a good response to your questions, but I&#039;ll try. Certainly in a simulation type game (such as the one I propose), economic factors such as WOMP can be incorporated. But I don&#039;t think WOMP  would be very interesting unless the scale of the village was in the thousands or millions. As to water allocation, I think this illustrates one of the general advantages of localization: that if the Tragedy of the Commons happens in your back yard, you have an immediate feedback to change your ways. If you are enabled by global industrialization to deplete and destroy resources (such as water) from some other place and not face (at least in the short term) those consequences (in fact your consequences are profitable), you will continue your behavior.

I am actually trying to develop some land now in a semi arid region of California where the water table has been dropping for a while due to industrial agriculture. I am guessing that If people are just trying to live on the land with wells, pumps, tanks/cisterns and hoses (or other water carrying tech) that they built themselves out of local materials and tools, water depletion does not/will not happen. But if they use tech made by Chinese slaves, running on petroleum from far-away places and selling a product to far away places, they will continue their behavior until the water runs out. Also, people in the &quot;developing&quot; world will probably not take good care of pumps that require parts that they have to buy from the global industrial market, unless they are driven by profit, but then they&#039;ll deplete the aquifers.6]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;However, it seems clear that compared to the enormous and uncontroversial death toll due to burning coal, the rather subtle (if any) health effects of a disaster like Fukushima are indeed negligible.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Frankly I feel very uneasy hearing you call 600 more or less confirmed deaths and -if the studies are correct- 1000 more cancer deaths &quot;negligible&quot; - regardless in comparision to what! And as said it could have been much more deaths.

Apart from that I don&#039;t think that people would care much about coal plants if there would be fewer of them. It is in particular the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.randform.org/blog/?p=1336&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;scale&lt;/a&gt; which makes the difference. In particular &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldcoal.org/resources/frequently-asked-questions/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;there are:&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;According to the IEA Clean Coal Centre, there are over 2300 coal-fired power stations worldwide (7000 individual units). Approximately 620 of these power stations are in China.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There are currently &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.euronuclear.org/info/encyclopedia/n/nuclear-power-plant-world-wide.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt; 437&lt;/a&gt; nuclear power plants.
 

Moreover future nuclear power will make use of breeders, which are sofar a rather uncommon technology and which may fuel a plutonium market.

So there are roughly 6 times more coal plants than nuclear plants. There were 2 major nuclear accidents (Tchernobyl, Fukushima) within roughly 40 years (and numerous &quot;smaller&quot; ones and apart from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.randform.org/blog/?p=1629&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;other problems&lt;/a&gt; ). One can somewhat imagine how the accident rate scales with a factor of 6 and how this goes together with the installation of a rather new uncommon technology, an accumulating waste problem and a rising demand for optimization due to raising economic pressure.

&lt;blockquote&gt;However, I don’t think we are in that situation. We are in a tough spot, and an imperfect solution is better than a solution that doesn’t work.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I wouldn&#039;t call the above problems &quot;imperfections&quot;.

If you enter an airplane there is a difference between wether the colour of the seats is imperfect or wether the engines are not working properly e.g. due to an &quot;imperfectly casted rotor&quot;. You wouldn&#039;t call the latter an &quot;imperfection&quot;. And of course the correct balancing between need and risk plays a bigger role in the latter case.

In principle there is sofar no need for nuclear power generation.

I think one of the great challenges of nowadays science and technology is to decide which science and technology should NOT be applied and used on a greater scale (and if at all at what scale) and to find ways to implement the findings.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Would the village be a good place to test mathematical models of &quot;word of mouth promotion&quot; that might be evident in the allocation of water? 

http://hbswk.hbs.edu/archive/1956.html

Papers about administered-system versus market-based allocation of water seem to be ignoring the individual&#039;s role in relevant markets and policies. Word-of-mouth promotion would take the individual to be basic in markets and policy-- because consumers, voters and other types of individuals are always involved in markets and policy of this type.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23597927

How much word-of-mouth promotion would be/should be involved in water allocation? 

What kinds of conversations are involved? Could the conversation part of word-of-mouth promotion be effectively modeled by a two-person mathematical game? In word-of-mouth promotion a network of conversing individuals exists; so would closing circles in networks of word-of-mouth promoters be the necessary condition for market and political coalition efficiency? Could lab studies in experimental game theory be translated by mathematical models of the game, and network, of word-of-mouth-promotion into large-scale action toward the needed policies and markets? 

To be helpful, tools will have to be found in less that one generation.

I think it&#039;s good that people are treating the UN and World Health Organization claims about Fukushima skeptically and demanding more evidence.   I am sure we will learn more as time goes on.  However, it seems clear that compared to the enormous and uncontroversial death toll due to burning coal, the rather subtle (if any) health effects of a disaster like Fukushima are indeed negligible.

If solar, wind and hydro were able to grow fast enough to generate enough power to stop global warming soon enough to prevent serious problems, I would say we should avoid nuclear power.  However, I don&#039;t think we are in that situation.  We are in a tough spot, and an imperfect solution is better than a solution that doesn&#039;t work.]]></description>

From the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.unis.unvienna.org/unis/en/pressrels/2013/unisinf475.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;UNSCEAR website:&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;No radiation-related deaths or acute effects have been observed among nearly 25,000 workers (including TEPCO employees and contractors) involved at the accident site.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

How good are the workers informed about what could be a radiation related effect? How good is the radiation screening? 

How good is the health screening? 

Or blatantly put - iff one does too few or doesn&#039;t do any health or radiation screenings at all for a case than one will of course observe no effects for that case.

From the above &lt;a href=&quot;http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/politics/AJ201212090052&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;cited article:&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;He said he never saw officials from regulatory government agencies in those areas.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and again the worker statement from above:
&lt;blockquote&gt;“I was told to work at the plant like a kamikaze pilot,” said the man, who is evacuating from Fukushima Prefecture due to high levels of radiation he received. “I have no idea about how much radiation I was exposed to.”
Not only in the very first days there were not enough measurement apparatus.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
and another quote form that article:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The man said workers at the Fukushima No. 1 plant are being exploited.

“Workers come from around the country because they are willing to work even at a nuclear plant due to the economic slump,” he said. “Many businesses siphon off part of their wages, taking advantage of their vulnerable positions.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and another quote from &lt;a href=&quot;http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201303020048&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;another article:&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Electric utilities and their contractors are obliged to issue personal records for workers at nuclear facilities and in cleanup work and monitor their radiation exposure to keep it within legal limits: up to 50 millisieverts annually and 100 millisieverts over five years.

The records also include the results of their health checks.

Workers receive their records when their contracts end, and new employers are supposed to use them to ascertain the accumulated radiation dose of each individual.

In addition to tracking the radiation exposure of their workers themselves, utilities are also supposed to submit the data in electronic form to the Radiation Effects Association, a public entity, for centralized management.

Earlier, TEPCO was found to have failed to send the association data for a total of 21,000 workers employed over a period from the nuclear accident through fiscal 2011.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and
&lt;blockquote&gt;The ministry announced in October that it confirmed 19 instances of irregularities, including non-use of dosimeters.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But as I mentioned in my above comment this UNSCEAR assessment is not final :

&lt;blockquote&gt;The report that is finally adopted by the Committee will be presented to the United Nations General Assembly when it meets later this year, and the scientific data and evaluation underpinning that report will be published separately.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and so the UNSCEAR may still have some final comments on what haven&#039;t been observed because it wasn&#039;t observed.]]></description>

I just happened to bump into &lt;a href=&quot;http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/31/experts-foresee-no-detectable-health-impact-from-fukushima-radiation/?smid=tw-share&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; by Andrew Revkin, an environmental columnist for the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;.  I&#039;ll quote a lot of it here and study the reports more later.

&lt;blockquote&gt;

The levels of exposure to radiation following the leaks and explosions at the earthquake-damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station in 2011 were so low that they led today to this important conclusion from experts convened in Vienna by the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effect of Atomic Radiation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

    It is unlikely to be able to attribute any health effects in the future among the general public and the vast majority of workers.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Scientists had met all week to make final adjustments to a report on Fukushima radiation and health that will be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly later this year.

The findings are even more definitive on the lack of risk than those in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/01/world/asia/who-sees-low-health-risks-from-fukushima-accident.html?pagewanted=all&#038;_r=0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;World Health Organization report&lt;/a&gt; on the nuclear incident in February. An &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/cancer-rates-not-expected-to-rise-after-japans-fukushima-nuclear-accident-8639705.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Associated Press account&lt;/a&gt; from a news conference following the meeting describes the difference:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
    Wolfgang Weiss, a senior member of the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation, …suggested the UNSCEAR study, carried out by 80 experts and with the involvement of five international organisations including the United Nations health agency, was based on information covering a longer period after the accident.

    “So they (the WHO) didn’t have the full picture. We don’t have the full picture either but we have more than one year in addition,” he said.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here’s more from the news release issued by the United Nations committee:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
    The additional exposures received by most Japanese people in the first year and subsequent years due to the radioactive releases from the accident are less than the doses received from natural background radiation (which is about 2.1 mSv per year). This is particularly the case for Japanese people living away from Fukushima, where annual doses of around 0.2 mSv from the accident are estimated, arising primarily through ingestion of radionuclides in food.

    No radiation-related deaths or acute effects have been observed among nearly 25,000 workers (including TEPCO employees and contractors) involved at the accident site.

    Given the small number of highly exposed workers, it is unlikely that excess cases of thyroid cancer due to radiation exposure would be detectable. Special health examinations will be given to workers with exposures above 100 mSv including annual monitoring of the thyroid, stomach, large intestine and lung for cancer as a means to monitor for potential late radiation-related health effects at the individual level.

    The assessment also concluded that although the rate of exposures may have exceeded the levels for the onset of effects on plants and animals several times in the first few months following the accident, any effects are expected to be transient in nature, given their short duration. In general, the exposures on both marine and terrestrial non-human biota were too low for observable acute effects. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.unis.unvienna.org/unis/en/pressrels/2013/unisinf475.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;[Read the rest.]

I&#039;ll need to do a bit more research on this---thanks for the references.  If the death toll due to radiation is among the higher figures you mention, I wouldn&#039;t call that negligible.   But as you know, these estimates tend to be controversial.  And I certainly won&#039;t accept any estimate made by Mark Z.  Jacobson without further study!  For example, in his paper &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/A+path+to+sustainable+energy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;A path to sustainable energy&lt;/a&gt;, Jacobson claimed that

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Nuclear power results in up to 25 times more carbon emissions than wind energy, when reactor construction and uranium refining and transport are considered.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Barry Brook investigated this claim and wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Hold on. How could this be? I’ve shown here that the “reactor construction” argument is utterly fallacious—wind has a building material footprint over 10 times larger than that of nuclear, on energy parity basis. Further, Peter Lang has shown that wind, once operating, offsets 20 times LESS carbon per unit energy than nuclear power, when a standard natural gas backup for wind is properly considered. I’ve also explained in this post that the emissions stemming from mining, milling, transport and refining of nuclear fuel is vastly overblown, and is of course irrelevant for fast spectrum and molten salt thorium reactors. So…?

Well, you have to look to the technical version of the paper to trace the source of the claim. It comes from Jacobson 2009, where he posited that nuclear power means nuclear proliferation, nuclear proliferation leads to nuclear weapons, and this chain of events lead to nuclear war, so they calculate (?!) the carbon footprint of a nuclear war!
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Indeed, the cited paper by Jacobson posits a war in which fifty 15-kiloton nuclear devices are used, setting cities afire, giving CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions of 92–690 teragrams. 

This does not really explain the high figure arrived at by Jacobson: it&#039;s just a small portion of the carbon footprint he estimates.  However, it suggests one has to carefully investigate how he does his calculations.
