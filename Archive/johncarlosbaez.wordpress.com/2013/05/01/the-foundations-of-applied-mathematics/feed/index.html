We had a discussion about UML, statecharts and Petri nets &lt;a href=&quot;http://azimuth.mathforge.org/discussion/1005/feynman-diagrams-and-uml-sequence-diagrams/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://azimuth.mathforge.org/discussion/1008/?Focus=6993&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  I was not ready, at the time, to put in the work to understand what statecharts are!  I may still not be ready.  So maybe you can get more out of this discussion than I did.

Comments on comments on comments get skinnier and skinnier and skinnier, so at some point this process cuts off, and then you go back up the comment tree to the first point a reply is allowed.  You did fine!

I only knew that as a saying: &quot;You never step in the same river twice&quot;.

Regarding the mystery of time, here&#039;s a perhaps more puzzling paradox of Nagarjuna:  If cause precedes effect, how does it bridge time?  If cause and effect were simultaneous, how to discern cause and effect? (From autocommentary to  verse 6 of sunyatasaptati. Hume has another argument that cause and effect can&#039;t be simultaneous.)

Ergo, time must be discrete.]]></description>

Yes my experience as a sporadic user of UML tends to confirm the grab-bag characterization.  

That said, there seems to be an attempt to define at least some of the diagram types with care.   Kinda-sorta consistent w/ this assertion, a) I gather that there are a number of UML-consuming SW tools out there, b) there is a UML metamodel and meta-metamodel.]]></description>

We&#039;re a bit less likely to treat $latex x$ and $latex y$ as equal if we&#039;ve got a morphism $latex f : x \to y$ that&#039;s not invertible.  However, it&#039;s not a hard-and-fast rule.  

Examples from physics are a bit confusing for me here.My favorite counterexample comes from theory of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rewriting&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;rewriting&lt;/a&gt;---which you may understand well, because it&#039;s important in symbolic computation.

In rewriting theory we often want a set of rules for rewriting expressions that is &lt;b&gt;terminating&lt;/b&gt; (the process always ends) and &lt;b&gt;confluent&lt;/b&gt; (even if we have different choices about how to rewrite an expression, we can always make choices later on that lead to the same final result):

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confluence_%28abstract_rewriting%29#General_case_and_theory&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Confluence.png&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This guarantees that if we keep using our rules to rewrite an expression, the process eventually leads to a unique final answer.  

Rules that are terminating and confluent can never be reversible!  Nonetheless, if we type something like

$latex \displaystyle{ \int 5 x dx } $

into Matlab and it spits out

$latex \displaystyle{  \frac{5}{2} x^2 + C }$

it has probably used terminating and confluent rules to do this calculation... and mathematicians are willing to summarize this with an equation:

$latex \displaystyle{  \int 5 x dx = \frac{5}{2} x^2 + C }$]]></description>
