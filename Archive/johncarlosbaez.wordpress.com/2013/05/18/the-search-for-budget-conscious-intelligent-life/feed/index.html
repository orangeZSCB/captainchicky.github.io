					<description><![CDATA[THANKS FOR THE COMMENTS...

Some critics of SETI point to the Fermi Paradox: if smart techno-life is around, why haven’t they spread through the galaxy, then visited our solar system and left easy-to-find artifacts? There are many answers to this. Maybe the alien artifacts are hard to find, or even deliberately disguise themselves. Or maybe aliens much like ourselves find interstellar flight just too hard to do.

Studying the size of the problem makes sense, then. Getting a feel for that difficult first step, reaching our nearest star, can make us reflect on how plausible it is to expect galactic colonization. This issue we teased out in the May 21-22 Clarke Center Symposium, and the book it was based on, Starship Century. To get it now, go to starshipcentury.com.]]></description>

Without assigning any probabilities, I believe that if humanity gets through the next thousand years or so without any catastrophic setbacks, it&#039;s very likely that after a further ten million years our descendants will have some presence across the whole galaxy.

As for aliens, for all we know a thousand civilisations might already have placed pebble-sized supercomputers — each one hosting tens of millions of software inhabitants — around every star in the galaxy.

But none of this precludes other civilisations, perhaps for some limited portion of their history, operating the kinds of beacons discussed in the Benfords&#039; paper.  While we&#039;re waiting to either meet or become a galaxy-spanning civilisation, we might as well look for the kinds of things we&#039;d have some chance of detecting.]]></description>

John, Greg,

I estimate that the probability that we will colonise the galaxy within 10My is .98. I&#039;m reading Steven Pinker&#039;s The Better Angels of our Nature at the moment, and am feeling quite upbeat about humanity just now. I would give a lower probability at other times, but rarely below .9. By &#039;we&#039; I mean any human-originated organisms: GM humans, bionic humans, our self-replicating machines, whatever. Note the .98 includes the possibility of extremely painful setbacks along the way.

It seems to me that the steps from a radio transmitter level of technology, to an interstellar travel technology, to a star system colonising ability are not huger than ones we&#039;ve made before. And once colonies can make more colonies, and there are at least ten of them, the process is nearly impossible to stop.

What are your probabilities and why? Do you think aliens are likely to have much lower chances than us? You have to assume a very small probability to help much with the Fermi paradox.

The specifics of Von Neumann probes and Dyson spheres are not important, it is the thinking behind them that is important. The name &#039;probe&#039; is bizarre - life does not probe, it colonises. Dyson spheres as such are clearly silly, but breaking up planets is not. If you believe other strategies are more likely, you need to show how they would outcompete this one.  Natural selection has a lot of slack, it produces a large amount of arbitrary morphology and behaviour. But there are limits. If one strategy gives access to 1000s of times more resources than another strategy, it is very hard for the poorly-resourced strategy to dominate.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;I thought a Gedankenexperiment, some months ago, that has persuaded me that faster-than-light message are possible.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Macroscopic entanglement won&#039;t change anything.  If you think that entangling lots of atoms in part A with atoms in part B means that, say, shaking part A will cause part B to vibrate, I&#039;m afraid that&#039;s just not true.

If you analyse something like this in detail, you&#039;ll find that the expectation value for anything you can observe about part B will be unaffected by anything you do to part A.]]></description>

I thought a Gedankenexperiment, some months ago, that has persuaded me that faster-than-light message are possible.
I think that it is possible to create a macroscopic entanglement, using a crystal cooled near 0°K (singlet quantum state for the third law of thermodynamics), so that a cut of the crystal (into two equal parts) create a correlated macroscopic wave function (like the EPR paradox, using macroscopic object).
I think that each perturbation of one part of the crystal is istantly transmitted to the second crystal (there is a single wave function): it is only a instantaneous switch, but if this is true, then can be generalized to control (for example) a martian robot in real time (or using an intermediate entangled satellite transmitter).
This is the reason that led me to write in the blog, a chain of (for me) non-trivial reasoning.
Thank you for your time.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;Alice can collapse with quick ortogonal measure (x-axis or z-axis), then Bob measure a change in x-spin, and z-spin&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With any quantum state like this, whether it&#039;s a photon&#039;s polarisation or an electron&#039;s spin, there&#039;s no measurement you can perform that will always tell you &lt;i&gt;what the state was&lt;/i&gt;.

Suppose particles A and B are in a spin singlet state so that their total spin is zero, and Alice tries to send a message to Bob by choosing whether to measure the spin of particle A along either the x-axis or the z-axis.

If Alice chooses the x-axis, then both particle A and particle B will have a definite spin along the x-axis. But Bob doesn&#039;t know her choice, and there&#039;s nothing he can measure about particle B that will reveal it.  If he measure its spin along the x-axis, he will get some result (positive spin along the x-axis or negative spin along the x-axis).  But if Alice had chosen the z-axis, the same two results would still be possible for Bob&#039;s measurement, because any definite spin along the z-axis is &lt;i&gt;also&lt;/i&gt; equal to a superposition of the two definite spins along the x-axis.

There&#039;s nothing Bob can do that will tell him whether particle B had a definite spin along the x-axis or a definite spin along the z-axis.  If he later gets a message from Alice that tells him which axis she chose and what spin she measured, he will learn that if they both picked the same axis, the total spin of particle A and particle B along that axis added up to zero.  But without any extra information from Alice, particle B can&#039;t tell him anything.]]></description>

I suppose that exist a natural production of spin singlet in some part of space.
In the EPR paradox the measure of Alice spin collapse the state of the Bob spin.
The spin of Alice is random, then the Bob spin is random (no communication possible).
Alice can collapse with quick ortogonal measure (x-axis or z-axis), then Bob measure a change in x-spin, and z-spin, measure.
I was thinking to a photon polarization (matter-antimatter annihilation), so that an astronomical measure can be simple (polarization transmission), but maybe I changed my mind.
Thank you for the clear demonstration.]]></description>

My point is just that it&#039;s much harder to colonize the Galaxy than send radio messages.   The dollar figures for a radio beacon versus colonizing Mars are just meant to illustrate this.

Eventually some civilization should arise that can spread through the Galaxy.   But we haven&#039;t seen that, so what should we do in the meantime?  It seems quite possible that only a tiny fraction of civilizations will reach the point of spreading through the Galaxy, while the rest die out before they do this.  If so, there may already be civilizations who have reached the point of being able to communicate across the Galaxy using radio waves, despite the apparent lack of Galaxy-colonizing ones.  If so, there&#039;s something easy we can do: listen for radio waves, while keeping in mind the constraints faced by primitive civilizations like our own.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I feel that I am thinking biologically, and that I keep seeing physicists who are not thinking that way...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I don&#039;t agree with you.  I feel I&#039;m thinking like a detective trying to solve a mystery given the available clues.  Sure, it makes biological sense that a civilization will eventually colonize the Galaxy.  But what does that insight help us do?  For the most part is just puts us in the arms of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Fermi Paradox&lt;/a&gt;.  (Another physicist.  &lt;img src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/emoticons/tongue2.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;) 

If we could find a really convincing solution to that, this would count as progress.  But it also pays to seek more evidence, and looking for radio signals is a cheap way to do this.  (So is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrasolar_planet&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;exoplanetology&lt;/a&gt;, but we&#039;re already putting a lot of effort into that.)

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Sending kids to Mars is silly...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I agree, and I &lt;a href=&quot;http://memetherapy.wordpress.com/2009/01/26/manned-vs-unmanned-spaceflight/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;constantly inveigh&lt;/a&gt; against wasting resources this way.  My point in invoking Mars was to point out how hard it is to get there: and this is pathetically easy compared to getting to the next star.  So there could be plenty of civilizations that fizzle out before they leave their solar systems.  Maybe ours.]]></description>

Sure, it makes biological sense that a civilization will eventually colonize the Galaxy.  But what does that insight help us do?  For the most part is just puts us in the arms of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox" rel="nofollow">Fermi Paradox</a>.  (Another physicist.  <img src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/emoticons/tongue2.gif" alt="" />) </p>
<p>If we could find a really convincing solution to that, this would count as progress.  But it also pays to seek more evidence, and looking for radio signals is a cheap way to do this.  (So is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrasolar_planet" rel="nofollow">exoplanetology</a>, but we&#8217;re already putting a lot of effort into that.)</p>

<p>I agree, and I <a href="http://memetherapy.wordpress.com/2009/01/26/manned-vs-unmanned-spaceflight/" rel="nofollow">constantly inveigh</a> against wasting resources this way.  My point in invoking Mars was to point out how hard it is to get there: and this is pathetically easy compared to getting to the next star.  So there could be plenty of civilizations that fizzle out before they leave their solar systems.  Maybe ours.</p>

Since we haven&#039;t yet met anyone&#039;s kids, it seems perfectly reasonable to invest a modest amount of time and resources on SETI, and on thinking about different approaches to SETI.  I&#039;m sure it&#039;s a long shot, but it&#039;s massively premature to write it off as futile, least of all on the basis that Dyson spheres and Von Neumann machines are some kind of &quot;inevitable&quot; endpoint for every space-faring culture.]]></description>
