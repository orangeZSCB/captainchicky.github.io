					<description><![CDATA[To John&#039;s original request, on #2, there is a loophole in the carbon tax concept pertaining to this, in that carbon emissions for transporting goods on extended supply chains may not, and probably will not be covered by individual national authorities. Thus, it is important to assess companies with extended supply chains the full cost of their indulgence. I do not know of any overall organization which does this.  I know, looking at by-waste from producing consumer products, that the aphorism is 80 pounds of by-waste for every pound of consumer product. I don&#039;t know of a similar relation for carbon dioxide, and I doubt it would be linear, but it&#039;s several multiples, at least.  

So, along these lines there is the idea of &quot;extended producer responsibility&quot;, something quite different than &quot;product stewardship&quot;, and documented at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_producer_responsibility as well as at http://www.pro-e.org/ and http://www.ilsr.org/the-concepts-of-extended-producer-responsibility-and-product-stewardship/.  This is actually, in my opinion, a conservative political position.  Why should government and the general public provide subsidies of waste cleanup to the advantage of individual manufacturers or producers?  Or their customers? Such costs should be borne by the manufacturers, including in the prices of their products.  Thus, while value-added taxes might be loathed, to the degree each step in a supply chain works because there are unpriced externalities used to keep its costs artificially low means the general public bears the cost of cleanup. 

While it may be unworkable to file public nuisance lawsuits against greenhouse gas emitters, it may be feasible to assign to each member of a manufacturing chain the responsibility for cleaning up ALL their waste, and collecting the waste containers and the like that their consumers generate uniquely and specifically by using their products.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2013/04/28/bridging-the-greenhouse-gas-emissions-gap/#comment-28188&quot;&gt;Bruce Smith&lt;/a&gt;.

I would agree about personal freedoms if people were better investors than they are. The promise is very large. The return on savings we get from people changing their personal habits and pursuing energy efficient behaviors and purchases is enormous, immediate, and has been recognized by utilities in their incentive programs which pay consumers to use less electricity. This is not government subsidized.  The cost of capital for building additional capacity and associated risks dwarf costs of these incentive programs for the companies.

The argument that people are not good protectors of even their own economic interests results from the insights of Kahneman, Tversky, and others, per http://pubclimate.ch.mm.st/ProspectTheorySlide.png.

The fact we can do enormous good things by changing personal behavior was documented in a 2010 report by McKinsey and Company, per http://pubclimate.ch.mm.st/WeCanDoIt.png

These are snaps of slides in an upcoming Web-based presentation I am preparing documenting why climate disruption is inevitable from a purely Physical perspective, its consequences, and some policy implications.

This is not a game.  Whether people act or not, the primary recipients of damage from our collective behavior will be our economies.  I think Dr Martin Wolf and others at The Financial Times are getting the message. (See http://video.ft.com/v/2396762559001/Wolf-on-averting-climate-chaos and http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/9742cc76-c142-11e2-b93b-00144feab7de.html). Certainly Lord Nicholas Stern gets it, per http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2013/jan/27/nicholas-stern-climate-change-davos.]]></description>

You were using LaTeX in ways that don&#039;t work on Wordpress blogs.  For creating links and italicizing words, you need to use HTML here.  I edited your post.  (You can&#039;t, sorry.)

Unsurprisingly, I agree with your point!]]></description>

According to this researcher, increasing global populations of grazing livestock, while managing the grazing patterns of these large herds, has the (tested and proven) effect of bringing deserts back to life such that carbon can be sequestered through storage in (ever-thickening) layers of topsoil, soil which through current land management schemes is being eroded such that it no longer stores carbon. He claims that this is the only way that carbon can be brought back to pre-industrial levels, and that it is possible for this to work in a time-span appropriate to saving our planet, and that this method will surpass even complete elimination of carbon-based fuel usage. The necessary and important side benefit of managing large herds of grazing animals is that the humans that manage them have a source of healthy, grass-fed, natural food (i.e. the animals).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My personal view is that it would be both silly and evil to ban incandescent lightbulbs, regardless of how inefficient they are. (Silly, because economics will lead people to switch on their own once the alternatives are truly good enough, as is starting to happen rapidly in the U.S. with LED bulbs; and the environmental costs not included in the price are probably worse for some of the alternatives (e.g. mercury-containing fluorescent bulbs, which are hazardous when disposed of) than for incandescent bulbs. Evil, because it&#039;s a needless and in many cases harmful restriction on personal freedom. There may remain some uses for which only the incandescent bulbs work well, and the final decisions about that, as well as about when and how it&#039;s best to phase out and replace old bulbs, can only be made well by the people directly involved.

My &quot;political calculus&quot; view is that in the U.S. at least, many people care strongly about personal freedom, and agree that economic decisions are made better when not centrally planned, and will therefore feel the same way. I know there are efforts and perhaps partial successes to ban incandescent bulbs in some states, but there is also lots of opposition to this, and I predict there will be too much opposition to pass it on a national level, or for the state bans to survive once they start having a big effect. So the net result of pursuing that sort of ban (I predict) is mainly to discredit the proponents, feed conspiracy theories, distract from more important issues, and get conflated with other potential government actions which deserve to be considered separately.

I would say the same things about any proposed ban of personal behavior or choices which are only moderately harmful on the individual level. As far as I know, whatever legitimate goals such proposed bans have could (in theory) be much better (and more fairly) achieved by taxes which try to shift external costs onto the individuals that cause them. (Of course taxes can also be harmful, but as long as their rates are reasonable they are far less harmful than bans.)

In the case of light bulbs, that would mean taxes on pollution due to electric power production, and possibly on manufactured items based on their likely disposal costs. Those sorts of plans have long been proposed but never passed, but that&#039;s a bad reason to try to pass a more limited but much worse and harmful plan.]]></description>
