					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2013/04/19/petri-net-programming-part-3/#comment-27735&quot;&gt;domenico&lt;/a&gt;.

I am thinking today that there is a differential equation, and so a function, for each

$latex 0=F(y,\dot y,\ddot y) $

have the local solution

$latex a_n =-\frac{\left.\frac{\partial F}{\partial \dot y}\right&#124;_0}{\left.\frac{\partial F}{\partial \ddot y}\right&#124;_0} a_{n-1}-\frac{\left.\frac{\partial F}{\partial y}\right&#124;_0}{\left.\frac{\partial F}{\partial \ddot y}\right&#124;_0} a_{n-2} $

If the parameters are constant, and equal to 1, then these are Fibonacci numbers (or more complex sequences):

$latex a_n =a_{n-1}+a_{n-2} $

then the parameters are (using matrix calculus to obtain the eigenvalues):

$latex a_n=\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\left[\left(\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^{n+1}-\left(\frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^{n+1}\right] $

then the differential equation (Fibonacci differential equation) is:

$latex 0 = \ddot y -\dot y- y $

and the solution is:

$latex y(t)=A\ e^{\frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2}t}+ B e^{\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}t} $

there is a countable number of differential equation, and the nth number can be obtained (for each differential equation) from the solution of the differential equation:

$latex a_n = \left.\frac{\partial y(t)}{\partial t}\right&#124;_0 $

If all is right, it seem to me interesting.]]></description>

By the way, not sure why you call it &quot;implicit&quot;. To me a DAE is just an ODE with additional (typically equality) constraints, which force the solution into a subspace or subset. In the first case (subspace) this is equivalent to applying a projection operator, which results in a lower dimensional ODE.]]></description>

Yes, a Differential Algebraic Equation, sorry should have specified it above. Also DOF means degrees of freedom, in the mechanical sense.]]></description>

What&#039;s a DAE? Is it a differential-algebraic equation?  In other words, an implicit differential equation?]]></description>

Hi David, that&#039;s easy. Try to write the equations of motion for a 4 (or more) DOF robotic arm, and then you&#039;ll see by yourself ...

For example, have a look at this old &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.mathworks.com/seth/2009/02/26/modeling-mechanical-systems-the-double-pendulum/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; that describes just a double pendulum, and imagine what happens when you add a couple or more links to it, and maybe some translational and rotational joints ...

You can derive the equations with symbolic tools (e.g Mathematica, Mupad, Maple), and there are people successfully doing that. However, as you can imagine, an equation that span 3 full pages is not that insightful. Also, from a purely computational perspective, you quickly hit a wall where just evaluating that formula takes more time than actually integrating the ODEs or DAEs (at least that was true when i was more involved in these things about 15 years ago, but i suspect that it&#039;s still true, even though i hear that symbolic-based algorithms have advanced in the meantime).

Finally, imagine your robotic arm has an end effector (an hand) that at some point picks something up. When that happens, the mass changes, and you have to recalculate the numerical parameters of your symbolic equations, while if you are just integrating an ODE you can just go on with a different value of the mass parameter for your last link. Similarly, if your arm (or leg) touches the ground, the structure of your equations drastically and instantly changes, so if you are using a symbolic approach you have to recalculate all the equations, while if you are integrating the ODEs, you can just more or less change the structure on the fly (to a DAE) and then keep on with the integration.]]></description>

I don&#039;t know if exist already a my old toy model.
I tried to solve a general differential equation, using the approximation of the surface in the derivative space with a plane: this is a mix of formula-based approach, and a computational approach:
$latex 0 = F(y,\dot y, \ddot y,\cdots) $
then near the initial value:
$latex 0 =\left.\frac{\partial F}{\partial y}\right&#124;_0 (y-y_0)+\left.\frac{\partial F}{\partial \dot y}\right&#124;_0 (\dot y-\dot y_0)+\left.\frac{\partial F}{\partial \ddot y}\right&#124;_0(\ddot y-\ddot y_0)+\cdots $
so that is possible the solution with the power series:
$latex y(t) = y_0+\dot y_0+\frac{\ddot y}{2}+\sum_n a_n \frac{t^n}{n!} $
but is simple to obtain that:
$latex a_n = -\frac{\left.\frac{\partial F}{\partial \dot y}\right&#124;_0}{\left.\frac{\partial F}{\partial \ddot y}\right&#124;_0} a_{n-1}-\frac{\left.\frac{\partial F}{\partial y}\right&#124;_0}{\left.\frac{\partial F}{\partial \dot y}\right&#124;_0} a_{n-2} $
it is possible, for iteration, to obtain the solution as power series near the initial point.
I think that can be generalized to higher dimension space (with more variable y,z and more derivative), but I have never verified (for example with Navier-Stokes equations).]]></description>

<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%28t%29+%3D+y_0%2B%5Cdot+y_0%2B%5Cfrac%7B%5Cddot+y%7D%7B2%7D%2B%5Csum_n+a_n+%5Cfrac%7Bt%5En%7D%7Bn%21%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y(t) = y_0+&#92;dot y_0+&#92;frac{&#92;ddot y}{2}+&#92;sum_n a_n &#92;frac{t^n}{n!} " class="latex" /><br />
but is simple to obtain that:<br />
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_n+%3D+-%5Cfrac%7B%5Cleft.%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+F%7D%7B%5Cpartial+%5Cdot+y%7D%5Cright%7C_0%7D%7B%5Cleft.%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+F%7D%7B%5Cpartial+%5Cddot+y%7D%5Cright%7C_0%7D+a_%7Bn-1%7D-%5Cfrac%7B%5Cleft.%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+F%7D%7B%5Cpartial+y%7D%5Cright%7C_0%7D%7B%5Cleft.%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+F%7D%7B%5Cpartial+%5Cdot+y%7D%5Cright%7C_0%7D+a_%7Bn-2%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a_n = -&#92;frac{&#92;left.&#92;frac{&#92;partial F}{&#92;partial &#92;dot y}&#92;right|_0}{&#92;left.&#92;frac{&#92;partial F}{&#92;partial &#92;ddot y}&#92;right|_0} a_{n-1}-&#92;frac{&#92;left.&#92;frac{&#92;partial F}{&#92;partial y}&#92;right|_0}{&#92;left.&#92;frac{&#92;partial F}{&#92;partial &#92;dot y}&#92;right|_0} a_{n-2} " class="latex" /><br />
it is possible, for iteration, to obtain the solution as power series near the initial point.<br />
I think that can be generalized to higher dimension space (with more variable y,z and more derivative), but I have never verified (for example with Navier-Stokes equations).</p>

Hi Giampiero, I am curious about the long formulas that you mention.   What kinds of equations do you find in Robotics that have long solution formulas, and what kinds of problems lead to these equations?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like your trinity of approaches, David: theoretical, formula-based and computational.  Some people may think of the first two as &#039;math&#039; and the third as &#039;computer science&#039;.  So, it&#039;s perhaps worth noting that the theoretical approach is closely linked to the computational approach.  You gave a great example here.  Your simple &lt;i&gt;algorithm&lt;/i&gt; for approximately computing the solution of

$latex X&#039;(t) = X(t), \qquad X(0) = 1$

is closely linked to the proof that a solution &lt;i&gt;exists&lt;/i&gt;.  To convert the algorithm into a proof of existence, we need to show that the approximate solution with step size $latex \epsilon$ gets closer and closer to an actual solution when $latex \epsilon \to 0.$   Conversely, we need to show this to be sure our algorithm is a good one: if chose a bad algorithm, the &#039;approximate solution&#039; might get worse and worse as $latex \epsilon \to 0.$   

Furthermore, we&#039;d really like to go a bit further, and get an estimate of &lt;i&gt;how close&lt;/i&gt; our approximation is to the actual solution, depending on the step size we choose.

All this is fairly easy for this particular differential equation... mainly because it&#039;s so famous that its solution has a name, and we all learn lots of properties of this function.  For example, every sufficiently detailed textbook on calculus includes a proof that

$latex \displaystyle{ \lim_{n \to +\infty} (1 + \frac{1}{n})^n = e}$

where $latex e$ may be defined some other way, e.g. by the property

$latex \displaystyle{ \int_1^e \frac{1}{x} \, dx = 1}$

(By the way, did you know that &lt;b&gt;E&lt;/b&gt;uler gave $latex e$ its name in a paper where the first variable was called A, the second one B, and so on, until the fifth one was the famous number &lt;b&gt;E&lt;/b&gt;?  Coincidence... or clever branding strategy?)

However, many of the same ideas generalize to differential equations of the form

$latex X&#039;(t) = f(X(t))$

where $latex f$ is any &#039;sufficiently nice&#039; function, for example any &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipschitz_continuity&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Lipschitz function&lt;/a&gt;.  We can even generalize them to equations of the form

$latex X&#039;(t) = f(X(t), t)$

where $latex f$ is continuous in both variables, and Lipschitz in the first.  This is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picard%E2%80%93Lindel%C3%B6f_theorem&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Picard existence and uniqueness theorem&lt;/a&gt;, which also lets us create algorithms for solving differential equations like this, and prove their properties.

And as you note, this idea can be used to study higher-order differential equations, since those can be viewed as systems of first-order ones.  It can also be used to study a bunch of nonlinear &lt;i&gt;partial&lt;/i&gt; differential equations, since those can be viewed as ordinary differential equations for functions taking value in a space of functions!  

(In fact this is what I used to work on, back when I was a postdoc. When U. C. Riverside hired me, they were hiring a guy who worked on nonlinear partial differential equations.)

The case of the Navier--Stokes equations is very important and frustrating.  On the theoretical side, we don&#039;t know solutions exist for all times, because the &lt;a href=&quot;http://terrytao.wordpress.com/2007/03/18/why-global-regularity-for-navier-stokes-is-hard/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;nonlinearity is too strong to apply conservation laws to prove the solutions don&#039;t blow up&lt;/a&gt;.  On the computational side, weather forecasters have trouble knowing what&#039;s the best approach to subgrid-scale modeling.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Turbulence:_Subgrid-Scale_Modeling&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Subgrid-scale modeling&lt;/a&gt; is a name for &#039;guessing how to model fluid flow on length scales smaller than our grid size&#039;.  If we knew more about the theory of the Navier--Stokes equations, we might have more systematic ways to do subgrid-scale modeling.  But apparently this area holds many mysteries.]]></description>
