&lt;blockquote&gt;

As far as the current levels of CO2 in the atmosphere, can you provide references which say that they are already too high or on the brink?

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

You should look at the Azimuth Wiki list of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Reports&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, and especially look at the 2007 IPCC report, the National Research Council report &lt;i&gt;Climate Stabilization Targets: Emissions, Concentrations, and Impacts over Decades to Millennia&lt;/i&gt;, and the &lt;i&gt;Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change&lt;/i&gt;.  They&#039;re all free online

One shorter paper that&#039;s very interesting is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Reframing+the+climate+change+challenge&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Reframing the climate change challenge in light of post-2000 emission trends&lt;/a&gt;, by K. Anderson and A. Bows. 

It&#039;s a widespread consensus among climate scientists that keeping global warming below 2 &#176;C would be a very desirable thing.  (The above reports discuss this in more depth.)  The authors argue that that even assuming the IPCC’s estimate that keeping CO2 equivalent levels below 450 ppm will suffice to accomplish this goal, the necessary 4% per year reductions in CO2 emissions beginning by 2018 are “unlikely to be politically acceptable without a sea change in the economic orthodoxy”. 

They say:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
While this analysis suggests stabilizing at 450 ppm is theoretically possible, in the absence of an unprecedented change in the global economic model and the rapid deployment of successful CO2 scrubbing technologies, 450 ppm is no longer a viable stabilization concentration. The implications of this for climate change policy, particularly adaptation, are profound. The framing of climate change policy is typically informed by the 2°C threshold; however, even stabilizing at 450 ppmv CO2e offers only a 46 per cent chance of not exceeding 2°C (Meinshausen 2006). As a consequence, any further delay in global society beginning down a pathway towards 450 ppmv leaves 2°C as an inappropriate and dangerously misleading mitigation and adaptation target.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the analysis in this paper, stabilizing at 450 ppm requires, at least, global energy related emissions to peak by 2015, rapidly decline at 6–8% per year between 2020 and 2040, and for full decarbonization sometime soon after 2050.   

The total CO2 emissions in this scenario, &lt;i&gt;over the whole history of humanity&lt;/i&gt;, would be about 860 gigatonnes.  So far emissions have been about &lt;a href=&quot;http://trillionthtonne.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;570 gigatonnes&lt;/a&gt;.   That leaves us roughly 200 more gigatonnes.  The problem is that fossil fuel reserves are already big enough to create about 2800 more gigatonnes!

Bill McKibben dramatized this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/global-warmings-terrifying-new-math-20120719?page=2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;very vividly&lt;/a&gt;.  His numbers on how much carbon we can safely burn are more optimistic, but the overall point is the same:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
 Think of two degrees Celsius as the legal drinking limit – equivalent to the 0.08 blood-alcohol level below which you might get away with driving home. The 565 gigatons is how many drinks you could have and still stay below that limit – the six beers, say, you might consume in an evening. And the 2,795 gigatons? That&#039;s the three 12-packs the fossil-fuel industry has on the table, already opened and ready to pour.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Of course none of those things will, by themselves, entirely stop CO2 emissions.  These proposals were things physicists at the Perimeter Institute might do to help, &lt;i&gt;not things that will be sufficient to solve the problem!&lt;/i&gt; 

The only proposal that might be sufficient is the last one I listed: &quot;Think outside the box&quot;.  I think nuclear power also has a hugely important role to play.

Your mention of &quot;stopping CO2 emissions entirely&quot; is presumably based on this passage from my talk:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
So, to a good approximation, to stop rising CO2 concentrations:

&#8226; Holding emissions constant is not good enough.

&#8226; Cutting them by 80% is not good enough.

&#8226; Stopping them entirely is good enough.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I believe this.   I don&#039;t believe stopping CO2 emissions entirely is the &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; option that would be good enough.   I think we will do a mixture of:

&#8226; cutting carbon emissions,

&#8226; removing CO2 from the atmosphere,

&#8226; reducing the amount of sunlight absorbed by the Earth,

&#8226; adapting to a changing climate, and

&#8226; suffering.

I suspect we&#039;ll do quite a bit of the last.]]></description>

Yes, the mass of CO2 is 3.666... times the mass of carbon it contains, so 4.3 tonnes of CO2 contains 1.13 tonnes of carbon.  Any remaining discrepancy is likely to be explained by different years at which the data were collected, and/or different methodologies.  You can click on my slides to see where I got my data.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
And you didn’t mention how much each US citizen “produces”: 19.1 tonnes, which is 6.5 times what the rest of the world produces, according to this website (why not mention that?).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I gave this version of my talk in Canada, so I said how much carbon Canadians are putting into the air: 4.2 tonnes of carbon per citizen per year, or 16 tonnes of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  In the US, I say how much US citizens are putting into the air.  But I don&#039;t want Canadians thinking it&#039;s all a US problem.

There&#039;s more to say about your other questions, but right now it&#039;s my bedtime!]]></description>

@Giampiero Campa,

While businesses may well be the &quot;machines of GDP growth&quot; they are motivated and constrained by forces peripheral of primary GDP enlargement, such as availability of capital and labor and their costs. If interest rates are near zero or below, businesses are loathe to spend because that cash will buy more tomorrow if they sit on it, with little risk. If interest rates are bit higher, they&#039;ll invest to earn, since inflation will eat away at principal. Businesses cannot really affect money or credit supply on a macro scale.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear John,
I haven&#039;t watched the video, just read the slides. Which of your proposals for physicists to work on--fun technologies, teaching methods, or modeling is :&quot;Stopping them entirely&quot; (them being CO2 emissions)? This seems like a much simpler question to answer than most questions in quantum gravity. The manufacturing of quantum dots and their integration into solar panel technology will take much energy and produce much emissions. Wind turbines also take much energy and emissions to manufacture. Neither of these lasts forever once made. And they require much other infrastructure in the form of electronics which also take energy and produce emissions in their manufacturing process. Nuclear is not exempt from the same problem, and has the other major problems of catastrophic accidents and waste disposal. See:
http://www.penguinbooksindia.com/en/content/power-promise
by my former colleague from grad school, M.V. Ramana.

And all these don&#039;t really address the problem of transportation (you did say fly less, but the cars will keep needing petroleum, and the planes would probably keep flying even if physicists boycotted them). Electric cars are probably a red herring, unless electricity can be generated without coal or petroleum in large enough quantities to feed the hungry planes and automobiles.

As far as the current levels of CO2 in the atmosphere, can you provide references which say that they are already too high or on the brink? The following website:
http://www.communitysolution.org/
claims we can still dump 10.5 billion tonnes of CO2 (1.5/person * 7 billion people) per year into the tragic commons known as the atmosphere. If that is the case, then there is still hope that a technological solution would help mitigate the effects of climate change. The website above also disagrees with you about what the average emissions per person is: he claims 4.3 tonnes vs your 1.5 tonnes. And you didn&#039;t mention how much each US citizen &quot;produces&quot;: 19.1 tonnes, which is 6.5 times what the rest of the world produces, according to this website (why not mention that?).]]></description>
