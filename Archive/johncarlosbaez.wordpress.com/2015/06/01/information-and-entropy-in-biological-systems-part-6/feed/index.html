					<description><![CDATA[I am thinking that the equation for the replicator equation, and the information geometry, can give a quantum equation: if the population equation can be write on a sphere, then these quantities are similar to the wave function in quantum mechanics; so that if the wave function are real, then the quantum mechanics coincides with the information geometry, so that a complex quantum function can give a more general dynamic.
I don&#039;t see pratical use, but if it is all right, then it is possible to write quantum equation for population wave function, and it could be possible to write population Hamiltonian, and it could be possible to build a quantum system (similar to Schrodinger equation without kinetic energy) to describe a population evolution (quantum computer with reduced noise).]]></description>

  My hypothesis is that because the work entailed here is so cutting edge (and does require some reasonable work on the part of the viewer to watch, read, and cogitate) that your work today is really for the long-tail.

Thanks, that&#039;s flattering.  I&#039;m glad there are some long-tailed scholars out there.  &lt;img src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/emoticons/tongue2.gif&quot; /&gt;

But I&#039;m always talking about pretty esoteric stuff, and usually I get more of a response.  The silence that greeted this last bunch of posts has confirmed a basic rule of mine, which is &quot;don&#039;t make people go somewhere else: explain things where you are.&quot;  Different webpages or PDF files are like different &quot;rooms&quot;---human cognition is very spatial---and people don&#039;t like being sent off to another room.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  If it helps, your influence (both through this workshop and your prior posts) has prompted me to begin delving heavily into category theory in the last week, and as a result there are about 20 others who are joining me in studying it over the coming months.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cool!  That&#039;s great!  I plan to give a year-long seminar on category theory starting in the fall, but that&#039;ll be aimed at math grad students.  Different kinds of people require different kinds of explanations, different explanations, etc.

By the way, last week&#039;s workshop on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks_isi/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Categorical Foundations of Network Theory&lt;/a&gt; was really successful.  Different people with different approaches got together and put a lot of things together.  It&#039;ll take a while to pay off, but I&#039;m very happy about it.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  Psst... you might be missing some of the conversation which is taking place on Twitter.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

True, I never follow Twitter.  Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[John, your excellent work certainly isn&#039;t going unnoticed!

I thank you not only for originally hosting the workshop, but for continuing to follow up to help it continue its life online long after the fact.  My hypothesis is that because the work entailed here is so cutting edge (and does require some reasonable work on the part of the viewer to watch, read, and cogitate) that your work today is really for the long-tail. I&#039;m sure that there are others, like me, who weren&#039;t able to trek to Tennessee for the original, but appreciate that they can relive it online.

I&#039;m sorry some of the videos didn&#039;t manage to come out. I&#039;m still distraught over Harte&#039;s not being available, though I suppose that his text is a possible stand in.

Sadly, scholarly communication isn&#039;t a more sexy profession, but fortunately we have people like you who manage to do it well. I always find myself wishing that I knew 20 more people like you who had the depth and breadth of experience in physics, mathematics, and biology.

If it helps, your influence (both through this workshop and your prior posts) has prompted me to begin delving heavily into &lt;a href=&quot;http://cat.boffosocko.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;category theory&lt;/a&gt; in the last week, and as a result there are about 20 others who are joining me in studying it over the coming months. I know that Andrew Eckford is also in the same camp.[&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/andreweckford/status/593870544224833538&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;][&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/andreweckford/status/593870774655651840&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;][&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/andreweckford/status/603705613466673152&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;] (Psst.. you might be missing some of the conversation which is taking place on Twitter.)

Thanks, as always, for the effort you&#039;ve made into these (and many other) fields, which helps pave the way for those following you!]]></description>

Yes, anyone who wants to summarize the talks should post their summaries here!

The talk authors probably won&#039;t: people hardly ever do.  &lt;i&gt;&quot;I said what I had to say, why should I say what I said?&quot;&lt;/i&gt;  If I&#039;m famous, it&#039;s largely for saying everything over and over again, in many different tones of voice.]]></description>
