Martin, I agree. By the way in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syygOaRlwNE&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt; Michael Lüders explains that the uprising against Assad was first mostly initiated people in the lower middle class in the suburbs of cities and by farmers which partially had to leave their land because of DROUGHT and other things (in german around 48:11).]]></description>

Thanks, Rob.  I &lt;a href=&quot;https://hypergeometric.wordpress.com/2015/07/13/disruption-to-global-electricity-production-during-the-next-25-years/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;already know&lt;/a&gt; about the work of &lt;a href=&quot;https://hypergeometric.wordpress.com/2015/06/12/the-solutions-project/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Jacobson and colleagues&lt;/a&gt;.

As for the rest of it, while I was engaged in some of that discussion, and remain somewhat engaged, I&#039;m increasingly frustrated with the inability of OECD governments, especially the USA, to deal with this properly. Even if it is not sufficient, I think market-based solutions &lt;a href=&quot;https://hypergeometric.wordpress.com/2015/08/10/solar-installation-progress-courtesy-of-macsolarindex-com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;driven by the plummeting costs&lt;/a&gt; of solar and wind power, creative smart-grid ideas, and the forthcoming explosion of energy storage are our best hope.  Hope these discussions are out of scope for &lt;em&gt;Azimuth&lt;/em&gt;.

Re hypergeometric:

if you havent&#039; seen it you may enjoy this study:

100% clean and renewable wind, water, and
sunlight (WWS) all-sector energy roadmaps for
the 50 United States

Similar in nature to the excellent and free book &quot;sustainability without all the hot air&quot;

Re carbon tax here is a comment I left on this blog post a while ago (http://cliffmass.blogspot.com/2015/07/carbon-tax-initiative-in-washington.html). long winded by you may find interesting:

an argument that cap and trade is preferable to a carbon tax, which we are considering here in washington state:

A carbon tax is a bad idea. Cap and Trade is better.

We have a carbon tax now. It is called the gas tax. And what is it used for? To help build roads that help us burn more gas!

Governments are no different from companies: they need to raise revenue. If you replace the B&#038;O tax, which is our states income tax (only for companies and the self employed), with a Carbon Tax, you incentivize the government to have the people Burn More Carbon. And they will. When the federal government was funded primarily by a tax of alcohol, American&#039;s consumed more than any people before or since. This is not an exaggeration. The liquor companies knew that the death of them would be the Income Tax, because the Feds wouldn&#039;t need them as a revenue source. Sure enough, after the passage of the income tax (Amendment 16 Feb 1913) prohibition soon followed. Check out Ken Burns excellent documentary on prohibition if you are interested.

Cap and trade is a better idea. First, Cliff is wrong about it not working. As he should know it has worked great in our own life times to solve the first major global environmental catastrophe faced by mankind. The Ozone hole. Look it up: Montreal Protocol. It was based on Cap and Trade. It worked!

Cap and Trade is different because it doesn&#039;t directly put money into government budgets and thus does incentivize governments to increase carbon pollution or face budget shortfalls.

There is really no such thing as a &quot;revenue neutral&quot; tax. Our revenue is generated by Sales, Property and Labor (B&#038;O) taxes , what economists call the three legs of the stool. Look at our tax receipts as the economy cycles and you will find they lag each other, tending to balance out over time. You can&#039;t just declare a tax to be revenue neutral.

If you don&#039;t believe it, consider that what I am saying is already happening: Governments in Oregon Washington and California the most progressive around on Climate, are proposing special taxes for electric vehicles because they do not pay gas tax! Nuts!

But at the end of the day Governments need to pay the bills, and if tax receipts drop because we don&#039;t have a B&#038;O and everyone puts up solar panels and drives electric cars they will need to find the money for Schools, Roads, Water, Cops, Firemen and all the other vital functions that make up a civilization somewhere: and they will be sorely tempted to figure out ways to get us to burn more fuel to generate that revenue. It sounds crazy. But the world is a crazy place. And as I say, it is already happening right now: State Governments, even in the most progressive states are disincentivizing consumers away from electric vehicles specifically because these consumers are reducing receipts from our existing carbon tax.]]></description>

&quot;World Food Supply at Growing Risk from Severe Weather&quot;

the biggest problem from climate change by far will be food production. Or rather the collision of peak population with food production. Even if we are lucky and the increase in mean temps are at the low end of IPCC projects, the impacts on impoverished people will be severe.

the article addresses server weather events, but there are numerous studies showing the negative correlation between temperature and yields of our stable crops (e.g. http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1151&#038;context=publichealthresources)

yes, this is a moral issue.]]></description>

Of course they&#039;re doing just that. Hydrocarbons release half that much CO2 than coal for the same energy output, so they can have the competition be taxed out of the market that way. Once that&#039;s accomplished, there&#039;s hardly any limit to increasing prices, so tax loss can be recovered happily. Pretty clever.

Provided, that all nuclear options are killed for good in advance, which deed is already done by the same environmental movement, so there&#039;s no need to interfere there; plus none of the so called &quot;renewable alternatives&quot; like wind or solar is tenable, which they are clearly not with their excessive price tag, pathetic intermittency and inherently huge environmental footprint due to low incoming power flux densities.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi John,
&quot;I do think that the “ecotechnology” I’m vaguely dreaming of will need to go beyond the control theory perspective (where you get a physical system to do what you want), toward something a bit more “cooperative” (where you, say, help an ecosystem flourish—i.e., do what it wants). This isn’t easy for me to formalize.&quot;

I&#039;m a philosopher (epistemology), not a mathematician, so try the folowing remarks as a step towards understanding what it is that needs formalizing.

Climate change / ecology is about the relationship between homo sapiens and his habitat. Grosso modo we have 4 ways to organize the relationship. Totemism, animism, theism and science.
- Totemism = exploiting regularities of the habitat as a guide for organizing human life. As in &quot;we, the mountainpeople, are Bear.&quot;
- Animism reverses that = exploiting regularities of human life as a guide for organizing the habitat. As in  &quot;the mountain is ill.&quot;
- Theism makes things more complicated by inserting a deity between man and habitat. As in &quot;we are stewarts of His / Her creation&quot;.
Of course all 3 are metaphorical manoeuvres. And please note that in metaphor two or more relata are related without the need / possibility to exactly identify the relata. 
- Science goes the opposite way = identifyng as exactly as possible the relata in whatever relationship under scrutiny. And please note that the role of the scientist for his people is to inform them. Whereas the role of a shaman or priest is to interfere with their doings.

Hope it helps. If not, oh well. Cordiali saluti.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi John,<br />
&#8220;I do think that the “ecotechnology” I’m vaguely dreaming of will need to go beyond the control theory perspective (where you get a physical system to do what you want), toward something a bit more “cooperative” (where you, say, help an ecosystem flourish—i.e., do what it wants). This isn’t easy for me to formalize.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a philosopher (epistemology), not a mathematician, so try the folowing remarks as a step towards understanding what it is that needs formalizing.</p>
<p>Climate change / ecology is about the relationship between homo sapiens and his habitat. Grosso modo we have 4 ways to organize the relationship. Totemism, animism, theism and science.<br />
&#8211; Totemism = exploiting regularities of the habitat as a guide for organizing human life. As in &#8220;we, the mountainpeople, are Bear.&#8221;<br />
&#8211; Animism reverses that = exploiting regularities of human life as a guide for organizing the habitat. As in  &#8220;the mountain is ill.&#8221;<br />
&#8211; Theism makes things more complicated by inserting a deity between man and habitat. As in &#8220;we are stewarts of His / Her creation&#8221;.<br />
Of course all 3 are metaphorical manoeuvres. And please note that in metaphor two or more relata are related without the need / possibility to exactly identify the relata.<br />
&#8211; Science goes the opposite way = identifyng as exactly as possible the relata in whatever relationship under scrutiny. And please note that the role of the scientist for his people is to inform them. Whereas the role of a shaman or priest is to interfere with their doings.</p>
