Since the Keeling curve starts in 1958, and doesn&#039;t show any obvious change in rate of increase around 1970, I don&#039;t see how this helps.]]></description>

P.S.: 1) N.B.: It&#039;s the trend line I &quot;start&quot; at 1970, and it does not need to cross the data point at 1970. You get the trend from the line, not from examining noisy &quot;start&quot; and &quot;end&quot; data points.

2) 1900 was 295ppm, 1940 was 310ppm (that was before the more precise Keeling measurements started). So, not much.]]></description>

(The current warming neither &quot;started in 1964&quot; nor &quot;started in 1970&quot;: Both is statistical nonsense, just like &quot;stopped 1998&quot; was.)

For an unbiased look at the data (without theory) it is obviously least erroneous to start around 1970 to get the current trend. Just minimize and homogenize the noise around the trendline (using eyballs and transparent ruler -- and don&#039;t get distracted by the red curve). In engineering there&#039;s the adage: &quot;Keep it simple, but not too simple&quot;.

For more interpretation of data, you need some theory behind the data.

The only theory we have here is Fourier&#039;s old greenhouse theory 1824. (Backed up with Tyndall&#039;s identification of the main greenhouse gases 1862, Arrhenius&#039; logarithmic formula 1896 and the Keeling curve.) Since the Keeling curve looks exponential, a linear trend is to be expected as a first unbiased estimation of things. 1970 was 330ppm, today is 400ppm, Holocene was 280ppm. Thus theory confirms my first zero-theory Bayesian approach to start at 1970.]]></description>

Sorry, I don&#039;t see why you say that we have to start at 1970 to get a number that makes sense.  Yes, the error bars are smaller in about 2008 than they are in about 1948.  How do you deduce from that that the rising anthropogenic CO2 load started making a clear difference in 1970 ?

Yes, the current warming started in 1964, but why don&#039;t you say that the rising anthropogenic CO2 load started making a clear difference in 1910, which was also (as in 1964) when the end of a cooling period was followed by the start of a warming period ?  How do you attribute the warming since 1970 (+0.04 to +0.68 =+0.64 C in 44 years) to CO2, and not the warming (from -0.46 to +0.14 = +0.60 C in 34 years) from 1910 to 1944 ?

I think that we need more error bars on the graph before we can make a claim that one warming period was due to the rising anthropogenic CO2 load, and the other was not.  Even then, the &#039;real&#039; temperature at the start or at the end of a warming period may be higher or lower than the data point.]]></description>

Many thanks for that.  The graphs of hot and cold areas in summer and winter are especially interesting.  I have generally found Real Climate to be a very responsible site.]]></description>

Because the records of global temperature :-

(a) go back far enough
(b) include warming, cooling and stasis periods, 
(c) include the ill-defined &#039;post-industrial era&#039;

that it is reasonable to assume that future trends will be close to that range, so that we will then have about 3-5 centuries from the start point to reach the two degrees target.

Some alarmists have said that the two degrees target will be reached within this century, which would require a much greater rate of global temperature increase, over a sustained period of time, than we have ever experienced before, which seems highly improbable, especially at a time when solar and oceanic cycles are at, or just past, their maximum points.]]></description>

E.g.:
Lots of 1000y and 500y hydrological events these days -consistent with the rise in atmospheric water holding capacity predicted by steam engine physicss (Clausius-Clapeyron) and the observed shift in rainfall distributions http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2012/08/extreme-metrics/

(For a graphic example that needs no statistics, here&#039;s a 1200y old temple which due to a miracle improbability did not get razed away by the rolling stones during the Great Uttarakhand Washout 2013: https://www.google.fi/search?site=imghp&#038;tbm=isch&#038;q=shiva+temple+flood
For another 2013 example close to my home, look up the Danube floodmarks on a 500y+ old building in Passau, Germany.)

But that was yesterday. Check out the (First?) Great Texan Flooding of 2015. Here the statistics is broken (suggesting a critical system transition), giving recurrence times between 5000y and 100000y, i.e. beyond the entire Holocene. See comments here: http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/2015/06/what-its-all-about.html

Now I stop commenting for a while, so y&#039;all don&#039;t see my ugly avatar head too often :-)  Flori aka Martin Gisser]]></description>

Richard, your &quot;obvious&quot; conclusion appears to be based on an assumption that the relevant rate of temperature increase a) has been, b) will continue to be in the range 0.41 to 0.69 C per century.  If so, that tees up the question:  Why do you think b) is obvious?]]></description>

&quot;Rate of increase since 1880&quot;?
Look at the Global Land-Ocean Temperature Index chart shown below: If you want a number that makes sense, start at 1970 to get the current rate of increase. That&#039;s when we left the vagaries of natural variation and measurement error (cf. green error bar) and when the rising anthropogenic CO2 load started making a clear difference. All you need is a print-out and a ruler. No math needed beyond quotients. (A nice visual exercise every sceptic should do first: It also shows that the &quot;hiatus&quot; myth always was statistical nonsense.)]]></description>
