Thanks again for the link to the paper.  I have also noticed the correlation between global temperatures and the AMO.  The correlation between global temperatures and CO2 concentrations seems to hold up less well for the 20th. century cooling (circa 1900-1910 and 1940-1950) and stasis (circa 1950-1970) periods.]]></description>

Samuel Leuenberger - Thanks, you&#039;ve uncovered a couple of my errors in interpreting Greenpeace&#039;s less-than-clear data presentation.

The label for the graph from which I took those numbers is &quot;Breakdown of non-coal power generation growth in 2014&quot;. Barring further information (which Greenpeace says is forthcoming), I interpret that as year-over-year data, not Q1 trends.

I do agree that there&#039;s not a whole lot of depth to the data presented, and that the possibility for restatement exists.

Let&#039;s look at those total again:

Hydro capacity: 110 TWh 
Hydro conditions:  66 TWh
Wind:  17 TWh
Solar:  15 TWh
Nuclear:  15 TWh
Gas/bio/waste:  34 TWh

Oh dear: TWh now GW nameplate as I&#039;d got it above....

So, taking your EIA value of 5,331 TWh total generation (608 GW sustained), then summing Greenpeace&#039;s entire pie chart (you&#039;d excluded only hydro conditions), the total is 4.8% of total generation (TWh, not GW capacity as I&#039;d misstated above).

That&#039;s actually a lot more sensible than the 17% I&#039;d come up with.

John Baez: you&#039;re going to want to update your blog post with that correction.  &lt;b&gt;[Done - JB.]&lt;/b&gt;

On the messaging...

I still maintain that Schou&#039;s grossly misstating Greenpeace&#039;s message, which as I&#039;m getting tired of stating, starts with and reiterates the fall in overall economic activity. On that point he was and remains in error.

Greenpeace&#039;s presentation of actual quantitative data here is quite wanting. They&#039;re not simply providing bottom-line numbers, their chart was poorly labeled (though I managed to mis-read the labeling that is present, on mouse-over, of quantities). We&#039;re barraged with (nameplate) capacity, total generation, share of energy, coal imports, and percentage-of-growth breakdowns, but not, say, a table simply showing total generation by mode and year for the past several years.

It&#039;s not clear that there are any credibility issues with the actual data reported, however.

The failure to clearly report on energy-related data is hardly specific to Greenpeace. It&#039;s actually a major frustration of mine with virtually all energy-based coverage, most especially in media. Reporting organizations (e.g., EIA, IEA, and BP&#039;s annual review, among others) tend to be better, though they&#039;ve generally got much longer reporting lags (see my discussion of EIA data above).

I&#039;ve done a few detailed analyses, often substantively rebutting or demolishing claims, ranging from Solar Freaking Roadways and &quot;Nautical Torque&quot; to Boeing and the general prospect of biofuels, to thorium fuel projections, and &quot;pavegen&quot;.

Why the general public, or technology reporters, or research organizations, are so entirely incapable of doing basic arithmetic is not only beyond me, but beyond annoying.

Yes, the story mentions growth of wind deployments, which ... are an all but negligible contribution. Yes, that&#039;s misleading. It&#039;s also distressingly common with all manner of green-boosterism reporting.

Truth is that the bulk of renewables contribution was 1) increased hydro capacity ,a permanent boost, but with limited further upside as China&#039;s all but tapped out its hydro potential, and 2) a fortuitous one-time favorable set of conditions for hydro overall. That&#039;s not unlike stories relating that, say, Germany saw some new milestone high rate of renewables contribution for a day, which on examination is usually some confluence of low demand (weekend or holiday idling industry) and higher-than-normal solar and/or wind generation. Those peaks are incidental and, in the larger scheme largely irrelevant.

What is relevant is that there is considerable upside potential for both wind and solar growth in China, and that total contribution from both is becoming more-than-incidental. How much further they can be scaled is a real concern, and I&#039;ve no illusions that that won&#039;t be hard, but I don&#039;t see a whole lot of choice.

There is nuclear, and that&#039;s another option for growth, but given numerous concerns (fuel, waste, proliferation, advanced technologies), my strong sense is that it&#039;s at best a helper / bridge option.

China have been making increasingly loud noises about taking environmental issues seriously (far more than India&#039;s much more disappointing behavior). And it&#039;s possible that they&#039;re serious. For all our sakes, and our descendants, if any, they&#039;d better be.

I agree that while this trend shift is promising, it&#039;s just that: a promise. Not something to bank on, yet.ï»¿

&lt;blockquote&gt; 
Remember Edward Morbius, that all your figures showing a decrease are based on Q1 data, a simple increase in China economic activity will immediatelly cancel it, notwithstanding any &quot;statistical adjustment&quot; like China likes to do.

Also keep in mind that Thermal energy production represent only 50% of China&#039;s use of coal. Concrete and Steel being the major two other consumers and are extremely sensitive to economic activity.

As for Greenpeace figures, their pie chart shows an increase of hydro, nuclear, wind, solar totaling 157TWh [1] when projections for China electricity production in 2014 were 5331 TWh (EIA). This would be 3% and interestingly close to the decrease of thermal production of 2.8% for Q1 (World Coal) [2]. That&#039;s the good news.

Where Andreas Schou is right however, is when Greenpeace is as usual touting Solar and Wind as a contributor to this decrease when we see that it is mostly due to economic slowdown and that the additional production from these two energy source account for 0.6% (32TWh) of the annual production in 2014.

To summarise, the positive shift in the Chinese energy mix towards less coal is at this time too marginal and far too susceptible to economic growth to say that we are at last going in the right direction. Also, to put things in perspective remember that last year China plugged 47GW of coal plant capacity to their grid...

[1] I am of course excluding gas and waste burning, as well as seasonnal variations in hydro power.

Good question.  I have never heard a figure quoted, but people who grow crops inside green houses add carbon dioxide to 1000 ppm, for example.

I know that some of the WWII concentration camps have cylinders of CO2 (not CO) and imply that these were used to kill people.]]></description>

I would like to know, by a climate skeptic, what is the deadly limit of carbon dioxide concentration for the mankind?
I can accept the dangerous value for the adults, or for ocean acidification (but we don&#039;t need fishes), or for high temperature; I can accept (arguments of type) that the mankind is good, and cannot lead to its destruction (so that there have been no collapses of good civilization), so that I assume that the carbon dioxide concentration increase could be due to a volcanic eruption (evil event); so that for once, can a climate skeptic give me a minimum value of the concentration of carbon dioxide lethal for the mankind?]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;The red line is an index of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, a fluctuation in the sea surface temperature in the North Atlantic Ocean with a rough âperiodâ of 70 years.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Looks a bit as if the AMO may eventually be correlated with the Chandler wobble phase flip. ?]]></description>

  Thank you for the Rohde et al (2012) reference â that is most interesting. Unfortunately, neither of your links work â do you know how I can get a copy of the paper and / or the data ?

I was only going on what the figures were telling me - CO2 started to increase dramatically in 1944, for example, while the linear trend in global temperatures in degrees C per century from 1944 to 1976 was :-

+0.09 C (NASA GISS)
-0.35 C (HadCRUT4)
+0.09 C (NOAA NCDC)

It was only from 1976 to 1998 that temperatures started to rise rapidly; then they slowed right down again, despite CO2 continuing to increase.]]></description>
