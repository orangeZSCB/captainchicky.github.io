First, sorry for not being more active here --- I have a bunch of deadlines coming up, such as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://perimeterinstitute.ca/seminar/what-entropy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;colloquium&lt;/a&gt;...

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  I like to postpone this loss of structure until we need to do it
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Personally I wholeheartedly agree with that. Ultimately, I&#039;d like to be able to do many of the things that one can do with ordered commutative monoids also for symmetric monoidal categories! But, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.03661&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;my paper&lt;/a&gt; shows that the former includes some hard functional analysis, such as the Hahn-Banach theorem.

So, in order to do completely without the loss of structure, one will have to categorify the Hahn-Banach theorem. Here&#039;s a guess as to what this could look like: given

&#8226; a symmetric monoidal category $latex \mathbf{C}$,
&#8226; a lax monoidal functor $latex p : \mathbf{C}\to Set$,
&#8226; an oplax monoidal functor $latex q : \mathbf{C}\to Set$,
&#8226;  natural transformation $latex \alpha : p \to q$ which is suitably compatible with the lax and oplax structures,

then there exists some &lt;em&gt;strong&lt;/em&gt; monoidal functor $latex f:\mathbf{C}\to Set$ such that $latex \alpha$ factors as $latex p\to f\to q$.

Does anyone know whether something like this could actually be true?]]></description>

Hi!  I like the ability to collapse a category down to a poset by saying $latex A \le B$ if there was a morphism from $latex A$ to $latex B;$ it&#039;s a nice halfway house between the category and taking the set of isomorphism classes of objects.  However, I like to postpone this loss of structure until we need to do it.  If you can prove something for categories (or monoidal categories, etc.) then you&#039;ve automatically proved it for posets (or partially ordered monoids, 
etc.).

There&#039;s a fun and probably little-read section about such ideas in &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/cohomology.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;my paper with Mike Shulman&lt;/a&gt;, section 5.1---the section called &quot;Enrichment and posets&quot;.  The paper argued that truth values are (-1)-categories, and that we can only understand how category theory connects to logic and topology if we realize this.  But this section goes further, saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  We observed in Section 2.5.3 while (-1)-categories are truth values, having only a 0-category (that is, a set) of them is a bit unsatisfactory, since it doesn&#039;t allow us to talk about implication between truth values.  The notetaker believes the best resolution to this problem is to extend the notion of &#039;0-category&#039; to include not just sets but posets. Then we can say that truth values form a poset with two elements, true and false, and a single nonidentity implication false =&#062; true. A set can then be regarded as a discrete poset, or equivalently a poset in which every morphism is invertible; that is, a &#039;0-groupoid&#039;.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

We then run with this and discuss a version of the periodic table of n-categories based on this philosophy, where the columns are truth values, posets, 2-posets (that is, categories where the homsets are partially ordered), and so on.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/05/12/resource-theories/#comment-66467&quot;&gt;Eugene Lerman&lt;/a&gt;.

Yes, I&#039;d say the term &quot;framed bicategory&quot; is a bit of a red herring.  However, the main point is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; that composition of one sort of 1-arrows is &#039;not quite associative&#039;!

It&#039;s true that composition of bimodules is associative only up to coherent isomorphism.  And it&#039;s true that we should generalize double categories to allow that kind of situation.  But a double category where composition of (say) horizontal 1-arrows is associative only up to coherent isomorphism is called a &lt;b&gt;pseudo double category&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;weak double category&lt;/b&gt;, or sometimes, by very modern people, just a &lt;b&gt;double category&lt;/b&gt;.   There&#039;s a theorem saying that every pseudo double category is equivalent to an ordinary double category (it&#039;s Theorem 7.5 in &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.numdam.org/ARCHIVE/CTGDC/CTGDC_1999__40_3/CTGDC_1999__40_3_162_0/CTGDC_1999__40_3_162_0.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Grandis and Pare&lt;/a&gt;).  So this issue winds up being no big deal, except at a technical level.

The idea of &#039;framing&#039; is rather different, and more substantial.  If you look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1286&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Mike Shulman&#039;s paper&lt;/a&gt; he says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  Morally speaking, a framed bicategory is a double category in which the 1-cells can be restricted and extended along the vertical arrows.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The paper looks a bit scary if you read it from the beginning, but since you know what a double category is, I suggest you go to Theorem 4.1 and take condition (iii) as the definition of a framed bicategory.  It&#039;s a double category where each vertical arrow can be turned into a horizontal one in two ways, mimicking how a ring homomorphism $latex f : A \to B$ gives rise both to an $latex (A,B)$-bimodule and a $latex (B,A)$-bimodule!

Another good example is the double category with sets as objects, functions as vertical arrows and spans as horizontal arrows.  A function $latex f : A \to B$ can be turned into a span from $latex A$ to $latex B$ in an obvious way, but also into a span from $latex B$ to $latex A.$

There are lots of other examples, listed in Shulman&#039;s paper.  So while the name &#039;framed bicategory&#039; annoys me a bit, the concept does not.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.0993&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;More recently&lt;/a&gt; Shulman has been using the term &#039;fibrant double category&#039; for the same concept.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi John, the loss of structure is on purpose.  While the passage from algebraic (i.e. order-theoretic) logic to categorical logic is all about passing from &lt;code&gt;can we prove this&#039; to&lt;/code&gt;how can we prove this&#039;, here it&#039;s the opposite, we are really only interested in the `can&#039; part. This compression is in the same spirit as assigning a measure to something e.g. entropy, cost, energy.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi John, the loss of structure is on purpose.  While the passage from algebraic (i.e. order-theoretic) logic to categorical logic is all about passing from <code>can we prove this' to</code>how can we prove this&#8217;, here it&#8217;s the opposite, we are really only interested in the `can&#8217; part. This compression is in the same spirit as assigning a measure to something e.g. entropy, cost, energy.  However, for many measures the main thing of interest is what is more than what, rather than the actual number, and in some cases an additional monoid structure like addition in the case of money is crucial.  That is, the manner in which things compose.  So that&#8217;s how the ordered monoid pops up.  Also, some things simply don&#8217;t compare, and therefore unlike a measure which induces a total order, here one allows for a partial order.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[John,

Before I go and read the manual, could you clear up one thing for me?

Is the term &quot;framed bicategory&quot; a bit of a red herring? In the sense that a framed bicategory  in your example (rings and bimodules) does not appear to be a bicategory.  Rather it looks like a generalization of a double category, with the composition of one sort of 1-arrows not quite associative.  Is this right?]]></description>

  There are a number of methods for building a resource theory (i.e. an SMC) from a partitioned process theory. The unifying idea though, is that your new SMC has the processes $latex f,g$ as objects, and morphisms $latex f \to g$ ways of using the free processes to build $latex g$ from $latex f.$
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I haven&#039;t read your paper yet, and I should, but I&#039;ll just ask the obvious question here.

It&#039;s a bit of a &#039;level shift&#039; to start treating morphisms as objects and look at morphisms between those.  If you just take your morphisms, treat them as objects in a new category, and start defining morphisms between those, you&#039;ve thrown out a lot of interesting stuff: namely, your ability to &lt;i&gt;compose&lt;/i&gt; your original morphisms.

The most famous way around this is to build a bicategory where you now have 2-morphisms going between your original morphisms.    Of course, this only works if all your new morphisms-between-morphisms go between morphisms having the same source and target: if we have $latex f, g : x \to y$ we can now talk about $latex \alpha : f  \Rightarrow g.$

I bet you need more flexibility here---right?  If a morphism from $latex f$ to $latex g$ is &#039;a way to use free processes to build $latex g$ from $latex g$&#039;, there&#039;s no reason $latex f$ and $latex g$ should have the same source and target.

So, one option is to consider a &lt;a href=&quot;http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/double+category&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;double category&lt;/a&gt;.  For example, you could make one where the vertical arrows are your original morphisms and the horizontal ones are your &#039;free processes&#039;: morphisms in some subcategory.  There&#039;s an easy obvious way to build such a double category.

A similar sort of situation led Shulman to develop &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1286&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;framed bicategories&lt;/a&gt;: for example, you have both homomorphisms between rings, and bimodules between rings, and the former is a special case of the latter.  Is this what you were alluding to?]]></description>
