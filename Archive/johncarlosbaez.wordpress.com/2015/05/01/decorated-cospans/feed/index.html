					<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s a paper on categories where the morphisms are open physical systems, and composing them describes gluing these systems together:

• John C. Baez, David Weisbart and Adam Yassine, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.11392&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Open systems in classical mechanics&lt;/a&gt;.

The basic idea is by now familiar to fans of this blog---but there are some big twists!  I like treating open systems as &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2019/07/01/structured-cospans/&quot;&gt;cospans with extra structure&lt;/a&gt;.  But in this case it makes more sense to use &lt;em&gt;spans&lt;/em&gt;, since the phase space of a classical system maps &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; the phase space of any subsystem.   We&#039;ll compose these spans using pullbacks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You may have heard of a similar idea: &#039;&lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/05/01/decorated-cospans/&quot;&gt;decorated cospans&lt;/a&gt;’, invented by Brendan Fong.   You may wonder what&#039;s the difference!

&lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/SYCO4/courser_syco4.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Kenny&#039;s talk&lt;/a&gt; explains the difference pretty well.  Basically, decorated cospans that look isomorphic may not be technically isomorphic.  There are just not enough isomorphisms between decorated cospans.  As Kenny explains, structured cospans don&#039;t suffer from this problem.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The monoidal Grothendieck construction plays an important role in our team&#039;s work on network theory, in at least two ways. First, we use it to get a symmetric monoidal category, and then an operad, from any &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2017/10/31/complex-adaptive-systems-part-6/&quot;&gt;network model&lt;/a&gt;. Second, we use it to turn any decorated cospan category into a &#039;structured cospan category&#039;. I haven&#039;t said anything about structured cospans yet, but they are an alternative approach to open systems, developed by my grad student Kenny Courser, that I&#039;m very excited about. Stay tuned!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[But I want to say here what we do in our paper, because it&#039;s pretty cool and it took a few years.  To get things to work, we needed my student Brendan Fong to invent the right category-theoretic formalism: &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/05/01/decorated-cospans/&quot;&gt;&#039;decorated cospans&#039;&lt;/a&gt;.

I thought a normal vector field, where the points and the vectors are the decorated cospans (the arrows of the cospans like real vectors), so that graph and flow curves can coincides with a limit of close distance of the vector field representation.

If it is so, then many theorems of the decorated cospans can be applied to the vector fields (with some limits), and vice versa.]]></description>
