P.S.: My &quot;customers&quot; were in the lucky (but under appreciated) situation to have fast &quot;feedback from reality&quot;: Every month (or week?) we got a time series of real vs. prognosis. At least my 2 peers and me were discussing it and what needed improvement (Bundesnetzagentur wants 15min precision; some slopes make problem; etc. (BTW watch out doing one year in 15min steps in MS Excel: Around line 10786 you get a rounding error. Srsly.)). So, the result counted (could have), not the method.

The point is: Customer cares about money, and can&#039;t even really handle this (dunno if the budget box-thinking is typical German only). I.e. often even the tactical reasoning is lacking due to oversimplification and backwards clinging. Caring about reality (strategico-logistical thinking) would be too much to expect of the poor suits&#039; busy brains. (I am now officially giving up on this waste of time. Heck, the planet is burning...)]]></description>

Well, there&#039;s not much more to tell.

The prognosis job as I found it had been set up and done for some 2y by someone who fell very sick then, and I was hired just as a long-temporary ersatz (yes, we Germans are LAO over Obamacare!). At the end I have not fought for keeping the job, as I haven&#039;t been there for long, plus actually I&#039;m not the early bird type (doing 2 hours hardcore data crunching before breakfast!) My 2 experienced peers shrugged shoulders and sighed - as they were doing almost every week upon latest news of the big bosses&#039; decisions (like, quitting a stored hydro extension project, or, investing with some slick Brazilean billionaire).

The big bosses knew the job was necessary and required and monitored by the German federal grid agency (Bundesnetzagentur). Possibly they even got complaints, if not fined half a million by the agency for mediocre prognosis. (There was one complaint one day when I was still being trained - the grid got to the edge of overload due to a solar data glitch.) --- But at that time they didn&#039;t care and were dragging heels in the inevitable German Energiewende. Only recently they seemed to have got a clue:  http://www.tagesschau.de/wirtschaft/eon-neuausrichtung-101.html (The German Energieminister cum Vizekanzler plus the Barvarian Ministerpräsident seem to still not get the Energiewende thing. There could be a bad awakening: The company is too big to fail.)

What ever: The first thing to do when they need to save money is to get rid of heads. Anyhow, right before I came they had hired external experts for 10x the money, so this budget was overdrawn - even while my pay was negligible: This is classical automatic dyscalculia of the bean counters. No chance. Move on.

I haven&#039;t looked back and not yet asked the guys how things are doing there today.

-----
BTW right now I should **look for yet another new job**. But I&#039;m thoroughly fed up with wasting brain for the bean counters. I now want to keep it for myself to do private math. Now looking for a 400€+ job as organic pig shepherd. **Seriously!** I&#039;m an expert in throwing pearls to pigs. They love it. And I love them for having fun. Alternatively, I also love gardening. Ideally an apprenticeship in organic farming. Munich West (Allach/Gröbenzell) or Bayerischer Wald.

Thank you &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much for your interesting re-cap on forecasting of electricity loads. 

I wonder how much, in your immediate experience, the lack of appreciation for your forecasts happened because the audience of users did not understand the problem, or did not understand the methods and, so, considered them equivalent to any &lt;em&gt;ad hoc&lt;/em&gt; technique they could come up with?

I find it common in my own applications that consumers of my results want to know why they should trust them, when they haven&#039;t the data or the time to develop a track record.  It is difficult to convey that if the data, however limited are good, and everything I&#039;ve been told is correct, and I have not made mistakes in modeling,  the prediction is the best we can have, based upon principles.  Sure, if it matters, I can develop alternative models,  switch in different priors, and so on, and see where the forecasts land relative to one another. But the idea of &quot;correct by construction&quot; is something which seems to elude users.

Care to comment?]]></description>

Thanks for the links and reminding me of this stuff! It might indeed be a problem set for Azimuthers...

I don&#039;t know much details and I&#039;m not an engineer --- But in 2012 I was working 6 months for a major German company doing the daily electricity load forecast for Bavaria. It was yet another job validating my rule of thump about Tsherman industry: They are not interested in intelligence. Wasting billions with bad business and dragging heels is preferred over investing millions in smart heads. (And their biggest dream always is automating intelligence. Heck, even in software industry, where the programmerz are the first to get laid off, not the bean counters.)

My job description was: Check the data streams early morning, feed them into black boxes (Kalman filter, neural network), check results for plausibility and report to grid operator. Afternoon I had for quality control and tweaking parameters of the black boxes. (Evening I dreamt of infinite dimensional Kalman filters, Gaussian process machine learning, etc. etc.)

Soon I was able to beat the black boxes by semi-automated eyeballing of historical data and doing a weighted average using just Microsoft Excel. Then my peers were also starting to improve things, e.g. getting a better solar prognosis, which was at the time based on Munich airport representing the whole area of Bavaria, which grew exceedingly stupid given the massive ramp up of solar power in Bavaria (still more than whole U.S. perhaps). The prognosis also turned out helpful for accounting data quality control. It could have saved them a few millions...

But heck, peanuts, as the German banker once said!

So, the big bosses weren&#039;t interested and not even asking the world-class expert sharing my office. The whole prognosis job got moved north (who were performing worse) - and the switch was done December 31, my last day of work and technically the hardest: This was the worst day for a prognosis, and then even some data stream ripped, as happens at such dates. But the bosses didn&#039;t care. Heck, we didn&#039;t even do a parallel overlap to co-check results, no, we just switched the job north from one day to the next, during the most exceptional holidays. Luckily no brownout happened. Just heat up enough coal baseload backup...]]></description>

<p>So, the big bosses weren&#8217;t interested and not even asking the world-class expert sharing my office. The whole prognosis job got moved north (who were performing worse) &#8211; and the switch was done December 31, my last day of work and technically the hardest: This was the worst day for a prognosis, and then even some data stream ripped, as happens at such dates. But the bosses didn&#8217;t care. Heck, we didn&#8217;t even do a parallel overlap to co-check results, no, we just switched the job north from one day to the next, during the most exceptional holidays. Luckily no brownout happened. Just heat up enough coal baseload backup&#8230;</p>
