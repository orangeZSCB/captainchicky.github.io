It goes a bit off-topic. (Feel free to e-mail me - my address can be found easily.) BTW: Click &quot;reply&quot; under a post you want to respond to, rather than start a separate message - it can make it easier to group this discussion, rather than have it scattered.

Data science is a good career. In Poland there are some data science jobs (not many data visualization, though), but it is possible to work remotely. Most of my contracts are from people in other places (especially - California). Though, I still need to learn how to juggle my scientific interests and earning (it may be wiser to ask me in a year or so).]]></description>

It&#039;s not just a curious coincidence: the same underlying mathematics is at work in both cases.  Namely, the fact that the rotation group SO(3) is not simply connected, but has a simply-connected double cover.  Here&#039;s an introduction:

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_trick&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Plate trick&lt;/a&gt;, Wikipedia.

I call it the coffee cup trick, since it&#039;s easy to illustrate with a coffee cup.

This page goes a bit deeper:

I am thinking (I don&#039;t know if it is true) that could be possible a single photon spectroscopy.
If there is a quantum tunneling, then there is a creation of a bound state (photon-electron) for a time given by the Heisenberg&#039;s uncertainty principle, so that there is a time delay in the photon trajectory; for example it could be measured the phase difference between two photon (one that interact with the charged molecule, and the other in the free space), and the time delay could give information on the difference in molecular energy levels, like the usual spectroscopy (using the time delay).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My first head on collision with quantum weirdness was a paper basket.

Electrons are famous for having a nearly inexplicable property. They do not assume the same state after a 360° rotation, as ordinary objects do. They need two full rotations, 720° to accomplish that.

And here comes the paper basket. You have to attach it by four elastic strings to the four vertices of a tetrahedron, like pegs in the opposite corners of a room at the ceiling and two more at the ends of the other diagonal on the floor.

If you rotate the paper basket by 360°, it may get back to its original position, but the strings become entangled hopelessly, so its state can clearly be distinguished from its former one. However, another full rotation does a miracle. In this case, with some moderate skill, you can disentangle the strings completely, so the state of the entire configuration becomes indistinguishable from its original one.

Question: is there a deeper connection between electrons an paper baskets held in place by strings or is it just a curious coincidence?]]></description>

Protons, as such, are indistinguishable. But once they are localized in certain positions we could treat them as is they were distinguishable. For example, a proton in my head is indistinguishable from a proton on Mars. Yet, as long they don&#039;t interfere with each other, it does matter whether they are distinguishable or not.

But, for the sake of this post, you can think of it as an electron  being near to a proton, on the right (vs &quot;near to the proton on the right&quot;). That is:

p+  p+ e-

vs

e- p+ p+

(makes sense even if protons are indistinguishable).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;I wouldn’t make such statements. Especially we may be talking about different aspects of empathy.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I wrote: &lt;em&gt;&quot;Let’s assume that your observation would reflect the average emotional intelligence within math/physics groups and in particular that affective empathy and prosocial behaviour would also be lower than average in math/physics crowds.&quot;&lt;/em&gt; because the article “Prosocial reasoning and empathy in gifted children” speaks about prosocial behaviour and &lt;em&gt;affective empathy.&lt;/em&gt;
So I so to say left what seems to be called &quot;cognitive empathy&quot; and &quot;theory of mind&quot; out and as I wrote it is an assumption.

&lt;blockquote&gt;I would take any anecdotal evidence (here: mine) with a grain of salt.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sure a personal impression is certainly not a study. Apart from that 
the article “Prosocial reasoning and empathy in gifted children” mentions that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Despite the promising indications that the academic gifted students used higher levels of prosocial reasoning and that they had higher levels of affective empathy, further research needs to be conducted to confirm these results.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Moreover the article: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cog.psy.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/papers/2007/Rogers%282007%29_JAutismDevDisord.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Who Cares? Revisiting Empathy in Asperger Syndrome&lt;/a&gt; mentions that (as I understood in contrast to people with autism) people with Asperger syndrome may have no deficit in affective empathy (but then the study was peformed only with 21 persons and 21 controls). Moreover as the study &quot; “Assessing emotional intelligence in gifted and non-gifted high school students: Outcomes depend on the measure” says the judgements seem to depend rather highly on which aspect one is looking for. Nevertheless it seems (thats also what I heard from non mathematicians) that especially math departments may often be perceived as rather &quot;beyond the nerd stage&quot;, even if there may also rather &quot;normal&quot; types be running around and some of them may even just be pretending. I think this may certainly be something which should be taken into consideration, likewise assessing what types of &quot;extraordinary behaviour&quot; may to be expected is eventually also helpful, especially for the young students.

Thanks for the links, I found that strange statement of &lt;a href=&quot;https://woodtickquarterly.wordpress.com/2011/11/17/graham-farmelo-the-strangest-man-the-hidden-life-of-paul-dirac-quantum-genius/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Marcin Kotowski&lt;/a&gt; quite funny:

&lt;blockquote&gt;....blunting of one’s ambition is the first symptom of senility.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Anyways another question.
