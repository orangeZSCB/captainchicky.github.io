					<description><![CDATA[This May, a small group of mathematicians is going to a workshop on the categorical foundations of network theory, or Jacob Biamonte. I’m trying to get us mentally prepared for this. We all have different ideas, yet they should fit together somehow.

Tobias Fritz, Eugene Lerman and David Spivak have all written articles here about their work, though I suspect Eugene will have a lot of completely new things to say, too. Now it’s time for me to say what my students and I have doing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/03/27/spivak-part-1/#comment-65353&quot;&gt;Tobias Fritz&lt;/a&gt;.

To add to this interesting discussion, I thought I might mention James Gibsons&#039; The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception for a view of information which has takers in the Embodied Cognition community (for a brief on embodied cognition see: M. Anderson, Embodied cognition: A field guide, &lt;em&gt;Artificial Intelligence&lt;/em&gt; &lt;b&gt;149&lt;/b&gt; (2003)).

In the book, Gibson mostly talks about perceptual information. Roughly speaking, according to Gibson, (optical) information are invariant structures in energy arrays (structured arrangement of light with respect to a point of observation) dependent on the event that caused it. It is something external to the observer (that becomes available as soon as light fills up a volume). Optical information is not something that is processed or transmitted, rather, a nervous system &#039;resonates&#039; to it (as behaviour) when it passes through a given energy array.

I&#039;d also like to mention a very interesting paper: Thelen et al. The dynamics of embodiment: a field theory of infant perseverative reaching, Behavioral and Brain Sciences 24 (2001). The paper provides an interesting explanation of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-not-B_error&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;A-not-B error&lt;/a&gt; from the embodied dynamical systems perspective.

(disclaimer: I am not a cognitive scientist but a math grad student with an unhealthy interest in the subject)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It is an interesting post.
I read a summary of an article on a research of Rodrigo Quian Quiroga, where a single neuron identify a person; so I thought (superficially) that the same process can be applied to each information in the brain (there are single neuron that are activated by a real, or abstract, concept), so that when happen that a person sees some visual features, then a first level words are activates (the shape of the face, the eye color, the hair color, etc), and a combination in a complex proposition generate the activation of the neuron.
I think that the though is a simple chemical reaction, so that it can be that the brain is an evolution of an elementary process of bacteria, and virus, that reasoning with chemical reaction, and the dna like a chemical brain that contain the possible reactions.
A network of perceptrons could contain the sentences of a grammar, without syntax verbs and adjectives, with a neurons that contain verbs, adjectives, nouns and that are activated by the senses.
If the network is great, and near a critical point, so that a little variation of the sense (or a little variations of the inner neurons) a spontaneous dynamic could be activated, and a reasoning on itself could be activated (like a Ising model), something similar to the consciousness, that could be (in this case) a parallel process on a logical network.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/03/27/spivak-part-1/#comment-65388&quot;&gt;dspivak&lt;/a&gt;.

I think that when talking about &quot;tigers on your left&quot;, we can get by with just assuming pragmatics of display behaviors, without any prior semantics or knowledge of tigers as an ontological type. The speaker is talking about something in the immediate (or proximal) situation, and drawing the attention of the Hearer to something at issue. By looking to the Hearer&#039;s left (or following the gaze of the Speaker), the Hearer&#039;s attention will focus on something big and scary, and will be able to take action. Maybe this is how the Hearer learns for the first time what the sign &quot;tiger&quot; could be referring to. From the pragmatics of display behaviors, specifically vocalization displays and a powerful declarative long-term memory for the forms and significance of signs, hominids evolve full blown linguistic pragmatics.

Within the species capacity of language pragmatics, I think semantics, in the typical sense of the word as used in logic and math, comes out primarily in relation to using utterances in some proximal situation to draw Hearer (or Reader) attention to some distal situation, past present or future. (Language involves some kind of information channel from proximal situations with utterances to distal situations, actual or hypothetical, classified by the semantic content of the utterance.) Semantics solves the more civilized problem of how can a hominid discover or construe the intended content (&quot;what is said&quot;) of an expression, relying only on the bare minimum of the utterance and shared knowledge of lexical items and constructions. It allows sophisticated speakers to construct utterances that could be understood by the entire speech community using the shared lexical/grammatical knowledge, abstracting away from the specifics of a pragmatic situation with particular speakers and factual circumstances. The semantic content is what can be constructed from the utterance and shared prior knowledge of language, independent of pragmatic details of usage. Mathematics works this way as well, with the additional aspiration that well-defined signs and formulas have a determinate content. In contrast, natural languages thrives on having overloaded signs, with rich polysemous meanings. This is not a design defect, it is what Jon Barwise called the efficiency of language.

I am hopeful that category theory (including the Chu spaces studied by Barwise and Seligman, 1997) and type theory can provide a specification language for both pragmatics and semantics. I am not able to envision a typical scientist or mathematician adopting such a precise language in their blogs, but I can imagine it powering analytical engines beneath a more user-friendly natural-language interface. Such an implemented system could help overcome the pitfalls of ambiguous language by fixing the construal of expressions in terms of a clearly specified framework of mostly-deductive lexical and constructional semantics, with a capability for ampliative or abductive inference in the underlying pragmatics. We could have libraries of clear thinking, from which ordinary scientists and lay people, could construct discourse, agree on problems and coordinate solutions. For example, it could help the selective divestment movement convince listed companies and national governments to gradually write off the &quot;value&quot; of the proven coal and oil reserves, a stranded asset in any world that mitigates climate change.]]></description>

That&#039;s fine; the &quot;zooming-in&quot; idea, where we can put nodes as black boxes under a microscope to reveal more internal structure (somewhat reminiscent of the cover of the Quantum Field Theory book by Peskin and Schroeder) just put me strongly in mind of this.

					<description><![CDATA[Gerard, I very much agree that it should be quite useful to look to evolution. We&#039;re talking about &quot;group selection&quot;, which means that by cooperating better than other groups, we can increase our chances of out-competing them.

Language allows us to coordinate, order-together, our actions. Working together to solve problems is pretty powerful. But ants do this without our kind of language. Our kind of language is also very fungible and extendable. We can use it like sorcerers to do all sorts of amazing things.

How can we account for this power? I haven&#039;t heard of robots who can use, let alone invent, languages for their thinking. I don&#039;t think we understand well enough what language is, or what semantics is, to do so.

The only thing I think I disagree with you about is the idea that just because we know that evolution led to language, i.e., by helping us survive, that this provides any clue about what language or semantics is. I&#039;m not sure if you&#039;re saying that it does or not. But I think by talking about &quot;tigers on your left&quot;, you&#039;re already assuming semantics. We need to know what &quot;tiger&quot;, as a semantic notion, &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt;. Would you agree?

For me, the most useful thing to understand in evolution is the jump from prokaryote to eukaryote, and the jump from eukaryote to multicellular organism. What kind of proto-communication led to these jumps?]]></description>

Hi Todd, I&#039;m not thinking about anything quite that fancy, though it sounds pretty interesting. I&#039;m just thinking about the operadic nature of string diagrams: you can plug a string diagram into each morphism-box of a string diagram.

For example (as I&#039;ll mention in part 3 of this 3-part Azimuth post), the operad for traced monoidal categories is (roughly) the one underlying the monoidal category 1-Cob of oriented cobordisms between 0-manifolds. If you draw an oriented 0-manifold as a box with negatively-oriented points as incoming wires and positively-oriented points as outgoing wires, you&#039;ll see how it works. The only roughness in my &quot;roughly&quot; has to do with object-sets (1-Cob/{*} really gives you the category of traced monoidal categories whose objects are in bijection with the monoid of natural numbers} and 2-cells between traced monoidal functors.]]></description>
