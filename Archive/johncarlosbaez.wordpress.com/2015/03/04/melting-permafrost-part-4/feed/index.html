I wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;but that would then mean that of the $latex 2*10^{10} km^2 $you cited above as total global land permafrost surface &lt;/blockquote&gt;

oops a typo you cited of course $latex 2*10^7 km^2$ or in other words &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.the-cryosphere.net/6/221/2012/tc-6-221-2012.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;S.Gruber says in the abstract:&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The global permafrost region, i.e. the exposed land surface below which some permafrost can be expected, is estimated to be $latex 22 \pm 3 * 10^6 km^2$.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But then this seems to be different from what is called &quot;global permafrost area&quot;, because this is about the same size or even smaller (which is strange because you would think that it includes land permafrost, or is it a typo?). That is S. Gruber writes in the sentence before:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The global permafrost area including Antarctic and sub-sea permafrost is estimated to be $latex 16 - 21 * 10^6 km^2.$&lt;/blockquote&gt;

You wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Gruber estimate for the north 60 degree Sud is 13-18 millions of km^2 (without Antarctica and subsea ), so that the estimate are near.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yes that is closer to the 10.5 million from the Wiki for the northern hemissphere.

But then in the link you gave at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/frozenground/whereis_fg.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;National Snow and Ice Data Center&lt;/a&gt; under the titel:
&quot;Where is frozen ground in the Northern Hemisphere?&quot; it says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Permafrost exists where the ground stays at or below 0Â° Celsius (32Â° Fahrenheit) for at least two years in a row. 24 percent of the land in the Northern Hemisphere has permafrost underneath it (Figure 1). So, permafrost makes up 23 million square kilometers (9 million square miles).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

May it be that those different areas are due to different definitions of &quot;land under permafrost&quot;, &quot;permafrost area&quot;, &quot;exposed land surface below which some permafrost can be expected&quot; ? That is seabed permafrost may be called &quot;land that has permafrost underneath it&quot;?]]></description>

The Gruber data give 16-22 million km^2, but I think that the measure have some uncertainty (there is a measured seabed permafrost), but the measure of the Climate Service Center is for the Norther Hemisphere; the permafrost is present in the Southern Hemisphere:
https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/frozenground/whereis_fg.html
in the seabed, in Antarctica, South America and New Zealand; so that the difference can be due to different definitions. The Gruber estimate for the north 60 degree Sud is 13-18 millions of km^2 (without Antarctica and subsea ), so that the estimate are near.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;But I still can’t recover his factor 2, seems he made some special temperature assumptions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I should also add that my volume assumptions is rather an outer
bounding box and he took probably an average size. Anyway up to one of order of magnitude his result seems to be to me now plausible.

Considering the size of permafrost thawing here is a -what looks like a rather helpful link about
&lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.bildungsserver.de/klimawandel/index.php/Methan_im_Permafrost&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Methane in permafrost.&lt;/a&gt; It is in german though. It&#039;s a wiki which gathers climate change info&#039;S like the Azimuth project. The wiki itself seems to be funded by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.climate-service-center.de/index.html.en&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;climate service center&lt;/a&gt; and the public german information portal It says that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Modellprojektionen ergeben eine Verringerung der Permafrostgebiete der Nordhemisphäre bis 2080 um ca. ein Drittel. Die Ausdehnung der zusammenhängenden Permafrostzone von gegenwärtig 10,5 könnte sich sogar auf etwa 1 Million $latex km^2$ reduzieren. Außerdem wird die saisonale Tiefe des Auftaubodens um bis zu 50% und mehr zunehmen.[2]
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

where [2] is:
↑ Lawrence, D.M., and A.G. Slater (2005): A projection of severe near-surface permafrost degradation during the 21st century, Geophys. Res. Lett., 32

translation without guarantee:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Until 2080 models reveal a decrease of permafrost land in the northern hemissphere by roughly one third. The extension of the permafrost zone from now 10,5 could go down to 1 million $latex km^2.$ Apart from that the seasonal depth of the permafrost soil could raise by 50% and more[2]&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

where I don&#039;t understand what they mean with &quot;extension of the permafrost zone&quot;, that is I would assume that they mean by that the whole surface of land permafrost in the northern hemissphere, but that would then mean that of the $latex 2*10^{10} km^2$ you cited above as total global land permafrost surface only $latex 10^7 km^2$ is in the northern hemissphere, that sounds strange.
Moreover 1 million is not one third of 10 million. 
So what do they mean by that? One should probably look into the article, but as you I don&#039;t have access to those.

and

&lt;blockquote&gt;Wenn Permafrost im Sommer oberflächlich auftaut, wird bei der Zersetzung von organischem Material Kohlendioxid gebildet und unter anaeroben Bedingungen, z.B. unter der Wasseroberfläche, Methan (CH4). Beim nächsten Gefrieren werden beide Kohlenstoffverbindungen im gefrorenen Boden gespeichert. Die gesamte im Permafrost der Nordhalbkugel gespeicherte Menge an Kohlenstoff wird auf etwa 1000 Gigatonnen[3] C geschätzt,[4] nach neueren Schätzungen sogar auf 1672 Gigatonnen und damit auf die Hälfte des weltweiten Kohlenstoffs im Boden.[5]
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[3] is the explanation that 1 gigton is $latex 10^{12} kg$ and [4]
is: 
↑ Zimov, S.A., E.A.G. Schuur, and F.S. Chapin III (2006): Permafrost and the Global Carbon Budget, Science 312, 1612-1613
and [5] is:
↑ Tarnocai, C., et al: (2009): Soil organic carbon pools in the northern circumpolar permafrost region, Global Biochemical Cycles 23, doi:10.1029/2008GB003327

translation without guarantee:

&lt;blockquote&gt; When the surface of permafrost thaws in summer  then upon the decay of organic material carbondioxide is produced and if there are anaerobic conditions like under water  then methane (CH4) is produced. When the soil freezes again both carbon compounds are stored in the soil. The total amount of carbon is estimated [4] at roughly 1000 gigatons C [3] and therefore to be half of the estimated carbon in soil.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;When the soil freezes again both carbon compounds are stored in the soil. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

...where I wonder how much of that is really kept in the soil.]]></description>

<p>[3] is the explanation that 1 gigton is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5E%7B12%7D+kg&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="10^{12} kg" class="latex" /> and [4]<br />
is:<br />
↑ Zimov, S.A., E.A.G. Schuur, and F.S. Chapin III (2006): Permafrost and the Global Carbon Budget, Science 312, 1612-1613<br />
and [5] is:<br />
↑ Tarnocai, C., et al: (2009): Soil organic carbon pools in the northern circumpolar permafrost region, Global Biochemical Cycles 23, doi:10.1029/2008GB003327</p>
<p>translation without guarantee:</p>
<blockquote><p> When the surface of permafrost thaws in summer  then upon the decay of organic material carbondioxide is produced and if there are anaerobic conditions like under water  then methane (CH4) is produced. When the soil freezes again both carbon compounds are stored in the soil. The total amount of carbon is estimated [4] at roughly 1000 gigatons C [3] and therefore to be half of the estimated carbon in soil.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>When the soil freezes again both carbon compounds are stored in the soil. </p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;where I wonder how much of that is really kept in the soil.</p>

I haven&#039;t seen the remark before it was deleted.  But with all due respect, the Inuit didn&#039;t end up in a place like Grise Fiord just because they thought it would be a great place to live.

...and if one would take the ideal gas law as an Ansatz and assumes constant temperature than a factor of 10 in pressure would scale the Volume (and thus the density by the inverse) rather by $latex 10^{-1}$ and not $latex 10^{-3}$ as I had guessed a bit too fast. But I still can&#039;t recover his factor 2, seems he made some special temperature assumptions.]]></description>

I just saw that the &quot;Shakhova event&quot; is actually not $latex 10^15 g$ as I had used above but 50 times that quantity.
So that would make 50000 holes necessary in the &quot;hole calculation&quot; instead of $latex 1000$ and a depth of  $latex 50*5cm=2.50m$ for the permafrost calculation. This is still not very much, especially with regard to the fact that the holes can be $latex 100m$ deep.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;I think that it is not important the methane content in the well before the explosion, that could be a sporadic event.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Well as you said it &quot;can give an information on the release.&quot; That is I guess the main point is the question how much methane is there lurking in the permafrost, like how deep are the methane layers and how much are they compressed.

If one takes the $latex 10^3 g/m^3 $ density of methane at normal pressure then $latex 10^{15}g$ (the &quot;Shakhtova weight&quot;) require a volume of $latex 10^{12} m^3$ if I didn&#039;t miscalculate and since $latex (0.5*10^{-1}m)*2*10* 10^{12}m^2 = 10^{12} m^3$ this would mean that one would need a depth of 5 cm methane in all the roughly $latex 2*10* 10^{12}m^2$ of permafrost you cited above (if it would all melt) in order to provoke a &quot;Shakhtova event&quot;.]]></description>
