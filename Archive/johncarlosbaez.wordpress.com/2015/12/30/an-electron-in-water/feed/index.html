Your egg carton model, with quantum mechanics taken into account, sounds right.

I don&#039;t know what that characteristic energy is.  It might say somewhere in &lt;a href=&quot;http://pages.jh.edu/chem/bowen/Publication%20PDF/solvated%20electron%20clusters.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;that paper&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>

Thanks, that&#039;s much more clear <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f60a.png" alt="üòä" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

The electric potential in water is vaguely like an egg carton, with peaks near the negatively charged oxygen atoms, and troughs near and between the positively charged hydrogens

Sounds like thermalized electrons&#039; wave-functions propagate through the water like water trickling through an egg carton (on an incline).  The electron clouds move through the positively charged regions BETWEEN molecules, presumably exerting electrical tugs on all the hydrogen atoms, as they propagate through.  By a QM correspondence to Newton&#039;s laws, the hydrogen atoms tug back on the electron, slowing it down (like lowering the incline), until the electron cloud <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2601.png" alt="‚òÅ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> finally pools in one egg carton trough, in BETWEEN a few molecules (egg carton on a flat surface).

Then the water is shallowly trapped and soon solvated, but not yet recombined, and the situation looks like the Tauber picture.

What is a characteristic value of the residual energy of solvated electrons, prior to Recombination?]]></description>

I don&#039;t completely understand your first question, but solvation refers to the process of an already localized electron affecting the orientation of nearby water molecules.  When solvation is done, these water molecules are arranged in &#039;coordination shells&#039; around the electron as shown in this picture by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cchem.berkeley.edu/ramgrp/alpha/people/Alumni/mike/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Michael Tauber&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cchem.berkeley.edu/ramgrp/alpha/people/Alumni/mike/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/chemical/water_solvated_electron_tauber.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Of course everything wiggles around a lot, so this is just an &#039;typical&#039; picture of what you might see.

Solvation takes just 240 femtoseconds: about a quarter of a nanosecond!

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  Are Zundel, Eigen, and 21-water clusters the LOCALIZED sites of Solvation into Shallow Trap States?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

No, these would play a role in the much slower process of recombination: the process where the solvated electron finds a positive ion to combine with.  But I believe that pH can dramatically affect the rate of &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; process, since pH controls the density of positive ions.

I don&#039;t know how long recombination takes for water, but for liquid ammonia, which has a very high pH and thus very few positive ions, solvated electrons can last &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt; before recombining!  That&#039;s what this article says:

&#8226; H. Haberland and K. H. Bowen, &lt;a href=&quot;http://pages.jh.edu/chem/bowen/Publication%20PDF/solvated%20electron%20clusters.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Solvated electron clusters&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Springer Series in Chemical Physics&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;56&lt;/b&gt; (1994), 134&#8211;153.

By the way, this articles is full of fascinating stuff and definitely worth reading.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I understand that the overall process, is one of progressively increasing LOCALIZATION.  First, an incident, de-localized electron wave-function propagates into the matrix of water molecules.  It progressively sheds energy, until it spatially contracts INTO, and conducts THROUGH, the molecular matrix.  Thus, the electron wave-function PARTIALLY localizes into the regions NEAR positively (+) charged atomic nuclei, and shies away from inter-molecular voids, far from nuclei.

If the electron wave-function resides WITHIN the molecular matrix, then does the electron EXIT that matrix, to Solvate in an inter-molecular void, between water molecules?  Or could Solvation occur, when the electron wave-function propagates INTO a protonated water cluster?  Are Zundel, Eigen, and 21-water clusters the LOCALIZED sites of Solvation into Shallow Trap States?

If so, then perhaps pH values affect the physics?  By judiciously manipulating the concentrations of protonated (acidic) and de-protonated (alkaline) water clusters, electron penetration distances and Recombination times might be affected.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/12/30/an-electron-in-water/#comment-75490&quot;&gt;Simon Burton&lt;/a&gt;.

The article did not say, perhaps because it depends on the concentration of ions that the electron can react with.  The article is discussing electrons in a variety of liquids and even solids, not just pure water.  It should be possible to determine a time scale for recombination in pure water at room temperature... but I can&#039;t do it.

All I can do is estimate the density of positive ions in pure water.

In reality the pH of water is 7 only at 25 &#176;C.  As it gets hotter, &lt;a href=&quot;http://chemwiki.ucdavis.edu/Physical_Chemistry/Acids_and_Bases/Aqueous_Solutions/The_pH_Scale/Temperature_Dependent_of_the_pH_of_pure_Water&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the pH drops&lt;/a&gt; because the water jostles around more and there are more free H‚Å∫ ions around.  By 100 &#176;C its pH is just 6.14.

So, at 25 &#176;C there are 10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt; moles of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; per liter of water, while at 100 &#176;C there are 10&lt;sup&gt;-6.14&lt;/sup&gt; = 7.24 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt;.

The density of water also &lt;a href=&quot;http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/javascript/water-density.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;changes with temperature&lt;/a&gt;.  At 25 &#176;C it&#039;s 0.997047 kilograms per liter, while at 100 &#176;C, right before it boils, it&#039;s 0.958366.

A mole of water is 18.02 grams, so are 55.49 moles of water per kilogram. So, at 25 &#176;C there are 55.33 moles of water per liter, but at 100 &#176;C there are just 53.18.

So, at 25 &#176;C there are 10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt; moles of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; per liter of water, or 55.33 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; molecules of water for each H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion.  That&#039;s &lt;b&gt;553.3 million molecules of water for each H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion&lt;/b&gt;.

But at 100 &#176;C there are 7.24 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt; moles of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; per liter of water, or 53.18 / (7.24 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt;) molecules of water for each H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion.  That&#039;s &lt;b&gt;73.4 million molecules of water for each H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion!&lt;/b&gt;]]></description>
