					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/12/26/good-news-part-3/#comment-75150&quot;&gt;Ishi Crew&lt;/a&gt;.

I agree. There has been some &quot;magic bullet&quot; thinking at BMGF.

I&#039;d counsel against such thinking WRT insecticide treated nets (ITN). The ITN approach relies on the vector (i.e. the mosquito) feeding behaviour and will work well only when the vector feeds indoors and at night. Some vectors feed during the day and / or outside. Another key behaviour is resting behaviour which can be inside or outside. Vector species exist with different combinations of these behaviours and it is important to know which behaviours are dominant locally in order to select an effective intervention.

If you have a vector that feeds outside and rests outside then source reduction (i.e. destruction of breeding sites) is probably the better option. If the vector rest indoors then residual insecticide spraying is a good option.

This is not to attack the ITN approach but just to point out that in some settings it will not be the right thing to so. The success we see in Africa is due to the appropriateness of the ITN strategy and may not be replicable elsewhere.

Since a blood meal is necessary for reproduction we are setting up a selection pressure that may result in population behavioural changes that render the intervention less effective over time (e.g. a shift from night feeding to dusk / dawn feeding). This suggests that broader interventions such as ITNs with source reduction and case-finding with early treatment might be a better longer term option than relying solely on ITNs.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[at least the gates foundation is spending some money on really basic things like mosquito nets---i had seen some discussion of Gates foundation charity which said most anti-malarial reserarch and applications went straight to academics at U Wash seattle---conferences, search for a cure or magic bullet. also, as someone who had to spend almost 2 months in a hospital for pneumonia until i got sepsis --and i had no health insurance and the bill was 3500 dollars/day (my bill was more than i&#039;d made in the last 10 or more years) you get out , get cured, and then what---i&#039;ve lived with many african people (liberians, kenyons, ghanians, and many more off and on---nice and smart and well adjusted--many had or were getting PhDs).  but some people end up joining baka harem or whatever those various extremist groups in africa are called.one needs a life cycle analyses---this reminds me of the antiabortion people in the USA---we&#039;ll save the fetus, but then we&#039;ll send them to jail or death row.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The scariest part seems (to me) to be that some mutations in &quot;what is being spread using CRISPR&quot; would be equally well spread, but not helpful (perhaps actively harmful). Without knowing how the spreading works (I didn&#039;t read those links and probably don&#039;t have time to), it&#039;s hard to guess how correctable that would be (e.g. by spreading a corrective or replacement factor the next year).

A related question is whether whatever is spread keeps spreading indefinitely. (I would guess yes -- it just becomes a permanent part of the genome -- but I can imagine ways the answer could be no.) If it is, and if (when) it mutates in the future in any individual, can the mutated form sometimes further spread &quot;over the original&quot; (that is, win out over the original form, coming from the other parent)?]]></description>
