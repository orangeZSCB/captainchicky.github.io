					<description><![CDATA[From Wikipedia:

&quot;The world&#039;s largest palm oil biodiesel plant is the Finnish-operated Neste Oil biodiesel plant in Singapore, which opened in 2011 and produces hydrodeoxygenated NEXBTL biodiesel&quot;.

It should be pointed out that this biodiesel is then exported to the EU.

The ironies here are thick, but the is probably best summed up for &quot;be careful  what you wish for&quot;.

The EU mandates the use of biodiesel to reduce global warming. European companies go to Indonesia and fund palm oil plantations. Those plantations then cause the burning of forests which... fill in the blank and don&#039;t forget to note that the Oil refined in Singapore is of course grown in Indonesia.

I am not an expert, and I could be wrong about this, but you may be better served trying to end the use of Palm Oil as a bio-fuel in the EU.

Keep in mind that Palm Oil is a vital nutrient for billions of people who use it to get fat. Kids need lots of fat to grow healthy brains, and we need healthy brains if we are going to prosper in this century!]]></description>

Okay, thanks for the tip.  I may try &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shea_butter&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Shea butter&lt;/a&gt;.  I never knew what it actually was, but it turns out to be a fat, mainly oleic and stearic acid, made from the nuts of the African &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shea_butter&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;shea tree&lt;/a&gt;.  If people are tearing down forests in Uganda to plant shea trees that&#039;d be a bummer, but at least they aren&#039;t causing massive fires whose per-day carbon emissions exceed the whole US!

I don&#039;t want to smell like a coconut.  I&#039;ll discover what it&#039;s like to smell like a shea.]]></description>

Thanks!  Yes, Eucerin has worked well for me at times.  It seems ceresin is a wax made from a mineral named &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozokerite&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ozokerite&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylated_lanolin_alcohol&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;lanolin alcohol&lt;/a&gt; is sometimes made from the fat in sheep shearings, though sometimes from other things.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylchloroisothiazolinone&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ethylchloroisothiazolinone&lt;/a&gt; is a preservative, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylisothiazolinone&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;methylisothiazolinone&lt;/a&gt; is a preservative with somewhat scary properties.  No palms!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My understanding is that the rush to plant palm oil is the direct result of manufacturers of processed foods suddenly finding themselves needing a fat that doesn&#039;t include trans fats, but that is shelf-stable enough to sit in a vending machine for a year or two without going rancid. Apparently palm oil is an easy substitute for partially-hydrogenated vegetable oil in snack food recipes. Your Twinkie formula is saved.

I have a child with terrible atopic dermatitis in the winter months, and she likes Shea butter. You can also use coconut butter straight from the pantry, although you will have to tolerate smelling like coconut.]]></description>

How about Eucerin? The ingredients list for the tub is: Water, Petrolatum, Mineral Oil, Ceresin, Lanolin Alcohol, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone.  See http://www.eucerinus.com/product/eucerin-original-healing-soothing-repair-creme]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is terrible...

I haven&#039;t looked into it much, but Palm Oil Innovation Group (POIG) is another certification scheme for palm oil that is supposed to be stronger than RSPO, though it is built on RSPO standards and is supported by RSPO members like WWF (http://poig.org/).

I&#039;d say it is also a good idea to let companies (both retailers and manufacturers) know that you don&#039;t want them to carry products made with unsustainable palm oil, and only want them to carry products with sustainable palm oil.]]></description>

I should give that a try.  For people with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopic_dermatitis&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;atopic dermatitis&lt;/a&gt;, the best lotions seem to be extremely oily, without much alcohol (e. cetyl alcohol, cetearyl alcohol, or even worse the lighter alcohols like isopropyl alcohol).  Many lotions include alcohols to reduce the greasy feel, but it seems those alcohols just make matters worse by sucking moisture from the skin.  So says my doctor, anyway.  So something resembling butter might be ideal... as long as it doesn&#039;t go rancid.  &lt;img src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/emoticons/tongue2.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;]]></description>

Not that anyone cares, but it turns out the skin lotion I keep in my office, called Lubriderm, is made by Johnson &#038; Johnson.  it contans cetearyl alcohol and isopropyl palmitate, which are often made using palm oil.  But maybe they will switch to different ingredients, or a sustainable source for these ingredients.]]></description>
