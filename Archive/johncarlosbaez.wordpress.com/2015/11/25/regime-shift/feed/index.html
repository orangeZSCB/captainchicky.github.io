I just now (May 2019) came across this blog entry, and wanted to chime in here.

I am an ecologist. &#039;Regime shifts&#039; are &lt;strong&gt;still&lt;/strong&gt; elusive, and multiply defined.

					<description><![CDATA[G. Meehl on Tropospheric Biennial Oscillation (TBO):

&lt;i&gt;&quot;Of course, the TBO cycle depicted in Fig. 11 is not
perfectly biennial, as noted in other studies, and only
appears to operate intermittently or in a subset of years

studies have shown that these associations involving
midlatitude circulation patterns and monsoon
strength are strong enough to be evident in composites

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;&quot;I think the reason why you don’t see a damping seems to be due to their weird construction of a periodic orbit which is composed of segments of solutions to 2 “limit” differential equation systems. &quot;&lt;/i&gt;

There is nothing fundamentally &quot;weird&quot; about their formulation.  Two coupled differential equations are the basic building blocks to the second-order differential equation used to derive a wave equation. That approach is well known.  What they have added though are some non-linear terms, which serve to add some potentially chaotic elements to the mix.

I understand completely why they want to do this, because I was suckered into this trap as well.  The trap goes like this: They essentially observe that the ENSO behavior looks chaotic, so immediately assume that some sort of non-linear effect is behind it.  So they derive a non-linear perturbation to the wave equation that increases the complexity of the periodic solution.  In sloshing hydrodynamics, the first order perturbation is called the Mathieu equation, and it does work well for known liquid volume configuations (see research by Frandsen and by Faltinsen).

Yet the jury is still out as to how significant  this perturbation is to a system such as the equatorial Pacific ocean. It may be that the wave equation is modified only slightly, which is essentially describing a slight variation of the characteristic frequency over time.

If that is the case, what is causing all the complexity in ENSO?  The possible solution lies in the complicated forcing applied to the wave equation, which is caused by angular momentum shifts in the earth&#039;s rotation. That&#039;s kind of the obvious place to look.  I have been searching for research results that follow this line of path and usually end up at NASA JPL. But recently I discovered scientists in China that are looking at this as well:

Wang, W-J., W-B. Shen, and H-W. Zhang. &quot;Verifications for multiple solutions of Earth rotation.&quot; Journées Systèmes de Référence Spatio-temporels 2007. Vol. 1. 2008.

Wang, Wenjun. &quot;Free acceleration of Earth rotation and energy source of ENSO.&quot; 37th COSPAR Scientific Assembly. Vol. 37. 2008.

From the latter cite:
&lt;i&gt;&quot;Earth is a triaxial body. Triaxial body rotation has Euler dynamic model of nonlinearity with A¡B¡C. We develop a decomposition theorem for obtaining three true solutions for the rotation with two stable wobbles of Chandler and another decadal of period 14.6 a. The other may be an unstable inverted pendulum of one way sway. The nonlinear coupling of the two free wobbles provide free accelerations for the rotation or LOD with a period of 7 month and another 14.6 a. The fluctuation of period 14.6 a may cause bifurcation cascade in nonlinear coupling and a series of periods 7.3, 3.65 and 1.825 a may be observed with free accelerations and decelerations so that cause ocean water near the equator flow eastward and westward. This makes the energy source of ENSO in eigen periods of 7, 4, 2 a. Therefore in this study we verify that the energy source of ENSO is the free acceleration of Earth rotation. &quot;&lt;/i&gt;

The bottom-line is that I have been looking for numbers that match the forcing I have been using to model ENSO.  As it turns out, the numbers that Wang proposes for 3-axis Euler rotation wobble match well with what I have been using.

http://contextearth.com/2015/12/12/biennial-connection-from-qbo-to-enso/

Yesterday, I modeled a 7 month periodic forcing as Wang suggested, and sure enough, it showed up as a sharp factor centered at 0.5791 years = 6.95 months (albeit within the noise of ENSO). I am confident that Wang, Shen, Chen,et al are on to something, or that at least this effort is worth pursuing.  The JPL scientists cite this research group, which indicates to me that they are not off the deep-end in their analysis.

The point is that there are alternate views to explain the behavior of ENSO.  There are the geophysicists views  as well as the climatologists views. I am leaning towards the former.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;So where is the forcing for ENSO described? &lt;/blockquote&gt;

What I understood by briefly glancing at the paper is that the forcing is so to say &quot;hidden&quot; in the initial conditions. That is you start out with an initiial configuration of thermocline depth and temperatures (which is most probably influenced by all sorts of &quot;forcings&quot;, including lunar tides) and then you look what happens just by the fact that thermocline depth and temperatures are coupled in this way given by that sytem of differential equations. I think the reason why you don&#039;t see a damping seems to be due to their weird construction of a periodic orbit which is composed of segments of solutions to 2 &quot;limit&quot; differential equation systems. I have no idea how close these &quot;idealized&quot; segmented solutions are to solutions of the orginal system, in particular I don&#039;t know wether there are theorems about that in this what they call: &quot;Geometric Singular Perturbation Theory&quot;. Next to the ENSO data comparision it would have been interesting to see how good e.g. the solution of the z-component of that idealized assumption matches real thermocline data.]]></description>

&lt;i&gt;&quot;I think you mean that if your systems has dissipation, it’s not going to oscillate without some forcing. Is this right?&quot;&lt;/i&gt;

Certainly the dissipation is a contributing factor for the requirement of a significant forcing.

But what I actually mean is that I don&#039;t see &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; indication of any kind of forcing in that paper.  This situation really drives me nuts -- if you consider the oscillations of ocean tides, that is a phenomenon  that is entirely caused by periodic luni-solar forcing.  Nobody is going to work out a tidal analysis without consideration of the periodic orbits of the moon and the earth around the sun and how the gravitational forces impact tides.

So where is the forcing for ENSO described?   They have a left-hand side (LHS) in their differential equations but no right-hand side (RHS).

If you can see where I am coming from, now you can understand why I think I am making lots of progress on ENSO and QBO analysis. It took me a while to notice the missing forcing because it had always been implicit in the systems that I had been taught -- i.e. electrical circuits, mechanical responses, etc.  Then it slowly dawned on me that this periodic forcing  piece was totally missing in the papers that I have surveyed. Yet, the forcing is described in the research on engineering hydrology, such as sloshing on tanker vessels.  This is a hole in climate science research IMO.



But someone may have a different impression.  Perhaps it is worthy of a deeper discussion, and someone could try to dissuade me of this notion that I have :)]]></description>

That paper describes a wave equation that has significant non-linear terms. Kind of like a predator-prey or Lotka-Volterra model.  Notice that their Eq.(1) has no concept of forcing and so they are relying on the natural response to generate the complex dynamics of ENSO.

One thing I have learned in studying physics is that very few systems oscillate without a consistent forcing applied. Why does no one talk about that?  It seems as if it shouldn&#039;t be a taboo subject -- after all, the same scientists would not hesitate to suggest that the AGW signal is caused by a forcing applied to the system.]]></description>

As everyone should know by now, given the huge impact that the current ElNino is having on local climate, ENSO is the biggest factor in overall climate variability.   But ENSO itself is very curious in that many scientists believe it is nearly chaotic and therefore unpredictable. Yet, it has an internal timing which matches the QBO 28-month cycle, and one can easily extrapolate from short training intervals to regions that match rather precisely:

Another paper describes how Takens embedding theorem is used to support the idea that a stationary attractor exists in the ENSO time series.
Astudillo, H. F., R. Abarca-del-Rio, and F. A. Borotto. &quot;Long-term non-linear predictability of ENSO events over the 20th century.&quot; arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.04066 (2015).

The only region where Astudillo et al find something is amiss starts around 1981 -- which is the region that I am suggesting is the start of a transient standing wave inversion.]]></description>
