Huge amounts of work have been expended to answer this question very precisely, so that people can filter out noise and look for signals of the expected shape in data from LIGO and other gravitational wave detectors.  In 1997, the National Science Foundation gave a &lt;a href=&quot;http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1997ASPC..123..305C&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&quot;Grand Challenge&quot; grant&lt;/a&gt; to a big team of researchers to numerically simulate black hole collisions and the gravitational waves these would create.  It turned out to be a lot harder than they&#039;d expected!  For a while people were worried that we&#039;d be getting data but not know how to analyze it.  Now, however, people are succeeding.

Instead of showing you what the signal &lt;em&gt;looks&lt;/em&gt; like, I&#039;ll suggest that you &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.mit.edu/sahughes/www/Sounds/iota_20_0.998_h.wav&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;listen to it&lt;/a&gt;.  This sound file illustrates the gravitational radiation produced a 10 solar mass black hole spiraling into a rapidly spinning million solar mass black hole.  It&#039;s sped up by about a factor of 1000 from reality.  It&#039;s quite dramatic near the end!

You can hear other variants here, and read about them:

					<description><![CDATA[We mortals must stand if awe of experimental physicists and what they can do.

If a nice light, empy 747 flies over head at its crusing altitude of 40000 feet it produces a contrary force of about 1 part per trillion of that (1e-13 Newtons, If I did my maths right). In fact, if a nice light fella of 50 kg happens to be flying around in orbit 10000 kilometers overhead (I hope you are okay person. the view must be amazing), I gather they will produce a force 3 times greater than 1e-28.

Do you know what the signal is expected to look like? Is it a sine wave, or a square wave? Do you know the frequency? Or is it more of a pulse.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks John (also to the pointer to your vast archives). I didn’t know about hypernova/GRB connection. I wonder if observers can tell which burning mode a given star is in, and if so whether the modes are seen in anything like the expected ratios given their durations and other parameters.  Maybe most are too rare to be amenable to such statistical tests.

Speaking of rare, your mention of GRB030329 reminded me of GRB080319B, which packs considerable human interest for something so remote and boringly-named.

I knew already that it was, for 30 seconds in 2008, the most distant (light travel time ~7.5B years) naked eye observable object ever detected.  I now see that it was &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; the intrinsically brightest object ever detected, that this is due to its narrow (0.4 degrees) inner jet pointing our way, that its peak brightness occurred within hours of Arthur C. Clarke’s death, and that the ‘B’ in its name indicates that it was the second of an unprecedented &lt;em&gt;five&lt;/em&gt; GRBs observed that day.  Our wakes should all be that well-planned:-)]]></description>

Yes, a supernova is an utterly amazing event.  But a hypernova is even more amazing.  From &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week204.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Week 204&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;i&gt;This Week&#039;s Finds&lt;/i&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  The life of a star is largely determined by its mass. Small stars last a long time and fade away inconspicuously, while big stars live fast and die with a bang. Wolf-Rayet stars are among the biggest, about 60 times as heavy as the Sun. Like the sun, they begin life as cloud of gas that collapses and heats up until the hydrogen in its core &quot;catches fire&quot; and starts fusing into helium, like a gigantic H-bomb held together by its own gravity. The core is surrounded by a envelope of cooler gas that transmits energy to the surface by convection and radiation, but doesn&#039;t actually do any fusion itself.
  
  This stage of a star&#039;s life is called the &quot;core burning phase&quot;. But after a while helium builds up and sinks to the center, forming an inert helium core, with all the fusion going on in the layer of hydrogen right next to the core. This is called the &quot;shell burning phase&quot;.
  
  What next? Well, for the Sun, as its hydrogen gradually runs out it&#039;ll become a &quot;red giant&quot;, expanding to engulf the Earth... while meanwhile its helium core shrinks to a ball twice the size of the Earth and about 100 times the density of water, turning from ordinary plasma into something called a &quot;degenerate electron gas&quot;, where the Pauli exclusion principle limits further compression. As the core shrinks it&#039;ll heat up, and when it reaches a temperature of 100 million kelvin the helium will catch fire and start fusing - mainly into carbon. Models predict that this happens in a runaway reaction called the &quot;helium flash&quot;, which puts out about 100 billion times the power of the present-day sun for a few hours - zounds! - but gradually settles down into a more stable phase of helium burning that lasts for tens of millions of years. During this phase, the Sun will not be a red giant anymore, but instead a hotter &quot;yellow giant&quot;.
  
  The Sun will never get hot enough to burn elements heavier than helium, so eventually it&#039;ll develop an inert core of carbon and other junk, surrounded by a helium burning shell, surrounded by a hydrogen burning shell. Then the outer layers will peel off and expand to form a huge nebula, leaving the core as a tiny &quot;white dwarf&quot;... which will cool, after eons, to a &quot;black dwarf&quot;.
  
  Bigger stars do more exciting things. In particular, stars heavier than about 5 solar masses undergo a &quot;carbon flash&quot; when the carbon-rich core reaches 600 million kelvin and starts fusing into heavier elements. Heavier stars then go on to an oxygen-burning phase. Even heavier ones go on to a silicon-burning phase.
  
  But when silicon fuses, it forms highly stable nuclei like iron that don&#039;t want to fuse any further. So, silicon burning is the end of the line. And it doesn&#039;t last long! For example, a star 25 times the mass of the Sun is expected to spend about 5 to 10 million years burning hydrogen, 0.5 to 1 million years burning helium, 500 to 1000 years burning carbon, 6 to 12 months burning oxygen... but just a day or so burning silicon!
  
  Then what? Well, the details depend on the star&#039;s mass. But when a star of at least 8 solar masses runs out of fuel, its core is made mainly of iron, and heavier than our Sun. When it cools, it reaches a point where all of a sudden it collapses - in about a tenth of a second. When it crashes in on itself, it gets so hot that the iron nuclei disintegrate and the whole mess explodes in a &quot;type II supernova&quot;. The star&#039;s outer layers get thrown off at high speeds, while the core itself gets crushed into a neutron star... or, for truly heavy stars, a black hole!
  
  Type II supernovae are among the most violent events in the cosmos. They can easily reach a temperature of about 50 billion kelvin and emit 10&lt;sup&gt;46&lt;/sup&gt; joules of energy, which is what our galaxy puts out in 10 years! 99% of this energy is in the form of neutrinos, emitted when protons in the iron core absorb electrons and turn into neutrons. But, the remaining 1% in the form of electromagnetic radiation is still enough to fry anything in the vicinity. The supernova in the Crab Nebula was about 6,300 light years away, but when its light reached us in 1054 AD, Chinese astronomers could see it in the daytime for 23 days!
  
  You may think I&#039;ve forgotten about GRB030329 and Wolf-Rayet stars, but I haven&#039;t. This big digression was just to set the stage. I&#039;ve sketched what stars of up to 25 solar masses will do, but remember, Wolf-Rayets are a lot bigger: they begin life at about 60 solar masses. And astronomy resembles opera in this way: the bigger the star, the more noise they make in their final scene. So, the stuff about supernovae was just to whet your appetite.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[“One expert told the New York Times that the energy of this explosion will equal 100 million supernovae.”

This makes supernovae seem positively piddling by comparison – and they are, but &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; by comparison.  They are decidedly &lt;em&gt;non&lt;/em&gt;-piddling with respect to normal human scales.  Those who, like me, may need convincing on this point, should read the answer to the below question, taken from &lt;a href=&quot;http://what-if.xkcd.com/73/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this very entertaining xkcd What’s Next:&lt;/a&gt;

“Which of the following would be brighter, in terms of the amount of energy delivered to your retina:

According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKS_1302-102&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  The two supermassive black holes are merging, and are 180 billion miles (2.9×10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; km) apart, comparable to the separation between the Sun and the Oort Cloud in our Solar System.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That&#039;s about 1900 AU.   I&#039;ll let someone else figure out what&#039;s causing the discrepancy here.   The orbital period is directly observed and it&#039;s probably correct within 50% or better.  The distance can only be estimated, since we don&#039;t know the angle of view (one black hole could be almost in front of the other).  The masses and velocities are probably just guessed/inferred from the other data.]]></description>

<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKS_1302-102" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

A black hole merger emits mostly gravitational radiation, and it&#039;s an interesting puzzle to figure out how destructive---or not---this radiation will be when the two black holes in  PG 1302-102 collide and emit 10&lt;sup&gt;52&lt;/sup&gt; joules of gravitational radiation: 100 million supernovae&#039;s worth of energy.

The jets emitted by the accretion disk of these black holes may go crazy as well during the collision: as the black holes spiral in, more matter may fall in as well.  This could by itself be quite dramatic, even though the total energy involved is much less.

As for your last question, I mentioned that it seems one expert estimates that the merger of these black holes will turn approximately 0.01% of their combined mass into energy.  In the long run, Hawking radiation turns &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the mass into energy---but that&#039;s an insanely slow process.]]></description>

I can&#039;t quite answer either of your questions, but here&#039;s what comes to mind:

1) A strange thing about the concept of event horizon is that the location or even existence of an event horizon &#039;now&#039; can depend on our actions &#039;in the future&#039;.   I&#039;m putting in quotes because the concepts of &#039;now&#039; and &#039;future&#039; are tricky in general relativity.  But that&#039;s not really the problem here.  The event horizon is defined to be the imaginary surface such that light emitted within this surface can never get out to infinity in the future.  So, if we were able to drag black holes around or create them by compressing matter, the location of the event horizon now might depend on what we do in the future.

However, what we do might have just a tiny effect.

2) Regarding procrastination: there&#039;s a sense in which we&#039;ve &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; started procrastinating in our response to the Milky Way&#039;s collision with Andromeda.  We feel sure it&#039;s going to happen, yet we&#039;re not doing anything about it---not even planning.]]></description>
