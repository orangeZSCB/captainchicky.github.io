Hi!  I don&#039;t think you need to log into that website.  That&#039;s for conference participants to post their talks, and for me to post the schedule.  You&#039;ll be able to watch the workshop live as described above (if I understand correctly), you can also watch videos of the talks later, and you can leaves comments here.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[John, can you or someone from NIMBioS provision me to log into the site at http://www.nimbios.org/wordpress-training/entropy/ as I watch/listen from afar?  I wish I could have been there this week with everyone. Thanks for putting it together and good luck this week!

For those on twitter, remember that the hashtag for the workhop is #entropyWS.]]></description>
