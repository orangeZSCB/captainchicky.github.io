					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s a semi-intuitive example---i studied some chemistry and i&#039;ve also built (actually repaired) a table (damaged in a domestic dispute--someone threw the table at someone else.).

I see they started to include the &#039;work&#039; or &#039;labor&#039; part in that --some nails and wood put next to each other won&#039;t make a table in my experience. You need a worker--and then  more resources--in general, workers have to eat and breath and even take a break from construction.

I see the author works at PI. I submitted an essay to FQXI associated with PI for a contest last year--it was rejected becuase it was improperly formatted and my references were not written in  the standard form. Big names--Rovelli and G Ellis basically won that contest--got the $ or resources.

Smolin at PI among others also studies resource economics a bit---via guage  theory.

I mostly study resource allocation from perspective of ecology and the economics of daily life. An ecosystem is similar to making a pie or table. You need some fish, snakes, deers, turkeys, foxes, coyotes, bears, frogs, trees etc and also some air and water and weather. The question is how many do you need and what is the optimal &#039;ratios&#039;. You can write that as kind of Cobbs-Douglas function from economics (or even a form of Ehrlich&#039;s I=PAT).

Daily life is also a resource allocation problem. How do you spend your time or any money you have? Where do you fit in, in the &#039;social ecosystem&#039;? Some people don&#039;t fit in anywhere--its like making a puzzle from pieces (or  maybe one of those Penrose/Wang tilings to cover the plane noncomputably)  --some puzzle pieces or tiles or people you just have to throw away.Ramanujan lasted 31 years before he was thrown away.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We are lucky to have Tobias in our course, helping the discussions along!  He&#039;s already posted some articles on resource theory here on this blog.  We&#039;re having fun bouncing between the relatively abstract world of monoidal preorders and their very concrete real-world applications to chemistry, scheduling, manufacturing and other topics.

					<description><![CDATA[Hugo Nava-Kopp and I have a new paper on resource theories:

&#8226; Brendan Fong and Hugo Nava-Kopp, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.02651&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Additive monotones for resource theories of parallel-combinable processes with discarding&lt;/a&gt;.

A mathematical theory of resources is Tobias Fritz&#039;s current big project. He&#039;s already explained how ordered monoids can be viewed as theories of resource convertibility in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/04/07/resource-convertibility-part-1/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;three part series&lt;/a&gt; on this blog.

Ordered monoids are great, and quite familiar in network theory: for example, a Petri net can be viewed as a presentation for an ordered commutative monoid. But this work started in symmetric monoidal categories, together with my (Oxford) supervisor Bob Coecke and Rob Spekkens.]]></description>

One can illustrate what John said with the example of building a table:

$latex 20\cdot\text{planks} + 10\cdot\text{nails}\geq \text{table}.$

How would you model this is linear logic? What&#039;s the operational meaning of all the quantifiers, including negation? (I&#039;m relatively ignorant of linear logic, so this is a genuine question.)

See also Section 10.1 of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://perimeterinstitute.ca/personal/tfritz/ordered_commutative_monoids.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;. If my comparison to linear logic seems too naive, I&#039;d be glad to know.]]></description>
