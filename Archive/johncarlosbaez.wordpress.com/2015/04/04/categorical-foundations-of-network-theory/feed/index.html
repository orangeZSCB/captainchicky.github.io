					<description><![CDATA[Someone asked me what the workshop achieved.  I replied:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
First, we figured out a lot about how the approach Brendan Fong and I are using to describe networks (&quot;decorated cospans&quot;) is related to the approach David Spivak uses (&quot;the operad of wiring diagrams&quot;).  David and a student and Brendan will try to prove some theorems about this and write this up.

Second, Eugene Lerman and I made some progress understanding each other&#039;s thoughts on networks of nonlinear classical mechanical systems.  There&#039;s a short paper I should write on this, but I&#039;m being distracted...

... by my new work with Brendan and Blake Pollard on networks in stochastic thermodynamics!  This seems more urgent to me, since I believe it will help us understand living systems.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

The two are different, but closely related.

I&#039;ll talk about their relation at the Turin workshop in May.  For now, let me just talk about this paper with Brendan.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This May, a small group of mathematicians is going to a workshop on the categorical foundations of network theory, or Jacob Biamonte. I’m trying to get us mentally prepared for this. We all have different ideas, yet they should fit together somehow.

Tobias Fritz, Eugene Lerman and David Spivak have all written articles here about their work, though I suspect Eugene will have a lot of completely new things to say, too. Now it’s time for me to say what my students and I have doing.]]></description>

The category of manifolds in general and symplectic manifolds in particular don&#039;t have pullbacks.  Do you want to look at derived pullbacks?]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  I think electrical engineers are more used to ‘composing’ two systems, by identifying some variables of one system with those of the other. In composition, you create a new phase space that’s a pushout of two other phase spaces. For example, this is what happens when you attach two electrical circuits by connecting some wires from one to wires from another: you identify some currents and potentials in the first circuit with some currents and potentials in the second.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I should have said &quot;pullback&quot;, not &quot;pushout&quot;.  We&#039;re taking a product of two phase spaces and then taking an &quot;equalizer&quot; where we demand that some functions on the first equal some functions on the other---for example, some currents and voltages in one circuit equal currents and voltages in another.  Doing a product and then an equalizer in this way is doing a pullback.

I slipped because I often think of electrical circuits as graphs with extra structure, and to compose &lt;em&gt;these&lt;/em&gt; we do a pushout.  But the functor from graphs to phase spaces is contravariant, and it carries pushouts to pullbacks.

  I don’t disagree with you. And it looks like you don’t disagree with me either — there is no theory of networks of Hamiltonian systems yet and it’s not clear how to start building it.

I&#039;m afraid disagreement isn&#039;t a symmetric relation.  Well, okay: it&#039;s not exactly &quot;clear&quot; how to build the theory of networks of Hamiltonian systems---but it doesn&#039;t seem hard, either.]]></description>

At some point a year or two ago I toyed with the idea of coupling mechanical systems by using (generalized) forces.  The geometry of such a set up looked like a fun thing to play with.  Unfortunately I didn&#039;t (and don&#039;t) have enough physical examples to check if this exercise was going to be on the right track; if it it was going to make physical sense.]]></description>
