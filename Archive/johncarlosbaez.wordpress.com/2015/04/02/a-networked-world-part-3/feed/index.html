					<description><![CDATA[Last time we talked about understanding types of networks as categories of decorated cospans. Earlier, David Spivak told us about understanding networks as algebras of an operad. Both these frameworks work at capturing notions of modularity and interconnection. Are they then related? How?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/04/02/a-networked-world-part-3/#comment-65491&quot;&gt;Martin Gisser&lt;/a&gt;.

When I helped run the Dagstuhl workshop &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=14182&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Categorical methods at the crossroads&lt;/a&gt; last spring, we invited Andr&#233;e Ehresmann to speak about this work.  I later spent time talking to her in Paris, where she&#039;s working with some music theorists at IRCAM.  I even blogged about her on Google+:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-8N038tctXks/U379hgAbNuI/AAAAAAAAt1U/y1ZUHBAVb54/w318-h403-no/andree_ehresmann_IRCAM.jpg&quot; /&gt;
 
This is the category theorist Andrée Ehresmann in an anechoic chamber, computer in hand.  Yesterday we went into this room at IRCAM, a famous experimental music laboratory in Paris. 

An anechoic chamber is a room with walls designed to absorb all incident sounds - if you snap your fingers, it sounds strangely dead, and one of my hosts said you can lose your sense of orientation.  At IRCAM they sometimes suspend a piano inside the anechoic chamber to study its sounds without any echoes getting in the way.

IRCAM is the Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique/Musique.  From the outside it looks unimpressive, because most of the rooms are underground.  Inside they&#039;ve got a huge performance space where all the walls are speakers... using computers they can make sounds move around the room.  And I got a great demonstration of OMax, a program that can listen to musicians, learn the patterns, and start to improvise along with them in real time. 

Andrée Ehresmann is a mathematician who began as analyst but then worked on category theory with her husband Charles, developing concepts such as double categories, internal categories and the like, often for the study of differential geometry.  At IRCAM she is working on music theory with Alexandre Popoff and Moreno Andreatta. 

They&#039;re studying &lt;b&gt;K-nets&lt;/b&gt;, which are diagrams where the vertices are notes or chords, and the edges are musical operations like transposition (raising or lowering a note or chord) and inversion (flipping a note or chord upside down).  K-nets were invented by a music theorist:

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klumpenhouwer_network&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Klumpenhouwer network&lt;/a&gt;, Wikipedia.

but they&#039;re easiest to define using some category theory.  You start with a group G of musical operations (like the 24-element group of transpositions and inversions), think of it acting on a set S (like a set of notes or chords), and then look at a functor from a diagram D into G.  Then the vertices of the diagram get labelled with notes or chords in S, while the edges get labelled with musical operations in G.

I had a great time, and hope to spend more time there someday when I return to Paris!   Alas, I&#039;m leaving the day after tomorrow.﻿
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But I digress!  I think I &lt;em&gt;roughly&lt;/em&gt; understand her approach of describing emergence by starting with a category and building up a new category where objects are diagrams of a specified type in the original category... and repeating this process.

To the limited extent that I understand her work, I sympathize with it.  I am very happy to see one of the pioneers of category theory continuing to break new ground in an ambitious way.  But as far as I can tell, I think the material in this book needs to be supplemented by many other ideas to really capture the details of complex phenomena.  Some of these other ideas will be very general, while others will be specific to a particular problem or class of problems.

Coming from a mathematical physics background, I&#039;m happiest when I see things applied to examples.  If I don&#039;t see all the details of how my general formalisms handle specific examples, I feel like I&#039;m floating in clouds. That&#039;s why a lot of my work on networks so far has dealt with specific well-known kinds of neworks: chemical reaction networks, electrical circuits, bond graphs and signal flow diagrams.  I&#039;m trying to draw general lessons about symmetric monoidal bicategories and the like, but my formalisms also incorporate ideas like Kirchoff&#039;s laws, equilibrium for chemical reactions, and so on.]]></description>

That was my most expensive category theory book too. I think it&#039;s interesting stuff, but I didn&#039;t get a sense of where exactly it leads.

What I&#039;m realizing is that people in science aren&#039;t going to think much about category theory until it solves something, rather than just gives a language. In math, we find it not just to be a nice language; we&#039;re able to use that language (and whatever else CT is) to prove new theorems. Theorems are our currency, so it works for us.

I think what scientists want to see is new results, new testable predictions, which are eventually validated. I don&#039;t follow too closely, but I&#039;m not sure Memory Evolutive Systems ever got to this next step. Indeed, it&#039;s pretty hard to do so; I would like to get much further than I have in that respect.]]></description>

Sure, I&#039;ll fix it.  By the way, if anyone wants to use LaTeX in comments here, just read the directions that appear right above the box where you type your comment.  That makes the difference between $A$ and $latex A$.]]></description>

Yes, they recently invited me to this workshop:

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~yoav/kinnet/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Kinetic networks: from topology to design&lt;/a&gt;, 17-19 September 2014, Santa Fe Institute.  Organized by  Yoav Kallus, Pablo Damasceno, and Sidney Redner.

Unfortunately I can&#039;t go, because I&#039;m coming back from Singapore to California on the 18th.

This is just one of many interesting things people are doing at the Santa Fe Institute.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  If you really are bucking for Hari Seldon’s job (as appears to be the case), once you get this all sorted out you will need to translate it into natural language for the rest of us:-)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I hope David Spivak isn&#039;t trying to &#039;predict the history of the galaxy&#039; like Hari Seldon did.   And I think getting network theory sorted out will take quite a while---enough time for you to learn category theory and operads.  &lt;img src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/emoticons/biggrin.gif&quot;/&gt;]]></description>

Oops, that was a typo. I think I meant to leave the $A$ off here, and just say something like,

&#039;In this way, any &quot;2-fold loop space&quot; gives an algebra of May&#039;s little 2-cubes operad.&#039;

John, would it be possible to fix that?]]></description>
