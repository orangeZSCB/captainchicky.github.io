Yes, I think that&#039;s about right. If anything, I would hope that ordered commutative monoids can help us to make the difference in starting assumptions more explicit, which may help us to figure out which starting assumptions are realistic and which ones ignore aspects that are relevant to the problem.

(And just to be clear: the theory of ordered commutative monoids is not descriptive! In other words, it is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a theory of what happens in the economy. Rather, it is a theory of what &lt;em&gt;can be made to happen&lt;/em&gt; in principle, which allows for informed decision-making.)]]></description>

Whoops, I only see this comment now -- I&#039;m sorry to not have replied earlier! I&#039;ve been a bit distracted by our &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/04/06/information-and-entropy-in-biological-systems-part-3/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;entropy workshop&lt;/a&gt;.

Your thoughts are extremely interesting to me. Using the toolbox of ordered commutative monoids in economics is an eventual goal that I have. But there&#039;s a long way to go! For now, I can say a bit about how this project relates to behavioral vs &#039;rational agent&#039; economics. I think there are mainly two ways of applying resource-theoretic ideas economically:

1) As an entire society, we can try to study how much &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellbeing&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;well-being&lt;/a&gt; we can extract from our resources, or conversely how much of our natural resources we need to consume in order to generate a given amount of well-being. The toolbox of theorems that I am developing should apply to this type of question. The theory does not say anything about how the optimum is to be achieved; it might be possible to do so using a market-based economy, or it might require a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_economy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;planned economy&lt;/a&gt;.

2) An individual agent, such as a person or a company, can be concerned with &lt;em&gt;their own&lt;/em&gt; resources and how much of them they need in order to achieve certain goals. Resource-theoretic ideas apply here as well; in fact, they are already being applied whenever one uses &lt;a href=&quot;www.mhhe.com/engcs/industrial/hillier/etext/PDF/chap03.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;linear programming to study resource allocation&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to classify this according to rational-agent vs behavioral economics, it will belong to the former. In particular, my &lt;a href=&quot;http://perimeterinstitute.ca/personal/tfritz/ordered_commutative_monoids.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; also discusses the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Morgenstern_utility_theorem&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;utility theorem&lt;/a&gt;, which is the basis of the theory of rational agents.

So, I&#039;m afraid that what I&#039;m doing will not help behavioral economics in any immediate way. But in an ideal world, it would help us achieve the transition to sustainability.

Your links A-D are very interesting! I need to find time to study them in detail and might get back to you here with further comments or questions.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[TPTB want to hear what they want to hear and nothing else. their preference for &#039;mathematical&#039; economists over &#039;social&#039; economists is all about conclusions, not methods.
The difference in conclusions is largely a result of the starting assumptions, which in the case of &#039;mathematical&#039; (neo-classical) economists are chosen in order to give results agreeable to TPTB.
So both kinds of economists will use these monoids to reach the conclusions they want to reach.
eg.
$latex \text{timber + nails + saw + hammer} \geq \text{table + saw + hammer}$
or
$latex \text{timber + nails + saw + hammer + space + time + energy + skill} \geq \text{table + saw + hammer + space + skill + waste}$]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Tobias,

You wrote: &quot;In economic terms, we can think of a functional as a consistent assignment of prices to all resource objects.&quot; I&#039;m pretty sure you don&#039;t mean to, but I think you are getting close to politics. For an overview, A (below) links to a Nova video that you might like. Or dislike. But I&#039;m guessing the former.

According to the video, mathematical economists have so far ruled the roost in determining policy. But now behavioral economists have more success in explaining the economy. Some mathematical economists don&#039;t like this. One is even quoted as saying that he stopped his subscription to The Economist because it reports findings in behavioral economics.

Question:

Who would be more inclined to apply your resource theory as it stands right now-- mathematical economists or behavioral economists?

Behavioral economics is based on social science. There is now in D.C. a struggle between belief systems and science, to the extent that defunding social science is once again on the political agenda. See B, which links to a proposal to Congress that all social science be defunded.

In the paper linked to C, social science has in the past changed its mind about racism. After the change, an agenda to defund social science is evident. For example about twenty years ago, when I was working as an industrial researcher, I overheard the topic of defunding all social science discussed at a table at a restaurant in D.C.

Today there is an urgent need for policy to address the resources of food and water. Think of California.

From pollution, water changes from a resource for life into a non-potable resource for things like cooling systems.

From inefficient use, food changes from a resource for humans into a resource for other forms of life. And about a third of each year&#039;s production is wasted. (D)

So when this amount of food is being wasted, is the cause of people starving to death on the planet a more fitting subject for mathematical economics or behavioral economics? Which field is probably better for studying greed?

I do hope behavioral economists become interested in applying your work. They might be able to use your theorems in their political struggle against the mathematical economists.
