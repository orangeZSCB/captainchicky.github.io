					<description><![CDATA[In this paper, we study the props for various kinds of electrical circuits:

&#8226; John Baez, Brandon Coya and Franciscus Rebro, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08321&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Props in network theory&lt;/a&gt;.

[...]

In Section 6 we introduce the prop $latex \mathrm{FinRel}_k.$  This prop is equivalent to the symmetric monoidal category with finite-dimensional vector spaces over the field $latex k$ as objects and linear relations as morphisms, with &lt;i&gt;direct sum&lt;/i&gt; as its tensor product.  A presentation of this prop was given in these papers:

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/04/23/categories-in-control-2/#comment-66443&quot;&gt;Jason Erbele&lt;/a&gt;.

Sounds interesting!  I&#039;ll have to read this book.

By the way, I don&#039;t use &#039;categorified&#039; the way you just did, meaning &#039;study using categories&#039;.  I consider categorification to be semi-systematic process of boosting mathematical structures up the ladder of n-categories.  For example, we can take the fact that addition of natural numbers is commutative and associative, and categorify it to obtain the fact that $latex \mathrm{FinSet}$ is a symmetric monoidal category under $latex +$.

When I say categorification is &#039;semi-systematic&#039;, what I mean is this. The actual systematic process is &#039;decategorification&#039;, where we take a category and convert it into a set, namely its set of isomorphism classes of objects.  A functor between categories gives a function between their decategorifications.  For example, the coproduct

$latex + : \mathrm{FinSet} \times \mathrm{FinSet} \to \mathrm{FinSet}$

gives the function

$latex + : \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$

Categorification is the attempt to reverse this systematic process: to take structures in set-based mathematics and see them as decategorifications of structures in category-based mathematics.

Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately) you came to UCR a few years after I was really interested in categorification.  But as my grad student I expect you to spread the word!  The beginning of this paper is supposed to be fun:

&#8226; John Baez and James Dolan, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/math/9802029&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Categorification&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>

Skimming through chapter 7 (the chapter on category theory), Pearson gives many examples of categories describing a great number of things, where the control systems are morphisms.  I did not find him using &lt;i&gt;monoidal&lt;/i&gt; categories, so there should be great potential just in recasting his examples in the light of symmetric monoidal categories.  I like what he has to say in the chapter summary, after the recap of the various topics that he categorified:

&quot;Given the general difficulty of analyzing the qualitative behavior of nonlinear dynamic models, any analytical tool this flexible would seem to merit further examination.&quot;]]></description>

That book sounds like something I should read, too.  It seems to be available online through the UCR library, and apparently downloadable for 14 days.

I wonder if it has an auto-destruct sequence when you download it that causes smoke to come out of your computer or tablet when it reaches the end the fortnight, like the tapes in Mission Impossible...]]></description>

<p>That book sounds like something I should read, too.  It seems to be available online through the UCR library, and apparently downloadable for 14 days.</p>
<p>I wonder if it has an auto-destruct sequence when you download it that causes smoke to come out of your computer or tablet when it reaches the end the fortnight, like the tapes in Mission Impossible&#8230;</p>

I don&#039;t know about Pearson or this book!  I should read it!  Thanks.

We&#039;re big on categories where the control systems are &lt;em&gt;morphisms&lt;/em&gt; in a symmetric monoidal category, so that you can compose and tensor them.  I&#039;d be simultaneously excited and depressed if Pearson had already done this.]]></description>
