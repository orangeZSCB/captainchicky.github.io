nad said: &quot;it may be more &quot;fit&quot; for that organism to stop growing&quot;... 

yes, and this can apply even more to an expanding cilivization, if it&#039;s intelligently controlled (governed) and *imagines* that it&#039;s part of a larger system containing perhaps yet-more-powerful civilizations. (Or in a finite place whose resources would run out if it didn&#039;t stop growing.)

For the universe setting (as opposed to Earth), the slowness of communication makes that intelligent governance much harder -- it pretty much has to be agreed on, with a perfectly reliable but not overly restrictive enforcement mechanism already running, before the expansion gets underway at all.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/02/14/earth-like-planets-near-red-dwarfs/#comment-64139&quot;&gt;Bruce Smith&lt;/a&gt;.

arch1 asked (I&#039;m paraphrasing): &quot;doesn&#039;t your argument imply that expansion start-points (SPs) are extremely rare (say, &#060;1 per visible-universe volume)?&#034;

It&#039;s important to think of that volume as in spacetime, not space, since as you get farther away you see the results of less and less time since the universe&#039;s beginning, and since the rate of start-point creation per unit volume might be lower for earlier ages.

But given that -- yes, that&#039;s the main point. The puzzle is &#034;why don&#039;t we see them&#034;; the argument includes &#034;if they were there (in our past-cone), they&#039;d probably have overrun us by now (unless they&#039;re hiding)&#034;; and one conclusion is that a plausible explanation for our not seeing them is simply that they&#039;re rare enough that we shouldn&#039;t expect to, so far. (That&#039;s not a mystery in itself, since we have no evidence whatsoever, practical or theoretical, that such start-points are not rarer than any specific density.)

I guess that&#039;s a simpler way of saying it than I actually said. What I said looked at the ratio of spacetime volumes in which we observe they didn&#039;t start and then overrun us, vs. in which we observe they didn&#039;t start and then become visible to us. But your (and Graham&#039;s) way of putting the argument is simpler and ultimately equivalent.]]></description>

I don&#039;t think the author meant to refer to a song in the second part of that sentence. If he or she had written, &quot;..., the old song is right: &#039;Suicide is painless&#039;.  As well as a blessing to one&#039;s neighbors,&quot; it might have been clearer.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;Re the song “Suicide is Painless”: it’s not exactly by the Manic Street Preachers. I know it as the theme song to the old series M.A.S.H. from the 1970’s, which is probably the way most people came to learn of the song.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I am sorry. I somehow got the impression that Jonny Mandel and Mike Altman were part of the Manic Street Preachers, which if I understood you correctly is/was not the case.

Anyways the second part of Traci Watson&#039;s sentence:

&lt;blockquote&gt;as well as a blessing to one’s neighbors. &lt;/blockquote&gt; 

may indicate that he or she was having another &quot;suicide is painless&quot;-song in mind which is neither by Jonny Mandel, Mike Altman or the Manic Street Preachers and it would be interesting to know what kind of song this is and who wrote that song.]]></description>

Interesting research as it seems. Maybe I oversaw something but your &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.sciencemag.org/2013/03/scienceshot-why-bacteria-commit-suicide&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;science mag article seems to have no link to the original article.&lt;/a&gt; So in particular I couldn&#039;t understand how the researchers proved that it was suicide and not &quot;murder&quot;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;So for these microbes, at least, the old song is right: Suicide is painless, as well as a blessing to one’s neighbors. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Never heard that strange song before. Is this a british folk song? Who sang that song? 
In particular the sentence is not in the 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.metrolyrics.com/theme-from-mash-suicide-is-painless-lyrics-manic-street-preachers.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;lyrics&lt;/a&gt; of that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00oB60DqnjY&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;song by the Manic Street Preachers.&lt;/a&gt;

By the way - a lot if not most suicides are not painless.]]></description>

I don&#039;t find my predictions depressing, perhaps because I am used to them. Or maybe I&#039;m a short-termist. After the first billion years it all seems a bit unreal to me. And can life ever rival black holes as a destroyer of resources? Perhaps it should try!

I think that, more likely than not, there is nothing out there in the whole Virgo Supercluster that you could have a conversation with right now. And that seems very sad and lonely, as well as a terrible waste of starlight (or stars). I prefer to imagine it colonised, even by organisms which are &quot;overpaid, overfed, oversexed and over here&quot;. I do not think that evolution simply selects for profligacy, its more complex than that. Better to say it selects for a very wide range of frugal to profligate lifestyles. I think there&#039;ll be lots of niches for those who want a quiet life. But a mixture of frugal and profligate looks profligate overall, and that&#039;s what we&#039;ll see first.]]></description>

The human body is not a pristine environment, whereas as space mostly is. But yes, things can get very complicated when different species interact: Eg:
