					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;They say this event didn’t affect the comets very much. But if it shook some comets loose from the Oort cloud, they would take about 2 million years to get here! So, they won’t arrive for a long time.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
They might say that, but we have no idea how many close encounters the Oort cloud suffered during the last couple of million years. Even Scholtz&#039;s star was barely detectable, older events have only left traces in the Oort cloud itself.

The anthropic principle only guarantees there was no terminator event in our past, for the future it says nothing. The universe is a dangerous place indeed.

We obviously need a fleet of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Orion_(nuclear_propulsion)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Orion class&lt;/a&gt; spacehips patrolling the outer solar system, along with an ongoing all sky survey performed by large space based telescopes, sensitive in the far infrared.

Near-Earth objects are much easier to deal with, provided we have the equipment to detect them. In that case we may have several decades to divert their orbit slightly, should any of them be on a collision course with Earth. That can be done by conventional spacecrafts and we have plenty of time to plan such a mission.

It is not so with deep space objects, heading into the inner solar system from the Oort cloud. If such a swarm was initiated by some ancient fly-by and sizable objects are actually targeting Earth, there is no early warning whatsoever. If we are not prepared, we are doomed.

If time is short, you need large acceleration for an extended period to meet the incoming object, then tugging on it gently at a small relative speed to divert it. Even if you have the spacecraft ready, only nuclear propulsion can deliver such a performance.]]></description>

Hmm, the prevalence of these stars may mean it&#039;s tough to travel at relativistic speeds in intergalactic space!  It seems there&#039;s more junk out there than I thought.]]></description>

I&#039;m not completely sure where the heat is coming from in Jupiter: gravitational contraction, or maybe chemical reactions?  I&#039;m sure people have theories!

I&#039;m curious about whether life could form in cloud droplets, assuming they were warm enough and had enough organic chemicals, with lightning to get things started.  I&#039;m not sure it can work!  But of course I hope it can, because then we might have life on Jupiter-like planets and also Y-dwarfs.  There are lots of these.

I also don&#039;t know how complex the organic molecules observed in Jupiter&#039;s clouds are.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It is interesting, a planet with the core of a star.
There are models for the starting of the life, one hypothesize the hydrothermal vent like a source of life.
In a very cold Y-dwarf, if I understand well, there is a core that give enough energy to heat the surface, so I am thinking that must happen something similar to Jupiter: a constant mixing of colored cloud (observed chromophores), with a composition similar to that of the hydrothermal vents, and a possible mechanism for generating elementary life.]]></description>
