					<description><![CDATA[Thermoregulate with grace: butterfly wing scale structure

“As we as architects begin to think about designing not an object, but a process inspired by nature to generate objects, in short we will have no constraints. With the processes in our hands that allow us to create structures that we couldn’t even have dreamt of. And at one point we will build them.” --- Michael Hansmeyer, TEDGlobal 2012]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The light reflection off various paint may also contribute to the problem. Light and frequency reflection is a complex subject. Some of the pigments we paint with are somewhat iridescent; like a butterfly wing. This is a quantum effect that changes the frequency slightly depending on the direction it is viewed from. It’s not something we usually want but there are iridescent paints out there so be aware of them and experiment.

Complex! But make it simpler. Get the image up on your monitor, tweak it in whatever way you can until you like it. Now paint from it. I still use a printed image but I compare it to my monitor and paint accordingly. When I take a picture of the painting I adjust it until it looks like the painting. I still can’t guarantee that what you see on your monitor will match the painting exactly but no matter what I do I can’t guarantee that.]]></description>

Thanks, you caught a mistake.  I should have said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  If you have a charged particle in a &lt;em&gt;magnetic&lt;/em&gt; field, its momentum is not its mass times its velocity.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and I&#039;m actually going to go back and change that word in my earlier comment.

First, note something more familiar.  The energy of a charged particle in a electric field is not just $latex E = \frac{1}{2} mv^2,$ there&#039;s a correction due to the scalar potential:

$latex E =  \frac{1}{2} mv^2 + q \phi$

where $latex q$ is its charge and $latex \phi$ is the scalar potential at the particle&#039;s location. The scalar potential, also known as the electrostatic potential, is the field with

$latex \vec{E} = - \nabla \phi$

where $latex \vec{E}$ is the electric field.

It turns out that in a similar way, the momentum of a charged particle in a magnetic field is not just $latex \vec p = m \vec{v};$ there&#039;s a correction due to the vector potential:

$latex \displaystyle{ \vec{p} = m \vec v + \frac{q}{c} \vec{A} } $

where $latex c$ is the speed of light and $latex \vec{A}$ is the vector potential.  The vector potential is the field with

$latex \vec{B} = \nabla \times \vec{A} $

where $latex \vec{B}$ is the magnetic field.

All this is nicely explained &lt;a href=&quot;http://galileo.phys.virginia.edu/classes/752.mf1i.spring03/ParticleMagneticField.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>

Okay.  Yeah, when you first start learning physics, &#039;momentum&#039; seems like a fancy name for mass times velocity, perhaps invented by lazy physicists who prefer to write one letter instead of two.

And once upon a time, maybe people thought that&#039;s all momentum was.  But it took on a life of its own and now we realize it&#039;s quite different.  If you have a charged particle in a magnetic field, its momentum is not its mass times its velocity.  And if you have an ordinary particle and take special relativity into account, its momentum is not just its rest mass times its velocity.

So what is momentum?  The real definition of momentum is perhaps easier for waves than for particles.  If you have a wave like

$latex \psi(t,x) = \exp(i (E t - p \cdot x)) $

where $latex t$ is time and $latex x$ is the position vector, then its energy is $latex E$ and its momentum is the vector $latex p.$

So, &lt;em&gt;energy says how rapidly a wave oscillates as you move forwards in time, while momentum in any spatial direction says how fast the wave oscillates as you move in that spatial direction.&lt;/em&gt;

That&#039;s all there is to it, nowadays.]]></description>

John, I was indeed assuming that momentum is proportional to speed.  I&#039;ll read your remedial instruction (thanks) and follow up on the links.

Re: my joke, I get that a lot.  (I&#039;m beginning to think my wife is right about my sense of humor:-)  In this case, the intended humor is that the thing I labeled a &quot;subtle regularity&quot; is (I think) just a consequence of how the .GIF was built.

I &lt;em&gt;assume&lt;/em&gt; the .GIF shows the gyroid being built up layer by layer, as if the gyroid were being printed by a 3D printer.   In which case I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; that the surface normal at the points of joining (the points at which two separate pieces of geoid first touch) must be perpendicular to the planes defining the layers that are being added.]]></description>
