					<description><![CDATA[To understand what a great triumph this is, one needs to see what could have gone wrong! Suppose space had an extra dimension. In 3-dimensional space, Newtonian gravity obeys an inverse square force law because the area of a sphere is proportional to its radius squared. In 4-dimensional space, the force obeys an inverse cube law.  Using a cube instead of a square makes the force stronger at short distances, with dramatic effects. For example, even for the classical 2-body problem, the equations of motion no longer ‘almost always’ have a well-defined solution for all times. For an open set of initial conditions, the particles spiral into each other in a finite amount of time!

The quantum version of this theory is also problematic. The uncertainty principle is not enough to save the day. The inequalities above no longer hold: kinetic energy does not triumph over potential energy. The Hamiltonian is no longer essentially self-adjoint on the set of wavefunctions that I described.]]></description>

&quot;there does not exist a two-dimensional, cylindrically-symmetric surface that will yield rolling marble orbits that are equivalent to the particle orbits of Newtonian gravitation,[3] or for particle orbits that arise in general relativity&quot;

&quot;they found a Kepler-like expression of the form T3 / r2, which is reminiscent of Kepler&#039;s third law for planetary orbits, but with the powers transposed&quot;

We face this problem whenever we try to apply the principle of least action to a field on an infinite-sized chunk of spacetime.  The way people deal with it is to replace &#039;minimization&#039; by a principle saying that if you change your field within some finite-sized region, the quantity you&#039;re trying to minimize doesn&#039;t change, to first order:

$latex \displaystyle{ \frac{d}{ds} S(\phi + s \delta \phi) \vert_{s = 0} = 0} $

where $latex \phi$ is our field, $latex S$ is the quantity we wish to minimize (like action or area), and $latex \delta \phi$ is a change in the field---and we demand $latex \delta \phi = 0$ outside some set of finite volume!

This makes everything well-defined, usually, and we can derive some differential equation that $latex \phi$ should satisfy.  For area-minimizing surfaces this equation was first found &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_surface#History&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;by Lagrange himself&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  If even you say that geometric measure theory is difficult, I wonder if I have time to master it in the rest of my life.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I don&#039;t think you want to.  But you might like to look at a &lt;a href=&quot;http://virtualmathmuseum.org/Surface/gallery_m.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;gallery of minimal surfaces&lt;/a&gt;.  These are typically only area-minimizing in the subtle sense I just described.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  What is the form of the surfaces for $latex n=2, n=3,$ and $latex n=4?$
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I should know some of those, but I don&#039;t!]]></description>

Thanks for the reply.  What would I do without you?  :-)

What happens if the boundary conditions move to infinity?  Can an infinite area be minimized?

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/08/30/the-inverse-cube-force-law/#comment-70835&quot;&gt;Phillip Helbig&lt;/a&gt;.

It&#039;s fairly related.  I believe it&#039;s a pretty reasonable approximation to say your $latex n$-dimensional surface (e.g. rubber band for $latex n = 1$ or trampoline for $latex n = 2$) is trying to minimize its volume (e.g. length for $latex n =1$ or area for $latex n = 2$), subject to the boundary conditions you&#039;re giving it, including the &#039;disturbance&#039; at a chosen point.

At the very least, this makes for a fun and much-studied math problem!  The $latex n = 2$ case is called the theory of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_surface&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;minimal surfaces&lt;/a&gt;.  There are big textbooks on this, and also on the general framework that works in higher dimensions: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_measure_theory&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;geometric measure theory&lt;/a&gt;.

Geometric measure theory is famous for being difficult.  I just noticed that on Amazon, Frank Morgan&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Geometric-Measure-Theory-Fourth-Beginners/dp/012374444X/ref=la_B001KHJ5P8_1_3?s=books&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1441676769&#038;sr=1-3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Geometric Measure Theory: A Beginner&#039;s Guide&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has just one review, a two-star review that says (among other things):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  Yes, the book is ABOUT mathematics, but it contains very little of the gory details that actually constitute the real mathematics, like definitions, theorems and proofs (and the intuition behind it all for that matter). You could say that it is about mathematics written elsewhere. Elsewhere here means &lt;em&gt;Geometric Measure Theory&lt;/em&gt; by Herbert Federer.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the other hand, Federer&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Geometric-Measure-Theory-Classics-Mathematics/dp/3540606564/ref=pd_sim_14_1?ie=UTF8&#038;refRID=1YQFK9VAZGGCPN21011Z&#038;dpSrc=sims&#038;dpST=_AC_UL320_SR210%2C320_&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Geometric Measure Theory&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has some better reviews, but also a one-star review that reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  abandon hope all ye who enter: this is the kind of thing that gives math books a horrible reputation -- absolutely impenetrable to the non initiate --- and written with what perversely seems almost to be a deliberate attempt at obfuscation --- avoid like the plague
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another review suggests getting both Morgan&#039;s book and Federer&#039;s book, and reading them side by side.  And that&#039;s probably good advice!

&lt;i&gt;Anyway&lt;/i&gt;, when your minimal surface isn&#039;t &#039;too warped&#039;, you can approximately describe its height as a function

$latex \phi : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$

obeying the Laplace equation.  Then the things I&#039;m saying about singularities in the gravitational field, or electrostatic field, become rather closely related to your observations.  I think the big difference is that the gravitational field of a point particle obey the equation

$latex \nabla^2 \phi = \delta $

(so, Poisson&#039;s equation with a delta function &#039;source&#039;) while the problem you mention is about

$latex \nabla^2 \phi = 0 $

except at the origin, where

$latex \phi(0) = 1 $

and the points $latex x$ on the sphere of radius 1, where

$latex \phi(x) = 0 $

(so, the Laplace equation with some Dirichlet boundary conditions).]]></description>

I believe it&#8217;s a pretty reasonable approximation to say your <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" />-dimensional surface (e.g. rubber band for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%3D+1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n = 1" class="latex" /> or trampoline for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%3D+2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n = 2" class="latex" />) is trying to minimize its volume (e.g. length for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%3D1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n =1" class="latex" /> or area for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%3D+2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n = 2" class="latex" />), subject to the boundary conditions you&#8217;re giving it, including the &#8216;disturbance&#8217; at a chosen point.</p>
<p>At the very least, this makes for a fun and much-studied math problem!  The <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%3D+2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n = 2" class="latex" /> case is called the theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_surface" rel="nofollow">minimal surfaces</a>.  There are big textbooks on this, and also on the general framework that works in higher dimensions: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_measure_theory" rel="nofollow">geometric measure theory</a>.</p>
<p>Geometric measure theory is famous for being difficult.  I just noticed that on Amazon, Frank Morgan&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Geometric-Measure-Theory-Fourth-Beginners/dp/012374444X/ref=la_B001KHJ5P8_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1441676769&amp;sr=1-3" rel="nofollow"><i>Geometric Measure Theory: A Beginner&#8217;s Guide</i></a> has just one review, a two-star review that says (among other things):</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Yes, the book is ABOUT mathematics, but it contains very little of the gory details that actually constitute the real mathematics, like definitions, theorems and proofs (and the intuition behind it all for that matter). You could say that it is about mathematics written elsewhere. Elsewhere here means <em>Geometric Measure Theory</em> by Herbert Federer.
</p></blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, Federer&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Geometric-Measure-Theory-Classics-Mathematics/dp/3540606564/ref=pd_sim_14_1?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=1YQFK9VAZGGCPN21011Z&amp;dpSrc=sims&amp;dpST=_AC_UL320_SR210%2C320_" rel="nofollow"><i>Geometric Measure Theory</i></a> has some better reviews, but also a one-star review that reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  abandon hope all ye who enter: this is the kind of thing that gives math books a horrible reputation &#8212; absolutely impenetrable to the non initiate &#8212; and written with what perversely seems almost to be a deliberate attempt at obfuscation &#8212; avoid like the plague
</p></blockquote>
<p>Another review suggests getting both Morgan&#8217;s book and Federer&#8217;s book, and reading them side by side.  And that&#8217;s probably good advice!</p>
<p><i>Anyway</i>, when your minimal surface isn&#8217;t &#8216;too warped&#8217;, you can approximately describe its height as a function</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi+%3A+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5En+%5Cto+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;phi : &#92;mathbb{R}^n &#92;to &#92;mathbb{R}" class="latex" /></p>
<p>obeying the Laplace equation.  Then the things I&#8217;m saying about singularities in the gravitational field, or electrostatic field, become rather closely related to your observations.  I think the big difference is that the gravitational field of a point particle obey the equation</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla%5E2+%5Cphi+%3D+%5Cdelta+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;nabla^2 &#92;phi = &#92;delta " class="latex" /></p>
<p>(so, Poisson&#8217;s equation with a delta function &#8216;source&#8217;) while the problem you mention is about</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla%5E2+%5Cphi+%3D+0+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;nabla^2 &#92;phi = 0 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>except at the origin, where</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi%280%29+%3D+1+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;phi(0) = 1 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>and the points <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> on the sphere of radius 1, where</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi%28x%29+%3D+0+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;phi(x) = 0 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>(so, the Laplace equation with some Dirichlet boundary conditions).</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure how closely this is related, but it&#039;s an interesting question nonetheless:

Take a rubber strip (i.e. a cut rubber band, reducing the genus from 1 to 0) fixed at both ends, or a guitar string, or whatever.  Take hold of it somewhere and pull it.  What results are two &lt;i&gt;lines&lt;/i&gt; connecting the end points with the pulled-away point.

Do the same with a two-dimensional analog, e.g. a trampoline.  In this case, the result is not a cone, but rather a curved surface, with the slope greater the closer one is to the &quot;disturbance&quot;.  (Side question: in an ideal case, is the slope infinite when the disturbance is a point?)  Is there an obvious reason for this?  What, exactly, is the form of this curved surface?  Is there a general formula, say for a three-dimensional &quot;surface&quot; embedded in a four-dimensional space?]]></description>
