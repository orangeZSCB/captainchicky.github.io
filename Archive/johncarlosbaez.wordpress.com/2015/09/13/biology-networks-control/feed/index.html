Thanks a lot. I tried reading your book with Jacob Biamonte but could not go far due to my sketchy knowledge in quantum mechanics. So I will start with Wilkinson.]]></description>

Besides the references I gave Touissant, you might also like this introduction to network theory, which is less about using networks as tools to model dynamical systems, and more about ways to take a complicated network and extract information from it:

&#8226; Mark Newman, &lt;i&gt;Networks: An Introduction&lt;/i&gt;, Oxford U. Press, Oxford, 2010.

There&#039;s also this, which I haven&#039;t looked at, but sounds interesting and has good reviews:

&#8226; Matthew O. Jackson, &lt;i&gt;Social and Economic Networks&lt;/i&gt;, Princeton U. Press, Princeton, 2010.

Good luck, and let me know how it goes!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/09/13/biology-networks-control/#comment-71400&quot;&gt;Toussaint&lt;/a&gt;.

I know very little about gene regulatory networks.  So, I started by looking at this:

&#8226; Wikipedia, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_regulatory_network&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Gene regulatory networks&lt;/a&gt;.

Here I read

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Mathematical models of GRNs have been developed to capture the behavior of the system being modeled, and in some cases generate predictions corresponding with experimental observations. In some other cases, models have proven to make accurate novel predictions, which can be tested experimentally, thus suggesting new approaches to explore in an experiment that sometimes wouldn&#039;t be considered in the design of the protocol of an experimental laboratory. The most common modeling technique involves the use of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Several other promising modeling techniques have been used, including Boolean networks, Petri nets, Bayesian networks, graphical Gaussian models, Stochastic, and Process Calculi. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It turns out I know some of the mathematical models here.  I helped write a book on Petri nets, which explains in detail how these are used to describe networks of chemical reactions:

&#8226; John Baez and Jacob Biamonte, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/stoch_stable.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Quantum techniques for stochastic mechanics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.

However, if you wish to avoid hearing about cool analogies to quantum mechanics and focus on biological aspects of Petri nets, I recommend this friendly book:

&#8226; Darren James Wilkinson, &lt;i&gt;Stochastic Modelling for Systems Biology&lt;/i&gt;, Taylor and Francis, New York, 2006.

or for something a bit more terse but still expository, these articles:

&#8226; Peter J. E. Goss and Jean Peccoud, Quantitative modeling of stochastic systems in molecular biology by using stochastic Petri nets, &lt;i&gt;Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;95&lt;/b&gt; (1998), 6750&#8211;6755

&#8226; Ina Koch, Petri nets&#8212;a mathematical formalism to analyze chemical reaction networks, &lt;i&gt;Molecular Informatics&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;29&lt;/b&gt; (2010), 838&#8211;843.

Chemists use a different-looking but very similar formalism, &#039;chemical reaction networks&#039;, which has the advantage that one can deduce lots of things about the differential equations described by these networks simply by looking at the networks!  My book discusses a lot of those results.]]></description>

I&#039;m with Toussaint, where I am new to the mathematical details. His description of what he&#039;s familiar with is similar to my background. I have been using various techniques that seem to overlap with networks to model socio-technical systems (e.g. users + infrastructure).]]></description>

I&#039;m interested in references as well but in my case just biological networks, specifically gene regulatory networks. Since I am new to the mathematical aspects of this field, introductory texts would be most beneficial. My background is in biotechnology. On the math side, I can understand texts that involve differential equations and probability theory (up to Markov processes) but not much beyond or aside those. Thanks]]></description>
