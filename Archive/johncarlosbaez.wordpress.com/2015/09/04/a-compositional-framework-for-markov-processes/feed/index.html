					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m giving a talk on some work I did with Kenny Courser.  It&#039;s part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2020/06/27/act2020-program/&quot;&gt;ACT2020&lt;/a&gt; conference, and it&#039;s happening on 20:40 UTC on Tuesday July 7th, 2020.  (That&#039;s 1:40 pm here in California, just so I don&#039;t forget.)

Like all talks at this conference, you can watch it live &lt;a href=&quot;https://mit.zoom.us/j/7055345747&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;on Zoom&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCOXjXDLt3pZDHGYOIqtg1m1lLOURjl1Q&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.  It&#039;ll also be recorded, so you can watch it later on YouTube too, somewhere &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCOXjXDLt3pYot9VNdLlZqGajHyZUywdI&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

You can see my slides now, and read some other helpful things:

• &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/open_markov/open_markov.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Coarse-graining open Markov processes&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Abstract.&lt;/strong&gt; We illustrate some new paradigms in applied category theory with the example of coarse-graining open Markov processes. Coarse-graining is a standard method of extracting a simpler Markov process from a more complicated one by identifying states. Here we extend coarse-graining to &#039;open&#039; Markov processes: that is, those where probability can flow in or out of certain states called &#039;inputs&#039; and &#039;outputs&#039;. One can build up an ordinary Markov process from smaller open pieces in two basic ways: composition, where we identify the outputs of one open Markov process with the inputs of another, and tensoring, where we set two open Markov processes side by side. These constructions make open Markov processes into the morphisms of a symmetric monoidal category. But we can go further and construct a symmetric monoidal double category where the 2-morphisms include ways of coarse-graining open Markov processes. We can describe the behavior of open Markov processes using double functors out of this double category.

  <strong>Abstract.</strong> We illustrate some new paradigms in applied category theory with the example of coarse-graining open Markov processes. Coarse-graining is a standard method of extracting a simpler Markov process from a more complicated one by identifying states. Here we extend coarse-graining to &#8216;open&#8217; Markov processes: that is, those where probability can flow in or out of certain states called &#8216;inputs&#8217; and &#8216;outputs&#8217;.

These constructions make open Markov processes into the morphisms of a symmetric monoidal category. But we can go further and construct a symmetric monoidal double category where the 2-morphisms include ways of coarse-graining open Markov processes. We can describe the behavior of open Markov processes using double functors out of this double category.

					<description><![CDATA[Two students in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.appliedcategorytheory.org/school/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt; Applied Category Theory 2018 school&lt;/a&gt; wrote a blog article about Brendan Fong&#039;s theory of decorated cospans:

&#8226; Jonathan Lorand and Fabrizio Genovese, &lt;a href=&quot;https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2018/02/hypergraph_categories_of_cospa.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Hypergraph categories of cospans&lt;/a&gt;, The &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-Category Caf&#233;, 28 February 2018.

What&#039;s especially interesting to me is that both Jonathan and Fabrizio know some mathematical physics, and they&#039;re part of a group who will be working with me on some problems as part of the Applied Category Theory 2018 school!  Brendan and Blake Pollard and I used symplectic geometry and decorated cospans to study the black-boxing of &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/04/28/a-compositional-framework-for-passive-linear-networks/&quot;&gt;electrical circuits&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/09/04/a-compositional-framework-for-markov-processes/&quot;&gt;Markov processes&lt;/a&gt;... maybe we should try to go further with that project!]]></description>

A while back, Brendan Fong,  Blake Pollard and I showed that these constructions make open Markov processes into the morphisms of a symmetric monoidal category:

Here Kenny and I go further by constructing a symmetric monoidal &lt;em&gt;double&lt;/em&gt; category where the 2-morphisms include ways of coarse-graining open Markov processes.    We also extend the previously defined &#039;black-boxing&#039; functor from the category of open Markov processes to this double category.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Lately we&#039;ve been thinking about open Markov processes.  These are random processes where something can hop randomly from one state to another (that&#039;s the &#039;Markov process&#039; part) but also enter or leave the system (that&#039;s the &#039;open&#039; part).

The ultimate goal is to understand the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of open systems---systems where energy and maybe matter flows in and out.  If we could understand this well enough, we could understand in detail how &lt;i&gt;life&lt;/i&gt; works.  That&#039;s a difficult job!  But one has to start somewhere, and this is one place to start.

We have a few papers on this subject:

&#8226; Blake Pollard, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.6531&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;A Second Law for open Markov processes&lt;/a&gt;.  (Blog article &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2014/11/15/a-second-law-for-open-markov-processes/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)

&#8226; John Baez, Brendan Fong and Blake Pollard, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.05625&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;A compositional framework for Markov processes&lt;/a&gt;.

&#8226; Blake Pollard, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.00711&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Open Markov processes: A compositional perspective on non-equilibrium steady states in biology&lt;/a&gt;.

					<description><![CDATA[Blake Pollard considers a concrete class of open systems, a very large class called &#039;open Markov processes&#039;.  He shows that nonequilibrium steady states obey the principle of minimum entropy production only approximately---with the approximation being good for steady states that are &lt;em&gt;near equilibrium!&lt;/em&gt;

However, he shows that another minimum principle holds exactly, even for steady states that are far from equilibrium.  He calls this the &#039;principle of minimum dissipation&#039;.

We actually discussed the principle of minimum dissipation in an earlier paper:

&#8226; John Baez, Brendan Fong and Blake Pollard, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.05625&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;A compositional framework for Markov processes&lt;/a&gt;.

But one advantage of Blake&#039;s new paper is that it presents the results with a minimum of category theory.  Of course I love category theory, and I think it&#039;s the right way to formalize open systems, but it can be intimidating.]]></description>
