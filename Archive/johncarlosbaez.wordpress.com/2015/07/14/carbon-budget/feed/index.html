Observations suggest that ECS is likely to be well beyond 1 deg C, and it&#039;s well known that ECS is not a fixed value.

Climate change ethics shows clearly that there&#039;s a moral obligation to act, since there&#039;s already clear evidence of harm, especially to people of poorer nations who have least contributed to the problem and have not consented to be put at risk. Furthermore, economic arguments cannot be ethically used as justification for inaction.]]></description>

Not clear what you mean here. If you mean we&#039;ve already seen +1 deg C, then, yes. we have. If you mean we&#039;ve ONLY seen +1 deg C after 40% atmospheric CO2, then  IMO you do not understand this question at all.  Commenting would seem to require a thourough understanding of what should be done and how.]]></description>

Thanks, Alex!

I agree the IEA chart is potentially misleading, though technically honest: they say the orange bars are &#039;energy-related emissions&#039;, but one might get the idea that this is the only thing causing the blue curve to drop to zero.  Their focus on energy-related emissions probably comes from their overall focus: they&#039;re the International Energy Agency, after all.]]></description>

Great, thanks. The apparently quite significant contribution from non-CO2 GHGs was not part of my zeroth-order picture of climate change (and plots such as the EIA one in this post do not help in that regard, as you point out), but it is now. Much appreciated!]]></description>

So the links you&#039;ve provided just talk about CO2 emissions, which are responsible for about for roughly three quarters of anthropogenic GHG emissions. I think the problem you&#039;re having is resolved when you account for non-CO2 GHGs.

According to the IPCC AR5 WG3 SPM, total anthropogenic GHG emissions from all sources were ~49 Gt CO2eq in 2010, with CO2 from fossil fuels accounting for ~32 Gt of that. This seems roughly consistent with the IEA chart, which seems to give a value of a little less than 32 Gt for energy-related CO2 emissions in 2010. 49/32 = ~1.5, so taking into account non-CO2 GHGs raises emissions by ~50%, as compared to the increase of ~15% you calculated based on including just non-fossil fuel CO2. This raises the estimate for cumulative emissions from now to 2040 to ~375 GtC, which makes more sense.

The IEA chart appears slightly misleading in this context, IMO, as it sort of makes it look like we&#039;re drawing down our carbon budget just though CO2 emissions, when in fact there are a whole range of non-CO2 forcings that need to be accounted for, including non-GHG forcings such as aerosols and albedo changes due to land conversion.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m stumbling a little on the arithmetic here. The orange bars presumably give CO2 (not carbon!) emissions in GtCO2/year. This rate maxes out at what looks like 35 GtCO2/year, in 2040. The ratio between CO2 emissions and carbon emissions happens to be about 3.5, so this gives a max carbon emission rate of 10GtC/year before 2040. But there are only 25 years between now and 2040, so in that time we would only emit ~ 250 of the 400 Gtc remaining in our carbon budget.

But, the plot legend says &quot;energy-related emissions&quot;, so this is presumably not counting cement production and land-use change. Recent numbers (for instance, 
&lt;a HREF=&quot;http://co2now.org/Current-CO2/CO2-Now/global-carbon-emissions.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt; 
here 
&lt;/a&gt;

and

&lt;a HREF=&quot;http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2012/05/09/emissions-from-the-cement-industry/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt; 
here 
&lt;/a&gt; )

suggest that taking these sources into account  raises emissions by ~ 15%. But that raises our estimate of max cumulative emissions between now and 2040 to ~ 290 GtC, still far from 400 GtC. Is the percent of total CO2 emissions which comes from fossil fuels supposed to change drastically in decades to come? If not, how is the preceding arithmetic consistent with the plot and the claim that  we&#039;ll emit 400 GtC in the next 25 years ?]]></description>

I think it also should be noted that it&#039;s not just about probabilities here. Two matters.

First, the cost to civilization of encountering an error to the high side of the density is not the same as encountering an error to the low side.  For, if the actual sensitivity is lower than the midpoint, some of the mitigation done, assuming we do cut emissions, will be done sooner than strictly needed, even if it is eventually needed. If the actual sensitivity is higher than the midpoint, then we may incur costs to civilization in excess of those which would be borne if the sensitivity were at the midpoint, because our mitigation by cutting emissions is not enough. It also depends what should be minimized ... For instance, a case could be made to use something like the 0.8 quantile of climate sensitivity since the associated damages to civilization would then be outrageously high.

Second, climate sensitivity is not a constant.  It is known, for instance, that climate sensitivity goes up as temperatures go up. So, should we, say, allow temperatures to get to the +3 degree Celsius range, it&#039;s not correct to expect an increment of additional increase of carbon dioxide in atmosphere will have the same effect as it would at +1 degree Celsius (essentially where we are now). Just how much that sensitivity increases with temperature is an open question, some of which are &lt;a href=&quot;https://andthentheresphysics.wordpress.com/2015/06/02/non-linear-feedbacks/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;addressed here&lt;/a&gt;  and there&#039;s a plan to study these &lt;a href=&quot;http://wcrp-climate.org/modelling-wgcm-mip-catalogue/modelling-wgcm-mips/450-modelling-wgcm-nonlinmip&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

All that said, I think this is a bit of fiddling while Rome burns, this arguments about temperature sensitivity.  In fact, emissions from most countries continue to increase, let alone decrease, and some of them are accelerating. Also, no one can expect any economy to &quot;stop on a dime&quot;. Finally, the closer one gets to the end of the budget, &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; budget, the more rapid the deceleration needed so as not to overshoot it. The more rapid the deceleration the more damage to the economies which attempt it, including risk of recession. This is the basis for Thomas Stocker&#039;s paper &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.climate.unibe.ch/~stocker/papers/stocker13sci.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The closing door of climate targets&lt;/a&gt;&quot;.]]></description>
