<p>&bull; Gavin E. Crooks, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.0559" rel="nofollow">Measuring thermodynamic length</a>.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;ll tell you a bit about what it actually says!</p>
<p>Remember the story so far: we&#8217;ve got a physical system that&#8217;s in a state of maximum entropy.  I didn&#8217;t emphasize this yet, but that happens whenever our system is in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_equilibrium">thermodynamic equilibrium</a>.  An example would be a box of gas inside a piston.  Suppose you choose any number for the energy of the gas and any number for its volume.   Then there&#8217;s a unique state of the gas that maximizes its entropy, given the constraint that <i>on average</i>, its energy and volume have the values you&#8217;ve chosen.  And this describes what the gas will be like in equilibrium!</p>
<p>Remember, by &#8216;state&#8217; I mean <i>mixed</i> state: it&#8217;s a probabilistic description.  And I say the energy and volume have chosen values <i>on average</i> because there will be random fluctuations.  Indeed, if you look carefully at the head of the piston, you&#8217;ll see it quivering: the volume of the gas only equals the volume you&#8217;ve specified <i>on average</i>.  Same for the energy.</p>
<p>More generally: imagine picking any list of numbers, and finding the maximum entropy state where some chosen observables have these numbers as their average values.  Then there will be fluctuations in the values of these observables &mdash; thermal fluctuations, but also possibly quantum fluctuations.  So, you&#8217;ll get a probability distribution on the space of possible values of your chosen observables.  You should visualize this probability distribution as a little fuzzy cloud centered at the average value!  </p>
<div align="center">
<img width="400" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.math.dartmouth.edu/archive/m22x06/public_html/ellipsoid.jpg" alt="" />
</div>
<p>To a first approximation, this cloud will be shaped like a little ellipsoid.  And if you can pick the average value of your observables to be whatever you&#8217;ll like, you&#8217;ll get lots of little ellipsoids this way, one centered at each point.  And the cool idea is to imagine the space of possible values of your observables as having a weirdly warped geometry, such that <i>relative to this geometry, these ellipsoids are actually spheres</i>.  </p>
<p>This weirdly warped geometry is an example of an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_geometry">&#8216;information geometry&#8217;</a>: a geometry that&#8217;s defined using the concept of information.  This shouldn&#8217;t be surprising: after all, we&#8217;re talking about maximum entropy, and <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/10/12/algorithmic-thermodynamics/">entropy is related to information</a>.  But I want to gradually make this idea more precise.</p>
<p>Bring on the math!</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve got a bunch of observables <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X_1%2C+%5Cdots+%2C+X_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X_1, &#92;dots , X_n" class="latex" />, and we&#8217;re assuming that for any list of numbers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1%2C+%5Cdots+%2C+x_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x_1, &#92;dots , x_n" class="latex" />, the system has a unique maximal-entropy state <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;rho" class="latex" /> for which the expected value of the observable <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X_i" class="latex" /> is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x_i" class="latex" />:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+X_i+%5Crangle+%3D+x_i+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;langle X_i &#92;rangle = x_i " class="latex" /></p>
<p>This state <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;rho" class="latex" /> is called the <b>Gibbs state</b> and I told you how to find it when it exists.   In fact it may not exist for <i>every</i> list of numbers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1%2C+%5Cdots+%2C+x_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x_1, &#92;dots , x_n" class="latex" />, but we&#8217;ll be perfectly happy if it does for all choices of </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%3D+%28x_1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+x_n%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x = (x_1, &#92;dots, x_n) " class="latex" /></p>
<p>lying in some open subset of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5En&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}^n" class="latex" />  </p>
<p>By the way, I should really call this Gibbs state <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho%28x%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;rho(x)" class="latex" /> or something to indicate how it depends on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" />, but I won&#8217;t usually do that.  I expect some intelligence on your part!</p>
<p>Now at each point <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> we can define a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance">covariance matrix</a></p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%28X_i+-+%5Clangle+X_i+%5Crangle%29++%28X_j+-+%5Clangle+X_j+%5Crangle%29++%5Crangle+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;langle (X_i - &#92;langle X_i &#92;rangle)  (X_j - &#92;langle X_j &#92;rangle)  &#92;rangle " class="latex" /></p>
<p>If we take its real part, we get a symmetric matrix:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g_%7Bij%7D+%3D+%5Cmathrm%7BRe%7D+%5Clangle+%28X_i+-+%5Clangle+X_i+%5Crangle%29++%28X_j+-+%5Clangle+X_j+%5Crangle%29++%5Crangle+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="g_{ij} = &#92;mathrm{Re} &#92;langle (X_i - &#92;langle X_i &#92;rangle)  (X_j - &#92;langle X_j &#92;rangle)  &#92;rangle " class="latex" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s also nonnegative &mdash; that&#8217;s easy to see, since the variance of a probability distribution can&#8217;t be negative.  When we&#8217;re lucky this matrix will be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive-definite_matrix">positive definite</a>.  When we&#8217;re even luckier, it will depend smoothly on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" />.  In this case, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g_%7Bij%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="g_{ij}" class="latex" /> will define a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_metric#Riemannian_metrics">Riemannian metric</a> on our open set.   </p>
<p>So far this is all review of <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/10/22/information-geometry/">last time</a>.  Sorry: I seem to have reached the age where I can&#8217;t say anything interesting without warming up for about 15 minutes first.  It&#8217;s like when my mom tells me about an exciting event that happened to her: she starts by saying &#8220;Well, I woke up, and it was cloudy out&#8230;&#8221;  </p>
<p>But now I want to give you an explicit formula for the metric <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g_%7Bij%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="g_{ij}" class="latex" />, and then <i>rewrite it</i> in a way that&#8217;ll work even when the state <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;rho" class="latex" /> is <i>not</i> a maximal-entropy state.  And this formula will then be the general definition of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_information_metric">&#8216;Fisher information metric&#8217;</a> (if we&#8217;re doing classical mechanics), or a quantum version thereof (if we&#8217;re doing quantum mechanics).</p>
<p>Crooks does the classical case &mdash; so let&#8217;s do the quantum case, okay?  Last time I claimed that in the quantum case, our maximum-entropy state is the <b>Gibbs state</b></p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BZ%7D+e%5E%7B-%5Clambda%5Ei+X_i%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;rho = &#92;frac{1}{Z} e^{-&#92;lambda^i X_i}" class="latex" /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda%5Ei&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;lambda^i" class="latex" /> are the &#8216;conjugate variables&#8217; of the observables <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X_i" class="latex" />, we&#8217;re using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_notation">Einstein summation convention</a> to sum over repeated indices that show up once upstairs and once downstairs, and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Z" class="latex" /> is the <b>partition function</b></p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z+%3D+%5Cmathrm%7Btr%7D+%28e%5E%7B-%5Clambda%5Ei+X_i%7D%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Z = &#92;mathrm{tr} (e^{-&#92;lambda^i X_i})" class="latex" /></p>
<p>(To be honest: last time I wrote the indices on the conjugate variables <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda%5Ei&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;lambda^i" class="latex" /> as subscripts rather than superscripts, because I didn&#8217;t want some poor schlep out there to think that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda%5E1%2C+%5Cdots+%2C+%5Clambda%5En&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;lambda^1, &#92;dots , &#92;lambda^n" class="latex" /> were the powers of some number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;lambda" class="latex" />.  But now I&#8217;m assuming you&#8217;re all grown up and ready to juggle indices!  We&#8217;re doing Riemannian geometry, after all.)</p>
<p>Also last time I claimed that it&#8217;s tremendously fun and enlightening to take the derivative of the logarithm of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Z" class="latex" />.  The reason is that it gives you the mean values of your observables:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+X_i+%5Crangle+%3D+-+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial%7D%7B%5Cpartial+%5Clambda%5Ei%7D+%5Cln+Z+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;langle X_i &#92;rangle = - &#92;frac{&#92;partial}{&#92;partial &#92;lambda^i} &#92;ln Z " class="latex" /></p>
<p>But now let&#8217;s take the derivative of the logarithm of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;rho" class="latex" />.  Remember, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;rho" class="latex" /> is an operator &mdash; in fact a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_matrix">density matrix</a>.  But we can take its logarithm as explained last time, and the usual rules apply, so starting from</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BZ%7D+e%5E%7B-%5Clambda%5Ei+X_i%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;rho = &#92;frac{1}{Z} e^{-&#92;lambda^i X_i}" class="latex" /></p>
<p>we get</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7Bln%7D%5C%2C+%5Crho+%3D+-+%5Clambda%5Ei+X_i+-+%5Cmathrm%7Bln%7D+%5C%2CZ+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{ln}&#92;, &#92;rho = - &#92;lambda^i X_i - &#92;mathrm{ln} &#92;,Z " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Next, let&#8217;s differentiate both sides with respect to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda%5Ei&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;lambda^i" class="latex" />.  Why?  Well, from what I just said, you should be itching to differentiate <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7Bln%7D%5C%2C+Z&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{ln}&#92;, Z" class="latex" />.   So let&#8217;s give in to that temptation:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial++%7D%7B%5Cpartial+%5Clambda%5Ei%7D+%5Cmathrm%7Bln%7D++%5Crho+%3D+-X_i+%2B+%5Clangle+X_i+%5Crangle&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;frac{&#92;partial  }{&#92;partial &#92;lambda^i} &#92;mathrm{ln}  &#92;rho = -X_i + &#92;langle X_i &#92;rangle" class="latex" /> </p>
<p>Hey!  Now we&#8217;ve got a formula for the &#8216;fluctuation&#8217; of the observable <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X_i" class="latex" /> &mdash; that is, how much it differs from its mean value:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X_i+-+%5Clangle+X_i+%5Crangle+%3D+-+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+%5Cmathrm%7Bln%7D+%5Crho+%7D%7B%5Cpartial+%5Clambda%5Ei%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X_i - &#92;langle X_i &#92;rangle = - &#92;frac{&#92;partial &#92;mathrm{ln} &#92;rho }{&#92;partial &#92;lambda^i}" class="latex" /></p>
<p>This is incredibly cool!  I should have learned this formula decades ago, but somehow I just bumped into it now.  I knew of course that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7Bln%7D+%5C%2C+%5Crho&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{ln} &#92;, &#92;rho" class="latex" /> shows up in the formula for the <b>entropy</b>:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%28%5Crho%29+%3D+%5Cmathrm%7Btr%7D+%28+%5Crho+%5C%3B+%5Cmathrm%7Bln%7D+%5C%2C+%5Crho%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S(&#92;rho) = &#92;mathrm{tr} ( &#92;rho &#92;; &#92;mathrm{ln} &#92;, &#92;rho) " class="latex" /></p>
<p>But I never had the brains to think about <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7Bln%7D%5C%2C+%5Crho&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{ln}&#92;, &#92;rho" class="latex" /> all by itself.  So I&#8217;m really excited to discover that it&#8217;s an interesting entity in its own right &mdash; and fun to differentiate, just like <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7Bln%7D%5C%2C+Z&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{ln}&#92;, Z" class="latex" />.  </p>
<p>Now we get our cool formula for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g_%7Bij%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="g_{ij}" class="latex" />.  Remember, it&#8217;s defined by</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g_%7Bij%7D+%3D+%5Cmathrm%7BRe%7D+%5Clangle+%28X_i+-+%5Clangle+X_i+%5Crangle%29++%28X_j+-+%5Clangle+X_j+%5Crangle%29++%5Crangle+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="g_{ij} = &#92;mathrm{Re} &#92;langle (X_i - &#92;langle X_i &#92;rangle)  (X_j - &#92;langle X_j &#92;rangle)  &#92;rangle " class="latex" /></p>
<p>But now that we know </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X_i+-+%5Clangle+X_i+%5Crangle+%3D+-%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+%5Cmathrm%7Bln%7D+%5Crho+%7D%7B%5Cpartial+%5Clambda%5Ei%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X_i - &#92;langle X_i &#92;rangle = -&#92;frac{&#92;partial &#92;mathrm{ln} &#92;rho }{&#92;partial &#92;lambda^i}" class="latex" /></p>
<p>we get the formula we were looking for:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g_%7Bij%7D+%3D+%5Cmathrm%7BRe%7D+%5Clangle+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+%5Cmathrm%7Bln%7D+%5Crho+%7D%7B%5Cpartial+%5Clambda%5Ei%7D+%5C%3B+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+%5Cmathrm%7Bln%7D+%5Crho+%7D%7B%5Cpartial+%5Clambda%5Ej%7D++%5Crangle+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="g_{ij} = &#92;mathrm{Re} &#92;langle &#92;frac{&#92;partial &#92;mathrm{ln} &#92;rho }{&#92;partial &#92;lambda^i} &#92;; &#92;frac{&#92;partial &#92;mathrm{ln} &#92;rho }{&#92;partial &#92;lambda^j}  &#92;rangle " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Beautiful, eh?  And of course the expected value of any observable <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> in the state <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;rho" class="latex" /> is</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+A+%5Crangle+%3D+%5Cmathrm%7Btr%7D%28%5Crho+A%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;langle A &#92;rangle = &#92;mathrm{tr}(&#92;rho A)" class="latex" /></p>
<p>so we can also write the covariance matrix like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g_%7Bij%7D+%3D+%5Cmathrm%7BRe%7D%5C%2C+%5Cmathrm%7Btr%7D%28%5Crho+%5C%3B+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+%5Cmathrm%7Bln%7D+%5Crho+%7D%7B%5Cpartial+%5Clambda%5Ei%7D+%5C%3B+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+%5Cmathrm%7Bln%7D+%5Crho+%7D%7B%5Cpartial+%5Clambda%5Ej%7D+%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="g_{ij} = &#92;mathrm{Re}&#92;, &#92;mathrm{tr}(&#92;rho &#92;; &#92;frac{&#92;partial &#92;mathrm{ln} &#92;rho }{&#92;partial &#92;lambda^i} &#92;; &#92;frac{&#92;partial &#92;mathrm{ln} &#92;rho }{&#92;partial &#92;lambda^j} ) " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Lo and behold!  This formula makes sense whenever <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;rho" class="latex" /> is <i>any</i> density matrix depending smoothly on some parameters <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda%5Ei&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;lambda^i" class="latex" />.  We don&#8217;t need it to be a Gibbs state!   So, we can work more generally.</p>
<p>Indeed, whenever we have <i>any</i> smooth function from a manifold to the space of density matrices for some Hilbert space, we can define <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g_%7Bij%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="g_{ij}" class="latex" /> by the above formula!  And when it&#8217;s positive definite, we get a Riemannian metric on our manifold: the <b>Bures information metric</b>.</p>
<p>The classical analogue is the somewhat more well-known &#8216;Fisher information metric&#8217;.  When we go from quantum to classical, operators become functions and traces become integrals.  There&#8217;s nothing complex anymore, so taking the real part becomes unnecessary.  So the Fisher information metric looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g_%7Bij%7D+%3D+%5Cint_%5COmega+p%28%5Comega%29+%5C%3B+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+%5Cmathrm%7Bln%7D+p%28%5Comega%29+%7D%7B%5Cpartial+%5Clambda%5Ei%7D+%5C%3B+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+%5Cmathrm%7Bln%7D+p%28%5Comega%29+%7D%7B%5Cpartial+%5Clambda%5Ej%7D+%5C%3B+d+%5Comega+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="g_{ij} = &#92;int_&#92;Omega p(&#92;omega) &#92;; &#92;frac{&#92;partial &#92;mathrm{ln} p(&#92;omega) }{&#92;partial &#92;lambda^i} &#92;; &#92;frac{&#92;partial &#92;mathrm{ln} p(&#92;omega) }{&#92;partial &#92;lambda^j} &#92;; d &#92;omega " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Here I&#8217;m assuming we&#8217;ve got a smooth function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p" class="latex" /> from some manifold <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="M" class="latex" /> to the space of probability distributions on some measure space <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5COmega%2C+d%5Comega%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(&#92;Omega, d&#92;omega)" class="latex" />.    Working in local coordinates <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda%5Ei&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;lambda^i" class="latex" /> on our manifold <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="M" class="latex" />, the above formula defines a Riemannian metric on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="M" class="latex" />, at least when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g_%7Bij%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="g_{ij}" class="latex" /> is positive definite.  And that&#8217;s the <b>Fisher information metric</b>!</p>
<p>Crooks says more: he describes an experiment that would let you measure the length of a path with respect to the Fisher information metric &mdash; at least in the case where the state <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho%28x%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;rho(x)" class="latex" /> is the Gibbs state with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+X_i+%5Crangle+%3D+x_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;langle X_i &#92;rangle = x_i" class="latex" />.   And that explains why he calls it &#8216;thermodynamic length&#8217;.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot more to say about this, and also about another question: <i>What use is the Fisher information metric in the general case where the states <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho%28x%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;rho(x)" class="latex" /> aren&#8217;t Gibbs states?</i></p>
<p>But it&#8217;s dinnertime, so I&#8217;ll stop here.</p>
<p>[Note: in the original version of this post, I omitted the real part in my definition <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g_%7Bij%7D+%3D+%5Cmathrm%7BRe%7D+%5Clangle+%28X_i+-+%5Clangle+X_i+%5Crangle%29++%28X_j+-+%5Clangle+X_j+%5Crangle%29++%5Crangle+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="g_{ij} = &#92;mathrm{Re} &#92;langle (X_i - &#92;langle X_i &#92;rangle)  (X_j - &#92;langle X_j &#92;rangle)  &#92;rangle " class="latex" />, giving a &#8216;Riemannian metric&#8217; that was <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/10/29/information-geometry-part-4/">neither real nor symmetric</a> in the quantum case.  Most of the comments below are based on that original version, not the new fixed one.]</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>I&#8217;d like to provide a bit of background to this interesting paper:</p>
<p>&bull; Gavin E. Crooks, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.0559" rel="nofollow">Measuring thermodynamic length</a>.</p>
<p>which was pointed out by <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/10/19/entropy-and-uncertainty/#comment-2092">John F</a> in our discussion of <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/10/19/entropy-and-uncertainty/">entropy and uncertainty</a>.  </p>
<p>The idea here should work for either classical or quantum statistical mechanics.  The paper describes the classical version, so just for a change of pace let me describe the quantum version.</p>
<p>First a lightning review of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_statistical_mechanics">quantum statistical mechanics</a>.  Suppose you have a quantum system with some Hilbert space.  When you know as much as possible about your system, then you describe it by a unit vector in this Hilbert space, and you say your system is in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_state#Pure_states_as_rays_in_a_Hilbert_space"><b>pure state</b></a>.  Sometimes people just call a pure state a &#8216;state&#8217;.  But that can be confusing, because in statistical mechanics you also need more general &#8216;mixed states&#8217; where you <i>don&#8217;t</i> know as much as possible.   A mixed state is described by a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_matrix"><b>density matrix</b></a>, meaning a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_element">positive operator</a> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;rho" class="latex" /> with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trace_%28linear_algebra%29">trace</a> equal to 1:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7Btr%7D%28%5Crho%29+%3D+1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{tr}(&#92;rho) = 1" class="latex" /></p>
<p>The idea is that any observable is described by a self-adjoint operator <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" />, and the expected value of this observable in the mixed state <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;rho" class="latex" /> is</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+A+%5Crangle+%3D+%5Cmathrm%7Btr%7D%28%5Crho+A%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;langle A &#92;rangle = &#92;mathrm{tr}(&#92;rho A)" class="latex" /></p>
<p>The <b>entropy</b> of a mixed state is defined by</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%28%5Crho%29+%3D+-%5Cmathrm%7Btr%7D%28%5Crho+%5C%3B+%5Cmathrm%7Bln%7D+%5C%2C+%5Crho%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S(&#92;rho) = -&#92;mathrm{tr}(&#92;rho &#92;; &#92;mathrm{ln} &#92;, &#92;rho)" class="latex" /></p>
<p>where we take the logarithm of the density matrix just by taking the log of each of its eigenvalues, while keeping the same eigenvectors.   This formula for entropy should remind you of the one that Gibbs and Shannon used &mdash; the one I explained <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/10/12/algorithmic-thermodynamics/">a while back</a>.  </p>
<p>Back then I told you about the &#8216;Gibbs ensemble&#8217;: the mixed state that maximizes entropy subject to the constraint that some observable have a given value.  We can do the same thing in quantum mechanics, and we can even do it for a bunch of observables at once.  Suppose we have some observables <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X_1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+X_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X_1, &#92;dots, X_n" class="latex" /> and we want to find the mixed state <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;rho" class="latex" /> that maximizes entropy subject to these constraints:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+X_i+%5Crangle+%3D+x_i+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;langle X_i &#92;rangle = x_i " class="latex" /></p>
<p>for some numbers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x_i" class="latex" />.  Then a little exercise in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_multipliers">Lagrange multipliers</a> shows that the answer is the <b>Gibbs state</b>:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BZ%7D+%5Cmathrm%7Bexp%7D%28-%5Clambda_1+X_1+%2B+%5Ccdots+%2B+%5Clambda_n+X_n%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;rho = &#92;frac{1}{Z} &#92;mathrm{exp}(-&#92;lambda_1 X_1 + &#92;cdots + &#92;lambda_n X_n) " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Huh?  <img src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/emoticons/sm_confused.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>This answer needs some explanation.  First of all, the numbers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda_1%2C+%5Cdots+%5Clambda_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;lambda_1, &#92;dots &#92;lambda_n" class="latex" /> are called Lagrange multipliers.  You have to choose them right to get </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+X_i+%5Crangle+%3D+x_i+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;langle X_i &#92;rangle = x_i " class="latex" /></p>
<p>So, in favorable cases, they will be functions of the numbers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x_i" class="latex" />.  And when you&#8217;re really lucky, you can solve for the numbers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x_i" class="latex" /> in terms of the numbers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;lambda_i" class="latex" />.  We call <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;lambda_i" class="latex" /> the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_variables_%28thermodynamics%29"><b>conjugate variable</b></a> of the observable <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X_i" class="latex" />.  For example, the conjugate variable of energy is inverse temperature! </p>
<p>Second of all, we take the exponential of a self-adjoint operator just as we took the logarithm of a density matrix: just take the exponential of each eigenvalue.  </p>
<p>(At least this works when our self-adjoint operator has only eigenvalues in its spectrum, not any <a>continuous spectrum</a>.  Otherwise we need to get serious and use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_calculus">functional calculus</a>.  Luckily, if your system&#8217;s Hilbert space is finite-dimensional, you can ignore this parenthetical remark!)</p>
<p>But third: what&#8217;s that number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Z" class="latex" />?  It begins life as a humble normalizing factor.  Its job is to make sure <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;rho" class="latex" /> has trace equal to 1:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z+%3D+%5Cmathrm%7Btr%7D%28%5Cmathrm%7Bexp%7D%28-%5Clambda_1+X_1+%2B+%5Ccdots+%2B+%5Clambda_n+X_n%29%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Z = &#92;mathrm{tr}(&#92;mathrm{exp}(-&#92;lambda_1 X_1 + &#92;cdots + &#92;lambda_n X_n)) " class="latex" /></p>
<p>However, once you get going, it becomes incredibly important!  It&#8217;s called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_function_%28statistical_mechanics%29"><b>partition function</b></a> of your system.</p>
<p>As an example of what it&#8217;s good for, it turns out you can compute the numbers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x_i" class="latex" /> as follows:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_i+%3D+-+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial%7D%7B%5Cpartial+%5Clambda_i%7D+%5Cmathrm%7Bln%7D+Z&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x_i = - &#92;frac{&#92;partial}{&#92;partial &#92;lambda_i} &#92;mathrm{ln} Z" class="latex" /></p>
<p>In other words, you can compute the expected values of the observables <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X_i" class="latex" /> by differentiating the log of the partition function:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+X_i+%5Crangle+%3D+-+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial%7D%7B%5Cpartial+%5Clambda_i%7D+%5Cmathrm%7Bln%7D+Z&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;langle X_i &#92;rangle = - &#92;frac{&#92;partial}{&#92;partial &#92;lambda_i} &#92;mathrm{ln} Z" class="latex" /></p>
<p>Or in still other words,</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+X_i+%5Crangle+%3D+-+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BZ%7D+%5C%3B+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+Z%7D%7B%5Cpartial+%5Clambda_i%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;langle X_i &#92;rangle = - &#92;frac{1}{Z} &#92;; &#92;frac{&#92;partial Z}{&#92;partial &#92;lambda_i}" class="latex" /> </p>
<p>To believe this you just have to take the equations I&#8217;ve given you so far and mess around &mdash; there&#8217;s really no substitute for doing it yourself.  I&#8217;ve done it fifty times, and every time I feel smarter.</p>
<p>But we can go further: after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value">&#8216;expected value&#8217;</a> or &#8216;mean&#8217; of an observable comes its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance">variance</a>, which is the square of its standard deviation:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5CDelta+A%29%5E2+%3D+%5Clangle+A%5E2+%5Crangle+-+%5Clangle+A+%5Crangle%5E2+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(&#92;Delta A)^2 = &#92;langle A^2 &#92;rangle - &#92;langle A &#92;rangle^2 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>This measures the size of fluctuations around the mean.  And in the Gibbs state, we can compute the variance of the observable <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X_i" class="latex" /> as the <i>second</i> derivative of the log of the partition function:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+X_i%5E2+%5Crangle+-+%5Clangle+X_i+%5Crangle%5E2+%3D++%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial%5E2%7D%7B%5Cpartial%5E2+%5Clambda_i%7D+%5Cmathrm%7Bln%7D+Z&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;langle X_i^2 &#92;rangle - &#92;langle X_i &#92;rangle^2 =  &#92;frac{&#92;partial^2}{&#92;partial^2 &#92;lambda_i} &#92;mathrm{ln} Z" class="latex" /></p>
<p>Again: calculate and see.</p>
<p>But when we&#8217;ve got lots of observables, there&#8217;s something better than the variance of each one.  There&#8217;s the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance">covariance matrix</a> of the whole lot of them!  Each observable <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X_i" class="latex" /> fluctuates around its mean value <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x_i" class="latex" />&#8230; but these fluctuations are not independent!  They&#8217;re <i>correlated</i>, and the covariance matrix says how.  </p>
<p>All this is very visual, at least for me.  If you imagine the fluctuations as forming a blurry patch near the point <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x_1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+x_n%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(x_1, &#92;dots, x_n)" class="latex" />, this patch will be ellipsoidal in shape, at least when all our random fluctuations are Gaussian.  And then the <i>shape</i> of this ellipsoid is precisely captured by the covariance matrix!  In particular, the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix will point along the principal axes of this ellipsoid, and the eigenvalues will say how stretched out the ellipsoid is in each direction!</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="400" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.math.dartmouth.edu/archive/m22x06/public_html/ellipsoid.jpg" alt="" />
</div>
<p>To understand the covariance matrix, it may help to start by rewriting the variance of a single observable <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> as</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5CDelta+A%29%5E2+%3D+%5Clangle+%28A+-+%5Clangle+A+%5Crangle%29%5E2+%5Crangle+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(&#92;Delta A)^2 = &#92;langle (A - &#92;langle A &#92;rangle)^2 &#92;rangle " class="latex" /></p>
<p>That&#8217;s a lot of angle brackets, but the meaning should be clear. First we look at the difference between our observable and its mean value, namely </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+-+%5Clangle+A+%5Crangle&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A - &#92;langle A &#92;rangle" class="latex" /></p>
<p>Then we square this, to get something that&#8217;s big and positive whenever our observable is far from its mean.  Then we take the mean value of the <i>that</i>, to get an idea of how far our observable is from the mean <i>on average</i>.</p>
<p>We can use the same trick to define the covariance of a bunch of observables <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X_i" class="latex" />.   We get an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%5Ctimes+n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n &#92;times n" class="latex" /> matrix called the <b>covariance matrix</b>, whose entry in the <i>i</i>th row and <i>j</i>th column is</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%28X_i+-+%5Clangle+X_i+%5Crangle%29++%28X_j+-+%5Clangle+X_j+%5Crangle%29++%5Crangle+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;langle (X_i - &#92;langle X_i &#92;rangle)  (X_j - &#92;langle X_j &#92;rangle)  &#92;rangle " class="latex" /></p>
<p>If you think about it, you can see that this will measure correlations in the fluctuations of your observables.  </p>
<p>An interesting difference between classical and quantum mechanics shows up here.  In classical mechanics the covariance matrix is always symmetric &mdash; but not in quantum mechanics!  You see, in classical mechanics, whenever we have two observables <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B" class="latex" />, we have</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+A+B+%5Crangle+%3D+%5Clangle+B+A+%5Crangle&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;langle A B &#92;rangle = &#92;langle B A &#92;rangle" class="latex" /></p>
<p>since observables commute.  But in quantum mechanics this is not true!  For example, consider the position <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="q" class="latex" /> and momentum <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p" class="latex" /> of a particle.  We have</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q+p+%3D+p+q+%2B+i+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="q p = p q + i " class="latex" /></p>
<p>so taking expectation values we get</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+q+p+%5Crangle+%3D+%5Clangle+p+q+%5Crangle+%2B+i+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;langle q p &#92;rangle = &#92;langle p q &#92;rangle + i " class="latex" /></p>
<p>So, it&#8217;s easy to get a non-symmetric covariance matrix when our observables <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X_i" class="latex" /> don&#8217;t commute.  However, the <i>real part</i> of the covariance matrix is symmetric, even in quantum mechanics.   So let&#8217;s define </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g_%7Bij%7D+%3D++%5Cmathrm%7BRe%7D++%5Clangle+%28X_i+-+%5Clangle+X_i+%5Crangle%29++%28X_j+-+%5Clangle+X_j+%5Crangle%29++%5Crangle+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="g_{ij} =  &#92;mathrm{Re}  &#92;langle (X_i - &#92;langle X_i &#92;rangle)  (X_j - &#92;langle X_j &#92;rangle)  &#92;rangle " class="latex" /></p>
<p>You can check that the matrix entries here are the second derivatives of the partition function:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g_%7Bij%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial%5E2%7D%7B%5Cpartial+%5Clambda_i+%5Cpartial+%5Clambda_j%7D+%5Cmathrm%7Bln%7D+Z+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="g_{ij} = &#92;frac{&#92;partial^2}{&#92;partial &#92;lambda_i &#92;partial &#92;lambda_j} &#92;mathrm{ln} Z " class="latex" /></p>
<p>And now for the cool part: this is where information geometry comes in!  Suppose that for any choice of values <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x_i" class="latex" /> we have a Gibbs state with</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+X_i+%5Crangle+%3D+x_i+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;langle X_i &#92;rangle = x_i " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Then for each point </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%3D+%28x_1%2C+%5Cdots+%2C+x_n%29+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5En&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x = (x_1, &#92;dots , x_n) &#92;in &#92;mathbb{R}^n" class="latex" /> </p>
<p>we have a matrix</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g_%7Bij%7D+%3D++%5Cmathrm%7BRe%7D++%5Clangle+%28X_i+-+%5Clangle+X_i+%5Crangle%29++%28X_j+-+%5Clangle+X_j+%5Crangle%29++%5Crangle+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial%5E2%7D%7B%5Cpartial+%5Clambda_i+%5Cpartial+%5Clambda_j%7D+%5Cmathrm%7Bln%7D+Z+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="g_{ij} =  &#92;mathrm{Re}  &#92;langle (X_i - &#92;langle X_i &#92;rangle)  (X_j - &#92;langle X_j &#92;rangle)  &#92;rangle = &#92;frac{&#92;partial^2}{&#92;partial &#92;lambda_i &#92;partial &#92;lambda_j} &#92;mathrm{ln} Z " class="latex" /></p>
<p>And this matrix is not only symmetric, it&#8217;s also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_operator">positive</a>.  And when it&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive-definite_matrix">positive definite</a> we can think of it as an inner product on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_space">tangent space</a> of the point <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" />.  In other words, we get a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_metric#Riemannian_metrics">Riemannian metric</a> on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5En&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}^n" class="latex" />.  This is called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_information_metric"><b>Fisher information metric</b></a>.</p>
<p>I hope you can see through the jargon to the simple idea.  We&#8217;ve got a space. Each point <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> in this space describes the maximum-entropy state of a quantum system for which our observables have specified mean values.  But in each of these states, the observables are random variables.  They don&#8217;t just sit at their mean value, they fluctuate!  You can picture these fluctuations as forming a little smeared-out blob in our space.  To a first approximation, this blob is an ellipsoid.  And if we think of this ellipsoid as a &#8216;unit ball&#8217;, it gives us a standard for measuring the <i>length</i> of any little vector sticking out of our point.  In other words, we&#8217;ve got a Riemannian metric: <i>the Fisher information metric!</i></p>
<p>Now if you look at the Wikipedia article you&#8217;ll see a more general but to me somewhat <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_information_metric">scarier definition</a> of the Fisher information metric.  This applies whenever we&#8217;ve got a manifold whose points label <i>arbitrary</i> mixed states of a system.  But Crooks shows this definition reduces to his &mdash; the one I just described &mdash; when our manifold is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5En&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}^n" class="latex" /> and it&#8217;s parametrizing Gibbs states in the way we&#8217;ve just seen.  </p>
<p>More precisely: both Crooks and the Wikipedia article describe the classical story, but it parallels the quantum story I&#8217;ve been telling&#8230; and I think the quantum version is well-known.  I believe the quantum version of the Fisher information metric is sometimes called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bures_metric">Bures metric</a>, though I&#8217;m a bit confused about what the Bures metric actually is.</p>
<p>[Note: in the original version of this post, I omitted the real part in my definition <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g_%7Bij%7D+%3D+%5Cmathrm%7BRe%7D+%5Clangle+%28X_i+-+%5Clangle+X_i+%5Crangle%29++%28X_j+-+%5Clangle+X_j+%5Crangle%29++%5Crangle+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="g_{ij} = &#92;mathrm{Re} &#92;langle (X_i - &#92;langle X_i &#92;rangle)  (X_j - &#92;langle X_j &#92;rangle)  &#92;rangle " class="latex" />, giving a &#8216;Riemannian metric&#8217; that was <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/10/29/information-geometry-part-4/">neither real nor symmetric</a> in the quantum case.  Most of the comments below are based on that original version, not the new fixed one.]</p>

					<p><i>guest post by <b><a href="http://www.marcallenharper.com/">Marc Harper</a></b></i></p>
<p>In John&#8217;s <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/information/index.html">information geometry</a> series, he mentioned some of my work in evolutionary dynamics. Today I&#8217;m going to tell you about some exciting extensions!</p>
<h3> The replicator equation </h3>
<p>First a little refresher. For a population of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" /> replicating types, such as individuals with different eye colors or a gene with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" /> distinct <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele">alleles</a>, the &#8216;replicator equation&#8217; expresses the main idea of natural selection: the relative rate of growth of each type should be proportional to the difference between the fitness of the type and the mean fitness in the population.</p>
<p>To see why this equation should be true, let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="P_i" class="latex" /> be the population of individuals of the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i" class="latex" />th type, which we allow to be any nonnegative real number.  We can list all these numbers and get a vector:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P+%3D+%28P_1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+P_n%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="P = (P_1, &#92;dots, P_n) " class="latex" /></p>
<p>The <b>Lotka&ndash;Volterra equation</b> is a very general rule for how these numbers can change with time:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7Bd+P_i%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D+f_i%28P%29+P_i+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{d P_i}{d t} = f_i(P) P_i } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Each population grows at a rate proportional to itself, where the &#8216;constant of proportionality&#8217;, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_i%28P%29%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_i(P)," class="latex" /> is not necessarily constant: it can be any real-valued function of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="P." class="latex" />  This function is called the <b>fitness</b> of the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i" class="latex" />th type.  Taken all together, these functions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_i" class="latex" /> are called the <b>fitness landscape</b>.</p>
<p>Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p_i" class="latex" /> be the fraction of individuals who are of the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i" class="latex" />th type:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+p_i+%3D+%5Cfrac%7BP_i%7D%7B%5Csum_%7Bi+%3D1%7D%5En+P_i+%7D+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ p_i = &#92;frac{P_i}{&#92;sum_{i =1}^n P_i } }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>These numbers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p_i" class="latex" /> are between 0 and 1, and they add up to 1.  So, we can also think of them as probabilities: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p_i" class="latex" /> is the probability that a randomly chosen individual is of the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i" class="latex" />th type.  This is how probability theory, and eventually entropy, gets into the game.</p>
<p>Again, we can bundle these numbers into a vector:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p+%3D+%28p_1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+p_n%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p = (p_1, &#92;dots, p_n) " class="latex" /></p>
<p>which we call the <b>population distribution</b>.  It turns out that the Lotka&ndash;Volterra equation implies the <b>replicator equation</b>:</p>

<p>is the <b>mean fitness</b> of all the individuals.  You can see the proof in <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/information/information_geometry_9.html">Part 9</a> of the information geometry series.</p>
<p>By the way: if each fitness <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_i%28P%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_i(P)" class="latex" /> only depends on the fraction of individuals of each type, not the total numbers, we can write the replicator equation in a simpler way:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7Bd+p_i%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D+%5Cleft%28+f_i%28p%29+-+%5Clangle+f%28p%29+%5Crangle+%5Cright%29+%5C%2C+p_i+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{d p_i}{d t} = &#92;left( f_i(p) - &#92;langle f(p) &#92;rangle &#92;right) &#92;, p_i } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>From now on, when talking about this equation, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll do.</p>
<p>Anyway, the take-home message is this: the replicator equation says the fraction of individuals of any type changes at a rate proportional to fitness of that type minus the mean fitness.</p>
<p>Now, it has been known since the late 1970s or early 1980s, thanks to the work of Akin, Bomze, Hofbauer, Shahshahani, and others, that the replicator equation has some very interesting properties.   For one thing, it often makes &#8216;relative entropy&#8217; decrease.   For another, it&#8217;s often an example of &#8216;gradient flow&#8217;.   Let&#8217;s look at both of these in turn, and then talk about some new generalizations of these facts.</p>
<h3> Relative entropy as a Lyapunov function </h3>
<p>I mentioned that we can think of a population distribution as a probability distribution.  This lets us take ideas from probability theory and even information theory and apply them to evolutionary dynamics!  For example, given two population distributions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="q," class="latex" /> the <b>information</b> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="q" class="latex" /> <b>relative to</b> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p" class="latex" /> is</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I%28q%2Cp%29+%3D+%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Csum_i+q_i+%5Cln+%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7Bq_i%7D%7Bp_i+%7D%5Cright%29%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="I(q,p) = &#92;displaystyle{ &#92;sum_i q_i &#92;ln &#92;left(&#92;frac{q_i}{p_i }&#92;right)} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>This measures how much information you gain if you have a hypothesis about some state of affairs given by the probability distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p," class="latex" /> and then someone tells you &#8220;no, the best hypothesis is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="q" class="latex" />!”</p>
<p>It may seem weird to treat a <i>population distribution</i> as a <i>hypothesis</i>, but this turns out to be a good idea.  Evolution can then be seen as a learning process: a process of improving the hypothesis.</p>
<p>We can make this precise by seeing how the relative information changes with the passage of time.  Suppose we have two population distributions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="q" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p." class="latex" />   Suppose <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="q" class="latex" /> is fixed, while <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p" class="latex" /> evolves in time according to the replicator equation.  Then</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B++%5Cfrac%7Bd%7D%7Bd+t%7D+I%28q%2Cp%29++%3D++%5Csum_i+f_i%28P%29+%28p_i+-+q_i%29+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{  &#92;frac{d}{d t} I(q,p)  =  &#92;sum_i f_i(P) (p_i - q_i) } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>For the proof, see <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/06/07/information-geometry-part-11/">Part 11</a> of the information geometry series.</p>
<p>So, the information of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="q" class="latex" /> relative to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p" class="latex" /> will decrease as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p" class="latex" /> evolves according to the replicator equation if</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B++%5Csum_i+f_i%28P%29+%28p_i+-+q_i%29+%7D+%5Cle+0+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{  &#92;sum_i f_i(P) (p_i - q_i) } &#92;le 0 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="q" class="latex" /> makes this true for all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p," class="latex" /> we say <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="q" class="latex" /> is an <b>evolutionarily stable state</b>.   For some reasons why, see <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/06/26/information-geometry-part-13/">Part 13</a>.</p>
<p>What matters now is that when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="q" class="latex" /> is an evolutionarily stable state, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I%28q%2Cp%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="I(q,p)" class="latex" /> says how much information the population has &#8216;left to learn&#8217;&mdash;and we&#8217;re seeing that this always <i>decreases</i>.  Moreover, it turns out that we always have</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I%28q%2Cp%29+%5Cge+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="I(q,p) &#92;ge 0" class="latex" /></p>
<p>and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I%28q%2Cp%29+%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="I(q,p) = 0" class="latex" /> precisely when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p+%3D+q.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p = q." class="latex" /></p>
<p>People summarize all this by saying that relative information is a &#8216;Lyapunov function&#8217;.  Very roughly, a Lyapunov function is something that decreases with the passage of time, and is zero only at the unique stable state.   To be a bit more precise, suppose we have a differential equation like</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B++%5Cfrac%7Bd%7D%7Bd+t%7D+x%28t%29+%3D+v%28x%28t%29%29+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{  &#92;frac{d}{d t} x(t) = v(x(t)) } " class="latex" /></p>

<p>In this situation, the point <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x_0" class="latex" /> is a stable equilibrium for our differential equation: this is <b><a href="http://control.ee.ethz.ch/~ifalst/docs/lyapunov.pdf">Lyapunov&#8217;s theorem</a></b>.</p>
<h3> The replicator equation as a gradient flow equation </h3>
<p>The basic idea of Lyapunov&#8217;s theorem is that when a ball likes to roll downhill and the landscape has just one bottom point, that point will be the unique stable equilibrium for the ball.</p>
<p>The idea of gradient flow is similar, but different: sometimes things like to roll downhill <i>as efficiently as possible</i>: they move in the exactly the <i>best direction</i> to make some quantity smaller!  Under certain conditions, the replicator equation is an example of this phenomenon.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s fill in some details.  For starters, suppose we have some function</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F+%3A+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5En+%5Cto+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F : &#92;mathbb{R}^n &#92;to &#92;mathbb{R} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Think of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="V" class="latex" /> as &#8216;height&#8217;.  Then the <b>gradient flow equation</b> says how a point <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%28t%29+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5En&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x(t) &#92;in &#92;mathbb{R}^n" class="latex" /> will move if it&#8217;s always trying its very best to go downhill:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7Bd%7D%7Bd+t%7D+x%28t%29+%3D+-+%5Cnabla+V%28x%28t%29%29+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{d}{d t} x(t) = - &#92;nabla V(x(t)) } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Here <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;nabla" class="latex" /> is the usual gradient in Euclidean space:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cnabla+V+%3D+%5Cleft%28%5Cpartial_1+V%2C+%5Cdots%2C+%5Cpartial_n+V+%5Cright%29++%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;nabla V = &#92;left(&#92;partial_1 V, &#92;dots, &#92;partial_n V &#92;right)  } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpartial_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;partial_i" class="latex" /> is short for the partial derivative with respect to the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i" class="latex" />th coordinate.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is that under certain conditions, the replicator equation is an example of a gradient flow equation&#8230; but typically <i>not</i> one where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;nabla" class="latex" /> is the usual gradient in Euclidean space.  Instead, it&#8217;s the gradient on some other space, the space of all population distributions, which has a non-Euclidean geometry!</p>
<p>The space of all population distributions is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex">simplex</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B+p+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5En+%3A+%5C%3B+p_i+%5Cge+0%2C+%5C%3B+%5Csum_%7Bi+%3D+1%7D%5En+p_i+%3D+1+%5C%7D+.+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;{ p &#92;in &#92;mathbb{R}^n : &#92;; p_i &#92;ge 0, &#92;; &#92;sum_{i = 1}^n p_i = 1 &#92;} . " class="latex" /></p>
<p>For example, it&#8217;s an equilateral triangle when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%3D+3.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n = 3." class="latex" />  The equilateral triangle looks flat, but if we measure distances another way it becomes round, exactly like a portion of a sphere, and that&#8217;s the non-Euclidean geometry we need!</p>
<div align="center"><img width="400" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/harper/simplex_eighth-sphere.png" /></div>
<p>In fact this trick works in any dimension.  The idea is to give the simplex a special <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tensor">Riemannian metric</a>, the &#8216;Fisher information metric&#8217;.  The usual metric on Euclidean space is</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta_%7Bi+j%7D+%3D+%5Cleft%5C%7B%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Bccl%7D+1+%26+%5Cmathrm%7B+if+%7D+%26+i+%3D+j+%5C%5C+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++0+%26%5Cmathrm%7B+if+%7D+%26+i+%5Cne+j+%5Cend%7Barray%7D+%5Cright.+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;delta_{i j} = &#92;left&#92;{&#92;begin{array}{ccl} 1 &amp; &#92;mathrm{ if } &amp; i = j &#92;&#92;                                       0 &amp;&#92;mathrm{ if } &amp; i &#92;ne j &#92;end{array} &#92;right. " class="latex" /></p>
<p>This simply says that two standard basis vectors like <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%280%2C1%2C0%2C0%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(0,1,0,0)" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%280%2C0%2C1%2C0%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(0,0,1,0)" class="latex" /> have dot product zero if the 1&#8217;s are in different places, and one if they&#8217;re in the same place.  The <b>Fisher information metric</b> is a bit more complicated:</p>

<p>As before, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g_%7Bi+j%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="g_{i j}" class="latex" /> is a formula for the dot product of the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i" class="latex" />th and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="j" class="latex" />th standard basis vectors, but now it depends on where you are in the simplex of population distributions.</p>
<p>We saw how this formula arises from information theory back in <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/information/information_geometry_7.html">Part 7</a>.  I won&#8217;t repeat the calculation, but the idea is this.  Fix a population distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p" class="latex" /> and consider the information of another one, say <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="q," class="latex" /> relative to this.  We get <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I%28q%2Cp%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="I(q,p)." class="latex" />  If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q+%3D+p&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="q = p" class="latex" /> this is zero:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cleft.+I%28q%2Cp%29%5Cright%7C_%7Bq+%3D+p%7D+%3D+0+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;left. I(q,p)&#92;right|_{q = p} = 0 } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>and this point is a local minimum for the relative information. So, the first derivative of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I%28q%2Cp%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="I(q,p)" class="latex" /> as we change <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="q" class="latex" /> must be zero:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cleft.+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial%7D%7B%5Cpartial+q_i%7D+I%28q%2Cp%29+%5Cright%7C_%7Bq+%3D+p%7D+%3D+0+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;left. &#92;frac{&#92;partial}{&#92;partial q_i} I(q,p) &#92;right|_{q = p} = 0 } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>But the second derivatives are not zero. In fact, since we&#8217;re at a local minimum, it should not be surprising that we get a positive definite <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hessian_matrix">matrix of second derivatives</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B++g_%7Bi+j%7D+%3D+%5Cleft.+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial%5E2%7D%7B%5Cpartial+q_i+%5Cpartial+q_j%7D+I%28q%2Cp%29+%5Cright%7C_%7Bq+%3D+p%7D+%3D+0+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{  g_{i j} = &#92;left. &#92;frac{&#92;partial^2}{&#92;partial q_i &#92;partial q_j} I(q,p) &#92;right|_{q = p} = 0 } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>And, this is the Fisher information metric!  So, the Fisher information metric is a way of taking dot products between vectors in the simplex of population distribution that&#8217;s based on the concept of relative information.</p>
<p>This is not the place to explain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_geometry">Riemannian geometry</a>, but any metric gives a way to measure angles and distances, and thus a way to define the gradient of a function.  After all, the gradient of a function should point at right angles to the level sets of that function, and its length should equal the slope of that function:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://www.math.udel.edu/~driscoll/teaching/243/maple/Gradients.html"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/harper/gradient.gif" /></a>
</div>
<p>So, if we change our way of measuring angles and distances, we get a new concept of gradient!  The <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i" class="latex" />th component of this new gradient vector field turns out to b</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5Cnabla_g+V%29%5Ei+%3D+g%5E%7Bi+j%7D+%5Cpartial_j+V&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(&#92;nabla_g V)^i = g^{i j} &#92;partial_j V" class="latex" /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g%5E%7Bi+j%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="g^{i j}" class="latex" /> is the inverse of the matrix <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g_%7Bi+j%7D%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="g_{i j}," class="latex" /> and we sum over the repeated index <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="j." class="latex" />   As a sanity check, make sure you see why this is the usual Euclidean gradient when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g_%7Bi+j%7D+%3D+%5Cdelta_%7Bi+j%7D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="g_{i j} = &#92;delta_{i j}." class="latex" /></p>
<p>Now suppose the fitness landscape is the good old Euclidean gradient of some function.  Then it turns out that the replicator equation is a special case of gradient flow on the space of population distributions&#8230; but where we use the Fisher information metric to define our concept of gradient!</p>
<p>To get a feel for this, it&#8217;s good to start with the Lotka&ndash;Volterra equation, which describes how the total number of individuals of each type changes.  Suppose the fitness landscape is the Euclidean gradient of some function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="V" class="latex" />:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+f_i%28P%29+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+V%7D%7B%5Cpartial+P_i%7D+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ f_i(P) = &#92;frac{&#92;partial V}{&#92;partial P_i} } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Then the Lotka&ndash;Volterra equation becomes this:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7Bd+P_i%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+V%7D%7B%5Cpartial+P_i%7D+%5C%2C+P_i+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{d P_i}{d t} = &#92;frac{&#92;partial V}{&#92;partial P_i} &#92;, P_i } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t look like the gradient flow equation, thanks to that annoying <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="P_i" class="latex" /> on the right-hand side!  It certainly ain&#8217;t the gradient flow coming from the function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="V" class="latex" /> and the usual Euclidean gradient.  However, it <i>is</i> gradient flow coming from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="V" class="latex" /> and some <i>other</i> metric on the space</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B+P+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5En+%3A+%5C%3B+P_i+%5Cge+0+%5C%7D++&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;{ P &#92;in &#92;mathbb{R}^n : &#92;; P_i &#92;ge 0 &#92;}  " class="latex" /></p>
<p>For a proof, and the formula for this other metric, see Section 3.7 in this survey:</p>
<p>&bull; Marc Harper, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.1383">Information geometry and evolutionary game theory</a>.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s turn to the replicator equation:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7Bd+p_i%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D+%5Cleft%28+f_i%28p%29++-+%5Clangle+f%28p%29+%5Crangle+%5Cright%29+%5C%2C+p_i+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{d p_i}{d t} = &#92;left( f_i(p)  - &#92;langle f(p) &#92;rangle &#92;right) &#92;, p_i } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Again, if the fitness landscape is a Euclidean gradient, we can rewrite the replicator equation as a gradient flow equation&#8230; but again, not with respect to the Euclidean metric.  This time we need to use the Fisher information metric! I sketch a proof in my paper above.</p>
<p>In fact, both these results were first worked out by Shahshahani:</p>
<p>&bull; Siavash Shahshahani, <i>A New Mathematical Framework for the Study of Linkage and Selection</i>, <i>Memoirs of the AMS</i> <b>17</b>, 1979.</p>
<h3> New directions </h3>
<p>All this is just the beginning!  The ideas I just explained are unified in information geometry, where distance-like quantities such as the relative entropy and the Fisher information metric are studied.  From here it&#8217;s a short walk to a very nice version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%27s_fundamental_theorem_of_natural_selection">Fisher&#8217;s fundamental theorem of natural selection</a>, which is familiar to researchers both in evolutionary dynamics and in information geometry.</p>
<p>You can see some very nice versions of this story for maximum likelihood estimators and linear programming here:</p>
<p>&bull; Akio Fujiwara and Shun-ichi Amari, Gradient systems in view of information geometry, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016727899400175P"><i>Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena</i></a> <b>80</b> (1995), 317&ndash;327.</p>
<p>Indeed, this seems to be the first paper discussing the similarities between evolutionary game theory and information geometry.</p>
<p>Dash Fryer (at Pomona College) and I have generalized this story in several interesting ways.</p>
<p>First, there are two famous ways to generalize the usual formula for entropy: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsallis_entropy">Tsallis entropy</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9nyi_entropy">R&eacute;nyi entropy</a>, both of which involve a parameter <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="q." class="latex" />  There are Tsallis and R&eacute;nyi versions of relative entropy and the Fisher information metric as well.  Everything I just explained about:</p>
<p>&bull; conditions under which relative entropy is a Lyapunov function for the replicator equation, and</p>
<p>&bull; conditions under which the replicator equation is a special case of gradient flow</p>
<p>generalize to these cases!  However, these generalized entropies give modified versions of the replicator equation.  When we set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q%3D1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="q=1" class="latex" /> we get back the usual story.  See</p>
<p>&bull; Marc Harper, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.1764">Escort evolutionary game theory</a>.</p>
<p>My initial interest in these alternate entropies was mostly mathematical&#8212;what is so special about the corresponding geometries?&#8212;but now researchers are starting to find populations that evolve according to these kinds of modified population dynamics!  For example:</p>
<p>&bull; A. Hernando <i>et al</i>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.0905">The workings of the Maximum Entropy Principle in collective human behavior</a>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s an interesting special case worth some attention. Lots of people fret about the relative entropy not being a distance function obeying the axioms that mathematicians like: for example, it doesn&#8217;t obey the triangle inequality.   Many describe the relative entropy as a <i>distance-like</i> function, and this is often a valid interpretation contextually.  On the other hand, the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q%3D0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="q=0" class="latex" /> relative entropy is one-half the Euclidean distance squared!  In this case the modified version of the replicator equation looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7Bd+p_i%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D+f_i%28p%29+-+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%7D+%5Csum_%7Bj+%3D+1%7D%5En+f_j%28p%29+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{d p_i}{d t} = f_i(p) - &#92;frac{1}{n} &#92;sum_{j = 1}^n f_j(p) } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>This equation is called the <b>projection dynamic</b>.</p>
<p>Later, I showed that there is a reasonable definition of relative entropy for a much larger family of geometries that satisfies a similar <i>distance minimization</i> property.</p>
<p>In a different direction, Dash showed that you can change the way that selection acts by using a variety of alternative ‘incentives’, extending the story to some other well-known equations describing evolutionary dynamics. By replacing the terms <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_i+f_i%28x%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x_i f_i(x)" class="latex" /> in the replicator equation with a variety of other functions, called <b>incentives</b>, we can generate many commonly studied models of evolutionary dynamics. For instance if we exponentiate the fitness landscape (to make it always positive), we get what is commonly known as the <b>logit dynamic</b>.  This amounts to changing the fitness landscape as follows:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+f_i+%5Cmapsto+%5Cfrac%7Bx_i+e%5E%7B%5Cbeta+f_i%7D%7D%7B%5Csum_j%7Bx_j+e%5E%7B%5Cbeta+f_j%7D%7D%7D+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ f_i &#92;mapsto &#92;frac{x_i e^{&#92;beta f_i}}{&#92;sum_j{x_j e^{&#92;beta f_j}}} } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta" class="latex" /> is known as an <b>inverse temperature</b> in statistical thermodynamics and as an <b>intensity of selection</b> in evolutionary dynamics. There are lots of modified versions of the replicator equation, like the best-reply and projection dynamics, more common in economic applications of evolutionary game theory, and they can all be captured in this family. (There are also other ways to simultaneously capture such families, such as Bill Sandholm&#8217;s revision protocols, which were introduced earlier in his exploration of the foundations of game dynamics.)</p>
<p>Dash showed that there is a natural generalization of evolutionarily stable states to &#8216;incentive stable states&#8217;, and that for incentive stable states, the relative entropy is decreasing to zero when the trajectories get near the equilibrium. For the logit and projection dynamics, incentive stable states are simply evolutionarily stable states, and this happens frequently, but not always.</p>
<p>The third generalization is to look at different &#8216;time-scales&#8217;&#8212;that is, different ways of describing time!  We can make up the symbol <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BT%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{T}" class="latex" /> for a general choice of &#8216;time-scale&#8217;.  So far I&#8217;ve been treating time as a real number, so</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BT%7D+%3D+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{T} = &#92;mathbb{R} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>But we can also treat time as coming in discrete evenly spaced steps, which amounts to treating time as an integer:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BT%7D+%3D+%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{T} = &#92;mathbb{Z} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>More generally, we can make the steps have duration <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="h," class="latex" /> where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="h" class="latex" /> is any positive real number:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BT%7D+%3D+h%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{T} = h&#92;mathbb{Z} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>There is a nice way to simultaneously describe the cases <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BT%7D+%3D+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{T} = &#92;mathbb{R}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BT%7D+%3D+h%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{T} = h&#92;mathbb{Z}" class="latex" /> using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-scale_calculus">time-scale calculus</a> and time-scale derivatives. For the time-scale <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BT%7D+%3D+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{T} = &#92;mathbb{R}" class="latex" /> the time-scale derivative is just the ordinary derivative. For the time-scale <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BT%7D+%3D+h%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{T} = h&#92;mathbb{Z}," class="latex" /> the time-scale derivative is given by the difference quotient from first year calculus:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+f%5E%7B%5CDelta%7D%28z%29+%3D+%5Cfrac%7Bf%28z%2Bh%29+-+f%28z%29%7D%7Bh%7D+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ f^{&#92;Delta}(z) = &#92;frac{f(z+h) - f(z)}{h} } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>and using this as a substitute for the derivative gives difference equations like a discrete-time version of the replicator equation.  There are many other choices of time-scale, such as the <b>quantum time-scale</b> given by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BT%7D+%3D+q%5E%7B%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D%7D%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{T} = q^{&#92;mathbb{Z}}," class="latex" /> in which case the time-scale derivative is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-derivative"><i>q</i>-derivative</a>, but that&#8217;s a tale for another time.  In any case, the fact that the successive relative entropies are decreasing can be simply state by saying they have negative <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BT%7D+%3D+h%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{T} = h&#92;mathbb{Z}" class="latex" /> time-scale derivative.   The continuous case we started with corresponds to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BT%7D+%3D+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{T} = &#92;mathbb{R}." class="latex" /></p>
<p>Remarkably, Dash and I were able to show that you can combine all three of these generalizations into one theorem, and even allow for multiple interacting populations! This produces some really neat population trajectories, such as the following two populations with three types, with fitness functions corresponding to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors#Rock-paper-scissors_analogies_in_nature">rock-paper-scissors game</a>. On top we have the replicator equation, which goes along with the Fisher information metric; on the bottom we have the logit dynamic, which goes along with the Euclidean metric on the simplex:</p>
<div align="center">

<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/harper/figure_8_2.png" width="300" />
</div>
<p>From our theorem, it follows that the relative entropy (ordinary relative entropy on top, the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q+%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="q = 0" class="latex" /> entropy on bottom) converges to zero along the population trajectories.</p>
<p>The final form of the theorem is loosely as follows. Pick a Riemannian geometry given by a metric <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="g" class="latex" /> (obeying some mild conditions) and an incentive for each population, as well as a time scale (<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}" class="latex" /> or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h+%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="h &#92;mathbb{Z}" class="latex" />) for every population. This gives an evolutionary dynamic with a natural generalization of evolutionarily stable states, and a suitable version of the relative entropy.   Then, if there is an evolutionarily stable state in the interior of the simplex, the time-scale derivative of sum of the relative entropies for each population will decrease as the trajectories converge to the stable state!</p>
<p>When there isn&#8217;t such a stable state, we still get some interesting population dynamics, like the following:</p>

<p>Next time we&#8217;ll see how to make the main idea work in finite populations, without derivatives or deterministic trajectories!</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Today at the CQT, <a href="http://physics.usc.edu/Faculty/Zanardi/">Paolo Zanardi</a> from the University of Southern California is giving a talk on &#8220;Quantum Fidelity and the Geometry of Quantum Criticality&#8221;.  Here are my rough notes&#8230;</p>
<p>The motto from the early days of quantum information theory was &#8220;Information is physical.&#8221;  You need to care about the physical medium in which information is encoded.  But we can also turn it around: &#8220;Physics is informational&#8221;.</p>
<p>In a &#8220;classical phase transition&#8221;, thermal fluctuations play a crucial role.  At zero temperature these go away, but there can still be different phases depending on other parameters.  A transition between phases at zero temperature is called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_phase_transition">quantum phase transitions</a>.  One way to detect a quantum phase transition is simply to notice that ground state depends very sensitively on the parameters near such a point.  We can do this mathematically using a precise way of measuring distances between states: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fubini%E2%80%93Study_metric">Fubini-Study metric</a>, which I&#8217;ll define below.</p>
<p>Suppose that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="M" class="latex" /> is a manifold parametrizing Hamiltonians for a quantum system, so each point <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%5Cin+M&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x &#92;in M" class="latex" /> gives a self-adjoint operator <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H%28x%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="H(x)" class="latex" /> on some finite-dimensional Hilbert space, say <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BC%7D%5En&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{C}^n" class="latex" />.   Of course in the thermodynamic limit (the limit of infinite volume) we expect our quantum system to be described by an <i>infinite-dimensional</i> Hilbert space, but let&#8217;s start out with a finite-dimensional one.   </p>
<p>Furthermore, let&#8217;s suppose each Hamiltonian has a unique ground state, or at least a chosen ground state, say <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpsi%28x%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;psi(x)" class="latex" />.  Here <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> does <i>not</i> indicate a point in space: it&#8217;s a point in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="M" class="latex" />, our space of Hamiltonians!  </p>
<p>This ground state <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpsi%28x%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;psi(x)" class="latex" /> is really defined only up to phase, so we should think of it as giving an element of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_Hilbert_space">projective space</a> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BC+P%7D%5E%7Bn-1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{C P}^{n-1}" class="latex" />.  There&#8217;s a god-given metric on projective space, called the Fubini-Study metric.  Since we have a map from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="M" class="latex" /> to projective space, sending each point <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> to the state <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpsi%28x%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;psi(x)" class="latex" /> (modulo phase), we can pull back the Fubini-Study metric via this map to get a metric on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="M" class="latex" />.  </p>
<p>But, the resulting metric <i>may not be smooth</i>, because <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpsi%28x%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;psi(x)" class="latex" /> may not depend smoothly on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" />.  The metric may have singularities at certain points, especially after we take the thermodynamic limit.   We can think of these singular points as being &#8216;phase transitions&#8217;.  </p>
<p>If what I said in the last two paragraphs makes no sense, perhaps a version in something more like plain English will be more useful.   We&#8217;ve got a quantum system depending on some parameters, and there may be points where the ground state of this quantum system depends in a very drastic way on slight changes in the parameters.  </p>
<p>But we can also make the math a bit more explicit.  What&#8217;s the Fubini-Study metric?  Given two unit vectors in a Hilbert space, say <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpsi&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;psi" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpsi%27&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;psi&#039;" class="latex" />, their <b>Fubini-Study distance</b>  is just the angle between them:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d%28%5Cpsi%2C+%5Cpsi%27%29+%3D+%5Ccos%5E%7B-1%7D%7C%5Clangle+%5Cpsi%2C+%5Cpsi%27+%5Crangle%7C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="d(&#92;psi, &#92;psi&#039;) = &#92;cos^{-1}|&#92;langle &#92;psi, &#92;psi&#039; &#92;rangle|" class="latex" /></p>
<p>This is an honest Riemannian metric on the projective version of the Hilbert space.  And in case you&#8217;re wondering about the term &#8216;quantum fidelity&#8217; in the title of Zanardi&#8217;s talk, the quantity</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7C%5Clangle+%5Cpsi%2C+%5Cpsi%27+%5Crangle%7C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="|&#92;langle &#92;psi, &#92;psi&#039; &#92;rangle|" class="latex" /></p>
<p>is called the <b>fidelity</b>.  The fidelity ranges between 0 and 1, and it&#8217;s 1 when two unit vectors are the same up to a phase.   To convert this into a distance we take the arc-cosine.</p>
<p>When we pull the Fubini-Study metric back to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="M" class="latex" />, we get a Riemannian metric away from the singular points, and in local coordinates this metric is given by the following cool formula:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g_%7B%5Cmu+%5Cnu%7D+%3D+%7B%5Crm+Re%7D%5Cleft%28%5Clangle+%5Cpartial_%5Cmu+%5Cpsi%2C+%5Cpartial_%5Cnu+%5Cpsi+%5Crangle+-+%5Clangle+%5Cpartial_%5Cmu+%5Cpsi%2C+%5Cpsi+%5Crangle+%5Clangle+%5Cpsi%2C+%5Cpartial_%5Cnu+%5Cpsi+%5Crangle+%5Cright%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="g_{&#92;mu &#92;nu} = {&#92;rm Re}&#92;left(&#92;langle &#92;partial_&#92;mu &#92;psi, &#92;partial_&#92;nu &#92;psi &#92;rangle - &#92;langle &#92;partial_&#92;mu &#92;psi, &#92;psi &#92;rangle &#92;langle &#92;psi, &#92;partial_&#92;nu &#92;psi &#92;rangle &#92;right) " class="latex" /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpartial_%5Cmu+%5Cpsi&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;partial_&#92;mu &#92;psi" class="latex" /> is the derivative of the ground state <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpsi%28x%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;psi(x)" class="latex" /> as we move <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> in the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mu" class="latex" />th coordinate direction.  </p>
<p>But Michael Berry came up with an even cooler formula for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g_%7B%5Cmu+%5Cnu%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="g_{&#92;mu &#92;nu}" class="latex" />.  Let&#8217;s call the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpsi_n%28x%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;psi_n(x)" class="latex" />, so that</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H%28x%29+%5Cpsi_n%28x%29+%3D+E_n%28x%29+%5C%2C+%5Cpsi_n%28x%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="H(x) &#92;psi_n(x) = E_n(x) &#92;, &#92;psi_n(x) " class="latex" /></p>
<p>And let&#8217;s rename the ground state <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpsi_0%28x%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;psi_0(x)" class="latex" />, so</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpsi%28x%29+%3D+%5Cpsi_0%28x%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;psi(x) = &#92;psi_0(x)" class="latex" /></p>
<p>and </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H%28x%29+%5Cpsi_0%28x%29+%3D+E_0%28x%29+%5C%2C+%5Cpsi_0%28x%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="H(x) &#92;psi_0(x) = E_0(x) &#92;, &#92;psi_0(x) " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Then a calculation familiar to those you&#8217;d see in first-order perturbation theory shows that</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g_%7B%5Cmu+%5Cnu%7D+%3D+%7B%5Crm+Re%7D+%5Csum_n+%5Clangle+%5Cpsi_0+%2C+%5Cpartial_%5Cmu+H+%5C%3B+%5Cpsi_n+%5Crangle+%5Clangle+%5Cpartial_%5Cnu+H+%5C%3B+%5Cpsi_n%2C+%5Cpsi_0+%5Crangle+%2F+%28E_n+-+E_0%29%5E2+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="g_{&#92;mu &#92;nu} = {&#92;rm Re} &#92;sum_n &#92;langle &#92;psi_0 , &#92;partial_&#92;mu H &#92;; &#92;psi_n &#92;rangle &#92;langle &#92;partial_&#92;nu H &#92;; &#92;psi_n, &#92;psi_0 &#92;rangle / (E_n - E_0)^2 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>This is nice because it shows <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g_%7B%5Cmu+%5Cnu%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="g_{&#92;mu &#92;nu}" class="latex" /> is likely to become singular at points where the ground state becomes degenerate, i.e. where two different states both have minimal energy, so some difference <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E_n+-+E_0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="E_n - E_0" class="latex" /> becomes zero.</p>
<p>To illustrate these ideas, Zanardi did an example: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_model">XY model</a> in an external magnetic field.  This is a &#8216;spin chain&#8217;: a bunch of spin-1/2 particles in a row, each interacting with their nearest neighbors.  So, for a chain of length <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="L" class="latex" />, the Hilbert space is a tensor product of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="L" class="latex" /> copies of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BC%7D%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{C}^2" class="latex" />:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BC%7D%5E2+%5Cotimes+%5Ccdots+%5Cotimes+%5Cmathbb%7BC%7D%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{C}^2 &#92;otimes &#92;cdots &#92;otimes &#92;mathbb{C}^2" class="latex" /></p>
<p>The Hamiltonian of the XY model depends on two real parameters <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;lambda" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;gamma" class="latex" />.  The parameter <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;lambda" class="latex" /> describes a magnetic field pointing in the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="z" class="latex" /> direction:</p>

<p>where the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csigma&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;sigma" class="latex" />&#8216;s are the ever-popular Pauli matrices.  The first term makes the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> components of the spins of neighboring particles want to point in opposite directions when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;gamma" class="latex" /> is big.  The second term makes <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y" class="latex" /> components of neighboring spins want to point in the same direction when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;gamma" class="latex" /> is big.  And the third term makes all the spins want to point up (resp. down) in the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="z" class="latex" /> direction when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;lambda" class="latex" /> is big and negative (resp. positive).</p>
<p>What&#8217;s our poor spin chain to do, faced with such competing directives?  At zero temperature it seeks the state of lowest energy. When <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;lambda" class="latex" /> is less than -1 all the spins get polarized in the spin-up state; when it&#8217;s bigger than 1 they all get polarized in the spin-down state.  For <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;lambda" class="latex" /> in between, there is also some sort of phase transition at <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma+%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;gamma = 0" class="latex" />.  What&#8217;s this like?  Some sort of transition between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic?</p>
<p>We can use a transformation to express this as a fermionic system and solve it exactly.  Physicists love exactly solvable systems, so there have been thousands of papers about the XY model.  In the thermodynamic limit (<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L+%5Cto+%2B%5Cinfty&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="L &#92;to +&#92;infty" class="latex" />) the ground state can be computed explicitly, so we can explicitly work out the metric <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="d" class="latex" /> on the parameter space that has <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda%2C+%5Cgamma&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;lambda, &#92;gamma" class="latex" /> as coordinates!</p>
<p>I will not give the formulas &mdash; Zanardi did, but they&#8217;re too scary for me.  I&#8217;ll skip straight to the punchline.  Away from phase transitions, we see that for nearby values of parameters, say </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%3D+%28%5Cgamma%2C+%5Cdelta%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x = (&#92;gamma, &#92;delta)" class="latex" /> </p>
<p>and </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%27+%3D+%28%5Cgamma%27%2C+%5Cdelta%27%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x&#039; = (&#92;gamma&#039;, &#92;delta&#039;)" class="latex" /></p>
<p>the ground states have</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7C%5Clangle+%5Cpsi%28x%29%2C+%5Cpsi%28x%27%29+%5Crangle%7C+%5Csim+%5Cexp%28-c+L%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="|&#92;langle &#92;psi(x), &#92;psi(x&#039;) &#92;rangle| &#92;sim &#92;exp(-c L) " class="latex" /></p>
<p>for some constant <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c" class="latex" />.  That&#8217;s not surprising: even though the two ground states are locally very similar, since we have a total of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="L" class="latex" /> spins in our spin chain, the overall inner product goes like <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cexp%28-c+L%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;exp(-c L)" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>But at phase transitions, the inner product <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7C%5Clangle+%5Cpsi%28x%29%2C+%5Cpsi%28x%27%29+%5Crangle%7C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="|&#92;langle &#92;psi(x), &#92;psi(x&#039;) &#92;rangle|" class="latex" /> decays even faster with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="L" class="latex" />: </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7C%5Clangle+%5Cpsi%28x%29%2C+%5Cpsi%28x%27%29+%5Crangle%7C+%5Csim+%5Cexp%28-c%27+L%5E2%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="|&#92;langle &#92;psi(x), &#92;psi(x&#039;) &#92;rangle| &#92;sim &#92;exp(-c&#039; L^2) " class="latex" /></p>
<p>for some other constant <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%27&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c&#039;" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>This is called <b>enhanced orthogonalization</b> since it means the ground states at slightly different values of our parameters get close to orthogonal <i>even faster</i> as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="L" class="latex" /> grows.  Or in other words: their distance as measured by the metric <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g_%7B%5Cmu+%5Cnu%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="g_{&#92;mu &#92;nu}" class="latex" /> <i>grows</i> even faster.</p>
<p>This sort of phase transition is an example of a &#8220;quantum phase transition&#8221;.  Note: we&#8217;re detecting this phase transition not by looking at the ground state expectation value of a given observable, but by how the ground state <i>itself</i> changes drastically as we change the parameters governing the Hamiltonian.</p>
<p>The exponent of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="L" class="latex" /> here &mdash; namely the 2 in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="L^2" class="latex" /> &mdash; is &#8216;universal&#8217;: i.e., it&#8217;s robust with respect to changes in the parameters and even the detailed form of the Hamiltonian.</p>
<p>Zanardi concluded with an argument showing that not every quantum phase transition can be detected by enhanced orthogonalization.   For more details, try:</p>

<p>As a final little footnote, I should add that Paolo Zanardi said the metric <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g_%7B%5Cmu+%5Cnu%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="g_{&#92;mu &#92;nu}" class="latex" /> defined as above was analogous to <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/corfield/2006/08/ruminating.html">Fisher information metric</a>.

					<p>Biden&#8217;s executive orders are now going beyond revoking those of the previous president.   He may really take climate change seriously.  It&#8217;s starting to scare some people.</p>
<p>&bull; Juliet Eilperin and Brady Dennis, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/01/27/biden-climate-change/">As Biden vows monumental action on climate change, a fight with the fossil fuel industry has only begun</a>, <i>Washington Post</i>, 27 January 2021.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Joe Biden had long promised to become the climate president, and on Wednesday he detailed far-ranging plans to shift the U.S. away from fossil fuels, create millions of jobs in renewable energy, and conserve vast swaths of public lands and water.</p>
<p>“This is not a time for small measures,” Biden said at the White House, adding that the nation had already wasted precious years as it delayed in dealing with the climate crisis.</p>
<p>But as he detailed his plans, the gas, oil and coal industries were already mobilizing on all fronts. From an oil patch in Alaska to state capitals to the halls of Congress, the industries and their allies are aiming to slow Biden’s unprecedented push for climate action and keep profits from fossil fuels flowing. Republican attorneys general from six states wrote to the new president, warning him not to overstep his authority. GOP lawmakers attacked his executive orders as “job killers.” And the petroleum industry revived television ads promoting drilling on federal lands.</p>
<p>Industry executives expressed dismay at the scope, speed and direction in which Biden is heading, saying he is going much further than President Barack Obama ever did, while environmentalists said the danger that Earth faces is far more dire now than it appeared during Obama’s tenure and requires an extraordinary response. Last year essentially tied with 2016 as the hottest year ever recorded, and scientists say the planet is speeding toward irreversible damage.</p>
<p>In barely a week in office, Biden has moved to rejoin the Paris climate accord, halt the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, impose new limits on oil and gas production, and mandate climate change as a priority across every federal agency.</p></blockquote>
<p>This article spells out the forthcoming battle in a bit more detail:</p>
<p>&bull; Coral Davenport and Lisa Friedman, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/26/climate/biden-climate-change.html">The battle lines are forming in Biden’s climate push</a>, <i>New York Times</i>, 26 January, 2020.</p>
<blockquote><p>
As President Biden prepares on Wednesday to open an ambitious effort to confront climate change, powerful and surprising forces are arrayed at his back.</p>
<p>Automakers are coming to accept that much higher fuel economy standards are their future; large oil and gas companies have said some curbs on greenhouse pollution lifted by former President Donald J. Trump should be reimposed; shareholders are demanding corporations acknowledge and prepare for a warmer, more volatile future, and a youth movement is driving the Democratic Party to go big to confront the issue.</p>
<p>But what may well stand in the president’s way is political intransigence from senators from fossil-fuel states in both parties. An evenly divided Senate has given enormous power to any single senator, and one in particular, Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, who will lead the Senate Energy Committee and who came to the Senate as a defender of his state’s coal industry.

<p><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/executive-order-on-tackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad/">Today&#8217;s executive order</a> raises the stakes:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Executive order on Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad</h3>
<p>The United States and the world face a profound climate crisis.&nbsp; We have a narrow moment to pursue action at home and abroad in order to avoid the most catastrophic impacts of that crisis and to seize the opportunity that tackling climate change&nbsp;presents.&nbsp; Domestic action must go hand in hand&nbsp;with United States international leadership, aimed at significantly enhancing global action.&nbsp; Together, we must listen&nbsp;to science and meet the moment.</p>
<p>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p>PART I &#8212; PUTTING THE CLIMATE CRISIS AT THE CENTER OF UNITED&nbsp;STATES FOREIGN POLICY AND NATIONAL SECURITY</p>
<p>Section 101.&nbsp; Policy.&nbsp; United States international engagement to address climate change &#8212; which has become a&nbsp;climate crisis &#8212; is more necessary and urgent than ever.&nbsp; The&nbsp;scientific community has made clear that the scale and speed of necessary action is greater than previously believed.&nbsp; There is little time left to avoid setting the world on a dangerous, potentially catastrophic, climate trajectory.&nbsp; Responding to the climate crisis will require both significant short-term global reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and net-zero global emissions by mid-century or before.</p>
<p>It is the policy of my Administration that climate considerations shall be an essential element of United States foreign policy and national security.&nbsp; The United States will work with other countries and partners, both bilaterally and multilaterally, to put the world on a sustainable climate pathway.&nbsp; The United States will also move quickly to build resilience, both at home and abroad, against the impacts of climate change that are already manifest and will continue to&nbsp;intensify according to current trajectories.</p>
<p>Sec. 102.&nbsp; Purpose.&nbsp; This order builds on and reaffirms actions my Administration has already taken to place the climate crisis at the forefront of this Nation&#8217;s foreign policy and national security planning, including submitting the United States instrument of acceptance to rejoin the Paris Agreement.&nbsp; In implementing &#8212; and building upon &#8212; the Paris Agreement&#8217;s three overarching objectives (a safe global temperature, increased climate resilience, and financial flows aligned with&nbsp;a&nbsp;pathway toward low greenhouse gas emissions and climate‑resilient development), the United States will exercise its leadership to promote a significant increase in global climate ambition to meet the climate challenge.&nbsp; In this regard:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp; I will host an early Leaders&#8217; Climate Summit aimed at raising climate ambition and making a positive contribution to the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) and beyond.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp; The United States will reconvene the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate, beginning with the Leaders&#8217; Climate Summit.&nbsp; In cooperation with the members of that Forum, as well&nbsp;as with other partners as appropriate, the United States will pursue green recovery efforts, initiatives to advance the&nbsp;clean energy transition, sectoral decarbonization, and alignment of financial flows with the objectives of the Paris Agreement, including with respect to coal financing, nature-based solutions, and solutions to other climate-related challenges.</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp; I have created a new Presidentially appointed position, the Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, to elevate the issue of climate change and underscore the commitment my Administration will make toward addressing it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp; Recognizing that climate change affects a wide range of subjects, it will be a United States priority to press for&nbsp;enhanced climate ambition and integration of climate considerations across a wide range of international fora, including the Group of Seven (G7), the Group of Twenty (G20), and fora that address clean energy, aviation, shipping, the Arctic, the ocean, sustainable development, migration, and other relevant topics.&nbsp; The Special Presidential Envoy for Climate and others, as appropriate, are encouraged to promote innovative approaches, including international multi-stakeholder initiatives.&nbsp; In addition, my Administration will work in partnership with States, localities, Tribes, territories, and other United States stakeholders to advance United States climate diplomacy.</p>
<p>(e)&nbsp; The United States will immediately begin the process of developing its nationally determined contribution under the Paris Agreement.&nbsp; The process will include analysis and input from relevant executive departments and agencies (agencies), as well as appropriate outreach to domestic stakeholders.&nbsp; The United States will aim to submit its nationally determined contribution in advance of the Leaders&#8217; Climate Summit.</p>
<p>(f)&nbsp; The United States will also immediately begin to develop a climate finance plan, making strategic use of multilateral and bilateral channels and institutions, to assist developing countries in implementing ambitious emissions reduction measures, protecting critical ecosystems, building resilience against the impacts of climate change, and promoting the flow of capital toward climate-aligned investments and away from high-carbon investments.&nbsp; The Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury, in coordination with the Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, shall lead a process to develop this plan, with the participation of the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Chief Executive Officer of the United States International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), the Chief Executive Officer of the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the Director of the United States Trade and Development Agency, the Director of the Office of Management and&nbsp;Budget, and the head of any other agency providing foreign assistance and development financing, as appropriate.&nbsp; The Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury shall submit the plan to the President, through the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, within 90 days of the date of this order.</p>
<p>(g)&nbsp; The Secretary of the Treasury shall:</p>
<p>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ensure that the United States is present and&nbsp;engaged in relevant international fora and institutions that are working on the management of&nbsp;climate-related financial risks;</p>
<p>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp; develop a strategy for how the voice and vote of the United States can be used in international financial institutions, including the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund, to promote financing programs, economic stimulus packages, and debt relief initiatives that are aligned with and support the goals of the Paris Agreement; and</p>
<p>(iii)&nbsp; develop, in collaboration with the Secretary of&nbsp;State, the Administrator of USAID, and the Chief Executive Officer of the DFC, a plan for promoting the protection of the Amazon rainforest and other critical ecosystems that serve as global carbon sinks, including through market-based mechanisms.</p>
<p>(h)&nbsp; The Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Secretary of Energy shall work together and with the Export–Import Bank of the United States, the Chief Executive Officer of the DFC, and the heads of other agencies and partners, as appropriate, to identify steps through which the United States can promote ending international financing of carbon-intensive fossil fuel-based energy while simultaneously advancing sustainable development and a green recovery, in consultation with the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs.</p>
<p>(i)&nbsp; The Secretary of Energy, in cooperation with the Secretary of State and the heads of other agencies, as appropriate, shall identify steps through which the United States can intensify international collaborations to drive innovation and deployment of clean energy technologies, which are critical for climate protection.</p>
<p>(j)&nbsp; The Secretary of State shall prepare, within 60 days of the date of this order, a transmittal package seeking the Senate&#8217;s advice and consent to ratification of the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, regarding the phasedown of the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons.</p>
<p>Sec. 103.&nbsp; Prioritizing Climate in Foreign Policy and National Security.&nbsp; To ensure that climate change considerations are central to United States foreign policy and national security:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp; Agencies that engage in extensive international work shall develop, in coordination with the Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, and submit to the President, through the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, within 90 days of the date of this order, strategies and implementation plans for integrating climate considerations into their international work, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law.&nbsp; These strategies and plans should include an&nbsp;assessment of:</p>
<p>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; climate impacts relevant to broad agency strategies in particular countries or regions;</p>
<p>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp; climate impacts on their agency-managed infrastructure abroad (e.g., embassies, military installations), without prejudice to existing requirements regarding assessment of such infrastructure;</p>
<p>(iii)&nbsp; how the agency intends to manage such impacts or incorporate risk mitigation into its installation master plans; and</p>
<p>(iv)&nbsp; &nbsp;how the agency&#8217;s international work, including partner engagement, can contribute to addressing the climate crisis.</p>

<p>PART II &#8212; TAKING A GOVERNMENT-WIDE APPROACH TO THE CLIMATE CRISIS</p>
<p>Sec. 201. &nbsp;Policy. &nbsp;Even as our Nation emerges from profound public health and economic crises borne of a pandemic, we face a climate crisis that threatens our people and communities, public health and economy, and, starkly, our ability to live on planet Earth. &nbsp;Despite the peril that is already evident, there is promise in the solutions &#8212; opportunities to create well-paying union jobs to build a modern and sustainable infrastructure, deliver an equitable, clean energy future, and put the United States on a path to achieve net-zero emissions, economy-wide, by no later than 2050.</p>
<p>We must listen to science &#8212; and act. &nbsp;We must strengthen our&nbsp;clean air and water protections. &nbsp;We must hold polluters accountable for their actions. &nbsp;We must deliver environmental justice in communities all across America. &nbsp;The Federal Government must drive assessment, disclosure, and mitigation of&nbsp;climate pollution and climate-related risks in every sector of our economy, marshaling the creativity, courage, and capital necessary to make our Nation resilient in the face of this threat.&nbsp; Together, we must combat the climate crisis with bold,&nbsp;progressive action that combines the full capacity of the&nbsp;Federal Government with efforts from every corner of our Nation, every level of government, and every sector of our economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is the policy of my Administration to organize and deploy the full capacity of its agencies to combat the climate crisis to implement a Government-wide approach that reduces climate pollution in every sector of the economy; increases resilience to the impacts of climate change; protects public health; conserves our lands, waters, and biodiversity; delivers environmental justice; and spurs well-paying union jobs and economic growth, especially through innovation, commercialization, and deployment of clean energy technologies and infrastructure. &nbsp;Successfully meeting these challenges will require the Federal Government to pursue such a coordinated approach from planning to implementation, coupled with substantive engagement by stakeholders, including State, local,&nbsp;and Tribal governments.</p>

<p>(b)&nbsp; Within 30 days of an agency&#8217;s submission of an action plan, the Federal Chief Sustainability Officer, in coordination with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, shall review the plan to assess its consistency with the policy set forth in section 204 of this order and the priorities issued by the Office of Management and Budget.</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp; After submitting an initial action plan, the head of each agency shall submit to the Task Force and Federal Chief Sustainability Officer progress reports annually on the status of implementation efforts. &nbsp;Agencies shall make progress reports public and post them on the agency website, to the extent consistent with applicable law. &nbsp;The heads of agencies shall assign their respective agency Chief Sustainability Officer the authority to perform duties relating to implementation of this order within the agency, to the extent consistent with applicable law.</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp; To assist agencies and State, local, Tribal, and territorial governments, communities, and businesses in preparing for and adapting to the impacts of climate change, the&nbsp;Secretary of Commerce, through the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Secretary of Homeland Security, through the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, in coordination with the heads of other agencies, as appropriate, shall provide to the Task Force a report on ways to expand and improve climate forecast capabilities and information products for the public. &nbsp;In addition, the Secretary of the Interior and the Deputy Director for Management of the Office of Management and Budget, in their capacities as the Chair and Vice-Chair of the Federal Geographic Data Committee, shall assess and provide to the Task Force a report on the potential development of a consolidated Federal geographic mapping service that can facilitate public access to climate-related information that will assist Federal, State, local, and Tribal governments in climate planning and resilience activities.</p>
<p>EMPOWERING WORKERS THROUGH REBUILDING OUR INFRASTRUCTURE FOR A&nbsp;SUSTAINABLE ECONOMY</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Sec. 212. &nbsp;Policy.&nbsp; This Nation needs millions of construction, manufacturing, engineering, and skilled-trades workers to build a new American infrastructure and clean energy economy. &nbsp;These jobs will create opportunities for young people and for older workers shifting to new professions, and for people from all backgrounds and communities. &nbsp;Such jobs will bring opportunity to communities too often left behind &#8212; places that have suffered as a result of economic shifts and places that have suffered the most from persistent pollution, including low-income rural and urban communities, communities of color, and Native communities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sec. 213. &nbsp;Sustainable Infrastructure. &nbsp;(a)&nbsp; The Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall take steps, consistent with applicable law, to ensure that Federal infrastructure investment reduces climate pollution, and to require that Federal permitting decisions consider the effects of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change.&nbsp; In addition, they shall review, and report to the National Climate Advisor on, siting and permitting processes, including those in progress under the auspices of the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council, and identify steps that can be taken, consistent with applicable law, to accelerate the deployment of clean energy and transmission projects in an environmentally stable manner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp; Agency heads conducting infrastructure reviews shall, as appropriate, consult from an early stage with State, local, and Tribal officials involved in permitting or authorizing proposed infrastructure projects to develop efficient timelines for decision-making that are appropriate given the complexities of proposed projects.</p>
<p>EMPOWERING WORKERS BY ADVANCING CONSERVATION, AGRICULTURE, AND REFORESTATION</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Sec. 214. &nbsp;Policy. &nbsp;It is the policy of my Administration to put a new generation of Americans to work conserving our public lands and waters. &nbsp;The Federal Government must protect America&#8217;s natural treasures, increase reforestation, improve access to recreation, and increase resilience to wildfires and&nbsp;storms, while creating well-paying union jobs for more Americans, including more opportunities for women and people of color in occupations where they are underrepresented.&nbsp; America&#8217;s farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners have an important role to play in combating the climate crisis and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, by sequestering carbon in soils, grasses, trees, and other vegetation and sourcing sustainable bioproducts and fuels.&nbsp; Coastal communities have an essential role to play in mitigating climate change and strengthening resilience by protecting and restoring coastal ecosystems, such as wetlands, seagrasses, coral and oyster reefs, and mangrove and kelp forests, to protect vulnerable coastlines, sequester carbon, and&nbsp;support biodiversity and fisheries.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Sec. 215. &nbsp;Civilian Climate Corps.<em>&nbsp; </em>In furtherance of the policy set forth in section 214 of this order, the Secretary of&nbsp;the Interior, in collaboration with the Secretary of Agriculture and the heads of other relevant agencies, shall submit a strategy to the Task Force within 90 days of the date of this order for creating a Civilian Climate Corps Initiative, within existing appropriations, to mobilize the next generation of conservation and resilience workers and maximize the creation of accessible training opportunities and good jobs.&nbsp; The initiative shall aim to conserve and restore public lands and waters, bolster community resilience, increase reforestation, increase carbon sequestration in the agricultural sector, protect biodiversity, improve access to recreation, and address the changing climate.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Sec. 216. &nbsp;Conserving Our Nation&#8217;s Lands and Waters.&nbsp; (a) &nbsp;The Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Commerce, the Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality, and the heads of other relevant agencies, shall submit a report to the Task Force within 90 days of the date of this order recommending steps that&nbsp;the United States should take, working with State, local, Tribal, and territorial governments, agricultural and forest landowners, fishermen, and other key stakeholders, to achieve the goal of conserving at least 30 percent of our lands and waters by 2030.</p>
<p>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp; The Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Commerce, through the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality shall, as appropriate, solicit input from State, local, Tribal, and territorial officials, agricultural and forest landowners, fishermen, and other key stakeholders in identifying strategies that will encourage broad participation in the goal of conserving 30 percent of&nbsp;our lands and waters by 2030.</p>
<p>(ii)&nbsp; The report shall propose guidelines for determining whether lands and waters qualify for conservation, and it also shall establish mechanisms to measure progress toward the 30-percent goal. &nbsp;The Secretary of the Interior shall subsequently submit annual reports to the Task Force to monitor progress.</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp; The Secretary of Agriculture shall:</p>
<p>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp; initiate efforts in the first 60 days from the date of this order to collect input from Tribes, farmers, ranchers, forest owners, conservation groups, firefighters, and other stakeholders on how to best use Department of Agriculture programs, funding and financing capacities, and other authorities, and how to encourage the voluntary adoption of climate-smart agricultural and forestry practices that decrease wildfire risk fueled by climate change and result in additional, measurable, and verifiable carbon reductions and sequestration and that source sustainable bioproducts and fuels; and</p>
<p>(ii)&nbsp; submit to the Task Force within 90 days of the date of this order a report making recommendations for an agricultural and forestry climate strategy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp; The Secretary of Commerce, through the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, shall initiate efforts in the first 60 days from the date of this order to collect input from fishermen, regional ocean councils, fishery management councils, scientists, and other stakeholders on how to make fisheries and protected resources more resilient to climate change, including changes in management and conservation measures, and improvements in science, monitoring, and cooperative research.</p>
<p>EMPOWERING WORKERS THROUGH REVITALIZING ENERGY COMMUNITIES</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Sec. 217. &nbsp;Policy. &nbsp;It is the policy of my Administration to improve air and water quality and to create well-paying union jobs and more opportunities for women and people of color in hard-hit communities, including rural communities, while reducing methane emissions, oil and brine leaks, and other environmental harms from tens of thousands of former mining and well sites. &nbsp;Mining and power plant workers drove the industrial revolution and the economic growth that followed, and have been essential to the growth of the United States.&nbsp; As the Nation shifts to a clean energy economy, Federal leadership is essential to foster economic revitalization of and investment in&nbsp;these communities, ensure the creation of good jobs that provide a choice to join a union, and secure the benefits that have been earned by workers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such work should include projects that reduce emissions of&nbsp;toxic substances and greenhouse gases from existing and abandoned infrastructure and that prevent environmental damage that harms communities and poses a risk to public health and safety.&nbsp; Plugging leaks in oil and gas wells and reclaiming abandoned mine land can create well-paying union jobs in coal, oil, and gas communities while restoring natural assets, revitalizing recreation economies, and curbing methane emissions.&nbsp; In addition, such work should include efforts to turn properties idled in these communities, such as brownfields, into new hubs for the growth of our economy.&nbsp; Federal agencies should therefore coordinate investments and other efforts to assist coal, oil and gas, and power plant communities, and achieve substantial reductions of methane emissions from the oil and gas sector as quickly as possible.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Sec. 218.&nbsp; Interagency Working Group on Coal and Power Plant Communities and Economic Revitalization<em>.&nbsp; </em>There is hereby established an Interagency Working Group on Coal and Power Plant Communities and Economic Revitalization (Interagency Working Group).&nbsp; The National Climate Advisor and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy shall serve as Co-Chairs of the Interagency Working Group.</p>

<p>(ii)&nbsp; As part of this effort, within 60 days of the date of this order, the Interagency Working Group shall submit a report to the President describing all&nbsp;mechanisms, consistent with applicable law, to prioritize grantmaking, Federal loan programs, technical assistance, financing, procurement, or other existing programs to support and revitalize the economies of coal and power plant communities, and providing recommendations for action consistent with the goals of the Interagency Working Group.</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp; Consultation.&nbsp; Consistent with the objectives set out&nbsp;in this order and in accordance with applicable law, the Interagency Working Group shall seek the views of State, local,&nbsp;and Tribal officials; unions; environmental justice organizations; community groups; and other persons it identifies who may have perspectives on the mission of the Interagency Working Group.</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp; Administration.&nbsp; The Interagency Working Group shall be housed within the Department of Energy.&nbsp; The Chairs shall convene regular meetings of the Interagency Working Group, determine its agenda, and direct its work.&nbsp; The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the Chairs, shall designate an Executive Director of the Interagency Working Group, who shall coordinate the work of the Interagency Working Group and head any staff assigned to the Interagency Working Group.</p>
<p>(e)&nbsp; Officers.&nbsp; To facilitate the work of the Interagency Working Group, the head of each agency listed in subsection (a) of this section shall assign a designated official within the agency the authority to represent the agency on the Interagency Working Group and perform such other duties relating to the implementation of this order within the agency as the head of the agency deems appropriate.</p>
<p>SECURING ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND SPURRING ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Sec. 219. &nbsp;Policy.&nbsp; To secure an equitable economic future, the United States must ensure that environmental and economic justice are key considerations in how we govern.&nbsp; That means investing and building a clean energy economy that creates well‑paying union jobs, turning disadvantaged communities &#8212; historically marginalized and overburdened &#8212; into healthy, thriving communities, and undertaking robust actions to mitigate climate change while preparing for the impacts of climate change across rural, urban, and Tribal areas.&nbsp; Agencies shall make achieving environmental justice part of their missions by developing programs, policies, and activities to address the disproportionately high and adverse human health, environmental, climate-related and other cumulative impacts on disadvantaged communities, as well as the accompanying economic challenges of such impacts.&nbsp; It is therefore the policy of my Administration to secure environmental justice and spur economic opportunity for disadvantaged communities that have been historically marginalized and overburdened by pollution and underinvestment in housing, transportation, water and wastewater infrastructure, and health care.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Sec. 220. &nbsp;White House Environmental Justice Interagency Council.<em>&nbsp; </em>(a)&nbsp; Section 1-102 of Executive Order 12898 of February 11, 1994 (Federal Actions To Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations), is&nbsp;hereby amended to read as follows:</p>

				<small>15 January, 2013</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>Tomorrow I&#8217;m giving a talk in the econometrics seminar at U.C. Riverside.  I was invited to speak on my work on network theory, so I don&#8217;t feel too bad about the fact that I&#8217;ll be saying only a little about economics and practically nothing about econometrics.  Still, I&#8217;ve tried to slant the talk in a way that emphasizes possible applications to economics and game theory.  Here are the slides:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/econ.pdf">Network Theory</a>.</p>
<p>For long-time readers here the fun comes near the end.  I explain how <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/networks_17.html">reaction networks</a> can be used to describe <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/06/24/information-geometry-part-12/">evolutionary games</a>.  I point out that in certain classes of evolutionary games, evolution tends to increase <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_%28biology%29">&#8216;fitness&#8217;</a>, and/or lead the players to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium">&#8216;Nash equilibrium&#8217;</a>.  For precise theorems you&#8217;ll have to click the links in my talk and read the references!   </p>
<p>I conclude with an example: a game with three strategies and 7 Nash equilibria.  Here evolution makes the proportion of these three strategies follow these flow lines, at least in the limit of large numbers of players:</p>

<p>This picture is from William Sandholm&#8217;s nice expository paper:</p>
<p>&bull; William H. Sandholm, <a href="http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~whs/research/egt.pdf">Evolutionary game theory</a>, 2007.</p>
<p>I mentioned it before in <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/06/24/information-geometry-part-12/">Information Geometry (Part 12)</a>, en route to showing a proof that some quantity always decreases in a class of evolutionary games.  Sometime I want to tell the whole story linking:</p>

				<small>27 October, 2012</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>Earlier this week I gave a talk on the <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/planet/planet_usc.pdf">Mathematics of Planet Earth</a> at the University of Southern California, and someone there recommended that I look into John Harte&#8217;s work on maximum entropy methods in ecology.  He works at U.C. Berkeley.  </p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltobias/2011/08/29/climate-shock-uc-berkeley-scientist-dr-john-harte-puts-the-world-on-notice/"><img width="300" src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs-images.forbes.com/michaeltobias/files/2011/08/John-Harte1.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>I checked out <a href="http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~hartelab/">his website</a> and found that his goals resemble mine: save the planet and understand its ecosystems.  He&#8217;s a lot further along than I am, since he comes from a long background in ecology while I&#8217;ve just recently blundered in from mathematical physics.  I can&#8217;t really say what I think of his work since I&#8217;m just learning about it.  But I thought I should point out its existence.</p>
<p>This free book is something a lot of people would find interesting:</p>
<p>&bull; John and Mary Ellen Harte, <a href="http://www.cooltheearth.us/download.php"><i>Cool the Earth, Save the Economy: Solving the Climate Crisis Is EASY</i></a>, 2008.</p>
<p>EASY?  Well, it&#8217;s an acronym.  Here&#8217;s the basic idea of the US-based plan described in this book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any proposed energy policy should include these two components:</p>
<p>&bull; <b>Technical/Behavioral</b>: What resources and technologies are to be used to supply energy? On the demand side, what technologies and lifestyle changes are being proposed to consumers?</p>
<p>&bull; <b>Incentives/Economic Policy</b>: How are the desired supply and demand options to be encouraged or forced? Here the options include taxes, subsidies, regulations, permits, research and development, and education.</p>
<p>And a successful energy policy should satisfy the AAA criteria:</p>
<p>&bull; <b>Availability</b>. The climate crisis will rapidly become costly to society if we do not take action expeditiously. We need to adopt now those technologies that are currently available, provided they meet the following two additional criteria:</p>
<p>&bull; <b>Affordability</b>. Because of the central role of energy in our society, its cost to consumers should not increase significantly. In fact, a successful energy policy could ultimately save consumers money.</p>
<p>&bull; <b>Acceptability</b>. All energy strategies have environmental, land use, and health and safety implications; these must be acceptable to the public. Moreover, while some interest groups will undoubtedly oppose any particular energy policy, political acceptability at a broad scale is necessary.</p>
<p>Our strategy for preventing climate catastrophe and achieving energy independence includes:</p>
<p>&bull; <b>Energy Efficient Technology</b> at home and at the workplace. Huge reductions in home energy use can be achieved with available technologies, including more efficient appliances such as refrigerators, water heaters, and light bulbs. Home retrofits and new home design features such as “smart” window coatings, lighter-colored roofs where there are hot summers, better home insulation, and passive solar designs can also reduce energy use. Together, energy efficiency in home and industry can save the U.S. up to approximately half of the energy currently consumed in those sectors, and at no net cost&#8212;just by making different choices. Sounds good, doesn’t it?</p>
<p>&bull; <b>Automobile Fuel Efficiency</b>. Phase in higher Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards for automobiles, SUVs and light trucks by requiring vehicles to go 35 miles per gallon of gas (mpg) by 2015, 45 mpg by 2020, and 60 mpg by 2030. This would rapidly wipe out our dependence on foreign oil and cut emissions from the vehicle sector by two-thirds. A combination of plug-in hybrid, lighter car body materials, re-design and other innovations could readily achieve these standards. This sounds good, too!</p>
<p>&bull; <b>Solar and Wind Energy</b>. Rooftop photovoltaic panels and solar water heating units should be phased in over the next 20 years, with the goal of solar installation on 75% of U.S. homes and commercial buildings by 2030. (Not all roofs receive sufficient sunlight to make solar panels practical for them.) Large wind farms, solar photovoltaic stations, and solar thermal stations should also be phased in so that by 2030, all U.S. electricity demand will be supplied by existing hydroelectric, existing and possibly some new nuclear, and, most importantly, new solar and wind units. This will require investment in expansion of the grid to bring the new supply to the demand, and in research and development to improve overnight storage systems. Achieving this goal would reduce our dependence on coal to practically zero. More good news!</p>
<p>&bull; <b>You</b> are part of the answer. Voting wisely for leaders who promote the first three components is one of the most important individual actions one can make. Other actions help, too. Just as molecules make up mountains, individual actions taken collectively have huge impacts. Improved driving skills, automobile maintenance, reusing and recycling, walking and biking, wearing sweaters in winter and light clothing in summer, installing timers on thermostats and insulating houses, carpooling, paying attention to energy efficiency labels on appliances, and many other simple practices and behaviors hugely influence energy consumption. A major education campaign, both in schools for youngsters and by the media for everyone, should be mounted to promote these consumer practices.</p>
<p>No part of EASY can be left out; all parts are closely integrated. Some parts might create much larger changes&#8212;for example, more efficient home appliances and automobiles&#8212;but all parts are essential. If, for example, we do not achieve the decrease in electricity demand that can be brought about with the E of EASY, then it is extremely doubtful that we could meet our electricity needs with the S of EASY.</p>
<p>It is equally urgent that once we start implementing the plan, we aggressively export it to other major emitting nations. We can reduce our own emissions all we want, but the planet will continue to warm if we can’t convince other major global emitters to reduce their emissions substantially, too.</p>
<p><b>What EASY will achieve.</b> If no actions are taken to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, in the year 2030 the U.S. will be emitting about 2.2 billion tons of carbon in the form of carbon dioxide. This will be an increase of 25% from today’s emission rate of about 1.75 billion tons per year of carbon. By following the EASY plan, the U.S. share in a global effort to solve the climate crisis (that is, prevent catastrophic warming) will result in U.S emissions of only about 0.4 billion tons of carbon by 2030, which represents a little less than 25% of 2007 carbon dioxide emissions.128 Stated differently, the plan provides a way to eliminate 1.8 billion tons per year of carbon by that date.</p>
<p>We must act urgently: in the 14 months it took us to write this book, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels rose by several billion tons of carbon, and more climatic consequences have been observed. Let’s assume that we conserve our forests and other natural carbon reservoirs at our current levels, as well as maintain our current nuclear and hydroelectric plants (or replace them with more solar and wind generators). Here’s what implementing EASY will achieve, as illustrated by Figure 3.1 on the next page.

<p>Please check out this book and help me figure out if the numbers add up!  I could also use help understanding <a href="http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~hartelab/Publications.html">his research</a>, for example:</p>
<p>&bull; John Harte, <i>Maximum Entropy and Ecology: A Theory of Abundance, Distribution, and Energetics</i>, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2011.</p>
<p>The book is not free but the <a href="http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.com/pdf/13/9780199593422_chapter1.pdf">first chapter</a> is.</p>
<p>This paper looks really interesting too:</p>
<p>&bull; J. Harte, T. Zillio, E. Conlisk and A. B. Smith, Maximum entropy and the state-variable approach to macroecology, <i><a href="http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/07-1369.1">Ecology</a></i> <b>89</b> (2008), 2700–-2711.  </p>
<p>Again, it&#8217;s not freely available&#8212;tut tut. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/emoticons/shame_on_you.gif" />  Ecologists should follow physicists and make their work free online; if you&#8217;re serious about saving the planet you should let everyone know what you&#8217;re doing!  However, the abstract is visible to all, and of course I can use my academic superpowers to get ahold of the paper for myself:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<b>Abstract</b>: The biodiversity scaling metrics widely studied in macroecology include the species-area relationship (SAR), the scale-dependent species-abundance distribution (SAD), the distribution of masses or metabolic energies of individuals within and across species, the abundance-energy or abundance-mass relationship across species, and the species-level occupancy distributions across space. We propose a theoretical framework for predicting the scaling forms of these and other metrics based on the state-variable concept and an analytical method derived from information theory. In statistical physics, a method of inference based on information entropy results in a complete macro-scale description of classical thermodynamic systems in terms of the state variables volume, temperature, and number of molecules. In analogy, we take the state variables of an ecosystem to be its total area, the total number of species within any specified taxonomic group in that area, the total number of individuals across those species, and the summed metabolic energy rate for all those individuals. In terms solely of ratios of those state variables, and without invoking any specific ecological mechanisms, we show that realistic functional forms for the macroecological metrics listed above are inferred based on information entropy. The Fisher log series SAD emerges naturally from the theory. The SAR is predicted to have negative curvature on a log-log plot, but as the ratio of the number of species to the number of individuals decreases, the SAR becomes better and better approximated by a power law, with the predicted slope z in the range of 0.14-0.20. Using the 3/4 power mass-metabolism scaling relation to relate energy requirements and measured body sizes, the Damuth scaling rule relating mass and abundance is also predicted by the theory. We argue that the predicted forms of the macroecological metrics are in reasonable agreement with the patterns observed from plant census data across habitats and spatial scales. While this is encouraging, given the absence of adjustable fitting parameters in the theory, we further argue that even small discrepancies between data and predictions can help identify ecological mechanisms that influence macroecological patterns.

<p>1. they express the <i>irreversibility</i> of certain natural phenomena, and </p>
<p>2. the dynamical processes underlying these phenomena involve an element of <i>randomness</i>. </p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t this suggest to you the following question: Could it be that thermal phenomena, forgetful information processing and adaptive evolution are governed by <i>the same stochastic mechanism?</i> </p>
<p>The answer is—yes! The key to this rather profound connection resides in a universal property of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_process">Markov processes</a> discovered recently in the context of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, and known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluctuation_theorem">&#8216;fluctuation theorem&#8217;</a>. Typically stated in terms of &#8216;dissipated work&#8217; or &#8216;entropy production&#8217;, this result can be seen as an extension of the Second Law of Thermodynamics to <i>small</i> systems, where thermal fluctuations cannot be neglected. But <i>it is actually much more than this</i>: it is the mathematical underpinning of irreversibility itself, be it thermodynamical, evolutionary, or else. To make this point clear, let me start by giving a general formulation of the fluctuation theorem that makes no reference to physics concepts such as &#8216;heat&#8217; or &#8216;work&#8217;.</p>
<h3> The mathematical fact </h3>
<p>Consider a system randomly jumping between states <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%2C+b%2C%5Cdots&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a, b,&#92;dots" class="latex" /> with (possibly time-dependent) transition rates <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma_%7Ba+b%7D%28t%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;gamma_{a b}(t)" class="latex" /> where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a" class="latex" /> is the state prior to the jump, while <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="b" class="latex" /> is the state after the jump. I&#8217;ll assume that this dynamics defines a (continuous-time) Markov process, namely that the numbers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma_%7Ba+b%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;gamma_{a b}" class="latex" /> are the matrix entries of an <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/networks_20.html">infinitesimal stochastic</a> matrix, which means that its off-diagonal entries are non-negative and that its columns sum up to zero. </p>
<p>Now, each possible history <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Comega%3D%28%5Comega_t%29_%7B0%5Cleq+t%5Cleq+T%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;omega=(&#92;omega_t)_{0&#92;leq t&#92;leq T}" class="latex" /> of this process can be characterized by the sequence of occupied states <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_%7Bj%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a_{j}" class="latex" /> and by the times <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau_%7Bj%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;tau_{j}" class="latex" /> at which the transitions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_%7Bj-1%7D%5Clongrightarrow+a_%7Bj%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a_{j-1}&#92;longrightarrow a_{j}" class="latex" /> occur <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%280%5Cleq+j%5Cleq+N%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(0&#92;leq j&#92;leq N)" class="latex" />:</p>

<p>Also define the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-information"><b>self-information</b></a> of the system in state <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a" class="latex" /> at time <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="t" class="latex" /> by:</p>

This quantity is also sometimes called the <b>surprisal</b>, as it measures the &#8216;surprise&#8217; of finding out that the system is in state <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a" class="latex" /> at time <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="t" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>Then the following identity&#8212;the <b>detailed fluctuation theorem</b>&#8212;holds:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BProb%7D%5B%5CDelta+i-%5CSigma%3D-A%5D+%3D+e%5E%7B-A%7D%5C%3B%5Cmathrm%7BProb%7D%5B%5CDelta+i-%5CSigma%3DA%5D+%5C%3B&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{Prob}[&#92;Delta i-&#92;Sigma=-A] = e^{-A}&#92;;&#92;mathrm{Prob}[&#92;Delta i-&#92;Sigma=A] &#92;;" class="latex" /></p>
<p>where </p>

<p>is the <b>cumulative skewness</b> along a trajectory of the system, and </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CDelta+i%3D+i_%7Ba_N%7D%28T%29-i_%7Ba_0%7D%280%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;Delta i= i_{a_N}(T)-i_{a_0}(0)" class="latex" /> </p>
<p>is the <b>variation of self-information</b> between the end points of this trajectory.  </p>
<p>This identity has an immediate consequence: if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle%5C%2C%5Ccdot%5C%2C%5Crangle&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;langle&#92;,&#92;cdot&#92;,&#92;rangle" class="latex" /> denotes the average over all realizations of the process, then we have the <b>integral fluctuation theorem</b>: </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+e%5E%7B-%5CDelta+i%2B%5CSigma%7D%5Crangle%3D1%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;langle e^{-&#92;Delta i+&#92;Sigma}&#92;rangle=1," class="latex" /></p>
<p>which, by the convexity of the exponential and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen%27s_inequality">Jensen&#8217;s inequality</a>, implies:</p>

<p>In short: <i>the mean variation of self-information, aka the variation of Shannon entropy</i> </p>

<p><i>is bounded from below by the mean cumulative skewness of the underlying stochastic trajectory.</i>  </p>
<p>This is the fundamental mathematical fact underlying irreversibility. To unravel its physical and biological consequences, it suffices to consider the origin and interpretation of the &#8216;skewness&#8217; term in different contexts. (By the way, people usually call <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CSigma&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;Sigma" class="latex" /> the &#8216;entropy production&#8217; or &#8216;dissipation function&#8217;&#8212;but how tautological is that?)</p>
<h3> The physical and biological consequences </h3>
<p>Consider first the standard stochastic-thermodynamic scenario where a physical system is kept in contact with a thermal reservoir at inverse temperature <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta" class="latex" /> and undergoes thermally induced transitions between states <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%2C+b%2C%5Cdots&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a, b,&#92;dots" class="latex" />. By virtue of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detailed_balance"><b>detailed balance condition</b></a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+e%5E%7B-%5Cbeta+E_%7Ba%7D%28t%29%7D%5Cgamma_%7Ba+b%7D%28t%29%3De%5E%7B-%5Cbeta+E_%7Bb%7D%28t%29%7D%5Cgamma_%7Bb+a%7D%28t%29%2C%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ e^{-&#92;beta E_{a}(t)}&#92;gamma_{a b}(t)=e^{-&#92;beta E_{b}(t)}&#92;gamma_{b a}(t),}" class="latex" /></p>
<p>the skewness <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csigma_%7Bj%7D%28%5Ctau_%7Bj%7D%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;sigma_{j}(&#92;tau_{j})" class="latex" /> of each such transition is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta " class="latex" /> times the energy difference between the states <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_%7Bj%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a_{j}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_%7Bj-1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a_{j-1}" class="latex" />, namely the <i>heat</i> received from the reservoir during the transition. Hence, the mean cumulative skewness <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5CSigma%5Crangle&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;langle &#92;Sigma&#92;rangle" class="latex" /> is nothing but <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta%5Clangle+Q%5Crangle%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta&#92;langle Q&#92;rangle," class="latex" /> with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Q" class="latex" /> the total heat received by the system along the process. It follows from the detailed fluctuation theorem that </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+e%5E%7B-%5CDelta+i%2B%5Cbeta+Q%7D%5Crangle%3D1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;langle e^{-&#92;Delta i+&#92;beta Q}&#92;rangle=1" class="latex" /></p>

<p>which is of course <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clausius_theorem">Clausius&#8217; inequality</a>. In a computational context where the control parameter is the entropy variation itself (such as in a bit-erasure protocol, where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CDelta+S%3D-%5Cln+2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;Delta S=-&#92;ln 2" class="latex" />), this inequality in turn expresses Landauer&#8217;s principle: it impossible to decrease the self-information of the system&#8217;s state without dissipating a minimal amount of heat into the environment (in this case <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=-Q+%5Cgeq+k+T%5Cln2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="-Q &#92;geq k T&#92;ln2" class="latex" />, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landauer%27s_principle">&#8216;Landauer bound&#8217;</a>). More general situations (several types of reservoirs, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell_demon">Maxwell-demon</a>-like feedback controls) can be treated along the same lines, and the various forms of the Second Law derived from the detailed fluctuation theorem. </p>
<p>Now, many would agree that evolutionary dynamics is a wholly different business from thermodynamics; in particular, notions such as &#8216;heat&#8217; or &#8216;temperature&#8217; are clearly irrelevant to Darwinian evolution. However, the stochastic framework of Markov processes <i>is</i> relevant to describe the genetic evolution of a population, and this fact alone has important consequences. As a simple example, consider the time evolution of mutant fixations <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Ba%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x_{a}" class="latex" /> in a population, with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a" class="latex" /> ranging over the possible genotypes. In a &#8216;symmetric mutation scheme&#8217;, which I understand is biological parlance for &#8216;reversible Markov process&#8217;, meaning one that obeys <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detailed_balance">detailed balance</a>, the ratio between the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%5Cmapsto+b&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a&#92;mapsto b" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b%5Cmapsto+a&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="b&#92;mapsto a" class="latex" /> transition rates is completely determined by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_landscape"><b>fitnesses</b></a> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%7Ba%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_{a}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_b&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_b" class="latex" /> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="b" class="latex" />, according to </p>

<p>discussed recently by Mustonen and L&auml;ssig [Mustonen2010] and implying Fisher&#8217;s fundamental theorem of natural selection as a special case. (Incidentally, the &#8216;fitness flux theorem&#8217; derived in this reference is more general than this; for instance, it does not rely on the &#8216;symmetric mutation scheme&#8217; assumption above.) The ensuing inequality </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5CPhi%5Crangle%5Cgeq-%5CDelta+S+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;langle &#92;Phi&#92;rangle&#92;geq-&#92;Delta S " class="latex" /> </p>
<p>shows that a positive fitness flux is &#8220;an almost universal evolutionary principle of biological systems&#8221; [Mustonen2010], with negative contributions limited to time intervals with a systematic loss of adaptation (<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CDelta+S+%3E+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;Delta S &gt; 0" class="latex" />). This statement may well be the closest thing to a version of the Second Law of Thermodynamics applying to evolutionary dynamics. </p>
<p>It is really quite remarkable that thermodynamical dissipation and Darwinian evolution can be reduced to the same stochastic mechanism, and that notions such as &#8216;fitness flux&#8217; and &#8216;heat&#8217; can arise as two faces of the same mathematical coin, namely the &#8216;skewness&#8217; of Markovian transitions. After all, the phenomenon of life is in itself a direct challenge to thermodynamics, isn&#8217;t it? When thermal phenomena tend to increase the world&#8217;s disorder, life strives to bring about and maintain exquisitely fine spatial and chemical structures&#8212;which is why Schr&ouml;dinger famously proposed to <i>define</i> life as <i>negative entropy</i>. Could there be a more striking confirmation of his intuition&#8212;and a reconciliation of evolution and thermodynamics in the same go&#8212;than the fundamental inequality of adaptive evolution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle%5CPhi%5Crangle%5Cgeq-%5CDelta+S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;langle&#92;Phi&#92;rangle&#92;geq-&#92;Delta S" class="latex" />?</p>
<p>Surely the detailed fluctuation theorem for Markov processes has other applications, pertaining neither to thermodynamics nor adaptive evolution. Can you think of any?</p>

<p>The same theorem can be formulated for other kinds of Markov processes as well, including diffusion processes (in which case it follows from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girsanov_theorem">Girsanov theorem</a>).</p>

<p>Landauer&#8217;s principle was introduced here:</p>
<p>&bull; [Landauer1961]  R. Landauer, Irreversibility and heat generation in the computing process}, <i>IBM Journal of Research and Development</i> <b>5</b>, (1961) 183&#8211;191.</p>
<p>and is now being verified experimentally by various groups worldwide.</p>
<p>The &#8216;fundamental theorem of natural selection&#8217; was derived by Fisher in his book:</p>
<p>&bull; [Fisher1930]  R. Fisher, <i>The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection</i>, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1930.</p>
<p>His derivation has long been considered obscure, even perhaps wrong, but apparently the theorem is now well accepted. I believe the first Markovian models of genetic evolution appeared here:</p>

			<div class="textwidget"><p>You can <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics">include math in your comments using LaTeX</a>,  but you need to do it this way:</p>
<p>&#036;latex  E = mc^2&#036;</p>
<p>You need the word 'latex' right after the first dollar sign, and it needs a space after it.  Double dollar signs don't work, and other limitations apply, some described <a href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/latex/">here</a>.  You can't preview comments here, but I'm happy to fix errors.</p>
