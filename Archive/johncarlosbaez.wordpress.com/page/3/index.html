					<p>I&#8217;m giving a talk on Monday the 31st of May, 2021 at 17:20 UTC, which happens to be 10:20 am Pacific Time for me. You can see my slides here:</p>
<p>• <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/robotics/networks_robotics_web.pdf">Category theory and systems</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll talk about how to describe open systems as morphisms in symmetric monoidal categories, and how to use &#8216;functorial semantics&#8217; to describe the behavior of open systems.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s part of the <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2021/05/27/compositional-robotics-part-2/">2021 Workshop on Compositional Robotics: Mathematics and Tools</a>, and if you click the link you can see how to attend!&nbsp; If you stick around for the rest of the workshop you&#8217;ll hear more concrete talks from people who really work on robotics.&nbsp; </p>

				<h2><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2021/05/26/court-orders-deep-carbon-cuts-for-shell/" rel="bookmark">Court Orders Deep Carbon Cuts for&nbsp;Shell</a></h2>
				<small>26 May, 2021</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>Whoa!   Today a Dutch court ordered Shell to reduce its carbon emissions by 45% by 2030 from 2019 levels!</p>
<p>&#8220;The court orders Royal Dutch Shell, by means of its corporate policy, to reduce its CO2 emissions by 45% by 2030 with respect to the level of 2019 for the Shell group and the suppliers and customers of the group,&#8221; the judge said.</p>
<p>Including <em>customers</em>&#8212;people who buy gasoline and other products from Shell and <em>burn</em> the stuff&#8212;means that Shell has to sell less of that stuff.</p>
<p>This is the first time a court has ruled a company needs to reduce its carbon emissions.   It was possible because a Dutch court had earlier ruled that failing to slow global warming will lead to human rights violations.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Earlier this year Shell set out one of the sector&#8217;s most ambitious climate strategies. It has a target to cut the carbon intensity of its products by at least 6% by 2023, by 20% by 2030, by 45% by 2035 and by 100% by 2050 from 2016 levels.</p>
<p>But the court said that Shell&#8217;s climate policy was &#8220;not concrete and is full of conditions&#8230;that&#8217;s not enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The conclusion of the court is therefore that Shell is in danger of violating its obligation to reduce. And the court will therefore issue an order upon RDS,&#8221; the judge said.</p>
<p>The court ordered Shell to reduce its absolute levels of carbon emissions, while Shell&#8217;s intensity-based targets could allow the company to grow its output in theory.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is arguably the most significant climate change related judgment yet, which emphasises that companies and not just governments may be the target of strategic litigation which seeks to drive changes in behaviour,&#8221; said Tom Cummins, dispute resolution partner at law firm Ashurst.</p>
<p>Shell said that it would appeal the verdict and that it has set out its plan to become a net-zero emissions energy company by 2050.</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s a quote from here:</p>
<p>• Bart Meijer, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/dutch-court-orders-shell-set-tougher-climate-targets-2021-05-26/">Dutch court orders Shell to deepen carbon cuts in landmark ruling</a>, <i>Reuters</i>, 26 May 2021.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what Friends of the Earth Netherlands <a href="https://www.foei.org/press_releases/climate-legal-summons-submitted-shell">said</a> on April 5, 2019, when they brought this case against Shell:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Donald Pols, Director of Friends of the Earth Netherlands said:</p>
<blockquote><p>
    “Shell’s directors still do not want to say goodbye to oil and gas. They would pull the world into the abyss. The judge can prevent this from happening”
</p></blockquote>
<p>In the court summons, Friends of the Earth Netherlands outlines why it is bringing this groundbreaking climate litigation case against Shell, highlighting the company’s <a href="https://www.ciel.org/reports/a-crack-in-the-shell/">early knowledge of climate change</a> and its own role in causing it. Despite acknowledging that the fossil fuel industry has a responsibility to act on climate change, and claiming to “strongly support” the Paris Agreement, Shell continues to lobby against climate policy and to invest billions in further oil and gas extraction. This is incompatible with global climate goals.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/">2018 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report</a>, a key piece of evidence in this case, underlines the importance of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees for the protection of ecosystems and human lives, and outlines the devastating and potentially irreversible impacts of any “extra bit of warming”.</p>
<p>The court summons proves that Shell&#8217;s current climate ambitions do not guarantee any emissions reductions, but would in fact contribute to a huge overshoot of 1.5 degrees of global warming. The plaintiffs argue that Shell is violating its duty of care and threatening human rights by knowingly undermining the world’s chances to stay below 1.5C.</p>
<p>In addition, the plaintiffs argue that Shell is violating Articles 2 and 8 of the <a href="https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a>: the right to life and the right to family life. In the historic <a href="https://www.urgenda.nl/en/themas/climate-case/">Urgenda case against the Dutch state</a>, the Dutch Appeals court created a precedent by ruling that a failure to achieve climate goals leads to human rights violations. The court ordered the Dutch state to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 25% by the end of 2020.</p>
<p>Roger Cox, who initially represented Urgenda, is now leading Friends of the Earth’s case against Shell. Roger said:</p>
<blockquote><p>
    “If successful, the uniqueness of the case would be that Shell, as one of the largest multinational corporations in the world would be legally obligated to change its business operations. We also expect that this would have an effect on other fossil fuel companies, raising the pressure on them to change.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>If successful the court case would rule that Shell must reduce its CO2 emissions by 45% by 2030 compared to 2010 levels and to zero by 2050, in line with Climate Paris Accord. This would have major implications, requiring Shell to move away from fossil fuels.
</p></blockquote>

				<small>24 May, 2021</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>Say you know the roots of a polynomial <i>P</i> and you want to know the roots of its derivative.  You can do it using physics!  Namely, electrostatics in 2d space, viewed as the complex plane.</p>
<p>To keep things simple, let us assume <i>P</i> does not have repeated roots.  Then the procedure works as follows.</p>
<p>Put equal point charges at each root of <i>P</i>, then see where the resulting electric field vanishes.  Those are the roots of <i>P&#8217;</i>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll explain why this is true a bit later.  But first, we use this trick to see something cool.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no way the electric field can vanish outside the convex hull of your set of point charges.  After all, if all the charges are positive, the electric field must point <i>out</i> of that region.  So, the roots of <i>P&#8217;</i> must lie in the convex hull of the roots of <i>P</i>!</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/convex-hull"><br />
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/convex_hull.jpg" /><br />
</a></div>
<p>This cool fact is called the Gauss–Lucas theorem.  It always seemed mysterious to me.  Now, thanks to this &#8216;physics proof&#8217;, it seems completely obvious!</p>
<p>Of course, it relies on my first claim: that if we put equal point<br />
charges at the roots of <i>P</i>, the electric field they generate will vanish at the roots of <i>P&#8217;</i>.   Why is this true?</p>
<p>By multiplying by a constant if necessary, we can assume</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+++P%28z%29+%3D+%5Cprod_%7Bi+%3D+1%7D%5En++%28z+-+a_i%29+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{   P(z) = &#92;prod_{i = 1}^n  (z - a_i) } " class="latex" />
</div>
<p>Thus</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B++%5Cln+%7CP%28z%29%7C+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bi+%3D+1%7D%5En+%5Cln%7Cz+-+a_i%7C+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{  &#92;ln |P(z)| = &#92;sum_{i = 1}^n &#92;ln|z - a_i| } " class="latex" />
</div>
<p>This function is the electric potential created by equal point charges at the points <i>a<sub>i</sub></i> in the complex plane.  The corresponding electric field is minus the gradient of the potential, so it vanishes at the critical points of this function.  Equivalently, it vanishes at the critical points of the exponential of this function, namely |<i>P</i>|.  Apart from one possible exception, these points are the same as the critical points of <i>P</i>, namely the roots of <i>P&#8217;</i>.  So, we&#8217;re almost done!</p>
<p>The exception occurs when <i>P</i> has a critical point where <i>P</i> vanishes.  |P| is not smooth where <i>P</i> vanishes, so in this case we cannot say the critical point of <i>P</i> is a critical point of <i>|P|</i>.</p>
<p>However, when <i>P</i> has a critical point where <i>P</i> vanishes, then this point is a repeated root of <i>P</i>, and I already said I&#8217;m assuming <i>P</i> has no repeated roots.   So, we&#8217;re done&#8212;given this assumption.</p>
<p>Everything gets a bit more complicated when our polynomial has repeated roots.  <a href="https://twitter.com/gregeganSF/status/1396782606721503240">Greg Egan</a> explored this, and also the case where its derivative has repeated roots.</p>
<div class="embed-twitter">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="450" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">And this is what it looks like if the original polynomial has a repeated root: the blue disk in the upper left is both a root of the derivative and the repeated root of the original polynomial. <a href="https://t.co/eeNg3f0PFV">pic.twitter.com/eeNg3f0PFV</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Greg Egan (@gregeganSF) <a href="https://twitter.com/gregeganSF/status/1396782968325111812?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 24, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>However, the Gauss–Lucas theorem still applies to polynomials with repeated roots, and this proof explains why:</p>
<p>• Wikipedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Lucas_theorem">Gauss–Lucas theorem</a>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, it should be possible to handle the case of a polynomial with repeated roots by thinking of it as a limit of polynomials without repeated roots.</p>
<p>By the way, in my physics proof of the Gauss&#8211;Lucas theorem I said the electric field generated by a bunch of positive point charges cannot vanish outside the convex hull of these point charges because the field &#8216;points out&#8217; of this region.  Let me clarify that.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true even if the positive point charges aren&#8217;t all equal; they just need to have the same sign.  The rough idea is that each charge creates an electric field that points radially outward, so these electric fields can&#8217;t cancel at a point that&#8217;s not &#8216;between&#8217; several charges&#8212;in other words, at a point that&#8217;s not in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull">convex hull</a> of the charges.</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s turn this idea into a rigorous argument.</p>
<p>Suppose <i>z</i> is some point outside the convex hull of the points <i>a<sub>i</sub></i>.  Then, by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplane_separation_theorem">hyperplane separation theorem</a>, we can draw a line with <i>z</i> on one side and all the points <i>a<sub>i</sub></i> on the other side.  Let <i>v</i> be a vector normal to this line and pointing toward the <i>z</i> side.  Then</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v+%5Ccdot+%28z+-+a_i%29+%3E+0+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="v &#92;cdot (z - a_i) &gt; 0 " class="latex" /></div>
<p>for all <i>i</i>.  Since the electric field created by the <i>i</i>th point charge is a positive multiple of <i>z &#8211; a<sub>i</sub></i> at the point <i>z</i>, the total electric field at <i>z</i> has a positive dot product with <i>v</i>.  So, it can&#8217;t be zero!</p>

				<small>22 May, 2021</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>Here&#8217;s an idea I got from <a href="https://twitter.com/theAlbertChern/status/1395468792788967428">Albert Chern</a> on Twitter.  He did all the hard work, and I think he also drew the picture I&#8217;m going to use.   I&#8217;ll just express the idea in a different way.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a strange fact about Newtonian gravity.</p>
<p>Consider three parallel &#8216;line masses&#8217; that have a constant mass per length&#8212;the same constant for each one.   Choose a plane orthogonal to these lines.     There will typically be two points on this plane, say <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, where a mass can sit in equilibrium, with the gravitational pull from all three lines masses cancelling out.  This will be an unstable equilibrium.</p>
<p>Put a mass at point <i>a</i>.   Remove the three line masses&#8212;but keep in mind the triangle they formed where they pierced your plane!</p>
<p>You can now orbit a test particle in an elliptical orbit around the mass at <i>a</i> in such a way that:</p>
<p>&bull; one focus of this ellipse is <i>a</i>,<br />
&bull; the other focus is <i>b</i>, and<br />
&bull; the ellipse fits inside the triangle, just touching the midpoint of each side of the triangle.</p>
<p>Even better, this ellipse has the <em>largest possible area</em> of any ellipse contained in the triangle!</p>
<p>Here is Chern&#8217;s picture:</p>

<p>The triangle&#8217;s corners are the three points where the line masses pierce your chosen plane.  These line masses create a gravitational potential, and the contour lines are level curves of this potential.</p>
<p>You can see that the points <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are at saddle points of the potential.  Thus, a mass placed at either <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> will be in an unstable equilibrium.</p>
<p>You can see the ellipse with <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> as its foci, snugly fitting into the triangle.</p>
<p>You can sort of see that the ellipse touches the <i>midpoints</i> of the triangle&#8217;s edges.</p>
<p>What you <em>can&#8217;t</em> see is that this ellipse has the largest possible area for any ellipse fitting into the triangle!</p>
<p>Now let me explain the math.  While the gravitational potential of a point mass in 3d space is proportional to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2Fr&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="1/r" class="latex" />, the gravitational potential of a line mass in 3d space is proportional to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clog+r%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;log r," class="latex" /> which is also the gravitational potential of a point mass in 2d space.</p>
<p>So, if we have three equal line masses, which are parallel and pierce an orthogonal plane at points <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_1%2C+p_2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p_1, p_2" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_3%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p_3," class="latex" /> then their gravitational potential, as a function on this plane, will be proportional to</p>

<p>Here I&#8217;m using <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="z" class="latex" /> as our name for an arbitrary point on this plane, because the next trick is to think of this plane as the <em>complex</em> plane!</p>
<p>Where are the critical points (in fact saddle points) of this potential?  They are just points where the gradient of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;phi" class="latex" /> vanishes.  To find these points, we can just take the exponential of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;phi" class="latex" /> and see where the gradient of <em>that</em> vanishes.  This is a nice idea because</p>

</div>
<p>The gradient of this function will vanish whenever</p>

<p>Since <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="P" class="latex" /> is a cubic polynomial, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%27&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="P&#039;" class="latex" /> is a quadratic, hence proportional to</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marden%27s_theorem">Marden&#8217;s theorem.</a></strong>  Suppose the zeros <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_1%2C+p_2%2C+p_3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p_1, p_2, p_3" class="latex" /> of a cubic polynomial <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="P" class="latex" /> are non-collinear.  Then there is a unique ellipse inscribed in the triangle with vertices <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_1%2C+p_2%2C+p_3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p_1, p_2, p_3" class="latex" /> and tangent to the sides at their midpoints.  The foci of this ellipse are the zeroes of the derivative of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="P." class="latex" /></p>
<p>For a short proof of this theorem go here:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.su.se/polopoly_fs/1.229312.1426783194!/menu/standard/file/marden.pdf">Carlson&#8217;s proof of Marden&#8217;s theorem</a>.</p>
<p>This ellipse is called the <strong>Steiner inellipse</strong> of the triangle:</p>
<p>&bull; Wikipedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steiner_inellipse">Steiner inellipse</a>.</p>
<p>The proof that it has the largest area of any ellipse inscribed in the triangle goes like this.  Using a linear transformation of the plane you can map any triangle to an equilateral triangle.  It&#8217;s obvious that there&#8217;s a circle inscribed in any equilateral triangle, touching each of the triangle&#8217;s midpoints.  It&#8217;s at least very plausible that that this circle is the ellipse of largest area contained in the triangle.   If we can prove this we&#8217;re done.</p>
<p>Why?   Because linear transformations map circles to ellipses, and map midpoints of line segments to midpoints of line segments, and simply rescale areas by a constant fact.  So applying the <em>inverse</em> linear transformation to the circle inscribed in the equilateral triangle, we get an ellipse inscribed in our original triangle, which will touch this triangle&#8217;s midpoints, and have the maximum possible area of any ellipse contained in this triangle!</p>

<p>Together with <a href="">William Cannon</a> and <a href="https://iigb.ucr.edu/blli/">Larry Li</a>, I&#8217;m helping run a minisymposium as part of <a href="https://www.smb2021.org/home">SMB2021</a>, the annual meeting of the Society for Mathematical Biology:</p>
<p>• Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics in Biology: from Chemical Reaction Networks to Natural Selection, Monday June 14, 2021, beginning 9:30 am Pacific Time.</p>
<p>You can register for free <a href="https://www.smb2021.org/registration">here</a> before May 31st, 11:59 pm Pacific Time.  You need to register to watch the talks live on Zoom.  I think the talks will be recorded.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the idea:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <strong>Abstract:</strong> Since Lotka, ﻿physical scientists have argued that living things belong to a class of complex and orderly systems that exist not despite the second law of thermodynamics, but because of it. Life and evolution, through natural selection of dissipative structures, are based on non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The challenge is to develop an understanding of what the respective physical laws can tell us about flows of energy and matter in living systems, and about growth, death and selection. This session will address current challenges including understanding emergence, regulation and control across scales, and entropy production, from metabolism in microbes to evolving ecosystems.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s exciting to me because I want to get back into work on thermodynamics and reaction networks, and we&#8217;ll have some excellent speakers on these topics.  I think the talks will be in this order&#8230; later I will learn the exact schedule.</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Heat flows adjust local ion concentrations in favor of prebiotic chemistry</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <strong>Abstract:</strong> Prebiotic reactions often require certain initial concentrations of ions. For example, the activity of RNA enzymes requires a lot of divalent magnesium salt, whereas too much monovalent sodium salt leads to a reduction in enzyme function. However, it is known from leaching experiments that prebiotically relevant geomaterial such as basalt releases mainly a lot of sodium and only little magnesium. A natural solution to this problem is heat fluxes through thin rock fractures, through which magnesium is actively enriched and sodium is depleted by thermogravitational convection and thermophoresis. This process establishes suitable conditions for ribozyme function from a basaltic leach. It can take place in a spatially distributed system of rock cracks and is therefore particularly stable to natural fluctuations and disturbances.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Stochastic chemical reaction networks</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <strong>Abstract:</strong> The study of chemical reaction networks (CRNs) is a very active field. Earlier well-known results (Feinberg Chem. Enc. Sci. 42 2229 (1987), Anderson et al Bull. Math. Biol. 72 1947 (2010)) identify a topological quantity called deficiency, easy to compute for CRNs of any size, which, when exactly equal to zero, leads to a unique factorized (non-equilibrium) steady-state for these networks. No general results exist however for the steady states of non-zero-deficiency networks. In recent work, we show how to write the full moment-hierarchy for any non-zero-deficiency CRN obeying mass-action kinetics, in terms of equations for the factorial moments. Using these, we can recursively predict values for lower moments from higher moments, reversing the procedure usually used to solve moment hierarchies. We show, for non-trivial examples, that in this manner we can predict any moment of interest, for CRNs with non-zero deficiency and non-factorizable steady states. It is however an open question how scalable these techniques are for large networks.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Nonequilibrium biomolecular information processes</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <strong>Abstract:</strong> Nearly 70 years have passed since the discovery of DNA structure and its role in coding genetic information. Yet, the kinetics and thermodynamics of genetic information processing in DNA replication, transcription, and translation remain poorly understood. These template-directed copolymerization processes are running away from equilibrium, being powered by extracellular energy sources. Recent advances show that their kinetic equations can be exactly solved in terms of so-called iterated function systems. Remarkably, iterated function systems can determine the effects of genome sequence on replication errors, up to a million times faster than kinetic Monte Carlo algorithms. With these new methods, fundamental links can be established between molecular information processing and the second law of thermodynamics, shedding a new light on genetic drift, mutations, and evolution.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Reduction and the Quasi-Steady State Approximation</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <strong>Abstract:</strong> Chemical reactions often occur at different time-scales. In applications of chemical reaction network theory it is often desirable to reduce a reaction network to a smaller reaction network by elimination of fast species or fast reactions. There exist various techniques for doing so, e.g. the Quasi-Steady-State Approximation or the Rapid Equilibrium Approximation. However, these methods are not always mathematically justifiable.  Here, a method is presented for which (so-called) non-interacting species are eliminated by means of QSSA. It is argued that this method is mathematically sound. Various examples are given (Michaelis-Menten mechanism, two-substrate mechanism, &#8230;) and older related techniques from the 50-60ies are briefly discussed.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Deficiency of chemical reaction networks and thermodynamics</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <strong>Abstract:</strong> Deficiency is a topological property of a Chemical Reaction Network linked to important dynamical features, in particular of deterministic fixed points and of stochastic stationary states. Here we link it to thermodynamics: in particular we discuss the validity of a strong vs. weak zeroth law, the existence of time-reversed mass-action kinetics, and the possibility to formulate marginal fluctuation relations. Finally we illustrate some subtleties of the Python module we created for MCMC stochastic simulation of CRNs, soon to be made public.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>
  <strong>Abstract:</strong> Maximum Caliber is a principle for inferring pathways and rate distributions of kinetic processes.  The structure and foundations of MaxCal are much like those of Maximum Entropy for static distributions.  We have explored how MaxCal may serve as a general variational principle for nonequilibrium statistical physics &#8211; giving well-known results, such as the Green-Kubo relations, Onsager&#8217;s reciprocal relations and Prigogine&#8217;s Minimum Entropy Production principle near equilibrium, but is also applicable far from equilibrium.  I will also discuss some applications, such as finding reaction coordinates in molecular simulations non-linear dynamics in gene circuits, power-law-tail distributions in &#8220;social-physics&#8221; networks, and others.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Using the maximum entropy production principle to understand and predict microbial biogeochemistry</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <strong>Abstract:</strong> Natural microbial communities contain billions of individuals per liter and can exceed a trillion cells per liter in sediments, as well as harbor thousands of species in the same volume. The high species diversity contributes to extensive metabolic functional capabilities to extract chemical energy from the environment, such as methanogenesis, sulfate reduction, anaerobic photosynthesis, chemoautotrophy, and many others, most of which are only expressed by bacteria and archaea. Reductionist modeling of natural communities is problematic, as we lack knowledge on growth kinetics for most organisms and have even less understanding on the mechanisms governing predation, viral lysis, and predator avoidance in these systems. As a result, existing models that describe microbial communities contain dozens to hundreds of parameters, and state variables are extensively aggregated. Overall, the models are little more than non-linear parameter fitting exercises that have limited, to no, extrapolation potential, as there are few principles governing organization and function of complex self-assembling systems. Over the last decade, we have been developing a systems approach that models microbial communities as a distributed metabolic network that focuses on metabolic function rather than describing individuals or species. We use an optimization approach to determine which metabolic functions in the network should be up regulated versus those that should be down regulated based on the non-equilibrium thermodynamics principle of maximum entropy production (MEP). Derived from statistical mechanics, MEP proposes that steady state systems will likely organize to maximize free energy dissipation rate. We have extended this conjecture to apply to non-steady state systems and have proposed that living systems maximize entropy production integrated over time and space, while non-living systems maximize instantaneous entropy production. Our presentation will provide a brief overview of the theory and approach, as well as present several examples of applying MEP to describe the biogeochemistry of microbial systems in laboratory experiments and natural ecosystems.</p></blockquote>

  <strong>Abstract:</strong> The standard mathematical model for the dynamics of concentrations in biochemical networks is called mass-action kinetics. We describe mass-action kinetics and discuss the connection between special classes of mass-action systems (such as detailed balanced and complex balanced systems) and the Boltzmann equation. We also discuss the connection between the &#8220;global attractor conjecture&#8221; for complex balanced mass-action systems and Boltzmann&#8217;s H-theorem. We also describe some implications for biochemical mechanisms that implement noise filtering and cellular homeostasis.</p></blockquote>

  <strong>Abstract:</strong> The mathematical theory of large deviations provides a nonequilibrium thermodynamic description of complex biological systems that consist of heterogeneous individuals. In terms of the notions of stochastic elementary reactions and pure kinetic species, the continuous-time, integer-valued Markov process dictates a thermodynamic structure that generalizes (i) Gibbs’ macroscopic chemical thermodynamics of equilibrium matters to nonequilibrium small systems such as living cells and tissues; and (ii) Gibbs’ potential function to the landscapes for biological dynamics, such as that of C. H. Waddington’s and S. Wright’s.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Nonequilibrium dynamics of disturbed ecosystems</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <strong>Abstract:</strong> The Maximum Entropy Theory of Ecology (METE) predicts the shapes of macroecological metrics in relatively static ecosystems, across spatial scales, taxonomic categories, and habitats, using constraints imposed by static state variables. In disturbed ecosystems, however, with time-varying state variables, its predictions often fail. We extend macroecological theory from static to dynamic, by combining the MaxEnt inference procedure with explicit mechanisms governing disturbance. In the static limit, the resulting theory, DynaMETE, reduces to METE but also predicts a new scaling relationship among static state variables. Under disturbances, expressed as shifts in demographic, ontogenic growth, or migration rates, DynaMETE predicts the time trajectories of the state variables as well as the time-varying shapes of macroecological metrics such as the species abundance distribution and the distribution of metabolic rates over individuals. An iterative procedure for solving the dynamic theory is presented. Characteristic signatures of the deviation from static predictions of macroecological patterns are shown to result from different kinds of disturbance. By combining MaxEnt inference with explicit dynamical mechanisms of disturbance, DynaMETE is a candidate theory of macroecology for ecosystems responding to anthropogenic or natural disturbances.</p></blockquote>

<p>A bit of good news near my home.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/environment/2021/05/03/crimson-solar-project-west-blythe-receives-federal-approval/4927008001/">On Monday May 3rd</a>, the U.S Department of the Interior approved a new solar project in southern California. It&#8217;ll occupy about 2000 acres in the desert near Blythe&#8212;a town near the border with Arizona, and the Colorado River.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s called the Crimson Solar Project. It&#8217;s a 350-megawatt solar photovoltaic facility that will cost about $550 million. They say it will be able to power about 87,500 homes.</p>
<p>The choice of site for this solar project is part of California&#8217;s <a href="https://www.energy.ca.gov/programs-and-topics/programs/desert-renewable-energy-conservation-plan">Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan</a>.</p>
<p>The publication <i><a href="https://thehill.com/changing-america/sustainability/energy/551668-biden-administration-oks-massive-solar-project">The Hill</a></i> says this project will &#8220;store up to 530 megawatts of energy&#8221;&#8212;but I have no idea what that means, since megawatts isn&#8217;t a unit of energy.</p>

				<small>29 April, 2021</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>Near the beginning of the pandemic I heard <a href="https://youtu.be/QAvi0oI9fiI?t=447">a conversation</a> where Brian Eno said that he&#8217;d been listening to a radio station on the internet, based somewhere deep in rural Russia, that plays nothing but Eastern Orthodox chants 24 hours a day, with no announcements.  He said that this sort of music appealed to him while locked down at home.</p>
<p>Somehow this led to me listening to a lot of early music on YouTube.  I started with some Baroque composers I&#8217;d never paid attention to before, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=corelli+complete+edition">Corelli</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMLSwqAOzHo&amp;t=6258s">Albinoni</a>.   Previously my interest in classical music started around Beethoven and focused on the 20th century, with Bach and Vivaldi as brilliant pearls surrounded by darkness.  As I began listening to more Baroque music I became very happy, like someone who&#8217;d been locked in a room for years and suddenly found a key to another room.  There was so much to explore.</p>
<p>The Baroque period lasted from about 1580 to 1750: that&#8217;s almost two centuries of music!  By getting to know it, I&#8217;ve been starting to understand the birth of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_practice_period">common practice tonality</a>&#8212;that is, the language of chord progressions that dominates classical music, and also, to some extent, lots of modern pop music.  And I can finally start thinking clearly about what makes Bach great.</p>
<p>Imagine listening to just one rock group, or one jazz band.  Practically nobody does that, of course, but imagine it: it would be impossible to distinguish what&#8217;s special to the artist you love from what&#8217;s common to the style as a whole.   So you&#8217;d think they were more creative than they really are&#8212;but you also wouldn&#8217;t know what was <i>truly</i> creative about their work.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still in the midst of this project, which also includes listening to Bach more thoroughly.   But I got a bit distracted.   I got pulled back further in time&#8212;back into Renaissance polyphony.  This gave me access to another two centuries of rich, complicated music, roughly 1400 to 1600.  And it let me understand the <i>roots</i> of Bach&#8217;s music.  Bach&#8217;s music looks back to polyphony just as much as it looks forward into the future.  For this he was considered a bit old-fashioned during his day; only later did people realize his greatness.</p>
<p>The best of Renaissance polyphony is arguably just as complex and interesting as Bach&#8217;s counterpoint: it&#8217;s just less immediately <i>gripping</i>.  The reason is that it doesn&#8217;t follow &#8216;common practice&#8217;, with its familiar strategies of building and releasing tension, and its repetitive rhythmic pulse.   The vocal lines are often very smooth, flowing like water.  So it&#8217;s less exciting, but it&#8217;s wonderfully <i>entrancing</i>.</p>
<p>I went back even further, into the medieval&#8212;but at a certain point I &#8216;hit bottom&#8217;, at least when it comes to the art of harmony and juggling multiple independent melodic lines, which is what I like so much about Baroque counterpoint and Renaissance polyphony.  Gregorian chant is great, but it has a single vocal line.   The practice of using chords was first documented around 895: in a style called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organum">organum</a>, Gregorian chant was supplemented by either a supporting bass line, two parallel voices singing the melody, or both.   But the &#8216;Big Bang&#8217; of polyphony happened around 1170 when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p9WQlyVPrA">Léonin</a> introduced two independent melody lines.  Around 1200 his follower <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KA6oq_UYbyA">Pérotin</a> went ahead and started using three or four!  Imagine the dizzying sense of freedom these guys must have felt, with no precedents to guide them.</p>
<p>Medieval polyphony should be fascinating, and again it&#8217;s a huge territory: roughly two centuries, from 1200 to 1400.  But right now I seem to be focusing on Renaissance polyphony&#8212;and especially the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-Flemish_School">Franco-Flemish school</a>, which is an incredibly rich vein of music.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to say a lot about the Franco-Flemish school, but for now I just want to list a few of their best-known composers.   In fact, I&#8217;ll only mention one of each &#8216;generation&#8217;, and give you a sample of their music.</p>
<h4> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillaume_Du_Fay">Guillaume Dufay</a> (1397 &#8211; 1497)</h4>
<p>Dufay is the most famous of the first generation of the Franco-Flemish school.  (This first generation is also called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgundian_School">Burgundian School</a>.)  He is often considered a transitional figure from the medieval to the Renaissance.   His <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2021/04/23/dufays-isorhythmic-motets/">isorhythmic motets</a> illustrate that&#8212;their tonality is dissonant and dramatic compared to typical Renaissance polyphony:</p>
<div align="center">
<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JTIlHSouJYU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span></div>
<h4> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Ockeghem">Johannes  Ockeghem</a> (1410/1425 &#8211; 1495)</h4>
<p>Ockeghem is the most famous of the second generation of the Franco-Flemish school.  His innovations firmly moved this school out of the medieval into the world of Renaissance polyphony.  Some of his compositions are almost avant-garde in their structure&#8212;a mass that asks you to sing it in any of four modes, a mass where the different vocal lines are sung at different rates and drift out of synch&#8212;but they&#8217;re carried off so smoothly you might not notice.   People tend to call Ockeghem &#8220;the Bach of the 1400s&#8221;, which is sort of ridiculous because there&#8217;s just one J. S. Bach, but it gives a hint of his importance.  He was not a <i>prolific</i> composer, but he was also an honored singer, choirmaster, and teacher.</p>
<div align="center">
<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="460" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6K1jMnI1w2A?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span></div>
<h4> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josquin_des_Prez">Josquin de Prez</a> (~1450 &#8211; 1521)</h4>
<p>Josquin, of the third generation, is the real superstar of the Franco-Flemish school.  Luther wrote that &#8220;He is the master of the notes. They must do as he wills; as for the other composers, they have to do as the notes will.&#8221;  He was influenced by Ockeghem, and composed a motet in commemoration of Ockeghem&#8217;s death.  But he polished Ockeghem&#8217;s ideas and in some ways <i>simplified</i> them, making music that was easier to understand and more popular.  Despite being prolific and very influential, nothing is known of his personality, and the only known writing that may be in his own hand is a piece of graffiti on the wall of the Sistine Chapel.</p>
<div align="center">
<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="460" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dz-0ux7_aUQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span></div>
<h4> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Gombert">Nicholas Gombert</a> (1495 &#8211; 1460)</h4>
<p>Gombert is probably the most famous of the fourth generation of the Franco-Flemish school.  He wrote polyphonic masses and motets with as many as 6 separate melody lines, and sometimes with one voice imitating another after a very short time interval.  His work marks the height of complexity of the Franco-Flemish school.</p>
<div align="center">
<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="460" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HsCRLkqeI4I?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span></div>
<h4> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlande_de_Lassus">Orlande de Lassus</a> (1530 &#8211; 1594)</h4>
<p>Lassus, of the fifth generation of the Franco-Flemish school, is one of the composers of a style known as <i>musica reservata</i>&#8212;roughly, sophisticated and highly chromatic music.  But he also  wrote drinking songs in German, and one of his motets satirizes poor singers.  He wrote over 2,000 pieces of music, all vocal&#8212;none purely instrumental!   In the &#8220;The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans,&#8221; Sherlock Holmes said he was working on a monograph about the polyphonic motets of Lassus.</p>
<div align="center">
<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TKE2EMnWT_g?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span></div>
<p>So there you are: a microscopic overview of a musical tradition lasting over 200 years.</p>
<p>Maybe listing one just composer of each generation was a bad idea: I feel I&#8217;m doing an injustice to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilles_Binchois">Gilles Binchois</a> of the first generation, often considered the finest melodist of the 1400s, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Obrecht">Jacob Obrecht</a> of the third generation, who was the most famous composer of masses in the late 1400s before Josquin came along.  Obrecht was very adventurous: he often played melodies backwards (in retrograde), and once he even took the notes from a melody and played them in order of duration, long to short, to get a new melody.</p>
<p>There is also a lot going on in Renaissance polyphony outside the Franco-Flemish school!  There&#8217;s the British tradition, including great composers such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Byrd">William Byrd</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tallis">Thomas Tallis</a>.  And I haven&#8217;t even mentioned the most famous of all polyphonists: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Pierluigi_da_Palestrina">Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina</a>!   Or the most dissonant and in some ways the most intriguing of the lot: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Gesualdo">Carlo Gesualdo</a>.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s easy to get lost in unfamiliar territory, so I just wanted to give a quick outline of the Franco-Flemish school.  At the very least, listening to their music should be fun.</p>

				<h2><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2021/04/27/net-zero-carbon-emissions-a-trap/" rel="bookmark">Net Zero Carbon Emissions&#8212;A Trap?</a></h2>
				<small>27 April, 2021</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>You&#8217;ve got to read this article:</p>
<p>&bull; James Dyke, Robert Watson and Wolfgang Knorr, <a href="https://theconversation.com/climate-scientists-concept-of-net-zero-is-a-dangerous-trap-157368">Climate scientists: concept of net zero is a dangerous trap</a>, <i>The Conversation</i>, 22 April 2021.</p>
<p>By &#8220;net zero&#8221; they mean the idea that by cutting carbon emissions and introducing technologies that suck carbon dioxide from the air, we can reach net zero carbon emissions by around 2050 and stay below 1.5&deg; warming.</p>
<p>This idea is built into the Paris Agreement.   They&#8217;re saying this idea, especially the 2050 deadline, is mainly a way to keep business as usual going for a few more decades, to get politicians would sign the Paris Agreement.  And they&#8217;re saying it won&#8217;t really work, since we have no plausible scheme to suck enough carbon dioxide from the air.</p>
<p>I wrote earlier about how we could suck a lot of CO<sub>2</sub> from the air:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2020/01/12/can-we-fix-the-air/">Can we fix the air?</a></p>
<p>The heavy lifting in these schemes is done with plants.  Planting trees helps, and improving agriculture helps, but the National Academy of Sciences thinks creating biofuels and then capturing the CO<sub>2</sub> they emit when burned could be even bigger.  The acronym-loving experts call this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioenergy_with_carbon_capture_and_storage">BECCS</a>: bioenergy with carbon capture and storage.</p>
<p>Right now, people involved in the Paris Agreement tend to think our only hope is an &#8220;overshoot scenario&#8221; where we put shitloads of carbon dioxide into the air before 2050 and then suck it up later.   The authors of the article I want you to read say this is folly.</p>
<p>Who are these folks, anyway?   <a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/james-dyke-96221">James Dyke</a> is a senior lecturer in Global Systems at the University of Exeter.  <a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/robert-watson-1221654">Robert Watson</a> is a professor emeritus in Environmental Sciences at the University of East Anglia.  And <a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/wolfgang-knorr-823329">Wolfgang Knorr</a> is a senior research scientist in Physical Geography and Ecosystem Science at Lund University.</p>
<p>Since you may not read the link, even though the fate of civilization hangs in the balance, let me quote a chunk of what they say.</p>
<blockquote><p>
If we had acted on Hansen’s testimony [in 1988], we would have been able to decarbonise our societies at a rate of around 2% a year in order to give us about a two-in-three chance of limiting warming to no more than 1.5°C. It would have been a huge challenge, but the main task at that time would have been to simply stop the accelerating use of fossil fuels while fairly sharing out future emissions.</p>
<p>Four years later, there were glimmers of hope that this would be possible. During the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio, all nations agreed to stabilise concentrations of greenhouse gases to ensure that they did not produce dangerous interference with the climate. The 1997 Kyoto Summit attempted to start to put that goal into practice. But as the years passed, the initial task of keeping us safe became increasingly harder given the continual increase in fossil fuel use.</p>
<p>It was around that time that the first computer models linking greenhouse gas emissions to impacts on different sectors of the economy were developed. These hybrid climate-economic models are known as Integrated Assessment Models. They allowed modellers to link economic activity to the climate by, for example, exploring how changes in investments and technology could lead to changes in greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>They seemed like a miracle: you could try out policies on a computer screen before implementing them, saving humanity costly experimentation. They rapidly emerged to become key guidance for climate policy. A primacy they maintain to this day.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they also removed the need for deep critical thinking. Such models represent society as a web of idealised, emotionless buyers and sellers and thus ignore complex social and political realities, or even the impacts of climate change itself. Their implicit promise is that market-based approaches will always work. This meant that discussions about policies were limited to those most convenient to politicians: incremental changes to legislation and taxes.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure how much the problem is one of modeling.  It could be that if enough powerful people want to keep on with business as usual going, it&#8217;ll happen no matter what.  But we could argue that the modelers are complicit if they don&#8217;t speak out.  And indeed that&#8217;s one of the main points of this article!</p>
<p>Anyway, continuing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>    Around the time they were first developed, efforts were being made to secure US action on the climate by allowing it to count carbon sinks of the country’s forests. The US argued that if it managed its forests well, it would be able to store a large amount of carbon in trees and soil which should be subtracted from its obligations to limit the burning of coal, oil and gas. In the end, the US largely got its way. Ironically, the concessions were all in vain, since the US senate never ratified the agreement.</p>
<p>    Postulating a future with more trees could in effect offset the burning of coal, oil and gas now. As models could easily churn out numbers that saw atmospheric carbon dioxide go as low as one wanted, ever more sophisticated scenarios could be explored which reduced the perceived urgency to reduce fossil fuel use. By including carbon sinks in climate-economic models, a Pandora’s box had been opened.</p>
<p>    It’s here we find the genesis of today’s net zero policies.</p>
<p>    That said, most attention in the mid-1990s was focused on increasing energy efficiency and energy switching (such as the UK’s move from coal to gas) and the potential of nuclear energy to deliver large amounts of carbon-free electricity. The hope was that such innovations would quickly reverse increases in fossil fuel emissions.</p>
<p>    But by around the turn of the new millennium it was clear that such hopes were unfounded. Given their core assumption of incremental change, it was becoming more and more difficult for economic-climate models to find viable pathways to avoid dangerous climate change. In response, the models began to include more and more examples of carbon capture and storage, a technology that could remove the carbon dioxide from coal-fired power stations and then store the captured carbon deep underground indefinitely.</p>
<p>    This had been shown to be possible in principle: compressed carbon dioxide had been separated from fossil gas and then injected underground in a number of projects since the 1970s. These Enhanced Oil Recovery schemes were designed to force gases into oil wells in order to push oil towards drilling rigs and so allow more to be recovered&#8212;oil that would later be burnt, releasing even more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>    Carbon capture and storage offered the twist that instead of using the carbon dioxide to extract more oil, the gas would instead be left underground and removed from the atmosphere. This promised breakthrough technology would allow climate friendly coal and so the continued use of this fossil fuel. But long before the world would witness any such schemes, the hypothetical process had been included in climate-economic models. In the end, the mere prospect of carbon capture and storage gave policy makers a way out of making the much needed cuts to greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>    When the international climate change community convened in Copenhagen in 2009 it was clear that carbon capture and storage was not going to be sufficient for two reasons.</p>
<p>    First, it still did not exist. There were no carbon capture and storage facilities in operation on any coal fired power station and no prospect the technology was going to have any impact on rising emissions from increased coal use in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>    The biggest barrier to implementation was essentially cost. The motivation to burn vast amounts of coal is to generate relatively cheap electricity. Retrofitting carbon scrubbers on existing power stations, building the infrastructure to pipe captured carbon, and developing suitable geological storage sites required huge sums of money. Consequently the only application of carbon capture in actual operation then&#8212;and now&#8212;is to use the trapped gas in enhanced oil recovery schemes. Beyond a single demonstrator, there has never been any capture of carbon dioxide from a coal fired power station chimney with that captured carbon then being stored underground.</p>
<p>    Just as important, by 2009 it was becoming increasingly clear that it would not be possible to make even the gradual reductions that policy makers demanded. That was the case even if carbon capture and storage was up and running. The amount of carbon dioxide that was being pumped into the air each year meant humanity was rapidly running out of time.
</p></blockquote>
<p>So then people turned to another method&#8212;in theory, that is, not practice.  This was BECCS: bioenergy with carbon capture and storage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>    With hopes for a solution to the climate crisis fading again, another magic bullet was required. A technology was needed not only to slow down the increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, but actually reverse it. In response, the climate-economic modelling community – already able to include plant-based carbon sinks and geological carbon storage in their models – increasingly adopted the “solution” of combining the two.</p>
<p>    So it was that Bioenergy Carbon Capture and Storage, or BECCS, rapidly emerged as the new saviour technology. By burning “replaceable” biomass such as wood, crops, and agricultural waste instead of coal in power stations, and then capturing the carbon dioxide from the power station chimney and storing it underground, BECCS could produce electricity at the same time as removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. That’s because as biomass such as trees grow, they suck in carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. By planting trees and other bioenergy crops and storing carbon dioxide released when they are burnt, more carbon could be removed from the atmosphere.</p>
<p>    With this new solution in hand the international community regrouped from repeated failures to mount another attempt at reining in our dangerous interference with the climate. The scene was set for the crucial 2015 climate conference in Paris.</p>
<p>    As its general secretary brought the 21st United Nations conference on climate change to an end, a great roar issued from the crowd. People leaped to their feet, strangers embraced, tears welled up in eyes bloodshot from lack of sleep.</p>
<p>    The emotions on display on December 13, 2015 were not just for the cameras. After weeks of gruelling high-level negotiations in Paris a breakthrough had finally been achieved. Against all expectations, after decades of false starts and failures, the international community had finally agreed to do what it took to limit global warming to well below 2°C, preferably to 1.5°C, compared to pre-industrial levels.</p>
<p>    The Paris Agreement was a stunning victory for those most at risk from climate change. Rich industrialised nations will be increasingly impacted as global temperatures rise. But it’s the low lying island states such as the Maldives and the Marshall Islands that are at imminent existential risk. As a later UN special report made clear, if the Paris Agreement was unable to limit global warming to 1.5°C, the number of lives lost to more intense storms, fires, heatwaves, famines and floods would significantly increase.</p>
<p>    But dig a little deeper and you could find another emotion lurking within delegates on December 13. Doubt. We struggle to name any climate scientist who at that time thought the Paris Agreement was feasible. We have since been told by some scientists that the Paris Agreement was “of course important for climate justice but unworkable” and “a complete shock, no one thought limiting to 1.5°C was possible”. Rather than being able to limit warming to 1.5°C, a senior academic involved in the IPCC concluded we were heading beyond 3°C by the end of this century.</p>
<p>    Instead of confront our doubts, we scientists decided to construct ever more elaborate fantasy worlds in which we would be safe. The price to pay for our cowardice: having to keep our mouths shut about the ever growing absurdity of the required planetary-scale carbon dioxide removal.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The article goes on, but you get the point if you&#8217;ve read this far. Even the so-called experts on climate change are complicit in painting a rosy scenario about what will happen if we do what the Paris Agreement asks.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m interested to see if any climate scientists step up to argue against this article&#8212;or, for that matter, agree with it.</p>

				<small>23 April, 2021</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>I&#8217;ve been reading about Renaissance music.   People sometimes say that it began in the early 1400s when musicians rebelled against the dry, complicated mathematical structures of late medieval music and switched to a more emotionally expressive style.  For example, the <em>New Oxford History of Music</em> writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The isorhythmic motet, the highest achievement of medieval rationalism, reached its climax during Dufay’s prentice years (c. 1410-20), with works in which the quasi-mathematical construction arouses more admiration than pleasure.</p></blockquote>
<p>But since I&#8217;m a mathematician, this actually got me interested in isorhythmic motets!</p>
<p>I found them hard to understand from written descriptions.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isorhythm">Isorhythm</a> involves a rhythmic pattern called a <em>talea</em> which is applied to different melodies.  Often the <em>talea</em> lasts for a different amount of time than the melody, which leads to some interesting effects.  For example, here is a melody that lasts for 28 measures divided into 7 <em>talea</em> that each last for 4 measures:</p>

<p>This is from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messe_de_Nostre_Dame">composition written sometime around 1360</a>.   Isorhythm gets a lot more complicated than this!  The music typically has several parts, in which <i>talea</i> get sped up or slowed down independently. But reading about these things didn&#8217;t give me much of a feel for what isorhythmic motets actually sound like.</p>
<p>When I listened to some by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillaume_Du_Fay">Guillaume Dufay</a>, they didn&#8217;t sound dry at all!  For example:</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="450" height="254" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bq29_qdya88?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s quite thrilling and romantic, actually!  Listen to how he uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leading-tone">leading-tone</a>, the note one half a step below the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonic_(music)">tonic</a>, to build tension. This is a big medieval thing.  If you don&#8217;t know what the heck I&#8217;m talking about, wait to the very end of the piece!  Here Dufay clobbers us with a <em>loooong</em> leading-tone, the medieval equivalent of the wail of electric guitar at the end of a classic rock song.  He&#8217;s really hamming it up.</p>
<p>Now, Dufay is famous for being the first really major Renaissance composer and <em>breaking</em> from the medieval traditions, so maybe his isorhythmic motets are more exciting than average. But still, I hear they are intensely mathematical.</p>
<p>In fact there&#8217;s an album of Dufay&#8217;s isorhythmic motets with the great title <em><a href="http://www.glossamusic.com/glossa/reference.aspx?id=32">Quadrivium</a></em> which features a booklet by a mathematical physicist named <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Yup0LoEAAAAJ&amp;hl=no">Guido Magnano</a>, an expert on general relativity at the University of Turin.  On a <a href="http://www.mymusicbase.ru/PPS4/sd_4872.htm">Russian website</a> I read:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  This album by the Italian vocal-instrumental group Cantica Symphonia takes off from the proportional aspect of large Dufay works like the motet <em>Nuper rosarum flores</em>, long thought to have been based on the proportions of the great cathedral of Florence but recently discovered to have probably been modeled on another building. The album was actually sponsored by the mathematics department of the University of Turin, and an essay by professor Guido Magnano explores the mathematical bases of the musical system Dufay knew. For the average listener the musical manifestations of these principles are going to be hard to hear sitting in front of your stereo; the chief interpretive decision made by Cantica Symphonia is to strive for a transparent texture, judiciously using a small instrumental ensemble to bring out structural details. Save for the fact that the voice parts are sung solo, it&#8217;s a Renaissance performance in the classic &#8220;pure&#8221; mold. For the numerologically inclined or for the serious student of the Renaissance era, the disc is an interdisciplinary goldmine. Recorded in an Italian church, the disc matches its engineering to its aims, and the packaging by the Spanish label Glossa is uncommonly attractive.</p></blockquote>
<p>I decided I needed to get my hands on that booklet.   The album is on YouTube:</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="450" height="254" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v-PyHR7C7K8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span></p>
<p>Unfortunately the actual CD costs $47.53 on Amazon.  Luckily I was able to get it for much less online from Barnes and Noble&#8230; thereby procuring the booklet, which is what I really want.  This should arrive in a week or so, so with luck I&#8217;ll tell you more later.  I&#8217;m also quite fascinated by Dufay and the whole <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huelgas_Ensemble">Franco-Flemish school</a> of Renaissance music that he helped start, and&#8212;as usual when I&#8217;m just starting to learn about something&#8212;I have dreams of blogging about it.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I found out a bit from an <a href="http://www.glossamusic.com/glossa/context.aspx?Id=32">interview</a> with Guido Magnano, where he says this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <strong>Your first disc for Glossa, <em>Quadrivium</em>, placed special emphasis on the question of mathematical proportions in Dufay’s motets. If these considerations apply also to the works recorded here, can you provide some examples of how this came through in practice?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Guido Magnano:</strong> Mathematical proportions do not occur in medieval and Renaissance music as occasional, accessory stylistic elements: the Pythagorean-Platonic paradigm states that music itself is nothing but “auditory perception of numbers”. The hypothetical relationship between the mensural proportions of the motet <em>Nuper rosarum flores</em> and the proportions of Brunelleschi’s Duomo, although fascinating and quite plausible, should not obscure that in other motets, particularly in the later isorythmic motets (<em>Fulgens iubar</em> and <em>Moribus et genere</em>), Dufay attains an even higher degree of formal complexity.</p>
<p>The motet <em>Magnam me gentes</em>, (12:4:2:3) also included in this CD, has a mensural structure very close to <em>Nuper</em> (6:4:2:3). Worth noting is that the 15th century humanist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsilio_Ficino">Marsilio Ficino</a> introduced a “Platonic-Hermetic” movement, attributing occult significance to numerical relations. Did Dufay himself share these ideas? Do the numerical ratios in his motets hide a symbolic content? Some modern scholars have claimed so, even though the pieces for which numerological interpretations have been proposed were written some thirty years before Ficino’s works, and it is impossible to obtain a conclusive proof that such interpretations reflect Dufay’s intentions.</p>
<p>More concretely, one could ask to what extent mathematical proportions can be perceived by the listener. The “mensural proportions” (which are but one example of numerical ratios in this music) are merely changes of meter: in an isorhythmic motet, for instance, the basic sequence of note values (<em>talea</em>) is repeated with all durations multiplied by a fixed ratio (e.g. 2:1, 1:2 or 2:3). Whenever the change occurs simultaneously in all voices, it can be clearly heard; in other cases, it remains hidden in the polyphonic texture. The mensural proportions also determine the ratio of the lengths of the various sections of the piece, and the choice of appropriate proportions was considered to be essential to the overall structure of the piece, much as in the Pythagorean scale where such ratios (1:2, 2:3, …) determine the consonance of a chord. As Leibniz states three centuries later: “Music is the pleasure the human mind experiences from counting without being aware that it is counting.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Here is <em>Nuper rosarum flores</em> as played by Cantica Symphonia:</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="450" height="254" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_dV5b8AuLHg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span></p>
<p>This is the isorhythmic motet that Dufay wrote for the consecration of the cathedral in Florence in 1436, the one with Brunelleschi&#8217;s famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Cathedral#Dome">dome</a>.  He was 35 then, living in Florence and working for the Pope.  Later he would return to Cambrai, in what is now Northern France.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve visited this cathedral and taken the terrifying tour that lets you climb up to the dome, go <em>above</em> it into the rafters between the dome and roof, and then out onto the roof.   It&#8217;s an amazing structure:</p>

<p>For sheer joy, so far my favorite performance of Dufay&#8217;s isorhythmic motets is the album <em><a href="https://www.discogs.com/Guillaume-Dufay-Huelgas-Ensemble-Paul-Van-Nevel-O-Gemma-Lux/release/6749557">O gemma lux</a></em> by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huelgas_Ensemble">Huelgas Ensemble</a>:</p>

<p>To be honest, nobody is completely sure whether this is Guillaume Dufay or another famous composer of the early 1400s, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilles_Binchois">Gilles Binchois</a>.</p>

<p>A bunch of us are organizing a workshop on applications of category theory to robotics, as part of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation:</p>
<p>• <a href="https://idsc.ethz.ch/research-frazzoli/workshops/compositional-robotics.html">2021 Workshop on Compositional Robotics: Mathematics and Tools</a>, online, 31 May 2021.   Organized by Andrea Censi, Gioele Zardini, Jonathan Lorand, David Spivak, Brendan Fong, Nina Otter, Paolo Perrone, John Baez, Dylan Shell, Jason Kane, Alexandra Nilles, Andew Spielberg, and Emilio Frazzoli.</p>
<p>Submit your papers <a href="https://easychair.org/cfp/ICRA2021CRMT">here</a> by 21 May 2021!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the idea of the workshop:</p>
<p>In the last decade research on embodied intelligence has seen important developments. While the complexity of robotic systems has dramatically increased, both for single robots and interacting multi-robot systems (e.g., autonomous vehicles and mobility systems), the design methods have not kept up.</p>
<p>The standard answer to dealing with complexity is exploiting <b>compositionality</b>, but there are no well-established mathematical modeling and design tools that have the reach for compositional analysis and design at the level of a complex robotic system.</p>
<p>The goal of this workshop is to integrate mathematical principles and practical tools for <b>compositional robotics</b>, with a focus on applied category theory as a meta-language to talk about compositionality.</p>
<p>The workshop will happen on May 31st virtually. Details will follow.</p>
<h4>Session I: Mathematics and Tools for Compositionality</h4>
<p>In the morning, some of the world&#8217;s leading experts in Applied Category Theory (ACT) will provide tutorials to present an invitation to various aspects of compositionality, both at the theoretical and the practical level. In particular, Dr. Jonathan Lorand will teach Category Theory basics, Dr. David Spivak and Dr. Brendan Fong will introduce the audience to the concept of compositionality, Prof. John Baez will explain how the previously defined concepts can be used when modeling various types of systems, and Dr. Andrea Censi will present the theory of co-design, tailored to robotic applications.</p>
<h4>Session II: Keynote Talks and Open Contributions</h4>
<p>The afternoon session features two keynotes on the application of compositionality in robotics:</p>
<p>• Prof. Aaron Ames, Bren Professor of Mechanical and Civil Engineering and Control and Dynamical Systems, California Institute of Technology.</p>
<p>• Prof. Daniel Koditschek, Alfred Fitler Moore Professor of Electrical &amp; Systems Engineering, School of Engineering &amp; Applied Science, University of Pennsylvania. Prof. Koditschek will be assisted by Dr. Paul Gustafson (Wright State University) and Dr. Matthew Kvalheim (University of Pennsylvania).</p>
<p>Both speakers are leading experts in their fields and have succesfully applied category theory and compositionality to real challenges in robotics. Finally, we plan for eight talk-slots for open submissions. Submissions should focus on mathematical perspectives (not limited to ACT) and applications of compositionality.</p>

<p>&#036;latex  E = mc^2&#036;</p>
<p>You need the word 'latex' right after the first dollar sign, and it needs a space after it.  Double dollar signs don't work, and other limitations apply, some described <a href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/latex/">here</a>.  You can't preview comments here, but I'm happy to fix errors.</p>
