<p>I haven&#8217;t spoken much about the <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/?s=azimuth+backup">Azimuth Climate Data Backup Project</a>, but it&#8217;s going well, and I&#8217;ll be speaking about it soon, here:</p>
<p>• <a href="https://library.ucr.edu/about/news/library-to-host-open-access-week-2017">International Open Access Week</a>, Wednesday 25 October 2017, 9:30&#8211;11:00 a.m., University of California, Riverside, Orbach Science Library, Room 240.</p>
<blockquote><p>
“Open in Order to Save Data for Future Research” is the 2017 event theme.</p>
<p>Open Access Week is an opportunity for the academic and research community to learn about the potential benefits of sharing what they’ve learned with colleagues, and to help inspire wider participation in helping to make “open access” a new norm in scholarship, research and data planning and preservation.</p>
<p>The Open Access movement is made of up advocates (librarians, publishers, university repositories, etc.) who promote the free, immediate, and online publication of research.</p>
<p>The program will provide information on issues related to saving open data, including climate change and scientific data. The panelists also will describe open access projects in which they have participated to save climate data and to preserve end-of-term presidential data, information likely to be and utilized by the university community for research and scholarship.</p>
<p>The program includes:</p>
<p>• Brianna Marshall, Director of Research Services, UCR Library: Brianna welcomes guests and introduces panelists.</p>
<p>• John Baez, Professor of Mathematics, UCR: John will describe his activities to save US government climate data through his collaborative effort, the Azimuth Climate Data Backup Project.  All of the saved data is now open access for everyone to utilize for research and scholarship.  </p>
<p>• Perry Willett, Digital Preservation Projects Manager, California Digital Library: Perry will discuss the open data initiatives in which CDL participates, including the end-of-term presidential web archiving that is done in partnership with the Library of Congress, Internet Archive and University of North Texas.</p>
<p>• Kat Koziar, Data Librarian, UCR Library: Kat will give an overview of DASH, the UC system data repository, and provide suggestions for researchers interested in making their data open.</p>
<p>This will be the eighth International Open Access Week program hosted by the UCR Library.</p>
<p>The event is free and open to the public. Light refreshments will be served.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>The <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/azimuth_backup_project/">Azimuth Climate Data Backup Project</a> is going well!  Our <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/592742410/azimuth-climate-data-backup-project">Kickstarter campaign</a> ended on January 31st and the money has recently reached us.  Our original goal was $5000.  We got $20,427 of donations, and after Kickstarter took its cut we received $18,590.96.</p>
<p>Next time I&#8217;ll tell you what our project has actually been doing.  This time I just want to give a huge &#8220;thank you!&#8221; to all 627 people who contributed money on Kickstarter!</p>
<p>I sent out thank you notes to everyone, updating them on our progress and asking if they wanted their names listed.  The blanks in the following list represent people who either didn&#8217;t reply, didn&#8217;t want their names listed, or backed out and decided not to give money.  I&#8217;ll list people in chronological order: first contributors first.</p>
<p>Only 12 people backed out; the vast majority of blanks on this list are people who haven&#8217;t replied to my email.  I noticed some interesting but obvious patterns.  For example, people who contributed later are less likely to have answered my email yet&#8212;I&#8217;ll update this list later.   People who contributed more money were more likely to answer my email.</p>
<p>The magnitude of contributions ranged from $2000 to $1.  A few people offered to help in other ways.  The response was international&#8212;this was really heartwarming!   People from the US were more likely than others to ask not to be listed.</p>
<p>But instead of continuing to list statistical patterns, let me just <em>thank</em> everyone who contributed.</p>

<p>Along with the <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2017/01/21/saving-climate-data-part-4/">bad news</a> there is some good news:</p>
<p>• Over 380 people have pledged over $14,000 to the Azimuth Backup Project <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/592742410/azimuth-climate-data-backup-project">on Kickstarter</a>, greatly surpassing our conservative initial goal of $5,000.</p>
<p>• Given our budget, we currently aim at backing up 40 terabytes of data, and we are well on our way to this goal.  You can see what we&#8217;ve done at <a href="https://bitbucket.org/azimuth-backup/azimuth-inventory/wiki/Our%20progress">Our Progress</a>, and what we&#8217;re still doing at the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/azimuth-backup/azimuth-inventory/issues">Issue Tracker</a>.</p>
<p>•  I have gotten a commitment from Danna Gianforte, the head of Computing and Communications at U. C. Riverside, that eventually the university will maintain a copy of our data.  (This commitment is based on my earlier estimate that we&#8217;d have 20 terabytes of data, so I need to see if 40 is okay.)</p>
<p>•  I have gotten two offers from other people, saying they too can hold our data.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m hoping that the data at U. C. Riverside will be made publicly available through a server.  The other offers may involve it being held &#8216;secretly&#8217; until such time as it became needed; that has its own complementary advantages.</p>
<p>However, the interesting problem that confronts us now is: how to spend our money?</p>
<p>You can see how we&#8217;re currently spending it on our <a href="https://bitbucket.org/azimuth-backup/azimuth-inventory/wiki/Budget%20and%20spending">Budget and Spending</a> page.  Basically, we&#8217;re paying a firm called Hetzner for servers and storage boxes.</p>
<p>We could simply continue to do this until our money runs out.  I hope that long before then, U. C. Riverside will have taken over some responsibilities.  If so, there would be a long period where our money would largely pay for a redundant backup.  Redundancy is good, but perhaps there is something better.</p>
<p>Two members of our team, Sakari Maaranen and Greg Kochanski, have thoughts on this matter which I&#8217;d like to share.   Sakari posted his thoughts <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+SakariMaaranen/posts/eosKpFG6h2F">on Google+</a>, while Greg  posted his in an email which he&#8217;s letting me share here.</p>
<p>Please read these and offer us your thoughts!   Maybe you can help us decide on the best strategy!</p>
<h3> Sakari Maaranen </h3>
<p>For the record, my views on our strategy of using the budget that the <b>Azimuth Climate Data Backup Project</b> now has.</p>
<p>People have contributed it to this effort specifically.</p>
<p>Some non-government entities have offered &#8220;free hosting&#8221;. Of course the project should take any and all free offers to host our data. Those would not be spending our budget however. And they are still paying for it, even if they offered it to us &#8220;for free&#8221;.</p>
<p>As far as it comes to spending, I think we should think in terms of 1) terabytemonths, and 2) sufficient redundancy, and do that as cost-efficiently as possible. We should not just dump the money to any takers, but think of the best bang for the buck. We owe that to the people who have contributed now.</p>
<p>For example, if we burn the cash quick to expensive storage, I would consider that a failure. Instead, we must plan for the best use of the budget towards our mission.</p>
<p>What we have promised to the people is that we back up and serve these data sets, by the money they have given to us. Let&#8217;s do exactly that.</p>
<p>We are currently serving the mission at approximately €0.006 per gigabytemonth at least for as long as we have volunteers to work for free. The cost could be slightly higher if we paid for professional maintenance, which should be a reasonable assumption if we plan for long term service. Volunteer work cannot be guaranteed forever, even if it works temporarily.</p>
<p><i>This is one view and the question is open to public discussion.﻿</i></p>
<h3> Greg Kochanski </h3>
<p>Some misc thoughts.</p>
<p>1) As I see it, we have made some promise of serving the data (&#8220;create a better interface for getting it&#8221;) which can be an expensive thing.</p>
<p>UI coding isn&#8217;t all that easy, and takes some time.</p>
<p>Beyond that, we&#8217;ve promised to back up the data, and once you say &#8220;backup&#8221;, you&#8217;ve also made an implicit promise to make the data available.</p>
<p>2) I agree that if we have a backup, it is a logical extension to take continuous backups, but I wouldn&#8217;t say it&#8217;s necessary.</p>
<p>Perhaps the way to think about it is to ask the question, &#8220;what do our donors likely want&#8221;?</p>
<p>3) Clearly they want to preserve the data, in case it disappears from the Federal sites.   So, that&#8217;s job 1.   And, if it does disappear, we need to make it available.</p>
<p>3a) Making it available will require some serving CPU, disk, and network.  We may need to worry about DDOS attacks, thought perhaps we could get free coverage from Akamai or Google Project Shield.</p>
<p>3b) Making it available may imply paying some students to write Javascript and HTML to put up a front-end to allow people to access the data we are collecting.</p>
<p>Not all the data we&#8217;re collecting is in strictly servable form.   Some of the databases, for example aren&#8217;t usefully servable in the form we collect, and we know some links will be broken because of missing pages, or because of wget&#8217;s design flaw.*</p>
<p>[* Wget stores <a href="http://a/b/c" rel="nofollow">http://a/b/c</a> as a file, a/b/c, where a/b is a directory.    Wget stores <a href="http://a/b" rel="nofollow">http://a/b</a> as a file a/b, where a/b is a file.</p>
<p>Therefore, both cannot exist simultaneously on disk.  If they do, wget drops one.]</p>
<p>Points 3 &amp; 3a imply that we need to keep some money in the bank until either the websites are taken down, or we decide that the threat has abated.  So, we need to figure out how much money to keep as a serving reserve.  It doesn&#8217;t sound like UCR has committed to serve the data, though you could perhaps ask.</p>
<p>Beyond the serving reserve, I think we are free to do better backups (i.e. more than one data collection), and change detection.</p>

<p>I want to list some databases that are particularly worth backing up.  But to do this, we need to know what&#8217;s already been backed up.  That&#8217;s what this post is about.</p>
<h3> Azimuth backups </h3>
<p>Here is information as of now (21:45 GMT 20 December 2016).  I won&#8217;t update this information.   For up-to-date information see</p>
<p>• <a href="https://bitbucket.org/azimuth-backup/azimuth-inventory/issues">Azimuth Backup Project: Issue Tracker</a>.</p>
<p>For up-to-date information on the progress of each of individual databases listed below, click on my summary of what&#8217;s happening now.</p>
<p>Here are the databases that we&#8217;ve backed up:</p>

<h3> Other backups </h3>
<p>Other backups are listed at</p>
<p>•  <a href="https://climate.daknob.net/">The Climate Mirror Project, https://climate.daknob.net/</a>.</p>
<p>This nicely provides the sizes of various backups, and other useful information.  Some are &#8216;signed and verified&#8217; with cryptographic keys, but I&#8217;m not sure exactly what that means, and the details matter.</p>
<p>About 90 databases are listed here, along with some size information and some information about whether people have already backed them up or are in process:</p>

<p>This blog page is to help organize the <strong>Azimuth Environmental Data Backup Project</strong>, or <strong>Azimuth Backup Project</strong> for short.  This is part of the larger but decentralized, frantic and somewhat disorganized project discussed elsewhere:</p>
<p>• <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2016/12/16/saving-climate-data-part-2/">Saving Climate Data (Part 2)</a>, <em>Azimuth</em>, 15 December 2016.</p>
<p>Here I&#8217;ll just say what we&#8217;re doing at Azimuth.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Jan+Galkowski">Jan Galkowski</a> is a statistician and engineer at Akamai Technologies, a company in Cambridge Massachusetts whose content delivery network is one of the world&#8217;s largest distributed computing platforms, responsible for serving at least 15% of all web traffic.  He has begun copying some of the publicly accessible US government climate databases.  On 11 December he wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  John, so I have just started trying to mirror all of CDIAC [the <a href="http://cdiac.ornl.gov/">Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center</a>]. We&#8217;ll see. I&#8217;ll put it in a tarball, and then throw it up on Google. It should keep everything intact. Using WinHTTrack. I have coordinated with <a href="https://twitter.com/EricHolthaus/with_replies">Eric Holthaus</a> via Twitter, creating, per your suggestion, a new personal account which I am using exclusively to follow the principals.</p>
<p>  Once CDIAC is done, and checked over, I&#8217;ll move on to other sites.</p>
<p>  There are things beyond our control, such as paper records, or records which are online but are not within visibility of the public.</p>
<p>  Oh, and I&#8217;ve formally requested time off from work for latter half of December so I can work this on vacation. (I have a number of other projects I want to work in parallel, anyway.)
</p></blockquote>
<p>By 14 December he was wanting some more storage space.  He asked <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/David+Tanzer">David Tanzer</a> and me:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Do either of you have a large Google account, or the &#8220;unlimited storage&#8221; option at Amazon?</p>
<p>  I&#8217;m using WebDrive, a commercial product.  What I&#8217;m (now) doing is defining an FTP map at a .gov server, and then a map to my Amazon Cloud Drive. I&#8217;m using Windows 7, so these appear as standard drives (or mounts, in *nix terms). I navigate to an appropriate place on the Amazon Drive, and then I proceed to copy from .gov to Amazon.</p>
<p>  There is no compression, and, in order to be sure I don&#8217;t abuse the .gov site, I&#8217;m deliberately passing this over a wireless network in my home, which limits the transfer rate.  If necessary, and if the .gov site permits, I could hardwire the workstation to our FIOS router and get appreciably faster transfer. (I often do that for large work files.)</p>
<p>  The nice thing is I get to work from home 3 days a week, so I can keep an eye on this.  And I&#8217;m taking days off just to do this.</p>
<p>  I&#8217;m thinking about how I might get a second workstation in the act.</p>
<p>  The Web sites themselves I&#8217;m downloading, as mentioned, using HTTrack. I intended to tarball-up the site structure and then upload to Amazon. I&#8217;m still working on CDIAC at ORNL. For future sites, I&#8217;m going to try to get HTTrack to mirror directly to Amazon using one of the mounts.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I asked around for more storage space, and my request was kindly answer by <a href="https://plus.google.com/+ScottMaxwell/about">Scott Maxwell</a>.  Scott lives in Pasadena California and he used to work for NASA: he even had a job driving a Mars rover! He is now a site reliability engineer at Google, and he works on Google Drive.  Scott is setting up a 10-terabyte account on Google Drive, which Jan and others will be able to use.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jan noticed some interesting technical problems: for some reason WebDrive is barely using the capacity of his network connection, so things are moving much more slowly than they could in theory.</p>
<p>Most recently, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+SakariMaaranen/about">Sakari Maaranen</a> offered his assistance.  Sakari is a systems architect at Ubisecure, a firm in Finland that specializes in identity management, advanced user authentication, authorization, single sign-on, and federation.  He wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I have several terabytes worth in Helsinki (can get more) and a gigabit connection. I registered my offer but they [the DataRefuge people] didn&#8217;t reply though. I&#8217;m glad if that means you have help already and don&#8217;t need a copy in Helsinki.﻿
</p></blockquote>
<p>I replied saying that the absence of a reply probably means that they&#8217;re overwhelmed by offers of help and are struggling to figure out exactly what to do.  Scott said:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Hey, Sakari! Thank you for the generous offer!</p>
<p>  I&#8217;m setting these guys up with Google Drive storage, as at least a short-term solution.</p>
<p>  IMHO, our first order of business is just to get a copy of the data into a location we control&#8212;one that can&#8217;t easily be taken away from us. That&#8217;s the rationale for Google Drive: it fits into Jan&#8217;s existing workflow, so it&#8217;s the lowest-friction path to getting a copy of the data that&#8217;s under our control.</p>
<p>  How about if I propose this: we let Jan go ahead with the plan of backing up the data in Drive. Then I&#8217;ll look evaluate moving it from there to whatever other location we come up with. (Or copying instead of moving! More copies is better. :-) How does that sound to you?</p>
<p>  I admit I haven&#8217;t gotten as far as thinking about Web serving at all&#8212;and it&#8217;s not my area of expertise anyway. Maybe you&#8217;d be kind enough to elaborate on your thoughts there.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Sakari responded with some information about servers.  In late January, U. C. Riverside may help me with this&#8212;until then they are busy trying to get more storage space, for wholly unrelated reasons.  But right now it seems the main job is to identify important data and get it under our control.</p>
<p>There are a lot of ways you could help.</p>
<p>• <b>Computer skills.</b>  Personally I&#8217;m not much use with anything technical about computers, but the rest of the Azimuth Data Backup gang probably has technical questions that some of you out there could answer&#8230; so, I encourage discussion of those questions.  (Clearly some discussions are best done privately, and at some point we may encounter unfriendly forces, but this is a good place for roaming experts to answer questions.)</p>
<p>• <b>Security.</b>  Having a backup of climate data is not very useful if there are also fake databases floating around and you can&#8217;t prove yours is authentic.  How can we create a kind of digital certificate that our database matches what was on a specific website at a specific time?  We should do this if someone here has the expertise.</p>
<p>• <b>Money.</b>  If we wind up wanting to set up a permanent database with a nice front end, accessible from the web, we may want money.  We could do a Kickstarter campaign.  People may be more interested in giving money now than later, unless the political situation immediately gets worse after January 20th.</p>
<p>• <b>Strategy.</b>  We should talk a bit about what to do next, though too much talk tends to prevent action.  Eventually, if all goes well, our homegrown effort will be overshadowed by others, at least in sheer quantity.  About 3 hours ago Eric Holthaus <a href="https://twitter.com/EricHolthaus/status/809543323388026880">tweeted</a> &#8220;we just got a donation of several petabytes&#8221;.  If it becomes clear that others are putting together huge, secure databases with nice front ends, we can either quit or&#8212;better&#8212;cooperate with them, and specialize on something we&#8217;re good at and enjoy.</p>

				<small>27 January, 2011</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>Hi, I’m Curtis Faith. I’m very excited to be helping with the Azimuth Project.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I read John’s exhortation for blog readers to join in the discussion on the Azimuth Forum, so I decided to check it out. I was surprised at the amount of work that has been done in the last six months. I was inspired by the project’s goals and decided to commit to helping.</p>
<p>Since we need help, and hope that other blog readers might pitch in to help too, John and I thought it would be a good idea for me to explain a little about myself, why I think the Azimuth Project is so important, and how I think I can help.</p>
<p>I just turned 47 on Sunday. I am a first-time father with a 9-month old daughter. She is amazing. I don’t want her to grow up and wonder why our generation let things get so bad and I didn’t do anything to help make the world better.</p>
<p>I’m a real optimist by nature. But ignoring the very clear trends of the last 30 to 40 years is no longer an option. Our generation must stand up and do something about this.</p>
<p>A few years back I thought that politics might be the answer. I spent a lot of time learning the ins and outs of politics. My wife and I even followed the 2008 U.S. election and filmed the campaigns of Obama and Ron Paul in the process of learning. It is clear to me—having seen the way the last few years have unfolded—that political solutions will not avert the coming crisis.</p>
<p>In the last few years, my wife and I have lived in southeast Asia for 4 months, and in South America for a few years. I wanted to get to understand the world from outside the U.S. perspective. To get to know people in other countries as individuals, as humans. This has made it even more clear what the major problems are, and that the solutions won’t be implemented until a major crisis strikes.</p>
<p>So I’ve been working on learning relevant technology and science for the last few years as a backup plan. Trying to see where I might be able to help out in the most effective way possible. I have also spent a lot of time investigating the various other efforts working on the major global problems. None of them appear to me to be facing reality. In contrast, the Azimuth Project fits what I’ve seen with my own eyes.</p>
<p>But most of all, the reason that I’m excited about the Azimuth Project is that it has the loftiest of goals and the Earth needs saving. We’ve screwed it up and we’re running out of time.</p>
<p><strong>A bit about me</strong></p>
<p>I’m best known for something that started 27 years ago, in the fall of 1983, when I was just 19 years old.</p>
<p>I dropped out of college because I was bored and joined a small group of traders who later became famous in the trading world because of our subsequent success and how we learned to trade. Some of the lessons I learned in that group about managing risk and uncertainty are very relevant to the Azimuth Project goals for saving the world.</p>
<p>A famous Chicago trader, Richard Dennis, took out large ads in the New York Times, Barrons, and the Wall Street Journal announcing trainee positions. After only two weeks of training we were given money to trade and at the end of the first month of practice with a small account, I was given a $2 million account to trade. Over the next 4 plus years, I turned that $2 million into more than $33 million, more than doubling the money each year. Most of the other trainees were also successful and this story became legend in trading circles as the group made more than $100 million for Richard during the life of the program. Our group was known as the Turtles and I wrote a book about this experience, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/007148664X"><em>Way of the Turtle</em></a>, that became a bestseller in finance a few years back.</p>
<p>After Rich disbanded the Turtles, I got bored with trading. I was more interested in software and wanted to do something to make the world a better place. I started a few companies, built innovative software, tried to solve challenging problems and eventually found my way to Silicon Valley at the latter half of the Internet Boom.</p>
<p><strong>Chaos, and risk and uncertainty</strong></p>
<p>The sheer complexity of the issues and the scope of the problems that endanger the planet and life on it ensure that there will never be enough information to make a “correct” analysis. Except in the very broadest terms, we can’t know what the future will bring so we need to build plans that acknowledge that very real limitation.</p>
<p>We could pretend that we know more than is possible to know, or we can embrace the uncertainty and adapt to it. If we do this, we can concentrate on building flexibility and responsiveness along with an ability to assimilate and acquire an understanding of reality as it unfolds.</p>
<p>As a trader and entrepreneur, I learned about managing risk and uncertainty and how to develop flexible plans that will work when you can’t predict the future. Over time I came to see that other professionals who were forced to plan and make decisions under conditions of uncertainty used similar strategies.</p>
<p>But first, some background. While in Silicon Valley, I met a couple of guys who were forming a new hedge fund in the Virgin Islands, Simon Olsen and Bruce Tizes. In early 2001, it was obvious to most people that the Internet party was over in Silicon Valley. Pink slips were flying everywhere. So I thought it might be a good time to do something new for a few years.</p>
<p>I had often thought about getting back into trading so I could build up enough money to fund my own projects. I didn’t like the way that all the funding in software was focused on money. Most investors didn’t care about building cool software, and certainly not about doing positive things for the world. If those things came, they were secondary to profits. So for a while I thought it best to go make my own money. So I wouldn’t be restricted to only those strategies which optimized profits for investors.</p>
<p>So I decided to join Bruce and Simon in their hedge fund venture, and Bruce and I subsequently became good friends. Bruce had a very interesting background. He is one of the rare true polymaths that I’ve run into. He is incredibly bright, with a very flexible mind. He graduated high school at 15 years of age, college at 16, and medical school at 20. He later made a lot of money investing in real estate and trading stocks.</p>
<p>For most of the time since he had become a doctor, Bruce had been practicing emergency medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in Chicago. Mount Sinai is the inspiration for the television series E.R. that also takes place in Chicago and is a major destination for accident and gunshot victims in the downtown Chicago area.</p>
<p>So in various discussions over lunch or dinner over the few years we worked together, I came to learn a bit about the life of an emergency room doctor. Over time, Bruce showed me that there were similarities in how ER doctors and traders approached risk and uncertainty.</p>
<p>From my experience with software entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, I knew that they too handle risks and uncertainty in similar ways. It seemed like everyone who was forced to deal with uncertainty in the normal course of business followed similar general principles, and that these principles would be very useful even for those who didn’t learn them on the job.</p>
<p>Since my first book sold very well, the publisher was interested in getting me to write another book. I agreed to write one. But this time I wanted to write a book about these important principles for managing risk and uncertainty rather than a trading book.</p>
<p>This became my second book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Inside-Mind-Turtles-Worlds-Traders/dp/0071602437/"><em>Inside the Mind of the Turtles</em></a>. Unfortunately, against my wishes and better judgment, it was marketed as a trading book. The truth is that it is a much more general book written for times of chaos and uncertainty, even for the emergency room doctors for a planet in peril. It contains ideas that are very relevant to the Azimuth Project.</p>
<p>In my next post here, I’ll outline the Seven Rules for Risk I develop in the book and show how they are relevant for the Azimuth Project because of the tremendous uncertainty inherent in environmental and sustainability issues.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I urge you to join in and help with the Azimuth Project. Read some articles in the <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Azimuth+Library">Azimuth Library</a> and join the discussions on the related <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Azimuth+Forum">Azimuth Forum</a>.</p>
<p>The Azimuth Project is multidisciplinary so there are opportunities for all different kinds of people to help out. For example, I have been interested in low-energy transportation alternatives. So I plan on doing more research, adding to the Azimuth library of articles for advanced transportation, and finding some of the best experts to see if they will help on the Azimuth Project itself. I am also good at simplifying and explaining complicated problems. So I plan to take some of the more complicated sustainability issues and summarize them for non-experts. This will make it easier for people of diverse talents to grasp the full scope of the problems Azimuth is tackling.</p>
<p>I’ve spent much of the last 10 years trying to figure out how I can best help make the world a better place.</p>
<p>For me, the Azimuth Project is that answer. Come check it out.</p>

				<small>21 January, 2017</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>At noon today in Washington DC, while Trump was being inaugurated, all mentions of &#8220;climate change&#8221; and &#8220;global warming&#8221; were eliminated from the White House website.</p>
<p>Well, not all. The word &#8220;climate&#8221; still shows up here:</p>
<blockquote><p>
President Trump is committed to eliminating harmful and unnecessary policies such as the Climate Action Plan&#8230;.
</p></blockquote>
<p>There are also reports that all mentions of climate change will be scrubbed from the website of the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA.</p>
<h3> From <i>Motherboard</i> </h3>
<p>Let me quote from this article:</p>
<p>• Jason Koebler, <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/read/all-references-to-climate-change-have-been-deleted-from-the-white-house-website">All references to climate change have been deleted from the White House website</a>, <em>Motherboard</em>, 20 January 2017.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Scientists and professors around the country had been rushing to <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/researchers-are-preparing-for-trump-to-delete-government-science-from-the-web">download and rehost as much government science</a> as was possible before the transition, based on a fear that Trump’s administration would neglect or outright delete government information, databases, and web applications about science. Last week, the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/radio-motherboard/id946704646?mt=2">Radio Motherboard podcast</a> recorded an episode about these efforts, which you can listen to below, or anywhere you listen to podcasts.</p>
<p>  The Internet Archive, too, has been keeping a close watch on the White House website; President Obama’s climate change page had been archived every single day in January.</p>
<p>  So far, nothing on the Environmental Protection Agency’s website has changed under Trump, but <a href="https://insideepa.com/daily-news/trump-transition-preparing-scrub-some-climate-data-epa-website">a report earlier this week from <em>Inside EPA</em></a>, a newsletter and website that reports on the agency, suggested that pages about climate are destined to be cut within the first few weeks of his presidency.</p>
<p>  Scientists I’ve spoken to who are archiving websites say they expect scientific data on the NASA, NOAA, Department of Energy, and EPA websites to be neglected or deleted eventually. They say they don’t expect agency sites to be updated immediately, but expect it to play out over the course of months. This sort of low-key data destruction might not be the type of censorship people typically think about, but scientists are treating it as such.
</p></blockquote>
<h3> From <i>Technology Review</i> </h3>
<p>Greg Egan pointed out another good article, on MIT&#8217;s magazine:</p>
<p>• James Temple, <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603402/climate-data-preservation-efforts-mount-as-trump-takes-office/?set=603410">Climate data preservation efforts mount as Trump takes office</a>, <em>Technology Review</em>, 20 January 2010.</p>
<p>Quoting from that:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Dozens of computer science students at the University of California, Los Angeles, will mark Inauguration Day by downloading federal climate databases they fear could vanish under the Trump Administration.</p>
<p>  Friday&#8217;s hackathon follows a series of grassroots data preservation efforts in recent weeks, amid increasing concerns the new administration is filling agencies with climate deniers likely eager to cut off access to scientific data that undermine their policy views. Those worries only grew earlier this week, when <em>Inside EPA</em> <a href="https://insideepa.com/daily-news/trump-transition-preparing-scrub-some-climate-data-epa-website">reported</a> website that the Environmental Protection Agency transition team plans to scrub climate data from the agency&#8217;s website, citing a source familiar with the team.</p>
<p>  Earlier federal data hackathons include the &#8220;<a href="https://technoscienceunit.wordpress.com/2016/12/04/guerrilla-archiving-event-saving-environmental-data-from-trump/">Guerrilla Archiving</a>&#8221; event at the University of Toronto last month, the Internet Archive&#8217;s <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2017/01/02/join-us-for-a-white-house-social-media-and-gov-data-hackathon/">Gov Data Hackathon</a> in San Francisco at the beginning of January, and the <a href="http://www.ppehlab.org/datarefugephilly/">DataRescue Philly</a> event at the University of Pennsylvania last week.</p>
<p>  Much of the collected data is being stored in the servers of the <a href="http://eotarchive.cdlib.org/">End of Term Web Archive</a>, a collaborative effort to preserve government websites at the conclusion of presidential terms. The University of Pennsylvania&#8217;s Penn Program in Environmental Humanities launched the separate <a href="http://www.ppehlab.org/datarefuge">DataRefuge project</a>, in part to back up environmental data sets that standard Web crawling tools can&#8217;t collect.</p>
<p>  Many of the groups are working off a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12-__RqTqQxuxHNOln3H5ciVztsDMJcZ2SVs1BrfqYCc/edit#gid=199328709">master list</a> of crucial data sets from NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. Geological Survey, and other agencies. Meteorologist and climate journalist <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/12/13/why-im-trying-to-preserve-federal-climate-data-before-trump-takes-office/?utm_term=.d909c8d53dcc">Eric Holthaus</a> helped prompt the creation of that crowdsourced list with a <a href="https://twitter.com/EricHolthaus/status/807802102416228352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">tweet</a> early last month.</p>
<p>  Other key developments driving the archival initiatives included reports that the transition team had <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/12/09/trump-transition-team-for-energy-department-seeks-names-of-employees-involved-in-climate-meetings/?utm_term=.85444dbd120f">asked Energy Department officials</a> for a list of staff who attended climate change meetings in recent years, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/22/nasa-earth-donald-trump-eliminate-climate-change-research">public statements</a> from senior campaign policy advisors arguing that NASA should get out of the business of “<a href="http://spacenews.com/trumps-space-policy-reaches-for-mars-and-the-stars/">politically correct environmental monitoring</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>  &#8220;The transition team has given us no reason to believe that they will respect scientific data, particularly when it&#8217;s inconvenient,&#8221; says Gretchen Goldman, research director in the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists. These historical databases are crucial to ongoing climate change research in the United States and abroad, she says.</p>
<p>  To be clear, the Trump camp hasn&#8217;t publicly declared plans to erase or eliminate access to the databases. But there is certainly precedent for state and federal governments editing, removing, or downplaying scientific information that doesn&#8217;t conform to their political views.</p>
<p>  Late last year, it <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/endangered-species-under-gop-climate-change-information-on-the-web">emerged</a> that text on Wisconsin&#8217;s Department of Natural Resources website was substantially rewritten to remove references to climate change. In addition, an extensive Congressional investigation <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/white-house-editing-scientists/">concluded</a> in a 2007 report that the Bush Administration &#8220;engaged in a systematic effort to <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/white-house-editing-scientists/">manipulate</a> climate change science and mislead policymakers and the public about the dangers of global warming.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>In fact these Bush Administration efforts were masterminded by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/12/science/myron-ebell-trump-epa.html">Myron Ebell</a>, who Trump chose to lead his EPA transition team!</p>
<p>Continuing:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  In fact, there are wide-ranging changes to federal websites with every change in administration for a variety of reasons. The Internet Archive, which collaborated on the End of Term project in 2008 and 2012 as well, notes that more than 80 percent of PDFs on .gov sites <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2016/12/15/preserving-u-s-government-websites-and-data-as-the-obama-term-ends/">disappeared</a> during that four-year period.</p>
<p>  The organization has seen a surge of interest in backing up sites and data this year across all government agencies, but particularly for climate information. In the end, they expect to collect well more than 100 terabytes of data, close to triple the amount in previous years, says Jefferson Bailey, director of Web archiving.
</p></blockquote>
<p>In fact the Azimuth Backup Project alone may gather about 40 terabytes!</p>
<h3> From <i>Inside EPA</i> </h3>
<p>And then there&#8217;s this view from inside the Environmental Protection Agency:</p>
<p>• Dawn Reeves, <a href="https://insideepa.com/daily-news/trump-transition-preparing-scrub-some-climate-data-epa-website">Trump transition preparing to scrub some climate data from EPA Website</a>, <em>Inside EPA</em>, January 17, 2017</p>
<blockquote><p>
The incoming Trump administration&#8217;s EPA transition team intends to remove non-regulatory climate data from the agency&#8217;s website, including references to President Barack Obama&#8217;s June 2013 Climate Action Plan, the strategies for 2014 and 2015 to cut methane and other data, according to a source familiar with the transition team.</p>
<p>Additionally, <a href="https://insideepa.com/node/20758">Obama&#8217;s 2013 memo</a> ordering EPA to establish its power sector carbon pollution standards “will not survive the first day,” the source says, a step that rule opponents say is integral to the incoming administration&#8217;s pledge to roll back the Clean Power Plan and new source power plant rules.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://insideepa.com/sites/insideepa.com/files/documents/jun2013/epa2013_1118b.pdf">Climate Action Plan</a> has been the Obama administration&#8217;s government-wide blueprint for addressing climate change and includes information on cutting domestic greenhouse gas (GHG)emissions, including both regulatory and voluntary approaches; information on preparing for the impacts of climate change; and information on leading international efforts.</p>
<p>The removal of such information from EPA&#8217;s website &#8212; as well as likely removal of references to such programs that link to the White House and other agency websites &#8212; is being prepped now.</p>
<p>The transition team&#8217;s preparations fortify concerns from agency staff, environmentalists and many scientists that the Trump administration is going to destroy reams of EPA and other agencies&#8217; climate data. Scientists have been preparing for this possibility for months, with many working to preserve key data on private websites.</p>
<p>Environmentalists are also stepping up their efforts to preserve the data. The Sierra Club Jan. 13 filed a Freedom of Information Act request seeking reams of climate-related data from EPA and the Department of Energy (DOE), including power plant GHG data. Even if the request is denied, the group said it should buy them some time.</p>
<p>“We’re interested in trying to download and preserve the information, but it’s going to take some time,” Andrea Issod, a senior attorney with the Sierra Club, told <i><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-13/fearing-trump-data-purge-environmentalists-push-to-get-records">Bloomberg</a></i>. “We hope our request will be a counterweight to the coming assault on this critical pollution and climate data.”</p>
<p>While Trump has pledged to take a host of steps to roll back Obama EPA climate and other high-profile actions actions on his first day in office, transition and other officials say the date may slip.</p>
<p>“In truth, it might not [happen] on the first day, it might be a week,” the source close to the transition says of the removal of climate information from EPA&#8217;s website. The source adds that in addition to EPA, the transition team is also looking at such information on the websites of DOE and the Interior Department.</p>
<p>Additionally, incoming Trump press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters Jan. 17 that not much may happen on Inauguration Day itself, but to expect major developments the following Monday, Jan. 23. “I think on [Jan. 23] you&#8217;re going to see a big flurry of activity” that is expected to include the disappearance of at least some EPA climate references.</p>
<p>Until Trump is inaugurated on Jan. 20, the transition team cannot tell agency staff what to do, and the source familiar with the transition team&#8217;s work is unaware of any communications requiring language removal or beta testing of websites happening now, though it appears that some of this work is occurring.</p>
<p>“We can only ask for information at this point until we are in charge. On [Jan. 20] at about 2 o&#8217;clock, then they can ask [staff] to” take actions, the source adds.</p>
<h4> Scope &amp; Breadth </h4>
<p>The scope and breadth of the information to be removed is unclear. While it is likely to include executive actions on climate, it does not appear that the reams of climate science information, including <a href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-research/models-tools-and-databases-climate-change-research">models, tools and databases</a> on the EPA Office of Research &amp; Development&#8217;s (ORD) website will be impacted, at least not immediately.</p>
<p>ORD also has published climate, air and energy strategic research action plans, including one for 2016-2019 that includes research to assess impacts; prevent and reduce emissions; and prepare for and respond to changes in climate and air quality.</p>
<p>But other EPA information maintained on its websites including its <a href="https://www.epa.gov/climatechange">climate change page</a> and its &#8220;<a href="https://www.epa.gov/climatechange/what-epa-doing-about-climate-change">What is EPA doing about climate change</a>&#8221; page that references the Climate Action Plan, the <a href="https://insideepa.com/sites/insideepa.com/files/documents/mar2014/epa2014_0556.pdf">2014 methane strategy</a> and a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/03/28/strategy-cut-methane-emissions">2015 oil and gas methane reduction strategy</a> are expected targets.</p>
<p>Another possible target is new information EPA just compiled&#8212;and hosted a Jan. 17 webinar to discuss&#8212;on <a href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-impacts/climate-change-health-and-populations-concern">climate change impacts to vulnerable communities</a>.</p>
<p>One former EPA official who has experience with transitions says it is unlikely that any top Obama EPA official is on board with this. “I would think they would be violently against this. . . I would think that the last thing [EPA Administrator] Gina McCarthy would want to do would to be complicit in Trump&#8217;s effort to purge the website” of climate-related work, and that if she knew she would “go ballistic.”</p>
<p>But the former official, the source close to the transition team and others note that EPA career staff is fearful and may be undertaking such prep work “as a defensive maneuver to avoid getting targeted,” the official says, adding that any directive would likely be coming from mid-level managers rather than political appointees or senior level officials.</p>
<p>But while the former official was surprised that such work might be happening now, the fact that it is only said to be targeting voluntary efforts “has a certain ring of truth to it. Someone who is knowledgeable would draw that distinction.”</p>
<p>Additionally, one science advocate says, &#8220;The people who are running the EPA transition have a long history of sowing misunderstanding about climate change and they tend to believe in a vast conspiracy in the scientific community to lie to the public. If they think the information is truly fraudulent, it would make sense they would try to scrub it. . . . But the role of the agency is to inform the public . . . [and not to satisfy] the musings of a band of conspiracy theorists.&#8221;</p>
<p>The source was referring to EPA transition team leader Myron Ebell, a long-time climate skeptic at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, along with David Schnare, another opponent of climate action, who is at the Energy &amp; Environment Legal Institute.</p>
<p>And while &#8220;a new administration has the right to change information about policy, what they don&#8217;t have the right to do is change the scientific information about policies they wish to put forward and that includes removing resources on science that serve the public.”</p>
<p>The advocate adds that many state and local governments rely on EPA climate information.</p>
<h4> EPA Concern </h4>
<p>But there has been plenty of concern that such a move would take place, especially after transition team officials last month sought the names of DOE employees who worked on climate change, raising alarms and cries of a “political witch hunt” along with a Dec. 13 letter from Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) that prompted the transition team to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/12/14/trump-transition-says-request-for-names-of-climate-scientists-was-not-authorized/?utm_term=.18c05ebe1b3e">disavow the memo</a>.</p>
<p>Since then, scientists have been scrambling to preserve government data.</p>
<p>On Jan. 10, <i><a href="http://www.hcn.org/articles/tech-experts-move-to-protect-environmental-data-from-trump">High Country News</a></i> reported that on a Saturday last month, 150 technology specialists, hackers, scholars and activists assembled in Toronto for the “Guerrilla Archiving Event: Saving Environmental Data from Trump” where the group combed the internet for key climate and environmental data from EPA&#8217;s website.</p>
<p>“A giant computer program would then copy the information onto an independent server, where it will remain publicly accessible&#8212;and safe from potential government interference.”</p>
<p>The organizer of the event, Henry Warwick, said, “Say Trump firewalls the EPA,” pulling reams of information from public access. “No one will have access to the data in these papers” unless the archiving took place.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Union of Concerned Scientists released a Jan. 17 report, “Preserving Scientific Integrity in Federal Policy Making,” urging the Trump administration to retain scientific integrity. It wrote in a <a href="http://blog.ucsusa.org/gretchen-goldman/can-president-trump-uphold-scientific-integrity-in-government-decisionmaking-new-report-tells-whats-at-stake">related blog post</a>, “So how will government science fare under Trump? Scientists are not just going to wait and see. More than 5,500 scientists have now signed onto a letter asking the president-elect to uphold scientific integrity in his administration. . . . We know what&#8217;s at stake. We&#8217;ve come too far with scientific integrity to see it unraveled by an anti-science president. It&#8217;s worth fighting for.” </p>

<p>We&#8217;ve been busy backing up climate data before Trump becomes President. Now you can help too, with some money to pay for servers and storage space.   Please give what you can at our Kickstarter campaign here:</p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/592742410/azimuth-climate-data-backup-project">Azimuth Climate Data Backup Project</a>.</p>
<p>If we get $5000 by the end of January, we can save this data until we convince bigger organizations to take over.   If we don&#8217;t get that much, we get nothing.  That&#8217;s how Kickstarter works.  Also, if you donate now, you won&#8217;t be billed until January 31st.</p>
<p>So, please help!   It&#8217;s urgent.</p>
<p>I will make public how we spend this money.  And if we get more than $5000, I&#8217;ll make sure it&#8217;s put to good use.  There&#8217;s a lot of work we could do to make sure the data is authenticated, made easily accessible, and so on.</p>
<h3> The idea </h3>
<p>The safety of US government climate data is at risk. Trump plans to have climate change deniers running every agency concerned with climate change.  So, scientists are rushing to back up the many climate databases held by US government agencies before he takes office.</p>
<p>We hope he won&#8217;t be rash enough to delete these precious records. But: <i>better safe than sorry!</i></p>
<p>The <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/azimuth_backup_project/">Azimuth Climate Data Backup Project</a> is part of this effort. So far our volunteers have backed up nearly 1 terabyte of climate data from NASA and other agencies. We&#8217;ll do a lot more!  We just need some funds to pay for storage space and a server until larger institutions take over this task.</p>
<h3> The team</h3>
<p>• <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Jan+Galkowski">Jan Galkowski</a> is a statistician with a strong interest in climate science. He works at Akamai Technologies, a company responsible for serving at least 15% of all web traffic. He began downloading climate data on the 11th of December.</p>
<p>• Shortly thereafter <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/">John Baez</a>, a mathematician and science blogger at U. C. Riverside, joined in to publicize the project. He’d already founded an organization called the Azimuth Project, which helps scientists and engineers cooperate on environmental issues.</p>
<p>• When Jan started running out of storage space, <a href="https://plus.google.com/112648317373638762082">Scott Maxwell</a> jumped in. He used to work for NASA&#8212;driving a Mars rover among other things&#8212;and now he works for Google. He set up a 10-terabyte account on Google Drive and started backing up data himself.</p>
<p>• A couple of days later <a href="https://plus.google.com/+SakariMaaranen/about">Sakari Maaranen</a> joined the team. He’s a systems architect at Ubisecure, a Finnish firm, with access to a high-bandwidth connection. He set up a server, he&#8217;s downloading lots of data, he showed us how to authenticate it with SHA-256 hashes, and he&#8217;s managing many other technical aspects of this project.</p>
<p>There are other people involved too.  You can watch the nitty-gritty details of our progress here:</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Scott Pruitt, who filed legal challenges against Environmental Protection Agency rules <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3290872-Pruitt-v-EPA-a-Compilation-of-Oklahoma-14.html">fourteen times</a>, working <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/22/us/politics/scott-pruitt-environmental-protection-agency.html">hand in hand with oil and gas companies</a>, is now head of that agency.  What does that mean about the safety of climate data on the EPA&#8217;s websites?  Here is an inside report:</p>
<p>&bull;  Dawn Reeves, EPA preserves Obama-Era website but climate change data doubts remain, <i><a href="https://insideepa.com/daily-news/epa-preserves-obama-era-website-climate-change-data-doubts-remain">InsideEPA.com</a></i>, 21 February 2017.</p>
<p>For those of us who are backing up climate data, the really important stuff is in red near the bottom.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>   The EPA has posted a link to an archived version of its website from Jan. 19, the day before President Donald Trump was inaugurated and the agency began removing climate change-related information from its official site, saying the move comes in response to concerns that it would permanently scrub such data.</p>
<p>    However, the archived version notes that links to climate and other environmental databases will go to current versions of them&#8212;continuing the fears that the Trump EPA will remove or destroy crucial greenhouse gas and other data.</p>
<p>    The archived version was put in place and linked to the main page in response to “numerous [Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)] requests regarding historic versions of the EPA website,” says an <a href="https://insideepa.com/sites/insideepa.com/files/documents/feb2017/epa2017_0361a.pdf">email to agency staff</a> shared by the press office. “The Agency is making its best reasonable effort to 1) preserve agency records that are the subject of a request; 2) produce requested agency records in the format requested; and 3) post frequently requested agency records in electronic format for public inspection. To meet these goals, EPA has re-posted a snapshot of the EPA website as it existed on January 19, 2017.”</p>
<p>    The email adds that the action is similar to the snapshot taken of the Obama White House website.</p>
<p>    The <a href="https://19january2017snapshot.epa.gov/">archived version of EPA&#8217;s website</a> includes <a href="https://19january2017snapshot.epa.gov/snapshot-help.html">a “more information” link</a> that offers more explanation.</p>
<p>    For example, it says the page is “not the current EPA website” and that the archive includes “static content, such as webpages and reports in Portable Document Format (PDF), as that content appeared on EPA&#8217;s website as of January 19, 2017.”</p>
<p>    It cites technical limits for the database exclusions. “For example, many of the links contained on EPA&#8217;s website are to databases that are updated with the new information on a regular basis. These databases are not part of the static content that comprises the Web Snapshot.” Searches of the databases from the archive “will take you to the current version of the database,” the agency says.</p>
<p>    “In addition, links may have been broken in the website as it appeared” on Jan. 19 and those will remain broken on the snapshot. Links that are no longer active will also appear as broken in the snapshot.</p>
<p> <font color="red">“Finally, certain extremely large collections of content&#8230; were not included in the Snapshot due to their size” such as AirNow images, radiation network graphs, historic air technology transfer network information, and EPA&#8217;s searchable news releases.”</font></p>
<h4> &#8216;Smart&#8217; Move </h4>
<p>    One source urging the preservation of the data says the snapshot appears to be a “smart” move on EPA&#8217;s behalf, given the FOIA requests it has received, and notes that even though other groups like NextGen Climate and scientists have been working to capture <a href="http://saveourepa.com/climatechange.html">EPA&#8217;s online information</a>, having it on EPA&#8217;s site makes it official.</p>
<p>    But it could also be a signal that big changes are coming to the official Trump EPA site, and it is unclear how long the agency will maintain the archived version.</p>
<p>    The source says while it is disappointing that the archive may signal the imminent removal of EPA&#8217;s climate site, “at least they are trying to accommodate public concerns” to preserve the information.</p>
<p><font color="red">A second source adds that while it is good that EPA is seeking “to address the widespread concern” that the information will be removed by an administration that does not believe in human-caused climate change, “on the other hand, it doesn&#8217;t address the primary concern of the data. It is snapshots of the web text.” Also, information “not included,” such as climate databases, is what is difficult to capture by outside groups and is what really must be preserved.</p>
<p>    “If they take [information] down” that groups have been trying to preserve, then the underlying concern about access to data remains. “Web crawlers and programs can do things that are easy,” such as taking snapshots of text, “but getting the data inside the database is much more challenging,” the source says.</font></p>
<p>    The first source notes that EPA&#8217;s searchable databases, such as those maintained by its Clean Air Markets Division, are used by the public “all the time.”</p>
<p>    The agency&#8217;s Office of General Counsel (OGC) Jan. 25 began a <a href="https://insideepa.com/node/198448">review of the implications</a> of taking down the climate page&#8212;a planned wholesale removal that was temporarily suspended to allow for the OGC review.</p>
<p>    But EPA did remove some specific climate information, including links to the Clean Power Plan and references to President Barack Obama&#8217;s Climate Action Plan. Inside EPA captured this <a href="https://insideepa.com/sites/insideepa.com/files/documents/feb2017/epa2017_0361b.pdf">screenshot</a> of the “What EPA Is Doing” page regarding climate change. Those links are missing on the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/climatechange/what-epa-doing-about-climate-change">Trump EPA site</a>. The archive includes the same <a href="https://www.epa.gov/climatechange/what-epa-doing-about-climate-change">version of the page</a> as captured by our screenshot.</p>
<p>    Inside EPA first reported the <a href="https://insideepa.com/node/198161">plans to take down the climate information</a> on Jan. 17.</p>
<p>    After the OGC investigation began, a source close to the Trump administration said Jan. 31 that climate “propaganda” would be taken down from the EPA site, but that the agency is not expected to remove databases on GHG emissions or climate science. “Eventually&#8230; the propaganda will get removed&#8230;. Most of what is there is not data. Most of what is there is interpretation.”</p>
<p>    The Sierra Club and <a href="https://insideepa.com/node/198862">Environmental Defense Fund</a> both filed FOIA requests asking the agency to preserve its climate data, while attorneys representing youth plaintiffs in a federal climate change lawsuit against the government have also asked the Department of Justice to ensure the data related to its claims is preserved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Azimuth Climate Data Backup Project and other groups are making copies of actual databases, not just the visible portions of websites.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a <em>lot</em> going on!  Here&#8217;s a news roundup.  I will separately talk about what the <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/azimuth_backup_project/">Azimuth Climate Data Backup Project</a> is doing.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll start with the bad news, and then go on to some good news.</p>
<h3> Tweaking the EPA website </h3>
<p>Scientists are keeping track of how Trump administration is changing the Environmental Protection Agency website, with before-and-after photos, and analysis:</p>
<p>• Brian Kahn, <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/onearth/behold-tweaks-trump-has-made-epa-website-far">Behold the &#8220;tweaks&#8221; Trump has made to the EPA website (so far)</a>, <i>National Resources Defense Council</i> blog, 3 February 2017.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s more about &#8220;adaptation&#8221; to climate change, and less about how it&#8217;s caused by carbon emissions.</p>
<p>All of this would be nothing compared to the <a href="http://gizmodo.com/florida-republican-proposes-bill-to-eliminate-the-epa-1792024005">new bill to eliminate the EPA</a>, or Myron Ebell&#8217;s plan to fire most of the people working there:</p>
<p>• Joe Davidson, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/01/30/trump-transition-leaders-goal-is-two-thirds-cut-in-epa-employees/">Trump transition leader’s goal is two-thirds cut in EPA employees</a>, <em>Washington Post</em>, 30 January 2017.</p>
<p>If you want to keep track of this battle, I recommend getting a 30-day free subscription to this online magazine:</p>
<p>• <a href="https://insideepa.com/">InsideEPA.com</a>.</p>
<h3> Taking animal welfare data offline </h3>
<p>The Trump team is taking animal-welfare data offline.  The US Department of Agriculture will no longer make lab inspection results and violations publicly available, citing privacy concerns:</p>
<p>• Sara Reardon, <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/us-government-takes-animal-welfare-data-offline-1.21428">US government takes animal-welfare data offline</a>, <em>Nature Breaking News</em>, 3 Feburary 2017.</p>
<h3> Restricting access to geospatial data </h3>
<p>A new bill would prevent the US government from providing access to geospatial data if it helps people understand housing discrimination.   It goes like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no Federal funds may be used to design, build, maintain, utilize, or provide access to a Federal database of geospatial information on community racial disparities or disparities in access to affordable housing._

<h3> The EDGI fights back </h3>
<p>The Environmental Data and Governance Initiative or <strong>EDGI</strong> is working to archive public environmental data.  They&#8217;re helping coordinate data rescue events.  You can attend one and have fun eating pizza with cool people while saving data:</p>
<p>• 3 February 2017, <a href="http://calagator.org/events/1250471401">Portland</a><br />
• 4 February 2017, <a href="https://datarescuenyc.com/">New York City</a><br />
• 10-11 February 2017, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/datarefugeaustin/">Austin Texas</a><br />
• 11 February 2017, <a href="http://datarescuesfbay.org/">U. C. Berkeley, California</a><br />
• 18 February 2017, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1625484311094707/">MIT, Cambridge Massachusetts</a><br />

<h3> Scientists fight back </h3>
<p>The pushback is so big it&#8217;s hard to list it all!   For now I&#8217;ll just quote some of this article:</p>
<p>• Tabitha Powledge, <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/onscienceblogs/2017/01/27/the-gag-reflex-trump-info-shutdowns-at-us-science-agencies-especially-epa/">The gag reflex: Trump info shutdowns at US science agencies, especially EPA</a>, 27 January 2017.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <strong>THE PUSHBACK FROM SCIENCE HAS BEGUN</strong></p>
<p>  Predictably, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2017/1/26/14395642/twitter-accounts-rebelling-trump-federal-agencies-national-park">counter-tweets claiming to come from rebellious employees</a> at the EPA, the Forest Service, the USDA, and NASA sprang up immediately. At The Verge, Rich McCormick says there’s reason to believe these claims may be genuine, although none has yet been verified. A lovely head on this post: “On the internet, nobody knows if you’re a National Park.”</p>
<p>  At Hit&amp;Run, <a href="http://reason.com/blog/2017/01/26/trump-twitter-and-the-revolt-of-the-per2">Ronald Bailey provides handles for several of these alt tweet streams</a>, which he calls “the revolt of the permanent government.” (That’s a compliment.)</p>
<p>  Bailey argues, “with exception perhaps of some minor amount of national security intelligence, there is no good reason that any information, data, studies, and reports that federal agencies produce should be kept from the public and press. In any case, I will be following the Alt_Bureaucracy feeds for a while.”</p>
<p>  NeuroDojo Zen Faulkes <a href="http://neurodojo.blogspot.com/2017/01/asking-scientific-societies-to-show.html">posted on how to demand that scientific societies show some backbone</a>. “Ask yourself: “Have my professional societies done anything more political than say, ‘Please don’t cut funding?’” Will they fight?,” he asked.</p>
<p>  Scientists associated with the group_ <em>500 Women Scientists</em> _donned lab coats and marched in DC as part of the Women’s March on Washington the day after Trump’s Inauguration, Robinson Meyer reported at the Atlantic. A wildlife ecologist from North Carolina told Meyer, “I just can’t believe we’re having to yell, ‘Science is real.’”</p>
<p>  Taking a cue from how the Women’s March did its social media organizing, other scientists who want to set up a Washington march of their own have put together a closed Facebook group that claims more than 600,000 members, <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2017/01/25/science-march-washington/">Kate Sheridan writes at STAT</a>.</p>
<p>  The <a href="https://twitter.com/ScienceMarchDC">#ScienceMarch Twitter feed</a> says a date for the march will be posted in a few days.  [The march will be on 22 April 2017.]  The group also plans to release tools to help people interested in local marches coordinate their efforts and avoid duplication.</p>
<p>  At <em>The Atlantic</em>, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/01/thanks-to-trump-scientists-are-planning-to-run-for-office/514229/">Ed Yong describes the political action committee 314Action</a>.  (314=the first three digits of pi.)</p>
<p>  Among other political activities, it is holding a webinar on Pi Day&#8212;March 14&#8212;to explain to scientists how to run for office. Yong calls 314Action the science version of Emily’s List, which helps pro-choice candidates run for office.  <a href="http://www.314action.org/want-to-run/">314Action says it is ready to connect potential candidate scientists with mentors&#8212;and donors</a>.</p>
<p>  Other groups may be willing to step in when government agencies wimp out. A few days before the Inauguration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention abruptly and with no explanation cancelled a 3-day meeting on the health effects of climate change scheduled for February. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/01/self-censoring-fears-swirl-as-cdc-abruptly-nixes-climate-and-health-summit/">Scientists told <em>Ars Technica</em>’s Beth Mole</a> that CDC has a history of running away from politicized issues.</p>
<p>  One of the conference organizers from the American Public Health Association was quoted as saying nobody told the organizers to cancel.</p>
<p>  I believe it. Just one more example of the chilling effect on global warming. In politics, once the Dear Leader’s wishes are known, some hirelings will rush to gratify them without being asked.</p>
<p>  The APHA guy said they simply wanted to head off a potential last-minute cancellation. Yeah, I guess an anticipatory pre-cancellation would do that.</p>
<p>  But then&#8212;Al Gore to the rescue! He is joining with a number of health groups&#8212;including the American Public Health Association&#8212;to hold a one-day meeting on the topic Feb 16 at the Carter Center in Atlanta, CDC’s home base. Vox’s <a href="http://www.vox.com/2017/1/26/14402234/cdc-climate-change-conference-al-gore-trump">Julia Belluz reports that it is not clear whether CDC officials will be part of the Gore rescue event</a>.

<h3> The Sierra Club fights back </h3>
<p>The Sierra Club, of which I&#8217;m a proud member, is using the Freedom of Information Act or <strong>FOIA</strong> to battle or at least slow the deletion of government databases.  They wisely started even before Trump took power:</p>
<p>• Jennifer A Dlouhy, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-13/fearing-trump-data-purge-environmentalists-push-to-get-records">Fearing Trump data purge, environmentalists push to get records</a>, <em>BloombergMarkets</em>, 13 January 2017.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how the strategy works:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  U.S. government scientists frantically copying climate data they fear will disappear under the Trump administration may get extra time to safeguard the information, courtesy of a novel legal bid by the Sierra Club.</p>
<p>  The environmental group is turning to open records requests to protect the resources and keep them from being deleted or made inaccessible, beginning with information housed at the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy. On Thursday [January 9th], the organization filed Freedom of Information Act requests asking those agencies to turn over a slew of records, including data on greenhouse gas emissions, traditional air pollution and power plants.</p>
<p>  The rationale is simple: Federal laws and regulations generally block government agencies from destroying files that are being considered for release. Even if the Sierra Club’s FOIA requests are later rejected, the record-seeking alone could prevent files from being zapped quickly. And if the records are released, they could be stored independently on non-government computer servers, accessible even if other versions go offline.
