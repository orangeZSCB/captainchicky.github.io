The people currently living in the midwest U.S who are preparing for a &#039;bomb cyclone&#039;, and recalling the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Blizzard_of_1888&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Blizzard of 1888&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nyacknewsandviews.com/2017/12/nyack-people-places-drive-hudson/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;anticyclone of 1917&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Friday_(1916)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Perfect Storm of 1916&lt;/a&gt;, are going to need a better analogy. The notion of global warming is difficult to convey to people who are freezing in a blizzard. In terms of the scale of truthiness (from metaphors, similies, analogies, analogues, models, simulations, theories) diabetes is perhaps not the strongest. Perhaps the difference between &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;heat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;temperature&lt;/a&gt; can be better communicated better using an economic analogy where &quot;global warming&quot; is comparable to an market trend  and &quot;climate change&quot; is comparable to a market volatility? When the economy is over-heated there is more volatility, better explaining the extreme highs and low temperatures we experience as &quot;climate change&quot;. Meanwhile the disaster we are all trying to avoid is a complete meltdown of the Earth climate&#039;s economy, a climate market crash, resulting in a constant sweltering &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;heat death&lt;/a&gt; and great depression.]]></description>

I know people who have diabetes and one lost his foot.  He&#039;s a cab driver. So he is sitting down almost all day. (He lives not far from me, but his block is so dangerous he doesn&#039;t even go home after 10 pm--just sleeps in his cab. That block was where my current landlord used to live---someone burned that place down 2 years ago---500 people displaced. probably smoking crack. 15 minute walk from me. ).

If it is type 2 diabetes its mostly  diet related.  type 1 diabetes may be genetic--related to insulin receptor.

Type 2 i think may be due to diet---i grew up on &#039;american diet&#039; like candy. McDonald&#039;s french fries, and later alcohol ---a friend of mine celebrated our  elementary school  graduation by drinking a bottle of wine in the park. .  I decided after that i would never drink again--i got very sick ---, tho it didnt work.  My area is loaded with K2, fentanyl, PCP, heroin, oxycontin, and so on. I study outside and its hard to avoid this, Everybody will give you this junk , dope, sweets, and junk food.

I like the diabetes analogy because so many people have type II diabetes but can&#039;t afford treatment and are addicted to sugar, so they don&#039;t make the changes in diet necessary to curtail the problem, and wind up losing sensation in their feet, and &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; don&#039;t take action, and wind up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthline.com/health/diabetes/diabetes-amputation#is-it-common&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;having a foot amputated&lt;/a&gt;.  I imagine the history of the 21st century may resemble this.

But yes: we at least &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; how to treat diabetes.]]></description>

&#039;All our options result in complete reorganization of society,&#039;

This will never happen. At least not in the way as it is, hopefully, intended in its meaning. Like, as a complete reorganization of society, which results in better living conditions for the great majority of people. In its other, far more dark meaning, it would request the use of massive force, nothing other than a dictatorship, to make it happen. Which would not create anything else than a huge backlash from people unwilling to adapt or people disprivileged by the process. It will be highly destructive in any possible way. It&#039;s like a local nuclear war would create a nuclear winter, solving any imminent problems with a rise of global temperature.

That said for the apocalyptic scenario, I don&#039;t think that the diabetes analogy is a better one. We know the causes for diabetes perfectly well, it boils down to essentially only two very clear effects, insulin resistance or failing pancreas cells, but we don&#039;t know all effects influencing the climate so far, not to mention how they interact. I think it is sure to say, that it is a very complex problem. The same for the cure. We know how to treat diabetes. Not by a permanent cure, but essentially perfectly well for the remaining lifespan of an afflicted human. We are not even close to know, like apart from the theoretical idea that the CO2 should get removed from the atmosphere again, what to practically do about this problem. Like in the sense of pursuing something that can be done, and in a way that people will support. World cannot even get rid of nuclear weapons, which is a future problem of possibly even more devastating outcome than climate change, but would be much simpler to address in technical terms. Addressing climate change, to stick in some medical analogy, appears like performing the first heart transplantation. One guesses, that it can be done, one thinks one has the tools necessary for doing it, but the proof is in performing the operation, and by removing the old heart one crosses a point of no return, which makes one restricted to stay on the schedule, otherwise the patient will be surely dead, with an unsure prognosis if the alternative results would not be the same anyhow.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks, John, for underscoring this important read, one which was on my stack but I hadn&#039;t gotten to read until you highlighted it.

Their worries coincide with some of the things I&#039;ve said and written in private and in public, and it has cost a break between my view, ever the engineer, and the movement. The best I can do is disengage as I was asked by a movement colleague, who spoke at the &lt;em&gt;Our Children&#039;s Trust&lt;/em&gt; rally I helped organized, to &quot;not fight them on this.&quot;

The biggest troubles to my mind are that (a) achieving the Naomi Klein Nirvana is likely to take something like a century, and we don&#039;t have that time, (b) once achieved we still have the same problem we do now, engineering-wise, but with options present now ruled out by the politics of the resulting New Way, and (c) the millenarian approach to the problem is dichotomous, as they seem willing to give up rather than trade off and compromise, that is, seeking personal purity rather than accomplishing the necessary ends.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have read quite a few things from Breakthrough Institute.  They remind me of people who want to solve problems like gun violence, obesity,  addiction,  alcoholism, lung cancer from cigarettes, health care, homelessness and economic inequality, but  they all make their money by selling guns, drugs, beer, cigarettes, junk food, as slumlords, etc. The view of people who sell guns and want to stop gun violence is to sell more guns--all teachers should be armed.

Breakthrough basically promotes nuclear power.  On their board is someone from National Review ( a &#039;right wing&#039; magazine founded by William O Buckle  ) The respected climatologist James Hansen also says nuclear is neccesary. Breakthrough does not say &#039;personal behavior and value change&#039; is neccesary.

I&#039;m not sure if anyone on at Breakthrough actually does any science of the kind they promote. They want others to do the &#039;hard lifting&#039; while take a plane to some exotic place.

They are the flip side of the coin of climate alarmists (eg many millenials--eg greta gundberg of sweden, and Bill McKibbben and the author of the Uninhabitable Earth cited in the article.).  All of them say &#039;government should do something about this&#039; . Breakthrough wants hi tech solutions and nukes, millenials want &#039;green energy&#039;.

But they don&#039;t want to do a cost-benefit analyses of their own behavior based on their values.]]></description>

The best-case scenario Nordhaus and Trenbarth imagine involves limiting global warming to 3°C, not 2°C, and working very hard to adapt and limit the damage.  (Let&#039;s face it, human inertia makes staying below 2°C very unlikely at this point.)   They consider this to be more like dealing with diabetes --- a constant painful struggle to keep from dying --- than a &quot;millenarian&quot; scenario.  They think it will require all means at our disposal, including nuclear power, carbon capture and storage, and others that most American environmentalists are more comfortable with.

I agree that bickering about the best approach is less fruitful than actually doing things that can be useful.]]></description>
