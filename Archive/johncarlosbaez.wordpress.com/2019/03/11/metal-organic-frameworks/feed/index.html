					<description><![CDATA[John,
An earlier MOF we modleled for CO2 capture has a nice video (also on my website ) showing selective CO2 capture from a bath of N2. 14:1 N2/CO2 it’s on YouTube here :
https://youtu.be/_ph3ceMm75Q

It might illustrate your focus.

I very much enjoy your work and how you share it.

Sincerely 
Brian Space]]></description>

I am not an expert, I thought that the hemoglobin could be a good absorber for carbon dioxide (like in the blood flow); so that I searched on wikipedia the chemical formula and structure, and I see that the affinity of carbon dioxide in  carbaminohemoglobin (that I read is reversible): I was wrong to think that the activation site was heme, that work for the oxygen and carbon monoxide.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Me too, and we were half right:-)  In addition to transporting oxygen &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt;, hemoglobin transports (10-25% of the body&#039;s respiratory) CO2 &lt;em&gt;out&lt;/em&gt;. 
  And that&#039;s not all:  Hemoglobin also transports other gases including nitrous oxide.
  But wait, there&#039;s more!  Hemoglobin also performs other functions besides gas transport, but for the details you&#039;ll have to consult wikipedia ( or perhaps Ron Popeil, who is still with us), as I&#039;ve forgotten them already.]]></description>

I wouldn&#039;t be too suprised if Hb binds to CO2 with some affinity... as it binds more strongly both to CO and CN than to O2 (thus their toxicity), but CO2 is transported predominantly in the form of bicarbonate ion, serving to buffer the blood at about pH 7.4.. not bound to hemoglobin. Not sure where the poster is getting their information. Also on a density and stoichiometry perspective, I&#039;d imagine that these MOF frameworks could do a better job than protein. At the atomic scale, proteins are really big!

If we&#039;re going for protein engineering as a strategy for CO2 drawdown, my money is on RuBisCO (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuBisCO). RuBisCO fixates CO2 in plants, is likely the most abundant enzyme on Earth, and is involved in the first stage of carbon fixation, reacting Ribulose 1,5-Bisphosphate with CO2. Interestingly O2 competes rather efficiently with CO2 for binding to RuBisCO which, given the amount of time photosynthesis has been around--you&#039;d think that Nature would have figured out a way around that by now. My understanding is that it was long viewed as &quot;good enough&quot; that tunneling through series of maladaptive mutations to reach a more optimized enzyme was disfavored[1].. but making a better RuBisCO is turning out to be harder than synthetic biologists initially thought:

I basically agree, though I&#039;d say: the sciences that are important are sociology, economics, psychology, biology, ecology, chemistry, etc... physics too, but not particle physics or cosmology.

  the survival of the ‘real’ world depends on the behavior of electrons and molecules more than it is on quarks and spacetime.

Well, it&#039;s good to know that space is $latex \mathbb{R}^3$ and time is $latex \mathbb{R}.$  &lt;img src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/emoticons/tongue2.gif&quot; /&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[It is very, very interesting.
I am thinking that there is a natural structure that has a high affinity with the carbon dioxide, the hemoglobin, and I am thinking that it would be possible to incorporate the hemoglobin properties in a metal organic frameworks, building a MOF with three-dimensional repetition of heme coordination complex (biology has optimized the carbon dioxide capture).
I am thinking that a pure crystal structure using organic chemistry, and iron atoms, could be enough to increase adsorption of carbon dioxide, or other gases.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very interesting. I have a car that runs on methane and it would be nice to not have to gas up so much! But I would say hydrogen is the ideal.

I guess one way I can envision using MOF&#039;s is as better energy storage for data centers.  The DOE has an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.energy.gov/fe/articles/doe-announces-38-million-investment-new-methane-gas-hydrate-research&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;interesting project&lt;/a&gt; investigating the extraction of methane hydrate.  One thing I thought about was why not just locate data centers in the arctic sitting on top of this stuff (it&#039;s already cool).  Maybe MOF storage coupled with gas turbines with heat recapture would drive the carbon footprint down significantly.  I have no idea if it could aid the extraction process itself.

Of course, you still need high-speed data transfer, but things like &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/aerospace/satellites/spacex-confident-about-its-starlink-constellation-for-satellite-internet-others-not-so-much&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;starlink&lt;/a&gt; will be coming online soon.  This may make at least scientific computing viable, and the DOE already runs the nations top supercomputers so perhaps there are some synergies that could be exploited.  In turn, the supercomputers could be doing MD to improve MOF design!]]></description>
