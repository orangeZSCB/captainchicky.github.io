					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2019/03/24/complex-adaptive-system-design-part-9/#comment-148604&quot;&gt;James Juniper&lt;/a&gt;.

I&#039;m very interested in integrating these things, and it&#039;s great to hear you actually want that for practical reasons!

It may not be easy to follow, but my talk here describes the connection:

&#8226; John Baez, &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ACT2018/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Props in network theory&lt;/a&gt;,  Applied Category Theory 2018, May 4, 2018.

The category where morphisms are &#039;open Petri nets&#039; is called RxNet in these slides, and the main category where morphisms are &lt;em&gt;drawn&lt;/em&gt; as signal flow graphs is called LinRel.  My student Jason Erbele and I have also studied the category SigFlow where morphisms &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; signal flow graphs.  My talk slides contain links to papers on all these categories... but feel free to ask questions!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was wondering whether you were also working on the integration of Petri nets with signal flow graphs along the lines of your work with Erbele. Bonchi, Sobocinski and Zanasi have used props for both kinds of model, with different sets of generators and relations, but they haven&#039;t looked at integration. This would be useful for me as an economist, because it would allow researchers to combine systems of differential equations modelling a macro-economy with a multi-sectoral approach to pricing and income distribution along the lines suggested by Ricardo, Marx, Leontieff, and Sraffa.]]></description>
