HI John and Timber

For a sobering view on afforestation and reforestation you might find an article by Simon Lewis in April 4, 2019 issue of Nature.  Yes, we need to reforest as much as we can, but can we?

Anyway, it is a good discussion.

Best

					<description><![CDATA[Hi John

Very glad to have found your blog.  I love it.  My take on DACCS is that the cost is not the important issue.  It is an issue and very irresponsible of us to leave this cost to our children and grandchildren.  But the important issue is energy costs.  It takes between 0.15 and 0.3 Mtoe of energy to capture 1 MtCO2 from the atmosphere.  We need to pull in about 730 Billion Tons total by 2100, of course we need to continue to do this after that.  The rate of extraction at 2100 is about 18 billion tons.  The energy required to do this is therefore, between 2.7 and 5.4 Billion tons of oi equivalent energy every year just to capture it.  That does not include sequestering it.  I have not found the energy cost of sequestration yet as nobody knows how to do it.

My take here: https://blueridgeleader.com/direct-air-capture/

best regards

Wow, what sort of gas separation engineering technologies do you use, or study?

I like your idea.  Of course it&#039;s a bit crazy, but they all are.  I wonder how alkaline the water would need to be, and how long it would need to remain liquid (or could it work when frozen?).  It seems a bit hard to spray a lot of &lt;em&gt;liquid&lt;/em&gt; water into the Antarctic air.

Those katabatic winds are indeed impressive.

					<description><![CDATA[I usually join internet discussions because I am an amateur enthusiast on math and physics. But my “day-time job” happens to be gas separation engineering.

Good idea John, to start talking about the CO2 problem.

One crazy idea I had, was to scrub CO2 on Antarctica. On Antarctica, we have a lot of energy, especially wind. The katabatic winds. (https://icecube.wisc.edu/pole/weather).
We could use this energy to spray alkaline water in the air, capturing CO2. This would fall as CO2 rich snow on Antarctica. Most of Antarctica is actually a desert, so this snow will just stay there for thousands of years (after which, we might be in a next ice age).

Where I live (Finland) there has been a suggestion of driving the annual growth of our forests into bogs and marshlands (which are plentiful here) where the wood would decompose to peat in oxygen-free conditions. The actors doing this would get emission permits in exchange, an element of the cap-and-trade system, which they could then sell to germans. This would make the effort profitable for those actors.

Well, the european cap-and-trade system in its current form does not work that way, I think, and I don&#039;t know offhand how scalable the approach would be. I recall having seen estimates where the energy content of the pre-existing peat deposits in Finlsnd were compared to the norwegian oil fields in the North Sea.]]></description>

I like the idea of harnessing cyanobacteria, possibly genetically engineered, to do good things.  If they can suck CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; out of the air, powered by sunlight, and turn it into some substance people like, it could in theory be commercially practical.   And if it also sequesters carbon, that would be nice.

For example, suppose we made all our plastics this way.  Since we only used 348 megatonnes of plastic in 2017, that would only convert ~1% of our carbon emissions into useful material.  But it would be lot better than the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eenews.net/stories/1060089781&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ethane cracker plants&lt;/a&gt; people are planning in the Appalachians!]]></description>
