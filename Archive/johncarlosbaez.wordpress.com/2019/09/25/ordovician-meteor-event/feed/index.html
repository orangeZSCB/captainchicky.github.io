  I guess the dust cooling effect is not a good argument for terraforming like activities to counteract climate change?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the Ordovician, some people think the dust cooled the Earth so much that it caused an ice age leading to a mass extinction event!

However, that&#039;s unlikely with human-created dust, or aerosols, because they fall out of the atmosphere pretty quickly... unless we do something dumb like make self-reproducing drones that spray aerosols into the upper atmosphere, and we can&#039;t control them, and they run wild.  Let&#039;s not do that!

A more tricky problem with aerosol cooling is that it will probably not just cool all the Earth evenly; it will affect weather patterns in some more complicated way, and we&#039;d have to try to figure this out.

No matter what happens, there will be winners and losers, and the losers will be unhappy.   But I don&#039;t think this immediately rules out the idea.  There are always winners and losers... including for global warming.

Another problem with aerosol cooling is that it does nothing to help stop ocean acidification.  So ocean reefs, and many molluscs, will die out.   &lt;a href=&quot;https://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/15/i.1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Mussels are already in trouble&lt;/a&gt;.

But this is not really an argument against aerosol cooling: it&#039;s an argument for cutting carbon emissions.]]></description>

I have not seen an update on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/keutschgroup/scopex&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;SCoPEx project.&lt;/a&gt; They were supposed to have a small trial this year. These people know what they are doing and they aren&#039;t likely to &quot;paint us into a corner&quot;. Sprinkling a little calcium carbonate (chalk/limestone) into the atmosphere is not likely to have more effect than an airline jet contrail. &lt;b&gt;Science&lt;/b&gt; is really just a debug and repair process: putting knobs on whatever moves, and spirally in on a &quot;fix&quot;.

There are many binary star systems. Is that the &#039;normal&#039; result for solar system formation? Is our solar system a failed binary?
Should Jupiter have become a sun, if it weren&#039;t for ...?]]></description>

The line of craters probably isn&#039;t as precise as it looks here:

&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordovician_radiation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

For a map showing the actual locations of craters go here and scroll down:

&#8226; Wikipedia, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordovician_meteor_event&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ordovician meteor event&lt;/a&gt;.

Unfortunately that projection makes it a bit hard to see how close the craters are to lying on a line.

Here are those on the North American plate:

It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; amazing that they can figure this stuff out.  See the section &quot;Evidence&quot; here:

&#8226; Wikipedia, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Ordovician_glaciation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Late Ordovician glaciation&lt;/a&gt;.

though there&#039;s also a sentence about evidence in the first section.]]></description>
