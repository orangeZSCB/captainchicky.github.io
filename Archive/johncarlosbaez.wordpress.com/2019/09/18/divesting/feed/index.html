Shell is buying its stock on the open market and cancelling the shares. If divestors drive the stock price down that would be good for Shell.

&lt;b&gt;Share buyback programme &lt;/b&gt;

Information about our current share buyback programme.

&lt;i&gt;Royal Dutch Shell plc (the ‘company’) announced the start of its share buyback programme on July 26, 2018. The company’s intention remains to buy back at least $25 billion of its shares by the end of 2020, subject to further progress with debt reduction and oil price conditions.&lt;/i&gt;

To further complicate matters, as the stock price goes down, the calculated yield on the stock dividend goes up making the stock more enticing. In the short run anyhow.

The idea of divestment is that it slowly makes it socially unacceptable to invest in certain things, and thus &lt;em&gt;slowly&lt;/em&gt; drives down the price of these stocks... which in turn makes people even less eager to invest in them.

You can imagine people selling and reselling an egg that&#039;s slowly going rotten and becoming more stinky.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Since this post opened with a letter from Bill McKibben, followers might be interested in what Michael Shellenberger has written in Forbes about Mr. McKibben and nuclear power …

&lt;b&gt;Green New Deal Excludes Nuclear And Would Thus Increase Emissions -- Just Like It Did In Vermont&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;i&gt;One influential local voice loudly opposing continued operation of the nuclear plant belonged to the climate activist Bill McKibben. “I&#039;ve been opposed to Vermont Yankee for a long time,” McKibben wrote in 2012. “I believe Vt. is completely capable of replacing (and far more) its power output with renewables, which is why my roof is covered with solar panels.”

Pro-nuclear environmentalists disagreed. In a highly-detailed 2010 analysis they warned that the closure of Vermont Yankee would increase emissions.

McKibben was unmoved. In a 2013 debate at Vermont’s Middlebury College with pro-nuclear filmmaker Robert Stone, McKibben told the crowd, “We don’t need nuclear power.”

Vermont’s rising emissions prove that it did. Had Vermont’s utilities supplied its customers with power from Vermont Yankee instead of from out-of-state fossil electricity, nearly half of the state’s increase in emissions since 1990 could have been avoided.

I reached out to McKibben to ask if he regretted his anti-nuclear advocacy. He responded that Vermont Yankee’s closure “didn&#039;t, I think, lead to big increases in emissions from Vermont electricity.”
He pointed to a New York Times data tool, which he said showed “the state replaced the [nuclear] power by buying lots and lots more hydro from Quebec.”

But that’s not what the data actually show. In reality, Vermont’s utilities couldn’t replace with in-state generation the lost electricity from Vermont Yankee, instead turning to electricity imports from the New England power pool, primarily from natural gas.&lt;/i&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[The 2 things I wonder about are

1) if you do divest from fossil fuel/ carbon based industries (ie sell stocks you own), what is to prevent others from buying these stocks? I guess the idea is to basically create a new social norm---just get it generally accepted that its no longer socially acceptable to do certain things (even if in the short run you may lose some money and suffer some pain from changing lifestyle---no more slavery, gun and drug trade, etc  ).  Some people are choosing to buy electric venicles, or not own a car (bike or take uber) .

(i think i do not own any stocks including ones in fossil fuels tho i still have enough cash in my bank account to possibly pay rent  for a year and then i have to revert to &#039;cliff dwelling&#039;. my  bank account  is actually with a major bank which has been implicated as a major pro-fossil fuel supporter (and i have protested them).  Only reason i have that account is because someone i know who works there opened an account for me, since i didn&#039;t have a bank account.

I did have a bank account at the old local Community Credit Union---which folded, so i lost the few 100s$ i had in there which was my &#039;nest egg&#039; or emergency fund.  So that was sort of like losing your house in a fire---have to find somewhere else, even if the house was 2nd rate.

2) If you do create a carbon tax, it seems it should be done in a &#039;complex way&#039;---witness the yellow vest movement in France, which apparently was a reaction by the rural low income people to gas tax increases.

In my area you basically have to be wealthy or upper income to have convenient public transit.  (my local bus lines during rush hour are often standing room only; but you go to &#039;nicer neighborhoods&#039; and the buses are often half empty.    Few people want to stand for an hour in a moving bus so as quick as they can, people buy cars.)

The &#039;sky trust&#039; discussed by Peter Barnes in an old article in YES magazine is a more nuanced approach to carbon taxes--=you help all boats rise by giving rebates to those in need, while they also transition to new lifestyles not based on alot of commuting.  In my area many bus commuters (until they get a car) work building new roads. (Now some have jobs installing solar panels.)]]></description>

That is a very interesting or puzzling graph.  I do note the last 2 columns---humans aren&#039;t responsible for climate change, or it&#039;s not even happening---are both relatively small %s.  (Some physicists and philosophers argue that time doesn&#039;t exist, so I wonder if that implies climate doesn&#039;t change.)

The countries don&#039;t neatly line up---in EU, Italy and Spain are up near the top   (possibly because they experience the brunt of both some of the extreme heat and theoretically partly climate induced human migrations---even Syrian war has been described as partly due to climate change effect on agriculture) . UK and France in the middle, Nordic countries and USA at bottom. Mideast countries are both in the middle and bottom.

There is a lot of media I come across (mostly USA (Heartland institute), UK, and Australia ) which cherry picks scientific findings to argue  use of fossil fuels have no role ( &#039;Copenhagen consensus&#039; , and even Nordhaus seemed to discount it a bit).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Selling shares (equity) of Shell and other carbon-based energy suppliers out of portfolios as has been suggested (under the name &quot;divestment&quot;) above will have little financial effect on the companies involved unless they have reason to bring new shares to market. Refusing to buy bonds (ie. lend to Shell et al) would have an effect when Shell tries to sell bonds to finance new operations.

This is more interesting …

&lt;b&gt;How to Cut Emissions Without Wrecking the Economy&lt;/b&gt; 
&lt;i&gt;A proposal for carbon dividends, backed by the broadest climate coalition in American history.&lt;/i&gt;

https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-to-cut-emissions-without-wrecking-the-economy-11569184262

&quot;In a major shift, the Business Roundtable recently embraced the idea that the purpose of a corporation should go beyond serving shareholders and include responsibility to the environment and the broader community.
 … 
&quot;The outcome of this two-year dialogue is a breakthrough plan to cut U.S. carbon emissions in half by 2035—while benefiting American businesses, workers and consumers.
 … 
&quot;Our carbon-dividends plan demonstrates that economic dynamism, environmental stewardship and social well-being are mutually compatible and need not be traded off against one another. It should serve as the basis for a much-needed bipartisan climate breakthrough.

Sounds a lot like a carbon tax.

&lt;b&gt;What Would Milton Friedman Do About Climate Change? Tax Carbon&lt;/b&gt;

&quot;The media always reports that there&#039;s near consensus among scientists about the effect of human activity on the climate. What gets less attention is that I think there&#039;s even greater consensus, starting from Milton Friedman and going to the most left-wing economist you can find, that the obvious practical solution is to put a price on carbon. It&#039;s not controversial.&quot;

Not controversial unless you&#039;re selling carbon. But in our world carbon sellers are in the minority .. or so I&#039;ve read.]]></description>

  Good point about Norway.  These places with small populations and a lot of wealth may be more easily capable of change.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But of course Norway gets a lot of its wealth from oil: 1/3 of its exports are of oil.   As a nation they seem to be trying to have it both ways.  According to the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/17/world/europe/norway-climate-oil.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;:

  In fact, Norway hopes that only electric cars will be sold in the country by 2025 — a surprising goal, given that it means kicking the nation’s powerful oil industry in the shins.
  
  But Norway’s big electric push on cars does not mean the nation is abandoning fossil fuels, revealing what critics call a notable contradiction in its climate policy.
  
  While Norway wants to wean its own citizens off fossil fuels, it remains one of the world’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eia.gov/beta/international/index.cfm?view=production&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;biggest oil producers&lt;/a&gt; and is &lt;a href=&quot;www.npd.no/en/news/News/2016/The-Shelf-in-2016/2-Petroleum-production/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;revving up production&lt;/a&gt;, almost all of it for export. So even as the country tries to cut emissions and clean up its own carbon ledger at home, it is effectively doing the opposite abroad.
  
  Spurred by attractive state subsidies, the Norwegian oil company Statoil is chasing after new oil and gas fields in the Arctic. Nearly all of the supply is destined for export — and to show up in the carbon emissions of countries that burn Norwegian oil and gas.
  
  There’s a lot of it, too. Peter Erickson, a senior scientist with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sei-international.org/mediamanager/documents/Publications/SEI-DB-2017-Norway-oil-production-well-under-2C.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Stockholm Environment Institute&lt;/a&gt;, a research organization, found that emissions from Norway’s oil exports this year will be 10 times as much as Norway’s domestic carbon emissions.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Perhaps this is why Norway is near the very bottom of countries when it comes to how many citizens feel human activity is mainly responsible for climate change.  Look who is second to the bottom:
