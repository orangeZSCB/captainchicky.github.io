I should have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.resilience.org/stories/2019-09-13/a-globalised-solar-powered-future-is-wholly-unrealistic-and-our-economy-is-the-reason-why/#comment-4625887268&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;included this link&lt;/a&gt; to the comment I just made, but I did not have it handy. It&#039;s a link to a Comment I made at &lt;em&gt;resilience.org&lt;/em&gt; on a post arguing that a solar-driven future was unrealistic as long as our economy was capitalist. (I&#039;m oversimplifying.)

That said, and while I believe the existing economic system is in severe need of reformation, including bringing back Eisenhower-era 90% tax brackets, and more socialization of benefits, I still think enlightened and socialist capitalism has benefits and power.

@rovingbroker,

Actually, I strongly &lt;em&gt;disagree&lt;/em&gt; a general &lt;em&gt;markets&lt;/em&gt; meltdown due to a pricing in of the impacts of climate disruption is far in the future.

Indeed, I think it could happen at any time now.]]></description>

The ideas of cap &#038; trade and a carbon tax have been well-known for decades, and they are already implemented in civilized places like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/climate-change-energy-efficiency/climate-change/carbon-tax&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.c2es.org/content/california-cap-and-trade/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/ets_en&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;.  But I worry that we don&#039;t seem to be making progress on getting the US federal government, China or India to implement such programs.  The US has been going in the other direction.

Also, such programs only have a significant effect when the prices of permits, or the price on carbon, is high enough.   Getting that to happen requires political will, and I&#039;m not sure that&#039;s happened yet in Singapore, California or Europe.

In short, I&#039;m not opposed to these ideas: I&#039;ve long felt they are our best option, and I don&#039;t have alternatives that I think are better.  But I&#039;m not sure we&#039;re going to get serious about these ideas anytime soon.  So I&#039;m expecting that weather-related disasters will continue to get worse as the century progresses, leading to a flood of refugees, and wars.]]></description>

Two obvious methods are &quot;cap and trade&quot; and a carbon tax.

Singapore 2018:
&lt;i&gt;The finance minister said the Government expects to collect a carbon tax revenue of nearly $1 billion over the first five years, and is prepared to spend more than this in the same period &quot;to support worthwhile projects which deliver the necessary abatement in emissions&quot;.

He added that the carbon tax will apply uniformly to all sectors, calling it &quot; the economically efficient way to maintain a transparent, fair and consistent carbon price across the economy to incentivise [sic] emissions reduction&quot;.&lt;/i&gt;

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-budget-2018-carbon-tax-of-5-per-tonne-of-greenhouse-gas-emissions-to-be-levied

It was not so long ago that gasoline prices in the US were far higher than today and fuel economy numbers were printed on new car window (price) stickers. Dealers were awash in unsold Chevrolet Suburbans and other large SUVs.

People respond to incentives, both positive and negative. A climate meltdown is far in the future but high prices act immediately.]]></description>

@rovingbroker,

I agree that options for a properly &lt;em&gt;motivated&lt;/em&gt; as well as incentivized capitalism should be kept open. However, I think it&#039;s important to realize this kind of pollution is like no other that&#039;s faced any economy in all of human history. It is a pollutant which remains in the system naturally for over a thousand years, and its effects linger for longer.

It&#039;s not like cleaning up DDT or CFHCs where simply stopping emissions fixes it. In fact, &quot;cleaning it up&quot; demands rolling out incredibly expensive yet-to-be-perfected equipment on a global and massive scale. We&#039;re talkin&#039; multiples of Gross World Product to get it done, and &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; assumes emissions have been essentially zeroed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[While we&#039;re discussing books we haven&#039;t read …

Ronald Baily writes …

&quot;Global warming is a classic example of what happens in an open-access commons. The atmosphere is unowned, so no one has an incentive to protect and conserve it. Instead, people overexploit and pollute it. ... Eventually federal regulations and market mechanisms were adopted. As a result, since 1980 air pollutants have collectively declined by 68 percent while the economy grew by 175 percent.

&quot;Scientists call this the environmental Kuznets curve. Environmental commons tend to deteriorate as countries begin to develop economically—but once per-capita income reaches a certain level, the public starts to demand a cleanup. It&#039;s a U-shaped pattern: Economic growth initially hurts the environment, but after a point it makes things cleaner. By then, slowing or stopping economic growth will delay environmental improvement, including efforts to mitigate the problem of man-made global warming.

&quot;The MIT economist Andrew McAfee explains the process in a forthcoming book, More from Less:

&lt;i&gt;We have finally learned how to tread more lightly on our planet….In America—a large rich country that accounts for about 25 percent of the global economy—we&#039;re now generally using less for most resources year after year, even as our economy and population continue to grow. What&#039;s more, we&#039;re also polluting the air and water less, emitting fewer greenhouse gases, and seeing population increases in many animals that had almost vanished. America, in short, is post-peak in its exploitation of the earth. The situation is similar in many other rich countries, and even developing countries such as China are now taking better care of the planet in important ways.&lt;/i&gt;

&quot;The upshot is that Klein, The Guardian, and many of the climate strikers have it exactly backwards. Properly incentivized capitalism is the key to solving the problems caused by climate change.
