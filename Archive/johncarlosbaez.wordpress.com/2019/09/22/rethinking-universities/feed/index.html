					<description><![CDATA[A few months ago I went to a lecture/seminar/discussion  at a fairly well known university with 3 well known academics who study public opinion about climate change.  One worked at the university , another flew 1500 miles to be there, and the 3rd drove 30 miles to get there (his university is well known for having a center partly devoted to &#039;debunking the myth of AGW&#039;--it has a couple of &#039;economics Nobel prize winners&#039;  associated with it . )

(That center also recently rejected my grant proposal for a &#039;startup&#039; (a low cost or &#039;free university&#039; , think tank, and permaculture project--not everyone can do advanced math research for a living, so you may have to do some small scale agriculture and maintenance as well , while at the same time learning about a scientific world view.
   I knew i would be rejected but thought there was a 1% chance).

(That public university also has faculty who argue that universities and university  education should mostly be abolished (apart from their own tenured positions) ---they don&#039;t see a need for more grad students--they have enough--they need carpenters, plumbers, electricians, home health care workers for their aging relatives  So they advocate for trade schools. )

There were maybe 6 people on the panel , and maybe 10-15 people in the audience. (Most of  the students were outside studying for exams or hanging out).

I actually went there to see if there were any opportunities for grad study, but the panel  basically did not take any questions at the end---they had to go to a restaurant. In the past (and likely even now) I could live for a year on the amount of money the 3 academics spent on plane fare, gasoline, and restaurant bills for that 2 hour discussion (which basically said nothing new--its all been published many times before, and some of that research has been criticized for a bit of &#039;sloppiness&#039; (they had to retract some papers).

I am sympathetic to the idea that there should be free education, and eliminate  student debt--but if  this just means paying for restuarants, plane travel, sloppy research (some conducted  by internet polls--is an internet poll a &#039;randomly controlled sample&#039;?), and gas money then maybe I don&#039;t.  Also the University library where the &#039;conference&#039; was at and where I used to be  until 2am many nights--when they closed--- was paid for by one of the Oil emirate countries in mideast. (I had a 3 mile walk home but i enjoyed the walk.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Izabella Łaba, Vaclav Smil and even Jonathan Watts, tosser that he is, are articulating the same problem.
We have known about exponential growth in a finite world as a technical problem for the human condition at least since 1798 when Robert Malthus wrote about this. It has been reinvented/rediscovered at various times since. After King Hubbert with peak oil in 1956 perhaps one of the most prominent was by Forrester, Meadows et al with ‘Limits to Growth’ in 1972 about the same time as Al Bartlett started his famous lecture tour. In more recent times similar concerns have been by expressed by Gail Tverberg, Kate Raiworth, Tim Jackson and Richard Heinberg. Never heard of them? I’m sure you have, look them up anyway. Of course they are not alone, there are tens of other but unfortunately only tens, not even hundreds. There are two reasons for this. The first is that even now none of these people saying the end of the world is nigh but some years hence things are gooing to be very difficult. Moreover human interaction with complex exponentials is a near impossible thing to predict in detail. Who really wants to know the Lemming will rush off a cliff in ten years time? It may never happen and it hasn’t happened yet. This comes to the second reason which is particularly important as scientists and it is theirs and similar work is virulently and systematically rubbished by prominent, dissonant psychotics. Naming names, try Marx versus Malthus or Nordhaus versus Meadows. Their rubbishing is not pursued as rational debate to attain understanding but crafted misrepresentation little short of agnotologism. Do it well and you get a Nobel Prize in economics. Why is this? Simply because growth is a precursor for human gain that manifests in a dominant few as greed, narcissism and other psychotic anti social personality and dissonant traits. In no way do such people with such extreme characteristics want their actions to be constrained in any kind of way with binding limits. So guess what, they work hard bullshitting everyone into believing they don’t need to. Some sort of progress since they used to kill people. And Izabella, to a significant extent similar behaviour can be found in our local leaders and managers operating apparent benign systems such as universities and hospitals. They get away with this perversity to the delight of about 50% of the population because, they too, have similar behavioural traits but to a milder degree. This is the crux of the problem - innate human psychology. This what we need to work on. Look at the slagging Vaclav Smil got from IEEE Spectrum readers for two recent articles on energy management to see how difficult this going to be and Jonathan Watts is clearly no help.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s a compelling read, even in slide-deck form.

Conferencing without air travel &lt;i&gt;has&lt;/i&gt; to be a solvable problem. Gosh dang it, we&#039;re scientists &#8212; we&#039;re supposed to be &lt;i&gt;smart.&lt;/i&gt; We can, individually, try to do online meetings, but if the institutions still give us reputational credit for burning a metric ton of carbon in order to give a 12-minute APS talk (and to sit in the audience for many of the same, learning roughly nothing), well, let&#039;s just say that the incentives are pointing in the wrong direction.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The trouble you&#039;re describing is pretty common, it&#039;s also seen in public school systems and anything else dependent on tax money. For a start, tax money is relatively without limits, you have a captive set of taxpayers, and they either pay, or the state takes what they have, and despoils them. So they end up paying whatever gets required of them. Another thing is that people who are the beneficiaries of this largesse form an ever larger percentage of the population, so that there are some countries like Greece, for example, where the tax-dependent population is larger than that part which pays the taxes - and they can and do vote to take more from the taxpayers. And the taxpayers pay up, and it doesn&#039;t matter who they elect, because the game is rigged - or the money from corruption and graft is just too much to pass up.

So what tax-supported universities have become are vehicles for making money for those in power - education and research are the facade, but it&#039;s just about money. And places like that - this includes K-12 public schools, too - feature bureaucracy, corruption, and graft. So the interminable construction projects go to a favored few companies which buy the politicians or administrators, and they exist to keep up the cash flow. Remember, taxpayers are pretty much captives, so they have to pay; the university will have a steady stream of these construction projects, one after the other, in what might seem to be a mindless flow - tearing down buildings for bog bucks, to build new buildings for big bucks - and the cash flows to the companies, their suppliers, and the other players. The benefit to the university, its faculty and students - that&#039;s of minor importance. Same case for bureaucracy - bureaucrats make work for themselves, and they avoid work as much as possible, while constantly increasing their share of the cash. If they can con people to do their work for them, they will, and if that doesn&#039;t work, they&#039;ll use fear and force - the adjunct is the ultimate precarious worker. And bureaucracies expand in order to get more power and money which they can skim off for themselves.

It will take a Mario Savio to fix things, someone willing to throw a monkeywrench into the gears of the machine, and it won&#039;t be pleasant. But the alternative isn&#039;t pleasant, either, where the university is an institution taken over by finance capitalism, where exponential growth is a necessity. And that&#039;s not sustainable - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI1C9DyIi_8]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In accordance with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Queen_hypothesis&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Red Queen Hypothesis&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;You have to keep running just to stay in the same place.&quot;. 
The resulting collateral damage to the food chain is a contagious form of stress.

More &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Enough_at_Last&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;time&lt;/a&gt;, can slow down a nuclear explosion and turn it into a useful nuclear power plant- but how do you take control of a global melt-down? Global Warming (climate change is just the symptom), is a much larger runaway heat generator than Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima.
You have to think very elliptically before you start to see the shifts in the jet stream by bomb cyclones and arctic blasts looking more like the huge&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin%E2%80%93Helmholtz_instability&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Kelvin-Helmholtz Instabilities&lt;/a&gt; on Jupiter.

&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monsters_Are_Due_on_Maple_Street&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Accountability&lt;/a&gt; is hard to find these days.

Someone should be wrangled into the cat-seat; with consequences. Perhaps ideally they should not believe in the Moon-Landing Conspiracy, the Flat-Earth Theory, or candle-light vigils. It&#039;s a dignified janitorial position consisting of mopping up after &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Marching_Morons&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;adult children.&lt;/a&gt; Conscripted applicants will be given complete authority over a mop and a bucket with opportunities for advancement.]]></description>
