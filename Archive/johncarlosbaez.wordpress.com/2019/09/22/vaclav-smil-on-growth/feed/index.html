					<description><![CDATA[One more &quot;interesting book I haven&#039;t read yet, &quot;More from Less: The Surprising Story of How We Learned to Prosper Using Fewer Resources--and What Happens Next,&quot; by Andrew McAfee. McAfee is interviewed on this week&#039;s EconTalk.

&lt;i&gt;Andrew McAfee of MIT&#039;s Sloan School of Management talks about his book, More from Less, with EconTalk host Russ Roberts. McAfee argues that technology is helping developed nations use fewer resources in producing higher levels of economic output. The improvement is not just a reduction in energy per dollar of GDP but less energy in total as economic growth progresses. This &quot;dematerialization&quot; portends a future that was unimaginable to the economists and pundits of the past. McAfee discusses the potential for dealing with climate change in a dematerialized world, the non-material aspects of economic progress, and the political repercussions of the current distribution of economic progress.&lt;/i&gt;

However, while that book was interesting, I personally didn&#039;t like that much, for various reasons. Still, definitely worth reading overall.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[On Degrowth …

&lt;b&gt;Evidence of a Decline in Electricity Use by U.S. Households&lt;/b&gt;

Abstract

&lt;i&gt;This paper shows that U.S. households use less electricity than they did ﬁve years ago. The decrease has been experienced broadly, in virtually all U.S. states and across all seasons of the year. This pattern stands in sharp contrast to steady increases throughout previous decades and has signiﬁcant implications for household budgets, energy markets, and the environment. I discuss some of the implications of the decline and then take preliminary steps toward identifying potential explanations. While multiple factors have contributed, I argue that the rapid emergence of LEDs and other energy eﬃcient lighting has played a particularly important role.&lt;/i&gt;

http://e2e.haas.berkeley.edu/pdf/workingpapers/WP030.pdf?mod=article_inline

Via the Wall Street Journal

&lt;b&gt;Americans Are No Longer Gluttons for Electricity—Thank the LED Bulb&lt;/b&gt; 
After increasing 10-fold between 1950 and 2010, average residential consumption dipped

&lt;i&gt;“Is this a small pause?” he asked. “Or will we all buy electric vehicles?”

That would reduce vehicle emissions by half. But, Dr. Davis said, it would accelerate household electricity use by 20% overnight.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;b&gt;The Return of Nature&lt;/b&gt;
How Technology Liberates the Environment

https://thebreakthrough.org/journal/issue-5/the-return-of-nature

&lt;i&gt;Agriculture has always been the greatest destroyer of nature, stripping and despoiling it, and reducing acreage left. Then, in about 1940, acreage and yield decoupled in the United States. Since then American farmers have quintupled corn while using the same or even less land.&lt;/i&gt;
 [ … ]
&lt;i&gt;Crucially, rising yields have not required more tons of fertilizer or other inputs. The inputs to agriculture have plateaued and then fallen — not just cropland but nitrogen, phosphates, potash, and even water. A recent meta-analysis by Wilhelm Klümper and Matin Qaim of 147 original studies of recent trends in high-yield farming for soy, maize, and cotton, funded by the German government and the European Union, found a 37 percent decline in chemical pesticide use while crop yields rose 22 percent. This is the story of precision agriculture, in which we use more bits, not more kilowatts or gallons. &lt;/i&gt;
 [ … ]
&lt;i&gt;In addition to peak farmland and peak timber, America may also be experiencing peak use of many other resources. Back in the 1970s, it was thought that America’s growing appetite might exhaust Earth’s crust of just about every metal and mineral. But a surprising thing happened: even as our population kept growing, the intensity of use of the resources began to fall. For each new dollar in the economy, we used less copper and steel than we had used before — not just the relative but also the absolute use of nine basic commodities, flat or falling for about 20 years. By about 1990, Americans even began to use less plastic. America has started to dematerialize. &lt;/i&gt;
 [ … ]
&lt;i&gt;But even Californians economizing on water in the midst of a drought may be surprised at what has happened to water withdrawals in America since 1970. Expert projections made in the 1970s showed rising water use to the year 2000, but what actually happened was a leveling off. While America added 80 million people –– the population of Turkey –– American water use stayed flat. In fact, US Geological Survey data through 2010 shows that water use has now declined below the level of 1970, while production of corn, for example, has tripled (Figure 11). More efficient water use in farming and power generation contribute the most to the reduction.&lt;/i&gt;
