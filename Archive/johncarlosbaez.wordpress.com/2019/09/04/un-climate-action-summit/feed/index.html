&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I tried to explain the problem but apparently not in enough detail.

This is not how existing retirement funds work.   A retirement fund is a big collection of stocks and bonds that&#039;s supposed to keep increasing in value in a more or less exponential rate, so that lots of people can buy into it and sell out of it whenever they want.  You can think of it as a slowly rising escalator that connects many levels of a building, which people can hop on and hop off at any time.   If you buy into a retirement fund, they don&#039;t tell you &lt;em&gt;now you can&#039;t retire for decades if you want to get your money back, because your investment won&#039;t be worth anything until then&lt;/em&gt;.

I think a retirement fund that funds a project that will only see a payoff 40 years from now would be far less attractive than the ones currently used.  Existing retirement accounts like IRAs &lt;em&gt;penalize&lt;/em&gt; you from withdrawing your money sooner, but it&#039;s &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt;, and this is important to people.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  Your example of investing in a seawall around Manhattan and then not seeing any payoff (“But at least Manhattan isn’t underwater”) doesn’t seem to be a good example of the type of adaptation which the Inside Climate News piece talks about, in which the payoffs exceed the costs.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Actually I think it&#039;s a perfect example!  The payoffs to having a seawall around Manhattan exceed the costs.  However, the payoffs are of this form: &lt;em&gt;avoiding losses&lt;/em&gt;.   It will cost much more to abandon office buildings in Manhattan when they flood decades from now, than it will to build a seawall now.  (Let&#039;s say this is true: I&#039;m not really interested in whether it&#039;s true, just that situations of this sort exist.)

I think that&#039;s true for most of the &lt;em&gt;Inside Climate News&lt;/em&gt; examples.  For example, spending lots of money to make infrastructure resilient now will keep us from spending &lt;em&gt;even more&lt;/em&gt; to rebuild it later.

In short: I believe they&#039;re counting &quot;not having to spend $1 billion  that you otherwise would&quot; as a $1 billion payoff.  But currently, it&#039;s mainly governments are in the position to spend lots of money up front to avoid future losses.  That&#039;s why I mentioned bonds.

This is the problem I keep trying to explain: &lt;em&gt;how can people make money preventing disasters that will occur decades from now?&lt;/em&gt;

For small disasters one answer is &quot;insurance&quot;, but this is already not working very well for the huge fires and weather disasters we&#039;re starting to have, much less for potential disasters decades from now.

The purpose and intent of a climate fund are important enough that I think it warrants trying &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;, maybe not exactly this, but perhaps some mix of exotic financial instruments to get something started.  Certainly happy to kick around ideas.]]></description>

I thinks that&#039;s why these kind of investment bets are not common. The #1 rule in Wall Street and the insurance industry is that there must always be a counter-bet to every bet. No one will take up the counter if it involves global destruction, as the counter-bet winner can&#039;t benefit from the outcome.

But this is all economic game-theory anyways and we all know that&#039;s an intractable pit to fall into.]]></description>

Hi John,

You wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and cited a piece which argues that the payoffs of adaptation far exceed the costs.

So basically the problem is that in theory it would be a good business model for a company to work on adaptation, however it&#039;s not clear who would invest when they won&#039;t see payoff for decades.  An answer is, retirement funds!  A retirement fund would be fine investing in something that doesn&#039;t see payoff for decades, because a retirement fund doesn&#039;t need to see payoff until decades later.  (If you wanted to invest some money and see payoff earlier, you wouldn&#039;t put that money in your retirement fund!)

Your example of investing in a seawall around Manhattan and then not seeing any payoff (&quot;But at least Manhattan isn&#039;t underwater&quot;) doesn&#039;t seem to be a good example of the type of adaptation which the &lt;em&gt;Inside Climate News&lt;/em&gt; piece talks about, in which the payoffs &lt;em&gt;exceed&lt;/em&gt; the costs.]]></description>

  I’m especially interested in ways for people to make money by preventing a disaster that will take decades to happen.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Derivatives are basically financial insurance.  One could maybe imagine a fund that sells put options to insure various climate risks, &lt;em&gt;and then allocates all the proceeds to prevent that risk from becoming a reality&lt;/em&gt;.   It is unusual for derivatives to have time to expiry in the decades, true, but maybe possible.  So in this fund structure, you would ideally run net-0 profits over the long-term, if all went well.  If you get called on the options?....and you&#039;ve spent all the money?...well disaster has struck and it won&#039;t matter anyway.]]></description>

  Well, it’s actually very common for people to invest in such assets, they’re called retirement funds. Maybe someone could make a retirement fund which invests in adaptation?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

How would this work?

Right now it works like this: suppose New York wants to build a seawall around Manhattan.  Their government essentially takes out a loan by selling bonds; the interest costs them money but the government has decided the benefits exceed the costs.  My retirement fund will invest in New York&#039;s bonds if it believes New York will survive and pay the interest (called &quot;dividends&quot;).

Or, if someone starts a company that builds solar power plants, it can sell stock to get going.  My retirement fund will buy this stock if it believes this company will make money and its stock will go up.

In both cases I&#039;m simplifying a process that actually has more layers.  But in both cases we have an entity &lt;em&gt;other than&lt;/em&gt; my retirement fund that has decided to sell bonds or stock because they&#039;ve decided it&#039;s worthwhile to them.  If it&#039;s a company, &quot;worthwhile&quot; means &quot;will help us make a profit&quot;.  If it&#039;s government, &quot;worthwhile&quot; means whatever they want --- it can mean &quot;will help us prevent a loss&quot;.

In either case, my retirement fund decides to buy this stuff because they believe they can sell it for more money later on... more or less whenever they want, barring a financial crisis.

My retirement fund is not going to take my money and spend it on  a seawall around Manhattan, because then when I retire they&#039;d have to say &quot;Sorry --- we&#039;ve spent your retirement money!  But at least Manhattan isn&#039;t underwater!&quot;

My retirement fund is also not going to take my money and spend it to build solar power plants... because they don&#039;t need to: they can just invest in companies that do.   And they do!

So what are you proposing that&#039;s new?

I&#039;m especially interested in ways for people to make money by &lt;em&gt;preventing a disaster that will take decades to happen&lt;/em&gt;.]]></description>

<p>Right now it works like this: suppose New York wants to build a seawall around Manhattan.  Their government essentially takes out a loan by selling bonds; the interest costs them money but the government has decided the benefits exceed the costs.  My retirement fund will invest in New York&#8217;s bonds if it believes New York will survive and pay the interest (called &#8220;dividends&#8221;).</p>
<p>Or, if someone starts a company that builds solar power plants, it can sell stock to get going.  My retirement fund will buy this stock if it believes this company will make money and its stock will go up.</p>
<p>In both cases I&#8217;m simplifying a process that actually has more layers.  But in both cases we have an entity <em>other than</em> my retirement fund that has decided to sell bonds or stock because they&#8217;ve decided it&#8217;s worthwhile to them.  If it&#8217;s a company, &#8220;worthwhile&#8221; means &#8220;will help us make a profit&#8221;.  If it&#8217;s government, &#8220;worthwhile&#8221; means whatever they want &#8212; it can mean &#8220;will help us prevent a loss&#8221;.</p>
<p>In either case, my retirement fund decides to buy this stuff because they believe they can sell it for more money later on&#8230; more or less whenever they want, barring a financial crisis.</p>
<p>My retirement fund is not going to take my money and spend it on  a seawall around Manhattan, because then when I retire they&#8217;d have to say &#8220;Sorry &#8212; we&#8217;ve spent your retirement money!  But at least Manhattan isn&#8217;t underwater!&#8221;</p>
<p>My retirement fund is also not going to take my money and spend it to build solar power plants&#8230; because they don&#8217;t need to: they can just invest in companies that do.   And they do!</p>
<p>So what are you proposing that&#8217;s new?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m especially interested in ways for people to make money by <em>preventing a disaster that will take decades to happen</em>.</p>

Thanks for your comment. I didn&#039;t want to seem to ignore it, so I just want to say that I agree. Now that so many people are caring who did not before, and the conversation is expanding more than ever, it does not seem impossible that the public may reverse this preconceived aversion to nuclear.

However as you say, the time to build plants is a significant limitation. Do you know of any efforts which are along this idea of &quot;SpaceX&quot; nuclear production? In general, how do you keep up with developments in this sphere? Thank you.]]></description>

Well, I would certainly never question the wisdom of Megadeath! :)

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;You’d think it would pay to save the planet, but how do we monetize it?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;http://d28jgulqbmbful.cloudfront.net/EarthSWF.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;I wrote this&lt;/a&gt;, which is an effort to articulate an idea I had centering around virtual citizenship along with a bit more detailed description of the fund structure I commented on. Maybe discussions can be had by anyone interested? I believe there is a way to do this, and I definitely think it&#039;s the time to do this.  Anyway, would be happy to hear anyone&#039;s thoughts.]]></description>
