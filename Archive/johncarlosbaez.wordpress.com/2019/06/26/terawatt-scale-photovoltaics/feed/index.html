@G. J. Smeets,

Ironically probably the best fossil fuel generation for backup is not explosive methane, but, rather, something like coal or biomass. Gas requires a piping infrastructure which both needs to be maintained and is a source of leaks.

Of course, the problem of emissions for flying will need to be solved. Even though tropospheric flight with electricity might be solved, long range will need something else.  I haven&#039;t examined it, but it seems to me that Hydrogen combustion might have specific impulse high enough.  I suspect, though, based upon experience with Hydrogen for rockets, containment might be a problem, needing heavy tanks or heavy refrigeration.

There is, of course, Sir David King&#039;s proposal for long haul transport using robust dirigibles.  One could imagine a luxury liner version of these.

Agree. No use to burn every fossil bridge down. I guess the oil industry by now is figuring out how to change their business model from ‘delivery’ to ‘back-up’.]]></description>

You could also have a regional nuclear conflict that induces a &quot;nuclear winter&quot;. An additional coupling that isn&#039;t much talked about is that another downside (of many) to using &quot;solar radiation management&quot; (Broecker, Keith, among others) to limit temperatures from high concentrations of CO2 is that it would similarly affect PV generation.

I think that&#039;s an argument against nuclear conflict and SRM and not an impediment to PV.

I also estimate a truly planetary scale caldera-sized eruption (think Yellowstone from about 800 kya) would have consequences far more pervasive than energy loss, e.g., loss of food supply, and these would happen whether or not energy was from PV.]]></description>

Maybe keep some fossil fuel plants around for emergencies like this?  (Emergencies of sub-planetary scale are more likely.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post as usual. People don&#039;t realize how much of a problem electricity storage is when it comes to PV. The best analysis on the matter is given by a 5 year old asking &quot;how solar devices work at night?&quot; well, batteries of course!
I believe that all electrochemists in the world should work on getting the best batteries possible in terms of charge cycles, charging times, voltage capacity, etc.]]></description>

The basic problem of &quot;pumping energy into a system in a way that  we can get it back out later at reasonable efficiency&quot; seems broad enough that there must be many possible solutions.  So I&#039;m pretty optimistic that if enough PV is installed so that &quot;daytime power&quot; becomes significantly cheaper than &quot;nighttime power&quot;, people will be able to come up with methods of turning one into the other, and the storage problem will be solved pretty quickly.]]></description>

I think &quot;the solar resource&quot; is not the Sun, but rather the resource of solar power as it&#039;s available to us.  This depends on how cloudy it is, where you can build solar power plants, and other stuff.

But it&#039;s true that scientific prose often tries to sound sort of fancy.]]></description>
