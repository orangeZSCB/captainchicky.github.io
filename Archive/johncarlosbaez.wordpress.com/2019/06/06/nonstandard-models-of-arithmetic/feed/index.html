True.  I notice that while the original definition of a googolplex may have been imprecise, it&amp;apos;s still definitely less than the standardized definition (1 googolplex = 10^(1 googol), where 1 googol = 10^100).]]></description>

Ahh, but then 7 might be non-standard for my golden retriever!

This reminds me of the passage in Kasner and Newman&#039;s &lt;em&gt;Mathematics and the Imagination&lt;/em&gt;, where they introduce the googolplex:

&lt;em&gt;The name &quot;googol&quot; was invented by a child...At the same time that he suggested &quot;googol&quot; he gave a name for a still larger number: &quot;Googolplex&quot;.... It was first suggested that a googolplex should be 1, followed by writing zeros until you got tired.... but different people get tired at different times and it would never do to have Carnera a better mathematician than Dr. Einstein, simply because he had more endurance.&lt;/em&gt;

(Primo Carnera was a heavy-weight champion boxer.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2019/06/06/nonstandard-models-of-arithmetic/#comment-150013&quot;&gt;Ishi Crew&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;em&gt;Seems about right that the Paris-Harrington theorem does not hold in some NSA models.&lt;/em&gt;

(One should say, the Paris-Harrington &lt;em&gt;principle&lt;/em&gt; does not hold... The Paris-Harrington theorem is the fact that the PH principle isn&#039;t provable in Peano arithmetic.)

In fact, one of the original proofs by Paris and Harrington consisted of constructing an NSA in which the Paris-Harrington principle doesn&#039;t hold. However, you don&#039;t get that model anywhere nearly so easily as by invoking the Löwenheim-Skolem theorem---the argument requires intricate combinatorics plus  ingenious logic. See Part 9 of the series in diagonalargument.com for a quick sketch, and the book by Katz &#038; Reimann for more details.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am commenting partly to &#039;bookmark&#039; this page.  When I see the name Yessenin-Volpin (and also Edward Nelson) i put this in my &#039;curiosities&#039; section--the armadillo of math. .

arXiv has papers on Russian mathematical history involving Volpin
(I think Y-V&#039;s assistant Catherine  Hennix  has some very weird music on youtube; Nelson had his own &#039;stochastic mechanics&#039; theory which looked equivalent to Bohmian mechanics to me). Doron Zeilberger (of Rutgers) is another ultrafinitist with an amusing web site (eg &#039;pi is not a number&#039;; and he cites a paper by a German physicist who claimed to have a local hidden variable theory of QM---Zeilberger said he didn&#039;t endorse the theory. ).

Seems about right that the Paris-Harrington theorem does not hold in some NSA models. You might get that from Lowenheim-Skolem theorem. (There is the related Goodstein&#039;s theorem, implemented as the &#039;hydra game&#039; in computer graphics).

There is a small &#039;cottage industry&#039; --mostly non-academics, though some academics---devoted to disproving Godel&#039;s theorem, Cantor&#039;s diagonal argument, etc. (Even Nelson tried to prove Peano arithmetic was inconsistant as have a few other mathematical logicians.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like that argument that 7 may be nonstandard, since it takes 7 symbols to write a proof that 7 exists, and that&amp;apos;s too long to be acceptable, since &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; nonstandard number n has a proof of length n that it exists.  I argue that 7 definitely &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; exist, but only because it&#039;s feasible (meaning that it exists in the world of ultrafinitism, unlike 2^100).  I know that 7 exists, because here is the proof: SSSSSS1.  Yeah, I know, that took 7 symbols, but this isn&amp;apos;t some circular argument that 7 exists because that proof exists because 7 exists; 7 exists because the proof exists because it&amp;apos;s right there in front of me!  But that only works because 7 is feasible; you can&amp;apos;t argue like that with 2^100.  (Since we&amp;apos;re working in PA, rather than in some ultrafinitist system, we can prove that 2^100 exists in some other way, then prove that the proof of length 2^100 exists as well.  But we can&amp;apos;t &lt;em&gt;start&lt;/em&gt; with the proof of length 2^100, whereas we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; start work the proof of length 7, because 7 is feasible.)]]></description>
