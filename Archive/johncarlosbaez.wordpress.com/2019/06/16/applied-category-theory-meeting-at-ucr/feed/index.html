Sorry to hear about the delayed promotion. You certainly have done a great, literally outstanding, job of educating and motivating a wide swath of those interested in categories. How that fits into the goals of  the UCR administration, perhaps focused on those enrolled at UCR rather than a broader audience, that is an interesting question, one perhaps you might want to discuss publicly someday. (BTW, there&#039;s that old joke about academic politics. Don&#039;t know if that&#039;s relevant.) Anyhow, I, and probably many others, very much appreciate the choices you have made.]]></description>

We don&#039;t have support for that.  We may try to make videos of the talks like we did &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ACT2017/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;last time&lt;/a&gt;.   Luckily we have gotten better at making videos.  But we&#039;ll see: all of us will be pretty busy talking to everyone else who is here.]]></description>

I just don&#039;t do as much of it as some others do.  As a result, I was denied a promotion.  Luckily I got that promotion this year.  I guess the delay cost me $48,000.   Probably worse was the feeling that the work I put into what I&#039;m actually good at was not appreciated.

Luckily, it was one particular administrator who was responsible for this, not the university as a whole.  And this person was kicked out of their administrative position---not because of me, but because they had managed to annoy literally hundreds of faculty in various ways.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Kudos to you for organizing this thing! And thanks for all your work on spreading the word on the many uses of category theory.

One thing I wonder (and also appreciate!) 
How do/did you manage to avoid having your time and energy sucked into all the administrative **** that universities seem to demand/expect of their profs? The ratio I heard years ago was profs were rated/expected to perform 1/3 each for teaching, research, and &quot;service&quot;. (which meant administrative duties).

Anyhow, thanks again for your very real service to the categorical community.]]></description>
