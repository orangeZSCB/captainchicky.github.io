&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Faint young Sun paradox: An unresolved question is how a climate suitable for life was maintained on Earth over the long timescale despite the variable solar output and wide range of terrestrial conditions.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Its innovative concrete and cement products allow for CO2 savings of up to 70 percent compared to standard Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) products.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;What if, instead of sending more CO2 into the atmosphere, cement could store it away?&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Although consumption for lighting dropped as a result of the DST adoption, consumption for heating and cooling increased by 2% to 4%.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The basic system, Osorio says, is also being applied toward different goals: Instead of just minimizing commuting times, it is also being used to minimize fuel consumption,...&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Drivers use about 30 percent less gas when using a roundabout compared with a traffic signal, according to the Institute, because they don’t necessarily have to stop and idle.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>
