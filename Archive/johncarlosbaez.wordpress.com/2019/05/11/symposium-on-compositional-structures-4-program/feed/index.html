					<description><![CDATA[My grad student Kenny Courser gave a talk at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2019/05/11/symposium-on-compositional-structures-4-program/&quot;&gt;4th Symposium on Compositional Structures&lt;/a&gt;.  He spoke about his work with Christina Vasilakopolou and me.  We&#039;ve come up with a theory that can handle a broad class of open systems, from electrical circuits to chemical reaction networks to Markov processes and Petri nets.   The idea is to treat open systems as morphisms in a category of a particular kind: a &#039;structured cospan category&#039;.

Here is his talk:

					<description><![CDATA[My grad student Christian Williams and I finished this paper just in time for him to talk about it at &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2019/05/11/symposium-on-compositional-structures-4-program/&quot;&gt;SYCO&lt;/a&gt;:

• John Baez and Christian Williams, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05636&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Enriched Lawvere theories for operational semantics&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Abstract.&lt;/b&gt;  Enriched Lawvere theories are a generalization of Lawvere theories that allow us to describe the operational semantics of formal systems. For example, a graph-enriched Lawvere theory describes structures that have a graph of operations of each arity, where the vertices are operations and the edges are rewrites between operations. Enriched theories can be used to equip systems with operational semantics, and maps between enriching categories can serve to translate between different forms of operational and denotational semantics. The Grothendieck construction lets us study all models of all enriched theories in all contexts in a single category. We illustrate these ideas with the SKI-combinator calculus, a variable-free version of the lambda calculus, and with Milner&#039;s calculus of communicating processes.

					<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s my talk for &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2019/05/11/symposium-on-compositional-structures-4-program/&quot;&gt;SYCO4&lt;/a&gt; next week:

• &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/SYCO4/syco4_web.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Props in network theory&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Abstract.&lt;/b&gt; To describe systems composed of interacting parts, scientists and engineers draw diagrams of networks: flow charts, Petri nets, electrical circuit diagrams, signal-flow graphs, chemical reaction networks, Feynman diagrams and the like. All these different diagrams fit into a common framework: the mathematics of symmetric monoidal categories. Two complementary approaches are presentations of props using generators and relations (which are more algebraic in flavor) and structured cospan categories (which are more geometrical). In this talk we focus on the former. A &quot;prop&quot; is a strict symmetric monoidal category whose objects are tensor powers of a single generating object. We will see that props are a flexible tool for describing many kinds of networks.
