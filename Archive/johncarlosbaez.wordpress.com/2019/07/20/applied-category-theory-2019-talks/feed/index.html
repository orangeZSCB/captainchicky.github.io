The talks at the conference were not videotaped.   But the talk slides are all available &lt;a href=&quot;http://conferences.inf.ed.ac.uk/ct2019/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  By clicking on a few of the icons at the programme at the ct2019 website, I see a video of Cheng’s social awareness talk is available.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yes, &lt;a href=&quot;https://media.ed.ac.uk/media/Category+Theory+July+2019+Eugenia+Cheng+Public+Lecture/1_5hy0j4ne&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;it&#039;s here&lt;/a&gt;.   But that was a public lecture, held in a different location from all the other talks.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  Was Peter Johnstone one of the participants?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yes, I saw a fair amount of him there.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  If he offered any thoughts to the participants (maybe a comment in a discussion), that would certainly be interesting.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I didn&#039;t hear him talk about that.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  Also, any word on the status of his 15-year-delayed Vol. 3 to “Elephant”.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

No word.  I wouldn&#039;t call it &quot;delayed&quot;.   It just takes time to write big books.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[JB, a few questions about the preceding big CT2019 conference:

1) Are there videos available of many/any of those talks? 
Search on CT2019 at youtube turns up zilch. 
By clicking on a few of the icons at the programme at the ct2019 website, I see a video of Cheng&#039;s social awareness talk is available, but the other icons (like for your talk) I have tried yield slides.
That certainly is the most useful thing, but videos would be nice too.
Not your responsibility, but just wondering about the considerations of the organizers of those big, and important, conferences.

2) Was Peter Johnstone one of the participants?
If so, I would imagine he was pleased at the generalizations of topoi in the Riehl/Verity talk. 
If he offered any thoughts to the participants (maybe a comment in a discussion), that would certainly be interesting.
Also, any word on the status of his 15-year-delayed Vol. 3 to &quot;Elephant&quot;. 
Is that project moribund?
If you feel there was anything worth sharing...

Thanks to you and your colleagues for making the ACT2019 talks so accessible :-)]]></description>
