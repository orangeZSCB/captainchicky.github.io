Well their data is used to build targets for topological strings (as per later Okounkov w/ Mina etc), so what sort of changing the targets from X to Y do we need that we want to be in Hom(X,Y). Just a start for the ever daunting physical theorem to mathematical definition process.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is kind of a stretch, but who else to ask?

The objects in the ever-astounding field of &quot;symplectic resolutions&quot; are complex symplectic (not K&#228;hler -- the 2-form is (2,0) not (1,1)) manifolds whose affinization map $latex X \to \mathrm{Spec}(\mathrm{Fun}(X))$ is birational. As you know, the morphisms $latex \mathrm{Hom}(M,N)$ are the Lagrangians in $latex (-M)\times N$.

However, it appears to me that this isn&#039;t quite the right category -- the manifolds should come equipped with a symplectic circle action with compact fixed-point set. It&#039;s then very interesting (Maulik-Okounkov&#039;s approach to R-matrices) to consider changing the circle action on a given symplectic resolution.

Have you run into this wrinkle? In particular, do you know what the morphisms in this richer category should be?]]></description>

Sorry, didn&#039;t mean to post off-topic :)  I was reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://vcp.med.harvard.edu/papers/crnt.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt; which mentions fixed points, and also looking at the &#039;biochemical coupling through emergent conservation laws&#039; paper, and just trying to figure out where everything fit in.  I&#039;ve been starting to work on some large-scale distributed graph code, so I was just wondering what was being done in this area.  Thanks for the links!  They give me a good sense of what is being done.]]></description>

The talk here has nothing to do with chemical reaction networks.  But anyway: there are people who do calculations with fairly large graphs in chemical reaction network theory.  Here are a few papers I know:

&#8226; Jakob L. Andersen, Christoph Flamm, Daniel Merkle, and Peter F. Stadler, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4006&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Generic strategies for chemical space exploration&lt;/a&gt;.

&#8226; Jakob L. Andersen, Christoph Flamm, Daniel Merkle, Peter F. Stadler, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02481&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;A software package for chemically inspired graph transformation&lt;/a&gt;.

&#8226; Omar A. Khalil, Farshad Harirchi, Doohyun Kim, Sijia Liu, Paolo Elvati, Angela Violi and Alfred O. Hero, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06281&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Model reduction in chemical reaction networks: a data-driven sparse-learning approach&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi John,

Do you feel like any of this research (chemical reaction networks generally) might benefit from computations/analysis/simulations over very large graphs?]]></description>
