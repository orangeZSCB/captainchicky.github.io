Applied category theory is very general, so it&#039;s hard to fully capture it without writing something extremely long.   But my students and I have specific reasons for working on it.  That&#039;s what this seminar is about.  That&#039;s what my talk was about.  And that&#039;s what I thought the question was about: not generalities, but what we&#039;re actually doing here.

The questioner did, after all, also ask:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  Is there any goal that you want to achieve in the end?  Do you want to find/construct a unified language for all the diverse topics you discuss on the slides and on the seminar?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The short answers are &quot;yes: saving the planet&quot; and &quot;yes: and indeed we&#039;ve partially done this and want to continue&quot;.  I wanted to give a slightly longer answer, with links to even longer ones.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That is a great overview of the global warming
crisis.  Full of facts to put the issue in context.

A study came out in the PNAS last year 
entitled &quot;The biomass distribution on Earth&quot;. 
I found some of its results surprising.  For 
the last 20 years i thought subterranean 
prokaryotes constituted the bulk of the 
Earth&#039;s biomass.  Before that i thought it 
was plankton.  According to this study plants 
make up over 80% of the Earth&#039;s biomass.

If true it would put a different perspective
on all sorts of human-plant interactions.

https://www.pnas.org/content/115/25/6506.short

I hesitate to add that it seems that plants
make up the bulk of the biomass on the Moon
today.

The phrase &quot;applied category theory&quot; is ambiguous. There are a lot of things that could be called &quot;applied category theory&quot;, and taking those into account, it wouldn&#039;t be right to say &quot;the grand vision of [applied category theory] is to develop a language for science which is suitable for understanding and designing open systems and networks of all kinds&quot;. There are huge swaths of interface between category theory and computer science which deserve to be considered applied category theory, for example.

Words matter, and I really wish people would make an effort to find a less ambiguous term for this burgeoning area. A number of people have urged this, but maybe it&#039;s already too late?]]></description>

The grand vision is to develop a language for science which is suitable for understanding and designing &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_system_(systems_theory)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;open systems&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_theory&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;networks&lt;/a&gt; of all kinds.  This is a step towards &#039;ecotechnology&#039;: technology that works &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; nature and works &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; nature instead of gobbling up resources and spewing out waste.

Concepts from category theory &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; play a role in most of the topics being discussed in the seminar.  The one place where it&#039;s not completely apparent is &quot;social contagion on networks&quot;, but that&#039;s just because the people working on that probably don&#039;t realize how natural it is to study contagion processes on &lt;em&gt;open&lt;/em&gt; networks using category theory: this is the sort of thing my students and I could easily do.

For just a tiny bit more information, try my &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/networks_1.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;manifesto&lt;/a&gt; from 2011.  This is the first of a long series of articles, but we&#039;ve done a lot more by now so scanning our &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;papers&lt;/a&gt; might be a next step.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice overview!

My understanding is that you want to save the planet with you research, right? I can&#039;t yet understand, how category theory can help here.

or, asking differently,

What is the grand idea or vision behind applied category theory (aka, what&#039;s the point)?
Is there any goal that you want to achieve in the end?
Do you want to find/construct a unified language for all the diverse topics you discuss on the slides and on the seminar?
Do you want to introduce concepts from category theory into these topics?]]></description>

I passed  the link to your lecture above to the person leading the  i group i&#039;m in----i don&#039;t know if he&#039;ll look at it, but perhaps.

the link below is by a U Wash professor of engineering (seems to be pretty &#039;hardcore&#039;---mostly applied, but his Duke PhD was on chaos in Duffing&#039;s equation.  )

He does this blog &#039;on the side&#039;---very nontechnical, but  similar to the kinds of presentations i&#039;ve seen in activist trainings and in community action trainings.

https://empathy.guru/fundamental-set-of-knowledge-structures

As you say out programmers, many can write a program in a day  , and other people can make very complex diagrams also in a day , and some can actually translate those diagrams to calculate something (eg Feynman diagrams).  Some of us are not good at much of anything.

(Turned out we got from 9 to 12 inches of snow today.  Nice, but not a good advertizement to act on AGW.

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Besides the &#039;green new deal&#039;, other peole are talking about  industrial agriculture and universal basic income---though many of the proposals for UBI---eg the one by Chris Hughes of Facebook or Van Parijis in Belgium---are poorly thought out--almost look like trojan horses.  The best &#039;basic income&#039;  proposals seem to be  based on Thomas Paine and  Henry George style property/land/resource taxes, and a Negative income tax.   )
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;]]></description>

I&#039;ve repeatedly tried to find out how well carbon offsets actually work: it&#039;s hard. There are organizations devoted to this question, for example:

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;https://americancarbonregistry.org/how-it-works/what-we-do&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;American Carbon Registry&lt;/a&gt;

You should only use carbon offsets that are accredited with some reputable organization of this sort.  But even so, I&#039;ve read stories about people planting lots of trees but then not taking care of them well enough: this sort of things needs constant monitoring.  The great advantage of just &lt;em&gt;not flying&lt;/em&gt; is that it&#039;s so much simpler!]]></description>
