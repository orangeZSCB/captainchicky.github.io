Okay, that works.

Anyway, thanks very much!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[With respect to the interview, just a question:
 What kind of patterns do you think are mostly  shared by people who like mathematics (or physics and science in general)? What traits are more useful in your opinion when facing the daily life (not the scientific like, the another side of the life, you know what I mean...I presume)? 
Yes, there are a lot of interesting things out there, but the power of math and why it finds hard to many understand why (even the actors) is related to a surprising sentence I read from you here &quot;(...).It seems only certain people are drawn to mathematics, and that’s fine: there are many wonderful things in life and there’s no need for everyone explore all of them. Mathematics seems to attract people who enjoy patterns, who enjoy precision, and who don’t want to remember lists of arbitrary facts (...)&quot;
Is Mathematics or Physics simple? I had recently different discussions about the difficulties of some topics in these subjects. 
By the way, great sentence by Maryam Mirzakhani...A terrible lost for the whole mathematical world. No doubt about that. I did not know the quote. Thanks for sharing it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2019/01/01/interview/#comment-140241&quot;&gt;John Baez&lt;/a&gt;.

OH, that feeling is similiar to my own feelings. I understand what you mean. If you visit Spain some day in the future, let me know. And yes, I am also happier when busy to not think too much about my not accomplishments...Cheers!!!!
P.S. (long): By the way, have a look about the Vinti integral paper (I think I mentioned you already in another comment) and the Carter constant-like topic http://inspirehep.net/record/1677519/ MICZ-Kepler problems are a thing I want to read whenever I become healthier than now. But yet, I survive. Not a bad thing. I want to see the next KBO flyby (If I am fortunated I will...) and the finding of life out of Earth but in the Solar System. I believe the odds are high for that within the next decade. Extrasolar planet searches will be improved to find out atmospheres and elements for life. Next decade is going to be central for many astrobiologists...Hopefully, new wonders in Astronomy and Astrophysics as well. New exciting times. String theory has a lacking problem joined to its virtue. But also loop quantum gravity is not a complete theory. We need a push in experimental searches for quantum gravity. AI will emerge soon and maybe it will handle these problems better than we can, however I presume there is yet a 95% or the Universe waiting for us to discovery. And that is a fantastic trip of exploration. One that deserves attention, readers and funding (Have we passed the Great Filter? I think we haven&#039;t yet).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I shared this interview to explain the way mathematicians see things (or at least one) .
That frog is quite beautiful---i see fewer and fewer of the rare amphibians, reptiles, fish etc that are in this area. (&#039;mid atlantic region&#039; which ranges from 0 ft above sea level up to about 4800 feet which has a bit of a subarctic climate).  I am more of a historian than mathematician or musician.  robots can replace me easily.

Thanks, and Happy New Year!

Sometimes I&#039;m proud of what I&#039;ve done, but just as often I&#039;m dissatisfied.  I could write a long essay about how I&#039;ve failed to live up to my goals, but I&#039;ll spare you that.  I try not to worry about whether I&#039;ll be remembered or whether I&#039;ve done anything worth remembering: I&#039;m happier when I&#039;m too busy to think about such things.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Happy New Year 2019 too, John C. Baez. Your TWF or Azimuth or your contributions in n-category cafe and many other great sites and ideas are to be remembered. You must be very proud of those things you teach us all, and the flame you are able to ignite with your deep passion for mathematics as a tool to solve problems everywhere and everytime. For all these reasons, and many others you probably know from other eager readers, have a nice new Year (Ultima Thule, Osiris-Rex and soon upgraded LIGO to search for GW).]]></description>
