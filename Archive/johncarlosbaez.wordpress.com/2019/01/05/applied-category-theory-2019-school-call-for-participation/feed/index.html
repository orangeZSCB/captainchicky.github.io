Daniel and Jules have now sent out acceptance letters to those who got into the ACT2019 school.  They&#039;re a remarkably talented group of people!   Here are some basic statistics:

Total applicants: 119 
Accepted applicants: 24 (20% of total) 
Female applicants: 15 (13% of total) 
Female applicants accepted: 5 (21% of accepted)]]></description>

I don&#039;t think it&#039;s restricted to students and postdocs---I just think the people who wrote the ad didn&#039;t think about this point.   Other people have asked me the same question, and I&#039;m telling them: go ahead and apply!  We&#039;ll look at all applications.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;
  As part of a new growing community in Applied Category Theory, now with a dedicated journal Compositionality, a traveling workshop series SYCO, a forthcoming Cambridge U. Press book series Reasoning with Categories, and several one-off events including at NIST, we launch an annual conference+school series named Applied Category Theory, the coming one being at Oxford, July 15-19 for the conference, and July 22-26 for the school. The dates are chosen such that CT 2019 (Edinburgh) and the ACT 2019 conference (Oxford) will be back-to-back, for those wishing to participate in both.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  There already was a successful invitation-only pilot, ACT 2018, last year at the Lorentz Centre in Leiden, also in the format of school+workshop.
  
  For the conference, for those who are familiar with the successful QPL conference series, we will follow a very similar format for the ACT conference.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>
