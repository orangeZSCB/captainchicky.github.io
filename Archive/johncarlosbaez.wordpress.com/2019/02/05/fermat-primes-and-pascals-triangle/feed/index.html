					<description><![CDATA[am interested in the history of fractals and wonder who 1st called the sierpinski gasket a fractal... the word fractal seems to date mid 20th century but many fractals were discovered earlier, think it would be really great if someone built a comprehensive timeline. anyone up for the challenge? maybe mathworld/ weisstein? btw have found many fractal properties in the collatz conjecture last few yrs, alas few else have noticed, invite anyone to drop by for further discussion :)]]></description>

Of course, and that explains why John deleted that from his comment too!  That&#039;s good then, not have even that exception.  I was probably mixing up the Fermat numbers $latex F_n = 2^{2^n} + 1$ with the Mersenne numbers $latex M_n = 2^n - 1$.

(These also have an associated primality conjecture, that $latex M_n$ is prime whenever $latex n$ is, although it&#039;s much quicker to see that this is false.  And the converse, that $latex n$ is prime whenever $latex M_n$ is, is actually true!  Since $latex M_0 = 0$, this even lets you be perfectly ambiguous about whether to accept $latex 0$ as prime.)]]></description>

Ah, but 1 is not a Fermat number anyway, since one should add 1 to a power of 2, not subtract it.]]></description>

You included it in Puzzle 1, so maybe they&#039;ll be confused when it doesn&#039;t appear this time?  I was.

But I like how this bootstraps the beginning of the Fermat numbers.  I say ‘I want a Fermat number!’.  You say ‘Well, just multiply together the ones that you have, then add 2.’ (which doesn&#039;t work if I obtain them out of order, but never mind that for now).  I reply ‘But I don&#039;t have &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; Fermat numbers yet!’, but you reply ‘Don&#039;t worry, just do what I said: multiply all none of them together to get 1, then add 2 to get 3.’ and now I&#039;ve got my first Fermat number out of nothing.

(As the original version of your comment noted, 1 could itself be considered a non-prime Fermat number, since $latex 1 = 2^{2^0} - 1$, but that breaks both puzzles, so let&#039;s forbid it.)]]></description>

I considered it but thought it might confuse some people.  You should be be glad to know that at least I felt a pang of guilt for leaving it out!]]></description>
