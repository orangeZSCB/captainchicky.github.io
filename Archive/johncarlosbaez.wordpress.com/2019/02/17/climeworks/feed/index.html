					<description><![CDATA[If we&#039;re exploring various methods to achieve negative carbon emissions, a key aspect is figuring out economically viable pathways to scale up those methods.  They&#039;ll start small and they&#039;ll inevitably be expensive at first.  The ones that get big will get cheaper---per tonne of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; removed---as they grow.

This has various implications.  For example, suppose someone builds a machine that sucks CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the air and uses it to make carbonated soft drinks and to make plants grow better in greenhouses.  As I mentioned, &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2019/02/17/climeworks/&quot;&gt;Climeworks&lt;/a&gt; is actually doing this!

In one sense, this is utterly pointless for fighting climate change, because these markets only use 6 megatonnes of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; annually---less than 0.02% of how much CO₂ we&#039;re dumping into the atmosphere!

But on the other hand, if this method of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; scrubbing can be scaled up and become cheaper and cheaper, it&#039;s useful to start exploring the technology now.  It could be the first step along some economically viable pathway.]]></description>

@John Baez,

The late Wally Broecker in his talk at BU reported that he and a colleague estimated that to stop increases in forcing from CO2, a system would need to be established that consumed the world&#039;s entire annual supply of Sulfur and converted it into Sulfuric Acid droplets to achieve the albedo hack of solar geoengineering.

Don&#039;t know if David Keith at Harvard has improved on that at all.]]></description>

@alex_sehdeva,

There are tough energy requirements here. Trouble is, those two bonds holding onto the Oxygen atoms &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;are covalent double bonds&lt;/a&gt; requiring a substantial investment of energy to break. Note that photosynthesis demands energy from light, typically, insolation.]]></description>

@Rogier Brussee,

I see such capture as less as response to direct emissions as a mechanism which could be used after cessation to help bring down climate (atmosphere + ocean) CO2 concentrations. Going after direct emissions is a fool&#039;s errand, as they&#039;ll increase as pricier sources of fossil fuels are found and exploited.

Also keeping up with emissions is tough ... You calculated quantity, but what&#039;s capacity per unit time?]]></description>

You might like this article I wrote:

&#8226; Azimuth Wiki, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Enhanced+weathering&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Enhanced weathering&lt;/a&gt;.

One calculation I did back then:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  A kilogram of serpentine can dispose about two-thirds of a kilogram of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. According to Wikipedia, in 2008 about 31.8 gigatonnes of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; were emitted from burning fossil fuels (and more from land use change). So, to counter that we’d need to grind up about 48 gigatonnes of serpentine a year. For comparison, total world cement production in 2009 was about 2.8 gigatonnes. The total amount of material handled by US mines in 2008 was about 5.6 gigatonnes.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So, we&#039;d need serious pressure from the government to crush enough rock to absorb the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; we&#039;re putting out now.  By 2018 we reached 37.1 gigatonnes of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, which would require 55.6 gigatonnes of ground serpentine.]]></description>

Yes, I read about their amine process. But this, unfortunately, is part of another problem for me. This amine has to be synthesized (and possibly a lot of energy is needed for that step, essentially amine synthesis traces back to the energy expensive Haber Bosch process before, that has to go into the balancing), and recycled (again, energy consuming). There will be opportunistic costs with transport of the amine etc. If the process works in principle, to solve the problem, the amine synthesis has to be scaled up considerably. I wonder, if this is chemically possible. If so, a bunch of another costs come into play, build the production plants, make some steel for them and the amine carrying train wagons, trucks, and ships (energy, energy, energy). Then, no recycling process is ever perfect. There will be amine leakage into the environment (the amines in question are somehow toxic), and degradation processes rendering them unusable (What are the chemical products of this? Could it be, that some following products are harmful? Could it be, that side products of the synthesis are harmful? Chemists have some bad experiences with scaling up products, once considered beneficial, like tetraethyllead , halocarbons, asbestos, now plastic) I do not even consider the costs of scaling up, in principle, because if this would be the solution, then we should spent the money without thinking about it. I agree, of course, that someone has to come up with ideas, that we have to test them, that it is always good to have a lot of alternatives, but in particular this approach seems not to be as thoroughly researched by now, to stir up some hope that it will be &quot;the thing&quot; to do. Ironically, if done, it would rather fix a lot of nitrogen instead of CO2.

I think, a solution could be the genetically modification of microorganisms that could fix CO2 somehow by using it for production of energetic molecules (carbohydrates) or structure materials. I mean, microorganisms DID prove their potential to change the atmosphere on a global scale when they started to produce oxygen some million years ago by exactly this process. Dead microorganisms would fix some amounts of CO2 again, like they did before in producing oil. We just have to speed up this process extremely, so that it does not take geological timescale but could keep up with our release of CO2 from fossil sources. At best, this should work without need of human interference anymore. You could think of coupling the task we would like to be performed to the well being of another organism, letting evolution doing the scaling process for you at no costs at all. If we tell these microorganisms to use nitrate and phosporus from their surroundings, or plastic, as a source of chemical energy, this would even solve some other pollution problems as well. Unfortunately, large-scale genetic modification of our environment is not a thing appreciated by &quot;green&quot; people.

I wonder, too, if nuclear fusion, if ever it could be make work to produce energy on an industrial scale, could help in solving these problems. We would need an abundant, &quot;clean&quot; source of energy to use it for caring for these problems. Until then, we should save energy, where ever we can, for sure.]]></description>
