True!   Of course, you also have to figure out where you put the carbon dioxide, or some other substance.   That might seem tricky if it starts on a barge in the ocean.  But the good news is that people are already planning to pump compressed CO2 into the Norwegian continental shelf, under the North Sea:

Okay, so nothing was wrong in what McKay said.  We need to distinguish total energy consumption from electricity consumption because the former is often about 7 times bigger.]]></description>

Yes, something funny is going here: the British are not particularly abstemious compared to other Europeans when it comes to consuming energy!

&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_energy_consumption_per_capita&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; says the UK&#039;s total power consumption per capita was about 4 kilowatts in 2013.  I find &quot;kilowatt-hours per day&quot; to be an annoying unit of power, but since there are 24 hours per day it equals 24 kilowatts, right?  So then the UK&#039;s total power consumption is 24 &#215; 4 = 96 kilowatts per day.

That&#039;s pretty close to McKay&#039;s claimed &quot;European&#039;s energy consumption energy consumption of 125 kWh per day&quot;.]]></description>

If there are ions in the dissociation CO+ and O-, then it is possible an electric drift in the chamber, and after a possible recombination with the right flows, with paths that connect carbon monoxide ions and oxygen radicals (it is possible the recovery of the light energy emitted in the recombination, like thermal or optical energy); it could be possible a increase of the concentration of the carbon dioxide step by step (it is not necessary a high concentration, but a good concentration of carbon dioxide), repeating the procedure; it could be possible the increase of the efficiency with reflective chambers, to reflect the laser photons.
I read an article
https://www.hindawi.com/journals/tswj/2014/828131/
that contain many of the methods of separation, and I think that there are many explored alternatives, but strangely this was missing (perhaps because of the ineffectiveness).]]></description>

You&#039;ve got to power your laser somehow - and you wind up with highly reactive radicals - a carbon monoxide radical and an oxygen radical. Chances are that they recombine to form CO2, unless they are immediately captured on some sort of medium or other.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Now, let’s assume that we wish to neutralize a typical European’s CO2 output of 11 tons per year, which is 30 kg per day per person. The energy required, assuming a cost of 0.55 kWh per kg of CO2, is 16.5 kWh per day per person. This is exactly the same as British electricity consumption.&quot;
Later:
&quot;At this energy cost, capturing a European’s 30 kg per day would cost 100 kWh per day – almost the same as the European’s energy consumption of 125 kWh per day.&quot;
Something wrong there... Maybe it should read &quot;almost 10 times the European energy consumption of 12.5kWh a day&quot;?
