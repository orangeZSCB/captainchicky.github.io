					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The Antikythera mechanism, found undersea in the Mediterranean, dates to somewhere between 200 and 60 BC. It’s a full-fledged analogue computer! It had at least 30 gears and could predict eclipses, even modelling changes in the Moon’s speed as it orbits the Earth.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Is this epicyclic gearing that essentially does this kind of stuff?

Many of the cheaply extractable raw materials will be conveniently stored in landfills.   &lt;img src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/emoticons/tongue2.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;

But, one can also imagine future civilizations that don&#039;t use much more than plant-based materials, rocks, sand, etc., for technology, so don&#039;t have our kind of technology, but still have interesting culture.  They might be unable to do particle physics or even quantum mechanics... but there are lots of other things to think about.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[All this talk of preserving records and that science can be rediscovered assumes that technological civilization can be re-booted.

With &lt;b&gt;all&lt;/b&gt; of the cheaply extractable raw materials gone, and much of the globe uninhabitable, what are the odds that anything will be preserved, or that anything cultural can be recreated in less than geological timescales?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2019/08/26/civilizational-collapse-part-4/#comment-153563&quot;&gt;Bob&lt;/a&gt;.

@Bob,

Some very old religious traditions believe that proper ethics, sociology (caring for the &quot;widow and the orphan&quot;), and environmental sensibility is wired into the fabric of the Cosmos. By that they mean if a society transgresses these boundaries, there are real costs associated with doing so. They don&#039;t necessary mean that individuals who are responsible for anything pay. But, to some extent, if someone arises and is permitted to do bad things, it is partly the responsibility of the society about them for failing to intervene to stop them.

Accordingly, I think, they would judge that the bad actor is a symptom of a corruption in the society, and that corruption eventually earns its own punishment.]]></description>

&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Syracuse_(film)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Archimedes&lt;/a&gt; managed to be a genius far beyond his own place and time. His bouyancy principle will likely be a &quot;gift that keeps on giving&quot;. Exceptional people like Archimedes seem to be able to manage information without becoming confounded. Their wetware wiring stays manageable and tangle-free (defragged) even when flooded with mis-information. They seem to have limitless memory and be able to digest and condense information, using it for fuel.

For others, opening a time capsule containing cheat-sheets would be a recipe for disaster, a real &quot;Pandora&#039;s Box&quot;. As the old saying goes, &quot;If you give an idiot a gun and he shoots someone with it, you don&#039;t blame the idiot.&quot;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Or is there something special about the laws of Nature, that would make mechanics always the best starting point...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some laws are just speed bumps; they&#039;re meaningful and useful in their context, but you can still get over them. Other laws will kill you if you break them. The most useful laws seem to be the ones that keep you alive long enough to appreciate them. So , if by &quot;mechanics&quot; if you mean &quot;mortality&quot;, then the supernatural (human) laws might be just as important as the natural ones. I almost gave up on the Mind-Body Problem after reading about Nicolas Malebranche&#039;s gravitational theory of &quot;swerving&quot; atoms as a basis for free-will. Laws can be perverted. It&#039;s unnerving how the 2nd Amendment can be used to build up a domestic army of insurgents who want to eliminate the Constitution. It&#039;s un-nerving that pro-lifers want to force some women into a reproductive act against their will, but for some strange reason nobody is calling that &#039;rape&#039;. Ignorance is bliss. Optimistically I would concentrate more on opening horizons, opportunities, and options rather than building arks, time capsules, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_of_the_Long_Now&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;infinity clocks&lt;/a&gt;]]></description>

Thanks!  Maybe I should tak Lucio Russo with a bigger grain of salt.  He writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  Starting with the year 212 B.C., which witnessed the plunder of Syracuse and the killing of Archimedes, Hellenistic centers were defeated and conquered by the Romans. During the second century B.C. scientific studies declined rapidly. Alexandria&#039;s scientific activity, in particular, stopped abrubtly in 145-144 B.C., when Ptolemy VIII (Euergetes II), who had just ascended the throne, initiated a policy of brutal persecution against the city&#039;s Greek ruling class. Polybius says that the Greek population of Alexandria was almost entirely destroyed at that time; Athenaeus gives a lively description of the subsequent diaspora of the city&#039;s intellectuals; other sources give a few more details. Our information is not enough to reconstruct the causes of the persecution. Subsequently, Euergetes II continued to pursue a policy hostile to the Greek community in Alexandria, turning to the indigenous ethnic groups for support. Since he had enjoyed Roman support even before ascending the throne (when, exiled by his brother, he had taken refuge in Rome), it is reasonable to think that he became a proxy for Rome&#039;s Mediterranean expansionism, which at the time was particularly violent.
  
  Rome&#039;s expansion ended in 30 B.C. with the annexation of Egypt, thus completing the unifiation of the whole Mediterranean under Roman rule. This event is usually considered as the end of the Hellenistic era, which was followed by the &quot;imperial period&quot;. From our point of view, however, it is not a particularly significant date: although the golden age of science had tragically come to an end over a century earlier, with the end of scientific activity in Alexandria and the conquest of the other main centers  by the Romans, Hellenistic culture survived during the imperial age.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

True, fossils and genes are very good in storing information. In the human context paper still comes close, maybe just rivaled by clay discs. It is also true, that science does not need a backup copy, since the laws are still all out there to rediscover. It could be a hard time, though, to do that in practice from scratch. And is it really guaranteed that some Zweistein guy of the future comes up with the same idea of relativity? Well maybe, at some level of investigation, it is inevitable to do so. One possibly would also rediscover the Planck law by necessity. But then, mankind lived most of their history without doing science at all. Would there be a second Newton to start it? Would it be ignited from another field, say thermodynamics instead? How could that shape the minds of the future scientists and predispose them for other discoveries? Or is there something special about the laws of Nature, that would make mechanics always the best starting point and the most dominant way of thinking, like it happened in the past?]]></description>

This is very interesting, and I think it works the other way round, too. As we do not always know today, what our ancestors did know, it also seems to be very difficult to know, what they did not know. The latter seems obvious, but is far from that. We cannot unlearn things. We cannot really imagine how it must have been in a time preceding the discovery of a method, say calculus. Of course, by meticulous historical study one could reconstruct both knowledge, thereby giving an exact picture of the historical knowledge at this time. But who is able to do that? This means, we will always read Newton&#039;s, and any other historical text, from our perspective, never from theirs, unless maybe we really try very, very hard, remembering the biases in our knowledge. In one way, this is lost knowledge, too, which might not be seen as that, since we think of ourselves to better understand the topic as a whole today.]]></description>
