The UK has a Hybrid Airship Company - https://www.hybridairvehicles.com/
They are planning to offer 50 ton and bigger in the future and although at the moment they are depending on diesel propellers the future ones could be largely powered from PV and batteries and or renewable H2. 
One great advance over previous Airships is the possibility of needing no ground crew or runway as they&#039;re working on an inflatable hovercraft skirt with the ability to suck the airship to the ground whilst loading and unloading.

Obviously the top speed of 100 knots and max altitude of 20,000ft means a far more civilised travelling with cabins and wonderful views.

There is also a solar powered Canadian cargo airship being built for deliveries in South Africa.]]></description>

If not heating, then at least cooking. This NYT article discusses the transition

&lt;blockquote&gt;Where are the heat-exchangers on the plumbing?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&quot;In Belgium, residential heating accounts for around 14% of total greenhouse gas emissions. Of that heat, the largest source of loss is through what goes down the drain and into the sewer.&quot;]]></description>

Okay, I‚Äôll just cause a global recession then.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Been there, done that:

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2019/08/15/carbon-offsets/#comment-153435&quot;&gt;Just donate to EA in general?&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  I am having a hard time thinking about this, because to me it is hard to stop thinking in terms of aggregate utility in general, and instead think specifically in terms of this one specific form of harm.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

You could think of it as like taking out the trash.   When my wife says to take out the trash, I should take out the trash, not buy her flowers---because there really is a reason to take out the trash.

Here however the trash is CO2, and it quickly spreads worldwide, so any form of reducing it anywhere counts as taking out the trash.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If the goal is not to reduce a personal carbon footprint, but to reduce the world&#039;s carbon footprint, then that implies some amount of indirectness is permitted. It might be that they&#039;d do best to donate to contraceptive funding in SSA, or women&#039;s education, or anti-malarial organizations.

I am having a hard time thinking about this, because to me it is hard to stop thinking in terms of aggregate utility in general, and instead think specifically in terms of this one specific form of harm. That seems a little bit at odds with the notions of offsets itself.

Are they okay with a probabilistic reduction in carbon offsets, so long as the expected value of the offset equals the expected carbon they&#039;ve emitted? Or do they need a high degree of certainty and directness to their efforts? My feeling is that the methods involving directness and high certainty will tend to be much less cost-effective.]]></description>
