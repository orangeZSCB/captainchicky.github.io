					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2014/08/28/the-stochastic-resonance-program-part-2/#comment-56069&quot;&gt;John Baez&lt;/a&gt;.

I think part of the reservation that some people who write numerical code have is that Javascript is designed to be quick to write rather than quick to execute. As such, it may feels like you need to write two copies of the program, one in a language with optimization-amenable semantics for serious use and one for the web in Javascript. I haven&#039;t tried out any of these, but maybe some from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/wiki/List-of-languages-that-compile-to-JS&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this set of languages that can be converted to Javascript&lt;/a&gt; might turn out to be more attractive. (I suspect you can&#039;t write just any program in the original language but have to stick to a subset, but it might still be more palatable.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[While Allan Erskine and Glyn Adgie were writing the first version of this program, Allan expressed some discomfort at writing it in Javascript.  Not much numerical code is written in Javascript, I guess, and maybe this is a self-reinforcing situation.  But it really seems good to have software like this that runs on a browser with no &quot;installation&quot; process required.  How can we make this easier and more fun to do?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It is interesting, a simple script to obtain a running program in each operating system; I am thinking if it is possible to apply this system to parallel calculus in a system with different operating systems, with different processors (for example a scientific computing in a growing system of different processors).

The other application could be the minimization of a function with many relative minimum points using noise-induce hops.]]></description>
