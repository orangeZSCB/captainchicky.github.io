					<description><![CDATA[I heard about this study, but have a slightly different perspective---but this is about health, rather than AGW (which i am quite familiar with). 

I don&#039;t have health insurance, and generally have dealt with those issues on my own (i mostly get broken bones (also west nile virus, lyme disease, etc.) somewhat due to my penchant for hiking (and i make stupid choices---and i know they are but i decide to take the easy path even though i suspect its the wrong one  and end up falling down a cliff), and also where i live   (so i get assaulted sometimes). 

The people i have known who go to hospitals don&#039;t get out in my experience (a small sample of course---or they go in and out and then don&#039;t come out).  So i figure why bother. 

I know alot of people in the environmental &#039;community&#039;.  Its mostly flying around the world to give lectures on what you should already know.

 I did end up in one hospital for pneumonia 2 years ago (for 6 weeks too, and it was 3500$/day (i calculated it, so maybe i get a fields medal for the math) basically not because i asked but because i mentioned i wasnt feeling well to someone (a sortuh understatement) so they took me to one.  (they could do &#039;prevention&#039;  and find me some sort of &#039;reasonable job&#039; (and i can live on 15-20G$/yr and usually on less, but they&#039;d prefer to pay me more than i earned my whole life in 6 weeks---and i have an &#039;ivy league degree&#039; and did research in math bio too (some with someone from SFI (in fact one who wrote also on electrical networks/chemical reactions isomorphism---goes back to  Katchalsky, Oster, and Kron), and help me find a job fixing up their house or in fast food or a gas station).  

War, casinos, condos, highways, sports stadiums and everything upscale seems to be the current priority.  So why bother.

If you want to study the phenomena of information aversion, one can always look at the relationship of Claremont schools to Clarement Review.  Bury your head (if you have a woded knee).]]></description>

No.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The fact is, Global Cooling was all the rage in the 1970’s, just like Global Warming is all the rage today.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I guess you didn&#039;t read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_cooling&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wikipedia article I cited&lt;/a&gt;, which demolishes this myth.  You might also try this:

&#8226; Thomas Peterson, William Connolley and John Fleck, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/2008BAMS2370.1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The myth of the 1970s global cooling consensus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society&lt;/i&gt;, September 2008.

On the off chance you&#039;re suffering from a bit of information aversity yourself, I&#039;ll quote some:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Despite active efforts to answer these questions, the following pervasive myth arose: there was a consensus among climate scientists of the 1970s that either global cooling or a full-fledged ice age was imminent (see the “Perpetuating the myth” sidebar). A review of the climate science literature from 1965 to 1979 shows this myth to be false. The myth’s basis lies in a selective misreading of the texts both by some members of the media at the time and by some observers today. In fact, emphasis on greenhouse warming dominated the scientific literature even then.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

You&#039;ll need to read the whole thing to get the detailed proof.

As mentioned before, arguing about this myth is not very productive if you want to learn what the Earth&#039;s temperature is actually doing.  But the Wikipedia article and this &lt;i&gt;Bulletin of the American Meteorologists&lt;/i&gt; article &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; give an interesting window into the &lt;i&gt;history&lt;/i&gt; of climate science.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
And what about the other articles? 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I&#039;ll be glad to talk about those, one at a time, after my readers have gotten a chance to make up their minds about this &#039;global cooling consensus&#039; business.  What I don&#039;t want is a game where you toss balls in many directions at once and then complain that I don&#039;t catch them all.]]></description>

Thank you for proving my point! You are dismissing the Newsweek article having any facts, just because Newsweek wrote it? That&#039;s a logical fallacy if I ever saw one. Even if Playboy wrote that article, it would still be a fact whether you like Playboy or not. The fact is, Global Cooling was all the rage in the 1970&#039;s, just like Global Warming is all the rage today. And yes, NASA was doing the pushing then like they are today, as well as our government and various medias, like Newsweek. And what about the other articles? You evaded and dismissed them too. Another fact that you seemed to overlook is those other three articles are all already the latest science on the subject matter. The purpose of the articles isn&#039;t so people have something to  explain away or dismiss out-of-hand or ignore because they are too overwhelming to study, but to learn from them. I know for a fact you will never ever research those articles for any facts. You have already made up your mind they aren&#039;t worth your time or trouble. That is the mark of a blind faith believer. You have demonstrated a very evasive and aversive response to what should the beginning of a scientific and logical discussion. So with all that in mind, it seems I hit the nail right on the head with my comment and I was right on track with information aversive response of people. So like I said, thank you for proving my point!]]></description>

If the temperature of your refrigerator is on the borderline of your milk spoiling or not, then you might notice the difference then, but as you demonstrated, even then it would take a long time before you noticed. Of course, your analogy is off the mark because there are no temperatures anywhere in the world that are right on the borderline of any one individual climate changing to another one, not with a mere 1.2 degree rise in temperatures like there has been in the last 100 years.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[On designing technologies for the virtual and architectural classroom--

Here are the posters I used to explain an experiment I&#039;d been allowed previously to fund at the poster session of a meeting between psychologists and game theorists called The Society for the Quantitative Analysis of Behavior. I had used psychology to design a situation for the Ultimatum Game, which for the first time showed that not just self-destructive rage can result from playing the game, but apparently for the first time, we also observed the giving of gifts.

Showing more generally that a game experimentalist can employ psychological effects in the design of technology for experimental games, technology that affects the subconsciousness of players in the game.

					<description><![CDATA[John, you should really take the opportunity to write about Game Theory in this post. Please check out this proposed reading of Theory of Games and Economic Behavior. Only a team of two players can play the game of perfect competition. Larger teams of players can form coalitions, which destroy opposing individuals. Two against one in a team of three. Three against one in a team of four. Four against one in a team of five. And so on. That&#039;s why overhearing the phrase &quot;Not a team player&quot; behind your back in the corporate world is like a whisper in your ear from the Angel of Death. 

Psychology studies of group cognition find the most effective strategy to be-- instead of form coalitions among themselves and work against outside individuals-- first find out who the smartest player is, everybody else go on coffee break and let the selected player solve the problem by self. 

But none of this holds for teams of two players. Why?

Theory of Games predicts it. Because the theorems there tell us that the team of two players lacks the capability to break itself into sub-groups. The death by coalition strategy only works in teams of more than two players.

Nobody knows this in psychology, of course. Nonetheless, their findings about dyad problem solving in the field and in laboratories comprises experimental confirmation of the theorems about dyads found in Theory of Games. Nobody has realized this because the word &quot;dyad,&quot; as I remember it, is not found anywhere in the text of Theory of Games.

Here&#039;s the core of the strategy behind the $163bn budget of the advertising industry phrased in terms of a joke:

&quot;I&#039;ve go too much on my mind to think about anything.&quot;

Billions of news bytes and meaningless information floods into our brains from advertising and the media content that it supports, with yearly funding in the amount of $163bn.

Distracted from thinking by that amount of media, the populace can think only the most primitive of thoughts. And they are threatened with death. Naturally, there is fear.

Here&#039;s a study on the application of dyad problem solving techniques in the face of death--

For links into some literature please Google &quot;dyad problem solving&quot;]]></description>

<p>Psychology studies of group cognition find the most effective strategy to be&#8211; instead of form coalitions among themselves and work against outside individuals&#8211; first find out who the smartest player is, everybody else go on coffee break and let the selected player solve the problem by self. </p>
<p>But none of this holds for teams of two players. Why?</p>
<p>Theory of Games predicts it. Because the theorems there tell us that the team of two players lacks the capability to break itself into sub-groups. The death by coalition strategy only works in teams of more than two players.</p>
<p>Nobody knows this in psychology, of course. Nonetheless, their findings about dyad problem solving in the field and in laboratories comprises experimental confirmation of the theorems about dyads found in Theory of Games. Nobody has realized this because the word &#8220;dyad,&#8221; as I remember it, is not found anywhere in the text of Theory of Games.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the core of the strategy behind the $163bn budget of the advertising industry phrased in terms of a joke:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve go too much on my mind to think about anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>Billions of news bytes and meaningless information floods into our brains from advertising and the media content that it supports, with yearly funding in the amount of $163bn.</p>
<p>Distracted from thinking by that amount of media, the populace can think only the most primitive of thoughts. And they are threatened with death. Naturally, there is fear.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a study on the application of dyad problem solving techniques in the face of death&#8211;</p>
