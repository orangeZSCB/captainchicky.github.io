					<description><![CDATA[John,
a couple of things. 

First, you said to download all the files from 1948 to 2013, but in your initial code it looks like you only download files from 1950 to 1979.

Second, i think downloading and installing R is not enough, since it appears that you need to also install the RNetCDF library, otherwise you get an error saying that there is no such package and, understandably, open.nc does not work.

So you might want to insert a line or two explaining how to install that library ...]]></description>

I tested my idea by using the middle grid point of each 3x3 square in the data. So I am using one 2.5 degree pixel compared to using an average over nine. The distances between the centres of the pixels are the same as before, and the number of pixels is the same too.

And I was right, the signal strength goes up, though not by much. I used the 1950-1979 range, starting day 730, and every 100 days, for a total of 103 signal values. In 91 of 103 cases, the &#039;centre pixel&#039; value of the signal was higher.  The mean value of the signal  was about 0.05 higher in the &#039;centre pixel&#039; version.]]></description>

The U. C. Riverside math department website where all my pictures are kept seems to be down tonight---for repairs, I hope.   So, most pictures in most posts here won&#039;t display now.  

Right now it&#039;s 12:47 Monday morning in California, shortly after midnight.  If the pictures still aren&#039;t working when the sun comes up, I&#039;ll contact someone.]]></description>

I think they will go up because of 

(1) what I have been thinking about in the section &#039;Understanding the link strength&#039; in  http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Climate+network. 

(2) thinking that the data from a finer grid will have more day-to-day fluctuations. (I think the spatial smoothing also effectively does some smoothing in time.)

I think the greater day-to-day fluctuations will result in bigger S. But it is very difficult to get an intuition for what their link strength actually measures! It is something like &#039;the extent to which some delay (tau value) gives a higher correlation than other delays&#039;.]]></description>

The code is the final arbiter of details like this. But if it&#039;s doing what I intended, John is right. The first day in the output is day 730, where “day 1″ is 1 January 1948. So the first day in the output is actually the last day of 1949. S(d) uses data from 365+200 days ending in day d.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The definition in that paper you are using is not accurate. They say something to the effect that an ENSO event is when 5 consecutive months exceed thresholds by +- 0.5C.

That&#039;s not the traditional definition. It is when 5 three month averages exceed the thresholds. That&#039;s not the same as five months.

Other definitions do exist, such as conditions forecast in Nino 3.4 to be above thresholds for three months after a three month period has been validated but that&#039;s only if atmospheric anomalies are present.

If you look at the real models output which take into account all parameters (not just the ones here) you will find the slope of trends are down and most forecasters are calling for a weak to moderate event by N. Hemisphere winter.

I am not. My outlook is for a 50% chance for it to remain stable below thresholds for the foreseeable future and no El Niño event occurring. If it does, it will be weak, and the strength of the event is more important than its actual occurrence. ﻿
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I  replied:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Thanks for your helpful comments.

You&#039;re right, Ludescher &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt; are not using the standard definition of El Niño - I don&#039;t know why.  Of course they&#039;re allowed to predict whatever they want to predict.  But in Part 6 of this series we&#039;ll present serious criticisms of their ability to predict what they claim to predict.

Regarding current El Niño predictions, we should note that Ludescher&#039;s paper was published in February and written before that: it&#039;s claiming to do &quot;long-range&quot; El Niño forecasts, so it&#039;s a different thing than the best forecasts we have &lt;i&gt;now&lt;/i&gt; of what&#039;ll happen this fall. 

The National Weather Service came out with new predictions on July 10th:

http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/enso_advisory/ensodisc.html

They claim the chance of El Niño is about 70% during the Northern Hemisphere summer and is close to 80% during the fall and early winter.  They expect it to peak at weak-to-moderate strength during the late fall and early winter (3-month averages of the Niño 3.4 index between 0.5°C and 1.4°C).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>
