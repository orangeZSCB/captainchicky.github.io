					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2014/02/24/markov-models-of-social-change-part-1/#comment-42075&quot;&gt;Paul Mackilligin&lt;/a&gt;.

Ha ha- this map and territory business sounds very similar to a lot of stuff I&#039;ve been reading recently (Eleizer Yudkowsky). I wonder if that is the source, or if that description of the world is older than my current understanding... Anyway

Yes- the model is necessarily a simplification, but I guess there are some simplifications that seem justifiable, and others that don&#039;t... and I guess sometimes it depends on our understanding of the underlying system:
I &quot;understand&quot; particles, thus simplifying to thermodynamics seems acceptable. I don&#039;t &quot;understand&quot; political decision making, therefore I don&#039;t know how best to simplify... although of course even the particles themselves are simplifications of deeper systems which I don&#039;t understand- exist in the map, but possibly not the territory.

But yes- My point is not that I expect models to be 100% accurate, but that this type of model seems hard to test before it is used. Until tests are done we don&#039;t KNOW the models accuracy- having a map but no way to compare it to the territory is a BAD IDEA. 

So... tests probably need to be done somehow (Like I said earlier, small, faster systems seem a good candidate)- it doesn&#039;t mean it WILL work for larger slower systems, but would definitely give me some more faith in the method.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2014/02/24/markov-models-of-social-change-part-1/#comment-37452&quot;&gt;Alastair JL&lt;/a&gt;.

The map and the territory.

Maps are always simplifications of the territory.  If they weren&#039;t simplifications they wouldn&#039;t be maps.  If they weren&#039;t simpler than the territory they would be of little use.

I think we can say the same for models.  A model is essentially a map.

Systems in the real world are complicated and messy.  That&#039;s why we need maps and models.  It&#039;s not possible to model a system in a 100% accurate way unless the system you are modelling is itself a model (or an idealised conception of a real-world situation.)

The degree to which a model is usefully accurate is best determined by running many, many iterations and comparing output against the real world.  But modelling something like climate change or population change does not afford one the opportunity to run many iterations, so the feedback we get from reality is limited.

Also, when models which are intended to model complex systems as closely as possible get so complicated that they are no longer accessible to human intuition, then yes, they potentially are very useful, but there is also a danger of mistaking their precision for accuracy.  Errors can lurk for a long time undiscovered in very complex models.

The value I see in models is not so much that they can output results that are necessarily 100% accurate, but more that they can create shifts in the ways that humans see things.  Human behaviour, including political, economic and social behaviour, is driven by the way that those humans see things, and it is driven by nothing else.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You might be interested to take a look at Cognitive Maps, or System Dynamics approach too. However, the theoretical limit of these approaches is when you are defining those descriptors or features of the real phenomena. If we define complexity as a function of number of descriptors, then these approaches regardless of the original ideas, become arbitrary as you cannot validate the descriptors, except those cases that you use this method for communication and cross-learning. This underlying problem is &quot;the curse of dimensionality&quot;.

However, I am fan of Markov, and if you refer to his original idea in linguistics, he doesn&#039;t have this dimensionality problem. In my opinion, Markov was aware of this problem and what he proposes is not a method for inference, but a method for &quot;encapsulation of all the potential descriptors&quot; in &quot;symbolic relations.&quot;]]></description>

It took me a second to be sure you meant: it certainly seems to be the case that we &lt;i&gt;shouldn&#039;t&lt;/i&gt; regard these &#039;time steps&#039; as actual steps of time in the real world.

Okay, we agree.

Actually this model you wrote down is a deterministic differential equation, not a Markov chain describing the evolution of probabilities with time.  

But anyway, I&#039;m not interested in this model right now; I&#039;m interested in the setup that Vanessa Schweizer and Alastair Jamieson-Lane described in their blog posts.  And I think most of us agree that their  setup does not describe how quantities change with time.  It describes relationships between probabilities at a &lt;i&gt;fixed&lt;/i&gt; time.

My question remains: precisely what sort of relationship between probabilities does it describe?   The equation is simple enough:

$latex p_i = \sum_j a_{ij} p_j $

But the meaning of this equation, and how you get experts to provide estimates of the quantities $latex a_{ij},$ is less clear.]]></description>

I am thinking that if

and the expert give the parameters of the model, then the evolution can be estimated.
For infinitesimal time the differential equation evolution becomes a Markov chain with some parameters constraint (to preserve the normalization), and the transition matrix is almost diagonal:
$latex Population(t+\epsilon) = Population(t)+ A\epsilon Income(t)+B\epsilon Education(t) $
$latex p_i = p_j (\delta_{ji}+\epsilon_{ji}) $
So that each almost diagonal Markov chain is an approximation of a differential equation.]]></description>

John wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;This is our equilibrium probability distribution. But I don’t exactly know what this equation is supposed to mean!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If one would start out with a probability distribution then I could imagine that one could start with a &quot;bold assumption&quot; like that event 1 occurs with certainty and all other events do not occur and then finding an equilibrium means that one finds a distribution which is compatible with the given conditional probabilities in the matrix.

The following text (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lampsacus.com/documents/CROSSIMPACT.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;page 4&lt;/a&gt;) sounds a bit in that direction apart from the fact that instead of probability 1 one takes a number between $0$ and $1$, if I understand correctly:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Once the event set is determined, the next step is to estimate the initial probability of each event.
These probabilities indicate the likelihood that each event will occur by some future year. In the initial application of cross impact and in some current applications, the probability of each event is specified, assuming that the other events have not occurred. Thus, the probability of each event is judged in isolation and the cross-impact analysis is used to adjust the initial probabilities for the
influences of the other events.&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

Thus, the probability of each event is judged in isolation and the cross-impact analysis is used to adjust the initial probabilities for the<br />
influences of the other events.</p>

Most importantly, the experts are &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; being asked &quot;how will the present value of one variable affect another variable next year?&quot; (or some other time step).  They&#039;re being asked &quot;how does the present value of one variable directly affect another variable &lt;i&gt;now&lt;/i&gt;?&quot;  

So, as I&#039;ve argued before, we should not think of the variable n as &#039;time&#039;, but rather, as a more abstract &#039;relaxation parameter&#039;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
more abstractly as the process of any given scenario smearing out to the most self-consistent probability distribution of scenarios.

(The statistical mechanics jargon for this kind of “smearing out” is “relaxation”, which leads to some interesting titles involving phrases like violent relaxation.)

It seems that given how you’re generating the transition probabilities in the Markov chain, the latter more abstract interpretation is better. The questions that evoked these probabilities didn’t ask about processes in time, and any unit of time per step—years, decades?—would thus be “made up” by the researcher rather than elicited by the questions. This sounds bad.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But this doesn&#039;t fully answer the question of what the parameter n really means---nor what the transition probabilities in the Markov chain mean!  The problem is, it&#039;s not completely clear (to me) what it means to ask &quot;how does the present value of one variable directly affect another variable &lt;i&gt;at the same time&lt;/i&gt;?&quot;   ]]></description>

I thought that the theory could be simple:
$latex Population(n+1)-Population(n)=A Income(n)+ B Education(n) $
so that the Target variations (and not the target) are caused from the Influences.
The parameters could be an expert estimates, and the Vanessa Schweizer matrixes represent (with different colors) somethings like the graphical representation of a partial derivatives values (it can be a method to condense in a graph the Markov chain, or each numerical graph).
In such way a numerical trend is possible: if there is a great partial derivative then the economist, or metereologist, can try to modify these variables.]]></description>
