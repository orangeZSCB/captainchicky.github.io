Thanks Todd. By putting together the nLab article on cartesian bicategories, and your comments here, I obtained an great overview of the situation. Painlessly, that&#039;s a bonus :)]]></description>

Just to get some easy stuff out of the way: yes, a locally posetal bicategory is the same thing as a Pos-enriched category. Generally, the composition of 1-cells in a bicategory is associative up to coherent isomorphism, but since isomorphisms in posets are identities (by antisymmetry), one has strictly associative composition of 1-cells, so a locally posetal bicategory is a locally posetal 2-category is a Pos-enriched category. I should also mention that the general definition of cartesian bicategory is meant to encompass non-(locally posetal) examples like Span and Prof (the bicategory of categories, profunctors, and natural transformations between them), but for Rel-like examples the Carboni-Walters definition is probably easier to follow. There&#039;s another way to present the general definition, due I think to Carboni, Kelly, Verity, and Wood. 

Yes, good point about the monoidal products: the definition of cartesian bicategory just mentions one (corresponding to &quot;and&quot;). I&#039;ve not thought about two! That would be worth considering. The compactness condition for cartesian bicategories most naturally arises through something called the Frobenius law (more on this at the nLab article on bicategory of relations), but there are notable examples like Prof which do not obey this law, and perhaps one should think about possible interpretations of your set-up in such examples. (I mean, Prof *is* compact as a monoidal bicategory, but the dual of an object is not equivalent to the same object as it is in Rel, or really any cartesian bicategory obeying the Frobenius law. Objects in Prof being categories, the compact dual of a category is the opposite category.) 

I&#039;d not paid too much attention to MIX in the past, but your paper gives me some motivation to revisit this axiom. :-)]]></description>

John, I&#039;m looking forward to this. Actually, I never intended to bother you with logic, but with diagrams: the diagrams (&quot;nets&quot; or &quot;circuits&quot;) Todd, Cockett, and Seely introduced, and which later turned out to have to do a lot with logic, and, I suspect, with the diagram work you and some of your students do. 

PS: In previous comments I had a typo in my email, which I now corrected.]]></description>

Todd, I had a first glance at cartesian bicategories, as presented in your nLab article and in the original paper by Carboni and Walters. I once got within an inches length to that paper - but didn&#039;t read it. So thanks! It does indeed look as if &quot;cut-elimination-models&quot; I mentioned are closely related to posetal cartesian bicategories. The catch seems to be that the latter are logically degenerate in that they have only one monoidal product (am I right?), which models both &quot;and&quot; and &quot;or&quot;, in other words, they are compact. What irked me about my own work was that I never managed to give *nice* non-compact models. (Contrived non-compact models can be obtained by taking a product of a compact model and and a distributive/boolean lattice, but that&#039;s unsatisfactory.) The non-posetal bicartesian categories you descibe in the nLab could be an interesting way towards a finer-grained analysis of cut elimination. On the other hand, the partial order I used is not extra data, but derived with the help of a natural transformation called &quot;MIX&quot;. So it remains to be explored what this bodes for a move towards non-posetal 2-cells.   

Finally, I have a stupid question: am I right in assuming that a locally posetal bicategory is the same thing as a poset-enriched category?]]></description>

Carsten, I&#039;ve had a little more time now to look at your paper. It seems a key example of a bicategory to keep in mind here is Rel (the bicategory of sets and relations), where the inequality from the redex to the reduct in Lafont-type examples should be compared to the ever-present lax morphisms between commutative comonoids considered by Carboni and Walters in their work on cartesian bicategories. Anyway, it&#039;s a nice paper; thanks very much for bringing it to attention!]]></description>

Carsten: when I get back to Erlangen I&#039;d love you to show me what you know about a treatment of proofs in classical logic using bicategories.  Maybe after you tell me the other things you were planning to tell me about!]]></description>

Thanks for pointing me to the nForum/nLab! I must say to my chagrin that I hadn&#039;t been aware of it. Because of my current occupation as a software engineer, my scientific endeavours are &quot;only&quot; recreational, and very moderate. Still, it will be great to keep an eye on this.]]></description>

Carsten, thank you very much for pointing to this!  I&#039;ve begun to take a look (but don&#039;t have any response yet). We were actually discussing GoI at the &lt;a href=&quot;nforum.mathforge.org/discussion/5608/geometry-of-interaction/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;nForum&lt;/a&gt; recently, and it would be great to have your insights there as well.]]></description>
