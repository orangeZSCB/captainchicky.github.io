					<description><![CDATA[Finally, humiliated and defeated, I gave up. I think it was October 2004.

This was the worst feeling: nearly a whole year gone with absolutely nothing to show for it. Worse, I was wracked with guilt, feeling I’d totally wasted Nick’s time.

…

Things soon got better. By a miracle my postdoc had been extended for a while, so at least I wasn’t on the job market straight away. Secondly, at the end of 2004 I went to a truly inspiring conference at the Isaac Newton institute where I met up with Guifre Vidal who showed me something amazing: the Multiscale Entanglement Renormalisation Ansatz, and I realised that what I should do is focus on more my core skill set (quantum entanglement and many body quantum spin systems). I began working on tensor networks, read a fantastic paper of Hastings, and got into the Lieb--Robinson game.

If I had my time again what would I do differently? I don’t regret working on this problem. It was worth a try. My mistake was to keep working on it, to the exclusion of everything else, for too long. These days I am mindful of the advice of Wheeler: you should never do a calculation until you already know the answer. I also try to keep a portfolio of problems on the go, some risky ones, and some safe ones. (More on that in a future post.) Finally, upon reflection, I think my motivation for working on this problem was totally wrong. I was primarily interested in solving a famous problem and becoming famous rather than the problem itself. In the past decade I’ve learnt to be very critical of this kind of motivation, as I’ve seldom found it successful.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I’ve been interested for some time in the problem of constructing a Friendly Artificial Intelligence---a general artifical intelligence that shares human values, instead of just killing us all or whatever. There’s this organization called MIRI which is doing research on this problem, and their director, Luke Muelhauser, recently interviewed John Baez. And in the comments of the interview on Baez’s blog, Baez started talking about Homotopy Type Theory, and Univalent Foundations! Anyway, may daydream is that maybe thinking about some of the problems (the Tiling Agents problem is the one I have in mind, specifically) from a HoTT perspective might yield some interesting insights. But that is still very far away, and just a dream for now…]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2014/02/18/finding-and-solving-problems/#comment-36872&quot;&gt;Eugene Lerman&lt;/a&gt;.

I believe in your work you want to label the vertices with phase spaces.  That&#039;s an example of what I&#039;m talking about.  And I guess it&#039;s a good sign of the bicategorical structure that we&#039;re labelling the vertices with objects in a category, rather than elements of a set!

In the signal flow diagrams of control theory, as explained &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks_oxford/networks_control.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;in my talk&lt;/a&gt;, the edges are labelled with spaces, while the vertices are labelled by relations from a product of spaces to another product of spaces.   However, in the version of the theory I describe here, all these spaces are &lt;i&gt;the same!&lt;/i&gt;   They&#039;re all the same space of &#039;signals&#039;, a vector space $latex V$  over the field of rational functions $\mathbb{R}(s).$ where $latex s$ acts as $latex d/dt.$    So, the labelling of edges is invisible in this example.  It becomes visible in more general kinds of signal flow diagrams where we have different types of signal.  

(And again, it&#039;s a good sign that &#039;type&#039; here is being used the way they do in computer science, meaning an object in a category.) 

I believe the spaces I&#039;ve just been talking about should be viewed as configuration spaces rather than phases spaces.  As you&#039;ll see near the end of  &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks_oxford/networks_control.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;that talk&lt;/a&gt;, when we get signal flow diagrams from electrical circuit diagrams the signals come in pairs: the voltage and current along a wire.  These pairs should be thought of as lying in $latex V \times V^*,$ and the symplectic structure on $latex V \times V^*$ become important.

Thanks for prodding me: I had to have some new ideas to make up this explanation, and I&#039;ll have to do more work to flesh it out!  But the simple point is: if you want a network that &quot;has phase spaces&quot;, you&#039;re going to take a graph and label its edges and/or vertices with phase spaces.]]></description>

One thing that is bugging me is that physical systems have states and observables, so networks of physical systems should have phase spaces.  And I don&#039;t  really see these phase spaces when a network is a &quot;graph with labelled vertices and/or edges, thought of as a morphism in a bicategory”.  Could you comment/clarify/elaborate?]]></description>

From &quot;There Goes Rhymin&#039; Simon&quot; -- fantastic album which I haven&#039;t heard in decades. I didn&#039;t remember the song was about apartment life; all I could remember were the tinkling piano triplets until I just looked it up on Youtube.]]></description>

Definitely!  Of course this is how I study objects in &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; category: by looking at the morphisms in and out of it.  To me the extra cool thing about networks is that they&#039;re also morphisms, so we can compose them.  (When you&#039;ve got a 1-morphism in a bicategory, it&#039;s a morphism from the point of view of the objects, but an object from the point of view of the 2-morphisms.  As Paul Simon said about life in a New York apartment, &quot;one man&#039;s ceiling is another man&#039;s floor.)]]></description>

I agree to agree with you :).

We can also study the behavior of a large network by looking at the maps into it from other networks and maps out of it to other networks.  I think you would agree with that.]]></description>
