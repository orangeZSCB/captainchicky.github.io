The 2-arrows in the Wehrheim-Woodward 2-category are a bit complicated and  not easy to guess unless you are fluent in symplectic topology.  It is mentioned in the original paper of Wehrheim-Woodward (http://arxiv.org/pdf/0708.2851v3.pdf).  The point is that there are morphisms between pairs of Lagrangian manifolds, the idea that goes back to Donaldson and Fukaya. Wehrheim-Woodward use psedoholomorphic quilts (basically moduli of pseudo-holomorphic strips, but I am mangling it).]]></description>

The monoidal category of finite-dimensional vector spaces and linear relations is compact closed when we use direct sum as our tensor product, so it &lt;i&gt;has&lt;/i&gt; a cap and cup whether we want them or not.  These allow us to describe, not just feedback, but arbitrary physical systems involving linear signal processing and wires that bend up and down.  Compact closed monoidal categories are traced, but it would be a shame to focus solely on the lesser structure when you actually have more.]]></description>

HI John,

Very interesting remarks of Alan W&#039;s - it reminds me somewhat of Pronk&#039;s construction of the bicategory of fractions (Composito Math. 1996), in particular of Gpd(S), the 2-category of groupoids in S. One can rigidify this construction to anafunctors (me, in TAC 2012) if some supplementary data (a pretopology on S) satisfies a condition (is subcanonical). However in general one must play with the extra freedom that something analogous to Weinstein&#039;s Q --&#062; X \times \bar Y. However, this is not a tight enough analogy for me to guess what 2-morphisms might be.]]></description>

Why do we &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; cap and cup?  Can&#039;t traced monoidal categories -- where &quot;trace&quot; simply maps morphisms of the form (X (x) U) -&#062; (Y (x) U) to morphisms X -&#062; Y (the U output has been fed back into the input) -- give us the appropriate notion?  This seems to map more comfortably to the way that system theorists tend to view &quot;feedback&quot; as a sort of primitive operation/notion.]]></description>

Thanks for helping me identify a point where my formalization has something new to offer.  

I claim you really need caps and cups to implement general feedback loops.  The feedback loop in slide 21 may not &lt;i&gt;look&lt;/i&gt; like it has caps, cups and relations, but it does---or more precisely, we need to think of it this way to get a reasonably efficient and elegant mathematical treatment.  We also need relations to handle linear electrical circuits in a reasonably nice way.   

Control theorists and electrical engineers may not believe this, but that just means I have something to teach them (which is good).  Please wait for further talks and/or papers, where I&#039;ll try to explain this in a convincing way!]]></description>

I think that if you work wit maps (which might not be invertible) then you have an implicit natural directionality in the blocks, so you have to label inputs and outputs differently and this leads to the fact that arrows have a direction as well.

This is the most common convention in control theory and practice (and by the way this is &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/04/03/network-theory-part-3/#comment-5184&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;an example&lt;/a&gt;).

But you are working with both relations and maps, and I see how cup and caps might be useful in situations where you want to &lt;a href=&quot;http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~jwillems/Articles/JournalArticles/2007.1.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;share&lt;/a&gt; variables, for example. 

I just don&#039;t see the feedback loop as an example in which you &lt;i&gt;absolutely have&lt;/i&gt; to use them, because to me the feedback loop is not qualitatively different from the graph in slide 21 (where cups and caps are not used).

But alright, ok, i will wait until you write something else and draw your own pictures, i promise :-)]]></description>

Perhaps this will help.  There are various ways one can try to keep track of &#039;directionality of signal flow&#039; for diagrams made of boxes connected by wires, where wires touch the boxes at specific points---let me call those &#039;ports&#039;.

One is to draw arrows on the wires connecting boxes, but not label the ports on boxes.  This works if every box allows one input and one output and we impose a rule saying each box must be connected to one wire with an arrow pointing in and one wire with an arrow pointing out, as here:

&lt;img width=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Feedback_loop_with_descriptions.svg/500px-Feedback_loop_with_descriptions.svg.png&quot;/&gt;

However, this approach becomes problematic as soon as we have boxes with more than two ports.  

Another approach is to not draw arrows on wires, but instead have boxes with labelled ports.  For example, a box could have two ports labelled &#039;input&#039; and &#039;output&#039;.  Or, it could have five ports labelled &#039;A&#039;, &#039;B&#039;, &#039;C&#039;, &#039;D&#039; and &#039;E&#039;.  In this setup, every diagram made of boxes and wires where every port has a wire coming in gives a device that makes sense.

This latter approach is the one that naturally arises in the mathematics of relations, and it&#039;s the one I want to use.

However, while having this conversation I noticed that the symbol for scalar multiplication in &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/control/control_talk_erlangen.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;my talk slides&lt;/a&gt; doesn&#039;t obey the rules I just laid down: when you&#039;ve got a circle-shaped box with two wires coming in, you can&#039;t really tell which end of the circle is the input port and which is the output port.   I&#039;d been reading the from top to bottom, but we won&#039;t always want this.  So, I think we need to fix this.]]></description>

Professor Baez, there is also a diagramming tool I once used to model manufacturing processes called Petri nets, which are closely related to those you are studying called stochastic Petri nets. 

However, here is a word to the wise-- Don&#039;t propose to develop a commercial tool for modeling the capital budgeting process in customer companies by prototyping and iterating in your own company, no matter how much the tool might ground the sale of certain products to customers based upon objective data. Recall what the economist Erik Brynjolfsson of MIT has described in his papers about &quot;HIPPO&quot; management (management by the &quot;HIghest Paid Person&#039;s in the room Opinion&quot;). This is a management practice he contrasts with management decision-making based upon objective data. Threats to management have in many cases proven to be lethal to career(s)!

Come to think of it, such a tool might be a good way to regulate companies on their decisions related to climate change. Though with the above lesson in-mind, it might be better to approach an organization like the NSA about this-- especially when it starts becoming obvious to everybody that climate change is a threat to national security. 

(-:    CORPORATE AMERICA PLEASE, KINDLY, NOTE: 
THE LAST TWO PARAGRAPHS ARE A JOKE!!!!    :-)

Ok, so the “reverse sensor” map comes out with an _input_ on the left hand side, which explains why you say you use a cap to force the input of the reverse sensor (that is the output of the original sensor) to be equal to one of the inputs of the addition at the beginning. is that right?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yeah, sorta.  But it sounds very complicated and surreal. I&#039;m really just talking about the usual math of relations, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relation_%28mathematics%29#Operations_on_binary_relations&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;operations on relations&lt;/a&gt;.  Since the purely mathematical treatment in my slides didn&#039;t seem to be communicating the ideas clearly, I started talking to you using something that vaguely resembles plain English.  Now I&#039;m starting to regret that, because the &#039;plain English&#039; is getting very convoluted.  

&#039;The input of the reversed sensor is the output of the sensor&#039; sounds very scary.  All it really &lt;i&gt;means&lt;/i&gt; is this: if have a box where you plug in an input wire on the left and the output comes out a wire on the right, and you turn around the box, now you have to plug the input wire on the right and the output comes out the left!  

The turned-around box can be seen as a new device, a &#039;reversed sensor&#039; whose input is the output of the old device, and vice versa.  But this makes a simple business seem rather mysterious.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I am more used to think that the only important directionality is the one of the arrow, because it carries the signal in that direction, and that it does not matter how it is oriented on the page, or if it bends or zig zags around, but perhaps it’s not so in this formalism.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If you look at my slides you&#039;ll see there are no arrows.  So, the picture I borrowed because I was too lazy to draw my own is confusing you in yet another way: it has arrows.

I think the best thing to do at this point is wait until I write something else about this formalism, and continue the conversation then.  It&#039;ll have pictures---and they won&#039;t be confusing pictures drawn by someone else in a different style than the one I&#039;m using---so it will make a lot more sense than the conversation we&#039;re having now.   This conversation has been very instructive to me, because it reminds me that there are several different ways to think about these things, which become very confusing when mixed with each other.]]></description>

<p>Yeah, sorta.  But it sounds very complicated and surreal. I&#8217;m really just talking about the usual math of relations, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relation_%28mathematics%29#Operations_on_binary_relations" rel="nofollow">operations on relations</a>.  Since the purely mathematical treatment in my slides didn&#8217;t seem to be communicating the ideas clearly, I started talking to you using something that vaguely resembles plain English.  Now I&#8217;m starting to regret that, because the &#8216;plain English&#8217; is getting very convoluted.  </p>
<p>&#8216;The input of the reversed sensor is the output of the sensor&#8217; sounds very scary.  All it really <i>means</i> is this: if have a box where you plug in an input wire on the left and the output comes out a wire on the right, and you turn around the box, now you have to plug the input wire on the right and the output comes out the left!  </p>
<p>The turned-around box can be seen as a new device, a &#8216;reversed sensor&#8217; whose input is the output of the old device, and vice versa.  But this makes a simple business seem rather mysterious.</p>

<p>If you look at my slides you&#8217;ll see there are no arrows.  So, the picture I borrowed because I was too lazy to draw my own is confusing you in yet another way: it has arrows.</p>
<p>I think the best thing to do at this point is wait until I write something else about this formalism, and continue the conversation then.  It&#8217;ll have pictures&#8212;and they won&#8217;t be confusing pictures drawn by someone else in a different style than the one I&#8217;m using&#8212;so it will make a lot more sense than the conversation we&#8217;re having now.   This conversation has been very instructive to me, because it reminds me that there are several different ways to think about these things, which become very confusing when mixed with each other.</p>

Ok, so the &quot;reverse sensor&quot; map comes out with an _input_ on the left hand side, which explains why you say you use a cap to force the input of the reverse sensor (that is the output of the original sensor) to be equal to one of the inputs of the addition at the beginning. is that right ?

It still feels very weird that in this formalism you can&#039;t just directly connect the output to the duplicator to the input of the sensor (the way you connect for example the output of the addition to the controller input that follows it).

Perhaps you do all this because you want to preserve some kind of directionality from left to right for ALL the gadgets ? 

I am more used to think that the only important directionality is the one of the arrow, because it carries the signal in that direction, and that it does not matter how it is oriented on the page, or if it bends or zig zags around, but perhaps it&#039;s not so in this formalism.]]></description>
