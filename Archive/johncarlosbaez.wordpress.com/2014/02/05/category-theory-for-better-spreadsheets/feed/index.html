&quot;But there is probably a whole branch of computer science explicitly devoted to creating languages and software that make it harder to make dumb mistakes while still keeping it easy to do what you want. If there’s not, there should be.&quot;

There is certainly a huge amount of research into topics such as types and type-checking. The work that Robert Smart mentions below on monads and IO is one example. But sadly, I don&#039;t think this separate branch of computer science exists yet.

As an example, take my Excelsior programming language. I wanted it to be type-checked. We know that compile-time type-checking avoids mistakes. So far so good. 

But then I had to choose a notation for my types and type statements. This is where computer science intersects with psychology. Some notations, one presumes, are easier for humans to read or write than others. Depending probably on the reader or author&#039;s previous experience. But is there a &quot;Handbook of Optimum Notation&quot; for me to look up the optimum design of type statements in? No! (*). 

And similarly for the other constructs in my language. When it comes to designing notation, I&#039;m not sure that we&#039;ve advanced much beyond &lt;a href=&quot;http://introtologic.info/AboutLogicsite/whitehead%20Good%20Notation.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Alfred North Whitehead&#039;s famous remark&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;blockquote&gt;It is a profoundly erroneous truism, repeated by all copy-books and by eminent people when they are making speeches, that we should cultivate the habit of thinking of what we are doing. The precise opposite is the case. Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can  perform without thinking about them. Operations of thought are like cavalry charges in a battle they are strictly limited in number, they require fresh horses, and must only be made at decisive moments. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

(*) Granted, this is a very subtle matter. Perhaps hard-to-read type statements are easier to remember! That&#039;s only a guess, which I make by analogy with theresearch reported here: &lt;a&gt;Hard-to-Read Fonts Promote Better Recall&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>

My first comment was a bit skeptical, I wanted to object against the idea of preventing all errors, which I think we agree is not possible. But do I agree there must be good ways of making less mistakes.

I use Excel a lot, the main reason being that most people I work with also know how to use it, making it easy to share things. Reusing the same software is perhaps the most effective way of eliminating mistakes.
Above a certain complexity in the calculations, I switch to VBA.

I will read your articles. With many millions of users, we should not underestimate the impact of this software on society.

Well if every sufficiently interesting computer activity can be regarded as programming, and if the type of a value is everything that the compiler can know about that value, then maybe type checking is the way to find all dumb mistakes. It is perhaps worth noting that the experts only recently worked out how to handle IO in a mathematically nice programming language. This used monads and has opened the flood gates to applying category theory to programming. However I think existing programming languages have trouble with the common situation where one type is a special case of another, and most particularly with the common case where we want to say &quot;and these types fit in between those 2 types, but in different ways&quot;.]]></description>

Hi Jocelyn,

here we go. The &quot;re-foundation&quot; of economics is a bit too large of a word but I think some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vikwin.de/drupal/people&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;interested researchers&lt;/a&gt; and me are working at one of the core characteristics of social systems namely that the model interacts with the modelled system, the society, or that modelling takes place in the modelled system. This happens also in the small in personal situations like in &quot;I know that you know that I know and so on&quot; or in self-fulfilling prophecies. 

We call the attempt to model these issues reflexive economics. The basic structures that need to be considered are those to get along with the circularities involved. One handy structure are coalgebras that may represent infinite data types, as a computer scientists would call it. Another is the reflexivity that is inherent in lambda calculus where terms can be the operator, what is operated on and the result of an operation. The same meta level structure is inherent in the notion of a universal Turing machine that may simulate and operate on any other Turing machine. 

I guess the two basic underlying advantages to use categories is that properties can be defined by embedding, i.e. self-participating universals and that categories are &quot;fractal&quot; in that morphisms can be again objects in other categories. It opens the path to think about a related question of reflexivity that arises in social systems, namely how do these structures that mutually contain each other compose into hole systems, where again as a &quot;vertical&quot; reflexivity subparts think about or model the hole and the hole influences or constrains the subparts.

The &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflexivity_(social_theory)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reflexive concerns are known in social sciences&lt;/a&gt; since long to be at the core of many most important issues if not being the defining feature of social science but it is not clear how to approach that mathematically, and this is what we try to explore. However, we are really at the very beginning of finding a proper mathematical form.

Jocelyn, it&#039;s a small world in that John and me are co-organizing a Dagstuhl &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=14182&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;workshop&lt;/a&gt; where this issue of reflexivity will be one topic. There is another one only on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=15042&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;coalgebras in reflexive economics&lt;/a&gt;.

Dusko Pavlovic and I are working on a basic framework for reflexivity in social systems (using game theory, the universality of Turing machines, coalgebras and Kleene&#039;s recursion theorem) in his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.asecolab.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;asecolab&lt;/a&gt; on cyber attacks. There are a few (preliminary) papers on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vikwin.de/drupal/work&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; that is something of a beginning of mathematical reflexive economics.

					<description><![CDATA[John, thanks for the intro! Yes, my work is concerned with making spreadsheets easier to read and safer to program. I suspect there aren&#039;t any climate models coded in Excel (*), so I probably don&#039;t have much to do with that particular aspect of saving the planet. 

But there certainly are financial and economic models, and the Reinhart-Rogoff business suggests how influential these can be.  Imagine for example an economic model, misprogrammed in Excel, that tells politicians they need to save money by making massive cuts in environmental protection (**). Or a misprogrammed geological spreadsheet that tells frackers they can safely solve our oil needs by tearing up the East Midlands.

My work&#039;s connection with category theory came about via &lt;a href=&quot;http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Joseph+Goguen&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Joseph Goguen&lt;/a&gt;&#039;s work on algebraic semantics and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~goguen/sys/obj.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;OBJ family of programming languages&lt;/a&gt;, and on &lt;a href=&quot;http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/sheaf+semantics+of+concurrent+interacting+objects&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;a categorical description of interacting objects&lt;/a&gt;. In a paper &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.j-paine.org/calco2011/paper.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Module Expressions for Modularising Spreadsheets and Sharing Code between Them&lt;/a&gt;, I&#039;ve explained the relation between spreadsheets and the way the OBJ languages treat modules. Warning: the paper is terse, because of the page limits for the conference concerned, so may not be all that pleasant to read. There&#039;s a description of a graphical interface for modules in a blog posting I wrote for Doctor Dobbs, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.j-paine.org/dobbs/spreadlets.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Spreadsheet Components, Google Spreadsheets, and Code Reuse&lt;/a&gt;.

Categories aren&#039;t the only influence on my work. I&#039;ve designed a programming language that maps on to spreadsheets in a very simple fashion, but that is easier to read because it uses named variables rather than A1-style cell names. (It also has compile-time type-checking). The module system mentioned above fits very nicely into this. For a simple example of the language, see my blog posting &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.make-spreadsheets-safe.co.uk/2014/01/kaprekars-constant-in-excel-and.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Kaprekar&#039;s Constant in Excel and Excelsior&lt;/a&gt;. This shows how I coded a spreadsheet that calculates one of the most useless integers ever, .6174.

I&#039;ve also experimented with tools that make it easier to understand existing spreadsheets by reverse-engineering them into this language.  There&#039;s a short explanation at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.j-paine.org/dobbs/structure_discovery.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How to Reveal Implicit Structure in Spreadsheets&lt;/a&gt;.

Of course, even with better tools, people will still make errors. Peter Haggstrom comments above on a quant whose Excel pricing model got correlation coefficients outside the interval [-1,1]. That could have happened in any language, and the remedies include proper testing, proper documentation, and making sure that you have the right staff, i.e. decent statisticians!

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>John, thanks for the intro! Yes, my work is concerned with making spreadsheets easier to read and safer to program. I suspect there aren&#8217;t any climate models coded in Excel (*), so I probably don&#8217;t have much to do with that particular aspect of saving the planet. </p>
<p>But there certainly are financial and economic models, and the Reinhart-Rogoff business suggests how influential these can be.  Imagine for example an economic model, misprogrammed in Excel, that tells politicians they need to save money by making massive cuts in environmental protection (**). Or a misprogrammed geological spreadsheet that tells frackers they can safely solve our oil needs by tearing up the East Midlands.</p>
<p>My work&#8217;s connection with category theory came about via <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Joseph+Goguen" rel="nofollow">Joseph Goguen</a>&#8216;s work on algebraic semantics and the <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~goguen/sys/obj.html" rel="nofollow">OBJ family of programming languages</a>, and on <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/sheaf+semantics+of+concurrent+interacting+objects" rel="nofollow">a categorical description of interacting objects</a>. In a paper <a href="http://www.j-paine.org/calco2011/paper.html" rel="nofollow">Module Expressions for Modularising Spreadsheets and Sharing Code between Them</a>, I&#8217;ve explained the relation between spreadsheets and the way the OBJ languages treat modules. Warning: the paper is terse, because of the page limits for the conference concerned, so may not be all that pleasant to read. There&#8217;s a description of a graphical interface for modules in a blog posting I wrote for Doctor Dobbs, <a href="http://www.j-paine.org/dobbs/spreadlets.html" rel="nofollow">Spreadsheet Components, Google Spreadsheets, and Code Reuse</a>.</p>
<p>Categories aren&#8217;t the only influence on my work.
