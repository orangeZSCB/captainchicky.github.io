					<description><![CDATA[I am thinking, reading your notes, that the objects can be words in the natural language, and the function the binary operations of the boolean logic; is each theorem a categorical reasoning?
If I understand well, if there are two structures with a bijective function between categorical objects, then the spaces of the words can have space of the objects with the same properties.
I am thinking that the biological words can be the proteins, so that could be a bijection between some subspace of the words that have a representation in the proteins (hot, cold, bright, smell, nuiscance) with some subspace of the logical reasonings.]]></description>
