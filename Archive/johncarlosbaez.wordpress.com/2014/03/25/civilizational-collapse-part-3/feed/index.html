					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2014/03/25/civilizational-collapse-part-3/#comment-39359&quot;&gt;domenico&lt;/a&gt;.

Domenico- &quot;I see that in each civilization exist always more of two classes, Politburo and people, National People’s congress and people, with hereditaries positions&quot;

One hallmark of every developed system, at least in Europe and Asia, has been the development of a middle class- the storekeepers, traders, bankers, and industry- everybody outside of the farmers or perhaps peasants.  Without a middle class, and in more developed societies even more in-between classes, society cannot function efficiently.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2014/03/25/civilizational-collapse-part-3/#comment-39293&quot;&gt;gamanrad&lt;/a&gt;.

While it is an interesting exercise this reminds much of ecological models such as hare and bobcats or ticks, deer and oak trees.  A small set of equations, assumptions, and parameters can make interesting graphs, some of which might be useful.

While in the past some societies may have collapsed due to resource depletion, resources are actually what we make them to be, based on utility(Easter Island), cost, and substitution.  There is plenty of flint available to make arrowheads for hunting now.  There didn&#039;t used to be.  Good flint was traded, at great cost, far and wide across the Americas.  As better ways to hunt for food and wage wars the need for flint rapidly disappeared.

However, most of the examples mentioned seemed to be caused by natural disasters such as extended droughts or climate change. The fall of Rome, the movements of the Barbarians appear to be caused by the cooling of the climate after the Roman climate optimum.  The several civilizations in Central America appear to fall mainly to drought.  Despite large scale public works, most of the populations lived within one bad harvest of starvation.  A bad harvest or outbreak of disease could completely disrupt the culture. In most cases they could or would not adapt to such external changes.  Part of the reason the Vikings left Greenland, despite the fact that the Inuit were living there pretty successfully, was that the Viking culture refused to adopt Inuit ways and those who could went back to Europe.

Birth rates are not fixed.  Birth rate depends on the cost of energy.  When energy is expensive(all work done manually) the birth rate is high both among elites and commoners due to the need for many hands for work and the high death rate of infants and children and adults.  As the cost of energy comes down increased wealth causes a drastic drop in birth rate.

The article does not define wealth.  Wealth is the accumulated surplus production.  It may include public works(roads, plumbing, buildings, etc), hoards of precious metals or gems, savings(whether in money or goods) etc.  An efficient society manages the wealth through supply and demand, producing what is needed when and where it is needed, with the primary profits going to the producers.  The more concentrated and centrally controlled the wealth is the less efficiency there is and the less adaptable the society is to upsets whether from climate change or wars or disease.]]></description>

Thanks for the hint---I should learn more about World3.

HANDY is a very simple model which leaves out many of the key aspects of our current situation, so it wouldn&#039;t be hard for World3 to be a better guide to the problems facing us now.]]></description>
