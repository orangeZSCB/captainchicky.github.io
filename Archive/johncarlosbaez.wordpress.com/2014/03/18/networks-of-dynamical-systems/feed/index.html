					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m way late to this party, but thank you to Professor Lerman for writing this! I&#039;ve been trying to work my way through the iterations of this paper in detail for several years now and the overview is a great help.

A couple of points worth making from the applied side (if anyone actually returns to the thread!):

First, Stewart showed - and I hope I&#039;m translating this correctly into the Boldi/Vigna terminology - that the epimorphic fibrations of a given graph form a complete lattice. Since this lattice is isomorphic to a lattice of synchrony subspaces for the system, it makes sense to consider the subspace complements as well: these are spaces e.g. $latex x+y+z=0$ that I&#039;m calling &#039;cosynchrony subspaces&#039;. It&#039;s unclear to me whether there&#039;s a connection to graph morphisms (cofibrations?) for this dual lattice.

Second, exponential synchronization (see e.g. Pham&#039;s and Slotine&#039;s work) is just the contraction of a corresponding cosynchrony subspace, so we can also consider contraction of synchrony spaces themselves (&#039;cosynchronization&#039;). In both cases, we can assert stability of the subspace through simple operations on the dynamical system&#039;s Jacobian matrix.

In other words, for an explicit but freely parametrized system, e.g. a network of model neurons with unknown connection weights, we can 1) find interesting subspaces combinatorially, via graph fibrations and subspace complementarity 2) find parametric conditions that guarantee dynamical convergence onto one or another of those subspaces.

Finally, I believe H. Ruan has been working on the question of &quot;what happens when we add more things to an existing network&quot; and also has a much more detailed picture of network structure&#039;s influence on things like phase-locking.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2014/03/18/networks-of-dynamical-systems/#comment-38970&quot;&gt;John Baez&lt;/a&gt;.

It would take more explanation for me to see precisely what problem you&#039;re worrying about.  When I take the product of two compact manifolds

$latex M = M_1 \times M_2$

I take the tensor product of their commutative algebra of smooth functions

$latex C^\infty(M) \cong C^\infty(M_1) \otimes C^\infty(M_2)$

so $latex C^\infty$ is a contravariant symmetric monoidal functor.

Then, the $latex C^\infty(M)$-module of vector fields on $latex M$ is the &#039;external&#039; tensor product of the $latex C^\infty(M_1)$-module of vector fields on $latex M_1$ and the $latex C^\infty(M_2)$-module of vector fields on $latex M_2.$  

I don&#039;t know if &#039;external&#039; is the right word, but I&#039;m referring to the standard way to take a module over a commutative algebra $latex A$ and a module over a commutative algebra $latex B$ and tensor them to get a module over the a commutative algebra $latex A \otimes B$, which is different than the usual way of taking two $latex A$-modules and tensoring them to get a new $latex A$-module.  This gives a functor

$latex A\mathrm{Mod} \times B\mathrm{Mod} \to 
(A \otimes B)\mathrm{Mod}$ 

There&#039;s a way to take a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mat.uc.pt/~workCT/slides/Ignacio.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;tensor product of categories with finite colimits&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes called the &#039;box tensor product&#039; $latex \boxtimes.$ and then I believe we the above functor gives rise to an equivalence

$latex A\mathrm{Mod} \boxtimes B\mathrm{Mod} \simeq 
(A \otimes B)\mathrm{Mod}$ 

which is what I&#039;m calling the &#039;external tensor product&#039;.  So, I believe `Mod&#039; is also a symmetric monoidal (2-)functor in a suitable sense.

You may be more familiar with all of this in the geometric picture where we take a vector bundle over $latex M_1$ and a vector bundle over $latex M_2$ and tensor them to get a vector bundle over $latex M_1 \times M_2$.  This &#039;external&#039; tensor product of vector bundles is different than (but closely related to) the perhaps more commonly discussed recipe where we take two vector bundles over a manifold and tensor them to get another vector bundle over the same manifold.  The external tensor product of the tangent bundles of $latex M_1$ and $latex M_2$ is the tangent bundle of $latex M_1 \times M_2.$

In short, I believe everything is `as monoidal as it should be&#039;.]]></description>

To add to John&#039;s comment: I don&#039;t understand the global geometric structure  behind port-Hamiltonian formalism.  It is said in many sources that the structure is a Dirac structure (more careful practitioners would say  &quot;Courant algebroids&quot;) but that&#039;s not quite right, mainly because there is dissipation.    I have spent quite a bit of time being confused by that --- how could a Dirac structure have dissipation?  In the port-Hamiltonian formalism dissipation is modeled by adding a metric-like structure.    I don&#039;t know enough physics to judge if this is a good way to go.   My impression is that dissipative systems are notoriously hard to model well.  I&#039;d love to be persuaded  that the so-called metri-plectic structures (i.e. metric and symplectic) and their Courant algebroid analogues are good models of reality.]]></description>

I know about them, and Eugene knows even more about them.  Eugene&#039;s formalism presented here is more general, but it doesn&#039;t incorporate conservation of energy, which one certainly wants in some situations.  You could say he&#039;s studying networks of general dynamical systems, but we also want symplectic and Poisson versions of this theory.  Port-hamiltonian systems are a big step in that direction, but I would love to see a more mathematical treatment that really treats these systems as networks.  They should have an underlying graph, there should be rules for sticking them together, etc.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Have you come across the &quot;port-Hamiltonian systems&quot; formalism from control engineering?  I&#039;m only just getting started exploring it but as I understand it it is a method to decompose dynamical systems into networks of open systems which preserving physical invariants like conservation of energy, so you get to keep a lot of the nice geometry of Hamiltonian systems: http://www.icm2006.org/proceedings/Vol_III/contents/ICM_Vol_3_65.pdf

There are links to thermodynamics and entropy in the theory as well: http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.1213]]></description>
