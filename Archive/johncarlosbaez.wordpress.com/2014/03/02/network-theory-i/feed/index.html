&lt;blockquote&gt;I think the way we’re doing things is less different from the ‘usual’ way than you believe&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I think that if you see things from afar then there are no differences and it&#039;s clearly the same thing.

However looking closely i feel that there are a few small differences (either in the conventions used or in the underlying formalization, or both) which i haven&#039;t been able to pinpoint exactly yet.

It looks like there might be slight differences in the set of assumptions regarding inputs, outputs, the signals&#039; direction of propagation, and a preferential direction in which component are drawn ... anyway, all interesting stuff.]]></description>

I&#039;m busy travelling from Cambridge to Erlangen today so I&#039;ll answer your questions tomorrow!  The issue is that I&#039;m trying to describe signal flow diagrams as morphisms in a category, and this automatically forces certain ways of thinking---ways that I&#039;m completely used to, but apparently go against how practitioners of control theory (or at least you) like to think!]]></description>

I am sure it&#039;s just me just not fully getting the &quot;rules of the game&quot;, probably because i&#039;m starting from my own assumptions.

Maybe what&#039;s going on is that blocks are really rotation invariant but you are using similar symbols for different things (e.g. addition and coaddition) so you have to use the vertical ordering to eliminate the ambiguity of which one you are referring to.

And the fact that there are no clear input and output labels and no arrows does not help, i think.

For example if you have a relation F: U ~&#062; V would you say that there is a fixed direction from U to V (so u is always the input and u always the output) or not ? 

If i want to think at u as output and v as input can i use the same relation, and the same name and symbol in the flow diagram (and just connect it backwards), or i have to use the inverse relation F^-1 : V ~&#062; U  (and maybe call it coF or something ?).

Related to this, i kind of assume i&#039;s forbidden to connect two inputs directly by an identity morphism, but i might be wrong on that one too.

Sorry about the many questions, hopefully they at least make some sense to you, anyway ... just trying to get to the bottom of this.]]></description>

Thanks for helping us start thinking about what we&#039;ll need to say to be comprehensible to control theorists.  I think the way we&#039;re doing things is less different from the &#039;usual&#039; way than you believe; in fact I feel we&#039;re just formalizing the usual way.  In particular, I believe that ordinary signal flow diagrams give, in general, relations between inputs and outputs rather than just functions.  But to explain this requires examples and pictures... so instead of trying to convince you here, I&#039;ll make sure we write the paper in a way that includes these!]]></description>

Ok, thanks to both of you for your answers. I see now that the components are not invariant under rotation. 

This is a big departure from the way control engineers are used to think about flow diagrams, where each components has input and output labels and as long as outputs are connected to inputs then the diagram represents some dynamical system, (or anyway just a system of equations). 

Arrows are there just as an additional help, but really the directionality is only given by the components, which are seen as functions (&lt;i&gt;not relations&lt;/i&gt;) which process inputs to produce outputs. John said something about that &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2014/02/06/categories-in-control/#comment-36161&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

In these kinds of flow diagrams one just rotate (and stretch) anything and nothing changes (provided that the same outputs are connected to the same inputs), because the underlying equations are the same. 

When you introduce relations into the mix then you probably gain a lot of power to represent more things in a more compact way, but i think that the rules about what is an input and what is an output and especially which you can connect to which, become a little less obvious, at least from my point of view. 

I think that this (the introduction of relations) is probably why in this this formalism the vertical ordering of generators is important, and, as Jason said, you need to preserve it, and you need to make sure that &quot;individual components have all input wires above the component, and all output wires below the component&quot;.

So i think that if you end up talking to control engineers it might be important to stress these differences ...

Thanks]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yes: read about &lt;a href=&quot;http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/2-rig&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;2-rigs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/rig+category&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;rig category&lt;/a&gt; on the nLab.  

There are a number of related notions here, and it takes a little effort to see which one you need for a given purpose, but very often what you want is a symmetric monoidal category with finite colimits such that taking the tensor product with any object gives a functor that distributes over colimits.  This is my own personal favorite definition of 2-rig.  Examples include $latex (\mathrm{Set}, \times, +)$ and $latex (\mathrm{Vect}, \otimes, \oplus)$, where the addition in both cases is the coproduct, a special case of finite colimits.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
 Has a nice, graphical language been developed to deal with this? I think that could be quite helpful…
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The obvious graphical notation here gets a bit awkward so people don&#039;t seem to use it much.  The problem is that if we denote $latex \otimes$ using parallel wires, we need to make up some slightly awkward notation for $latex \oplus,$ and vice versa.  At least, nobody has found a notation where the distributive law is &#039;visually obvious&#039; and also easy to draw.  You can use 3d diagrams with $latex \otimes$ going in one direction and $latex \oplus$ in another, but it seems to be more pain than it&#039;s worth.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have a question. I like to play with tensor networks (for quantum many-body systems) and we frequently use tensor network diagrams as a tool for representing quantum states, operators, etc. These are the symmetric monoidal category using the tensor product (and also a dagger). This lets us deal with tensor contractions - generally speaking, multiplication.

But sometimes I want to add things. Perhaps the superposition of two wavefunctions or the sum of two operators. Or perhaps it is useful to perform the direct sum of two vector spaces (for instance, we take advantage of symmetries by breaking up the Hilbert space into its different symmetry sectors). However, in these cases I find that drawing diagrams becomes more difficult. I didn&#039;t realize until today that we can have a symmetric monoidal category with parallel wires being direct sums (actually I had been using diagrams for these recently without realizing it - that seems to be the beauty of category theory).

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2014/03/02/network-theory-i/#comment-37743&quot;&gt;Giampiero Campa&lt;/a&gt;.

I asked myself that same question today. The answer I came up with is that he wants every &quot;network diagram&quot; to, overall, denote &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; morphism (which is a composition of the morphisms expressed by each &quot;tier&quot; of the network diagram as you move from &quot;top&quot; to &quot;bottom&quot;). And yet, I have the same intuition as you: I feel like I ought to be able to draw a &quot;1/s&quot; triangle and an &quot;s&quot; triangle that feed into each other, which would denote the &quot;claim&quot; that those triangles are inverses. What does this mean? Well, I suppose it asserts that if I were to expand out the diagram, replacing one of the identity morphisms by a duplication (and declaring that the &quot;top&quot; of the diagram) and replacing another line by a coduplication (declaring that the &quot;bottom&quot; of the diagram), the resulting diagram would denote a relation which is actually a proper (total) function.

But suppose I have three transformers. Maybe I&#039;m feeding the output of multiply-by-2 into multiply-by-4 and feeding the output of multiply-by-4 into multiply-by-0.125 and the output of multiply-by-0.125 back into multiply-by-2. Now I have a bunch of places to put the &quot;top&quot; and the &quot;bottom&quot; of the diagram (six, to be precise). No matter which I choose, the relation denoted should still be a proper function. Whereas, if I change one of the scalars to 3, the relation denoted should become {(0,0)}, no matter where I put the top and bottom.

It seems to me like there ought to be a formal sense in which we can talk about diagrams where the top and bottom are unspecified. That is, there should be certain conditions/contexts under which the choice of top and bottom &quot;don&#039;t matter&quot;.

In fact, given that we switched from maps to relations, it&#039;s not clear what purpose the distinction between &quot;inputs&quot; and &quot;outputs&quot; serves. We could just call everything an input. The space of relations doesn&#039;t change. If this makes sense, then it might be easier to talk about diagrams with no inputs: instead of choosing a &quot;top&quot; and a &quot;bottom&quot;, we only need to choose a &quot;top&quot;: replace one line with a duplication and now we have a relation with a single input, i.e., a subset of the field. Then, the condition I proposed above would just become &quot;the subset is the entire field&quot;. (Though, in some contexts, we might also want to assert other properties of such a subset, like, &quot;it contains elements distinct from 0&quot;. A parallel with universal and existential quantification.)]]></description>

<p>I asked myself that same question today. The answer I came up with is that he wants every &#8220;network diagram&#8221; to, overall, denote <i>a</i> morphism (which is a composition of the morphisms expressed by each &#8220;tier&#8221; of the network diagram as you move from &#8220;top&#8221; to &#8220;bottom&#8221;). And yet, I have the same intuition as you: I feel like I ought to be able to draw a &#8220;1/s&#8221; triangle and an &#8220;s&#8221; triangle that feed into each other, which would denote the &#8220;claim&#8221; that those triangles are inverses. What does this mean? Well, I suppose it asserts that if I were to expand out the diagram, replacing one of the identity morphisms by a duplication (and declaring that the &#8220;top&#8221; of the diagram) and replacing another line by a coduplication (declaring that the &#8220;bottom&#8221; of the diagram), the resulting diagram would denote a relation which is actually a proper (total) function.</p>
<p>But suppose I have three transformers. Maybe I&#8217;m feeding the output of multiply-by-2 into multiply-by-4 and feeding the output of multiply-by-4 into multiply-by-0.125 and the output of multiply-by-0.125 back into multiply-by-2. Now I have a bunch of places to put the &#8220;top&#8221; and the &#8220;bottom&#8221; of the diagram (six, to be precise). No matter which I choose, the relation denoted should still be a proper function. Whereas, if I change one of the scalars to 3, the relation denoted should become {(0,0)}, no matter where I put the top and bottom.</p>

It is actually possible to eliminate both Zero and Deletion as generators for FinRel.  5 seems to be the minimum number of generators needed, but getting rid of too many generators, willy-nilly, seems to muddy up the picture.

The simplest way to eliminate Deletion is by using Duplication!  That is, Duplication followed by a cup.  The simplest way I&#039;ve found to make Zero redundant is by using Scalar-multiplication... by zero.  With a Codeletion on top.  Your first Zero is equivalent to this when you use the relation involving (b+c) on the slide that shows you get the rig structure of $latex k$ back.  Your picture at the end is very nice, though.  I had not thought of trying to make Zero redundant without the use of Scalar-multiplication.]]></description>
