An interesting read... The West Antarctic Ice Sheet is the ice sheet that covers Antarctica on the Western Hemisphere side of the Transantarctic Mountains. The bed of this ice sheet lies well below sea level. The ice gradually flows into floating ice shelves such as the Ross Ice Shelf and Ronne Ice Shelf, and also glaciers that dump ice into the Amundsen Sea.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[About 400 years ago Galileo got into trouble by putting knowledge on the table in a game with belief systems, and lost. Today most of us would agree that those belief systems were simultaneously driven by, and used as a primary tool, *fear*. Galileo really should have won, we think, if the game would have really been fair. 

400 years after the West Antarctica ice sheet disappears-- in a complete surprise to almost everybody except people like us (we think)-- what will be the consensus then? Somebody of that day and age will of course have to write a book about it, with a title something like--

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2014/05/16/west-antarctic-ice-sheet-news/#comment-44287&quot;&gt;Uncle Al&lt;/a&gt;.

Well, it depends, and we don&#039;t really know. I&#039;m betting half of glaciologists are blowing their jets right now tuning up models to be able to produce a single graph: A three dimensional posterior probability density giving mass to rate of flow per month versus year out for the next 500 years. Glaciers are complicated mechanisms.  Even with such a model, which would need to be simulated on one of the Big Guys (supercomputers), needing, at my last check, at least 50m by 50m resolution, there still needs to be fieldwork done to establish good initial conditions.  There&#039;s only so much that can be done from satellite and aircraft. 

I guess you could bound how fast these could go from what&#039;s been seen elsewhere, like Alaska, and Greenland, per &quot;Chasing Ice&quot;.]]></description>
