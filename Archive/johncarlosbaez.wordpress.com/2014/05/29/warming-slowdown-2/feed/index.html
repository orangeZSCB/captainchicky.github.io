					<description><![CDATA[TG and John, 

Note I also had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2014/04/11/what-does-the-new-ipcc-report-say-about-climate-change-part-4/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;link to Steve Easterbrook&#039;s fine &lt;i&gt;Azimuth&lt;/i&gt; article on the IPCC AR5&lt;/a&gt; which highlighted this same data. 

As John suggested, if the calculations of error bars are wanted for yourself, you&#039;ll need to reproduce Levitus, &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt; and whatever sources &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; used.  It&#039;s instructive to do so.  I got the material for these posts by trying to reproduce Fyfe, Gillet, and Zwiers, with help from Zwiers.  There&#039;s a lot to learn.  I needed to learn quite a bit about HadCRUT4, for example.  That&#039;s why, for instance, the successful reproduction of a result like &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2014/07/08/el-nino-project-part-4/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;that by Graham Jones of the the Ludescher et al results&lt;/a&gt; is such a thing to be celebrated. In my opinion, it is an exercise critically important to understanding how science works, especially these complicated geophysical results. 

To my comment earlier, I did not understand which &quot;error bars&quot; you, TG, were interested in doing.  I know they have a use, but I really tend not to use these for anything serious these days, certainly not in my professional work.  I look for posteriors on parameters.  Here, if modeling, I would probably look at the time dependent posterior on the first time derivative of ocean heat content at specific profile depths. 

I am a big fan of the ARGO float system, something to which &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whoi.edu&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;WHOI&lt;/a&gt; contributed, with many others.  I actually used some ARGO data to illustrate the frequentist bootstrap in a mini-course.  See &lt;a href=&quot;http://azimuth.ch.mm.st/WarmingSlowdownQ/19November2012BootstrapResamplingWithIndependentData--JGalkowski.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;beginning slide 31 of this PDF file&lt;/a&gt;. I have also &lt;a href=&quot;http://azimuth.ch.mm.st/WarmingSlowdownQ/BootstrapPresentations--Independent.R&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;put the &lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt; code which generates the ARGO data there&lt;/a&gt;, although much of the rest of the presentation is included in the same file.  If you need accompanying datasets, let me know.  I apologize for the lack of documentation.  In the course of business, we at Akamai generally assume people know the language and the problem, and rely upon the occasional comment, and liberal use of asserts (&quot;stopifnot&quot;) to document semantics. If intended for a broader audience, the code deserves better documentation.  On the other hand, the code there or, for that matter, what I eventually provided for &quot;Warming Slowdown&quot;, is comparable or better in documentation quality to most found in the &lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt; Project source codes. 


If you are interested in diving deeper (hah), I&#039;d suggest a couple of papers there, encourage understanding, and reading around the references to get educated.  Oceanography is a really fascinating subject, so different than many others!

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2014/05/29/warming-slowdown-2/#comment-50967&quot;&gt;TG&lt;/a&gt;.

TG wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The title suggests it’s a plot of temperature but the axis shows heat content (?!)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I agree that it&#039;s a crappy title. It&#039;s the heat content that&#039;s being graphed here, in zettajoules:

&lt;img src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ecological/galkowski/OceanTemperaturesAtDepth_2013-10-09_025834.png&quot; /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The graph suggests that larger and larger subsets of the ocean contain the same heat content (?!) 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

No, it does not.  It shows how the heat content is increasing in 3 layers of the ocean: the layer 0-300 meters deep, the larger layer 0-700 meters deep, and the even larger layer 0-2000 meters deep.  

The colors of the lines are very poorly chosen, so it&#039;s hard to tell which line is which---unless you think about it, in which case there&#039;s only one possibility that makes sense: the bigger layers have to contain more heat.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
And---what initially caught my attention---there&#039;s no indication of how reliable the *measurements* are---whatever they are.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is a typical problem in the journalistic literature on science.  One has to work a bit.  Jan&#039;s picture here came from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yaleclimateconnections.org/2013/09/examining-the-recent-slow-down-in-global-warming/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Yale Climate Connections&lt;/a&gt; blog, and he was good enough to include a link.  They wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Total ocean heat content has increased by around 170 zettajoules since 1970, and about 255 zettajoules &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/media/pdf/q/s/Paper1_Observing_changes_in_the_climate_system.PDF&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;since 1955&lt;/a&gt;. This increased temperature has caused the oceans (0-2,000 meters) to warm about 0.09 C over this period. As the UK’s Met Office points out, if the same amount of energy had gone into the lower atmosphere it would of caused about 36 C (nearly 65 degrees F) warming! 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

They were good enough to include a link.  Clicking, one gets a paper from the UK Met Office which includes the same graph, and says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We now turn our attention to the ocean. As discussed in more detail in the second report in this series, the ocean is a very important component of the climate system as it acts as the planet’s primary heat store (Murphy et al. 2009, Palmer et al, 2011). Monitoring of the upper ocean, for example using the Argo array of drifting probes&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;, has not yet produced sufficiently long-term records to determine robust trends. However, as a key part of our observation of the full climate system these records are beginning to provide new insights and deepen our understanding. Below the depths reached by the Argo floats (2,000m maximum), observations of the ocean heat content are spatially sparse and temporally discontinuous.

&lt;b&gt;3.1 Ocean heat content&lt;/b&gt;

Approximately 90% of the heat trapped in the Earth system by increases in atmospheric greenhouse gases will eventually be stored in the ocean. The ocean heat content is a function of the huge mass of water that is in communication with the surface, and the massive thermal capacity of water compared to air.

Although surface temperature can be readily measured by satellites, and good historic records exist, the thin surface layer (i.e. millimetres in the case of satellites) represents a very small volume (relatively), and so is fairly unimportant in terms of heat content. It is much more difficult to measure the temperature of the interior of the ocean, as it cannot be done remotely (from satellites). For a long time, ship-borne instruments were the only way of measuring the sub-surface ocean temperature. The development of eXpendable BathyThermograph (XBT) in the 1960s allowed “ships of opportunity” with limited expertise to make measurements, and so the number of observations greatly increased.

Since about 2000, the Argo array of autonomous robotic ocean profiling floats has led to near global coverage with measurements of temperature to 700m (15-20% of the average open ocean depth), with more recent buoys measuring down to 2,000m (the upper 50%). However, the ice-covered and marginal seas still remain a technical challenge. Combining data from the Argo array with XBT and ship measurements, enables relatively long estimates of the heat stored in the upper 700m to be made (Figure 18). Comparing this record to the surface temperature record shows that, despite the surface warming pause since 2000, the ocean heat content in the upper ocean continued to rise.

There are much fewer observations below 700m, and the ocean below 2,000m has remained largely un-monitored. However, there is evidence of warming below 700m, and even below 2,000m. Careful processing of the available deep ocean records shows that the heat content of the upper 2,000m increased by 24 x 10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;J over the 1955–2010 period (Levitus, 2012), equivalent to 0.09°C warming of this layer. To put this into context, if the same energy had warmed the lower 10km of the atmosphere, it would have warmed by 36°C! While this will not happen, it does illustrate the importance of the ocean as a heat store.

---------
&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; Argo floats are small, drifting oceanic robotic probes that are deployed worldwide and drift with the ocean currents. The probes descend down to at most 2km, and once every 10 days they rise to the surface, measuring salinity and temperature profiles. The data are transmitted to shore via satellite. Argo floats began to be deployed in the early 2000s and currently there are over 3,500 floats across the global oceans.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

All this is very interesting and informative, but in our quest for error bars clearly we need to look up the reference to Levitus, which is &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2012GL051106/pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Since I play these games a lot all this takes just a couple minutes; it&#039;s taking me a lot longer to write this comment!

Luckily this paper is open-access... and like a good scientific paper, it has a graph with error bars:

&lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2012GL051106/pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ecological/ocean_heat_levitus.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

You have to read the paper if you want to know the details.  (And then read the papers &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; refers to.)

So: if you really care about these things, you have to follow the trail of breadcrumbs back further and further.  Journalists, trying to communicate to ordinary people, throw out the error bars.  ]]></description>

<p>I agree that it&#8217;s a crappy title. It&#8217;s the heat content that&#8217;s being graphed here, in zettajoules:</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>No, it does not.  It shows how the heat content is increasing in 3 layers of the ocean: the layer 0-300 meters deep, the larger layer 0-700 meters deep, and the even larger layer 0-2000 meters deep.  </p>
<p>The colors of the lines are very poorly chosen, so it&#8217;s hard to tell which line is which&#8212;unless you think about it, in which case there&#8217;s only one possibility that makes sense: the bigger layers have to contain more heat.</p>

<p>This is a typical problem in the journalistic literature on science.  One has to work a bit.  Jan&#8217;s picture here came from the <a href="http://www.yaleclimateconnections.org/2013/09/examining-the-recent-slow-down-in-global-warming/" rel="nofollow">Yale Climate Connections</a> blog, and he was good enough to include a link.  They wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Total ocean heat content has increased by around 170 zettajoules since 1970, and about 255 zettajoules <a href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/media/pdf/q/s/Paper1_Observing_changes_in_the_climate_system.PDF" rel="nofollow">since 1955</a>. This increased temperature has caused the oceans (0-2,000 meters) to warm about 0.09 C over this period. As the UK’s Met Office points out, if the same amount of energy had gone into the lower atmosphere it would of caused about 36 C (nearly 65 degrees F) warming!
</p></blockquote>
<p>They were good enough to include a link.  Clicking, one gets a paper from the UK Met Office which includes the same graph, and says:</p>
<blockquote><p>
We now turn our attention to the ocean. As discussed in more detail in the second report in this series, the ocean is a very important component of the climate system as it acts as the planet’s primary heat store (Murphy et al. 2009, Palmer et al, 2011). Monitoring of the upper ocean, for example using the Argo array of drifting probes<sup>8</sup>, has not yet produced sufficiently long-term records to determine robust trends. However, as a key part of our observation of the full climate system these records are beginning to provide new insights and deepen our understanding. Below the depths reached by the Argo floats (2,000m maximum), observations of the ocean heat content are spatially sparse and temporally discontinuous.</p>
<p><b>3.1 Ocean heat content</b></p>
<p>Approximately 90% of the heat trapped in the Earth system by increases in atmospheric greenhouse gases will eventually be stored in the ocean. The ocean heat content is a function of the huge mass of water that is in communication with the surface, and the massive thermal capacity of water compared to air.</p>
<p>Although surface temperature can be readily measured by satellites, and good historic records exist, the thin surface layer (i.e. millimetres in the case of satellites) represents a very small volume (relatively), and so is fairly unimportant in terms of heat content. It is much more difficult to measure the temperature of the interior of the ocean, as it cannot be done remotely (from satellites). For a long time, ship-borne instruments were the only way of measuring the sub-surface ocean temperature. The development of eXpendable BathyThermograph (XBT) in the 1960s allowed “ships of opportunity” with limited expertise to make measurements, and so the number of observations greatly increased.</p>
<p>Since about 2000, the Argo array of autonomous robotic ocean profiling floats has led to near global coverage with measurements of temperature to 700m (15-20% of the average open ocean depth), with more recent buoys measuring down to 2,000m (the upper 50%). However, the ice-covered and marginal seas still remain a technical challenge. Combining data from the Argo array with XBT and ship measurements, enables relatively long estimates of the heat stored in the upper 700m to be made (Figure 18). Comparing this record to the surface temperature record shows that, despite the surface warming pause since 2000, the ocean heat content in the upper ocean continued to rise.</p>
<p>There are much fewer observations below 700m, and the ocean below 2,000m has remained largely un-monitored. However, there is evidence of warming below 700m, and even below 2,000m. Careful processing of the available deep ocean records shows that the heat content of the upper 2,000m increased by 24 x 10<sup>22</sup>J over the 1955–2010 period (Levitus, 2012), equivalent to 0.09°C warming of this layer. To put this into context, if the same energy had warmed the lower 10km of the atmosphere, it would have warmed by 36°C! While this will not happen, it does illustrate the importance of the ocean as a heat store.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br />
<sup>8</sup> Argo floats are small, drifting oceanic robotic probes that are deployed worldwide and drift with the ocean currents. The probes descend down to at most 2km, and once every 10 days they rise to the surface, measuring salinity and temperature profiles. The data are transmitted to shore via satellite. Argo floats began to be deployed in the early 2000s and currently there are over 3,500 floats across the global oceans.
</p></blockquote>
<p>All this is very interesting and informative, but in our quest for error bars clearly we need to look up the reference to Levitus, which is <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2012GL051106/pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Since I play these games a lot all this takes just a couple minutes; it&#8217;s taking me a lot longer to write this comment!</p>

How would I do it? I&#039;m not sure, sorry.

Although I would begin by replacing figure 1 with something that actually makes sense. The title suggests it&#039;s a plot of temperature but the axis shows heat content(?!) The graph suggests that larger and larger subsets of the ocean contain the same heat content(?!) And---what initially caught my attention---there&#039;s no indication of how reliable the *measurements* are---whatever they are.]]></description>
