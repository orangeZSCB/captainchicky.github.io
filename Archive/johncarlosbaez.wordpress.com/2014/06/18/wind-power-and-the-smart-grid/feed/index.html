					<description><![CDATA[As long as operators like the grids don&#039;t claim &quot;proprietary information&quot; regarding their instantaneous loads, or generators don&#039;t similarly deny such information flow, it seems to me that there are plenty of people out their with control systems savvy who would be interested in coming into the system and providing guidance on load balancing and shedding. 

I know there are always fears of instability in such macroscale control systems, but I and my colleagues at Akamai Technologies deal with loads and shifting demands and emergent behavior on such a macroscale system every day, the Internet.  It &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; be done.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2014/06/18/wind-power-and-the-smart-grid/#comment-50574&quot;&gt;John Baez&lt;/a&gt;.

Maybe for future reference then, each embedded controller running its own Petri net is really a player in a game. The game is to create systems from players, specifically a &quot;distributed&quot; system, where parts are independent in the sense of being distributed, and where by virtue of being in the same system, the state of one element of the system can carry information about another part of the system.

In a workshop at Stanford on business applications of his work on situation theory, Jon Barwise gave an example that always stuck in my mind. He was writing on an overhead projector about this concept of a distributed system. We were looking at Jon and reading the screen on which his diagramming was projected. Israel asked him for an example, and Jon stepped in-between the overhead projector and the projection screen. He had broken the system. The state of the projection no longer carried any information about the state of the sheet upon which he was writing on the overhead projector.

By breaking the beam of light from the overhead projector to the projection screen, Jon had broken an &quot;information channel.&quot; Obviously.

So an information channel is a distributed system, which is how it can carry information. 

It&#039;s a restatement of the above problem statement. To avoid the exponential explosion of centralized control, local players have to, instead, pick up information from other members of the systems of which they are members. Their states are related states by virtue of both being in the same system, even though distributed differently from each other.

Players with no ability for joining a distributed system lose funding.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;With better prediction, Xcel can do a better job of shutting down idling backup plants on days when they’re not needed. Last year was a breakthrough year – better forecasts saved Xcel nearly as much money as they had in the three previous years combined.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By the way how much does Xcel pay for this NCAR service?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Fluctuations in regional wind energy follows a Rayleigh distribution, which is one of the most basic Maximum Entropy formulations. Put that together with a constant integrated kinetic energy, and you have to figure that the wind is blowing &lt;i&gt;somewhere&lt;/i&gt;.  Put that knowledge together with a smart grid and you might see the start of spatial load balancing.

Perhaps easier stated than done because of transmission losses.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[John, I recall talking with a researcher on the smart grid at NIST some years ago. He was interested in controllers that talk to each other locally and adapt to power variability without the overhead of centralized control. For an example of embedded controllers talking to each using internet protocols, I told him about some actual  products offered by one company that I knew of.

The control language for their embedded controllers derives from Petri nets.
