John,

I will generate the canonical differential equation in a bit. There is not too much to it. I am essentially following the recipe of the sloshing dynamics algorithm, which is a modified Mathieu DiffEq.  It is actually a significant  simplification in contrast to the charge/discharge delay oscillator that I see mentioned quite often.  The latter is intractable as far as getting any meaningful results from.

What is striking is that the sloshing in a volume the size of the tanker likely has similar dynamics to the sloshing of the much larger volume of the Pacific ocean.   It won&#039;&#039;t be the first or last time that scaling works.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Furthermore, I think you should need to pay in some way for the time series data you are using! Otherwise you could get a better and better fit at little or no cost by using more and more time series.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I also tested the approach on coral proxy data which dates back a thousand years. This has been shown to be a sensitive measure of ENSO behavior. 
http://contextearth.com/2014/06/25/proxy-confirmation-of-soim/

What is interesting about that blog post is that it was dated within a day of this top-level post and it showed what I was working on when I caught wind of what you guys were working on.  So in the last year it has been an essentially a part-time effort to see if I could mature the concept and push it along via the Azimuth Forum.]]></description>

It depends how you count them.  I think the fair way is to write down the differential equation whereby you compute your estimate of the SOI from the other time series you are using (QBO, Chandler Wobble and TSI).  At the very least, this differential equation has some constants in it, which have to be chosen to get a good fit.  You have to pay for these constants.

Furthermore, I think you should need to pay in some way for the time series data you are using!  Otherwise you could get a better and better fit at little or no cost by using more and more time series.

We can talk to an expert on Aikake Information Criterion to see what they say.  But I don&#039;t think they&#039;ll say your model has just 1 free variable.

They may say some variant of the AIC is more suitable for models of this sort, where you are using a formula to compute an estimate of 1 time series from $latex n$ other time series.  I bet such a variant will include a penalty involving $latex n.$]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  After reading the Tsonis paper and being underwhelmed by his findings, I thought I would give it a chance.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I see.  Yes, this and the other paper you mention are among the &#039;climate networks&#039; papers we looked at while working on the El Ni&#241;o project.

The thing is, the &#039;network&#039; methodology used in these papers is fashionable right now among physicists.  They&#039;re applying this methodology to everything, right now.   I think that&#039;s the main reason these papers got into &lt;em&gt;PRL&lt;/em&gt;: applying a fashionable methodology to an important problem is a good way to get into a prestigious journal, regardless of how solid the results actually are.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  The bottom line is that I am in no hurry to get it published.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Okay.  So far you seem to be showing little interest in having me, or the rest of the Azimuth gang, help you get it published.  If we did this, I think we&#039;d start by performing statistical tests and examining the energy flows to see if we can make a strong case for this theory.  It turned out we could, then we&#039;d help you rewrite the paper to include that material, and also adjust the style to maximize the chance of getting in some specific journal (to be determined as soon as possible).]]></description>

John,
The reason I picked PRL is because they  published a paper by Tsonis and Swanson called &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.228502&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&quot;Topology and Predictability of El Ni√±o and La Ni√±a Networks&quot;&lt;/a&gt; in Jan 2008.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We construct the networks of the surface temperature field for El Ni√±o and for La Ni√±a years and investigate their structure. We find that the El Ni√±o network possesses significantly fewer links and lower clustering coefficient and characteristic path length than the La Ni√±a network, which indicates that the former network is less communicative and less stable than the latter. We conjecture that because of this, predictability of temperature should decrease during El Ni√±o years. Here we verify that indeed during El Ni√±o years predictability is lower compared to La Ni√±a years.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There was also this later that year:

&#8226; &quot;Climate Networks around the Globe are Significantly Affected by El Ni√±o&quot;, K. Yamasaki, A. Gozolchiani, and S. Havlin, &lt;i&gt;Phys. Rev. Lett.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;100&lt;/b&gt;, 228501, 5 June 2008

PRL is a prestige journal, and they will publish groundbreaking work in any physics-related discipline.   After reading the Tsonis paper and being underwhelmed by his findings, I thought I would give it a chance.

Agree that if I try to sell it as a heuristic, it won&#039;t cut it for PRL.   The bottom-line is that I am in no hurry to get it published.]]></description>

I know &lt;em&gt;Physical Review Letters&lt;/em&gt;, and I haven&#039;t seen many papers on this sort of topic---that could be why it got rejected without comment.  To succeed in publishing in a journal, I&#039;ve always had to read lots of papers in that journal and make sure my paper &#039;fits in&#039;, meaning it&#039;s about a subject that appears in that journal, uses similar methods, is written in a roughly similar style, etc.  If you could point me to similar papers in &lt;em&gt;Phys. Rev. Lett.&lt;/em&gt;, then I could help diagnose what needs to be done to publish a paper like this there.  If not, perhaps another journal would be better.

Anyway, one should expect a novel paper to be rejected a couple of times, and this one is novel.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  That being said, a pragmatic question would be to ask why is it even necessary to provide a complete physical basis?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Well, suppose you found a wonderful fit between the Southern Oscillation Index and the price of a certain stock.  This would be very hard to publish, because people would think it was a coincidence (unless the company sold raincoats or something).  People want to see more than a curve matching another curve: they want to be convinced that there&#039;s a good reason.]]></description>

John, I submitted to Physical Review Letters and it got rejected without review.

The physics is solid IMO and is based on the hydrodynamics of sloshing.   The three factors that I am combining are individually cited in the ENSO research literature. QBO is well known as a forcing, the Chandler Wobble is suggested by JPL, and the TSI is hypothesized.

The idea of AIC is that it evaluates the quality of a model by penalizing by the number of free variables available.  As it sits, this model has no free variables apart from scaling, so it should rate high on the AIC scale.  The statistical significance of the fit is also very high as the likelihood of fixed factors combining to coincidentally match such an erratic time series is close to zero.

Substantiating via an energy flow argument is probably a good idea.  The issue is that sloshing of the thermocline (as you are showing with the animated 3D gifs) is very sensitive to the &lt;i&gt;density differences&lt;/i&gt; in the upper and lower layers. Consider a stratified oil and water mix in a beaker. It only takes a slight forcing to get that in motion. So what I suspect is happening with the ocean is that  the radiation is modulating the density of the upper layer.

That being said, a pragmatic question would be to ask why is it even necessary to provide a complete physical basis?  That is especially true if what many people are after is simply a good heuristic.   As a heuristic alone, the model beats anything I have seen so far.   GCMs create different outcomes every time they are run.]]></description>

Why do you say it&#039;s difficult?   Have you tried?  If so, what have the responses been?

I suspect the main difficulty will be convincing climate scientists that the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO), the Chandler Wobble, and the total solar irradiance (TSI) have the potential to be major determinants of the El Ni&#241;o Southern Oscillation (ENSO).

Just getting the curve to fit won&#039;t be enough to convince them.  They&#039;ll want to see evidence that it&#039;s physically plausible: that is, calculations based on physics explaining how these causes could create the observed ENSO.  For example, it would be good to see a kind of &#039;energy budget&#039;, tracking the flow of energy.

They&#039;ll also want to see a statistical argument showing that the curve fit is statistically significant, not coincidence.  The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akaike_information_criterion&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Aikake information criterion&lt;/a&gt; might be helpful, though I&#039;m not an expert on it.

Are you interested in those 2 projects?  I&#039;d find them pretty interesting.  Indeed, only after doing something like this could I say I believe your model, despite how impressively it fits the data.]]></description>

<p>Are you interested in those 2 projects?  I&#8217;d find them pretty interesting.  Indeed, only after doing something like this could I say I believe your model, despite how impressively it fits the data.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2014/06/24/el-nino-project-part-2/#comment-51623&quot;&gt;WebHubTelescope&lt;/a&gt;.

To provide some resolution to the above comment.  I worked a couple of hours per week on the problem and after several months came up with a model that demonstrates incredible fidelity to the ENSO SOI measurement, from 1880 to the present time.  The key forcing factors to the Mathieu equation are the QBO, the Chandler Wobble, and the TSI signal. These are all periodic and also provide the basis for the Mathieu (more accurately Hill) modulation factor.

This answers John&#039;s question in the above blog post:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Another thing you‚Äôll see from is that the ENSO is far from perfectly periodic! Here‚Äôs a graph of the Southern Oscillation Index going back a lot further:&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The bottom line is that ENSO is only quasi-periodic as it depends on the input cyclic forcing factors, the characteristic frequency of the sloshing wave equation, and the modulation.  Taken as an aggregate, it is no wonder that this problem was difficult to crack!

I wrote up a research paper on the results and it is on ARXIV

http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1411/1411.0815.pdf

I am currently at an impasse because it is difficult to get the paper published in a scientific journal, as we all seem to lack any academic or research lab credentials in the climate field. You have to wonder how &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Carlo_Chandler&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Seth Carlo Chandler&lt;/a&gt; got his results published on the Chandler Wobble, especially when you  consider his real job was as an actuary ...    I guess you have to have connections :)

					<description><![CDATA[There is another factor which contributes ... Ocean surfaces, even after averaging out waves, are not level. In many instances there is an overall slope, something not very steep, about 1 meter in 100 kilometers, but something which contributes to current flow. This happens because normals to isobaric surfaces are not parallel to gravitational vectors. This situation can be unstable, but it also can be stabilized by an outside force, sometimes the important Coriolis force. 

What&#039;s the Coriolis?  The easiest way, I think, to visualize Coriolis is to note that on a rotating sphere, the angular velocity of a mass particle at a high latitude is smaller than the velocity of one near the Equator. That&#039;s because the circumference of the circle at latitude L  is $latex 2 \pi R \cos{L}$, expressing L in radians and R being the radius of the sphere. Thus $latex \frac{d}{dt}$ of that is

$latex \frac{d(2 \pi R \cos{L})}{dL} = -2 \pi R \sin{L}$

What happens if, starting from a point significantly north of the Equator, because of a current, the particle moves due south? Well, it finds itself among particles which are moving faster west-to-east than it was moving, and, so, it drifts west. The situation is flipped if the particle was initially south of the Equator, but the situation remains that the particle drifts west. 

This affects both oceans and atmosphere.]]></description>
