					<description><![CDATA[Unfortunately two upper images of the El Nino events look not fully consistent. That is I am talking about the images:

After the quote:
&lt;blockquote&gt; It’s hard to predict for more than 6 months in advance. It’s not periodic: it’s a quasi-periodic phenomenon that occurs across the tropical Pacific Ocean every 3 to 7 years.
&lt;/blockquote&gt; the image
&lt;a href=&quot;http://faculty.washington.edu/kessler/figures.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;by William Kessler (can&#039;t find it on his website).&lt;/a&gt;

and after the quote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;So, the average surface air temperature of the Earth may reach a new high when the next El Niño comes&quot; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; the image:

from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/service/global/enso-global-temp-anom/201213.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;NOAA.&lt;/a&gt;

So in particular the Kessler image is showing an El nino peak around 1978 (the exact year is hardly visible), all other peaks until the 1940&#039;s are smaller (in the negative sense,i.e. closer to 0) than this peak. However the NOAA image shows no peak around this year but only one in 1974, but a couple of other peaks until the 1950&#039;s. Frankly I find the Index diagram better than this annual bar diagram form NOAA, but the NOAA image is an offical release. Is there an official index diagram somewhere?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2014/06/20/el-nino-project-part-1/#comment-51451&quot;&gt;nad&lt;/a&gt;.

Let me preface that my blog posts are a means for me to track my progress in understanding. 

From the literature, there was some indication that the QBO could be influencing ENSO directly. The downwelling winds from the QBO could be agitating the ocean waters to stimulate the ENSO.  However, I could not get a good fit using QBO as a forcing function directly. The best I could do was use a few principal components (i.e. Fourier series factors) from the QBO and tweak those slightly.  This should inform us that perhaps that instead of  QBO acting as a direct stimulus to ENSO that there is a common factor to both QBO and ENSO. The two principal periodic components of 2.3 years and 2.7 years that I found underlying QBO correspond closely to the folded or aliased frequencies for the synodic/sidereal lunar monthly periods and draconic or nodal monthly periods, respectively. So I am currently leaning toward a lunar tidal influence as a forcing function to both QBO and ENSO.  Note that this is not a well accepted idea, as most theories for QBO follow Richard Lindzen&#039;s original idea for intrinsic atmospheric properties leading to emergent oscillations.

BTW, the various combinations of sidereal, draconic, and anomalistic lunar months lead to the 18.6, 8.85, and 6 year repeat periods. These are beat frequencies of the monthly periods interfering with each other.


As for the Mathieu equation, there are two schools of thought where it might apply.  On a literature search the first application  I found, dating back to 1929 and earlier, was as a spatio-temporal approximation to an elliptical basin. This leads to the same separable equations as an elliptical drumhead.
The second much more recent application is to describe the sloshing of fluid in an excited volume, such as in a fluid-filled tank in motion. The following paper is what I have been working from:
[1]J. B. Frandsen, “Sloshing motions in excited tanks,” Journal of Computational Physics, vol. 196, no. 1, pp. 53–87, 2004.


This is a discovery process for me, and if you read my blog posts you will see some dead ends and false starts.  The Chandler wobble connection may be a dead end, but it also may be useful along with all the angular momentum LOD (length of day)  measurements to pin down the origins of the forcing.

That&#039;s why I am excited to see what I can contribute and get on the correct path.]]></description>

The Mathieu equation is as described in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://booksite.elsevier.com/9780123846549/Chap_Mathieu.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; you cited the &quot;angular&quot; part of the Helmholtz equation obtained via a seperation of variables.(I didn&#039;t check this, but I hope it&#039;s right). Your fit looks interesting  but is there any way to motivate why the periodic terms for the CBO and Chandler wobble which you introduced &lt;a href=&quot;http://contextearth.com/2014/05/27/the-soim-differential-equation/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt; here &lt;/a&gt; go together with this rather special spatial distribution which enters that Ansatz?]]></description>

In &lt;a href=&quot;http://contextearth.com/2014/05/27/the-soim-differential-equation/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; it is written that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Since only a few periods were used to approximate the slightly varying QBO time series, the fit would not be expected to be perfect. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

What was the reason for this sampling? It seems you could improve your fitting if you don&#039;t use this sampling, no?

Furthermore you write:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The periodic perturbation in the wave equation, ω, is also assumed to be approximately 6 years based on the earlier analysis assuming an impulse response only. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

and in &lt;a href=&quot;http://contextearth.com/2014/05/02/the-soim-substantiating-the-chandler-wobble-and-tidal-connection-to-enso/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here:&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Consider that besides the Chandler Wobble, tidal periods of 18.6 years, 8.85 years, 6 years, and 16.9 years also exist, and if these get applied to as independent Mathieu periodicities, the fit improves markedly as shown in Figure 3.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

but here you &lt;a href=&quot;http://contextearth.com/2013/12/06/tidal-component-to-csalt/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;write:&lt;/a&gt;
If we look at the periods that control lunar tides -- the 18.613 year period and the 8.848 period 

So I miss somewhat a motivation for that 6 year period.]]></description>

Hi!  It would be &lt;i&gt;great&lt;/i&gt; if you could contribute, either by joining what we are doing or doing something in parallel and posting it to the Azimuth Blog.  Information on how to write Azimuth Blog articles is here:

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/How+to#blog&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How to write a blog entry&lt;/a&gt;,  Azimuth Wiki.

One of the steps is getting comments from the rest of the Azimuth members, so if you have an idea for an article and aren&#039;t quite sure we&#039;d like it, it&#039;s probably best to start by proposing the idea on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Forum+help&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Azimuth Forum&lt;/a&gt;.  

I&#039;d really love someone to write programs simulating the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/ENSO#ZCModel&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Zebiak--Cane model&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/ENSO#DelayedActionOscillator&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;delayed action oscillator model&lt;/a&gt; of the El Ni&#241;o Southern Oscillation, &lt;i&gt;especially&lt;/i&gt; if they (you?) wrote a nice blog article explaining the model and their software, with pictures.  Even &lt;i&gt;better&lt;/i&gt; would be a model that runs on a web browser, like our &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/coalbedo/stochastic/stochastic.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;stochastic energy balance model&lt;/a&gt; of ice albedo feedback!

If you want to see what we&#039;re doing now, try this discussion thread on the Azimuth Forum:

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;http://azimuth.mathforge.org/discussion/1358/3/experiments-in-el-nino-detection-and-prediction/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Azimuth Code Project: Experiments in El Ni&#241;o detection and prediction&lt;/a&gt;, Azimuth Forum.

There are other relevant threads, but this is the hub.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Looking very good.  I have a separate effort going in predicting ENSO and QBO, which have an apparent common underpinning. I am trying to make it as simple and concise as possible but can also volunteer towards a more ambitious route that you are embarking on.

My objective has been toward achieving a simple conceptual or abstract view of ENSO as the primary fluid dynamics component generating climate variability.  Having something concise and representative of the actual physics would go a long way to allowing (technical/non-technical/skeptical) sides to help deconstruct what is happening.  So what I always search for is the American Journal of Physics equivalent explanation.  Yet, as far as I can tell, there is nothing like that to describe ENSO other than the typical phenomenological discussions of geographical winds, waves, etc.

So what I am trying to do is create an abstract model of the principal sloshing behavior of ENSO and how that can be reduced to a more concise mathematical representation.
http://contextearth.com/2014/05/27/the-soim-differential-equation/

This is also useful in that it can be argued against. In other words, one can formulate an argument why this cannot work. That is often just as effective in gaining a common ground on our understanding. In this case it would explain why the sloshing of liquids that is adequately modeled at a macro-level (large containers filled with fluid) will not work at the super-macro-level of the ocean. So far, I hear the criticism that the Pacific Ocean is much too shallow in relation to its diameter for anything like this model to be applicable.

That is where I am coming from.  To create a network of nodes and how they can interoperate is the next logical step.  That is exciting and I hope to contribute somehow.  I tend to forget about the Azimuth Forum but will start to monitor . Thanks, Paul Pukite]]></description>
