					<description><![CDATA[Two new papers, including one on which &lt;em&gt;Tamino&lt;/em&gt; is a co-author:

J. S. Risbey, &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aaf342/meta&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;A fluctuation in surface temperature in historical context: reassessment and retrospective on the evidence&lt;/a&gt;&quot;, IOP &lt;em&gt;Environmental Research Letters&lt;/em&gt;, 2018.

S. Lewandowsky, &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aaf372/pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The ‘pause’ in global warming in historical context: (II). Comparing models to observations&lt;/a&gt;&quot;, IOP &lt;em&gt;Environmental Research Letters&lt;/em&gt;, 2018.

The second paper is particularly relevant to the post above.

&lt;em&gt;Tamino&lt;/em&gt; has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://tamino.wordpress.com/2018/12/19/global-warmings-pretend-pause/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;post about this&lt;/a&gt; at his blog. Cowtan and Lewandowsky have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/global-warming-hiatus-is-the-climate-change-myth-that-refuses-to-die-108524&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;popular treatment at &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>

That wouldn&#039;t mean there&#039;s no right and wrong here.  That would mean the natural variations need to be taken into account.   Obviously this is difficult, but I don&#039;t think throwing up our hands in despair is the answer (and you probably didn&#039;t really mean we should do that).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So I think the definitive articles closing this chapter of Geophysics have been written, with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2018.01107.x/full&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;last word provided by Professor Niamh Cahill of University College, Dublin, in this month&#039;s &lt;em&gt;Significance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a joint publication of the RSS and ASA, at least if its references are considered. The pingback system kindly provided (above) a link back to &lt;a href=&quot;https://667-per-cm.net/2018/02/14/less-evidence-for-a-global-warming-hiatus/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;my take on the closing scene&lt;/a&gt;, but it&#039;s worth considering this in the context of the joint project and celebration we all so avidly share.

To do Science or Statistics (and, to my mind, they are not quite the same), the scholar needs to risk being wrong. I sure have been, or excessively or prematurely harsh or hasty, &lt;a href=&quot;https://667-per-cm.net/2014/04/21/comment-on-timescales-for-detecting-a-significant-acceleration-in-sea-level-rise-by-haigh-et-al/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;at least once&lt;/a&gt; and possibly twice, although in the last case I decided to withdraw the post rather than defend it. I am lucky that my professional career does not depend upon professional courtesy in this field, or a rate of public accuracy.  That said, in these cases, I believed myself to be right and, in retrospect, given what I knew, I was justified. Nevertheless, even given the outcomes, I think my actions were the embodiment of a necessary process.

Similarly, the Fyfe, Gillett, and Zwiers paper which prompted my writing these two posts at &lt;em&gt;Azimuth&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;which&lt;/em&gt;, by the way, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1972/metrics&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;got picked up as part of the public technical discussion at &lt;em&gt;Nature Climate Change&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, all the more underscoring the important and prominence of our host, Professor John Baez) was based entirely on good process and faith. I had a discussion with Professor Zwiers about it. It posed a classical question using classical methods. That the methods were old, or disfavored in Statistics really didn&#039;t matter.

Ironically, the whole subject of the slowdown or &lt;em&gt;hiatus&lt;/em&gt; in warming for 2001-2014 became a major thing in the field, with the publication of the Lewandowsky, Risbey, Oreskes paper in 2016, arguing, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://tamino.wordpress.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tamino&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Grant Foster), that the slowdown was &lt;em&gt;bupkis&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meteo.psu.edu/holocene/public_html/Mann/articles/articles/FyfeEtAlNatureClimate16.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;response&lt;/a&gt;, arguing it was real, from a subset of what can only be called a Climate Science Pantheon, also in 2016, featuring the original Fyfe and Gillett, then Meehl, Hawkins, England, Xie, Flato, Kosaka, Swart, and, finally Michael Mann and Ben Santer!  &lt;em&gt;What to think?!&lt;/em&gt;

In the end, despite the desire to have &quot;process understanding&quot;, the matter was dispatched by showing that, climate models aside (or in support, depending upon how one looks at it), there is no defensible statistical evidence of a slowdown given recent data. Done. Period. The conclusion, in my opinion, was Cahill, Rahmstorf, and Parnell in 2015, with &quot;Change point analysis of global temperature&quot;. The more recent (Rahmstorf, Foster, and Cahill) &quot;Global temperature evolution: Recent trends and some pitfalls&quot; is wistful, forensic, and retrospective.

But this all exposed the intriguing questions which Lewandowsky, Risbey, and Oreskes exposed in their paper, about scientific process.   I would say that what we collectively learned was that methods and means of Science and Statistics are good for the problems, data, and needs of the period they are invented to serve, but, if they persist, and boundary conditions like data or needs change, they are likely to find themselves aground. This is &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt; because, in addition to being masters of a subject we are supposed to be good at, we really need to be interdisciplinary.

That&#039;s one of the many reasons I read &lt;em&gt;Azimuth&lt;/em&gt;, because  John is so adept at bringing together problems from so many fields, intriguing in itself, if exhausting.]]></description>
