Thanks for the feedback!

I&#039;ll tell the cameraman.  I&#039;m not sure the position of the camera was worse; I think it was similar to the first video.  In the second video the camera was more centered, but further away, and I thought my voice was hard to hear.  So, in the third video I tried to put the camera in the same position as for the first video.  Maybe the cameraman was just getting too excited about panning and zooming.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The camera position is not good in this video compared to the other two, making the cameramen change the direction and the zoom a lot, which makes me dizzy. the other videos were much better in that sense. 
other than that, I really like the seminar, and i will keep watching it. thank you for filming it.]]></description>
