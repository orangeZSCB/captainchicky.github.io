As a warmup for bringing statistical mechanics into the picture - and linear algebra over yet another rig - we recall how the dynamics  of particles becomes the statics of strings after Wick rotation. &lt;a href=&quot;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2007/01/quantization_and_cohomology_we_11.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Blog entry&lt;/a&gt;.

					<description><![CDATA[I remember an old discussion on sci.physics.research where James Dolan discussed a type of linear algebra based on Bellman&#039;s Dynamic Programming where addition was replaced by the minimization of costs and multiplication was replaced by the addition of costs. The transition costs for traversing a graph roughly corresponded to the action of classical mechanics so that minimizing the cost of a path from point a to point b corresponded to the least action principle. From what I remember, this approach really showed the close relationship between statistical, classical, and quantum mechanics, although I also remember never quite grokking the whole picture. Does this ring a bell for anyone? Does anyone know if this approach is written up anywhere?]]></description>

I imagine POMDP models either 1) need to be generalized to allow the agent to update its policies as time goes on, based on new data, or 2) need to be able to handle enough contingencies that any change in conditions is simply treated as another observation.   

I hope you get what I mean.  In case 1) we have actual &lt;i&gt;learning&lt;/i&gt; with the passage of time as we run the model, while in case 2) all the learning must occur before we start running the model; the model needs to be sufficiently well-prepared to be already familiar with all situations it comes across.   

Clearly approach 1) is more ambitious and more interesting.  I wonder what various systems like self-driving cars actually do!  Does one of Google&#039;s cars actually learn as it drives, for example learn more about the probability that another car will cut in front of it as it drives along a particular highway you use to go do work, perhaps in a way that depends on the time of day?  This could be good, but it&#039;s probably harder to get right.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s an interesting paper on information seeking, which alludes to some of the topics mentioned here...so I can&#039;t wait to watch the talk! How we handle information, obviously, impacts hugely how we interact with our environment + learn + seek out information. 

Here&#039;s the paper - http://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/abstract/S1364-6613(13)00205-2

For POMDP-type models, based on what I understand, how does it handle varying probabilities? In an actual environment - agent interaction situation, the probability of the event is not always constant. How does that affect the optimal strategy?]]></description>

Since they&#039;re describing it as a loop, I don&#039;t think they&#039;re claiming there&#039;s a best starting-point for that loop.  And they said &#039;action&#039;, not &#039;reaction&#039;.  However, what you say is interesting.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Actually, the colleagues in Bielefeld got the sequence exactly backwards: instead of sensation - perception - reaction, it should be action - sensation - perception.

Stimulus-response organization of behavior may occur, but I have yet to find a good example. Even reflexes, when  studied closely, only appear to be organized according to S-R concepts. If such S-R organization exists, then it is a highly derived trait and a rather rare exception.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was surprised that there was so little about vision at this workshop (going by the titles). Vision is the most information-rich sense that we have, and there are clearly informational constraints. We have 100 million photoreceptive cells per retina, but only one million fibres in an optic nerve. One third of the brain is devoted to vision. And there is evidence from change blindness (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_blindness) that we don&#039;t remember much about what we just saw, even 100ms later. This seems a much better testing ground for Tishby&#039;s theory than sleeping cats and mice swimming in milk.

The book Active Vision by John M Findlay and Iain D Gilchrist, 2003, makes a strong case for vision being an active process rather than a passive one. Especially important are eye movements, which depend on what you&#039;re trying to do, and what you&#039;ve seen (and remembered) so far. Each saccade, you change what you see. The saccades even give you discrete time steps, more or less.]]></description>
