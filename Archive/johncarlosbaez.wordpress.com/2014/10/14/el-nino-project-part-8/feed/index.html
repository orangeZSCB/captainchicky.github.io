					<description><![CDATA[It seem a graph with a discrete temporal evolution: there are some edge with some spatial nodes ( the grid or graph) and some edges with the same graph in different times.
It seem a common idea in experimental science, that is if the graph contain some edge with a great value (correlation), then it is possible a function that connect some past nodes and it is possible the prediction of an event; so that a study of the weights is enough to guess the domain of the function (that is used in the prediction), if there are different variables in each node suggested by experts.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very interesting, thanks.  Just eyeballing the two graphs, it is tempting to guess that in general, the avg link strengths drop to some minimal baseline value of around 3.5 at about 3k Km separation, with the Zone 9 height isobars being the anomalies.  I wonder how tau varies with separation (I know, I should go look:-)]]></description>
