					<description><![CDATA[Hmm, does the plotted temperature anomalies include the effect of methane feedback?

I read &quot;Limiting the warming caused by anthropogenic CO2 emissions alone&quot; in the Summary for Policymakers excerpt but then “when accounting for non-CO2 forcings as in RCP2.6”.

Well, as I’m typing this comment, I Googled for the answer and here it is: 

no, “The RCPs are projected from CO2 alone - they do not include the other GHGs”

http://www.climateemergencyinstitute.com/ipcc_ar5.html

So… it restricts even more our carbon budget.  +2C is a dream.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The concluding paragraphs argue that even abundant renewable energy won&#039;t stop us from burning all the fossil fuels we can find. It&#039;s hard to avoid the implication that geoengineering must be part of the solution. The almost-final IPCC WG3 report on mitigation covers sequestering and afforestation a little, but from my light reading doesn&#039;t emphasize it. Are there any realistic options on a scale that would help? Are any climate models up to the task of evaluating geoengineering options?]]></description>

I was quickly digging through the amendments (couldnt find the final version)

&lt;a href=&quot;http://webserver1.lsb.state.ok.us/cf_pdf/2013-14%20ENR/SB/SB1456%20ENR.PDF&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;there&lt;/a&gt; a socalled &quot;distributed generation&quot; is defined as

a) 
a device that provides electric energy that is
owned, operated, leased
or otherwise utilized by the customer

b)
is interconnected to and operates in parallel with the
retail electric supplier&#039;s grid and is in compliance
with the standards established by the retail electric
supplier

So this sounds as the charge is only for the grid connected.
and the charge is not only for solar.
but retail seems to be excluded:

e)
does not include generators operated and controlled by
a retail electric supplier,]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
So again: does one have to pay if one is completely disconnected yes or no?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weather.com/news/science/environment/oklahoma-alternative-energy-taxes-20140423&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Anyone living in Oklahoma planning to power their home using a rooftop solar panel will soon be charged a fee for the right to do that while still being connected to the local power grid.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Now, reading this as a mathematician, I can&#039;t conclude anything about what happens if I&#039;m &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; connected to the local power grid.  But reading it as an ordinary person, I&#039;m 99% sure they mean you&#039;re not taxed if you&#039;re not connected to the local power grid.  And that&#039;s good enough for me.

If you want more information, you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oklegislature.gov/BillInfo.aspx?Bill=SB1456&#038;Session=1400&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;read the law&lt;/a&gt;.  I know you said you don&#039;t want to.  I don&#039;t want to either.   ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2014/04/22/what-does-the-new-ipcc-report-say-about-climate-change-part-8/#comment-41001&quot;&gt;streamfortyseven&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;They both say the same thing, presumably if someone is a customer of an electric utility, their power system is tied into the grid&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This &quot;Presumably&quot; is what I wanted to turn into a more definite form.

So again: does one have to pay if one is completely disconnected yes or no?

I should point out that I am not interested enough in Oklahoma&#039;s tariffs that I would start to go through Oklahomas legal texts (if those are available at all). It seems there are similar things going on in Germany and I get already goose flesh if I think that I might need to go through the corresponding legal regulations. So somehow I can understand that the Oklahoma journalists where also hesitating to do so and most customers won&#039;t disconnect anyways....at least not if the tariffs are not getting too bad.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Why don’t they just disconnect, and store the power, or generate less? &lt;/blockquote&gt;

One could do this if one produces enough electricity, i.e. equal or more than needed. I suppose that the current stage of tariffs it would though probably be more costly for the ones who disconnect now, because they have to fund first extra storage solutions (like electric cars, batteries, shredders in farming etc.) If intermittent power generation gets more the grid will in the near future also need to pay more for better storage solutions but this independency of customers would be for the grid less good (in terms of energy generation), because the grid would loose the &quot;excessive&quot; electric energy which had been previously fed in. 

Concerning the price: Usually the &quot;grid storage&quot; price is implicitly somewhat contained in the feed-in price. That is if I have an extremely inflexible form of power like for example from a nuclear power plant which one can&#039;t ramp up as fast as like say a gas plant then one can&#039;t for example get the presumably high prices (??) of peak power a.s.o. So the feed-in tariffs are probably calculated with respect to average solar peak hour currency prices plus possibly some political incentive or so?]]></description>

They both say the same thing, presumably if someone is a customer of an electric utility, their power system is tied into the grid - i.e. has a physical connection to it. Now, in your first example you state something not in evidence: &quot;it does sound as if you need to pay even if you don’t use it.&quot; If they&#039;re connected to the electric utility, while they may be pushing power on to the grid at some times, at others they may be using grid power. If they&#039;re always pushing power onto the grid, what&#039;s the point of that? Why don&#039;t they just disconnect, and store the power, or generate less? That&#039;s the solution here, I think. Of course, at least in the US, the government is controlled by the large corporations which use it to maximize their profits. The only real solution to that is to get rid of as much of the government as you can possibly manage to do.]]></description>

@streamfortyseven

Unfortunately I couldn&#039;t figure out from the article you linked to whether you would need to pay that charge, even if you don&#039;t sell anything back to the grid or not.

Here in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://stateimpact.npr.org/oklahoma/2014/04/21/solar-and-wind-surcharge-bill-passes-legislature-awaits-governors-signature/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;April 21st&lt;/a&gt; article it does sound as if you need to pay even if you don&#039;t use it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A legislative measure that would allow electricity utilities to charge higher rates to customers who generate electricity with small solar installations or wind turbines has passed an Oklahoma House committee and now awaits Gov. Mary Fallin’s signature.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here it sounds as if no:

&lt;a href=&quot;http://stateimpact.npr.org/oklahoma/2014/04/01/why-small-solar-and-wind-energy-generators-are-worried-about-surcharge-legislation/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;April 1st&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The utilities say small electricity generators need to pay to use the electric grid itself.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But if no, why are the grid costs not included in the selling price?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very well put. Thank you for the explanation,

The thing is, it won&#039;t even help if people virtuously try to use less energy (cutting down demand); if they do, the prices will marginally drop and others will consume more; the efficiency of the market will be our undoing.

So the only two possible solutions appear to be to distort the market so that extraction is uneconomic (get everyone to sign onto a carbon tax or the like), or to come up with energy sources which are cheap enough to make it uneconomic to dig up the carbon.

It&#039;s quite a pickle. Every problem we have is generally solved by acquiring and using more resources. But what happens when that mechanism is precisely what will doom us?]]></description>
