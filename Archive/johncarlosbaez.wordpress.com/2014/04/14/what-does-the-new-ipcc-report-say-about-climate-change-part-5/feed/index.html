I can&#039;t answer your question, but wish I knew more about these issues, so thanks for the references.  

My own interest comes in part from trying to understand the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-temperature feedback loop that seems to be important for understanding the Earth&#039;s glacial cycle.  It&#039;s obvious how higher atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations increase temperature: the greenhouse effect.  But it seems that perhaps higher temperatures also increase atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, creating a feedback loop that amplifies the rather small Milankovitch cycles.  And according to Didier Paillard this is not fully understood.  The obvious mechanism---warmer liquids can hold less dissolved gas---seems to be insufficient.  Or so he said.

The interactions between carbonic acid, carbonate ions and bicarbonate ions are discussed here:

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Ocean+acidification#Details&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ocean acidification: details&lt;/a&gt;, Azimuth Library.

Let me quote:

Here is a plot showing the concentration of various ions as a function of pH:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Carbonate_system_of_seawater.svg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
&lt;img border=&quot;none&quot; src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Carbonate_system_of_seawater.svg/500px-Carbonate_system_of_seawater.svg.png&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The key processes involved are these.  Without carbon dioxide, these processes are continually occurring in water:

H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &#8596; OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; 

 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; &#8596;  H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

In the first process, a hydrogen nucleus H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, with one unit of positive charge, gets removed from one of the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecules, leaving behind the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxide&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;hydroxide&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ion OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; and a positively charge proton H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.  In the second, this H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; gets re-attached to the other H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecule, which thereby becomes a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydronium&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;hydronium&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ion, H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.  As the diagrams indicate, for each of these reactions, a reverse reaction is also present

With carbon dioxide present, these reactions are also important:

CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &#8596; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &#8596; H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; 

HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &#8596; H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;

The first reaction is the formation of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonic_acid&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;carbonic acid&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; from water and carbon dioxide.  The next reaction is the splitting of carbonic acid into a hydrogen ion and a negatively charged &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicarbonate&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;bicarbonate ion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;.  In the third reaction, the bicarbonate ion further ionizes into an H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and a doubly negative &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonate&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;carbonate ion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;.   

To see how these reactions lead to the graph above, see:

Very interesting. Are proper incentives in place to encourage investment in such things if they would be good? For example, uniformly applied appropriate taxes on emissions (and negative taxes on mitigations) would be ideal, but don&#039;t exist; but maybe some less ideal approximation (like some form of &quot;carbon pollution credits&quot; for mitigations, broadly defined) could realistically exist soon?]]></description>

yes looks like a interesting method. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&#060;300 kJ/mol of CO2 captured 
On a first glance it looks indeed considerable &quot;efficient&quot; like when compared to the removal of &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2013/03/07/post-combustion-co2-capture-to-mitigate-climate-change-separation-costs-energy/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;CO2 from air.&lt;/a&gt;
It would be interesting to know in that context how much usuable energy per Mol is on average produced per CO2 production, here are some first &lt;a href=&quot;https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090502130149AAUe5qy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;calculations&lt;/a&gt;.

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2014/04/14/what-does-the-new-ipcc-report-say-about-climate-change-part-5/#comment-40340&quot;&gt;Bruce Smith&lt;/a&gt;.

I&#039;ve heard someone argue that removing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from water is much more efficient than removing it from the air.   I&#039;d be interested to know more about if this is true, and if so, why.  Could it simply be because water in equilibrium with air holds much more CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per cubic centimeter than the air?  Or is it also because lots of chemical reactions work better in water?

Here is something relevant:

&#8226; April Flowers, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/1112859154/co2-removal-technique-offeset-ocean-acidification-052913/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;New CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; removal technique produces green fuel, offsets ocean acidification&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Redorbit&lt;/i&gt;, 29 May 2013.

and the original paper:

&#8226; Greg H. Raua,    Susan A. Carroll,    William L. Bourcier,   Michael J. Singleton, Megan M. Smith, and Roger D. Aines, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/110/25/10095.full?sid=36beb003-780d-4586-9f37-c0efeb254440&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Direct electrolytic dissolution of silicate minerals for air CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mitigation and carbon-negative H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;110&lt;/b&gt; (2013), 10095–10100.

Looks intriguing!  Obviously you can&#039;t make more energy this way than you put in, but still, they claim:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Using nongrid or nonpeak renewable electricity, optimized systems at large scale might allow relatively high-capacity, energy-efficient (&#060;300 kJ/mol of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; captured), and inexpensive (&#060;$100 per tonne of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mitigated) removal of excess air CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with production of carbon-negative H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

<p>I&#8217;ve heard someone argue that removing CO<sub>2</sub> from water is much more efficient than removing it from the air.   I&#8217;d be interested to know more about if this is true, and if so, why.  Could it simply be because water in equilibrium with air holds much more CO<sub>2</sub> per cubic centimeter than the air?  Or is it also because lots of chemical reactions work better in water?</p>
<p>Here is something relevant:</p>
<p>&bull; April Flowers, <a href="http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/1112859154/co2-removal-technique-offeset-ocean-acidification-052913/" rel="nofollow">New CO<sub>2</sub> removal technique produces green fuel, offsets ocean acidification</a>, <i>Redorbit</i>, 29 May 2013.</p>
<p>and the original paper:</p>
<p>&bull; Greg H. Raua,    Susan A. Carroll,    William L. Bourcier,   Michael J. Singleton, Megan M. Smith, and Roger D. Aines, <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/110/25/10095.full?sid=36beb003-780d-4586-9f37-c0efeb254440" rel="nofollow">Direct electrolytic dissolution of silicate minerals for air CO<sub>2</sub> mitigation and carbon-negative H<sub>2</sub> production</a>, <i>Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci.</i> <b>110</b> (2013), 10095–10100.</p>
<p>Looks intriguing!  Obviously you can&#8217;t make more energy this way than you put in, but still, they claim:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Using nongrid or nonpeak renewable electricity, optimized systems at large scale might allow relatively high-capacity, energy-efficient (&lt;300 kJ/mol of CO<sub>2</sub> captured), and inexpensive (&lt;$100 per tonne of CO<sub>2</sub> mitigated) removal of excess air CO<sub>2</sub> with production of carbon-negative H<sub>2</sub>.
