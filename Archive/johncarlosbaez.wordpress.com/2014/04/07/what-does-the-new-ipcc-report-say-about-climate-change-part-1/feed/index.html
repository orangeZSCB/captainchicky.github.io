&lt;blockquote&gt;
Climate change poses another significant challenge for the United States and the world at large.  As greenhouse gas emissions increase, sea levels are rising, average global temperatures are increasing, and severe weather patterns are accelerating. These changes, coupled with other global dynamics, including growing, urbanizing, more affluent populations, and substantial economic growth in India, China, Brazil, and other nations, will devastate homes, land, and infrastructure. Climate change may exacerbate water scarcity and lead to sharp increases in food costs. The pressures caused by climate change will influence resource competition while placing additional burdens on economies, societies, and governance institutions around the world. These effects are threat multipliers that will aggravate stressors abroad such as poverty, environmental degradation, political instability, and social tensions--conditions that can enable terrorist activity and other forms of violence.

It may not be what you&#039;re asking about, but there&#039;s plenty of overlap between military preparedness and preparing for climate change.  DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, had a &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.sciencemag.org/2009/03/darpa-explore-geoengineering&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;meeting in 2009&lt;/a&gt; to explore geoengineering ideas.  The CIA opened &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cia.gov/news-information/press-releases-statements/center-on-climate-change-and-national-security.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Center on Climate Change and National Security&lt;/a&gt; in September 2009.  It was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newsmax.com/US/cia-global-warming-agency/2012/11/21/id/465052/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;closed in November 2012&lt;/a&gt;, supposedly due to budgetary constraints... but perhaps actually because it had become a lightning-rod for criticism from Republican senators.  When it was closed, a CIA spokesman said &quot;This work is now performed by a dedicated team in an office that looks at a variety of economic and energy security issues affecting the United States.&quot;  I think the CIA is not so stupid as to quit paying attention to these issues.

There&#039;s also the &lt;a href=&quot;http://climateandsecurity.org/about/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Center for Climate and Security&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Center for Climate and Security (CCS), a nonprofit “think and action tank” with a distinguished Advisory Board of senior retired military leaders and security professionals, envisions a climate-resilient world. This is a world which recognizes that climate change risks are unprecedented in human history, and does not wait for absolute certainty before acting to mitigate and adapt to those risks. To further this goal, CCS facilitates policy development processes and dialogues, provides analysis, conducts research, and acts as a resource hub in the climate and security field.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

We&#039;re discussing the WG1 report---the &#039;physical science basis&#039; report.  This is not the one that talks about the costs of global warming: that&#039;s the WG2 report.  So for the answer to your question, read this:

&#8226;  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg2/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

or for starters:

&#8226;  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ipcc-wg2.gov/AR5/images/uploads/IPCC_WG2AR5_SPM_Approved.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability: Summary for Policymakers&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

I&#039;m hoping to get someone to post an article about this report here; that would be better than having someone write an article-sized reply to your comment.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;To stay below 2°C of warming&quot;. In the last 100 years, CO2 levels have increased from 280ppm to over 380ppm, which is alleged to be completely responsible for the 1.2°C rise in temperatures we have experienced in that same time frame. Yet the world didn&#039;t come to an end. In fact, no one noticed global warming was occurring until about 25 years or so ago. So what logic/evidence is there that that an additional 0.8°C increase in temperature is something to worry about, if it should happen in the next 50 years?]]></description>

No doubt there is some action by governments but there&#039;s a feeling here that seems on track, and maybe it would help to clarify it. Is there a set of noncontroversial statements that might help? My attempt: First, no government is free of corruption no matter how many, or all, of the people under a particular governance can be fooled part, or all, of the time. Likewise a clear path to the power that corrupts seems to be generating strong emotions in those who can be fooled into providing the desired political support. Which emotion seems basically to emerge from a proposition expressed in many ways, all basically equivalent to &quot;Believing is necessary and sufficient for knowing.&quot; While on the other hand, even with the technical difficulties in the words &quot;necessary&quot; and &quot;sufficient,&quot; most of us here would agree that &quot;knowing necessarily means believing,&quot; but &quot;believing does not necessarily mean knowing.&quot; Example: Galileo encountered strong emotion when he said the Earth moves around the sun. Today it would be impossible to generate that level of emotion because most of us Know that the Earth moves around the Sun. We are at peace with that because now we Know. It was Believing that generated all the strong emotion (including the belief that Believing means Knowing). Granted, on a different blog all of this might be controversial but I don&#039;t expect it to be controversial here.

To what extent is governmental corruption, and misperception of governmental corruption by the governed, preventing governmental action on climate change? If the political enabler of the corrupted power is &quot;Believing is necessary and sufficient for Knowing&quot; it would be logical that there are powers in the world opposing the correction of this proposition in the minds of people. As a consequence, there may be a feeling that understanding how corruption prevents action on climate change would, unjustly, be of minimal interest to governments. On the question of corruption and climate change, how many scientific studies are being funded?]]></description>

With very high confidence, the current rates of CO2, CH4 and N2O rise in atmospheric concentrations and the associated radiative forcing are unprecedented with respect to the highest resolution ice core records of the last 22,000 years&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;medium confidence that the rate of change of the observed greenhouse gas rise is also unprecedented compared with the lower resolution records of the past 800,000 years.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So, if we want to discuss this, we should consider rates of warming: the current ones, and those observed in ice cores.]]></description>
