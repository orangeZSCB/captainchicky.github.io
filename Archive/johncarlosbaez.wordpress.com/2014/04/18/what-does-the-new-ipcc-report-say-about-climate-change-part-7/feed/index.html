I think the more interesting question is not so much what we might mean by &#039;fucked&#039;, but what we mean by &#039;we&#039;. The impacts of climate change will be disproportionately suffered by the poor, especially those living in equatorial regions. I suspect that a lot of the variability in people&#039;s responses to the science of climate change can be explained by a difference in their ethical thinking. When people think the &#039;we&#039; doesn&#039;t include them, they tend to be much more blasé in their responses to climate change.]]></description>

I don&#039;t think we disagree very much---perhaps we disagree about nuances in the meaning of &quot;fucked&quot;.  I believe that the future depends heavily on our actions now and that being paralyzed by gloom is just silly.  I believe that, realistically, we are headed for bad times.  But I believe that there are many &lt;i&gt;degrees&lt;/i&gt; of bad times---from slightly bad to really bad to extremely bad---and that, realistically, we have the ability to make a difference.]]></description>

We&#039;re most definitely *not* fucked. We understand the physical science and the policy implications very well. We&#039;ve also discovered all this at a remarkable time for the human species - we have all the technology we need to solve the problem, and we have a remarkable communications infrastructure (the internet!) to get this information to people who need it.

The only real question is whether we can overcome our greed and our petty squabbles, and concentrate on building the clean energy infrastructure needed for a carbon neutral society. There&#039;s still time to achieve this, but we won&#039;t manage it if we sit there and say &quot;we&#039;re fucked&quot;. That&#039;s nothing more than a self-fulfilling prophecy.]]></description>

Two main reasons:

1) A lot of people don&#039;t believe the planet and humans are fucked; it&#039;s important to show people the evidence.

2) There are many degrees of being fucked.  Even if a disaster may be unavoidable, we can lessen the magnitude of the disaster if we take action.]]></description>

Sobering degree of global ambition needed to keep warming below 2 degrees Celsius. This is why I am quite pessimistic regarding natural gas as a “bridge fuel”.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Indeed!   And that&#039;s not going to happen without government intervention at a level that seems politically unlikely.  

It&#039;s not just natural gas as a bridge fuel that we should be pessimistic about: it&#039;s the whole idea that we&#039;ll meet the deadline to stay below 2 degrees Celsisus.  One starts wishing that the climate skeptics were right.  If the IPCC were dramatically overestimating the rate future global warming, or overestimating the effects of this warming... &lt;i&gt;then we might have enough time to stop global warming before it&#039;s a disaster.&lt;/i&gt;  

In other words: climate skeptics should be more willing to take action than the rest of us, because if their worldview is approximately right it&#039;s a problem we still have time to solve if we hurry up and work hard!  

However, it seems the equilibrium worldview for skeptics is one where the problem is so small we can ignore it completely... except for the ever-pressing need to convince everyone &lt;i&gt;else&lt;/i&gt; that they should ignore it too.]]></description>
