Thanks Steve. Yup I understood the axis scaling.  OK I marked up my flat screen more carefully and got 0.6 C vs 0.3, for a difference of 0.3 deg C.   Which doesn&#039;t seem to justify &quot;[not] anywhere near&quot; given how much this stat has fluctuated historically on a timescale of centuries.

The &#039;last million years&#039; observation, on the other hand, really got my attention.]]></description>

You&#039;re misreading the graph. Every minor checkmark on the x axis is fifty years. So &quot;today&#039;s value&quot; is pretty much zero on the temperature graph. And every minor checkmark on the y axis is 0.5degC. RCP2.6 peaks at about 1C warmer than today, and ends up about half a degree warmer. Both these temperatures are warmer than any time in the last million years.]]></description>

I assume the scenarios don&#039;t allow the CO2 to fall after 2200 is order to find out what the equilibrium climate sensitivity for that level of CO2 forcing is.  As RCP2.6 demonstrates before the year 2200, this statement is not quite as true as the graphs seem to indicate:

&quot;The problem is that a significant fraction of our greenhouse gas emissions stay in the atmosphere for thousands of years, so even if we stop emitting them altogether, they hang around, contributing to more warming.&quot;

The CO2 levels get frozen after 2200 for RCP2.6 as well.

What doesn&#039;t show up in this graph or the author&#039;s assessments is that even just the correlated errors are several times the size of the energy imbalance that is being attributed and projected.  That is why they don&#039;t put uncertainty bars on the model projections.]]></description>

I don&#039;t know much about relative costs, but I have seen interesting research on the relative impacts. The studies show that reducing CH4 emissions will affect the peak warming, while reducing CO2 emissions will affect the long term temperature change. In the longer term, the distinction doesn&#039;t matter much, because CH4 breaks down in the atmosphere into CO2 and water.]]></description>

Yes, there&#039;s lots of work going on for this. Google for the phrase &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.ca/search?q=Direct+air+capture+of+co2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&quot;Direct Air capture of CO2&quot;&lt;/a&gt; for some examples. However, I doubt this technology will do much more than buy us a little time. The problem is that as long as our CO2 emissions keep rising, our deployment of this technology would also have to keep growing to keep up. It&#039;s a kind of arms race that will be hard to win. Much better to tackle the underlying cause. 

The other problem is economics. We use fossil fuels because they are the cheapest source of energy, although the prices are rising steadily as we use up the easier sources. Once you add in the growing cost of the extra infrastructure needed for carbon capture and storage, fossil fuels rapidly become uncompetitive in price. Which means that either we&#039;ll continue to use them without CCS, and ignore the consequences, or we&#039;ll switch to clean energy. It&#039;s hard to imagine a future in which fossil fuels with CCS become the dominant energy source.

In the longer term, some future generation might invent a technology to undo what we&#039;re currently doing to the atmosphere. But I fear they&#039;ll be too busy just trying to survive on a devastated planet.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2014/04/10/what-does-the-new-ipcc-report-say-about-climate-change-part-3/#comment-40124&quot;&gt;Martin Lewitt&lt;/a&gt;.

I don&#039;t really buy the argument that this might mislead. We&#039;re talking about projections of future change. The only possible error bar that can be offered on such projections is the range of model results for different models, because other aspects of uncertainly (e.g. structural uncertainty in the models) cannot be reduced to a single value. But it&#039;s not true to claim that these uncertainties remain unexamined by the IPCC (or more specifically, by the model inter-comparison projects that provide inputs to the IPCC). The full set of model experiments in the CMIP5 contain many sets that are specifically designed to probe the sensitivity of models to different assumptions. The results from this analysis can&#039;t provide a simple error bar on model projections, but they show up in the IPCC report in terms of expert judgement of confidence in the projections. 

So, the graph represents our best understanding of the long term temperature changes as a result of elevated GHG levels. The models might be wrong in either direction in terms of the magnitude of the temperature anomalies. But the overall shape of the curve is almost certainly correct, and that&#039;s the point I want to get across in this post.

For more detail on how graphs such as these were generated, take a look at the work of Solomon et al. E.g.:
http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0812721106]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2014/04/10/what-does-the-new-ipcc-report-say-about-climate-change-part-3/#comment-40127&quot;&gt;Bruce Smith&lt;/a&gt;.

I can&#039;t really answer your question, but here&#039;s some data.

&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Greenhouse_Gas_by_Sector.png/646px-Greenhouse_Gas_by_Sector.png&quot; /&gt;

I don&#039;t know how to slow methane emission from melting permafrost, which may not be included in this chart.  But it&#039;s clear that cattle play a big role in methane emissions, so one question is: how much does it cost to persuade people to eat less beef?

Here&#039;s some stuff from the Azimuth Wiki section on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Carbon+footprint#Livestock&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Carbon footprint of livestock&lt;/a&gt;:

The greenhouse gas emissions produced by raising livestock greatly exceed their carbon footprint due to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, because cattle burp out a lot of methane, and there are also large N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O emissions---both these greenhouse gases have a much higher &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global-warming_potential#Values&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;global warming potential&lt;/a&gt; than CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, at least in the short run.  See:

&#8226;  Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a0701e/a0701e00.HTM&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Livestock&#039;s Long Shadow&lt;/a&gt;, Rome, 2006.  See especially &lt;a href=&quot;ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/010/a0701e/a0701e03.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Chapter 3: Livestock&#039;s role in climate change and air pollution&lt;/a&gt;.

Here are some figures from this report.  To place them in perspective, remember that human civilization emitted about &lt;b&gt;29.3 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide in 2007&lt;/b&gt;.

&#8226; Fossil fuel in manufacturing fertilizer may have emitted 41 megatonnes of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per year around 2006.  (This figure was computed by totalling figures estimated for 11 large countries.)

&#8226; On-farm fossil fuel use may have emitted 90 megatonnes of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per year.

&#8226; Livestock-related land use changes may have emitted 2.4 gigatonnes of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per year.

&#8226; Livestock-related releases from cultivated soils may have totalled 28 megatonnes of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per year.

&#8226; Releases from livestock-induced desertification of pastures may have totalled 100 megatonnes of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per year.

&#8226; Respiration by livestock is not a net source of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

&#8226; Methane released from enteric fermentation may total 86 megatonnes per year.

&#8226; Methane released from animal manure may total 18 megatonnes per year.

&#8226; CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from livestock processing may total several 10s of megatonnes per year.

&#8226; CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from transport of livestock products may total 0.8 megatonnes per year.

&#8226; Total CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from livestock activities are roughly &lt;b&gt;2.7 gigatonnes per year, or 0.16 gigatonnes per year not counting land use or change in land use&lt;/b&gt;.

<p>I can&#8217;t really answer your question, but here&#8217;s some data.</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Greenhouse_Gas_by_Sector.png/646px-Greenhouse_Gas_by_Sector.png" /></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how to slow methane emission from melting permafrost, which may not be included in this chart.  But it&#8217;s clear that cattle play a big role in methane emissions, so one question is: how much does it cost to persuade people to eat less beef?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s some stuff from the Azimuth Wiki section on <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Carbon+footprint#Livestock" rel="nofollow">Carbon footprint of livestock</a>:</p>
<p>The greenhouse gas emissions produced by raising livestock greatly exceed their carbon footprint due to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, because cattle burp out a lot of methane, and there are also large N<sub>2</sub>O emissions&#8212;both these greenhouse gases have a much higher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global-warming_potential#Values" rel="nofollow">global warming potential</a> than CO<sub>2</sub>, at least in the short run.  See:</p>
<p>&bull;  Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, <a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a0701e/a0701e00.HTM" rel="nofollow">Livestock&#8217;s Long Shadow</a>, Rome, 2006.  See especially <a href="ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/010/a0701e/a0701e03.pdf" rel="nofollow">Chapter 3: Livestock&#8217;s role in climate change and air pollution</a>.</p>
<p>Here are some figures from this report.  To place them in perspective, remember that human civilization emitted about <b>29.3 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide in 2007</b>.</p>
<p>&bull; Fossil fuel in manufacturing fertilizer may have emitted 41 megatonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> per year around 2006.  (This figure was computed by totalling figures estimated for 11 large countries.)</p>
<p>&bull; On-farm fossil fuel use may have emitted 90 megatonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> per year.</p>
<p>&bull; Livestock-related land use changes may have emitted 2.4 gigatonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> per year.</p>
<p>&bull; Livestock-related releases from cultivated soils may have totalled 28 megatonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> per year.</p>
<p>&bull; Releases from livestock-induced desertification of pastures may have totalled 100 megatonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> per year.</p>
<p>&bull; Respiration by livestock is not a net source of CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>&bull; Methane released from enteric fermentation may total 86 megatonnes per year.</p>
<p>&bull; Methane released from animal manure may total 18 megatonnes per year.</p>
<p>&bull; CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from livestock processing may total several 10s of megatonnes per year.</p>
<p>&bull; CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from transport of livestock products may total 0.8 megatonnes per year.</p>
<p>&bull; Total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from livestock activities are roughly <b>2.7 gigatonnes per year, or 0.16 gigatonnes per year not counting land use or change in land use</b>.  </p>
<p>&bull; Total CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from livestock activities are <b>2.2 gigatonnes CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent per year</b>.  </p>
<p>&bull; Total N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from livestock activities are also <b>2.2 gigatonnes CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent per year</b>. </p>
<p>&bull; The grand total of greenhouse gas emissions from livestock activities are roughly <b>7.1 gigatonnes CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent per year, or 4.6 not counting land use or change in land use</b>.</p>
<p>Again, compare that to <b>29.3 gigatonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted in 2007</b>.  It&#8217;s fairly substantial.</p>
