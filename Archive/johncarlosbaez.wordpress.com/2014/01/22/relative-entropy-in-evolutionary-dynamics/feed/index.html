					<description><![CDATA[While this kind of hard-coded inference dynamics and expectations might be fixed for individual agents of a class (i.e. species) within their lifetimes, these mappings can be optimised on a longer timescale over populations of agents by evolution. In fact, evolution might be seen as a very similar learning process, only on different spatial and temporal scales (c.f. the post of Marc Harper on John Baez’s Blog, and this talk by John Baez).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marcharper.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Marc Harper&lt;/a&gt; spoke about information in evolutionary game theory, and we have a nice video of that.

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, a bit too much of mathematical complexity in my opinion, but that&#039;s not my critic here. To me, &#039;Evolution&#039; has nothing to do with  &#039;Population Dynamic&#039; and &#039;fitness landscape&#039;, so a better title here would be:
&#039;Relative Entropy in Population Dynamics&#039;
 
I&#039;ve got to define the premises, the &#039;priors&#039;. I concede to Darwinism that the &#039;fittest&#039; will become the most numerous and successful and that elaborate mathematical descriptions of fitness landscape can describe Population Dynamic, but I don&#039;t agree that this model fits &#039;Evolution&#039;. 
So here I go:  Evolution represents a rise in Complexity (as in Kolmogorov algorithmic complexity) and/or algorithmic depth (as define by Charles Bennett) and is better explained within the conceptual frame of Information theory.
Species with similar level of complexity could be viewed as an horizontal differentiation, but since &#039;Complexity&#039; is not changed, they do not represent a case of &#039;Evolution&#039;, but a case of &#039;Speciation&#039;.
Both &#039;Population Dynamic&#039; and &#039;Speciation&#039; are interdependent and are probably a function of  fitness landscape among other things. 
But Evolution, as a rise in Complexity, is of different nature. 
An increase in complexity during an Evolutionary event might  even cause a fitness damage to their carrier, making them transiently mal-adapted or misfit, leading to small numbers in the population, in perfect agreement with Darwinism that the fittest must survive more.  
I&#039;ll go even further, what proof do we have that this &#039;Complexity related Evolution&#039; is driven by the fittest?
It&#039;s easy to understand that, in a given environment, Sub-optimal individuals have actually more reasons to try new strategies and explore more ecological niches than the Alphas. 
So somehow, true Evolution may have more to thank the misfits than the fittest: not exactly what Darwin said.
If it&#039;s not the fittest, what drives Evolution? well, some said its a Maxwell Demon. Evolution can be seen as a series of measurements  of the environment and Natural Selection act as a filter of the useful measurements. Whatever it is, this process produces an &#039;increased algorithmic complexity/depth&#039; but is not directly related to a successful population dynamic or speciation. 
That comes only after, once mutants with increased complexity appear, they have to adapt to survive and speciation has to take place rapidly, with the fittest individuals surviving as usual, but at this point, it&#039;s not Evolution anymore, just survival.]]></description>
