I thought a simple measure for simple forms of life: it is possible, now, a complete multicellular simulation of a C.Elegans, so that there is a program that represent the complete functions of this organism; the Kolmogorov complexity of the program can be a measure of the logical depth of the organism, and the dna complexity (that it is the biologic program) can be near to this value.
I thought that the programs, that Baez describes in The complexity barrier have some analogy with the differential equations: we use the relaxation method to solve them from some initial condition on a grid (like a Conway&#039;s game of life), the Kolmogorov complexity of the differential equation is low, and the logical depth of the results is high, and the final string (values on the grid points) of the result is high (high complexity of the calculus and high complexity of the solutions): I am thinking that the great complexity seem to be due to the boundary-values, and the initial values, so that a simple environment give simple solution.]]></description>

The picture and some of the discussion remind me that I&#039;d like to read carefully &quot;The Quark and the Jaguar&quot; by Murray Gell-Mann, in which IIRC he tries to speak clearly about complexity, information, and quantum mechanics.

(Devolving into gossip mode, it was among published comments appended to a separate Gell-Mann complexity essay that I encountered the following comment by Stuart Kauffman who - full disclosure - was also employed at the Santa Fe Institute:  &quot;Murray is enormously smart, sensible, and knowledgeable. He may know more things than any other single human being.&quot;  I&#039;d like to hear his wife&#039;s take on this.)]]></description>

Reading this very nice post again, I see that the &quot;depth of humans&quot; were put in a bit bigger picture, than what I suggested in the previous comment:

 &lt;blockquote&gt; In the case of humans, the process is 3.6 billion years of evolution and the depth can be read in the genome. The watch is deep as well, but much of its depth is acquired from the human genome relative to which it is not nearly so deep. &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

If one thinks of the internet in terms of a massively multiplayer prisoner&#039;s dilemma, the largest total norm occurs when everybody cooperates to share knowledge, including copyrighted information or proprietary information. John Baez is my hero for sharing his knowledge up to the limit of allowing others to preempt his own scientific publications. Although such behavior seems altruistic according to simple economic theory, it can even benefit sharers by raising the value of their information. Paradoxically at first glance, the more people there are with knowledge about a topic, the more that knowledge is worth because its value grows super-linearly with the number of interested people if that number is initially small.

One cryptocurrency, dogecoin, combines the idea of depth discussed in this guest post with the globalized gift economy. For example, dogecoin users &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.buzzfeed.com/tomphillips/internet-raises-over-30000-in-dogecoins-to-send&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;are sending the Jamaican bobsled team to the Olympics&lt;/a&gt; by donating $33k worth of Dogecoins in one day. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1whove/olympic_luge_contender_from_india_is_hoping_for_a/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;An Indian Luge athlete was given enough dogecoins&lt;/a&gt; ($6k worth) to travel to the Olympics within 3 hours of dogecoiners hearing about his plight. By being unselfish, dogecoin users have attracted new people and new investment to their coin far faster than any other cryptocurrency in history, including bitcoin. &lt;a href=&quot;http://coinmarketcap.com/mineable.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Dogecoin is now the 4th largest cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt;, despite being only 2 months old. By giving away coins to each other and to new users, dogecoin users increase the value of their remaining holdings by more than the previous value of what was donated! Dogecoin users with a high reputation for generosity and altruism are unable to empty their wallets because others donate them even more coins than they have given away. As an active dogecoin user, I am a true believer in its culture and I hope dogecoin will be able to scale up from its current market cap of $60 million into a size that can globally exchange the economics of debt and artificial scarcity of centrally controlled money for economics of cooperation and distributed control of money. I also wish that this blog had the capability to send dogecoin tips to users who make insightful posts, as much of reddit now does!]]></description>

By the statement &quot;tigers have great logical depth&quot;, do you mean that the DNA is a &quot;relatively&quot; simple object (playing the role of a short program), while building up the proteins etc are done through long and complicated chemical processes, pathways (which would be analogous to a long running time)?   

This is actually a quite interesting thought. It is very usual that popular books and articles on genetics compare two species at very different biological organization levels; and by noting that the length of the DNA is not too different for the two, conclude that their complexity might not differ that much either. However, the notion of logical depth may put that into a different perspective. (Btw, then also evolution could be looked at from a &quot;logical depth point of view&quot;.)]]></description>
