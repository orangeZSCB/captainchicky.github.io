					<p>Hi, I’m Curtis Faith. I’m very excited to be helping with the Azimuth Project.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I read John’s exhortation for blog readers to join in the discussion on the Azimuth Forum, so I decided to check it out. I was surprised at the amount of work that has been done in the last six months. I was inspired by the project’s goals and decided to commit to helping.</p>
<p>Since we need help, and hope that other blog readers might pitch in to help too, John and I thought it would be a good idea for me to explain a little about myself, why I think the Azimuth Project is so important, and how I think I can help.</p>
<p>I just turned 47 on Sunday. I am a first-time father with a 9-month old daughter. She is amazing. I don’t want her to grow up and wonder why our generation let things get so bad and I didn’t do anything to help make the world better.</p>
<p>I’m a real optimist by nature. But ignoring the very clear trends of the last 30 to 40 years is no longer an option. Our generation must stand up and do something about this.</p>
<p>A few years back I thought that politics might be the answer. I spent a lot of time learning the ins and outs of politics. My wife and I even followed the 2008 U.S. election and filmed the campaigns of Obama and Ron Paul in the process of learning. It is clear to me—having seen the way the last few years have unfolded—that political solutions will not avert the coming crisis.</p>
<p>In the last few years, my wife and I have lived in southeast Asia for 4 months, and in South America for a few years. I wanted to get to understand the world from outside the U.S. perspective. To get to know people in other countries as individuals, as humans. This has made it even more clear what the major problems are, and that the solutions won’t be implemented until a major crisis strikes.</p>
<p>So I’ve been working on learning relevant technology and science for the last few years as a backup plan. Trying to see where I might be able to help out in the most effective way possible. I have also spent a lot of time investigating the various other efforts working on the major global problems. None of them appear to me to be facing reality. In contrast, the Azimuth Project fits what I’ve seen with my own eyes.</p>
<p>But most of all, the reason that I’m excited about the Azimuth Project is that it has the loftiest of goals and the Earth needs saving. We’ve screwed it up and we’re running out of time.</p>
<p><strong>A bit about me</strong></p>
<p>I’m best known for something that started 27 years ago, in the fall of 1983, when I was just 19 years old.</p>
<p>I dropped out of college because I was bored and joined a small group of traders who later became famous in the trading world because of our subsequent success and how we learned to trade. Some of the lessons I learned in that group about managing risk and uncertainty are very relevant to the Azimuth Project goals for saving the world.</p>
<p>A famous Chicago trader, Richard Dennis, took out large ads in the New York Times, Barrons, and the Wall Street Journal announcing trainee positions. After only two weeks of training we were given money to trade and at the end of the first month of practice with a small account, I was given a $2 million account to trade. Over the next 4 plus years, I turned that $2 million into more than $33 million, more than doubling the money each year. Most of the other trainees were also successful and this story became legend in trading circles as the group made more than $100 million for Richard during the life of the program. Our group was known as the Turtles and I wrote a book about this experience, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/007148664X"><em>Way of the Turtle</em></a>, that became a bestseller in finance a few years back.</p>
<p>After Rich disbanded the Turtles, I got bored with trading. I was more interested in software and wanted to do something to make the world a better place. I started a few companies, built innovative software, tried to solve challenging problems and eventually found my way to Silicon Valley at the latter half of the Internet Boom.</p>
<p><strong>Chaos, and risk and uncertainty</strong></p>
<p>The sheer complexity of the issues and the scope of the problems that endanger the planet and life on it ensure that there will never be enough information to make a “correct” analysis. Except in the very broadest terms, we can’t know what the future will bring so we need to build plans that acknowledge that very real limitation.</p>
<p>We could pretend that we know more than is possible to know, or we can embrace the uncertainty and adapt to it. If we do this, we can concentrate on building flexibility and responsiveness along with an ability to assimilate and acquire an understanding of reality as it unfolds.</p>
<p>As a trader and entrepreneur, I learned about managing risk and uncertainty and how to develop flexible plans that will work when you can’t predict the future. Over time I came to see that other professionals who were forced to plan and make decisions under conditions of uncertainty used similar strategies.</p>
<p>But first, some background. While in Silicon Valley, I met a couple of guys who were forming a new hedge fund in the Virgin Islands, Simon Olsen and Bruce Tizes. In early 2001, it was obvious to most people that the Internet party was over in Silicon Valley. Pink slips were flying everywhere. So I thought it might be a good time to do something new for a few years.</p>
<p>I had often thought about getting back into trading so I could build up enough money to fund my own projects. I didn’t like the way that all the funding in software was focused on money. Most investors didn’t care about building cool software, and certainly not about doing positive things for the world. If those things came, they were secondary to profits. So for a while I thought it best to go make my own money. So I wouldn’t be restricted to only those strategies which optimized profits for investors.</p>
<p>So I decided to join Bruce and Simon in their hedge fund venture, and Bruce and I subsequently became good friends. Bruce had a very interesting background. He is one of the rare true polymaths that I’ve run into. He is incredibly bright, with a very flexible mind. He graduated high school at 15 years of age, college at 16, and medical school at 20. He later made a lot of money investing in real estate and trading stocks.</p>
<p>For most of the time since he had become a doctor, Bruce had been practicing emergency medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in Chicago. Mount Sinai is the inspiration for the television series E.R. that also takes place in Chicago and is a major destination for accident and gunshot victims in the downtown Chicago area.</p>
<p>So in various discussions over lunch or dinner over the few years we worked together, I came to learn a bit about the life of an emergency room doctor. Over time, Bruce showed me that there were similarities in how ER doctors and traders approached risk and uncertainty.</p>
<p>From my experience with software entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, I knew that they too handle risks and uncertainty in similar ways. It seemed like everyone who was forced to deal with uncertainty in the normal course of business followed similar general principles, and that these principles would be very useful even for those who didn’t learn them on the job.</p>
<p>Since my first book sold very well, the publisher was interested in getting me to write another book. I agreed to write one. But this time I wanted to write a book about these important principles for managing risk and uncertainty rather than a trading book.</p>
<p>This became my second book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Inside-Mind-Turtles-Worlds-Traders/dp/0071602437/"><em>Inside the Mind of the Turtles</em></a>. Unfortunately, against my wishes and better judgment, it was marketed as a trading book. The truth is that it is a much more general book written for times of chaos and uncertainty, even for the emergency room doctors for a planet in peril. It contains ideas that are very relevant to the Azimuth Project.</p>
<p>In my next post here, I’ll outline the Seven Rules for Risk I develop in the book and show how they are relevant for the Azimuth Project because of the tremendous uncertainty inherent in environmental and sustainability issues.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I urge you to join in and help with the Azimuth Project. Read some articles in the <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Azimuth+Library">Azimuth Library</a> and join the discussions on the related <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Azimuth+Forum">Azimuth Forum</a>.</p>
<p>The Azimuth Project is multidisciplinary so there are opportunities for all different kinds of people to help out. For example, I have been interested in low-energy transportation alternatives. So I plan on doing more research, adding to the Azimuth library of articles for advanced transportation, and finding some of the best experts to see if they will help on the Azimuth Project itself. I am also good at simplifying and explaining complicated problems. So I plan to take some of the more complicated sustainability issues and summarize them for non-experts. This will make it easier for people of diverse talents to grasp the full scope of the problems Azimuth is tackling.</p>
<p>I’ve spent much of the last 10 years trying to figure out how I can best help make the world a better place.</p>
<p>For me, the Azimuth Project is that answer. Come check it out.</p>

				<small>24 January, 2011</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>The world seems to be heading for tough times.  From a recent <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/22/science/earth/22kenya.html"><i>New York Times</i> article</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Over the next 100 years, many scientists predict, 20 percent to 30 percent of species could be lost if the temperature rises 3.6 degrees to 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit. If the most extreme warming predictions are realized, the loss could be over 50 percent, according to the United Nations climate change panel.
</p></blockquote>
<p>But when the going gets tough, the tough get going!  The idea of the Azimuth Project is create a place where scientists and engineers can meet and work together to help save the planet from global warming and other environmental threats.  The first step was to develop a procedure for collecting reliable information and explaining it clearly.  That means: not just a wiki, but a wiki with good procedures and a discussion forum to help us criticize and correct the articles.</p>
<p>Thanks to the technical wizardry of <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Andrew+Stacey">Andrew Stacey</a>, and a lot of sage advice and help from <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Eric+Forgy">Eric Forgy</a>, the <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/HomePage">wiki</a> and <a href="http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Mathforge/Azimuth/">forum</a> officially opened their doors about four months ago.</p>
<p>That seems like ages ago.  For months a small band of us worked hard to get things started.  With the beginning of the new year, we seem to be entering a phase transition: we&#8217;re getting a lot of new members.   So, it&#8217;s time to give you an update!</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot going on now.  If you&#8217;ve been reading this blogs and clicking some of the links, you&#8217;ve probably seen some of our pages on <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Sea+level+rise">sea level rise</a>, <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Coral+reef">coral reefs</a>, <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/ENSO">El Ni&ntilde;o</a>, <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Biochar">biochar</a>, <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Photovoltaic+solar+power">photovoltaic solar power</a>, <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Peak+oil">peak oil</a>, <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/EROEI">energy return on energy invested</a>, and dozens of other topics.  If you haven&#8217;t, check them out!</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s just the start of it.  If you haven&#8217;t been reading the <a href="http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Mathforge/Azimuth/">Azimuth Forum</a>, you probably don&#8217;t know most of what&#8217;s going on.  Let me tell you what we&#8217;re doing.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll also tell you some <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Things+to+do">things you can do to help</a>.</p>
<h4>Azimuth Project Pages</h4>
<p>By far the easiest thing is to go to any Azimuth Project page, think of some information or reference that it&#8217;s missing, and add it!   Go to the <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/HomePage">home page</a>, click on a category, find an interesting article in that category and give it a try.  Or, if you want to start a new page, do that.  We desperately need more help from people in the life sciences, to build up our collection of pages on biodiversity.</p>
<p>If you need help, start here:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/How+to+get+started">How to get started</a>.</p>
<h4>Plans of Action</h4>
<p>We&#8217;re working through various plans for dealing with peak oil, global warming, and various environmental problems.  You can see our progress here:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Plans+of+action">Plans of action</a>, Azimuth Project.</p>
<p>So far it goes like this.  First we write summaries of these plans.  Then I blog about them.  Then <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Frederik+De+Roo">Frederik De Roo</a> is distilling your criticisms and comments and adding them to the Azimuth Project.  The idea is to build up a thorough comparison of many different plans.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re the furthest along when it comes to Pacala and Socolow&#8217;s plan:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Stabilization+wedges">Stabilization wedges</a>, Azimuth Project.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t need to be an expert on any particular discipline to help here!  You just need to be able to read plans of action and write crisp precise summaries, as above.   We also need help <i>finding</i> the most important plans of action.</p>
<p>In addition to plans of action, we&#8217;re also summarizing various &#8216;reports&#8217;.  The idea is that a report presents facts, while a plan of action advocates a course of action.  See:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Reports">Reports</a>, Azimuth Project.</p>
<p>In practice the borderline between plans of action and reports is a bit fuzzy, but that&#8217;s okay.</p>
<h4>Plan C</h4>
<p>Analyzing plans of action is just the first step in a more ambitious project: we&#8217;d like to start formulating our own plans.  Our nickname for this project is <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Plan+C">Plan C</a>.</p>
<p>Why Plan C?  Many other plans, like Lester Brown&#8217;s <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Plan+B">Plan B</a>, are too optimistic.  They assume that most people will change their behavior in dramatic ways <i>before</i> problems become very serious.  We want a plan that works with actual humans.</p>
<p>In other words: while optimism is a crucial part of any successful endeavor, we also need plans that assume plausibly suboptimal behavior on the part of the human race.  It would be best if we did everything right in the first place.  It would be second best to catch problems before they get very bad &mdash; that&#8217;s the idea of Plan B.  But realistically, we&#8217;ll be lucky if we do the <i>third best</i> thing: muddle through when things get bad.</p>
<h4> Azimuth Code Project </h4>
<p>Some people on the Amazon Project, most notably <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Tim+van+Beek">Tim van Beek</a>, are writing software that illustrates ideas from climate physics and quantitative ecology.  Full-fledged climate models are big and tough to develop; it&#8217;s a lot easier to start with simple models, which are good for educational purposes.   I&#8217;m starting to use these in <i>This Week&#8217;s Finds</i>.</p>
<p>If you have a background in programming, we need your help!  We have people writing programs in R and Sage&#8230; but Tim is writing code in Java for a systematic effort he calls the <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Azimuth+code+project">Azimuth Code Project</a>.  The idea is that over time, the results will become a repository of open-source modelling software.  As a side effect, he&#8217;ll try to show that clean, simple, open-source, well-managed and up-to-date code handling is possible at a low cost &mdash; and he&#8217;ll explain how it can be done.</p>
<p>So far most of our software is connected to  <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/stochastic+differential+equations">stochastic differential equations</a>:</p>
<p>&bull; Software for investigating the Hopf bifurcation and its stochastic version: see <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/12/24/this-weeks-finds-week-308/">week308</a> of <i>This Week&#8217;s Finds</i>.</p>
<p>&bull; Software for studying predator-prey models, including stochastic versions: see the page on <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Quantitative+ecology">quantitative ecology</a>.  Ultimately it would be nice to have some software to simulate quite general <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Petri+net">stochastic Petri nets</a>.</p>
<p>&bull; Software for studying stochastic resonance: see the page on <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Stochastic+resonance">stochastic resonance</a>.  We need a lot more on this, leading up to software that takes publicly available data on <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Milankovitch+cycle">Milankovitch cycles</a> &mdash; cyclic changes in the Earth&#8217;s orbit &mdash; and uses it to make predictions of the glacial cycles.  It&#8217;s not clear how good these predictions will be &mdash; the graphs I&#8217;ve seen so far don&#8217;t look terribly convincing &mdash; but the Milankovitch cycle theory of the ice ages is pretty popular, so it&#8217;ll be fun to see.</p>
<p>&bull; We would like a program that simulates the <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Stochastic+delay+differential+equation">delayed action oscillator</a>, which is an interesting simple model for the  <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/ENSO#DelayedActionOscillator">El Ni&ntilde;o / Southern Oscillation</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Graham+Jones">Graham Jones</a> has proposed some more challenging projects:</p>
<p>&bull; An open source version of <a href="http://www.orioninnovations.co.uk/Fesa/downloads/FESAflyerAug2010.pdf">FESA</a>, the Future Energy Scenario Assessment.  FESA, put out by <a href="http://www.orioninnovations.co.uk">Orion Innovations</a>, is proprietary software that models energy systems scenarios, including meteorological data, economic analysis and technology performance.</p>
<p>&bull; An automated species-identification system. See the article <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v467/n7312/full/467154a.html">Time to automate identification</a> in the journal <i>Nature</i>. The authors say that taxonomists should work with specialists in pattern recognition, machine learning and artificial intelligence to increase accuracy and reduce drudgery.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/David+Tweed">David Tweed</a>, who is writing a lot of our pages on the economics of energy, has suggested some others:</p>
<p>&bull; Modeling advanced strategies for an electrical smart grid.</p>
<p>&bull; Modeling smartphone or website based car- or ride-sharing schemes.</p>
<p>&bull; Modeling supply routing systems for supermarkets that attempt to reduce their ecological footprint.</p>
<p>All these more challenging projects will only take off if we find some energetic people and get access to good data.</p>
<h4>This Week&#8217;s Finds</h4>
<p>I&#8217;m interviewing people for <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/twf.html">This Week&#8217;s Finds</a>: especially scientists who have switched from physics to environmental issues, and people with big ideas about how to save the planet.  The goal here is to attract people, especially students, into working on these subjects.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my progress so far:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.geosc.psu.edu/~nurban/">Nathan Urban</a> &mdash; climate change. Done.</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.jesus.ox.ac.uk/staff/palmer.php">Tim Palmer</a> &mdash; weather prediction.  Done.</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://yudkowsky.net/">Eliezer Yudkowsky</a> &mdash; friendly AI.  Interviewed.</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.soton.ac.uk/~doctom/talks/sustainability-barriers.pdf">Thomas Fischbacher</a> &mdash; sustainability.  Interviewed.</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.gregorybenford.com/">Gregory Benford</a> &mdash; geoengineering.  Underway.</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.ellerman.org/Davids-Stuff/AboutDavidEllerman.htm">David Ellerman</a> &#8211; helping people, economics.   Underway.</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://metamodern.com/">Eric Drexler</a> &mdash; nanotechnology.  Agreed to do it.</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://bioinfo.mbi.ucla.edu/leelab/">Chris Lee</a> &mdash; bioinformatics.  Agreed to do it.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a scientist or engineer doing interesting things on the topics we&#8217;re interested in at the Azimuth Project, and you&#8217;d like me to interview you, let me know!  Of course, your ego should be tough enough to handle it if I say no.</p>
<p>Alternatively: if you know somebody like this, and you&#8217;re good at interviewing people, this is another place you might help.   You could either send them to me, or interview them yourself!   I&#8217;m already trying to subcontract out one interview to a mathematician friend.</p>
<h4>Blog articles</h4>
<p>While I&#8217;ve been writing most of the articles on this blog so far, I don&#8217;t want it to stay that way.    If you want to write articles, let me know!  I might or might not agree&#8230; but if you read this blog, you know what I like, so you can guess ahead of time whether I&#8217;ll like your article or not.</p>
<p>In fact, the next two articles here will be written by <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Curtis+Faith">Curtis Faith</a>, a new member of the <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Azimuth+Forum">Azimuth Forum</a>.</p>
<h4>More</h4>
<p>There&#8217;s also a lot more you can do.  For suggestions, try:</p>

				<small>24 December, 2010</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>
Last week we met the El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation, or ENSO.  I like to explain things as I learn about them.  So, often I look back and find my explanations naive.  But this time it took less than a week!
</p>
<p>
What did it was reading this:</p>
<p>
&bull; J. D. Neelin, D. S. Battisti, A. C. Hirst <i>et al.</i>, <a href="http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/MET/Faculty/jff/1998_03%20ENSO%20theory.pdf">ENSO theory</a>, <i><a href="http://www.agu.org/journals/ABS/1998/97JC03424.shtml">J. Geophys. Res.</a></i> <b>103</b> (1998), 14261-14290.
</p>
<p>
I wouldn&#8217;t recommend this to the faint of heart.  It&#8217;s a bit terrifying.  It&#8217;s well-written, but it tells the long and tangled tale of how theories of the ENSO phenomenon evolved from 1969 to 1998 &mdash; a period that saw much progress, but did <i>not</i> end with a neat, clean understanding of this phenomenon.   It&#8217;s packed with hundreds of references, and sprinkled with somewhat intimidating remarks like:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
The Fourier-decomposed longitude and time dependence of these eigensolutions obey dispersion relations familiar to every physical oceanographer&#8230;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Nonetheless I found it fascinating &mdash; so, I&#8217;ll pick off one small idea and explain it now.</p>
<p>
As I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve heard, climate science involves some extremely complicated models: some of the most complex known to science.   But it also involves models of lesser complexity, like the &quot;box model&quot; explained by Nathan Urban in &quot;<a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week304.html">week304</a>&quot;.  And it also involves some extremely simple models that are designed to isolate some interesting phenomena and display them in their Platonic ideal form, stripped of all distractions.</p>
<p>
Because of their simplicity, these models are great for mathematicians to think about: we can even prove theorems about them!  And simplicity goes along with generality, so the simplest models of all tend to be applicable &mdash; in a rough way &mdash; not just to the Earth&#8217;s climate, but to a vast number of systems.  They are, one might say, <i>general possibilities of behavior</i>.

Of course, we can&#8217;t expect simple models to describe complicated real-world situations very accurately.  That&#8217;s not what they&#8217;re good for.  So, even calling them &quot;models&quot; could be a bit misleading.  It might be better to call them &quot;patterns&quot;: patterns that can help organize our thinking about complex systems.  </p>
<p>
There&#8217;s a nice mathematical theory of these patterns&#8230; indeed, several such theories.  But instead of taking a top-down approach, which gets a bit abstract, I&#8217;d rather tell you about some examples, which I can illustrate using pictures.  But I didn&#8217;t make these pictures.  They were created by <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Tim+van+Beek">Tim van Beek</a> as part of the Azimuth Code Project.  The <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Azimuth+code+project">Azimuth Code Project</a> is a way for programmers to help save the planet.  More about that later, at the end of this article.

As we saw last time, the ENSO cycle relies crucially on interactions between the ocean and atmosphere.  In some models, we can artificially adjust the strength of these interactions, and we find something interesting.  If we set the interaction strength to less than a certain amount, the Pacific Ocean will settle down to a stable equilibrium state.  But when we turn it up past that point, we instead see periodic oscillations!  Instead of a stable equilibrium state where nothing happens, we have a stable <i>cycle</i>.
</p>
<p>
This pattern, or at least one pattern of this sort, is called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopf_bifurcation">&quot;Hopf bifurcation&quot;</a>.  There are various differential equations that exhibit a Hopf bifurcation, but here&#8217;s my favorite:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7Bd+x%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D++-y+%2B+%5Cbeta++x+-+x+%28x%5E2+%2B+y%5E2%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;frac{d x}{d t} =  -y + &#92;beta  x - x (x^2 + y^2) " class="latex" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7Bd+y%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D++%5C%3B+x+%2B+%5Cbeta++y+-+y+%28x%5E2+%2B+y%5E2%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;frac{d y}{d t} =  &#92;; x + &#92;beta  y - y (x^2 + y^2) " class="latex" /></p>
<p>
Here <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y" class="latex" /> are functions of time, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="t" class="latex" />, so these equations describe a point moving around on the plane.  It&#8217;s easier to see what&#8217;s going on in polar coordinates:
</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7Bd+r%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D+%5Cbeta+r+-+r%5E3+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;frac{d r}{d t} = &#92;beta r - r^3 " class="latex" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7Bd+%5Ctheta%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D+1+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;frac{d &#92;theta}{d t} = 1 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>
The angle <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;theta" class="latex" /> goes around at a constant rate while the radius <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r" class="latex" /> does something more interesting.  When <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta+%5Cle+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta &#92;le 0" class="latex" />, you can see that any solution spirals in towards the origin!  Or, if it starts at the origin, it stays there.  So, we call the origin a &quot;stable equilibrium&quot;.
</p>
<p>
Here&#8217;s a typical solution for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta+%3D+-1%2F4&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta = -1/4" class="latex" />, drawn as a curve in the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x y" class="latex" /> plane.  As time passes, the solution spirals in towards the origin:

<img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/No_Limit_Circle_No_Noise.jpg" />
</div>
</p>
<p>
The equations are more interesting for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta+%3E+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta &gt; 0" class="latex" />.  Then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=dr%2Fdt+%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="dr/dt = 0" class="latex" /> whenever
</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta+r+-+r%5E3+%3D+0+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta r - r^3 = 0 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>
This has two solutions, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r+%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r = 0" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r+%3D+%5Csqrt%7B%5Cbeta%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r = &#92;sqrt{&#92;beta}" class="latex" />.   Since <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r+%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r = 0" class="latex" /> is a solution, the origin is still an equilibrium.  But now it&#8217;s not stable: if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r" class="latex" /> is between <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="0" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B%5Cbeta%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;sqrt{&#92;beta}" class="latex" />, we&#8217;ll have <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta+r+-+r%5E3+%3E+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta r - r^3 &gt; 0" class="latex" />, so our solution will spiral <i>out</i>, away from the origin and towards the circle <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r+%3D+%5Csqrt%7B%5Cbeta%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r = &#92;sqrt{&#92;beta}" class="latex" />.  So, we say the origin is an &quot;unstable equilibrium&quot;.  On the other hand, if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r" class="latex" /> starts out bigger than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B%5Cbeta%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;sqrt{&#92;beta}" class="latex" />, our solution will spiral in towards that circle.
</p>
<p>
Here&#8217;s a picture of two solutions for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta+%3D+1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta = 1" class="latex" />:

</div>
</p>
<p>
The red solution starts near the origin and spirals out towards the circle <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r+%3D+%5Csqrt%7B%5Cbeta%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r = &#92;sqrt{&#92;beta}" class="latex" />.  The green solution starts outside this circle and spirals in towards it, soon becoming indistinguishable from the circle itself.  So, this equation describes a system where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y" class="latex" /> quickly settle down to a periodic oscillating behavior.</p>
<p>
Since solutions that start anywhere near the circle <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r+%3D+%5Csqrt%7B%5Cbeta%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r = &#92;sqrt{&#92;beta}" class="latex" /> will keep going round and round getting closer to this circle, it&#8217;s called a &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit-cycle">stable limit cycle</a>&quot;.
</p>
<p>
This is what the Hopf bifurcation is all about!  We&#8217;ve got a dynamical system that depends on a parameter, and as we change this parameter, a stable fixed point become unstable, and a stable limit cycle forms around it.
</p>
<p>
This isn&#8217;t quite a mathematical definition yet, but it&#8217;s close enough for now.  If you want something a bit more precise, try:

&bull; Yuri A. Kuznetsov, <a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Andronov-Hopf_bifurcation">Andronov-Hopf bifurcation</a>, <i>Scholarpedia</i>, 2006.
</p>
<p>
Now, clearly the Hopf bifurcation idea is too simple for describing real-world weather cycles like the ENSO.  In the Hopf bifurcation, our system settles down into an orbit very close to the limit cycle, which is perfectly periodic.  The ENSO cycle is only <i>roughly</i> periodic:

The time between El Ni&ntilde;os varies between 3 and 7 years, averaging around 4 years.  There can also be two El Ni&ntilde;os without an intervening La Ni&ntilde;a, or vice versa.  One can try to explain this in various ways.
</p>
<p>
One very simple, general idea to add random noise to whatever differential equation we were using to model the ENSO cycle, obtaining a so-called <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Stochastic+differential+equation">stochastic differential equation</a>: a differential equation describing a <i>random</i> process.  Richard Kleeman discusses this idea in Tim Palmer&#8217;s book:</p>
<p>
&bull; Richard Kleeman, <a href="http://www.pims.math.ca/files/kleeman_6.pdf">Stochastic theories for the irregularity of ENSO</a>, in <i>Stochastic Physics and Climate Modelling</i>, eds. Tim Palmer and Paul Williams, Cambridge U. Press, Cambridge, 2010, pp. 248-265.
</p>
<p>
Kleeman mentions three general theories for the irregularity of the ENSO.  They all involve the idea of separating the weather into &quot;modes&quot; &mdash; roughly speaking, different ways that things can oscillate.  Some modes are slow and some are fast.  The ENSO cycle is defined by the behavior of certain slow modes, but of course these interact with the fast modes.  So, there are various options:
</p>
<ol>
<p><li>
Perhaps the relevant slow modes interact with each other in a chaotic way.
</li>
</p>
<p><li>
Perhaps the relevant slow modes interact with each other in a non-chaotic way, but also interact with chaotic fast modes, which inject noise into what would otherwise be simple periodic behavior.
</li>
</p>
<p><li>
Perhaps the relevant slow modes interact with each other in a chaotic way, and also interact in a significant way with chaotic fast modes.
</li>
</p>
</ol>
<p>
Kleeman reviews work on the first option but focuses on the second.  The third option is the most complicated, so the pessimist in me suspects that&#8217;s what&#8217;s really going on.  Still, it&#8217;s good to start by studying simple models!
</p>
<p>
How can we get a simple model that illustrates the second option?  Simple: take the model we just saw, and add some noise!  This idea is discussed in detail here:

</p>
<p>
This paper is not about the ENSO cycle, but another one, which is often nicknamed the <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Atlantic+multidecadal+oscillation">AMO</a>.  I would love to talk about it &mdash; but not now.  Let me just show you the equations for a Hopf bifurcation with noise:
</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7Bd+x%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D++-y+%2B+%5Cbeta++x+-+x+%28x%5E2+%2B+y%5E2%29+%2B+%5Clambda+%5Cfrac%7Bd+W_1%7D%7Bd+t%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;frac{d x}{d t} =  -y + &#92;beta  x - x (x^2 + y^2) + &#92;lambda &#92;frac{d W_1}{d t}" class="latex" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7Bd+y%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D++%5C%3B+x+%2B+%5Cbeta++y+-+y+%28x%5E2+%2B+y%5E2%29+%2B+%5Clambda+%5Cfrac%7Bd+W_2%7D%7Bd+t%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;frac{d y}{d t} =  &#92;; x + &#92;beta  y - y (x^2 + y^2) + &#92;lambda &#92;frac{d W_2}{d t}" class="latex" /></p>
<p>
They&#8217;re the same as before, but with some new extra terms at the end: that&#8217;s the noise.
</p>
<p>
This could easily get a bit technical, but I don&#8217;t want it to.  So, I&#8217;ll just say some buzzwords and let you click on the links if you want more detail.  <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W_1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="W_1" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W_2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="W_2" class="latex" /> are two independent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_process">Wiener processes</a>, so they describe <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion">Brownian motion</a> in the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y" class="latex" /> coordinates.  When we differentiate a Wiener process we get <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise">white noise</a>.  So, we&#8217;re adding some amount of white noise to the equations we had before, and the number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;lambda" class="latex" /> says precisely how much.  That means that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y" class="latex" /> are no longer specific functions of time: they&#8217;re <i>random</i> functions, also known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_process">stochastic processes</a>.
</p>
<p>
If this were a math course, I&#8217;d feel obliged to precisely define all the terms I just dropped on you.  But it&#8217;s not, so I&#8217;ll just show you some pictures!
</p>
<p>
If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta+%3D+1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta = 1" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda+%3D+0.1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;lambda = 0.1" class="latex" />, here are some typical solutions:</p>
<p><div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/Limit_Circle_Noise_01.jpg" />
</div>
</p>
<p>
They look similar to the solutions we saw before for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta+%3D+1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta = 1" class="latex" />, but now they have some random wiggles added on.
</p>
<p>
(You may be wondering what this picture really shows.  After all, I said the solutions were random functions of time, not specific functions.  But it&#8217;s tough to draw a &quot;random function&quot;.   So, to get one of the curves shown above, what Tim did is randomly choose a function according to some rule for computing probabilities, and draw that.)
</p>
<p>
If we turn up the noise, our solutions get more wiggly.  If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta+%3D+1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta = 1" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda+%3D+0.3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;lambda = 0.3" class="latex" />, they look like this:</p>
<p><div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/Limit_Circle_Noise_03.jpg" />
</div>
</p>
<p>
In these examples, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta+%3E+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta &gt; 0" class="latex" />, so we would have a limit cycle if there weren&#8217;t any noise &mdash; and you can see that even with noise, the solutions <i>approximately</i> tend towards the limit cycle.  So, we can use an equation of this sort to describe systems that oscillate, but in a somewhat random way.
</p>
<p>
But now comes the really interesting part!  Suppose <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta+%5Cle+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta &#92;le 0" class="latex" />.  Then we&#8217;ve seen that without noise, there&#8217;s no limit cycle: any solution quickly spirals in towards the origin.  But with noise, something a bit different happens.  If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta+%3D+-1%2F4&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta = -1/4" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda+%3D+0.1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;lambda = 0.1" class="latex" /> we get a picture like this:
</p>
<p><div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/No_Limit_Circle_Noise_01.jpg" />
</div>
</p>
<p>
We get irregular oscillations even though there&#8217;s no limit cycle!  Roughly speaking, the noise keeps knocking the solution away from the stable fixed point at <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%3D+y+%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x = y = 0" class="latex" />, so it keeps going round and round, but in an irregular way.  It may seem to be spiralling in, but if we waited a bit longer it would get kicked out again.

This is a lot easier to see if we plot just <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> as a function of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="t" class="latex" />.  Then we can run our solution for a longer time without the picture becoming a horrible mess:

</div>
</p>
<p>
If you compare this with the ENSO cycle, you&#8217;ll see they look roughly similar:</p>
<p><div align="center">
<a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/kessler/figures.html"><br />
<img border="none" width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/soi-1876-1998.gif" /><br />
</a>
</div>
</p>
<p>
That&#8217;s nice.  Of course it doesn&#8217;t prove that a model based on a Hopf bifurcation plus noise is &quot;right&quot; &mdash; indeed, we don&#8217;t really <i>have</i> a model until we&#8217;ve chosen variables for both <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y" class="latex" />.  But it suggests that a model of this sort could be worth studying.
</p>
<p>
If you want to see how the Hopf bifurcation plus noise is applied to climate cycles, I suggest starting with <a href="http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/366/1875/2543.full.pdf">the paper by Dijkstra, Frankcombe and von der Heydt</a>.  If you want to see it applied to the El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation, start with Section 6.3 of <a href="http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/MET/Faculty/jff/1998_03%20ENSO%20theory.pdf">the ENSO theory paper</a>, and then dig into the many references.  Here it seems a model with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta+%3E+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta &gt; 0" class="latex" /> may work best.  If so, noise is not required to keep the ENSO cycle going, but it makes the cycle irregular.
</p>
<p>
To a mathematician like me, what&#8217;s really interesting is how the addition of noise &quot;smooths out&quot; the Hopf bifurcation.  When there&#8217;s no noise, the qualitative behavior of solutions jumps drastically at <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta+%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta = 0" class="latex" />.  For <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta+%5Cle+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta &#92;le 0" class="latex" /> we have a stable equilibrium, while for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta+%3E+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta &gt; 0" class="latex" /> we have a stable limit cycle.  But in the presence of noise, we get irregular cycles not only for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta+%3E+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta &gt; 0" class="latex" /> but also <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta+%5Cle+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta &#92;le 0" class="latex" />.  This is not really surprising, but it suggests a bunch of questions.  Such as: what are some quantities we can use to describe the behavior of &quot;irregular cycles&quot;, and how do these quantities change as a function of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;lambda" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta" class="latex" />?
</p>
<p>
You&#8217;ll see some answers to this question in Dijkstra, Frankcombe and von der Heydt&#8217;s paper.  However, if you&#8217;re a mathematician, you&#8217;ll instantly think of dozens more questions &mdash; like, how can I <i>prove</i> what these guys are saying?
</p>
<p>
If you make any progress, let me know.  If you don&#8217;t know where to start, you might try the Dijkstra <i>et al.</i> paper, and then learn a bit about the Hopf bifurcation, stochastic processes, and stochastic differential equations:

Now, about the <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Azimuth+code+project">Azimuth Code Project</a>.  Tim van Beek started it just recently, but the <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/HomePage">Azimuth Project</a> seems to be attracting people who can program, so I have high hopes for it.  Tim wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
My main objectives to start the Azimuth Code Project were:</p>
<p>
&bull; to have a central repository for the code used for simulations or data analysis on the Azimuth Project,
</p>
<p>
&bull; to have an online free access repository and make all software open source, to enable anyone to use the software, for example to reproduce the results on the Azimuth Project.  Also to show by example that this can and should be done for every scientific publication.
</p>
<p>
Of less importance is:
</p>
<p>
&bull; to implement the software with an eye to software engineering principles.
</p>
<p>
This less important because the world of numerical high performance computing differs significantly from the rest of the software industry: it has special requirements and it is not clear at all which paradigms that are useful for the rest will turn out to be useful here. Nevertheless I&#8217;m confident that parts of the scientific community will profit from a closer interaction with software engineering.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
So, if you like programming, I hope you&#8217;ll <a href="http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Mathforge/Azimuth/comments.php?DiscussionID=262&amp;page=1#Item_5">chat with us</a> and consider joining in!  Our next projects involve limit cycles in predator-prey models, stochastic resonance in some theories of the ice ages, and delay differential equations in ENSO models.

				<small>27 October, 2010</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>The <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/HomePage">Azimuth Project</a> wiki has been up and running for exactly one month!  </p>
<p>We&#8217;ve built up a nice bunch of articles sketching some of the biggest environmental problems we face today &mdash; and some ideas for dealing with them.   I invite you to look these over and <i>improve them!</i>  It&#8217;s very easy to do. </p>
<p>I also invite you to join us at the <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Azimuth+Forum">Azimuth Forum</a>, where we are deciding the fate of humanity (or something like that).  We need your help!</p>
<p>In the weeks to come I want to tell you what we&#8217;ve learned so far.  I especially want to talk about various <i>plans of action</i> that people have formulated to tackle global warming.   Even sitting here in the comfort of this cozy blog, you can help us compare and criticize these plans.</p>
<p>But I also want to tell you about some interesting concepts. And the first is <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/EROEI">EROEI</a>, or &#8220;Energy Return On Energy Invested&#8221;.  The Azimuth Project entry on this concept was largely written by David Tweed. <i>Three cheers for David Tweed!</i> <img src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/emoticons/thumbsup.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>It also had help from Eric Forgy, Graham Jones and David Pollard, and a major contribution from Anonymous Coward.  I&#8217;ll shorten it and amp it up for the purposes of this blog.  I know you&#8217;re here to be entertained.</p>
<h4>The Idea</h4>
<p>You&#8217;ve probably heard the saying &#8220;it takes money to make money&#8221;.  Similarly, it takes energy to make energy.  More precisely, it takes <i>useful</i> energy to make <i>useful</i> energy.   </p>
<p><b>Energy Returned On Energy Invested</b> or <b>EROEI</b> captures this idea: it&#8217;s simply the ratio of &#8220;useful energy acquired&#8221; to &#8220;useful energy expended&#8221;. Note that <i>money</i> does not enter into this concept.  The difficult and often heated debate arises when we try to decide which inputs and outputs count as &#8220;useful&#8221;. </p>
<p>There are other names for this concept and closely related concepts.   &#8220;Energy profit ratio&#8221;, &#8220;surplus energy&#8221;, &#8220;energy gain&#8221;, and &#8220;EROI&#8221;, and EROEI all describe virtually the same idea: how much energy we receive per energy put in.  See: </p>
<p>&bull; Nate Hagen, <a href="//www.theoildrum.com/story/2006/8/2/114144/2387">A Net Energy Parable: Why is ERoEI Important?</a>, <i>The Oil Drum</i>, 2006.</p>
<p>The concept of &#8220;energy yield ratio&#8221; is also very similar, but tends to be used in slightly different ways.  See the <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/EROEI">Azimuth Project article</a> for more.</p>
<h4>Details</h4>
<p>The definition of EROEI for a process of &#8220;extracting energy&#8221;<br />
is the <i>useful acquired energy</i> divided by the <i>useful energy expended</i>. The &#8220;useful&#8221; tag denotes energy which is usable by human beings now.  For example: a supernova wastes a lot of energy in the process of making uranium and blasting it out into space.  But that was done long before we came along, so it makes no sense to include it in the EROEI inputs.  </p>
<p>In practice, people include inputs and outputs that aren&#8217;t strictly &#8220;energies&#8221;, but rather &#8220;substances from which energy can be extracted&#8221;.  For example: one could look at the EROEI of growing trees for fuel, where the wood produced is counted as an output according to the energy extractable by burning.</p>
<p>In general, having a high EROEI value counts as &#8220;good&#8221;. Indeed, when the EROEI drops below 1 more energy is being used in the extraction process than is being output at the end! But because it only considers energy issues (and not resource scarcity, scalability, pollution, etc.), EROEI should only be one input into our process of deciding on technologies and actions.</p>
<p>When it comes to computing EROEI, the hard part is deciding which inputs and outputs should be included in the ratio &mdash; particularly since this involves considering which other competing processes are genuinely viable. </p>
<p>Another complication is that while various forms of energy can generally be converted to each other, this will incur losses due to conversion inefficiencies. So, you can&#8217;t look at two schemes with the same useful energy inputs that produce different kinds of energy &mdash; e.g., electricity and heat &mdash; and declare the one with the higher EROEI as more suitable.</p>
<h4>Examples</h4>
<p>To see some of the difficulties in calculating an EROEI, let&#8217;s imagine growing a crop of grass and then fermenting it to produce a liquid fuel.  The most obvious inputs and outputs are:</p>
<p>&#8220;Energy&#8221; outputs:</p>
<p>1. The liquid fuel itself. This is unarguably useful output &#8220;energy&#8221;.</p>
<p>2. There may be excess heat produced by the fermentation process. Whether this is useful is debatable since the energy is of high entropy and produced at plants located away from energy consumers.</p>
<p>3. The remaining biomass may be suitable for burning. Again the usefulness is debatable, since the biomass may be better used for fertilising the fields used to grow the crop.  Even if this isn&#8217;t the case, the biomass may require yet more energy to collect into a dry, burnable state. </p>
<p>&#8220;Energy&#8221; inputs:</p>
<p>1. Sunlight. Except for exceptional circumstances, there is no other use for sunlight falling on fields so this does not count as a useful input.</p>
<p>2. Artificial fertilizer. This requires energy to produce and could be used for growing food or other crops, so it definitely counts as a useful energy input.</p>
<p>3. Energy used by motorized vehicles, both during farming and transportation to the biomass plant. For the same reasons as fertilizer, this counts as a useful energy input.</p>
<p>4. Mechanical energy used to extract liquid fuel after fermentation and clear waste products from the apparatus.  Again a useful energy input.</p>
<p>Thus one computation of EROEI would count outputs 1 and inputs 2, 3 and 4. </p>
<p>However, suppose that the grass crop is <i>genuinely</i> being grown for other reasons &mdash; e.g., as part of a crop rotation scheme &mdash; and the plant is sufficiently small that the excess heat can be used fully by the plant for staff heating. Then you could argue that the EROEI should count outputs 1 and 2 and count inputs 3 and 4.  So, to determine the EROEI you need to decide which alternative uses are genuinely viable.</p>
<p>Note also that this EROEI calculation is purely about energy!  It does not reflect issues such as whether the land usage is sustainable, possible soil depletion/erosion, scarcity of mineral inputs for artificial fertilizer, etc.</p>
<h4>Comparison</h4>
<p>Okay, but enough of these nuances and caveats.  Important as they are, I know what you really want: a list of different forms of energy and their EROEI&#8217;s! </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Natural gas: 10:1<br />
Coal: 50:1<br />
Oil (Ghawar supergiant field): 100:1<br />
Oil (global average): 19:1<br />
Tar sands: 5.2:1 to 5.8:1<br />
Oil shale: 1.5:1 to 4:1</p>
<p>Wind: 18:1<br />
Hydro: 11:1 to 267:1<br />
Waves: 15:1<br />
Tides: ~ 6:1<br />
Geothermal power: 2:1 to 13:1<br />
Solar photovoltaic power: 3.75:1 to 10:1<br />
Solar thermal: 1.6:1</p>
<p>Nuclear power: 1.1:1 to 15:1</p>
<p>Biodiesel: 1.9:1 to 9:1<br />
Ethanol: 0.5:1 to 8:1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This list comes from:</p>
<p>&bull; Richard Heinberg, <a href="http://richardheinberg.com/searching-for-a-miracle"><i>Searching for a Miracle: ‘Net Energy’ Limits &amp; the Fate of Industrial Society</i></a>.</p>
<p>You can read this report for more details on how he computed these numbers.  If you&#8217;re like me, you&#8217;ll take a perverse interest in forms of energy production with the <i>lowest</i> EROEIs.  For example, what idiot would make ethanol in a way that yields only <i>half as much useful energy as it takes to make the stuff?</i>   </p>
<p>The US government, that&#8217;s who: the powerful <a href="http://sugarcaneblog.com/2010/07/22/corn-lobby-has-dire-warning-for-loss-of-ethanol-subsidy/">corn lobby</a> has been getting subsidies for some highly inefficient forms of biofuel!    But things vary a lot from place to place: corn grows better in the heart of the corn belt (like Iowa) than near the edges (like Texas).  So, the production of a bushel of corn in Iowa costs 43 megajoules of energy on average, while in Texas it costs 71 megajoules.  </p>
<p>Similar, ethanol from sugar cane in Brazil has an EROEI of 8:1 to 10:1, but when made from Louisiana sugar cane in the United States, the EROEI is closer to 1:1.</p>
<p>&#8220;Solar thermal&#8221; also comes out looking bad in the table above, with an EROEI of just 1.6:1.  But what&#8217;s &#8220;solar thermal&#8221;?  Heinberg has a section on &#8220;active&#8221; or &#8220;concentrating&#8221; solar thermal power, where you focus sunlight to heat a liquid to drive a turbine.  He also has one on &#8220;passive&#8221; solar, where you heat your house, or water, by sun falling on it.  But he doesn&#8217;t give EROEI&#8217;s in either of these sections &mdash; unlike the sections on other forms of energy.  So I can&#8217;t see where this figure of 1.6 is coming from.</p>
<p>Anyway, there&#8217;s a lot to think about here.  Each one of the numbers listed above could serve as the starting-point for a fascinating discussion!  Let&#8217;s start&#8230;</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>The Azimuth Project is taking off!  Today I woke up and found two new articles full of cool stuff I hadn&#8217;t known.  Check them out:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/EROEI">EROEI</a>, about the idea of Energy Returned on Energy Invested.</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Peak+phosphorus">Peak phosphorus</a>, about the crucial role of phosphorus as a fertilizer, and how the moment of peak phosphorus production may have already passed.  </p>
<p>Both were initiated by David Tweed, but they&#8217;ve both already been polished by other people &mdash; Eric Forgy and Graham Jones, so far.  So, it&#8217;s working!</p>
<p><b>Here&#8217;s the easiest way for you to help save the planet today:</b></p>
<p>1) Think of the most important book or article you&#8217;ve read about environmental problems, how to solve them, or some closely related topic.</p>
<p>2) Go to the <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Recommended+reading">Recommended reading</a> page on Azimuth.</p>
<p>3) Click the button that says &#8220;Edit&#8221; at the bottom left.</p>
<p>4) Add your recommended reading!  You&#8217;ll see items that look sort of like this:</p>

					<p>Here&#8217;s the long-promised wiki:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/HomePage">The Azimuth Project</a></p>
<p>We&#8217;re going to make this into <i>the place</i> where scientists and engineers will go when they&#8217;re looking for reliable information on environmental problems, or ideas for projects to work on.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve got our work cut out for us.  If you click the link today &mdash; September 27th, 2010 &mdash; you won&#8217;t see much there.  But I promise to keep making it better, with bulldog determination.  And I hope you join me. </p>
<p>In addition to the wiki there&#8217;s a discussion forum:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Mathforge/Azimuth/">The Azimuth Forum</a></p>
<p>where we can discuss work in progress on the Azimuth Project, engage in collaborative research, and decide on Azimuth policies. </p>
<p>Anybody can read the stuff on the Azimuth Forum.  But if you want to join the conversation, you need to become a member.  To learn how, <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/ForumHelp">read this</a> and carefully follow the steps.    </p>
<p>You&#8217;ll see a few sample articles on the Azimuth Project wiki, but they&#8217;re really just stubs.  My plan now is to systematically go through some big issues &mdash; starting with some we&#8217;ve already discussed here &mdash; and blog about them.  The resulting blog posts, and your responses to them, will then be fed into the wiki.  My goal is to generate:</p>
<p>&bull; readable, reliable summaries of environmental challenges we face,</p>
<p>&bull; pointers to scientists and engineers working on these challenges,</p>
<p>and lists of</p>
<p>&bull; ideas these people have had,</p>
<p>&bull; questions that they have,</p>
<p>&bull; questions that they <i>should</i> be thinking about, but aren’t. </p>
<p>Let the games begin!  Let&#8217;s try to keep this planet a wonderful place!</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p><a href="http://gowers.wordpress.com/">Timothy Gowers</a> posted a comment on the &#8216;Technology for Azimuth&#8217; thread which deserves to be a post in its own right.  So, I&#8217;ll move it here:</p>
<blockquote><p>
John, this isn&#8217;t to do with the technological questions, but it&#8217;s sort of relevant. One of the reasons I&#8217;ve done nothing about climate change is a feeling that even if the science were 100% clear to all serious-minded people in the world, there are enough non-serious-minded people and vested interests, and enough prisoner&#8217;s-dilemma type problems, that actually getting something done about the problem is hopeless.</p>
<p>My question therefore is what you mean when you say that you want to help save the planet. Or rather, I think I know the answer, but I want to check that I&#8217;ve got it right. Is it something like this: you want to create a resource that is so well-informed (it would get a reputation for being scientifically very sound) and so balanced (it would also get a reputation for being very clear about what is known and what is not known, and what the general certainty levels are) that it would become a recognised authority, and one that cranks would have a very hard time criticizing. </p>
<p>Why does that help save the planet? For precisely the political reasons I&#8217;ve just talked about. It is clear that actually changing policy is much much easier if you have most voters on your side. And to do that, people have to act as go-betweens, explaining the science in a clear and checkable way to non-scientists. In other words, you would be trying to help push the world towards a benign tipping point where it becomes politically easy to take measures against climate change rather than politically virtually impossible.</p>
<p>If something like that is your mission statement, then a general remark about the technology of the forum and wiki would be that it should be designed to optimize the result from that point of view. (That is supposed to be the very slight relevance of this comment to this thread, but really I&#8217;m interested in the question for its own sake.)
</p></blockquote>
<p>My reply:</p>
<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree, <b>it&#8217;s hopeless</b>.  That&#8217;s an important realization.  I was rather gloomy for a year or two after that sank in.</p>
<p>But then I came to my senses.  I said: okay, so the problem is &#8220;hopeless&#8221;.  But what does that actually mean?  Is the world coming to an end?  Will everyone die?  Will all species go extinct?  </p>
<p>I think the answer is obviously <i>no</i>.</p>
<p>If the world were coming to an end, and we knew that for sure, we&#8217;d be off the hook.  We could say: &#8220;Nothing I do will have any really have any effect, so I might as well just relax and enjoy myself&#8221;.  </p>
<p>But we are not off the hook.  <b>Even if a disaster of some sort is certain, there are different degrees of disaster, and it&#8217;s our responsibility to minimize the disaster.</b>  </p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure that politicians and the mass of citizens will take significant action on global warming only when things get quite bad.  By then, <a href="http://www.nature.com/climate/2008/0812/full/climate.2008.122.html" rel="nofollow">even drastically slashing carbon emissions won&#8217;t improve the climate for hundreds of years</a>.  Emission reductions will be necessary to keep things from getting worse, but not sufficient to make things better.  </p>
<p>So, while we&#8217;re frantically struggling to cut carbon emissions, kicking ourselves for not starting sooner, we&#8217;ll presumably also do a mixture of:</p>
<p>1) adaptation,</p>
<p>2) geo-engineering, and</p>
<p>3) suffering.</p>
<p>(Under the heading of &#8216;geo-engineering&#8217; I include actively removing CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere as well as various potentially riskier strategies to cool down the Earth &mdash; including strategies that could backfire and make things a lot worse.)</p>
<p>But how will it go, exactly?  I think there&#8217;s quite a spectrum of possible futures to consider here, ranging from slightly bad to quite bad to very bad to very <i><b>very</b></i> bad.  And I think we should all work hard to avoid the worst end of that spectrum.  </p>
<p>And we have to do it now, because people don&#8217;t always get better at optimizing their collective behavior when things get worse.  Sometimes they do things like start wars.</p>
<p>(Civilizations have collapsed due to climate change before.  I&#8217;ve been reading about that a lot, and I&#8217;ll talk about it someday.)</p>
<blockquote><p>
My question therefore is what you mean when you say that you want to help save the planet.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I mean I want to do my best to achieve a future near the better end of the spectrum of possibilities.  </p>
<p>But of course the question is then: <i>how do I do it?</i></p>
<p>And the answer to this presumably depends a lot on the person asking it.  We&#8217;re all good at different things, and if we take advantage of our particular skills, I think we can accomplish a lot more than if we do what&#8217;s &#8216;best&#8217; in some general way but not particularly best for us.</p>
<p>So, while global warming is mainly a political issue, and we really need some brilliant politicians to tackle it, I have to figure out something else to do &mdash; something that <i>I&#8217;ll</i> be good at &mdash; since I&#8217;m not good at politics.  And I&#8217;m still trying to figure this out.  But I have some ideas.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Is it something like this: you want to create a resource that is so well-informed (it would get a reputation for being scientifically very sound) and so balanced (it would also get a reputation for being very clear about what is known and what is not known, and what the general certainty levels are) that it would become a recognised authority, and one that cranks would have a very hard time criticizing.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually that&#8217;s not quite my goal &mdash; though it&#8217;s close enough that I might try to do that <i>too</i>.</p>
<p>You see, I do think it&#8217;s important to make reliable and well-presented information about environmental issues more easily available.   But I don&#8217;t think making it &#8216;hard for cranks to criticize&#8217; should be a major goal.   That strategy is too purely defensive.  And cranks will criticize anything.</p>
<p>Of course you can try to provide information that&#8217;s so clear that <i>ordinary citizens</i> will see it makes much more sense than what the cranks are saying.  And this is a good idea &#8212; though at least in the US, it would be quite hard to change a lot of minds that are already made up.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m starting to lean towards something more like this: try to provide information that&#8217;s so clear that <i>scientists and engineers</i> will see it makes much more sense than what the cranks are saying.</p>
<p>And, simultaneously, provide these scientists and engineers with ideas about <i>what they can do now</i>. There are lots of projects to work on.  Lots of scientists are already doing them &#8212; but where can you look to see all these projects, in a nicely organized way?  Where can you see people with many different approaches discussing their relative merits?  I think there might be a hole here.</p>
<p>Ideas are welcome!  That&#8217;s one thing the Azimuth Forum will be about: what to do.

I don&#8217;t know what John&#8217;s &#8220;tactics&#8221; are, but here&#8217;s my personal &#8220;hopes&#8221;.</p>
<p>The view of vested interests, whilst certainly having some truth to it, doesn&#8217;t strike me as the whole story.  Human beings are incredibly, amazingly bizarre creatures with almost often seemingly arbitrary obsessions. There are all sort of phenomena (for recent examples consider twitter, buying iPads, the tea party movement, owning a Prius, buying fairtrade, etc, as well as older examples such as &#8220;sending me to the moon&#8221;) where (in my personal analysis) an awful lot of the people involved don&#8217;t really have deep personally thought out reasons for their behaviour, they&#8217;re more responding to something in the collective atmosphere (&#8220;zeitgeist&#8221;) that vaguely resonates with existing personality and values. <em>Note that I&#8217;m not saying that there aren&#8217;t some people engaged in any of those activities who haven&#8217;t thought long and hard about them and that they aren&#8217;t necessarily good things, just that most of the &#8220;followers&#8221; haven&#8217;t.</em> And it seems like with increasing media ubiquity and commonality, the size of &#8220;group behaviours&#8221; is increasing all the time. (FWIW, I&#8217;m sure I have my own zeitgeist behaviours, it&#8217;s not an &#8220;I&#8217;m superior to them&#8221; point.)</p>
<p>As such, it doesn&#8217;t seem <em>impossible</em> to me that, if scientists and technologists come up with some &#8220;improvements&#8221; (whether it&#8217;s a gadget, technology, behaviour) that it could be marketed in such a way that they become various group behaviours that are big enough to affect the planet. (Whilst not impossible, it does strike me as unlikely, but orders of magnitude more plausible than governments acting on the basis of scientific reports, which I imagine we both think is virtually impossible.)</p>
<p>So what I&#8217;d hope is that the Azimuth resources point new scientists/technologists to both</p>
<p>(a) actual problems to work on responses</p>
<p>(b) areas where science doesn&#8217;t have any idea what&#8217;s going on so that they can be firmed up into concrete problems and feed into point (a).
</p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed, these are some of the things I hope we do!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to Bali for a while, but then I&#8217;ll come back and on September 27th I&#8217;ll open the doors to:</p>
<p>&bull; the Azimuth Project (our wiki) </p>
<p>and </p>
<p>&bull; the Azimuth Forum (our discussion forum).</p>
<p>The Azimuth Forum will be a great place to discuss issues of strategy as well as more day-to-day aspects of running the wiki.  But for now let&#8217;s talk about strategy here.  </p>
<p>We need to be smart about this to have any significant effect.</p>

				<small>11 September, 2010</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/07/26/technology-for-azimuth/">A while back</a> we agreed to set up a wiki and also a discussion forum associated to this blog.  The idea is this: we accumulate lots of interesting information here, but that information is hard to find, because it&#8217;s not well organized.  So, let&#8217;s put it on a wiki!  But how should this wiki work?  Well, we can talk about that on the discussion forum.</p>
<p>Now the wiki and the discussion forum have been created, thanks to Andrew Stacey:</p>
<p>&bull; The wiki is called <b>The Azimuth Project</b>, and it will start out looking <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/HomePage"><b>a lot like this</b></a>.</p>
<p>&bull; the forum is called <b>The Azimuth Forum</b>, and it will start out looking <a href="http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Mathforge/nForum/"><b>a lot like this.</b></a></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mind drastic changes if someone else is willing to put in the work to make them.  With luck, vast improvements will occur over time.  But for now, this is what we&#8217;ve got.</p>
<p>But there are still some basic decisions to be made.</p>
<p>You see, all this stuff already happened once before, back when I worked on a branch of math called <i>n</i>-category theory.  First a team of people started a blog: the <a href="http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/"><i>n</i>-Category Caf&eacute;</a>.  We accumulated so much information that we decided to put it on a wiki: the <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/HomePage"><i>n</i>Lab</a>.  But it proved hard to make decisions about the <i>n</i>Lab using the blog, since on a typical blog, only blog hosts can start conversations.   So Andrew created the <a href="http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Mathforge/nForum/"><i>n</i>Forum</a>.   </p>
<p>It worked great, so I&#8217;m trying to copy that pattern using the exact same technology.  But there are some differences.  </p>
<p>First of all, last time it all evolved organically.  We had a <i>team</i> of bloggers who agreed about what to do.  I would love to get a team of bloggers here on Azimuth, and I intend to, but it hasn&#8217;t happened yet.  </p>
<p>Second, the topics I&#8217;m discussing now are more controversial.  Nobody cares about <i>n</i>-categories, except for people who actually understand them.  Everybody cares about climate change, nuclear energy, and so on &mdash; including lots of people who are quite ignorant of the details.  The stakes are higher, and the fundamental differences of opinion harder to reconcile.</p>
<p>So, I&#8217;ve got some questions.   For example:</p>
<p>Should everyone be allowed to make changes to the Azimuth Project wiki, or just people who are qualified in some way?  Should everyone be allowed to discuss things on the Azimuth Forum, or just people who are qualified in some way?</p>
<p>Of course, we can also just wing it: try something, and see if it works.  </p>
<p>I want things to take off quickly, but I want them to work reasonably well.   Discussions are necessary to correct errors and figure things out, but I don&#8217;t want people to waste a lot of time in unproductive flame wars.  I don&#8217;t mind if people argue heatedly in an area designated for that purpose: the Azimuth Forum can be configured to make this easy.   But I want to work with people who roughly agree with my overall approach, not fight with people who don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s my overall approach?  Well, you can begin to see it from this blog so far.  But I have big ambitions: I want to <b>create a focal point for scientists and engineers interested in saving the planet</b>, and <b>make clearly presented, accurate information on the relevant issues easy to find</b>.</p>
<p>Please help me figure this out.  I want to get this thing started.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>A bunch of us want to set up a wiki associated to Azimuth, so we can more effectively gather and distribute scientific knowledge related to the overarching theme of &#8220;how to save the planet&#8221;.     </p>
<p>It may also good to have a &#8220;discussion forum&#8221; associated to that wiki, in addition to the blog here, where I &mdash; and other people, once I find some good co-bloggers &mdash; hold forth.   A blog is a good place for a few people to lead discussions.  A different sort of discussion forum, more like the <a href="http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Vanilla/nForum/?CategoryID=5">nForum</a>, would be a more democratic environment, good for developing a wiki.</p>
<p>But what exactly should we do?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s discuss that question here&#8230; I&#8217;m going to copy or move some comments from the <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/07/10/welcome-to-azimuth/">welcome page to here</a>, to get things going.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Hello!  This is John Baez&#8217;s new blog.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a mathematical physicist.  I teach at U.C. Riverside, but tonight my wife and I are flying to Singapore.  For two years she&#8217;ll be teaching at the philosophy department of the National University of Singapore, and I&#8217;ll be working at the <a href="http://www.quantumlah.org/">Centre for Quantum Technologies</a>.   This will be a good time to change gears and try something new.    I&#8217;ve been working on<em> n</em>-categories and fundamental physics, but now I want to work on more practical things, too.</p>
<p>Why?  I keep realizing more and more that the Earth is in serious trouble! The deep secrets of math and physics are endlessly engrossing &#8212; but they can wait, and other things can&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I hope we talk about many things here: from math to physics to earth science, biology, computer science, economics, and the technologies of today and tomorrow &#8211; but in general, centered around the theme of <em>what scientists can do to help save the planet.</em>  </p>
<p>That sounds pretty ambitious, verging on pompous.  Right now, though, it&#8217;s midnight and I&#8217;m sitting in the airport lounge in Los Angeles waiting for a 1:40 am flight to Hong Kong, and then a connection to Singapore.  So, that&#8217;s all for now.  I just felt like kicking off this new blog&#8230;</p>

			<div class="textwidget"><p>You can <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics">include math in your comments using LaTeX</a>,  but you need to do it this way:</p>
<p>&#036;latex  E = mc^2&#036;</p>
<p>You need the word 'latex' right after the first dollar sign, and it needs a space after it.  Double dollar signs don't work, and other limitations apply, some described <a href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/latex/">here</a>.  You can't preview comments here, but I'm happy to fix errors.</p>
