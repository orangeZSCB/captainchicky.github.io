<p>&bull; Stephen Pacala and Robert Socolow, <a href="http://www.uwyo.edu/findingsupport/docs/Stabilization%20Wdges.pdf">Stabilization wedges: solving the climate problem for the next 50 years using current technologies</a>, <i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/305/5686/968">Science</a></i> <b>305</b> (2004), 968-972.</p>
<p>The paper lists 15 &#8216;wedges&#8217;, each of which could ramp up to  reducing carbon emissions by 1 gigaton/year by 2054.   We&#8217;re going through all these wedges and discussing them.   And the Azimuth Project is lucky to have a new member on board &mdash; <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Frederik+De+Roo">Frederik De Roo</a> &mdash; who is summarizing our discussion here:</p>
<p>&bull; Azimuth Project, <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Stabilization+wedges">Stabilization wedges</a>.</p>
<p>So, let&#8217;s get going!</p>
<p><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/11/16/stabilization-wedges/">Last time</a> we covered four wedges related to energy conservation and increased efficiency.  Wedge 5 is in a category of its own:</p>
<p>5. <b>Shifting from coal to natural gas</b>. Natural gas puts out half as much CO<sub>2</sub> as coal does when you burn them to make a given amount of electricity.  After all, it&#8217;s mainly methane, which is made from hydrogen as well as carbon.   Suppose by 2054 we have coal power plants working at 90% of capacity with an efficiency of 50%.  700 gigawatts worth of coal plants like this emit 1 gigaton of carbon per year.  So, we can reduce carbon emissions by one &#8216;wedge&#8217; if we replace 1400 gigawatts of such plants with gas-burning plants.  That&#8217;s four times the 2004 worldwide total of gas-burning plants.</p>
<p>Wedges 6-8 involve carbon capture and storage:</p>
<p>6.  <b>Capturing CO<sub>2</sub> at power plants</b>. Carbon capture and storage at power plants can stop about 90% of the carbon from reaching the atmosphere, so we can get a wedge by doing this for 800 GW of coal-burning power plants or 1600 GW of gas-burning power plants by 2054.  One way to do carbon capture and storage is to make hydrogen and CO<sub>2</sub> from fossil fuels, burn the hydrogen in a power plant, and inject the CO<sub>2</sub> into the ground.   So, from one viewpoint, building a wedge&#8217;s worth of carbon capture and storage would resemble a tenfold expansion of the plants that were manufacturing hydrogen in 2004.  But it would also require multiplying by 100 the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> injected into the ground.  </p>
<p>7.  <b>Capturing CO<sub>2</sub> at plants that make hydrogen for fuel</b>.  You&#8217;ve probably heard people dream of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_economy">hydrogen economy</a>.  But it takes energy to make hydrogen.  One way is to copy wedge 6, but then ship the hydrogen off for use as fuel instead of burning it to make electricity at power plants.   To capture a wedge&#8217;s worth of carbon this way, we&#8217;d have to make 250 megatons of hydrogen per year from coal, or 500 megatons per year from natural gas.  This would require a substantial scale-up from the 2004 total of 40 megatons of hydrogen manufactured by all methods.  There would also be the task of building the infrastructure for a hydrogen economy.  The challenge of injecting CO<sub>2</sub> into the ground would be the same as in wedge 6.</p>
<p>8.  <b>Capturing CO<sub>2</sub> at plants that turn coal into synthetic fuels</b>.   As the world starts <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Peak+oil">running out of oil</a>, people may start turning coal into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_fuel">synfuels</a>, via a process called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal_liquefaction">coal liquefaction</a>.  Of course burning these synfuels will release carbon.  But suppose only half of the carbon entering a synfuels plant leaves as fuel, while the other half can be captured as CO<sub>2</sub> and injected underground.  Then we can capture a wedge&#8217;s worth of CO<sub>2</sub> from coal synfuels plants that produce 1.8 teraliters of synfuels per year.  For comparison, total yearly world oil production in 2004 was <a href="http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/iedindex3.cfm?tid=5&amp;pid=53&amp;aid=1&amp;cid=ww,&amp;syid=2004&amp;eyid=2007&amp;unit=TBPD">4.7 teraliters</a>.  </p>
<p>Now: <i>What are the pros and cons of these four wedges?  What is the biggest thing that Pacala and Socolow overlooked?</i></p>
<p>I&#8217;m puzzled about the last wedge.  Pacala and Socolow say 1 gigaton carbon/year is the flow of carbon in 24 million barrels/day, or 1.4 teraliters/year.  They assume the same value for synfuels and allow for imperfect capture, which leads them to conclude that carbon capture at synfuels plants producing 1.8 teraliters/year of synfuel can catch 1 GtC/year.  But this calculation doesn&#8217;t make sense to me.  If we&#8217;re catching just half the carbon, and 1 GtC/year = 1.4 teraliters oil/year, don&#8217;t we need to generate at least twice that &mdash; 2.8 teraliters synfuel/year &mdash; to catch wedge&#8217;s worth of carbon?  </p>
<p>I&#8217;m also unclear what percentage of the carbon you can actually capture while turning coal into synfuels.  Can you really capture half of it? </p>
<p>There&#8217;s also another funny feature of this last wedge.  If we assume people are <i>already committed</i> to making synfuels from coal, then I guess it&#8217;s true, they&#8217;ll emit less carbon if they use carbon capture and storage as part of the manufacturing process.  But compared to making electricity or hydrogen as in wedges 6 and 7, turning coal into synfuels seems bound to emit more carbon, even with the help of carbon capture and storage.</p>
<p>In general, it only makes sense to talk about how much carbon emission some action prevents when we compare it to some <i>alternative</i> action.  That&#8217;s pretty obvious, but it gets a bit confusing when some of Pacala and Socolow&#8217;s wedges look like plausible alternatives to other ones.</p>
<p>Another question: how does carbon capture and storage work, actually?  Summarizing Pacala and Socolow, I wrote: </p>
<blockquote><p>
One way to do carbon capture and storage is to make hydrogen and CO<sub>2</sub> from fossil fuels, burn the hydrogen in a power plant, and inject the CO<sub>2</sub> into the ground.
</p></blockquote>
<p>But I&#8217;d like to learn the details!</p>

				<h2><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/11/19/fossil-fuel-subsidies/" rel="bookmark">Fossil Fuel Subsidies</a></h2>
				<small>19 November, 2010</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>Today my friend Bruce Smith pointed out this:</p>
<p>&bull; How to save $300 billion, <i><a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/newsbook/2010/11/fossil-fuel_subsidies">The Economist Online</a></i>, 12 November 2010.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an executive summary for you busy folks:</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s <i><a href="http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/">World Energy Outlook</a></i>, put out by the International Energy Agency, says that governments spent $312 billion on subsidies for fossil fuels in 2009.  </p>
<p>According to the IEA, eliminating these subsidies would reduce the world&#8217;s energy demand by 5%: the current energy consumption of Japan, Korea and New Zealand combined.  It would also reduce carbon emissions by about 0.4-0.5 gigatons by 2020.  </p>
<p>(I think they mean <i>annual</i> carbon emissions.  They also say &#8220;this is more than a third of the difference between business-as-usual emissions and the level needed to stand something like a 50:50 chance of limiting global warming to two degrees centigrade&#8221;, but that seems overly optimistic to me, given the figures I&#8217;ve been reading.)</p>
<p>Of the $312 billion in subsidies, more than a fifth comes from one country: Iran. To keep fuel prices as low as ten American cents a liter for gasoline &mdash; two cents for diesel &mdash; the Iranian government spent $66 billion in 2009.   That’s $895 per person, or 20% of their GDP.  </p>
<p>Saudi Arabia’s subsidy is even higher per capita, though lower overall and under 10% of GDP.  (Guess what percent of their GDP comes from oil.)</p>
<p>Uzbekistan’s fossil fuel subsidy is even more absurd: a whopping 32% of GDP.  </p>
<p>What is it for the USA, and the other countries the readers of this blog live in?  What can we do to reduce or end these obscene subsidies?</p>

				<small>16 November, 2010</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>Okay, let&#8217;s look at some plans for combating global warming!  And let&#8217;s start with this paper:</p>
<p>&bull; Stephen Pacala and Robert Socolow, <a href="http://www.uwyo.edu/findingsupport/docs/Stabilization%20Wdges.pdf">Stabilization wedges: solving the climate problem for the next 50 years using current technologies</a>, <i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/305/5686/968">Science</a></i> <b>305</b> (2004), 968-972.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t try to summarize it all today, just a bit.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Stephen+Pacala">Stephen Pacala</a> and <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Robert+Socolow">Robert Socolow</a> wrote this now-famous paper in 2004.  Back then we were emitting about 6.2 gigatons of carbon per year, there were 375 ppm of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and many proposals to limit global warming urged that we keep the concentration below 500 ppm.  Their paper outlined some strategies for keeping it below 500 ppm.</p>
<p>They estimated that to do this, it would be enough to hold emissions <i>flat</i> at 7 gigatons of carbon per year for 50 years, and then lower it to nothing.  On the other hand, in a &#8220;business as usual&#8221; scenario, they estimate the emissions would ramp up to 14 gigatons per year by 2054.   That&#8217;s 7 too many.  </p>
<p>So, to keep emissions flat it would be enough to find 7 ways to reduce carbon emissions, each one of which ramps up linearly to the point of reducing carbon emissions by 1 gigaton/year in 2054.   They called these <b>stabilization wedges</b>, because if you graph them, they look like wedges:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://www.uwyo.edu/findingsupport/docs/Stabilization%20Wdges.pdf"><br />
<img src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/pacala_socolow_seven_wedges.jpg" /><br />
</a></div>
<p>Their paper listed 15 possible stabilization wedges, each one with the potential to reduce carbon emissions by 1 gigaton/year by 2054.  This is a nice way to start thinking about a very big problem, so many people have adopted it and modified it and criticized it in various ways, which I hope to discuss later.  Right now I&#8217;ll only tell you about the original paper.</p>
<p>But before I even list any of their stabilization wedges, I should emphasize: <b><i>stabilizing emissions at 7 gigatons is not enough to stay below 500 ppm forever!</i></b> Carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Carbon+is+forever">a very long time</a>.  So, as Pacala and Socolow note:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Stabilization at any level requires that net emissions do not simply remain constant, but eventually drop to zero. For example, in one simple model that begins with the stabilization triangle but looks beyond 2054, 500-ppm stabilization is achieved by 50 years of flat emissions, followed by a linear decline of about two-thirds in the following 50 years, and a very slow decline thereafter that matches the declining ocean sink. To develop the revolutionary technologies required for such large emissions reductions in the second half of the century, enhanced research and development would have to begin immediately.
</p></blockquote>
<p>What&#8217;s the &#8220;declining ocean sink&#8221;?  Right now the ocean is absorbing a lot of CO<sub>2</sub>, temporarily saving us from the full brunt of our carbon emissions &mdash; while coral reefs, shellfish and certain forms of plankton suffer from increased acidity.   But this won&#8217;t go on forever; the ocean has limited capacity.  </p>
<p>Pacala and Socolow consider several categories of climate wedges:</p>
<p>&bull; efficiency and conservation<br />
&bull; shifting from coal to gas<br />
&bull; carbon capture and storage<br />
&bull; nuclear fission<br />
&bull; renewable energy sources<br />
&bull; forests and agriculture</p>
<p>Today let me just go through the first category.  Here they list four wedges:</p>
<p>1. <b>Efficient vehicles: increase the fuel economy for 2 billion cars from 30 to 60 miles per gallon</b>.  Or, for those of you who don&#8217;t have the incredible good luck of living in the USA: increasing it from 13 to 26 kilometers per liter.  When they wrote their paper, there were 500 million cars on the planet.  They expected that by 2054 this number would quadruple.  When they wrote their paper, average fuel efficiency was 13 kilometers/liter.  To achieve this wedge, we&#8217;d need that to double.</p>
<p>2. <b>Reduced use of vehicles: decrease car travel for 2 billion 30-mpg cars from 10,000 to 5000 miles per year</b>.   In other words: decreasing the average travel from 16,000 to 8000 kilometers per year.  (Clearly this wedge and the previous one are not additive: if we do them both, we don&#8217;t save 2 gigatons of carbon per year.)</p>
<p>3. <b>Efficient buildings: cut carbon emissions by one-fourth in buildings and appliances</b>.  This could be done by following “known and established approaches” to energy efficient space heating and cooling, water heating, lighting, and refrigeration.  Half the potential savings are in the buildings in developing countries.</p>
<p>4. <b>Efficient coal plants: raise the efficiency of coal power plants to 60%</b>.  In 2004, when they wrote their paper, &#8220;coal plants, operating on average at 32% efficiency, produced about one fourth of all carbon emissions: 1.7 GtC/year out of 6.2 GtC/year.&#8221;   They expected coal power plants to double their output by 2054.  To achieve this wedge, we&#8217;d need their average efficiency to reach 60%.</p>
<p>There are lot of questions to ask!  Which do you think are the most easily achieved of these wedges?  What are the biggest problems with their reasoning so far?  And so on&#8230;</p>
<p>I would <i>love</i> any interesting information you have on: 1) ways to make vehicles more efficient, 2) ways to coax people to drive less, 3) ways to make buildings more efficient, and 4) ways to make coal power plants more efficient.  Please post it here, with references if you can!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll conclude for now with a couple of tiny points.  First, they seem to vacillate a bit between saying there were 6.2 and 7 gigatons of carbon emitted in 2004, which is a bit odd, but perhaps just a way of giving the world a bit of slack before levelling off emissions at 7 GtC/year.  I guess it&#8217;s not really a big deal.</p>
<p>Second, they aren&#8217;t idiots: despite the above graph, they don&#8217;t really think carbon emissions will increase <i>linearly</i> in a business-as-usual scenario.  This is just a deliberate simplification on their part.  They also show this supposedly more accurate graph:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://www.uwyo.edu/findingsupport/docs/Stabilization%20Wdges.pdf"><br />
<img src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/pacala_socolow_business_as_usual.jpg" /><br />
</a>
</div>
<p>They say the top curve is &#8220;a representative business as usual emissions path&#8221; for global carbon emissions in the form of CO<sub>2</sub> from fossil fuel combustion and cement manufacture, assuming 1.5% per year growth starting from 7.0 GtC/year in 2004.  Note this ignores carbon emissions from deforestation, other greenhouse gases, etc.   This curve is growing exponentially, not linearly.</p>
<p>Similarly, the bottom curve isn&#8217;t flat: it slopes down. They say the bottom curve is a &#8220;CO<sub>2</sub> emissions path consistent with atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> stabilization at 500 ppm by 2125 akin to the Wigley, Richels, and Edmonds (WRE) family of stabilization curves described in [11], modified as described in Section 1 of the SOM text.&#8221;</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>I want to start talking about plans for cutting back carbon emissions, and some scenarios for what may happen, depending on what we do.  We&#8217;ve got to figure this stuff out!</p>
<p> You&#8217;ve probably heard of <a href="http://www.350.org/en/about/science">350.org</a>, the grassroots organization that&#8217;s trying to cut CO<sub>2</sub> levels from their current level of about 390 parts per million back down to 350.   That&#8217;s a noble goal. However, even stabilizing at some much higher level will require a massive effort, given how long CO<sub>2</sub> stays in the atmosphere:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://www.globalwarmingart.com/wiki/File:Carbon_Stabilization_Scenarios_png"><br />
<img border="none" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature/Carbon_Stabilization_Scenarios.jpg" /><br />
</a>
</div>
<p>In a famous 2004 paper, <a href="http://www.uwyo.edu/findingsupport/docs/Stabilization%20Wdges.pdf">Pacala and Socolow</a> estimated that in a &#8220;business-as-usual&#8221; scenario, carbon emissions would rise to 14 gigatons per year by 2054&#8230; while to keep CO<sub>2</sub> below 500 ppm, they&#8217;d need to be held to 7 gigatons/year.  </p>
<p>Alas, we&#8217;ve already gone up to 8 gigatons of carbon per year!  How can we possibly keep things from getting much worse?  Pacala and Socolow listed 15 measures, each of which could cut 1 gigaton of carbon per year:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/diary/carbon_wedges_socolow.jpg"><br />
<img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/diary/carbon_wedges_socolow.jpg" alt="" /><br />
</a>
</div>
<p>(Click for a bigger image.)</p>
<p>Each one of these measures is big.  For example, if you like nuclear power: build 700 gigawatts of nuclear power plants, <i>doubling</i> what we have now.  But if you prefer wind: build turbines with 2000 gigawatts of peak capacity, <i>multiplying by 50</i> what we have now.   Or: build photovoltaic solar power plants with 2000 gigawatts of peak capacity, <i>multiplying by 700</i> what we have now!</p>
<p>Now imagine doing lots of these things&#8230;</p>
<p>What if we do nothing?  Some <a href="http://globalchange.mit.edu/pubs/abstract.php?publication_id=990">MIT scientists</a> estimate that in a business-as-usual scenario, by 2095 there will be about 890 parts per million of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere, and a 90% chance of a temperature increase between 3.5 and 7.3 degrees Celsius.  Pick your scenario!

<p>(Again, click for a bigger image.)</p>
<p>Of course the <i>Stern Review</i> has its detractors.  I&#8217;m not claiming any of these issues are settled: I&#8217;m just trying to get the discussion started here.   In the weeks to come, I want to go through plans and assessments in more detail, to compare them and try to find the truth.</p>

				<h2><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/11/02/2010-singapore-energy-lecture/" rel="bookmark">2010 Singapore Energy&nbsp;Lecture</a></h2>
				<small>2 November, 2010</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>Yesterday morning Lisa and I took a bus downtown to see the Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Hsien Loong, give the Singapore Energy Lecture.  It was part of a big annual event, the <a href="http://singapore.iew.com.sg/">Singapore International Energy Week</a>.  We met our friend Walter Blackstock, had a last cup of coffee, and filed into a banquet room, along with about 800 businessmen, to see what the Prime Minister had to say.</p>
<p>His lecture was clear and precise &mdash; very different than the rhetoric-filled talk I&#8217;m used to from American politicians when it comes to energy.  He began by discussing the twin problems of <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Peak+oil">peak oil</a> and <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Global+warming">global warming</a>.   </p>
<p>&#8216;Peak oil&#8217; refers to the idea that oil production, having risen, is bound to eventually fall; of course this idea gains teeth when one believes it will fall rather soon.  Mr Lee gave some evidence that oil production will fall in the next few decades, but then pointed out that similar predictions had been made before, and had turned out to be wrong.  He concluded in an agnostic vein, and added that there are still huge supplies of coal, which become more useful as gasification technologies improve.  What interested me was his use of the term &#8216;peak oil&#8217;, which I&#8217;ve never heard from the lips of an American president.  But of course, I&#8217;ve never seen one speak at an energy conference.</p>
<p>He then noted that even if there are plenty of fossil fuels, burning them leads to global warming.  He mentioned the <a href="http://cc2010.mx/en/">2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference</a>, which will be held in Cancún, Mexico, from 29 November to 10 December.  He said that if an agreement is reached, Singapore would abide by it and impose a price on carbon.  He <a href="http://www.todayonline.com/Singapore/EDC101102-0000070/Making-the-right-energy-choice">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;If there&#8217;s a global regime to curb carbon emissions, that means that Singapore will have to reduce our own emissions more sharply than we are doing now, in order to comply with international obligations, and we would have to make the carbon price explicit to send the right price signals.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Increases in efficiency would not be enough, he noted, because of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_effect_%28conservation%29">&#8216;rebound effect&#8217;</a>: more efficient energy usage just makes people use more energy.  He also <a href="http://www.todayonline.com/Singapore/EDC101102-0000070/Making-the-right-energy-choice">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;At present, we don&#8217;t have a carbon tax, but we calculate a shadow price for carbon in our cost-benefit analysis so that Government policies and decision making can be better-informed and rational.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, he said, if an agreement is not reached, uncertainty will continue to prevail about when the problem of global warming will finally be addressed.  Given this, he said, Singapore supports the goal of reaching an agreement.  He explicitly noted that this was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">&#8216;commons&#8217;</a> problem: every individual nation stands to benefit by being the only one who continues to burn lots of carbon, but if every nation does this, the world will be harmed.  </p>
<p>He was not optimistic about an agreement being reached in Cancún; he mentioned how Obama had begun his term in office strongly supporting climate change legislation, but was unable to stick with this intention.  Nonetheless, he seemed to indicate that a price on carbon was inevitable in the long term.</p>
<p>He discussed three main ways to reduce carbon usage: </p>
<p>1) switching to sustainable forms of energy production like solar, wind and hydropower, </p>
<p>2) technologies such as carbon sequestration and nuclear power, and </p>
<p>3) conservation.  </p>
<p>He said that Singapore is &#8220;an alternative energy-disadvantaged country&#8221;, so option 1) is limited.  He explicitly mentioned that most sustainable forms of energy have a low <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Power+density">&#8216;power density&#8217;</a>, and again his correct use of jargon pleased me.  He said that even if every building in Singapore was covered with solar cells, that would only generate 10% of the necessary power.  </p>
<p>He <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1090640/1/.html">said</a> that the use of nuclear power was an option one cannot afford to dismiss:</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;There is often strong resistance in countries &#8211; from the green movement, from populations who have witnessed accidents like Chernobyl, and are fearful and anxious about their safety. But if we look at this rationally, without nuclear energy, the world cannot make sufficient progress in dealing with global warming&#8221;.
</p></blockquote>
<p>He pointed out that America is beginning to build more nuclear plants, and that Angela Merkel, despite great pressure from the Greens, had put off the closure of such plants in Germany.  He said that more plants would eventually be built in Germany, even though it&#8217;s &#8220;unspeakable&#8221; now.  </p>
<p>He argued that it is important to start moving forward on this issue, even in a small state like Singapore where any nuclear plant would necessarily be close to densely populated areas.  The crucial first step, he said, is to develop the technical know-how and the necessary &#8220;culture of safety&#8221;.  When the moderator asked him whether nuclear power would be introduced during his time in office, he <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_598218.html">replied</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;I would say possibly during my lifetime.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>He also spent a lot of time discussing option 3), energy conservation.  He said Singapore has a pilot program for a &#8220;smart grid&#8221; that lets households see how they&#8217;re using electrical power, and if this turns out to increase their efficiency, this would be adopted more widely.</p>
<p>All in all, an interesting talk.</p>

				<h2><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/10/27/energy-return-on-energy-invested/" rel="bookmark">Energy Return on Energy&nbsp;Invested</a></h2>
				<small>27 October, 2010</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>The <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/HomePage">Azimuth Project</a> wiki has been up and running for exactly one month!  </p>
<p>We&#8217;ve built up a nice bunch of articles sketching some of the biggest environmental problems we face today &mdash; and some ideas for dealing with them.   I invite you to look these over and <i>improve them!</i>  It&#8217;s very easy to do. </p>
<p>I also invite you to join us at the <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Azimuth+Forum">Azimuth Forum</a>, where we are deciding the fate of humanity (or something like that).  We need your help!</p>
<p>In the weeks to come I want to tell you what we&#8217;ve learned so far.  I especially want to talk about various <i>plans of action</i> that people have formulated to tackle global warming.   Even sitting here in the comfort of this cozy blog, you can help us compare and criticize these plans.</p>
<p>But I also want to tell you about some interesting concepts. And the first is <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/EROEI">EROEI</a>, or &#8220;Energy Return On Energy Invested&#8221;.  The Azimuth Project entry on this concept was largely written by David Tweed. <i>Three cheers for David Tweed!</i> <img src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/emoticons/thumbsup.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>It also had help from Eric Forgy, Graham Jones and David Pollard, and a major contribution from Anonymous Coward.  I&#8217;ll shorten it and amp it up for the purposes of this blog.  I know you&#8217;re here to be entertained.</p>
<h4>The Idea</h4>
<p>You&#8217;ve probably heard the saying &#8220;it takes money to make money&#8221;.  Similarly, it takes energy to make energy.  More precisely, it takes <i>useful</i> energy to make <i>useful</i> energy.   </p>
<p><b>Energy Returned On Energy Invested</b> or <b>EROEI</b> captures this idea: it&#8217;s simply the ratio of &#8220;useful energy acquired&#8221; to &#8220;useful energy expended&#8221;. Note that <i>money</i> does not enter into this concept.  The difficult and often heated debate arises when we try to decide which inputs and outputs count as &#8220;useful&#8221;. </p>
<p>There are other names for this concept and closely related concepts.   &#8220;Energy profit ratio&#8221;, &#8220;surplus energy&#8221;, &#8220;energy gain&#8221;, and &#8220;EROI&#8221;, and EROEI all describe virtually the same idea: how much energy we receive per energy put in.  See: </p>
<p>&bull; Nate Hagen, <a href="//www.theoildrum.com/story/2006/8/2/114144/2387">A Net Energy Parable: Why is ERoEI Important?</a>, <i>The Oil Drum</i>, 2006.</p>
<p>The concept of &#8220;energy yield ratio&#8221; is also very similar, but tends to be used in slightly different ways.  See the <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/EROEI">Azimuth Project article</a> for more.</p>
<h4>Details</h4>
<p>The definition of EROEI for a process of &#8220;extracting energy&#8221;<br />
is the <i>useful acquired energy</i> divided by the <i>useful energy expended</i>. The &#8220;useful&#8221; tag denotes energy which is usable by human beings now.  For example: a supernova wastes a lot of energy in the process of making uranium and blasting it out into space.  But that was done long before we came along, so it makes no sense to include it in the EROEI inputs.  </p>
<p>In practice, people include inputs and outputs that aren&#8217;t strictly &#8220;energies&#8221;, but rather &#8220;substances from which energy can be extracted&#8221;.  For example: one could look at the EROEI of growing trees for fuel, where the wood produced is counted as an output according to the energy extractable by burning.</p>
<p>In general, having a high EROEI value counts as &#8220;good&#8221;. Indeed, when the EROEI drops below 1 more energy is being used in the extraction process than is being output at the end! But because it only considers energy issues (and not resource scarcity, scalability, pollution, etc.), EROEI should only be one input into our process of deciding on technologies and actions.</p>
<p>When it comes to computing EROEI, the hard part is deciding which inputs and outputs should be included in the ratio &mdash; particularly since this involves considering which other competing processes are genuinely viable. </p>
<p>Another complication is that while various forms of energy can generally be converted to each other, this will incur losses due to conversion inefficiencies. So, you can&#8217;t look at two schemes with the same useful energy inputs that produce different kinds of energy &mdash; e.g., electricity and heat &mdash; and declare the one with the higher EROEI as more suitable.</p>
<h4>Examples</h4>
<p>To see some of the difficulties in calculating an EROEI, let&#8217;s imagine growing a crop of grass and then fermenting it to produce a liquid fuel.  The most obvious inputs and outputs are:</p>
<p>&#8220;Energy&#8221; outputs:</p>
<p>1. The liquid fuel itself. This is unarguably useful output &#8220;energy&#8221;.</p>
<p>2. There may be excess heat produced by the fermentation process. Whether this is useful is debatable since the energy is of high entropy and produced at plants located away from energy consumers.</p>
<p>3. The remaining biomass may be suitable for burning. Again the usefulness is debatable, since the biomass may be better used for fertilising the fields used to grow the crop.  Even if this isn&#8217;t the case, the biomass may require yet more energy to collect into a dry, burnable state. </p>
<p>&#8220;Energy&#8221; inputs:</p>
<p>1. Sunlight. Except for exceptional circumstances, there is no other use for sunlight falling on fields so this does not count as a useful input.</p>
<p>2. Artificial fertilizer. This requires energy to produce and could be used for growing food or other crops, so it definitely counts as a useful energy input.</p>
<p>3. Energy used by motorized vehicles, both during farming and transportation to the biomass plant. For the same reasons as fertilizer, this counts as a useful energy input.</p>
<p>4. Mechanical energy used to extract liquid fuel after fermentation and clear waste products from the apparatus.  Again a useful energy input.</p>
<p>Thus one computation of EROEI would count outputs 1 and inputs 2, 3 and 4. </p>
<p>However, suppose that the grass crop is <i>genuinely</i> being grown for other reasons &mdash; e.g., as part of a crop rotation scheme &mdash; and the plant is sufficiently small that the excess heat can be used fully by the plant for staff heating. Then you could argue that the EROEI should count outputs 1 and 2 and count inputs 3 and 4.  So, to determine the EROEI you need to decide which alternative uses are genuinely viable.</p>
<p>Note also that this EROEI calculation is purely about energy!  It does not reflect issues such as whether the land usage is sustainable, possible soil depletion/erosion, scarcity of mineral inputs for artificial fertilizer, etc.</p>
<h4>Comparison</h4>
<p>Okay, but enough of these nuances and caveats.  Important as they are, I know what you really want: a list of different forms of energy and their EROEI&#8217;s! </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Natural gas: 10:1<br />
Coal: 50:1<br />
Oil (Ghawar supergiant field): 100:1<br />
Oil (global average): 19:1<br />
Tar sands: 5.2:1 to 5.8:1<br />
Oil shale: 1.5:1 to 4:1</p>
<p>Wind: 18:1<br />
Hydro: 11:1 to 267:1<br />
Waves: 15:1<br />
Tides: ~ 6:1<br />
Geothermal power: 2:1 to 13:1<br />
Solar photovoltaic power: 3.75:1 to 10:1<br />
Solar thermal: 1.6:1</p>
<p>Nuclear power: 1.1:1 to 15:1</p>
<p>Biodiesel: 1.9:1 to 9:1<br />
Ethanol: 0.5:1 to 8:1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This list comes from:</p>
<p>&bull; Richard Heinberg, <a href="http://richardheinberg.com/searching-for-a-miracle"><i>Searching for a Miracle: ‘Net Energy’ Limits &amp; the Fate of Industrial Society</i></a>.</p>
<p>You can read this report for more details on how he computed these numbers.  If you&#8217;re like me, you&#8217;ll take a perverse interest in forms of energy production with the <i>lowest</i> EROEIs.  For example, what idiot would make ethanol in a way that yields only <i>half as much useful energy as it takes to make the stuff?</i>   </p>
<p>The US government, that&#8217;s who: the powerful <a href="http://sugarcaneblog.com/2010/07/22/corn-lobby-has-dire-warning-for-loss-of-ethanol-subsidy/">corn lobby</a> has been getting subsidies for some highly inefficient forms of biofuel!    But things vary a lot from place to place: corn grows better in the heart of the corn belt (like Iowa) than near the edges (like Texas).  So, the production of a bushel of corn in Iowa costs 43 megajoules of energy on average, while in Texas it costs 71 megajoules.  </p>
<p>Similar, ethanol from sugar cane in Brazil has an EROEI of 8:1 to 10:1, but when made from Louisiana sugar cane in the United States, the EROEI is closer to 1:1.</p>
<p>&#8220;Solar thermal&#8221; also comes out looking bad in the table above, with an EROEI of just 1.6:1.  But what&#8217;s &#8220;solar thermal&#8221;?  Heinberg has a section on &#8220;active&#8221; or &#8220;concentrating&#8221; solar thermal power, where you focus sunlight to heat a liquid to drive a turbine.  He also has one on &#8220;passive&#8221; solar, where you heat your house, or water, by sun falling on it.  But he doesn&#8217;t give EROEI&#8217;s in either of these sections &mdash; unlike the sections on other forms of energy.  So I can&#8217;t see where this figure of 1.6 is coming from.</p>
<p>Anyway, there&#8217;s a lot to think about here.  Each one of the numbers listed above could serve as the starting-point for a fascinating discussion!  Let&#8217;s start&#8230;</p>

				<h2><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/10/05/power-density/" rel="bookmark">Power Density</a></h2>
				<small>5 October, 2010</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>Today I&#8217;ve been thinking about &#8220;power density&#8221;, and I&#8217;ve got some questions for you.</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s start at the beginning!</p>
<p>In his 2009 talk at the Long Now Foundation, the engineer <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Saul+Griffith">Saul Griffith</a> made some claims that fill me with intense dread.   Stewart Brand summarized the talk as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p> The world currently runs on about 16 terawatts (trillion watts) of energy, most of it burning fossil fuels. To level off at 450 ppm of carbon dioxide, we will have to reduce the fossil fuel burning to 3 terawatts and produce all the rest with renewable energy, and we have to do it in 25 years or it&#8217;s too late. Currently about half a terrawatt comes from clean hydropower and one terrawatt from clean nuclear. That leaves 11.5 terawatts to generate from new clean sources.</p>
<p>That would mean the following. (Here I&#8217;m drawing on notes and extrapolations I&#8217;ve written up previously from discussion with Griffith):</p>
<p>&#8220;Two terawatts of photovoltaic would require installing 100 square meters of 15-percent-efficient solar cells every second, second after second, for the next 25 years. (That&#8217;s about 1,200 square miles of solar cells a year, times 25 equals 30,000 square miles of photovoltaic cells.) Two terawatts of solar thermal? If it&#8217;s 30 percent efficient all told, we&#8217;ll need 50 square meters of highly reflective mirrors every second. (Some 600 square miles a year, times 25.) Half a terawatt of biofuels? Something like one Olympic swimming pools of genetically engineered algae, installed every second. (About 15,250 square miles a year, times 25.) Two terawatts of wind? That&#8217;s a 300-foot-diameter wind turbine every 5 minutes. (Install 105,000 turbines a year in good wind locations, times 25.) Two terawatts of geothermal? Build 3 100-megawatt steam turbines every day &mdash; 1,095 a year, times 25. Three terawatts of new nuclear? That&#8217;s a 3-reactor, 3-gigawatt plant every week &mdash; 52 a year, times 25&#8221;.</p>
<p>In other words, the land area dedicated to renewable energy (&#8220;Renewistan&#8221;) would occupy a space about the size of Australia to keep the carbon dioxide level at 450 ppm. To get to Hansen&#8217;s goal of 350 ppm of carbon dioxide, fossil fuel burning would have to be cut to ZERO, which means another 3 terawatts would have to come from renewables, expanding the size of Renewistan further by 26 percent.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The main scary part is the astounding magnitude of this project, and how far we are from doing anything remotely close.  Griffith describes it as not like the Manhattan Project, but like World War II &mdash; only with everyone on the same side.</p>
<p>But another scary part is the amount of land that needs to get devoted to &#8220;Renewistan&#8221; in this scheme. This is where power density comes in.</p>
<p>The term <b>power density</b> is used in various ways, but in the work of <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Vaclav+Smil">Vaclav Smil</a> it means the number of usable watts that can be produced per square meter of land (or water) by a given technology, and that&#8217;s how I&#8217;ll use it here.  </p>
<p>Smil&#8217;s main point is that renewable forms of energy generally have a much lower power density than fossil fuels.  As Griffith points out, this could have massive effects.   Or consider the plan for England, Scotland and Wales on <a href="http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/withouthotair/c28/page_215.shtml">page 215</a> of <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/David+MacKay">David MacKay</a>&#8216;s book <i>Without the Hot Air</i>:</p>

<p>That&#8217;s a lot of land devoted to energy production!</p>
<p>Smil wrote an interesting paper about power density:</p>
<p>&bull; Vaclav Smil, <a href="http://www.vaclavsmil.com/wp-content/uploads/docs/smil-article-power-density-primer.pdf">Power density primer: understanding the spatial dimension of the unfolding transition to renewable electricity generation</a></p>
<p>In it, he writes:</p>
<blockquote><p> Energy density is easy – power density is confusing.
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p> One look at energy densities of common fuels is enough to understand while we prefer coal over wood and oil over coal: air-dried wood is, at best, 17 MJ/kg, good-quality bituminous coal is 22-25 MJ/kg, and refined oil products are around 42 MJ/kg. And a comparison of volumetric energy densities makes it clear why shipping non-compressed, non-liquefied natural gas would never work while shipping crude oil is cheap: natural gas rates around 35 MJ/m<sup>3</sup>, crude oil has around 35 GJ/m<sup>3</sup> and hence its volumetric energy density is a thousand times (three orders of magnitude) higher. An obvious consequence: without liquefied (or at least compressed) natural gas there can be no intercontinental shipments of that clean fuel.
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>
Power density is a much more complicated variable. Engineers have used power densities as revealing measures of performance for decades – but several specialties have defined them in their own particular ways&#8230;.
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p> For the past 25 years I have favored a different, and a much broader, measure of power density as perhaps the most universal measure of energy flux: W/m<sup>2</sup> of horizontal area of land or water surface rather than per unit of the working surface of a converter.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Here are some of his results:</p>
<p>&bull; No other mode of large-scale electricity generation occupies as little space as gas turbines: besides their compactness they do not need fly ash disposal or flue gas desulfurization. Mobile gas turbines generate electricity with power densities <b>higher than 15,000 W/m<sup>2</sup></b> and large (&gt;100 MW) stationary set-ups can easily deliver <b>4,000-5,000 W/m<sup>2</sup></b>.  (What about the area needed for mining?)</p>
<p>&bull; Most large modern coal-fired power plants generate electricity with power densities ranging from <b>100 to 1,000 W/m<sup>2</sup></b>, including the area of the mine, the power plant, etcetera.</p>
<p>&bull; Concentrating solar power (CSP) projects use tracking parabolic mirrors in order to reflect and concentrate solar radiation on a central receiver placed in a high tower, for the purposes of powering a steam engine.  All facilities included, these deliver at most <b>10 W/m<sup>2</sup></b>.</p>
<p>&bull; Photovoltaic panels are fixed in an optimal tilted south-facing position and hence receive more radiation than a unit of horizontal surface, but the average power densities of solar parks are low.  Additional land is needed for spacing the panels for servicing, access roads, inverter and transformer facilities and service structures &mdash; and only  85% of a panel’s DC rating is transmitted from the park to the grid as AC power.  All told, they deliver <b>4-9 W/m<sup>2</sup></b>.</p>
<p>&bull; Wind turbines have fairly high power densities when the rate measures the flux of wind’s kinetic energy moving through the working surface: the area swept by blades.  This power density is commonly above 400 W/m<sup>2</sup> &mdash; but power density expressed as electricity generated per land area is much less!   At best we can expect a peak power of 6.6 W/m<sup>2</sup> and even a relatively high average capacity factor of 30% would bring that down to only about <b>2 W/m<sup>2</sup>.</b></p>
<p>&bull; The energy density of dry wood (18-21 GJ/ton) is close to that of sub-bituminous coal. But if we were to supply a significant share of a nation’s electricity from wood we would have to establish extensive tree plantations.  We could not expect harvests surpassing 20 tons/hectare, with 10 tons/hectare being more typical. Harvesting all above-ground tree mass and feeding it into chippers would allow for 95% recovery of the total field production, but even if the fuel’s average energy density were 19 GJ/ton, the plantation would yield no more than 190 GJ/hectare, resulting in harvest power density of <b>0.6 W/m<sup>2</sup></b>.</p>
<p>Of course, power density is of limited value in making decisions regarding power generation, because:</p>
<p>1. The price of a square meter of land or water varies vastly depending on its location.</p>
<p>2. Using land for one purpose does not always prevent its use for others: e.g. solar panels on roofs, crops or solar panels between wind turbines.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Smil&#8217;s basic point, that most forms of renewable forms of energy will require us to devote larger areas of the Earth to energy production, seems fairly robust.   (An arguable exception is breeder reactors, which in conjunction with extracting uranium from seawater might be considered a form of renewable energy.   This is important.)</p>
<p>On the other hand, fans of solar energy argue that much smaller areas would be needed to supply the world&#8217;s power.  There are two possible reasons, and I haven&#8217;t sorted them out yet:</p>
<p>1) They may be talking about <i>electrical</i> power, which is roughly one order of magnitude less than <i>total</i> power usage.</p>
<p>2) As Smil&#8217;s calculations show, solar power allows for significantly greater power density than wind or biofuels.  Griffith&#8217;s area for &#8216;Renewistan&#8217; may be large because it includes a significant amount of power from those other sources.  </p>
<p>What do you folks think?  I&#8217;ve got a lot of questions:</p>
<p>&bull; what&#8217;s the power density for nuclear power?</p>
<p>&bull; what&#8217;s the power density for sea-based wind farms?</p>
<p>and some harder ones, like:</p>
<p>&bull; how useful is the concept of power density?</p>
<p>&bull; how much land area would be devoted to power production in a well-crafted carbon-neutral economy?</p>
<p>and that perennial favorite:</p>
<p>&bull; what am I ignoring that I should be thinking about?</p>
<p>If Saul Griffith&#8217;s calculations are wrong, and keeping the world from exceeding 450 ppm of CO<sub>2</sub> is easier than he thinks, we need to know!</p>

				<small>3 September, 2010</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>Physicists love a good &#8216;back-of-the-envelope calculation&#8217;: a quick calculation that lets you roughly estimate something.  The goal is not precision: you&#8217;re doing fine if you come within a factor of 10 of the right answer.   Instead, the goal is a kind of rough preliminary insight.  After all, if you can&#8217;t figure out the answer <i>roughly</i>, you probably shouldn&#8217;t charge ahead with calculations that claim to get the answer <i>accurately</i>.    </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a guest post by Charlie Clingen.  It&#8217;s a back-of-the-envelope calculation that tackles this question: </p>
<p><b>If we kept using electricity at a constant rate, how long would today’s uranium supply last if the world switched overnight to generating all electrical power with today’s nuclear technology?</b>  </p>
<p>His answer: <b>10 years</b>.</p>
<p>Your first reaction may be a howl of indignation.  After all, you&#8217;ve probably seen drastically longer times mentioned as answers to this question&#8230; or&#8230; umm&#8230; at least <i>similar-sounding</i> questions.   For example, read:</p>
<p>&bull; Martin Sevior, <a href="http://www.theoildrum.com/node/2323">Is nuclear power a viable option for our energy needs?</a>, <i>The Oil Drum</i>, March 1, 2007.</p>
<p>He says &#8220;unlike conventional oil, uranium resource exhaustion will not be an issue for the foreseeable future&#8221;.  And he shows a truly heart-warming graph by M. King Hubbert, who is famous for his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_oil">&#8216;peak oil&#8217;</a> theory:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://www.hubbertpeak.com/hubbert/1956/1956.pdf"><br />
<img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.theoildrum.com/uploads/HubbertNuclear.png" /><br />
</a>
</div>
<p>So maybe Clingen&#8217;s answer is way off.   It certainly involves a lot of simplifying assumptions that are <b>clearly unrealistic</b>.  But because these assumptions are <b>clearly stated</b>, we can change them and see how the answer changes.   </p>
<p>For example, his calculation assumes that the world has about 5 million tonnes of uranium ready and waiting to be mined and refined for a reasonable cost.  This comes from the Red Book, put out by the International Atomic Energy Agency.  But the Red Book also says that over 35 million tons could be lurking around somewhere if we&#8217;re clever enough to find it.  If you&#8217;re willing to go with that higher figure, just multiply Charlie&#8217;s answer by 7.  The new answer: <b>70 years</b>.  Of course, this neglects the fact that electricity usage may go up.</p>
<p>So, please take this in the right spirit: it&#8217;s not supposed to be a definitive answer, just a starting-point for more detailed work. Criticism is cheap: see if you can do better.  I would love it if you did some more detailed and realistic calculations!   </p>
<p>Indeed, I&#8217;m eager to get more &#8216;guest posts&#8217; of many kinds here on Azimuth.  The first, Terry Bollinger&#8217;s post on <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/07/22/turning-renewable-energy-into-fuels/">turning renewable energy into fuels</a>, led to a great discussion that taught us a lot about this issue.  Greg Egan&#8217;s <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/08/24/probability-puzzles-from-egan/">Probability Puzzles</a> were a fun way to sharpen our understanding of probability theory.  Keep &#8217;em coming!</p>
<p>But on with the show&#8230;</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Question</b></p>
<p>If we kept using electricity at a constant rate, how long would today’s uranium supply last if the world switched overnight to generating all electrical power with today’s nuclear technology?</p>
<p><b>Objective</b></p>
<p>The goal is to get a rough estimate of how long currently known reserves of uranium will suffice to provide nuclear power, using today’s technologies, to satisfy all electrical power requirements, worldwide, at today’s level of consumption.</p>
<p>We consider a highly simplified base case using as inputs today’s known uranium reserves, today’s nuclear power technologies, and today’s total world-wide power requirements. This base case, although totally unrealistic, can be refined in a controlled, step-by-step fashion by easing restrictions and revising assumptions in ways that highlight major areas needing further investigation. Because this toy model requires only four inputs and yields a single output, it is easy to quickly test various hypothetical situations with mental or back-of-the-envelope computations, thereby easily achieving an intuitive understanding of the various critical assumptions, requirements, and issues involved.</p>
<p>The framework used here could easily be refined and extended to build a more useful model with multiple input parameters providing realistic and useful outputs.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of assumptions and restrictions recognized here: </p>
<p>1) Known assumptions and restrictions used to compute this rough estimate. These will be listed. </p>
<p>2) Unknown assumptions that are hidden in data taken from various sources. It is best to assume that all input data are inaccurate. Whenever possible, assumptions used to compute the values of input data should be discovered and stated. </p>
<p>All the technology, estimation, science, costing etc. details are hidden in the assumptions. The real difficulties in achieving a reasonable understanding of this problem are all buried in the assumptions.</p>
<p>When possible, the sensitivity of the results upon various assumptions should be made explicit.</p>
<p><b>Results</b></p>
<p>Under the assumptions stated below, using the most conservative values and assuming that cited inputs are reasonably accurate, the current uranium supply would be depleted in about ten years (9.6 – 11.2 years).</p>
<p>Using a less conservative estimate for the known world-wide uranium reserve, the current uranium supply would be depleted in about 70 years.</p>
<h4>Assumptions</h4>
<p>There are many known assumptions underlying the calculation:</p>
<p>1. It is assumed that the changeover to nuclear power, supplying the total world-wide requirements for electrical power, will occur instantaneously &mdash; instant power plant construction, instant fuel availability, etc. Nuclear power replaces carbon-based power generation, hydroelectric power, wind power, etcetera. <b>This is the most extreme assumption.</b></p>
<p>2. All costs are assumed to be unchanging and irrelevant. One exception: the total known uranium reserves estimates of 4.7 – 5.5 million tonnes are those that can now be mined at a price of US$ 130 per kilogram.</p>
<p>3. Total known reserves of uranium are assumed to be fixed. Even the “currently known” values which were used are dependent on numerous assumptions and predictions.   </p>
<p>4. Mining and processing (cost, capacity, and time) of uranium is assumed not to be a limiting factor. Processed uranium fuel is assumed to be available as soon as needed.</p>
<p>5. Annual worldwide consumption of electrical power is assumed to be fixed at “today’s” rate. No population growth, no increased power requirements.</p>
<p>6. Power generation technology and efficiency are assumed to be fixed at today’s levels.  </p>
<p>7.  Note also that the calculation only concerns uranium, not thorium.</p>
<p>There are also unknown assumptions: </p>
<p>1. The estimates for total known uranium reserves world-wide are highly variable and based on assumptions that are not evaluated here. </p>
<p>2. The estimates of power production efficiency are also based on assumptions not evaluated here.  Breeder reactor technology, if feasible for wide-scale deployment, might vastly improve efficiency.</p>
<p>3.  The estimate of current-day worldwide total electricity consumption is also based on assumptions not evaluated here.</p>
<p>4. There must be further implicit assumptions that we have overlooked.</p>
<h4>
Analysis<br />
</h4>
<p>The number of years that available reserves of uranium will support “today’s” worldwide electric power consumption is given by:</p>
<div align="center">
T = U &times; (E/U) / (E/T)
</div>
<p>where</p>
<p>T = time for which world-wide supply of uranium will last</p>
<p>U = total known reserves of uranium</p>
<p>E/U = terawatt-hours of electricity generated per (metric) tonne of uranium</p>
<p>E/T = terawatt-hours of electricity consumed per year world-wide</p>
<p>This gives:</p>
<p>T = (4.7 – 5.5 million tonnes) &times; (38,750 TWh/million tonnes) / (19,000 TWh/year) </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;    = 9.6 – 11.2 years</p>
<p>Note. To get a less conservative estimate, using the value of 35 million tonnes for the total uranium reserve, as opposed to the 4.7 – 5.5 million tonne value, we can simply multiply our result by 7.  Then</p>
<p>T = 10 years &times; 7 = 70 years</p>
<p>Similarly, if average power generation efficiency were assumed to double (instantaneously) we could multiply the result by 2; if world-wide power demand were to double, we could divide the result by 2. And if  we were to ramp up any or all of the factors over a period of  time &mdash; for example, if power production were to ramp up linearly over a period of 50 years, rather than instantaneously &mdash; a simple multiplicative factor can be computed to adjust the final result, D. In short, it is quite easy to do simple sensitivity analyses and to adjust results based on changes to input assumptions.</p>
<h4>Estimates for U, E/U, and E/T</h4>
<p><b>U: total uranium reserves, in tonnes</b></p>
<p>Here we have two different estimates:</p>
<p>U = 4.7 – 5.5 million tonnes, or 35 million tonnes.</p>
<p>Sources: an International Atomic Energy Agency report from June, 2006:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/News/2006/uranium_resources.html">Uranium 2005: Resources, Production and Demand</a>.</p>
<p>also called the &#8220;Red Book&#8221;, estimates the total identified amount of conventional uranium stock, which can be mined for less than USD 130 per kg, to be about 4.7 million tonnes.  This number was made for 2005; underlying assumptions unknown. </p>
<p>The 2007 Red Book estimate was 5.5 million tonnes:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.nea.fr/press/2008/2008-02.html">Uranium 2007: Resources, Production and Demand</a>.</p>
<p>This book estimates the identified amount of conventional uranium resources which can be mined for less than US$ 130/kg to be about 5.5 million tonnes, up from the 4.7 million tonnes reported in 2005. Undiscovered resources, i.e. uranium deposits that can be expected to be found based on the geological characteristics of already discovered resources, have also risen to 10.5 million tonnes. This is an increase of 0.5 million tonnes compared to the previous edition of the report. The increases are due to both new discoveries and re-evaluations of known resources, encouraged by higher prices.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that the <a href="http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/News/2006/uranium_resources.html">2006 Red Book</a> says: &#8220;However, world uranium resources in total are considered to be much higher. Based on geological evidence and knowledge of uranium in phosphates the study considers more than 35 million tonnes is available for exploitation.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>E/U: energy per tonne of uranium</b></p>
<p>Estimate: </p>
<p>E/U = (2,558 TWh/year) / (0.066 million tonnes/year) =   38,760 TWh/million tonnes</p>
<p>Source: </p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.nea.fr/press/2008/2008-02.html">Press release by OECD Nuclear Energy Agency</a>, June 3, 2008.</p>
<p>which says:</p>
<blockquote><p>
At the end of 2006, world uranium production (39 603 tonnes) provided about 60% of world reactor requirements (66 500 tonnes) for the 435 commercial nuclear reactors in operation. The gap between production and requirements was made up by secondary sources drawn from government and commercial inventories (such as the dismantling of over 12 000 nuclear warheads and the re-enrichment of uranium tails). Most secondary resources are now in decline and the gap will increasingly need to be closed by new production.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The 2009 estimate for nuclear power generation is given as 2,558 TWh (terawatt-hours) (see below).</p>
<p>Comparison: an <a href="http://web.ead.anl.gov/uranium/guide/facts/">unsourced webpage at the Argonne National Labs</a> says: &#8220;One ton of natural uranium can produce more than 40 million kilowatt-hours of electricity.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is roughly consistent with the 38,760 TWh/million tons used here.</p>
<p><b>E/T: Worldwide electrical power usage, in terawatt-hours/year</b></p>
<p>Estimate: </p>
<p>E/T = 19,000 TWh/year</p>
<p>Source: </p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/newsarticle.aspx?id=27665&amp;terms=another+drop+">World Nuclear News</a>, May 5, 2010.</p>
<p>states that last year, nuclear power generated 2,558 TWh of electricity, comprising 13-14% of the world’s electricity demand. This suggests an annual world-wide rate of total electricity consumption in 2009 of around 19,000 TWh.</p>
<p>Thus the total world-wide electrical energy consumption for 2009 was estimated (by this source) at 19,000 terrawatt-hours, corresponding to a <i>power</i> consumption rate of 19,000 terrawatt-hours/year.</p>
<p>Also, the nuclear power generated in 2009 was estimated at 2,558 TWh (terawatt-hours).</p>
<p>Comparison: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_electricity_consumption">Wikipedia</a> lists information from the US Energy Information Administration saying the total electrical power usage in 2007 was 17,100 TWh/year.  This is roughly consistent with the above value of 19,000 TWh.</p>
<hr />
<p>Hi, it&#8217;s John again.  I don&#8217;t like &#8220;terawatt-hours per year&#8221; since this unit of power is not part of the standard metric system, like &#8220;watts&#8221; or &#8220;terawatts&#8221;.  So let me express Clingen&#8217;s assumptions in metric:</p>
<p>U = 4.7 – 5.5 million tonnes, or 35 million tonnes, depending on assumptions.</p>
<p>E/T = 2.1 terawatts</p>
<p>E/U = 140 terajoules / tonne = 140 gigajoules / kilogram</p>
<p>By the way, because I spent a lot of time doing pure mathematics, you should <i>not trust my ability to multiply numbers correctly</i>.  Check my work &mdash; and Charlie Clingen&#8217;s, too.</p>

				<small>27 August, 2010</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>The first 300 issues of This Week&#8217;s Finds were devoted to the beauty of math and physics. Now I want to bite off a bigger chunk of reality.  I want to talk about all sorts of things, but especially <em>how scientists can help save the planet</em>.  I&#8217;ll start by interviewing some scientists with different views on the challenges we face &mdash; including some who started out in other fields, because I&#8217;m trying to make that transition myself.</p>
<p>By the way: I know &#8220;save the planet&#8221; sounds pompous.  As George Carlin joked: &#8220;Save the planet?  There&#8217;s nothing wrong with the planet.  The planet is fine.  The <em>people</em> are screwed.&#8221;  (He actually put it a bit more <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eScDfYzMEEw&amp;feature=player_embedded">colorfully</a>.)</p>
<p>But I believe it&#8217;s more accurate when he says:</p>
<blockquote><p>
I think, to be fair, the planet probably sees us as a mild threat. Something to be dealt with. And I am sure the planet will defend itself in the manner of a large organism, like a beehive or an ant colony, and muster a defense.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I think we&#8217;re annoying the biosphere.  I&#8217;d like us to become less annoying, both for its sake and our own.  I actually considered using the slogan <i>how scientists can help humans be less annoying</i> &mdash; but my advertising agency ran a focus group, and they picked <i>how scientists can help save the planet</i>.</p>
<p>Besides interviewing people, I want to talk about where we stand on various issues, and what scientists can do.  It&#8217;s a very large task, so I&#8217;m really hoping lots of you reading this will help out.  You can explain stuff, correct mistakes, and point me to good sources of information.  With a lot of help from Andrew Stacey, I&#8217;m starting a wiki where we can collect these pointers.  I&#8217;m hoping it will grow into something interesting.</p>
<p>But today I&#8217;ll start with a brief overview, just to get things rolling.  </p>
<p>In case you haven&#8217;t noticed: we&#8217;re heading for trouble in a number of ways. Our last two centuries were dominated by rapid technology change and a rapidly soaring population:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/diary/population-graph.jpg" />
</div>
<p>The population is <a href="http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/idb/worldpopgraph.php">still climbing fast</a>, though the percentage increase per year is <a href="http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/idb/worldgrgraph.php">dropping</a>.  Energy consumption per capita is also rising.  So, from 1980 to 2007 the world-wide usage of power <a href="http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/iedindex3.cfm?tid=44&amp;pid=44&amp;aid=2&amp;cid=&amp;syid=1980&amp;eyid=2007&amp;unit=QBTU">soared from 10 to 16 terawatts</a>.  </p>
<p>96% of this power now comes from fossil fuels. So, we&#8217;re putting huge amounts of carbon dioxide into the air: <a href="http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/IEDIndex3.cfm?tid=90&amp;pid=44&amp;aid=8">30 billion metric tons in 2007</a>.  So, the carbon dioxide concentration of the atmosphere is rising at a rapid clip: from about 290 parts per million before the industrial revolution, to about 370 in the year 2000, to about 390 now:</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>But how much will they go up?  The ultimate amount of warming will largely depend on the total amount of carbon dioxide we put into the air. The research branch of the National Academy of Sciences recently put out a report on these issues:</p>
<p>&bull; National Research Council, <a href="http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12877"><i>Climate Stabilization Targets: Emissions, Concentrations, and Impacts over Decades to Millennia</i></a>, 2010.</p>
<p>Here are their estimates:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12877&amp;page=3"><br />
<img width="350" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/diary/CO2_temperature_relation.jpg" /><br />
</a></div>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>You&#8217;ll note there&#8217;s lots of uncertainty, but a rough rule of thumb is that each doubling of carbon dioxide will raise the temperature around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_sensitivity">3 degrees Celsius</a>.    Of course people love to argue about these things: you can find reasonable people who&#8217;ll give a number anywhere between 1.5 and 4.5 &deg;C, and unreasonable people who say practically anything.   We&#8217;ll get into this later, I&#8217;m sure.</p>
<p>But anyway: if we keep up &#8220;business as usual&#8221;, it&#8217;s easy to imagine us doubling the carbon dioxide sometime this century, so we need to ask: what would a world 3 &deg;C warmer be like?  </p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t sound like much&#8230; until you realize that the Earth was only about 6 &deg;C colder during the last ice age, and the Antarctic had no ice the last time the Earth was about 4 &deg;C warmer.  You also need to bear in mind the shocking <i>suddenness</i> of the current rise in carbon dioxide levels:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://www.globalwarmingart.com/wiki/File:Carbon_Dioxide_400kyr_Rev_png"><br />

</a>
</div>
<p>You can see several ice ages here &mdash; or technically, &#8216;glacial periods&#8217;.  Carbon dioxide concentration and temperature go hand in hand, probably due to some feedback mechanisms that make each influence the other.  But the scary part is the vertical line on the right where the carbon dioxide shoots up from 290 to 390 parts per million &mdash; <i>instantaneously</i> from a geological point of view, and to levels not seen for a long time.   Species can adapt to slow climate changes, but we&#8217;re trying a radical experiment here.</p>
<p>But what, specifically, could be the effects of a world that&#8217;s 3 &deg;C warmer?  You can get some idea from the <a href="http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12877&amp;page=22">National Research Council report</a>.   Here are some of their predictions.  I think it&#8217;s important to read these, to see that <i>bad things will happen, but the world will not end</i>.  Psychologically, it&#8217;s easy to avoid taking action if you think there&#8217;s no problem &mdash; but it&#8217;s also easy if you think you&#8217;re doomed and there&#8217;s no point.  </p>
<p>Between their predictions (in boldface) I&#8217;ve added a few comments of my own.  These comments are not supposed to <i>prove</i> anything.  They&#8217;re just anecdotal examples of the kind of events the report says we should expect.</p>
<p>&bull; <b>For 3 &deg;C of global warming, 9 out of 10 northern hemisphere summers will be &#8220;exceptionally warm&#8221;: warmer in most land areas than all but about 1 of the summers from 1980 to 2000.</b></p>
<p>This summer has certainly been exceptionally warm: for example, worldwide, it was <a href="http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2010/20100715_globalstats.html">the hottest June in recorded history</a>, while <a href="http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2010/20100715_globalstats.html">July was the second hottest</a>, beat out only by 2003.  Temperature records have been <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=1544">falling like dominos</a>. This is a taste of the kind of thing we might see.</p>
<p>&bull; <b>Increases of precipitation at high latitudes and drying of the already semi-arid regions are projected with increasing global warming, with seasonal changes in several regions expected to be about 5-10% per degree of warming.  However, patterns of precipitation show much larger variability across models than patterns of temperature.</b></p>
<p>Back home in southern California we&#8217;re in our <a href="http://www.water.ca.gov/drought/docs/timeline-present.pdf">fourth year of drought</a>, which has led to many  <a href="http://www.miller-mccune.com/science-environment/drought-aiding-wildfires-3508/">wildfires</a>. </p>
<p>&bull; <b>Large increases in the area burned by wildfire are expected in parts of Australia, western Canada, Eurasia and the United States.</b></p>
<p>We are already getting some unusually intense fires: for example, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Saturday_bushfires">Black Saturday bushfires</a> that ripped through Victoria in February 2007, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Greek_forest_fires">massive fires in Greece</a> later that year, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Russian_wildfires">hundreds of wildfires that broke out in Russia this July</a>. </p>
<p>&bull; <b>Extreme precipitation events &mdash; that is, days with the top 15% of rainfall &mdash; are expected to increase by 3-10% per degree of warming.</b></p>
<p>The extent to which these events cause floods, and the extent to which these floods cause serious damage, will depend on many complex factors.  But today it hard not to think about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Pakistan_floods">floods in Pakistan</a>, which left about 20 million homeless, and ravaged an area equal to that of California.</p>
<p>&bull; <b>In many regions the amount of flow in streams and rivers is expected to change by 5-15% per degree of warming, with decreases in some areas and increases in others.</b></p>
<p>&bull; <b>The total number of tropical cyclones should decrease slightly or remain unchanged.  Their wind speed is expected to increase by 1-4% per degree of warming.</b></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a bit counterintuitive that warming could decrease the number of cyclones, while making them stronger.  I&#8217;ll have to learn more about this.</p>
<p>&bull; <b>The annual average sea ice area in the Arctic is expected to decrease by 15% per degree of warming, with more decrease in the summertime.</b></p>
<p>The area of Arctic ice <a href="http://nsidc.org/news/press/2007_seaiceminimum/20071001_pressrelease.html">reached a record low in the summer of 2007</a>, and the fabled Northwest Passage opened up for the first time in recorded history.  Then the ice area bounced back.  This year it was low again&#8230; but what matters more is the overall trend:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://nsidc.org/data/seaice_index/"><br />

</a></div>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>&bull; <b>Global sea level has risen by about 0.2 meters since 1870.  The sea level rise by 2100 is expected to be at least 0.6 meters due to thermal expansion and loss of ice from glaciers and small ice caps.   This could be enough to permanently displace as many as 3 million people &mdash; and raise the risk of floods for many millions more.  Ice loss is also occurring in parts of Greenland and Antarctica, but the effect  on sea level in the next century remains uncertain. </b></p>
<p>&bull; <b>Up to 2 degrees of global warming, studies suggest that crop yield gains and adaptation, especially at high latitudes, could balance losses in tropical and other regions.  Beyond 2 degrees, studies suggest a rise in food prices.</b></p>
<p>The first sentence there is the main piece of <i>good</i> news &mdash; though not if you&#8217;re a poor farmer in central Africa.</p>
<p>&bull; <b>Increased carbon dioxide also makes the ocean more acidic and lowers the ability of many organisms to make shells and skeleta.  Seashells, coral, and the like are made of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aragonite">aragonite</a>, one of the two crystal forms of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_carbonate">calcium carbonate</a>.  North polar surface waters will become under-saturated for aragonite if the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere rises to 400-450 parts per million.  Then aragonite will tend to dissolve, rather than form from seawater.  For south polar surface waters, this effect will occur at 500-660 ppm.  Tropical surface waters and deep ocean waters are expected to remain supersaturated for aragonite throughout the 20th century, but coral reefs may be negatively impacted.</b></p>
<p>Coral reefs are also <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/08/18/dying-coral-reefs/">having trouble</a> due to warming oceans.  For example,  this summer there was a <a href="http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/aug2010/2010-08-16-02.html">mass dieoff of corals</a> off the coast of Indonesia due to ocean temperatures that were 4 &deg;C higher than average.</p>
<p>&bull; <b>Species are moving toward the poles to keep cool: the average shift over many types of terrestrial species has been 6 kilometers per decade.  The rate of extinction of species will be enhanced by climate change.</b></p>
<p>I have a strong fondness for the diversity of animals and plants that grace this planet, so this particularly perturbs me.  The report does not venture a guess for how many species may go extinct due to climate change, probably because it&#8217;s hard to estimate.  However, it states that the extinction rate is now roughly 500 times what it was before humans showed up.  The extinction rate is measured  extinctions per million years per species.  For mammals, it&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12877&amp;page=200">shot up from roughly 0.1-0.5 to roughly 50-200.</a>  That&#8217;s what I call <i>annoying the biosphere!</i>  </p>
<p>So, that&#8217;s a brief summary of the problems that carbon dioxide emissions may cause.   There&#8217;s just one more thing I want to say about this now.</p>
<p>Once carbon dioxide is put into the atmosphere, about 50% of it will stay there for decades.   About 30% of it will stay there for centuries.  And about 20% will stay there for thousands of years:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://www.globalwarmingart.com/wiki/File:Carbon_Dioxide_Residence_Time_png"><br />
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature/Carbon_Dioxide_Adjustment_Time.jpg" /><br />
</a>
</div>
<p>This particular chart is based on some 1993 calculations by Wigley.  Later calculations confirm this idea: the carbon we burn will haunt our skies essentially forever:</p>
<p>&bull; Mason Inman, <a href="http://www.nature.com/climate/2008/0812/full/climate.2008.122.html">Carbon is forever</a>, <i>Nature Reports Climate Change</i>, 20 November 2008.</p>
<p><i>This is why we&#8217;re in serious trouble.</i>  In the above article, James Hansen puts it this way:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Because of this long CO<sub>2</sub> lifetime, we cannot solve the climate problem by slowing down emissions by 20% or 50% or even 80%. It does not matter much whether the CO<sub>2</sub> is emitted this year, next year, or several years from now.  Instead &#8230; we must identify a portion of the fossil fuels that will be left in the ground, or captured upon emission and put back into the ground.
</p></blockquote>
<p>But I think it&#8217;s important to be more precise.  We can <i>put off</i> global warming by reducing carbon dioxide emissions, and that may be a useful thing to do.  But to <i>prevent</i> it, we have to cut our usage of fossil fuels to a <i>very</i> small level long before we&#8217;ve used them up.  </p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://www.globalwarmingart.com/wiki/File:Carbon_Stabilization_Scenarios_png"><br />
<img src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature/Carbon_Stabilization_Scenarios.jpg" /><br />
</a>
</div>
<p>Theoretically, another option is to quickly deploy new technologies to suck carbon dioxide out of the air, or cool the planet in other ways.   But there&#8217;s almost no chance such technologies will be practical soon enough to <i>prevent</i> significant global warming.  They may become important later on, <i>after we&#8217;ve already screwed things up</i>.  We may be miserable enough to try them, even though they may carry significant risks of their own.</p>
<p>So now, some tough questions:</p>
<p><b>If we decide to cut our usage of fossil fuels dramatically and quickly, how can we do it?   How <i>should</i> we do it?  What&#8217;s the least painful way?  Or should we just admit that we&#8217;re doomed to global warming and learn to live with it, at least until we develop technologies to reverse it?</b></p>
<p>And a few more questions, just for completeness:</p>
<p><b>Could this all be just a bad dream &mdash; or more precisely, a delusion of some sort?   Could it be that everything is actually fine?  Or at least not as bad as you&#8217;re saying?</b></p>
<p>I won&#8217;t attempt to answer any of these now.  We&#8217;ll have to keep coming back to them, over and over.</p>
<p>So far I&#8217;ve only talked about carbon dioxide emissions.  There are lots of other problems we should tackle, too!   But presumably many of these are just symptoms of some deeper underlying problem.  What is this deeper problem?  I&#8217;ve been trying to figure that out for years.  Is there any way to summarize what&#8217;s going on, or it is just a big complicated mess? </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my attempt at a quick summary: the human race makes big decisions based on an economic model that ignores many negative externalities.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality#Negative">&#8216;negative externality&#8217;</a> is, very roughly, a way in which my actions impose a cost on you, for which I don&#8217;t pay any price.  </p>
<p>For example: suppose I live in a high-rise apartment and my toilet breaks.  Instead of fixing it, I realize that I can just use a bucket &mdash; and throw its contents out the window!   Whee!  If society has no mechanism for dealing with people like me, I pay no price for doing this.  But you, down there, will be very unhappy.  </p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t just theoretical.  Once upon a time in Europe there were few private toilets, and people would shout &#8220;gardyloo!&#8221; before throwing their waste down to the streets below.   In retrospect that seems disgusting, but many of the big problems that afflict us now can be seen as the result of equally disgusting externalities.  For example:</p>
<p>&bull; <b><a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/">Carbon dioxide pollution caused by burning fossil fuels.</a></b>  If the expected costs of global warming and ocean acidification were included in the price of fossil fuels, other sources of energy would more quickly become competitive.  This is the idea behind a carbon tax or a &#8216;cap-and-trade program&#8217; where companies pay for permits to put carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>&bull; <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_zone_%28ecology%29">Dead zones</a></b>.  Put too much nitrogen and phosophorus in the river, and lots of algae will grow in the ocean near the river&#8217;s mouth.  When the algae dies and rots, the water runs out of dissolved oxygen, and fish cannot live there.  Then we have a  &#8216;dead zone&#8217;.  Dead zones are <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/321/5891/926">expanding and increasing in number</a>.  For example, there&#8217;s one about 20,000 square kilometers in size near the mouth of the Mississippi River.  Hog farming, chicken farming and runoff from fertilized crop lands are largely to blame.</p>
<p>&bull; <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfishing">Overfishing</a>.</b>  Since there is no ownership of fish, everyone tries to catch as many fish as possible, even though this is depleting fish stocks to the point of near-extinction. There&#8217;s evidence that populations of all big predatory ocean fish have dropped 90% since 1950.  Populations of cod, bluefish tuna and many other popular fish have plummeted, despite feeble attempts at regulation.</p>
<p>&bull; <b><a href="http://www.millenniumassessment.org/en/Global.aspx">Species extinction due to habitat loss</a>.</b>  Since the economic value of intact ecosystems has not been fully reckoned, in many parts of the world there&#8217;s little price to pay for destroying them.  </p>
<p>&bull; <b><a href="http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/popnews/Newsltr_87.pdf">Overpopulation</a>.</b>   Rising population is a major cause of the stresses on our biosphere, yet it costs less to have your own child than to adopt one.  (However, a pilot project in India is offering cash payments to couples who put off having children for two years after marriage.)</p>
<p>One could go on; I haven&#8217;t even bothered to mention many well-known forms of air and water pollution.   The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_Rain_Program">Acid Rain Program</a> in the United States is an example of how people eliminated an externality: they imposed a cap-and-trade system on sulfur dioxide pollution.</p>
<p>Externalities often arise when we treat some resource as essentially infinite &mdash; for example fish, or clean water, or clean air.  We thus impose no cost for using it.  This is fine at first.  But because this resource is free, we use more and more &mdash; until it no longer makes sense to act as if we have an infinite amount.  As a physicist would say, the approximation breaks down, and we enter a new regime.  </p>
<p>This is happening all over the place now.  We have reached the point where we need to treat most resources as finite and take this into account in our economic decisions.  We can&#8217;t afford so many externalities.   It is irrational to let them go on.</p>
<p>But what can <i>you</i> do about this?  Or what can <i>I</i> do?  </p>
<p>We can do the things anyone can do.    Educate ourselves. Educate our friends.  Vote.  Conserve energy.  Don&#8217;t throw buckets of crap out of apartment windows.   </p>
<p>But what can we do that maximizes our effectiveness by taking advantage of our special skills?  </p>
<p>Starting now, a large portion of <i>This Week&#8217;s Finds</i> will be the continuing story of my attempts to answer this question.  I want to answer it for myself.  I&#8217;m not sure what <i>I</i> should do.    But since I&#8217;m a scientist, I&#8217;ll pose the question a bit more broadly, to make it a bit more interesting.  </p>
<p><i>How scientists can help save the planet</i> &mdash; that&#8217;s what I want to know.</p>

				<small>22 July, 2010</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>Terry Bollinger wrote a comment that deserves to be a post of its own, because it could start an interesting discussion.  Here it is:</p>
<hr />
<p>The theme of &#8220;what scientists can do to help save the planet&#8221; is a good one.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to introduce a topic that concerns me greatly these days: Well-intended efforts to produce <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellulosic_ethanol">cellulosic biofuels</a> that, if applied in non-tropical climates (read &#8220;not in Brazil&#8221;), could end up taking over huge percentages of land and water resources without necessarily truly solving the problem of replacing fossil fuels.</p>
<p>At present, and quite ironically, it&#8217;s not even possible to produce biofuels without using a lot of petroleum in the process. Even more ominously, there have already been cases where people who didn&#8217;t have much to begin with are going without food because <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89545855">biofuels have run up the prices</a> and taken over land that should have been used to feed them. That is a very scary trend, especially this early in the biofuels game. And if people who can at least express their need are going hungry, what does that leave as the most likely fate for forests and the animals that live in them? Again, a scary trend.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s the scientific part of my query: Are there other options that would make more sense for fueling the mobile part of our global infrastructure? Good rechargeable batteries obviously are part of the answer, but surely there are more possibilities.</p>
<p>A wild example: Is there any way a fully chemical process (versus a land-using plant base one) could use concentrated, e.g. electrical, energy from renewable sources (or perhaps nuclear, sigh) to replicate what plants do using sunlight? That is, pull CO<sub>2</sub> from the air, add water, and generate high-energy-density hydrocarbon or carbohydrate fuels?</p>
<p>The point of such a wild idea would be to achieve the goal of biofuels &mdash; less use of fossil fuels &mdash; but in a way that avoids the awful environmental consequences of, in effect, using huge areas of land or water area as a very costly and inefficient way to collect renewable solar energy [1].</p>
<p>In short: Why not separate the energy collection component from the fuel-from-CO<sub>2</sub> part, then optimize both to achieve minimal global environmental impact?</p>
<p>I know the answer: Because it&#8217;s really hard to do. But that doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean it&#8217;s impossible.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br />
Terry Bollinger</p>
<p>[1] Plants themselves are of course highly efficient at photosynthesis, especially some grasses. However, that&#8217;s the wrong metric; it&#8217;s like picking a gold nugget out of a ton of dross and then pretending the entire ton of dross has the value of gold. For biofuels, a realistic net cost metric would need to include how much land is used, the type of land used, what other uses of that land are being displaced (there is often a significant energy penalty when that is factored in correctly), and the average usable solar energy for the particular plants used. Under that kind of a full-cost metric, even the best cellulosic plant options amount to a very poor (and for some northern regions a potentially negative net benefit) way to collect solar energy.</p>

			<div class="textwidget"><p>You can <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics">include math in your comments using LaTeX</a>,  but you need to do it this way:</p>
<p>&#036;latex  E = mc^2&#036;</p>
<p>You need the word 'latex' right after the first dollar sign, and it needs a space after it.  Double dollar signs don't work, and other limitations apply, some described <a href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/latex/">here</a>.  You can't preview comments here, but I'm happy to fix errors.</p>
