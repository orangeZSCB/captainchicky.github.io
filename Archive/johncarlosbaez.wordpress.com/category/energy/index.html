<p>A bit of good news near my home.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/environment/2021/05/03/crimson-solar-project-west-blythe-receives-federal-approval/4927008001/">On Monday May 3rd</a>, the U.S Department of the Interior approved a new solar project in southern California. It&#8217;ll occupy about 2000 acres in the desert near Blythe&#8212;a town near the border with Arizona, and the Colorado River.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s called the Crimson Solar Project. It&#8217;s a 350-megawatt solar photovoltaic facility that will cost about $550 million. They say it will be able to power about 87,500 homes.</p>
<p>The choice of site for this solar project is part of California&#8217;s <a href="https://www.energy.ca.gov/programs-and-topics/programs/desert-renewable-energy-conservation-plan">Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan</a>.</p>
<p>The publication <i><a href="https://thehill.com/changing-america/sustainability/energy/551668-biden-administration-oks-massive-solar-project">The Hill</a></i> says this project will &#8220;store up to 530 megawatts of energy&#8221;&#8212;but I have no idea what that means, since megawatts isn&#8217;t a unit of energy.</p>

<p>More good news about wind power!   Earlier this month I mentioned progress on <a href="https://www.vineyardwind.com/vineyard-wind-1">Vineyard Wind</a>, a planned offshore wind farm that should generate 800 megawatts when it&#8217;s finally running.  Now the Biden adminstration has begun a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/29/fact-sheet-biden-administration-jumpstarts-offshore-wind-energy-projects-to-create-jobs/">broader initiative</a>.  They want to get sixteen construction plans for offshore wind worked out by 2025, for 19 gigawatts of wind power.   And their bigger goal is 30 gigawatts of wind power by 2030.</p>
<p>• Juliet Eilperin and Brady Dennis, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/03/29/biden-wind-power/">Biden administration launches major push to expand offshore wind power</a>, <em>Washington Post</em>, 29 March 2021.</p>
<blockquote><p>
The White House on Monday detailed an ambitious plan to expand wind farms along the East Coast and jump-start the country’s nascent offshore wind industry, saying it hoped to trigger a massive clean-energy effort in the fight against climate change.</p>
<p>The plan would generate 30 gigawatts of offshore wind power by the end of the decade — enough to power more than 10 million American homes and cut 78 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. To accomplish that, the Biden administration said, it would speed permitting for projects off the East Coast, invest in research and development, provide low-interest loans to industry and fund changes to U.S. ports.</p>
<p>“We are ready to rock-and-roll,” national climate adviser Gina McCarthy told reporters in a phone call Monday. She framed the effort as being as much about jobs as about clean energy. Offshore wind power will generate “thousands of good-paying union jobs. This is all about creating great jobs in the ocean and in our port cities and in our heartland,” she said.</p>
<p>The initiative represents a major stretch for the United States. The country has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/the-nations-first-offshore-wind-farm-is-ready-to-go-despite-critics-blow-back/2016/08/27/7a43c6d6-693f-11e6-99bf-f0cf3a6449a6_story.html">only one offshore wind project online</a> at this time, generating 30 megawatts, off Rhode Island.</p>
<div align="center"><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/the-nations-first-offshore-wind-farm-is-ready-to-go-despite-critics-blow-back/2016/08/27/7a43c6d6-693f-11e6-99bf-f0cf3a6449a6_story.html"><img width="300" src="https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_480w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/08/27/Health-Environment-Science/Graphics/2300-offshorewind0827.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>Administration officials said they would speed up offshore wind development by setting concrete deadlines for reviewing and approving permit applications; establish a new wind energy area in the waters between Long Island and the New Jersey coast; invest $230 million to upgrade U.S. ports; and provide $3 billion in potential loans for the offshore wind industry through the Energy Department.</p>
<p>The program also instructs the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to share data with Orsted, a Danish offshore wind development firm, about the U.S. waters where it holds leases. NOAA will grant $1 million to help study the impact of offshore wind operations on fishing operators as well as coastal communities.</p>
<p>The National Offshore Wind Research and Development Consortium, a joint project of the Energy Department and the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, will give $8 million in research grants to 15 offshore wind research and development projects.</p>
<p>[&#8230;.]</p>
<p>Although offshore wind represents the fastest-growing sector in renewable power, the country remains far behind Europe.</p>
<p>Europe already has 24 gigawatts of operational capacity, and Britain alone aims to have 40 gigawatts online by 2030, said Vegard Wiik Vollset, vice president of renewable energy at Rystad Energy, which analyzes the energy sector.</p>
<p>“Compared to Europe, the U.S. is very much in its infancy,” he said.</p>
<p>But wind power is poised to take off along the East Coast, with recent commitments from several states — Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Virginia — to buy at least 25,000 megawatts of offshore electricity by 2035, according to the American Clean Power Association.</p>
<p>As part of Monday’s announcement, the Interior Department’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said it will start preparing an environmental-impact statement for Ocean Wind, a New Jersey project that has 1,100 megawatts of capacity.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power_in_Massachusetts">Massachusetts law</a> requires that the state get 3,200 megawatts of offshore wind power by 2035.  This would be about 20% of the electricity they consume.  But so far they get only about 120 megawatts from wind, offshore and onshore.  Most of the potential wind energy areas shown above have not yet been developed.</p>
<p>This week there&#8217;s some promising news about <a href="https://www.vineyardwind.com/vineyard-wind-1">Vineyard Wind</a>, a planned offshore wind farm that should generate 800 megawatts when it&#8217;s finally running.  This project had been stalled for years by the federal government. But no more!   It just passed an environmental review.  The final decision about whether it can go ahead should be made in April.</p>
<p>&bull; Kelsey Tambirino, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/08/biden-administration-offshore-wind-474371">Biden administration gives major push to giant offshore wind farm</a>, <em>Politico</em>, 8 March 2021.</p>
<blockquote><p>
The Interior Department said on Monday it had <a href="https://www.boem.gov/vineyard-wind">completed its environmental review</a> for a massive wind farm off the coast of Massachusetts, a key step toward final approval of the long-stalled project that will play a prominent role in President Joe Biden&#8217;s effort to expand renewable energy in the U.S.</p>
<p>The completion of the review is a breakthrough for the U.S. offshore wind industry, which has lagged behind its European counterparts and the U.S. onshore industry <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2021/02/wind-power-sets-new-record-in-2020-despite-pandemic-2032503">that has grown rapidly</a>, even during the pandemic. It also marks a key acceleration for the Biden administration that has advocated renewables growth on public lands and waters.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a really significant step forward in the process for moving toward more offshore wind development in the United States,&#8221; Bureau of Ocean Energy Management Director Amanda Lefton told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the day the U.S. offshore wind industry has been anxiously awaiting for years. Today&#8217;s announcement provides the regulatory greenlight the industry needs to attract investments and move projects forward,&quot; said Liz Burdock, head of the non-profit group Business Network for Offshore Wind.</p>
<p>The proposed 800-megawatt project, called Vineyard Wind, would be located approximately 12 nautical miles off the coast of Martha&#8217;s Vineyard and would be the first commercial-scale offshore wind project in the country. Two other small offshore projects have been built off the coasts of Rhode Island and Virginia, but at 30 MW and 12 MW, respectively, are a fraction of the size of the Vineyard Wind project, which needs a final record of decision before construction can begin. That decision could come this spring.</p>
<p>The BOEM analysis&#8217; <a href="https://www.boem.gov/sites/default/files/documents/renewable-energy/state-activities/Vineyard-Wind-1-FEIS-Volume-1.pdf" target="_blank">preferred alternative</a> would allow up to 84 turbines to be installed in 100 of the 106 proposed blocks for the facility. It would prohibit the installation of wind turbine generators in six locations in the northernmost section of the development area and the wind turbine generators would also be required to be arranged in in a north-south and east-west orientation, with at least 1 nautical mile between each turbine.

					<p>Biden&#8217;s executive orders are now going beyond revoking those of the previous president.   He may really take climate change seriously.  It&#8217;s starting to scare some people.</p>
<p>&bull; Juliet Eilperin and Brady Dennis, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/01/27/biden-climate-change/">As Biden vows monumental action on climate change, a fight with the fossil fuel industry has only begun</a>, <i>Washington Post</i>, 27 January 2021.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Joe Biden had long promised to become the climate president, and on Wednesday he detailed far-ranging plans to shift the U.S. away from fossil fuels, create millions of jobs in renewable energy, and conserve vast swaths of public lands and water.</p>
<p>“This is not a time for small measures,” Biden said at the White House, adding that the nation had already wasted precious years as it delayed in dealing with the climate crisis.</p>
<p>But as he detailed his plans, the gas, oil and coal industries were already mobilizing on all fronts. From an oil patch in Alaska to state capitals to the halls of Congress, the industries and their allies are aiming to slow Biden’s unprecedented push for climate action and keep profits from fossil fuels flowing. Republican attorneys general from six states wrote to the new president, warning him not to overstep his authority. GOP lawmakers attacked his executive orders as “job killers.” And the petroleum industry revived television ads promoting drilling on federal lands.</p>
<p>Industry executives expressed dismay at the scope, speed and direction in which Biden is heading, saying he is going much further than President Barack Obama ever did, while environmentalists said the danger that Earth faces is far more dire now than it appeared during Obama’s tenure and requires an extraordinary response. Last year essentially tied with 2016 as the hottest year ever recorded, and scientists say the planet is speeding toward irreversible damage.</p>
<p>In barely a week in office, Biden has moved to rejoin the Paris climate accord, halt the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, impose new limits on oil and gas production, and mandate climate change as a priority across every federal agency.</p></blockquote>
<p>This article spells out the forthcoming battle in a bit more detail:</p>
<p>&bull; Coral Davenport and Lisa Friedman, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/26/climate/biden-climate-change.html">The battle lines are forming in Biden’s climate push</a>, <i>New York Times</i>, 26 January, 2020.</p>
<blockquote><p>
As President Biden prepares on Wednesday to open an ambitious effort to confront climate change, powerful and surprising forces are arrayed at his back.</p>
<p>Automakers are coming to accept that much higher fuel economy standards are their future; large oil and gas companies have said some curbs on greenhouse pollution lifted by former President Donald J. Trump should be reimposed; shareholders are demanding corporations acknowledge and prepare for a warmer, more volatile future, and a youth movement is driving the Democratic Party to go big to confront the issue.</p>
<p>But what may well stand in the president’s way is political intransigence from senators from fossil-fuel states in both parties. An evenly divided Senate has given enormous power to any single senator, and one in particular, Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, who will lead the Senate Energy Committee and who came to the Senate as a defender of his state’s coal industry.

<p><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/executive-order-on-tackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad/">Today&#8217;s executive order</a> raises the stakes:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Executive order on Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad</h3>
<p>The United States and the world face a profound climate crisis.&nbsp; We have a narrow moment to pursue action at home and abroad in order to avoid the most catastrophic impacts of that crisis and to seize the opportunity that tackling climate change&nbsp;presents.&nbsp; Domestic action must go hand in hand&nbsp;with United States international leadership, aimed at significantly enhancing global action.&nbsp; Together, we must listen&nbsp;to science and meet the moment.</p>
<p>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p>PART I &#8212; PUTTING THE CLIMATE CRISIS AT THE CENTER OF UNITED&nbsp;STATES FOREIGN POLICY AND NATIONAL SECURITY</p>
<p>Section 101.&nbsp; Policy.&nbsp; United States international engagement to address climate change &#8212; which has become a&nbsp;climate crisis &#8212; is more necessary and urgent than ever.&nbsp; The&nbsp;scientific community has made clear that the scale and speed of necessary action is greater than previously believed.&nbsp; There is little time left to avoid setting the world on a dangerous, potentially catastrophic, climate trajectory.&nbsp; Responding to the climate crisis will require both significant short-term global reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and net-zero global emissions by mid-century or before.</p>
<p>It is the policy of my Administration that climate considerations shall be an essential element of United States foreign policy and national security.&nbsp; The United States will work with other countries and partners, both bilaterally and multilaterally, to put the world on a sustainable climate pathway.&nbsp; The United States will also move quickly to build resilience, both at home and abroad, against the impacts of climate change that are already manifest and will continue to&nbsp;intensify according to current trajectories.</p>
<p>Sec. 102.&nbsp; Purpose.&nbsp; This order builds on and reaffirms actions my Administration has already taken to place the climate crisis at the forefront of this Nation&#8217;s foreign policy and national security planning, including submitting the United States instrument of acceptance to rejoin the Paris Agreement.&nbsp; In implementing &#8212; and building upon &#8212; the Paris Agreement&#8217;s three overarching objectives (a safe global temperature, increased climate resilience, and financial flows aligned with&nbsp;a&nbsp;pathway toward low greenhouse gas emissions and climate‑resilient development), the United States will exercise its leadership to promote a significant increase in global climate ambition to meet the climate challenge.&nbsp; In this regard:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp; I will host an early Leaders&#8217; Climate Summit aimed at raising climate ambition and making a positive contribution to the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) and beyond.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp; The United States will reconvene the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate, beginning with the Leaders&#8217; Climate Summit.&nbsp; In cooperation with the members of that Forum, as well&nbsp;as with other partners as appropriate, the United States will pursue green recovery efforts, initiatives to advance the&nbsp;clean energy transition, sectoral decarbonization, and alignment of financial flows with the objectives of the Paris Agreement, including with respect to coal financing, nature-based solutions, and solutions to other climate-related challenges.</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp; I have created a new Presidentially appointed position, the Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, to elevate the issue of climate change and underscore the commitment my Administration will make toward addressing it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>EMPOWERING WORKERS THROUGH REBUILDING OUR INFRASTRUCTURE FOR A&nbsp;SUSTAINABLE ECONOMY</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Sec. 212. &nbsp;Policy.&nbsp; This Nation needs millions of construction, manufacturing, engineering, and skilled-trades workers to build a new American infrastructure and clean energy economy. &nbsp;These jobs will create opportunities for young people and for older workers shifting to new professions, and for people from all backgrounds and communities. &nbsp;Such jobs will bring opportunity to communities too often left behind &#8212; places that have suffered as a result of economic shifts and places that have suffered the most from persistent pollution, including low-income rural and urban communities, communities of color, and Native communities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sec. 213. &nbsp;Sustainable Infrastructure. &nbsp;(a)&nbsp; The Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall take steps, consistent with applicable law, to ensure that Federal infrastructure investment reduces climate pollution, and to require that Federal permitting decisions consider the effects of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change.&nbsp; In addition, they shall review, and report to the National Climate Advisor on, siting and permitting processes, including those in progress under the auspices of the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council, and identify steps that can be taken, consistent with applicable law, to accelerate the deployment of clean energy and transmission projects in an environmentally stable manner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp; Agency heads conducting infrastructure reviews shall, as appropriate, consult from an early stage with State, local, and Tribal officials involved in permitting or authorizing proposed infrastructure projects to develop efficient timelines for decision-making that are appropriate given the complexities of proposed projects.</p>
<p>EMPOWERING WORKERS BY ADVANCING CONSERVATION, AGRICULTURE, AND REFORESTATION</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Sec. 214. &nbsp;Policy. &nbsp;It is the policy of my Administration to put a new generation of Americans to work conserving our public lands and waters. &nbsp;The Federal Government must protect America&#8217;s natural treasures, increase reforestation, improve access to recreation, and increase resilience to wildfires and&nbsp;storms, while creating well-paying union jobs for more Americans, including more opportunities for women and people of color in occupations where they are underrepresented.&nbsp; America&#8217;s farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners have an important role to play in combating the climate crisis and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, by sequestering carbon in soils, grasses, trees, and other vegetation and sourcing sustainable bioproducts and fuels.&nbsp; Coastal communities have an essential role to play in mitigating climate change and strengthening resilience by protecting and restoring coastal ecosystems, such as wetlands, seagrasses, coral and oyster reefs, and mangrove and kelp forests, to protect vulnerable coastlines, sequester carbon, and&nbsp;support biodiversity and fisheries.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Sec. 215. &nbsp;Civilian Climate Corps.<em>&nbsp; </em>In furtherance of the policy set forth in section 214 of this order, the Secretary of&nbsp;the Interior, in collaboration with the Secretary of Agriculture and the heads of other relevant agencies, shall submit a strategy to the Task Force within 90 days of the date of this order for creating a Civilian Climate Corps Initiative, within existing appropriations, to mobilize the next generation of conservation and resilience workers and maximize the creation of accessible training opportunities and good jobs.&nbsp; The initiative shall aim to conserve and restore public lands and waters, bolster community resilience, increase reforestation, increase carbon sequestration in the agricultural sector, protect biodiversity, improve access to recreation, and address the changing climate.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Sec. 216. &nbsp;Conserving Our Nation&#8217;s Lands and Waters.&nbsp; (a) &nbsp;The Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Commerce, the Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality, and the heads of other relevant agencies, shall submit a report to the Task Force within 90 days of the date of this order recommending steps that&nbsp;the United States should take, working with State, local, Tribal, and territorial governments, agricultural and forest landowners, fishermen, and other key stakeholders, to achieve the goal of conserving at least 30 percent of our lands and waters by 2030.</p>
<p>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp; The Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Commerce, through the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality shall, as appropriate, solicit input from State, local, Tribal, and territorial officials, agricultural and forest landowners, fishermen, and other key stakeholders in identifying strategies that will encourage broad participation in the goal of conserving 30 percent of&nbsp;our lands and waters by 2030.</p>
<p>(ii)&nbsp; The report shall propose guidelines for determining whether lands and waters qualify for conservation, and it also shall establish mechanisms to measure progress toward the 30-percent goal. &nbsp;The Secretary of the Interior shall subsequently submit annual reports to the Task Force to monitor progress.</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp; The Secretary of Agriculture shall:</p>
<p>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp; initiate efforts in the first 60 days from the date of this order to collect input from Tribes, farmers, ranchers, forest owners, conservation groups, firefighters, and other stakeholders on how to best use Department of Agriculture programs, funding and financing capacities, and other authorities, and how to encourage the voluntary adoption of climate-smart agricultural and forestry practices that decrease wildfire risk fueled by climate change and result in additional, measurable, and verifiable carbon reductions and sequestration and that source sustainable bioproducts and fuels; and</p>
<p>(ii)&nbsp; submit to the Task Force within 90 days of the date of this order a report making recommendations for an agricultural and forestry climate strategy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp; The Secretary of Commerce, through the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, shall initiate efforts in the first 60 days from the date of this order to collect input from fishermen, regional ocean councils, fishery management councils, scientists, and other stakeholders on how to make fisheries and protected resources more resilient to climate change, including changes in management and conservation measures, and improvements in science, monitoring, and cooperative research.</p>
<p>EMPOWERING WORKERS THROUGH REVITALIZING ENERGY COMMUNITIES</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Sec. 217. &nbsp;Policy. &nbsp;It is the policy of my Administration to improve air and water quality and to create well-paying union jobs and more opportunities for women and people of color in hard-hit communities, including rural communities, while reducing methane emissions, oil and brine leaks, and other environmental harms from tens of thousands of former mining and well sites. &nbsp;Mining and power plant workers drove the industrial revolution and the economic growth that followed, and have been essential to the growth of the United States.&nbsp; As the Nation shifts to a clean energy economy, Federal leadership is essential to foster economic revitalization of and investment in&nbsp;these communities, ensure the creation of good jobs that provide a choice to join a union, and secure the benefits that have been earned by workers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such work should include projects that reduce emissions of&nbsp;toxic substances and greenhouse gases from existing and abandoned infrastructure and that prevent environmental damage that harms communities and poses a risk to public health and safety.&nbsp; Plugging leaks in oil and gas wells and reclaiming abandoned mine land can create well-paying union jobs in coal, oil, and gas communities while restoring natural assets, revitalizing recreation economies, and curbing methane emissions.&nbsp; In addition, such work should include efforts to turn properties idled in these communities, such as brownfields, into new hubs for the growth of our economy.&nbsp; Federal agencies should therefore coordinate investments and other efforts to assist coal, oil and gas, and power plant communities, and achieve substantial reductions of methane emissions from the oil and gas sector as quickly as possible.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Sec. 218.&nbsp; Interagency Working Group on Coal and Power Plant Communities and Economic Revitalization<em>.&nbsp; </em>There is hereby established an Interagency Working Group on Coal and Power Plant Communities and Economic Revitalization (Interagency Working Group).&nbsp; The National Climate Advisor and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy shall serve as Co-Chairs of the Interagency Working Group.</p>

<p>(e)&nbsp; Officers.&nbsp; To facilitate the work of the Interagency Working Group, the head of each agency listed in subsection (a) of this section shall assign a designated official within the agency the authority to represent the agency on the Interagency Working Group and perform such other duties relating to the implementation of this order within the agency as the head of the agency deems appropriate.</p>
<p>SECURING ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND SPURRING ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Sec. 219. &nbsp;Policy.&nbsp; To secure an equitable economic future, the United States must ensure that environmental and economic justice are key considerations in how we govern.&nbsp; That means investing and building a clean energy economy that creates well‑paying union jobs, turning disadvantaged communities &#8212; historically marginalized and overburdened &#8212; into healthy, thriving communities, and undertaking robust actions to mitigate climate change while preparing for the impacts of climate change across rural, urban, and Tribal areas.&nbsp; Agencies shall make achieving environmental justice part of their missions by developing programs, policies, and activities to address the disproportionately high and adverse human health, environmental, climate-related and other cumulative impacts on disadvantaged communities, as well as the accompanying economic challenges of such impacts.&nbsp; It is therefore the policy of my Administration to secure environmental justice and spur economic opportunity for disadvantaged communities that have been historically marginalized and overburdened by pollution and underinvestment in housing, transportation, water and wastewater infrastructure, and health care.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Sec. 220. &nbsp;White House Environmental Justice Interagency Council.<em>&nbsp; </em>(a)&nbsp; Section 1-102 of Executive Order 12898 of February 11, 1994 (Federal Actions To Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations), is&nbsp;hereby amended to read as follows:</p>

				<small>10 December, 2020</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>A while back I mentioned the <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2020/10/21/the-sparc-fusion-reactor/">SPARC fusion reactor</a>, a relatively new design.  What about more traditional approaches to fusion?  Here&#8217;s a good article about the state of <em>funding</em> for these in the US:</p>
<p>&bull; Adrian Cho, <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/12/us-physicists-rally-around-ambitious-plan-build-fusion-power-plant">U.S. physicists rally around ambitious plan to build fusion power plant</a>, <em>Science</em>, 8 December 2020.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the start:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  U.S. fusion scientists, notorious for squabbling over which projects to fund with their field’s limited budget, have coalesced around an audacious goal. A 10-year plan presented last week to the federal Fusion Energy Sciences Advisory Committee is the first since the community tried to formulate such a road map in 2014 and failed spectacularly. It calls for the Department of Energy (DOE), the main sponsor of U.S. fusion research, to prepare to build a prototype power plant in the 2040s that would produce carbon-free electricity by harnessing the nuclear process that powers the Sun.</p>
<p>  The plan formalizes a goal <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/362/6421/1343">set out 2 years ago</a> by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine and embraced in a March report from a 15-month-long fusion community planning process. It also represents a subtle but crucial shift from the basic research that officials in DOE’s Office of Science have favored. “The community urgently wants to move forward with fusion on a time scale that can impact climate change,” says Troy Carter, a fusion physicist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who chaired the planning committee. “We have to get started.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Impact climate change&#8230; with a <em>prototype</em> in the 2040s?  Don&#8217;t hurry yourselves too much, folks!  But you might want to read this:</p>
<p>&bull; Coral Davenport, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/07/climate/ipcc-climate-report-2040.html">Major climate report describes a strong risk of crisis as early as 2040</a>,  <em>New York Times</em>, 2018 October 7.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  INCHEON, South Korea — A landmark report from the United Nations’ scientific panel on climate change paints a far more dire picture of the immediate consequences of climate change than previously thought and says that avoiding the damage requires transforming the world economy at a speed and scale that has “no documented historic precedent.”</p>
<p>  <a href="www.ipcc.ch/report/sr15/">The report</a>, issued on Monday by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of scientists convened by the United Nations to guide world leaders, describes a world of worsening food shortages and wildfires, and a mass die-off of coral reefs as soon as 2040&#8212;a period well within the lifetime of much of the global population.

				<small>12 November, 2020</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>On his first day in office, President-elect Biden plans to have the US rejoin the Paris climate accord.  He has also pledged to sign <a href="https://joebiden.com/climate-plan/#">ten executive orders</a> on his first day in office:</p>
<p>•  Requiring aggressive methane pollution limits for new and existing oil and gas operations.</p>
<p>•     Using the Federal government procurement system&#8212;which spends $500 billion every year&#8212;to drive towards 100% clean energy and zero-emissions vehicles.</p>
<p>•     Ensuring that all U.S. government installations, buildings, and facilities are more efficient and climate-ready, harnessing the purchasing power and supply chains to drive innovation.</p>
<p>•     Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transportation&#8212;the fastest growing source of U.S. climate pollution&#8212;by preserving and implementing the existing Clean Air Act, and developing rigorous new fuel economy standards aimed at ensuring 100% of new sales for light- and medium-duty vehicles will be electrified and annual improvements for heavy duty vehicles.</p>
<p>•     Doubling down on the liquid fuels of the future, which make agriculture a key part of the solution to climate change. Advanced biofuels are now closer than ever as we begin to build the first plants for biofuels, creating jobs and new solutions to reduce emissions in planes, ocean-going vessels, and more.</p>
<p>•     Saving consumers money and reduce emissions through new, aggressive appliance- and building-efficiency standards.</p>
<p>•     Committing that every federal infrastructure investment should reduce climate pollution, and require any federal permitting decision to consider the effects of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change.</p>
<p>•     Requiring public companies to disclose climate risks and the greenhouse gas emissions in their operations and supply chains.</p>
<p>•    Protecting biodiversity, slowing extinction rates and helping leverage natural climate solutions by conserving 30% of America’s lands and waters by 2030.</p>
<p>•   Protecting America’s natural treasures by permanently protecting the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and other areas impacted by President Trump’s attack on federal lands and waters, establishing national parks and monuments that reflect America’s natural heritage, banning new oil and gas permitting on public lands and waters, modifying royalties to account for climate costs, and establishing targeted programs to enhance reforestation and develop renewables on federal lands and waters with the goal of doubling offshore wind by 2030.</p>
<p>According to article in today&#8217;s <i><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2020/11/11/biden-climate-change/">Washington Post</a></i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
In a sign of how Biden has already elevated the issue, he discussed the topic with every European head of state with whom he spoke on Tuesday, including the leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Ireland. Biden has started frequently referring to the climate “crisis,” suggesting a heightened level of urgency.</p>
<p>A team of former Obama administration officials and experts have created a 300-page blueprint laying out a holistic approach to the climate while avoiding some of the pitfalls that hampered President Barack Obama, who shared some of the same goals but was unable to enact all of them. Dubbed the Climate 21 Project, it took a year and a half to develop and was delivered recently to Biden’s transition team. The document outlines how the incoming administration could restructure aspects of the government to move faster on global warming.</p></blockquote>

				<small>8 November, 2020</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>This blog does not allow discussion of partisan politics.  But I can still list some ways in which US environmental policy will change if Biden becomes president.</p>
<p>First and foremost, the US will rejoin the <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1324158992877154310">Paris Climate Agreement</a>.</p>
<p>Besides leaving the Paris Climate Agreement, the Trump administration did many other things that didn&#8217;t require approval from Congress:</p>
<p>• Nadja Popovich, Livia Albeck-Ripka and Kendra Pierre-Louis, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/climate/trump-environment-rollbacks-list.html">The Trump administration is reversing nearly 100 environmental rules. Here’s the full list,</a> <i>New York Times</i>, 15 October 2020.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the list.   Biden can reverse or halt all these actions without approval from Congress:</p>
<p><strong>Air pollution &#8211; completed:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Weakened Obama-era fuel economy and greenhouse gas standards for passenger cars and light trucks.<br />
E.P.A. and Transportation Department</li>
<li>Revoked California’s ability to set stricter tailpipe emissions standards than the federal government.<br />
E.P.A.</li>
<li>Withdrew the legal justification for an Obama-era rule that limited mercury emissions from coal power plants.<br />
E.P.A.</li>
<li>Replaced the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, which would have set strict limits on carbon emissions from coal- and gas-fired power plants, with a new version that would let states set their own rules.<br />
Executive Order; E.P.A.</li>
<li>Canceled a requirement for oil and gas companies to report methane emissions.<br />
E.P.A.</li>
<li>Revised and partially repealed an Obama-era rule limiting methane emissions on public lands, including intentional venting and flaring from drilling operations. A federal court struck down the revision in July 2020, calling the Trump administration&#8217;s reasoning “wholly inadequate” and mandating enforcement of the original rule. However, the Obama-era rule was later partially struck down in a separate court case, during which the Trump administration declined to defend it.<br />
Interior Department</li>
<li>Withdrew a Clinton-era rule designed to limit toxic emissions from major industrial polluters, and later proposed codifying the looser standards.<br />
E.P.A.</li>
<li>Revised a program designed to safeguard communities from increases in pollution from new power plants to make it easier for facilities to avoid emissions regulations.<br />
E.P.A.</li>
<li>Amended rules that govern how refineries monitor pollution in surrounding communities.<br />
E.P.A.</li>
<li>Weakened an Obama-era rule meant to reduce air pollution in national parks and wilderness areas.<br />
E.P.A.</li>
<li>Weakened oversight of some state plans for reducing air pollution in national parks.<br />
E.P.A.</li>
<li>Relaxed air pollution regulations for a handful of plants that burn waste coal for electricity.<br />
E.P.A.</li>
<li>Repealed rules meant to reduce leaking and venting of powerful greenhouse gases known as hydrofluorocarbons from large refrigeration and air conditioning systems.<br />
E.P.A.</li>
<li>Directed agencies to stop using an Obama-era calculation of the social cost of carbon, which rulemakers used to estimate the long-term economic benefits of reducing carbon dioxide emissions.<br />
Executive Order</li>
<li>Withdrew guidance directing federal agencies to include greenhouse gas emissions in environmental reviews. But several district courts have ruled that emissions must be included in such reviews.<br />
Executive Order; Council on Environmental Quality</li>
<li>Revoked an Obama executive order that set a goal of cutting the federal government’s greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent over 10 years.<br />
Executive Order</li>
<li>Repealed a requirement that state and regional authorities track tailpipe emissions from vehicles on federal highways.<br />
Transportation Department</li>
<li>Lifted a summertime ban on the use of E15, a gasoline blend made of 15 percent ethanol. (Burning gasoline with a higher concentration of ethanol in hot conditions increases smog.)<br />
E.P.A.</li>
<li>Changed rules to allow states and the E.P.A. to take longer to develop and approve plans aimed at cutting methane emissions from existing landfills.<br />
E.P.A.</li>
<li>Withdrew a proposed rule aimed at reducing pollutants, including air pollution, at sewage treatment plants.<br />
E.P.A.</li>
<li>Relaxed some Obama-era requirements for companies to monitor and repair leaks at oil and gas facilities, including exempting certain low-production wells – a significant source of methane emissions – from the requirements altogether. (Other leak regulations were eliminated.)<br />
E.P.A.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Air pollution &#8211; in progress:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Eliminated Obama-era methane emissions standards for oil and gas facilities and narrowed standards limiting the release of other polluting chemicals known as &#8220;volatile organic compounds&#8221; to only certain facilities. A federal court temporarily halted the rollback from going into effect after environmental groups and several states filed suit.<br />
E.P.A.</li>
<li>Proposed revisions to standards for carbon dioxide emissions from new, modified and reconstructed coal power plants, eliminating Obama-era restrictions that, in effect, required them to capture and store carbon dioxide emissions.<br />
E.P.A.</li>
<li>Began a review of emissions rules for power plant start-ups, shutdowns and malfunctions. One outcome of that review: In February 2020, E.P.A. reversed a requirement that Texas follow emissions rules during certain malfunction events.<br />
E.P.A.</li>
<li>Proposed a rule limiting the ability of individuals and communities to challenge E.P.A.-issued pollution permits before a panel of agency judges.<br />
E.P.A.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Drilling and extraction &#8211; completed:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Made significant cuts to the borders of two national monuments in Utah and recommended border and resource-management changes to several more.<br />
Presidential Proclamation; Interior Department</li>
<li>Lifted an Obama-era freeze on new coal leases on public lands. In April 2019, a judge ruled that the Interior Department could not begin selling new leases without completing an environmental review. In February 2020, the agency published an assessment that concluded restarting federal coal leasing would have little environmental impact.<br />
Executive Order; Interior Department</li>
<li>Finalized a plan to open up part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska for oil and gas development, a move that overturns six decades of protections for the largest remaining stretch of wilderness in the United States.<br />
Congress; Interior Department</li>
<li>Approved construction of the Dakota Access pipeline, less than a mile from the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. (The Obama administration had halted the project, with the Army Corps of Engineers saying it would explore alternative routes.) The pipeline is embroiled in a lengthy legal battle, but has been allowed to continue operating by the Army Corps of Engineers even though a federal court reversed the Corps&#8217; decision to allow the pipeline to run along its current path.<br />
Executive Order; Army</li>
<li>Rescinded water pollution regulations for fracking on federal and Indian lands.<br />
Interior Department</li>
<li>Scrapped a proposed rule that required mines to prove they could pay to clean up future pollution.<br />
E.P.A.</li>
<li>Withdrew a requirement that Gulf oil rig owners prove they can cover the costs of removing rigs once they stop producing.<br />
Interior Department</li>
<li>Moved the permitting process for certain projects that cross international borders, such as oil pipelines, to the office of the president from the State Department, exempting them from environmental review.<br />
Executive Order</li>
<li>Changed how the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission considers the indirect effects of greenhouse gas emissions in environmental reviews of pipelines.<br />
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</li>
<li>Revoked an Obama-era executive order designed to preserve ocean, coastal and Great Lakes waters in favor of a policy focused on energy production and economic growth.<br />
Executive Order</li>
<li>Loosened offshore drilling safety regulations implemented by the Obama after following the 2010 Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill, including reduced testing requirements for blowout prevention systems.<br />
Interior Department</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Drilling and extraction &#8211; in progress</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Proposed opening most of America’s coastal waters to offshore oil and gas drilling, but delayed the plan after a federal judge in 2019 ruled that reversing a ban on drilling in the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans was unlawful. Ahead of the 2020 election, Mr. Trump announced he would exempt from drilling coastal areas around Florida, a crucial battleground state, Georgia and South Carolina.<br />
Interior Department</li>
<li>Repealed an Obama-era rule governing royalties for oil, gas and coal leases on federal lands, which replaced a 1980s rule that critics said allowed companies to underpay the federal government. A federal judge struck down the Trump administration’s repeal, but another court froze the original rule pending litigation.<br />
Interior Department</li>
<li>Proposed easing the approval process for oil and gas drilling in national forests by curbing the power of the Forest Service to review and approve leases, among other changes.<br />
Agriculture Department; Interior Department</li>
<li>Withdrew proposed restrictions on mining in Bristol Bay, Alaska, despite concerns over environmental impacts on salmon habitat, including a prominent fishery. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has so far denied a permit for a proposed project, known as the Pebble Mine, noting it “could have substantial environmental impacts,” but left the door open for a revised plan.<br />
E.P.A.; Army</li>
<li>Proposed revising regulations on offshore oil and gas exploration by floating vessels in the Arctic that were developed after a 2013 accident. The Interior Department previously said it was “considering full rescission or revision of this rule.”<br />
Executive Order; Interior Department</li>
<li>Proposed opening more land for drilling in the Alaska National Petroleum Reserve, a vast swath of public land on the Arctic Ocean. The Obama administration had designated about half of the reserve as a conservation area.<br />
Interior Department</li>
<li>Finalized a plan to allow logging and road construction in Tongass National Forest, Alaska, by exempting the area from a Clinton-era policy known as the roadless rule, which applied to much of the national forest system.<br />
Interior Department</li>
<li>Approved the Keystone XL pipeline rejected by President Barack Obama, but a federal judge blocked the project from going forward without an adequate environmental review process. The Supreme Court in July 2020 upheld that ruling, further delaying construction of the pipeline.<br />
Executive Order; State Department</li>
<li>Approved the use of seismic air guns for gas and oil exploration in the Atlantic Ocean. The Obama administration had denied permits for such surveys, which can kill marine life and disrupt fisheries. However, the Trump administration&#8217;s permits to allow seismic surveys expired following a protracted lawsuit, ending the possibility of seismic air gun surveys in the Atlantic in the near term. Companies would need to restart the months-long permitting process.<br />
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Infrastructure &#8211; completed:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Weakened the National Environmental Policy Act, one of the country&#8217;s most significant environmental laws, in order to expedite the approval of public infrastructure projects, such as roads, pipelines and telecommunications networks. The new rules shorten the time frame for completing environmental studies, limit the types of projects subject to review, and no longer require federal agencies to account for a project&#8217;s cumulative effects on the environment, such as climate change.<br />
Council on Environmental Quality</li>
<li>Revoked Obama-era flood standards for federal infrastructure projects that required the government to account for sea level rise and other climate change effects.<br />
Executive Order</li>
<li>Relaxed the environmental review process for federal infrastructure projects.<br />
Executive Order</li>
<li>Overturned an Obama-era guidance that ended U.S. government financing for new coal plants overseas except in rare circumstances.<br />
Executive Order; Treasury Department</li>
<li>Revoked a directive for federal agencies to minimize impacts on water, wildlife, land and other natural resources when approving development projects.<br />
Executive Order</li>
<li>Revoked an Obama executive order promoting climate resilience in the northern Bering Sea region of Alaska, which withdrew local waters from oil and gas leasing and established a tribal advisory council to consult on local environmental issues.<br />
Executive Order</li>
<li>Reversed an update to the Bureau of Land Management’s public land-use planning process.<br />
Congress</li>
<li>Withdrew an Obama-era order to consider climate change in the management of natural resources in national parks.<br />
National Park Service</li>
<li>Restricted most Interior Department environmental studies to one year in length and a maximum of 150 pages, citing a need to reduce paperwork.<br />
Interior Department</li>
<li>Withdrew a number of Obama-era Interior Department climate change and conservation policies that the agency said could “burden the development or utilization of domestically produced energy resources.”<br />
Interior Department</li>
<li>Eliminated the use of an Obama-era planning system designed to minimize harm from oil and gas activity on sensitive landscapes, such as national parks.<br />
Interior Department</li>
<li>Withdrew Obama-era policies designed to maintain or, ideally, improve natural resources affected by federal projects.<br />
Interior Department</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Infrastructure &#8211; in progress:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Proposed plans to speed up the environmental review process for Forest Service projects.<br />
Agriculture Department</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Animals &#8211; completed:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Changed the way the Endangered Species Act is applied, making it more difficult to protect wildlife from long-term threats posed by climate change.<br />
Interior Department; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</li>
<li>Ended the automatic application of full protections for &#8216;threatened&#8217; plants and animals, the classification one step below &#8216;endangered&#8217; in the Endangered Species Act.<br />
Interior Department</li>
<li>Relaxed environmental protections for salmon and smelt in California’s Central Valley in order to free up water for farmers.<br />
Executive Order; Interior Department</li>
<li>Overturned a ban on the use of lead ammunition and fishing tackle on federal lands.<br />
Interior Department</li>
<li>Overturned a ban on the hunting of predators in Alaskan wildlife refuges.<br />
Congress</li>
<li>Reversed an Obama-era rule that barred using bait, such as grease-soaked doughnuts, to lure and kill grizzly bears, among other sport hunting practices that many people consider extreme, on some public lands in Alaska.<br />
National Park Service; Interior Department</li>
<li>Amended fishing regulations to loosen restrictions on the harvest of a number of species.<br />
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</li>
<li>Removed restrictions on commercial fishing in a protected marine preserve southeast of Cape Cod that is home to rare corals and a number of endangered sea animals. The Trump administration has suggested changing the management or size of two other marine protected areas in the Pacific Ocean.<br />
Executive Order; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</li>
<li>Proposed revising limits on the number of endangered marine mammals and sea turtles that can be unintentionally killed or injured with sword-fishing nets on the West Coast. (The Obama-era rules were initially withdrawn by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, but were later finalized following a court order. The agency has said it plans to revise the limits.)<br />
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</li>
<li>Loosened fishing restrictions intended to reduce bycatch of Atlantic Bluefin Tuna. Nonprofits have filed a lawsuit challenging the rollback.<br />
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</li>
<li>Overturned a ban on using parts of migratory birds in handicrafts made by Alaskan Natives.<br />
Interior Department</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Animals &#8211; in progress:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Proposed weakening critical habitat protections under the Endangered Species Act by making it easier to exclude certain areas, including for public-works projects, such as schools and hospitals, and for public lands leased to non-government businesses.<br />
Interior Department</li>
<li>Opened nine million acres of Western land to oil and gas drilling by weakening habitat protections for the sage grouse, an imperiled bird. The Idaho District Court temporarily blocked the measure. The Montana District Court also invalidated the directive, nullifying 440 oil and gas leases, but the ruling is on hold pending appeal.<br />
Interior Department</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Water pollution &#8211; completed:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Scaled back pollution protections for certain tributaries and wetlands that were regulated under the Clean Water Act by the Obama administration. (A federal judge in Colorado halted implementation of the rule within the state, but it is in effect elsewhere.)<br />
E.P.A.; Army</li>
<li>Revoked a rule that prevented coal companies from dumping mining debris into local streams.<br />
Congress</li>
<li>Weakened a rule that aimed to limit toxic discharge from power plants into public waterways.<br />
E.P.A.</li>
<li>Weakened a portion of the Clean Water Act to make it easier for federal agencies to issue permits for federal projects over state objections if the projects don&#8217;t meet local water quality standards, including for pipelines and other fossil fuel facilities.<br />
Executive Order; E.P.A. holding areas, which can spill their contents because they lack a protective underlay.<br />
E.P.A.</li>
<li>Withdrew a proposed rule requiring groundwater protections for certain uranium mines. Recently, the administration’s Nuclear Fuel Working Group proposed opening up 1,500 acres outside the Grand Canyon to nuclear production.<br />
E.P.A.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Water pollution &#8211; in progress:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Proposed doubling the time allowed for utilities to remove lead pipes from water systems with high levels of lead.<br />
E.P.A.</li>
<li>Attempted to weaken federal rules regulating the disposal and storage of coal ash waste from power plants, but a court determined the original rules were already insufficient to protect the environment. The E.P.A. then proposed a new rule that would allow unlined coal ash ponds, previously deemed unsafe, to continue operating.<br />
E.P.A.</li>
<li>Proposed a regulation limiting the scope of an Obama-era rule under which companies had to prove that large deposits of recycled coal ash would not harm the environment.<br />
E.P.A.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Toxic substances and safety &#8211; completed:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Rejected a proposed ban on chlorpyrifos, a pesticide linked to developmental disabilities in children. In 2020, the E.P.A. also rejected its own earlier finding that the pesticide can cause serious health problems. (Several states have banned use of the pesticide and its main manufacturer said it would stop producing the product because of shrinking demand.)<br />
E.P.A.</li>
<li>Narrowed the scope of a 2016 law mandating safety assessments for potentially toxic chemicals like dry-cleaning solvents. The updated rules allowed the E.P.A. to exclude some chemical uses and types of exposure in the review process. In November 2019, a court of appeals ruled the agency must widen its scope to consider full exposure risks, but watchdog groups say the agency has not done so in some assessments.<br />
E.P.A.</li>
<li>Reversed an Obama-era rule that required braking system upgrades for “high hazard” trains hauling flammable liquids like oil and ethanol.<br />
Transportation Department</li>
<li>Changed safety rules to allow for rail transport of highly flammable liquefied natural gas.<br />
Transportation Department</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Toxic substances and safety &#8211; in progress:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Proposed limiting pesticide application buffer zones that are intended to protect farmworkers and bystanders from accidental exposure.<br />
E.P.A.</li>
<li>Announced a review of an Obama-era rule lowering coal dust limits in mines. The head of the Mine Safety and Health Administration said there were no immediate plans to change the dust limit but has extended a public comment period until 2022.<br />
Labor Department</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Other &#8211; completed:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Repealed an Obama-era regulation that would have nearly doubled the number of light bulbs subject to energy-efficiency standards starting in January 2020. The Energy Department also blocked the next phase of efficiency standards for general-purpose bulbs already subject to regulation.<br />
Energy Department</li>
<li>Changed a 25-year-old policy to allow coastal replenishment projects to use sand from protected ecosystems.<br />
Interior Department</li>
<li>Limited funding of environmental and community development projects through corporate settlements of federal lawsuits.<br />
Justice Department</li>
<li>Stopped payments to the Green Climate Fund, a United Nations program to help poorer countries reduce carbon emissions.<br />
Executive Order</li>
<li>Reversed restrictions on the sale of plastic water bottles in national parks desgined to cut down on litter, despite a Park Service report that the effort worked.<br />
Interior Department</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Other &#8211; in progress:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Proposed limiting the studies used by the E.P.A. for rulemaking to only those that make data publicly available. (Scientists widely criticized the proposal, saying it would effectively block the agency from considering landmark research that relies on confidential health data.)<br />
E.P.A.</li>
<li>Proposed changes to the way cost-benefit analyses are conducted under the Clean Air Act. Similar rules for the Clean Water Act and other environmental statutes are in development.<br />
E.P.A.</li>
<li>Proposed freezing efficiency standards for residential furnaces and commercial water heaters designed to reduce energy use.<br />
Energy Department</li>
<li>Created a product category that would allow some dishwashers to be exempt from energy efficiency standards.<br />
Energy Department</li>
<li>Initially withdrew, and then delayed, a proposed rule that would inform car owners about fuel-efficient replacement tires.<br />
Transportation Department</li>
</ol>

<p>There&#8217;s a lot of excitement about a new approach to fusion power:</p>
<p>• Henry Fountain, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/climate/nuclear-fusion-reactor.html">Compact nuclear fusion reactor is ‘very likely to work,’ studies suggest</a>, <i>The New York Times</i>, 29 September 2020.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Scientists developing a compact version of a nuclear fusion reactor have shown in a series of research papers that it should work, renewing hopes that the long-elusive goal of mimicking the way the sun produces energy might be achieved and eventually contribute to the fight against climate change.</p>
<p>Construction of a reactor, called SPARC, which is being developed by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a spinoff company, Commonwealth Fusion Systems, is expected to begin next spring and take three or four years, the researchers and company officials said.</p>
<p>Although many significant challenges remain, the company said construction would be followed by testing and, if successful, building of a power plant that could use fusion energy to generate electricity, beginning in the next decade.</p>
<p>This ambitious timetable is far faster than that of the world’s largest fusion-power project, a multinational effort in Southern France called ITER, for International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor. That reactor has been under construction since 2013 and, although it is not designed to generate electricity, is expected to produce a fusion reaction by 2035.</p></blockquote>
<p>But fusion has been twenty years off since the 1950s.   What&#8217;s the evidence that Sparc will work?  I guess most of the evidence is here&#8212;a series of seven papers, which luckily are available open-access:</p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-plasma-physics/collections/status-of-the-sparc-physics-basis">Status of the SPARC physics basics</a>, <i>Journal of Plasma Physics</i> <b>86</b> (2020).</p>
<p>I have not read these!   And even if I did, since I&#8217;m not an expert on fusion reactors&#8212;obviously a tricky subject&#8212;I&#8217;m not sure how much my impression would help.</p>
<p>Do you know any commentary on SPARC from other experts on fusion reactors?  The more detailed, the better.  All I&#8217;ve seen so far are very sketchy remarks from people who don&#8217;t seem to know what they&#8217;re talking about.</p>

<p>Yet another interesting book I haven&#8217;t read yet:</p>
<p>• Vaclav Smil, <i>Growth: From Microorganisms to Megacities</i>, MIT Press, Cambridge, 2019.</p>
<p>As I hope you know, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaclav_Smil">Vaclav Smil</a> is an expert on energy, food, population, and economics, who assembles and analyzes data in fact-filled books like <i>Energy and Civilization: a History</i>.  Bill Gates has said &#8220;I wait for new Smil books the way some people wait for the next &#8216;Star Wars&#8217; movie.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was interviewed here:</p>
<p>• Jonathan Watts, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/21/vaclav-smil-interview-growth-must-end-economists">Vaclav Smil: ‘Growth must end. Our economist friends don’t seem to realise that’</a>, 21 September 2019.</p>
<p>The interview begins:</p>
<blockquote><p>You are the nerd’s nerd. There is perhaps no other academic who paints pictures with numbers like you. You dug up the astonishing statistic that China has poured more cement every three years since 2003 than the US managed in the entire 20th century. You calculated that in 2000, the dry mass of all the humans in the world was 125m metric tonnes compared with just 10m tonnes for all wild vertebrates. And now you explore patterns of growth, from the healthy development of forests and brains to the unhealthy increase in obesity and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Before we get into those deeper issues, can I ask if you see yourself as a nerd?</p></blockquote>
<p>The facts here are fascinating but the question is absurd. Are we really sinking into such anti-intellectualism that a journalist feels the need to start a conversation with a scientist by asking if he sees himself as a &#8220;nerd&#8221;?</p>
<p>I&#8217;d have been tempted to reply &#8220;First, can I ask if you see yourself as a twit?&#8221; Smil more wisely replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>Not at all. I’m just an old-fashioned scientist describing the world and the lay of the land as it is. That’s all there is to it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s why he wrote the book:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have deliberately set out to write the megabook on growth. In a way, it’s unwieldy and unreasonable. People can take any number of books out of it&#8211;economists can read about the growth of GDP and population; biologists can read about the growth of organisms and human bodies. But I wanted to put it all together under one roof so people could see how these things are inevitably connected and how it all shares one crystal clarity: that growth must come to an end. Our economist friends don’t seem to realise that.</p></blockquote>
<p>He advocates <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrowth">degrowth</a> in some places&#8230; but growth in others:</p>
<blockquote><p>[&#8230;] it’s important not to talk in global terms. There will be many approaches which have to be tailored and targeted to each different audience. There is this pernicious idea by this [Thomas] Friedman guy that the world is flat and everything is now the same, so what works in one place can work for everyone. But that’s totally wrong. For example, Denmark has nothing in common with Nigeria. What you do in each place will be different. What we need in Nigeria is more food, more growth. In Philippines we need a little more of it. And in Canada and Sweden, we need less of it. We have to look at it from different points of view. In some places we have to foster what economists call de-growth. In other places, we have to foster growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m sure his book will be more interesting than these quotes, because it&#8217;ll be full of well-organized and important facts&#8212;and the questions surrounding growth are some of the most pressing of our age.</p>

				<small>26 June, 2019</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>Here&#8217;s a cool paper which seems to be freely available:</p>
<p>&bull;  Nancy M. Haegel <i>et al.</i>, <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6443/836">Terawatt-scale photovoltaics: transform global energy</a>, <i>Science</i> <b>364</b> (2019), 836&#8211;838.</p>
<p>Important topic!  Here&#8217;s the abstract:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Solar energy has the potential to play a central role in the future global energy system because of the scale of the solar resource, its predictability, and its ubiquitous nature. Global installed solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity exceeded 500 GW at the end of 2018, and an estimated additional 500 GW of PV capacity is projected to be installed by 2022–2023, bringing us into the era of TW-scale PV. Given the speed of change in the PV industry, both in terms of continued dramatic cost decreases and manufacturing-scale increases, the growth toward TW-scale PV has caught many observers, including many of us (1), by surprise. Two years ago, we focused on the challenges of achieving 3 to 10 TW of PV by 2030. Here, we envision a future with ∼10 TW of PV by 2030 and 30 to 70 TW by 2050, providing a majority of global energy. PV would be not just a key contributor to electricity generation but also a central contributor to all segments of the global energy system. We discuss ramifications and challenges for complementary technologies (e.g., energy storage, power to gas/liquid fuels/chemicals, grid integration, and multiple sector electrification) and summarize what is needed in research in PV performance, reliability, manufacturing, and recycling.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, increased energy storage is needed to take advantage of solar power.  Let&#8217;s see what they say about that:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <strong>Energy storage</strong></p>
<p>  At high penetration, increased PV installation is synergistic with increased storage. Tesla recently installed a 100-MW battery in South Australia and in the first 6 months recovered 14% of the capital cost. California is also setting aggressive targets for storage. The price of lithium-ion batteries has decreased by more than 80% in the past 8 years, and improvements are expected to continue through a combination of technological advances and increased manufacturing capacity. To achieve the U.S. Department of Energy target price of U.S. $150/kWh for automotive batteries capable of charging within 15 minutes, research should explore materials with higher energy density to further reduce costs, focusing on nickel-rich, critical-materials–free cathodes and advanced anodes for lithium-ion systems. With further research and cost reduction, flow batteries and sodium-ion and multivalent-ion or conversion systems could also hold the promise of long-term competitors to lithium ion.</p>
<p>  An additional approach to battery-based storage is pumped-storage hydropower (pumped hydro). Recent research indicates that there is a substantial technical potential for untapped off-river (closed-loop) pumped hydro and other forms of gravity storage in many parts of the world (9, 10). Pumped hydro has the advantage of being able to provide short-term responsiveness and diurnal-scale storage potentially at low cost.</p>
<p>  The biggest challenge may be to meet energy requirements during the winter at high latitudes. However, wind power tends to be more abundant in many of these locations, whereas most of the world&#8217;s population lives closer to the equator. Economic development as well as population growth may be dominated by countries within 35° of the equator in the coming decades.
</p></blockquote>
