<p>• John Baez, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05610">The fundamental theorem of natural selection</a>.</p>
<p>Check it out! If you have any questions or see any mistakes, please let me know.</p>
<p>Just for fun, here&#8217;s the abstract and introduction.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract.</strong> Suppose we have <i>n</i> different types of self-replicating entity, with the population <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="P_i" class="latex" /> of the <i>i</i>th type changing at a rate equal to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="P_i" class="latex" /> times the fitness <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_i" class="latex" /> of that type. Suppose the fitness <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_i" class="latex" /> is any continuous function of all the populations <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+P_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="P_1, &#92;dots, P_n" class="latex" />. Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p_i" class="latex" /> be the fraction of replicators that are of the <i>i</i>th type. Then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p+%3D+%28p_1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+p_n%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p = (p_1, &#92;dots, p_n)" class="latex" /> is a time-dependent probability distribution, and we prove that its speed as measured by the Fisher information metric equals the variance in fitness. In rough terms, this says that the speed at which information is updated through natural selection equals the variance in fitness. This result can be seen as a modified version of Fisher&#8217;s fundamental theorem of natural selection. We compare it to Fisher&#8217;s original result as interpreted by Price, Ewens and Edwards.</p>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>In 1930, Fisher stated his &#8220;fundamental theorem of natural selection&#8221; as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>The rate of increase in fitness of any organism at any time is equal to its genetic variance in fitness at that time</p></blockquote>
<p>Some tried to make this statement precise as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>The time derivative of the mean fitness of a population equals the variance of its fitness.</p></blockquote>
<p>But this is only true under very restrictive conditions, so a controversy was ignited.</p>
<p>An interesting resolution was proposed by Price, and later amplified by Ewens and Edwards. We can formalize their idea as follows. Suppose we have <i>n</i> types of self-replicating entity, and idealize the population of the <i>i</i>th type as a real-valued function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_i%28t%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="P_i(t)" class="latex" />. Suppose</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7Bd%7D%7Bdt%7D+P_i%28t%29+%3D+f_i%28P_1%28t%29%2C+%5Cdots%2C+P_n%28t%29%29+%5C%2C+P_i%28t%29+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{d}{dt} P_i(t) = f_i(P_1(t), &#92;dots, P_n(t)) &#92;, P_i(t) } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>where the fitness <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_i" class="latex" /> is a differentiable function of the populations of every type of replicator. The mean fitness at time <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="t" class="latex" /> is</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Coverline%7Bf%7D%28t%29+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5En+p_i%28t%29+%5C%2C+f_i%28P_1%28t%29%2C+%5Cdots%2C+P_n%28t%29%29+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;overline{f}(t) = &#92;sum_{i=1}^n p_i(t) &#92;, f_i(P_1(t), &#92;dots, P_n(t)) } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_i%28t%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p_i(t)" class="latex" /> is the fraction of replicators of the <i>i</i>th type:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+p_i%28t%29+%3D+%5Cfrac%7BP_i%28t%29%7D%7B%5Cphantom%7B%5CBig%7C%7D+%5Csum_%7Bj+%3D+1%7D%5En+P_j%28t%29+%7D+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ p_i(t) = &#92;frac{P_i(t)}{&#92;phantom{&#92;Big|} &#92;sum_{j = 1}^n P_j(t) } } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>By the product rule, the rate of change of the mean fitness is the sum of two terms:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7Bd%7D%7Bdt%7D+%5Coverline%7Bf%7D%28t%29+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5En+%5Cdot%7Bp%7D_i%28t%29+%5C%2C+f_i%28P_1%28t%29%2C+%5Cdots%2C+P_n%28t%29%29+%5C%3B+%2B+%5C%3B+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{d}{dt} &#92;overline{f}(t) = &#92;sum_{i=1}^n &#92;dot{p}_i(t) &#92;, f_i(P_1(t), &#92;dots, P_n(t)) &#92;; + &#92;; }" class="latex" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5En+p_i%28t%29+%5C%2C%5Cfrac%7Bd%7D%7Bdt%7D+f_i%28P_1%28t%29%2C+%5Cdots%2C+P_n%28t%29%29+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;sum_{i=1}^n p_i(t) &#92;,&#92;frac{d}{dt} f_i(P_1(t), &#92;dots, P_n(t)) } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>The <i>first</i> of these two terms equals the variance of the fitness at time <i>t</i>. We give the easy proof in Theorem 1. Unfortunately, the conceptual significance of this first term is much less clear than that of the total rate of change of mean fitness. Ewens concluded that &#8220;the theorem does not provide the substantial biological statement that Fisher claimed&#8221;.</p>
<p>But there is another way out, based on an idea Fisher himself introduced in 1922: Fisher information. Fisher information gives rise to a Riemannian metric on the space of probability distributions on a finite set, called the &#8216;Fisher information metric&#8217;&#8212;or in the context of evolutionary game theory, the &#8216;Shahshahani metric&#8217;. Using this metric we can define the speed at which a time-dependent probability distribution changes with time. We call this its &#8216;Fisher speed&#8217;. Under just the assumptions already stated, we prove in Theorem 2 that the Fisher speed of the probability distribution</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%28t%29+%3D+%28p_1%28t%29%2C+%5Cdots%2C+p_n%28t%29%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p(t) = (p_1(t), &#92;dots, p_n(t)) " class="latex" /></p>
<p>is the variance of the fitness at time <i>t</i>.</p>
<p>As explained by Harper, natural selection can be thought of as a learning process, and studied using ideas from information geometry&#8212;that is, the geometry of the space of probability distributions. As <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%28t%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p(t)" class="latex" /> changes with time, the rate at which information is updated is closely connected to its Fisher speed. Thus, our revised version of the fundamental theorem of natural selection can be loosely stated as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>As a population changes with time, the rate at which information is updated equals the variance of fitness.</p></blockquote>
<p>The precise statement, with all the hypotheses, is in Theorem 2. But one lesson is this: variance in fitness may not cause &#8216;progress&#8217; in the sense of increased mean fitness, but it does cause change!</p>

<p><a>Larry Li</a>, <a href="https://biology.pnnl.gov/people/bill-cannon">Bill Cannon</a> and I ran a session on non-equilibrium thermodynamics in biology at <a href="https://www.smb2021.org/home">SMB2021</a>, the annual meeting of the Society for Mathematical Biology.  You can see talk slides here!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the basic idea:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Since Lotka, physical scientists have argued that living things belong to a class of complex and orderly systems that exist not despite the second law of thermodynamics, but because of it. Life and evolution, through natural selection of dissipative structures, are based on non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The challenge is to develop an understanding of what the respective physical laws can tell us about flows of energy and matter in living systems, and about growth, death and selection. This session addresses current challenges including understanding emergence, regulation and control across scales, and entropy production, from metabolism in microbes to evolving ecosystems.</p></blockquote>

Maximum Caliber is a principle for inferring pathways and rate distributions of kinetic processes.

Pierre Gaspard, Université libre de Bruxelles</p>
<blockquote><p>
Nearly 70 years have passed since the discovery of DNA structure and its role in coding genetic information. Yet, the kinetics and thermodynamics of genetic information processing in DNA replication, transcription, and translation remain poorly understood. These template-directed copolymerization processes are running away from equilibrium, being powered by extracellular energy sources. Recent advances show that their kinetic equations can be exactly solved in terms of so-called iterated function systems. Remarkably, iterated function systems can determine the effects of genome sequence on replication errors, up to a million times faster than kinetic Monte Carlo algorithms. With these new methods, fundamental links can be established between molecular information processing and the second law of thermodynamics, shedding a new light on genetic drift, mutations, and evolution.</p></blockquote>

John Harte, University of California, Berkeley</p>
<blockquote><p>
The Maximum Entropy Theory of Ecology (METE) predicts the shapes of macroecological metrics in relatively static ecosystems, across spatial scales, taxonomic categories, and habitats, using constraints imposed by static state variables. In disturbed ecosystems, however, with time-varying state variables, its predictions often fail. We extend macroecological theory from static to dynamic, by combining the MaxEnt inference procedure with explicit mechanisms governing disturbance. In the static limit, the resulting theory, DynaMETE, reduces to METE but also predicts a new scaling relationship among static state variables. Under disturbances, expressed as shifts in demographic, ontogenic growth, or migration rates, DynaMETE predicts the time trajectories of the state variables as well as the time-varying shapes of macroecological metrics such as the species abundance distribution and the distribution of metabolic rates over<br />
individuals. An iterative procedure for solving the dynamic theory is presented. Characteristic signatures of the deviation from static predictions of macroecological patterns are shown to result from different kinds of disturbance. By combining MaxEnt inference with explicit dynamical mechanisms of disturbance, DynaMETE is a candidate theory of macroecology for ecosystems responding to anthropogenic or natural disturbances.</p></blockquote>

Supriya Krishnamurthy, Stockholm University</p>
<blockquote><p>
The study of chemical reaction networks (CRN&#8217;s) is a very active field. Earlier well-known results (Feinberg Chem. Enc. Sci. 42 2229 (1987), Anderson et al Bull. Math. Biol. 72 1947 (2010)) identify a topological quantity called deficiency, easy to compute for CRNs of any size, which, when exactly equal to zero, leads to a unique factorized (non-equilibrium) steady-state for these networks. No general results exist however for the steady states of non-zero-deficiency networks. In recent work, we show how to write the full moment-hierarchy for any non-zero-deficiency CRN obeying mass-action kinetics, in terms of equations for the factorial moments. Using these, we can recursively predict values for lower moments from higher moments, reversing the procedure usually used to solve moment hierarchies. We show, for non-trivial examples, that in this manner we can predict any moment of interest, for CRN&#8217;s with non-zero deficiency and non-factorizable steady states. It is however an open question how scalable these techniques are for large networks.</p></blockquote>

Christof Mast, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München</p>
<blockquote><p>
Prebiotic reactions often require certain initial concentrations of ions. For example, the activity of RNA enzymes requires a lot of divalent magnesium salt, whereas too much monovalent sodium salt leads to a reduction in enzyme function. However, it is known from leaching experiments that prebiotically relevant geomaterial such as basalt releases mainly a lot of sodium and only little magnesium. A natural solution to this problem is heat fluxes through thin rock fractures, through which magnesium is actively enriched and sodium is depleted by thermogravitational convection and thermophoresis. This process establishes suitable conditions for ribozyme function from a basaltic leach. It can take place in a spatially distributed system of rock cracks and is therefore particularly stable to natural fluctuations and disturbances.</p></blockquote>
<p>• <b>Deficiency of chemical reaction networks and thermodynamics</b><br />
Matteo Polettini, University of Luxembourg</p>
<blockquote><p>
Deficiency is a topological property of a Chemical Reaction Network linked to important dynamical features, in particular of deterministic fixed points and of stochastic stationary states. Here we link it to thermodynamics: in particular we discuss the validity of a strong vs. weak zeroth law, the existence of time-reversed mass-action kinetics, and the possibility to formulate marginal fluctuation relations.

Hong Qian, University of Washington</p>
<blockquote><p>
The mathematical theory of large deviations provides a nonequilibrium thermodynamic description of complex biological systems that consist of heterogeneous individuals. In terms of the notions of stochastic elementary reactions and pure kinetic species, the continuous-time, integer-valued Markov process dictates a thermodynamic structure that generalizes (i) Gibbs&#8217; microscopic chemical thermodynamics of equilibrium matters to nonequilibrium small systems such as living cells and tissues; and (ii) Gibbs&#8217; potential function to the landscapes for biological dynamics, such as that of C. H. Waddington and S. Wright.</p></blockquote>

Joseph Vallino, Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole</p>
<blockquote><p>
Natural microbial communities contain billions of individuals per liter and can exceed a trillion cells per liter in sediments, as well as harbor thousands of species in the same volume. The high species diversity contributes to extensive metabolic functional capabilities to extract chemical energy from the environment, such as methanogenesis, sulfate reduction, anaerobic photosynthesis, chemoautotrophy, and many others, most of which are only expressed by bacteria and archaea. Reductionist modeling of natural communities is problematic, as we lack knowledge on growth kinetics for most organisms and have even less understanding on the mechanisms governing predation, viral lysis, and predator avoidance in these systems. As a result, existing models that describe microbial communities contain dozens to hundreds of parameters, and state variables are extensively aggregated. Overall, the models are little more than non-linear parameter fitting exercises that have limited, to no, extrapolation potential, as there are few principles governing organization and function of complex self-assembling systems. Over the last decade, we have been developing a systems approach that models microbial communities as a distributed metabolic network that focuses on metabolic function rather than describing individuals or species. We use an optimization approach to determine which metabolic functions in the network should be up regulated versus those that should be down regulated based on the non-equilibrium thermodynamics principle of maximum entropy production (MEP). Derived from statistical mechanics, MEP proposes that steady state systems will likely organize to maximize free energy dissipation rate. We have extended this conjecture to apply to non-steady state systems and have proposed that living systems maximize entropy production integrated over time and space, while non-living systems maximize instantaneous entropy production. Our presentation will provide a brief overview of the theory and approach, as well as present several examples of applying MEP to describe the biogeochemistry of microbial systems in laboratory experiments and natural ecosystems.</p></blockquote>

<p>Together with <a href="">William Cannon</a> and <a href="https://iigb.ucr.edu/blli/">Larry Li</a>, I&#8217;m helping run a minisymposium as part of <a href="https://www.smb2021.org/home">SMB2021</a>, the annual meeting of the Society for Mathematical Biology:</p>
<p>• Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics in Biology: from Chemical Reaction Networks to Natural Selection, Monday June 14, 2021, beginning 9:30 am Pacific Time.</p>
<p>You can register for free <a href="https://www.smb2021.org/registration">here</a> before May 31st, 11:59 pm Pacific Time.  You need to register to watch the talks live on Zoom.  I think the talks will be recorded.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the idea:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <strong>Abstract:</strong> Since Lotka, ﻿physical scientists have argued that living things belong to a class of complex and orderly systems that exist not despite the second law of thermodynamics, but because of it. Life and evolution, through natural selection of dissipative structures, are based on non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The challenge is to develop an understanding of what the respective physical laws can tell us about flows of energy and matter in living systems, and about growth, death and selection. This session will address current challenges including understanding emergence, regulation and control across scales, and entropy production, from metabolism in microbes to evolving ecosystems.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s exciting to me because I want to get back into work on thermodynamics and reaction networks, and we&#8217;ll have some excellent speakers on these topics.  I think the talks will be in this order&#8230; later I will learn the exact schedule.</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Heat flows adjust local ion concentrations in favor of prebiotic chemistry</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <strong>Abstract:</strong> Prebiotic reactions often require certain initial concentrations of ions. For example, the activity of RNA enzymes requires a lot of divalent magnesium salt, whereas too much monovalent sodium salt leads to a reduction in enzyme function. However, it is known from leaching experiments that prebiotically relevant geomaterial such as basalt releases mainly a lot of sodium and only little magnesium. A natural solution to this problem is heat fluxes through thin rock fractures, through which magnesium is actively enriched and sodium is depleted by thermogravitational convection and thermophoresis. This process establishes suitable conditions for ribozyme function from a basaltic leach. It can take place in a spatially distributed system of rock cracks and is therefore particularly stable to natural fluctuations and disturbances.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Stochastic chemical reaction networks</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <strong>Abstract:</strong> The study of chemical reaction networks (CRNs) is a very active field. Earlier well-known results (Feinberg Chem. Enc. Sci. 42 2229 (1987), Anderson et al Bull. Math. Biol. 72 1947 (2010)) identify a topological quantity called deficiency, easy to compute for CRNs of any size, which, when exactly equal to zero, leads to a unique factorized (non-equilibrium) steady-state for these networks. No general results exist however for the steady states of non-zero-deficiency networks. In recent work, we show how to write the full moment-hierarchy for any non-zero-deficiency CRN obeying mass-action kinetics, in terms of equations for the factorial moments. Using these, we can recursively predict values for lower moments from higher moments, reversing the procedure usually used to solve moment hierarchies. We show, for non-trivial examples, that in this manner we can predict any moment of interest, for CRNs with non-zero deficiency and non-factorizable steady states. It is however an open question how scalable these techniques are for large networks.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Nonequilibrium biomolecular information processes</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <strong>Abstract:</strong> Nearly 70 years have passed since the discovery of DNA structure and its role in coding genetic information. Yet, the kinetics and thermodynamics of genetic information processing in DNA replication, transcription, and translation remain poorly understood. These template-directed copolymerization processes are running away from equilibrium, being powered by extracellular energy sources. Recent advances show that their kinetic equations can be exactly solved in terms of so-called iterated function systems. Remarkably, iterated function systems can determine the effects of genome sequence on replication errors, up to a million times faster than kinetic Monte Carlo algorithms. With these new methods, fundamental links can be established between molecular information processing and the second law of thermodynamics, shedding a new light on genetic drift, mutations, and evolution.</p></blockquote>

The structure and foundations of MaxCal are much like those of Maximum Entropy for static distributions.  We have explored how MaxCal may serve as a general variational principle for nonequilibrium statistical physics &#8211; giving well-known results, such as the Green-Kubo relations, Onsager&#8217;s reciprocal relations and Prigogine&#8217;s Minimum Entropy Production principle near equilibrium, but is also applicable far from equilibrium.  I will also discuss some applications, such as finding reaction coordinates in molecular simulations non-linear dynamics in gene circuits, power-law-tail distributions in &#8220;social-physics&#8221; networks, and others.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Nonequilibrium dynamics of disturbed ecosystems</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <strong>Abstract:</strong> The Maximum Entropy Theory of Ecology (METE) predicts the shapes of macroecological metrics in relatively static ecosystems, across spatial scales, taxonomic categories, and habitats, using constraints imposed by static state variables. In disturbed ecosystems, however, with time-varying state variables, its predictions often fail. We extend macroecological theory from static to dynamic, by combining the MaxEnt inference procedure with explicit mechanisms governing disturbance. In the static limit, the resulting theory, DynaMETE, reduces to METE but also predicts a new scaling relationship among static state variables. Under disturbances, expressed as shifts in demographic, ontogenic growth, or migration rates, DynaMETE predicts the time trajectories of the state variables as well as the time-varying shapes of macroecological metrics such as the species abundance distribution and the distribution of metabolic rates over individuals. An iterative procedure for solving the dynamic theory is presented. Characteristic signatures of the deviation from static predictions of macroecological patterns are shown to result from different kinds of disturbance. By combining MaxEnt inference with explicit dynamical mechanisms of disturbance, DynaMETE is a candidate theory of macroecology for ecosystems responding to anthropogenic or natural disturbances.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldiers_Delight_Natural_Environment_Area">Soldiers Delight Natural Environmental Area</a>, a nature reserve in Maryland.  The early colonial records of Maryland describe the area as a hunting ground for Native Americans.  In 1693, rangers in the King&#8217;s service from a nearby garrison patrolled this area and named it Soldiers Delight, for some unknown reason.</p>
<p>It may not look like much, but that&#8217;s exactly the point!  In this otherwise lush land, why does it look like nothing but grass and a few scattered trees are growing here?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s because this area is a <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpentine_soil#Serpentine_barrens">serpentine barrens</a></strong>.   Serpentine is a kind of rock: actually a class of closely related minerals which get their name from their smooth or scaly green appearance.</p>
<div align="center"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpentine_subgroup#/media/File:Serpentyn,_2Polska.jpg"><img width="400" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Serpentyn%2C_2Polska.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>Soils formed from serpentine are toxic to many plants because they have lots of nickel, chromium, and cobalt!  Plants are also discouraged by how these soils have little potassium and phosphorus, not much calcium, and <i>too much</i>  magnesium. Serpentine, you see, is made of magnesium, silicon, iron, hydrogen and oxygen.</p>
<p>As a result, the plants that actually do well in serpentine barrens are very specialized: some small beautiful flowers, for example.  Indeed, there are nature reserves devoted to protecting these!  One of the most dramatic is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gros_Morne_National_Park#Tablelands">Tablelands</a> of Gros Morne National Park in Newfoundland:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:NLW_GrosMorne4_tango7174.jpg"><img width="450" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/NLW_GrosMorne4_tango7174.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>Scott Weidensaul writes this about the Tablelands:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  These are hardly garden spots, and virtually no animals live here except for birds and the odd caribou passing through.  Yet some plants manage to eke out a living.  Balsam ragwort, a relative of the cat&#8217;s-paw ragwort of the shale barrens, has managed to cope with the toxins and can tolerate up to 12 percent of its dry weight in magnesium&#8212;a concentration that would level most flowers.  Even the common pitcher-plant, a species normally associated with bogs, has a niche in this near-desert, growing along the edges of spring seeps where subsurface water brings up a little calcium.   By supplementing soil nourishment with a diet of insects trapped in its upright tubes, the pitcher-plant is able to augment the Tablelands&#8217; miserly offerings.  Several other carnivorous plants, including sundews and butterwort, work the same trick on their environment.
</p></blockquote>
<p>In North America, serpentine barrens can be found in the Appalachian Mountains&#8212;Gros Morne is at the northern end of these, and further south are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldiers_Delight_Natural_Environment_Area">Soldiers Delight Natural Environmental Area</a> in Maryland, and the <a href="https://www.nature.org/en-us/get-involved/how-to-help/places-we-protect/state-line-serpentine-barrens/">State Line Serpentine Barrens</a> on the border of Maryland and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>There are also serpentine barrens in the coastal ranges of California, Oregon, and Washington.  Here are some well-adapted flowers in the <a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/wildflowers/beauty/serpentines/">Klamath-Siskiyou Mountains</a> on the border of California and Oregon:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/wildflowers/beauty/serpentines/communities/barrens.shtml"><img width="440" src="https://www.fs.fed.us/wildflowers/beauty/serpentines/communities/images/barrens/images/Orobanche_fasciculata_Erwin.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>I first thought about serpentine when the Azimuth Project was exploring ways of sucking carbon dioxide from the air.  If you grind up serpentine and get it wet, it will absorb carbon dioxide!  A kilogram of serpentine can dispose about two-thirds of a kilogram of carbon dioxide.  So, people have suggested this as a way to fight global warming.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we&#8217;re putting out over 37 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide per year.  To absorb all of this we&#8217;d need to grind up about 55 gigatonnes of serpentine every year, spread it around, and get it wet.  There&#8217;s plenty of serpentine available, but this is over ten times the amount of worldwide cement production, so it would take a lot of work.  Then there&#8217;s the question of where to put all the ground-up rock.</p>
<p>And now I&#8217;ve learned that serpentine poses serious challenges to the growth of plant life!  It doesn&#8217;t much matter, given that nobody seems eager to fight global warming by grinding up huge amounts of this rock.  But it&#8217;s interesting.</p>

<p>A quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  It is crystal clear when you have entered the serpentine realm. There is no mistaking it, as the vegetation shift is sharp and dramatic. Full-canopied forests become sparse woodlands or barrens sometimes in a matter of a few feet. Dwarfed trees, low-lying shrubs, grassy patches, and rock characterize the dry, serpentine uplands. Carnivorous wetlands, meadows, and Port-Orford-cedar dominated riparian areas express the water that finds its way to the surface through fractured and faulted bedrock.

<p>The Japanese take pride in &#8216;shinise&#8217;: businesses that have lasted for hundreds or even thousands of years.  This points out an interesting alternative to the goal of profit maximization: maximizing the time of survival.</p>
<p>• Ben Dooley and Hisako Ueno, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/02/business/japan-old-companies.html?searchResultPosition=2">This Japanese shop is 1,020 years old. It knows a bit about surviving crises</a>, <i>New York Times</i>, 2 December 2020.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Such enterprises may be less dynamic than those in other countries. But their resilience offers lessons for businesses in places like the United States, where the coronavirus has forced tens of thousands into bankruptcy.</p>
<p>“If you look at the economics textbooks, enterprises are supposed to be maximizing profits, scaling up their size, market share and growth rate. But these companies’ operating principles are completely different,” said Kenji Matsuoka, a professor emeritus of business at Ryukoku University in Kyoto.</p>
<p>“Their No. 1 priority is carrying on,” he added. “Each generation is like a runner in a relay race. What’s important is passing the baton.”</p>
<p>Japan is an old-business superpower. The country is home to more than 33,000 with at least 100 years of history — over 40 percent of the world’s total. Over 3,100 have been running for at least two centuries. Around 140 have existed for more than 500 years. And at least 19 claim to have been continuously operating since the first millennium.</p>
<p>(Some of the oldest companies, including Ichiwa, cannot definitively trace their history back to their founding, but their timelines are accepted by the government, scholars and — in Ichiwa’s case — the competing mochi shop across the street.)</p>
<p>The businesses, known as “shinise,” are a source of both pride and fascination. Regional governments promote their products. Business management books explain the secrets of their success. And entire travel guides are devoted to them.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course if some businesses try to maximize time of survival, they may be small compared to businesses that are mainly trying to become &#8220;big&#8221;&#8212;at least if size is not the best road to long-term survival, which apparently it&#8217;s not.  So we&#8217;ll have short-lived dinosaurs tromping around, and, dodging their footsteps, long-lived mice.</p>
<p>The idea of different organisms pursuing different strategies is familiar in ecology, where people talk about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/K_selection_theory">r-selected and K-selected organisms</a>.  The former &#8220;emphasize high growth rates, typically exploit less-crowded ecological niches, and produce many offspring, each of which has a relatively low probability of surviving to adulthood.&#8221;  The latter &#8220;display traits associated with living at densities close to carrying capacity and typically are strong competitors in such crowded niches, that invest more heavily in fewer offspring, each of which has a relatively high probability of surviving to adulthood.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the contrast between r-selection and K-selection seems different to me than the contrast between profit maximization and lifespan maximization.  As far as I know, no organism except humans deliberately tries to maximize the lifetime of anything.</p>
<p>And amusingly, the theory of r-selection versus K-selection may also be nearing the end of its life:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  When Stearns reviewed the status of the theory in 1992, he noted that from 1977 to 1982 there was an average of 42 references to the theory per year in the BIOSIS literature search service, but from 1984 to 1989 the average dropped to 16 per year and continued to decline. He concluded that r/K theory was a once useful heuristic that no longer serves a purpose in life history theory.</p></blockquote>

<p>Among other things, she writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  We also found there to be a dark side to the success of these age-old shinise firms. At least half of the 17 companies we interviewed spoke of hardships in maintaining their high social status. They experienced peer pressure not to innovate (and solely focus on maintaining tradition) and had to make personal sacrifices to maintain their family and business continuity.</p>
<p>As the vice president of Shioyoshiken, a sweets company established in 1884, told us:</p>
<p><i>In a shinise, the firm is the same as the family. We need to sacrifice our own will and our own feelings and what we want to do … Inheriting and continuing the household is very important … We do not continue the business because we particularly like that industry. The fact that our family makes sweets is a coincidence. What is important is to continue the household as it is.</i></p>
<p>Innovations were sometimes discouraged by either the earlier family generation who were keen on maintaining the tradition, or peer shinise firms who cared about maintaining the tradition of the industry as a whole. Ultimately, we found that these businesses achieve such a long life through long-term sacrifice at both the personal and organisational level.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2020/09/29/fishers-fundamental-theorem-part-2/">Last time</a> we stated and proved a simple version of Fisher&#8217;s fundamental theorem of natural selection, which says that <i>under some conditions</i>, the rate of increase of the mean fitness equals the variance of the fitness.   But the conditions we gave were very restrictive: namely, that the fitness of each species of replicator is constant, not depending on how many of these replicators there are, or any other replicators.</p>
<p>To broaden the scope of Fisher&#8217;s fundamental theorem we need to do one of two things:</p>
<p>1) change the left side of the equation: talk about some other quantity other than rate of change of mean fitness.</p>
<p>2) change the right side of the question: talk about some other quantity than the variance in fitness.</p>
<p>Or we could do both!   <img src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/emoticons/tongue2.gif" />  People have spent a lot of time generalizing Fisher&#8217;s fundamental theorem.   I don&#8217;t think there are, or should be, any hard rules on what counts as a generalization.</p>
<p>But today we&#8217;ll take alternative 1).  We&#8217;ll show the square of something called the &#8216;Fisher speed&#8217; <i>always</i> equals the variance in fitness.  One nice thing about this result is that we can drop the restrictive condition I mentioned.   Another nice thing is that the Fisher speed is a concept from information theory!  It&#8217;s defined using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_information_metric">Fisher metric</a> on the space of probability distributions.</p>
<p>And yes&#8212;that metric is named after the same guy who proved Fisher&#8217;s fundamental theorem!  So, arguably, <i>Fisher</i> should have proved this generalization of Fisher&#8217;s fundamental theorem.  But in fact it seems that I was the first to prove it, around <a href="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/information/information_geometry_16.html">February 1st, 2017</a>.   Some similar results were already known, and I will discuss those someday.  But they&#8217;re a bit different.</p>
<p>A good way to think about the Fisher speed is that it&#8217;s &#8216;the rate at which information is being updated&#8217;.   A population of replicators of different species gives a probability distribution.  Like any probability distribution, this has information in it.   As the populations of our replicators change, the Fisher speed says the rate at which this information is being updated.  So, in simple terms, we&#8217;ll show</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The square of the rate at which information is updated is equal to the variance in fitness.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is quite a change from Fisher&#8217;s original idea, namely:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The rate of increase of mean fitness is equal to the variance in fitness.</p></blockquote>
<p>But it has the advantage of always being true&#8230; as long the population dynamics are described by the general framework we introduced last time.  So let me remind you of the general setup, and then prove the result!</p>
<h3> The setup</h3>
<p>We start out with population functions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_i+%5Ccolon+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D+%5Cto+%280%2C%5Cinfty%29%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="P_i &#92;colon &#92;mathbb{R} &#92;to (0,&#92;infty)," class="latex" /> one for each species of replicator <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i+%3D+1%2C%5Cdots%2Cn%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i = 1,&#92;dots,n," class="latex" /> obeying the <b>Lotka–Volterra equation</b></p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7Bd+P_i%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D+f_i%28P_1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+P_n%29+P_i+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{d P_i}{d t} = f_i(P_1, &#92;dots, P_n) P_i } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>for some differentiable functions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_i+%5Ccolon+%280%2C%5Cinfty%29+%5Cto+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_i &#92;colon (0,&#92;infty) &#92;to &#92;mathbb{R}" class="latex" /> called <b>fitness functions</b>.   The probability of a replicator being in the <i>i</i>th species is</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B++p_i%28t%29+%3D+%5Cfrac%7BP_i%28t%29%7D%7B%5Csum_j+P_j%28t%29%7D+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{  p_i(t) = &#92;frac{P_i(t)}{&#92;sum_j P_j(t)} } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Using the Lotka–Volterra equation we showed last time that these probabilities obey the <b>replicator equation</b></p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cdot%7Bp%7D_i+%3D+%5Cleft%28+f_i%28P%29+-+%5Coverline+f%28P%29+%5Cright%29++p_i+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;dot{p}_i = &#92;left( f_i(P) - &#92;overline f(P) &#92;right)  p_i } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Here <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="P" class="latex" /> is short for the whole list of populations <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28P_1%28t%29%2C+%5Cdots%2C+P_n%28t%29%29%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(P_1(t), &#92;dots, P_n(t))," class="latex" /> and</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Coverline+f%28P%29+%3D+%5Csum_j+f_j%28P%29+p_j++%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;overline f(P) = &#92;sum_j f_j(P) p_j  } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>is the <b>mean fitness</b>.</p>
<h3>The Fisher metric</h3>
<p>The space of probability distributions on the set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+n%5C%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;{1, &#92;dots, n&#92;}" class="latex" /> is called the <b>(n-1)-simplex</b></p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CDelta%5E%7Bn-1%7D+%3D+%5C%7B+%28x_1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+x_n%29+%3A+%5C%3B+x_i+%5Cge+0%2C+%5C%3B+%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5En+x_i+%3D+1+%7D+%5C%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;Delta^{n-1} = &#92;{ (x_1, &#92;dots, x_n) : &#92;; x_i &#92;ge 0, &#92;; &#92;displaystyle{ &#92;sum_{i=1}^n x_i = 1 } &#92;} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s called <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CDelta%5E%7Bn-1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;Delta^{n-1}" class="latex" /> because it&#8217;s (n-1)-dimensional.  When <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%3D+3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n = 3" class="latex" /> it looks like the letter <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CDelta%3A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;Delta:" class="latex" /></p>

<p>The <b>Fisher metric</b> is a Riemannian metric on the interior of the (n-1)-simplex.  That is, given a point <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p" class="latex" /> in the interior of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CDelta%5E%7Bn-1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;Delta^{n-1}" class="latex" /> and two tangent vectors <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v%2Cw&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="v,w" class="latex" /> at this point the Fisher metric gives a number</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g%28v%2Cw%29+%3D+%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5En+%5Cfrac%7Bv_i+w_i%7D%7Bp_i%7D++%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="g(v,w) = &#92;displaystyle{ &#92;sum_{i=1}^n &#92;frac{v_i w_i}{p_i}  } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Here we are describing the tangent vectors <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v%2Cw&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="v,w" class="latex" /> as vectors in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5En&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}^n" class="latex" /> with the property that the sum of their components is zero: that&#8217;s what makes them tangent to the (n-1)-simplex.  And we&#8217;re demanding that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> be in the interior of the simplex to avoid dividing by zero, since on the boundary of the simplex we have <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_i+%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p_i = 0" class="latex" /> for at least one choice of $i.$</p>
<p>If we have a probability distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%28t%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p(t)" class="latex" /> moving around in the interior of the (n-1)-simplex as a function of time, its <b>Fisher speed</b> is</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Csqrt%7Bg%28%5Cdot%7Bp%7D%28t%29%2C+%5Cdot%7Bp%7D%28t%29%29%7D+%3D+%5Csqrt%7B%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5En+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cdot%7Bp%7D_i%28t%29%5E2%7D%7Bp_i%28t%29%7D%7D+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;sqrt{g(&#92;dot{p}(t), &#92;dot{p}(t))} = &#92;sqrt{&#92;sum_{i=1}^n &#92;frac{&#92;dot{p}_i(t)^2}{p_i(t)}} } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>if the derivative <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdot%7Bp%7D%28t%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;dot{p}(t)" class="latex" /> exists.   This is the usual formula for the speed of a curve moving in a Riemannian manifold, specialized to the case at hand.</p>
<p>Now we&#8217;ve got all the formulas we&#8217;ll need to prove the result we want.  But for those who don&#8217;t already know and love it, it&#8217;s worthwhile saying a bit more about the Fisher metric.</p>
<p>The factor of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2Fx_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="1/x_i" class="latex" /> in the Fisher metric changes the geometry of the simplex so that it becomes <i>round</i>, like a portion of a sphere:</p>
<div align="center">

<p>But the reason the Fisher metric is important, I think, is its connection to relative information.  Given two probability distributions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%2C+q+%5Cin+%5CDelta%5E%7Bn-1%7D%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p, q &#92;in &#92;Delta^{n-1}," class="latex" /> the <b>information of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="q" class="latex" /> relative to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p" class="latex" /></b> is</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+I%28q%2Cp%29+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bi+%3D+1%7D%5En+q_i+%5Cln%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7Bq_i%7D%7Bp_i%7D%5Cright%29+++%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ I(q,p) = &#92;sum_{i = 1}^n q_i &#92;ln&#92;left(&#92;frac{q_i}{p_i}&#92;right)   } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>You can show this is the expected amount of information gained if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p" class="latex" /> was your prior distribution and you receive information that causes you to update your prior to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="q." class="latex" />   So, sometimes it&#8217;s called the <b>information gain</b>.  It&#8217;s also called <b>relative entropy</b> or&#8212;my least favorite, since it sounds so mysterious&#8212;the <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence">Kullback–Leibler divergence</a></b>.</p>
<p>Suppose <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%28t%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p(t)" class="latex" /> is a smooth curve in the interior of the (n-1)-simplex.  We can ask the rate at which information is gained as time passes.  Perhaps surprisingly, a calculation gives</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7Bd%7D%7Bdt%7D+I%28p%28t%29%2C+p%28t_0%29%29%5CBig%7C_%7Bt+%3D+t_0%7D+%3D+0+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{d}{dt} I(p(t), p(t_0))&#92;Big|_{t = t_0} = 0 } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>That is, in some sense &#8216;to first order&#8217; no information is being gained at any moment <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t_0+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="t_0 &#92;in &#92;mathbb{R}." class="latex" />   However, we have</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B++%5Cfrac%7Bd%5E2%7D%7Bdt%5E2%7D+I%28p%28t%29%2C+p%28t_0%29%29%5CBig%7C_%7Bt+%3D+t_0%7D+%3D++g%28%5Cdot%7Bp%7D%28t_0%29%2C+%5Cdot%7Bp%7D%28t_0%29%29%7D++&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{  &#92;frac{d^2}{dt^2} I(p(t), p(t_0))&#92;Big|_{t = t_0} =  g(&#92;dot{p}(t_0), &#92;dot{p}(t_0))}  " class="latex" /></p>
<p>So, the square of the Fisher speed has a nice interpretation in terms of relative entropy!</p>

<h3> The result</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s now extremely easy to show what we want, but let me state it formally so all the assumptions are crystal clear.</p>
<p><b>Theorem.</b>  Suppose the functions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_i+%5Ccolon+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D+%5Cto+%280%2C%5Cinfty%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="P_i &#92;colon &#92;mathbb{R} &#92;to (0,&#92;infty)" class="latex" /> obey the Lotka&#8211;Volterra equations:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cdot+P_i+%3D+f_i%28P%29+P_i%7D++&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;dot P_i = f_i(P) P_i}  " class="latex" /></p>
<p>for some differentiable functions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_i+%5Ccolon+%280%2C%5Cinfty%29%5En+%5Cto+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_i &#92;colon (0,&#92;infty)^n &#92;to &#92;mathbb{R}" class="latex" /> called fitness functions.   Define probabilities and the mean fitness as above, and define the <b>variance of the fitness</b> by</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cmathrm%7BVar%7D%28f%28P%29%29+%3D++%5Csum_j+%28+f_j%28P%29+-+%5Coverline+f%28P%29%29%5E2+%5C%2C+p_j+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;mathrm{Var}(f(P)) =  &#92;sum_j ( f_j(P) - &#92;overline f(P))^2 &#92;, p_j } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Then if none of the populations <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="P_i" class="latex" /> are zero, the square of the Fisher speed of the probability distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%28t%29+%3D+%28p_1%28t%29%2C+%5Cdots+%2C+p_n%28t%29%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p(t) = (p_1(t), &#92;dots , p_n(t))" class="latex" /> is the variance of the fitness:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g%28%5Cdot%7Bp%7D%2C+%5Cdot%7Bp%7D%29++%3D+%5Cmathrm%7BVar%7D%28f%28P%29%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="g(&#92;dot{p}, &#92;dot{p})  = &#92;mathrm{Var}(f(P)) " class="latex" /></p>
<p><b>Proof.</b> The proof is near-instantaneous.  We take the square of the Fisher speed:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+g%28%5Cdot%7Bp%7D%2C+%5Cdot%7Bp%7D%29+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5En+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cdot%7Bp%7D_i%28t%29%5E2%7D%7Bp_i%28t%29%7D+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ g(&#92;dot{p}, &#92;dot{p}) = &#92;sum_{i=1}^n &#92;frac{&#92;dot{p}_i(t)^2}{p_i(t)} } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>and plug in the replicator equation:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cdot%7Bp%7D_i+%3D+%28f_i%28P%29+-+%5Coverline+f%28P%29%29+p_i+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;dot{p}_i = (f_i(P) - &#92;overline f(P)) p_i } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>We obtain:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Bccl%7D+%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+g%28%5Cdot%7Bp%7D%2C+%5Cdot%7Bp%7D%29%7D+%26%3D%26++%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5En+%5Cleft%28+f_i%28P%29+-+%5Coverline+f%28P%29+%5Cright%29%5E2+p_i+%7D+%5C%5C+%5C%5C++%26%3D%26+%5Cmathrm%7BVar%7D%28f%28P%29%29++%5Cend%7Barray%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;begin{array}{ccl} &#92;displaystyle{ g(&#92;dot{p}, &#92;dot{p})} &amp;=&amp;  &#92;displaystyle{ &#92;sum_{i=1}^n &#92;left( f_i(P) - &#92;overline f(P) &#92;right)^2 p_i } &#92;&#92; &#92;&#92;  &amp;=&amp; &#92;mathrm{Var}(f(P))  &#92;end{array} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>as desired.   &nbsp; █</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to imagine anything simpler than this.  We see that given the Lotka–Volterra equation, what causes information to be updated is nothing more and nothing less than variance in fitness!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The National Institute of Mathematical and Biological Sciences is having an online seminar on &#8216;adaptive management&#8217;.  It should be fun for people who want to understand <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process">Markov decision processes</a>&#8212;like me!</p>
<p>• <a href="http://www.nimbios.org/tutorials/TT_adapt_webinars">NIMBioS Adaptive Management Webinar Series</a>, 2020 October 26-29 (Monday-Thursday).</p>
<blockquote><p> Adaptive management seeks to determine sound management strategies in the face of uncertainty concerning the behavior of the system being managed. Specifically, it attempts to find strategies for managing dynamic systems while learning the behavior of the system. These webinars review the key concept of a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and demonstrate how quantitative adaptive management strategies can be developed using MDPs. Additional conceptual, computational and application aspects will be discussed, including dynamic programming and Bayesian formalization of learning.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s how Fisher stated his fundamental theorem:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The rate of increase of fitness of any species is equal to the genetic variance in fitness.</p></blockquote>
<p>But clearly this is only going to be true under some conditions!</p>
<p>A lot of early criticism of Fisher&#8217;s fundamental theorem centered on the fact that the fitness of a species can vary due to changing external conditions.   For example: suppose the Sun goes supernova.  The fitness of all organisms on Earth will suddenly drop.  So the conclusions of Fisher&#8217;s theorem can&#8217;t hold under these circumstances.</p>
<p>I find this obvious and thus uninteresting.  So, let&#8217;s tackle situations where the fitness changes due to changing external conditions <i>later</i>. But <i>first</i> let&#8217;s see what happens if the fitness isn&#8217;t changing for these external reasons.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s &#8216;fitness&#8217;, anyway?    To define this we need a mathematical model of how populations change with time.  We&#8217;ll start with a very simple, very general model.  While it&#8217;s often used in population biology, it will have very little to do with biology <i>per se</i>.  Indeed, the reason I&#8217;m digging into Fisher&#8217;s fundamental theorem is that it has a mathematical aspect that doesn&#8217;t require much knowledge of biology to understand.  Applying it to biology introduces lots of complications and caveats, but that won&#8217;t be my main focus here.  I&#8217;m looking for the simple abstract core.</p>
<h3> The Lotka&#8211;Volterra equation</h3>
<p>The Lotka&#8211;Volterra equation is a simplified model of how populations change with time.  Suppose we have <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" /> different types of self-replicating entity.  We will call these entities <b>replicators</b>.  We will call the types of replicators <b>species</b>, but they do not need to be species in the biological sense!</p>
<p>For example, the replicators could be organisms of one single biological species, and the types could be different genotypes.   Or the replicators could be genes, and the types could be alleles.    Or the replicators could be restaurants, and the types could be restaurant chains.  In what follows these details won&#8217;t matter: we&#8217;ll have just have different &#8216;species&#8217; of &#8216;replicators&#8217;.</p>
<p>Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_i%28t%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="P_i(t)" class="latex" /> or just <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="P_i" class="latex" /> for short, be the population of the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i" class="latex" />th species at time <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="t." class="latex" />  We will treat this population as a differentiable real-valued function of time, which is a reasonable approximation when the population is fairly large.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s assume the population obeys the <b>Lotka&#8211;Volterra equation</b>:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7Bd+P_i%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D+f_i%28P_1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+P_n%29+%5C%2C+P_i+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{d P_i}{d t} = f_i(P_1, &#92;dots, P_n) &#92;, P_i } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>where each function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_i" class="latex" /> depends in a differentiable way on all the populations.  Thus each population <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="P_i" class="latex" /> changes at a rate proportional to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_i%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="P_i," class="latex" /> but the &#8216;constant of proportionality&#8217; need not be constant: it depends on the populations of all the species.</p>
<p>We call <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_i" class="latex" /> the <b>fitness function</b> of the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i" class="latex" />th species.  Note: we are assuming this function does not depend on time.</p>
<p>To write the Lotka&#8211;Volterra equation more concisely, we can create a vector whose components are all the populations:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P+%3D+%28P_1%2C+%5Cdots+%2C+P_n%29.+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="P = (P_1, &#92;dots , P_n). " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s call this the <b>population vector</b>.  In terms of the population vector, the Lotka&#8211;Volterra equation become</p>

<p>To define concepts like &#8216;mean fitness&#8217; or &#8216;variance in fitness&#8217; we need to introduce probability theory, and the replicator equation.</p>
<h3> The replicator equation</h3>
<p>Starting from the populations <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="P_i" class="latex" />, we can work out the probability <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p_i" class="latex" /> that a randomly chosen replicator belongs to the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i" class="latex" />th species.   More precisely, this is the fraction of replicators belonging to that species:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B++p_i+%3D+%5Cfrac%7BP_i%7D%7B%5Csum_j+P_j%7D+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{  p_i = &#92;frac{P_i}{&#92;sum_j P_j} } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>As a mnemonic, remember that the big <b>P</b>opulation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="P_i" class="latex" /> is being normalized to give a little <b>p</b>robability <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_i.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p_i." class="latex" />  I once had someone scold me for two minutes during a talk I was giving on this subject, for using lower-case and upper-case P&#8217;s to mean different things.   But it&#8217;s my blog and I&#8217;ll do what I want to.</p>
<p>How do these probabilities <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p_i" class="latex" /> change with time?  We can figure this out using the Lotka&#8211;Volterra equation.   We pull out the trusty quotient rule and calculate:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cdot%7Bp%7D_i+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cdot%7BP%7D_i+%5Cleft%28%5Csum_j+P_j%5Cright%29+-+P_i+%5Cleft%28%5Csum_j+%5Cdot%7BP%7D_j+%5Cright%29%7D%7B%5Cleft%28++%5Csum_j+P_j+%5Cright%29%5E2+%7D+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;dot{p}_i = &#92;frac{&#92;dot{P}_i &#92;left(&#92;sum_j P_j&#92;right) - P_i &#92;left(&#92;sum_j &#92;dot{P}_j &#92;right)}{&#92;left(  &#92;sum_j P_j &#92;right)^2 } }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>Then the Lotka–Volterra equation gives</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cdot%7Bp%7D_i+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B+f_i%28P%29+P_i+%5C%3B+%5Cleft%28%5Csum_j+P_j%5Cright%29+-+P_i+%5Cleft%28%5Csum_j+f_j%28P%29+P_j+%5Cright%29%7D+%7B%5Cleft%28++%5Csum_j+P_j+%5Cright%29%5E2+%7D+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;dot{p}_i = &#92;frac{ f_i(P) P_i &#92;; &#92;left(&#92;sum_j P_j&#92;right) - P_i &#92;left(&#92;sum_j f_j(P) P_j &#92;right)} {&#92;left(  &#92;sum_j P_j &#92;right)^2 } }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>Using the definition of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p_i" class="latex" /> this simplifies and we get</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cdot%7Bp%7D_i+%3D++f_i%28P%29+p_i++-+%5Cleft%28+%5Csum_j+f_j%28P%29+p_j+%5Cright%29+p_i+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;dot{p}_i =  f_i(P) p_i  - &#92;left( &#92;sum_j f_j(P) p_j &#92;right) p_i } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>The expression in parentheses here has a nice meaning: it is the <b>mean fitness</b>.  In other words, it is the average, or expected, fitness of a replicator chosen at random from the whole population.  Let us write it thus:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Coverline+f%28P%29+%3D+%5Csum_j+f_j%28P%29+p_j++%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;overline f(P) = &#92;sum_j f_j(P) p_j  } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>This gives the <b>replicator equation</b> in its classic form:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cdot%7Bp%7D_i+%3D+%5Cleft%28+f_i%28P%29+-+%5Coverline+f%28P%29+%5Cright%29+%5C%2C+p_i+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;dot{p}_i = &#92;left( f_i(P) - &#92;overline f(P) &#92;right) &#92;, p_i } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>where the dot stands for a time derivative. Thus, for the fraction of replicators of the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i" class="latex" />th species to increase, their fitness must exceed the mean fitness.</p>
<p>The moral is clear:</p>

<h3> The fundamental theorem</h3>
<p>What does the fundamental theorem of natural selection say, in this context?  It says <i>the rate of increase in mean fitness is equal to the variance of the fitness</i>.   As an equation, it says this:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7Bd%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%5Coverline+f%28P%29+%3D+%5Csum_j+%5CBig%28+f_j%28P%29+-+%5Coverline+f%28P%29+%5CBig%29%5E2+%5C%2C+p_j++%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{d}{d t} &#92;overline f(P) = &#92;sum_j &#92;Big( f_j(P) - &#92;overline f(P) &#92;Big)^2 &#92;, p_j  } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>The left hand side is the rate of increase in mean fitness&#8212;or decrease, if it&#8217;s negative.  The right hand side is the variance of the fitness: the thing whose square root is the standard deviation.  This can never be negative!</p>
<p>A little calculation suggests that there&#8217;s <i>no way in the world</i> that this equation can be true without extra assumptions!</p>
<p>We can start computing the left hand side:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Bccl%7D+%5Cdisplaystyle%7B%5Cfrac%7Bd%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%5Coverline+f%28P%29%7D++%26%3D%26++%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7Bd%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%5Csum_j+f_j%28P%29+p_j+%7D+%5C%5C++%5C%5C++%26%3D%26+%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Csum_j++%5Cfrac%7Bd+f_j%28P%29%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%5C%2C+p_j+%5C%3B+%2B+%5C%3B+f_j%28P%29+%5C%2C+%5Cfrac%7Bd+p_j%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%7D+%5C%5C+%5C%5C++%26%3D%26+%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Csum_j+%28%5Cnabla+f_j%28P%29+%5Ccdot+%5Cdot%7BP%7D%29+p_j+%5C%3B+%2B+%5C%3B+f_j%28P%29+%5Cdot%7Bp%7D_j+%7D++%5Cend%7Barray%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;begin{array}{ccl} &#92;displaystyle{&#92;frac{d}{d t} &#92;overline f(P)}  &amp;=&amp;  &#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{d}{d t} &#92;sum_j f_j(P) p_j } &#92;&#92;  &#92;&#92;  &amp;=&amp; &#92;displaystyle{ &#92;sum_j  &#92;frac{d f_j(P)}{d t} &#92;, p_j &#92;; + &#92;; f_j(P) &#92;, &#92;frac{d p_j}{d t} } &#92;&#92; &#92;&#92;  &amp;=&amp; &#92;displaystyle{ &#92;sum_j (&#92;nabla f_j(P) &#92;cdot &#92;dot{P}) p_j &#92;; + &#92;; f_j(P) &#92;dot{p}_j }  &#92;end{array} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Before your eyes glaze over, let&#8217;s look at the two terms and think about what they mean.  The first term says: the mean fitness will change since the fitnesses <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_j%28P%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_j(P)" class="latex" /> depend on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="P," class="latex" /> which is changing.   The second term says: the mean fitness will change since the fraction <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_j&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p_j" class="latex" /> of replicators that are in the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="j" class="latex" />th species is changing.</p>
<p>We could continue the computation by using the Lotka&#8211;Volterra equation for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdot%7BP%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;dot{P}" class="latex" /> and the replicator equation for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdot%7Bp%7D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;dot{p}." class="latex" />   But it already looks like we&#8217;re doomed without invoking an extra assumption.  The left hand side of Fisher&#8217;s fundamental theorem involves the gradients of the fitness functions, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla+f_j%28P%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;nabla f_j(P)." class="latex" />   The right hand side:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Csum_j+%5CBig%28+f_j%28P%29+-+%5Coverline+f%28P%29+%5CBig%29%5E2+%5C%2C+p_j++%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;sum_j &#92;Big( f_j(P) - &#92;overline f(P) &#92;Big)^2 &#92;, p_j  } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>does not!</p>
<p>This suggests an extra assumption we can make.  Let&#8217;s assume those gradients <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla+f_j&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;nabla f_j" class="latex" /> vanish!</p>
<p>In other words, let&#8217;s assume that the fitness of each replicator is a <i>constant</i>, independent of the populations:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_j%28P_1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+P_n%29+%3D+f_j+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_j(P_1, &#92;dots, P_n) = f_j " class="latex" /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_j&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_j" class="latex" /> at right is just a <i>number</i>.</p>
<p>Then we can redo our computation of the rate of change of mean fitness.   The gradient term doesn&#8217;t appear:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Bccl%7D+%5Cdisplaystyle%7B%5Cfrac%7Bd%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%5Coverline+f%28P%29%7D++%26%3D%26++%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7Bd%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%5Csum_j+f_j+p_j+%7D+%5C%5C++%5C%5C++%26%3D%26+%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Csum_j+f_j+%5Cdot%7Bp%7D_j+%7D++%5Cend%7Barray%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;begin{array}{ccl} &#92;displaystyle{&#92;frac{d}{d t} &#92;overline f(P)}  &amp;=&amp;  &#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{d}{d t} &#92;sum_j f_j p_j } &#92;&#92;  &#92;&#92;  &amp;=&amp; &#92;displaystyle{ &#92;sum_j f_j &#92;dot{p}_j }  &#92;end{array} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>We can use the replicator equation for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdot%7Bp%7D_j&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;dot{p}_j" class="latex" /> and get</p>

<p>This is the mean of the squares of the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_j&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_j" class="latex" /> minus the square of their mean.   And if you&#8217;ve done enough probability theory, you&#8217;ll recognize this as the variance!  Remember, the variance is</p>

<p>Same thing.</p>

<p>Then the time derivative of the mean fitness is the variance of the fitness:</p>

<p>This is nice&#8212;but as you can see, our extra assumption that the fitness functions are constants has trivialized the problem.  The equations</p>

<p>are easy to solve: all the populations change exponentially with time.  We&#8217;re not seeing any of the interesting features of population biology, or even of dynamical systems in general.   The theorem is just an observation about a collection of exponential functions growing or shrinking at different rates.</p>
<p>So, we should look for a more interesting theorem in this vicinity!   And we will.</p>
<p>Before I bid you adieu, let&#8217;s record a result we almost reached, but didn&#8217;t yet state.  It&#8217;s stronger than the one I just stated.  In this version we don&#8217;t assume the fitness functions are constant, so we keep the term involving their gradient.</p>
<blockquote><p>

<p>and the <b>variance of the fitness</b> by</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cmathrm%7BVar%7D%28f%28P%29%29+%3D++%5Csum_j+%5CBig%28+f_j%28P%29+-+%5Coverline+f%28P%29+%5CBig%29%5E2+%5C%2C+p_j+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;mathrm{Var}(f(P)) =  &#92;sum_j &#92;Big( f_j(P) - &#92;overline f(P) &#92;Big)^2 &#92;, p_j } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Then the time derivative of the mean fitness is the variance plus an extra term involving the gradients of the fitness functions:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B%5Cfrac%7Bd%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%5Coverline+f%28P%29%7D++%3D++%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cmathrm%7BVar%7D%28f%28P%29%29+%2B+%5Csum_j+%28%5Cnabla+f_j%28P%29+%5Ccdot+%5Cdot%7BP%7D%29+p_j+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{&#92;frac{d}{d t} &#92;overline f(P)}  =  &#92;displaystyle{ &#92;mathrm{Var}(f(P)) + &#92;sum_j (&#92;nabla f_j(P) &#92;cdot &#92;dot{P}) p_j } " class="latex" /></p></blockquote>
<p>The proof just amounts to cobbling together the calculations we have already done, and not assuming the gradient term vanishes.</p>
<h3> Acknowledgements</h3>
<p>After writing this blog article I looked for a nice picture to grace it.  I found one here:</p>
<p>• David Wakeham, <a href="https://hapax.github.io/mathematics/biology/replicators/">Replicators and Fisher&#8217;s fundamental theorem</a>, 30 November 2017.</p>
<p>I was mildly chagrined to discover that he said most of what I just said more simply and cleanly&#8230; in part because he went straight to the case where the fitness functions are constants.     But my mild chagrin was instantly offset by this remark:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Fisher likened the result to the second law of thermodynamics, but there is an amusing amount of disagreement about what Fisher meant and whether he was correct. Rather than look at Fisher’s tortuous proof (or the only slightly less tortuous results of latter-day interpreters) I’m going to look at a <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/information/information_geometry_16.html">simpler setup</a> due to John Baez, and (unlike Baez) use it to derive the original version of Fisher’s theorem.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, I&#8217;m just catching up with Wakeham, but luckily an earlier blog article of mine helped him avoid &#8220;Fisher&#8217;s tortuous proof&#8221; and the &#8220;only slightly less tortuous results of latter-day interpreters&#8221;.  We are making progress here!</p>
<p>(By the way, a quiz show I listen to recently asked about the difference between &#8220;tortuous&#8221; and &#8220;torturous&#8221;.  They mean very different things, but this particular case either word would apply.)</p>
<p>My earlier blog article, in turn, was inspired by this paper:</p>
<p>• Marc Harper, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.1383">Information geometry and evolutionary game theory</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are various &#8216;fundamental theorems&#8217; in mathematics.  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic">fundamental theorem of arithmetic</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_algebra">fundamental theorem of algebra</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus">fundamental theorem of calculus</a> are three of the most famous.  These are gems of mathematics.</p>
<p>The statistician, biologist and eugenicist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher">Ronald Fisher</a> had his own fundamental theorem: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%27s_fundamental_theorem_of_natural_selection">&#8216;fundamental theorem of natural selection&#8217;</a>.  But this one is different&#8212;it&#8217;s a mess!  The theorem was based on confusing definitions, Fisher&#8217;s proofs were packed with typos and downright errors, and people don&#8217;t agree on what the theorem says, whether it&#8217;s correct, and whether it&#8217;s nontrivial.  Thus, people keep trying to clarify and strengthen it.</p>
<p>This paper analyzes Fisher&#8217;s work:</p>
<p>• George R. Price, <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.366.4070&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Fisher&#8217;s &#8216;fundamental theorem&#8217; made clear</a>, <i>Annals of Human Genetics</i> <b>32</b> (1972), 129–140.</p>
<p>Price writes:</p>
<blockquote><p> It has long been a mystery how Fisher (1930, 1941, 1958) derived his famous &#8216;fundamental theorem of Natural Selection&#8217; and exactly what he meant by it. He stated the theorem in these words (1930, p. 35; 1958, p. 37): &#8216;The rate of increase in fitness of any organism at any time is equal to its genetic variance in fitness at that time.&#8217; And also in these words (1930, p. 46; 1958, p. 50): &#8216;The rate of increase of fitness of any species is equal to the genetic variance in fitness.&#8217; He compared this result to the second law of thermodynamics, and described it as holding &#8216;the supreme position among the biological sciences&#8217;. Also, he spoke of the &#8216;rigour&#8217; of his derivation of the theorem and of &#8216;the ease of its interpretation&#8217;. But others have variously described his derivation as &#8216;recondite&#8217; (Crow &amp; Kimura, 1970), &#8216;very difficult&#8217; (Turner, 1970), or &#8216;entirely obscure&#8217; (Kempthorne, 1957). And no one has ever found any other way to derive the result that Fisher seems to state. Hence, many authors (not reviewed here) have maintained that the theorem holds only under very special conditions, while only a few (e.g. Edwards, 1967) have thought that Fisher may have been correct&#8212;if only we could understand what he meant!</p>
<p>It will be shown here that this latter view is correct. Fisher&#8217;s theorem does indeed hold with the generality that he claimed for it. The mystery and the controversy result from incomprehensibility rather than error.</p></blockquote>
<p>I won&#8217;t try to explain the result here&#8212;or the various improved versions that people have invented, which may actually be more interesting than the original.  I&#8217;ll try to do this in a series of posts.  Right now I just want to quote Price&#8217;s analysis of why Fisher&#8217;s result is so difficult to understand!  It&#8217;s amusing:</p>
<blockquote><p>In addition to the central confusion resulting from the use of the word fitness in two highly different senses, Fisher&#8217;s three publications on his theorem contain an astonishing number of lesser obscurities, infelicities of expression, typographical errors, omissions of crucial explanations, and contradictions between different passages about the same point. It is necessary to clarify some of this confusion before explaining the derivation of the theorem.</p></blockquote>
<p>He analyzes the problems in detail, calling one passage &#8220;most confusing published scientific writing I know of&#8221;.</p>
<p><i>Part</i> of the problem, though only part, is that Fisher rewrote part of his paper while not remembering to change the rest to make the terminology match.   It reminds me a bit of how the typesetter accidentally omitted a line from one of Bohr&#8217;s papers on quantum mechanics, creating a sentence that made absolutely no sense&#8212;though in Bohr&#8217;s case, his writing was so obscure that nobody even noticed until many years later.</p>
<p>Given its legendary obscurity, I will <em>not</em> try to fight my way through Fisher&#8217;s original paper.  I will start with some later work.  Next time!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I keep putting off organizing my written material, but with coronavirus I&#8217;m feeling more mortal than usual, so I&#8217;d like get this out into the world now:</p>
<p>• John Baez, <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/diary/diary_pdfs/baez_diary_2003-2020.pdf">Diary, 2003&#8211;2020</a>.</p>
<p>Go ahead and grab a copy!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s got all my best tweets and Google+ posts, mainly explaining math and physics, but also my travel notes and other things&#8230; starting in 2003 with my ruminations on economics and ecology. It&#8217;s too big to read all at once, but I think you can dip into it more or less anywhere and pull out something fun.</p>
<p>It goes up to July 2020. It&#8217;s 2184 pages long.</p>
<p>I fixed a few problems like missing pictures, but there are probably more. If you let me know about them, I&#8217;ll fix them (if it&#8217;s easy).</p>
