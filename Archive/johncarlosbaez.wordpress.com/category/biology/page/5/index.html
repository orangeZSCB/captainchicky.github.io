					<p>I&#8217;m going to try posting more short articles here.  I often read papers and want to jot down a few notes about them.  I&#8217;ve avoided doing that here, on the theory that articles here should be beautiful works of art.  Now I&#8217;ll try being a bit more relaxed.  I hope you ask questions, or fill in details I leave out.</p>
<p>My former grad student Mike Stay has become fascinated by the <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2015/05/a_2categorical_approach_to_the.html">pi-calculus</a> as model of computation.   The more famous lambda-calculus is a simple model of functional programming: each expression in this calculus can be seen as a program, or a description of a function.  The pi-calculus can do all the same things, but more: it models processes that can compute but also create channels and send messages to each other along these channels.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m trying to use network theory to understand the essence of biology in a very simplified way.   I&#8217;m not convinced that the pi-calculus is the right formalism for this.  But some people are trying to apply it to cell biology, so I want to learn what they&#8217;re doing.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m especially fascinated by this paper, and I&#8217;d like to understand it in detail:</p>
<p>&bull; Davide Chiarugi, Pierpaolo Degano and Roberto Marangoni, <a href="http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030174">A computational approach to the functional screening of genomes</a>, <em>PLoS Computational Biology</em>, 28 September 2007.</p>
<p>They used a framework for describing computational networks, the &#8220;enhanced pi-calculus&#8221;, to help find a minimal set of genes required for the survival of a bacterial cell.  If we knew this, it would help us make a guess for the genome of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_universal_ancestor">Last Universal Ancestor</a>.  This is the most recent ancestor of all organisms now living on Earth&#8212;some single-celled guy, between 3.5 and 3.8 billion years old.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not mainly interested in understanding the Last Universal Ancestor: I&#8217;m mainly interested in understanding a very simple form of life.  So, I want to find what sort of equations they&#8217;re using to describe what happens in a cell&#8230; and how they&#8217;re converting their pi-calculus model to those equations. Unfortunately this paper doesn&#8217;t say, and it doesn&#8217;t seem like their code is open-source.  But I&#8217;ll poke around.</p>
<p>I know how to use <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/stoch_stable.pdf">Petri nets</a> to model chemical reactions.  In their paper they mildly disparage these, and refer to other papers on this general issue.  So, I should read that stuff.  But I want to see whether Petri nets are merely <em>inconvenient</em> for them, or <em>insufficiently powerful to describe their model</em>.</p>
<p>I especially want to see if their model includes processes involving membranes, like the cell membrane, since Petri nets are not really suited to these.  A eukaryotic cell has lots of organelles with membranes, so we will need some kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_computing">&#8216;membrane calculus&#8217;</a> to understand it, and I&#8217;ve been gradually gearing up to understand that.  But it&#8217;s possible their prokaryotic cell is just treated as a single bag of chemicals all of which can freely react with each other.  Petri nets would suffice for this!</p>
<p>They write:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The π-calculus was designed to express, run, and reason about concurrent systems. These are abstract systems composed of processes, i.e., autonomous, independent processing units that run in parallel and eventually communicate, by exchanging messages through channels. A biochemical reaction between two metabolites, catalyzed by an enzyme, can be modeled in π-calculus as a communication. The two metabolites are represented by two processes, and, in our approach, the enzyme is modeled as the channel which permits the communication.</p>
<p>  In addition to communications, the π-calculus also allows us to specify silent internal actions, used to model those activities of the cell, the details of which we are not interested in (e.g., the pure presence of a catalyst in a reaction, where it is not actively involved). The calculus has the means to express alternative behavior, when a metabolite can act in different possible manners: the way to follow is chosen according to a given probability distribution.</p>
<p>  The main difference between the standard π-calculus and the enhanced version we used in this work is the notion of address. An address is a unique identifier of a process, totally transparent to the user, automatically assigned to all of its child subprocesses. This labeling technique helps in tracking the history of virtual metabolites and reasoning about computations, in a purely mechanical way. In particular, stochastic implementation or causality are kept implicit and are recovered as needed.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I would also like to understand all the chemical reactions that occur in their minimal model of a cell.  They started by simulating an already known model, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_genome">&#8216;minimal gene set&#8217;</a> or &#8216;MGS&#8217;:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The MGS-prokaryote has been exhaustively described in the enhanced π-calculus. We represented the 237 genes, their relative products, and the metabolic pathways expressed and regulated by the genes, as the corresponding processes and channels. In particular: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycolysis">glycolytic pathway</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentose_phosphate_pathway">pentose phosphate pathway</a>, the pathways involved in nucleotide, aminoacids, coenzyme, lipids, and glycerol metabolism. Moreover, MGS genes encode for a set of membrane carriers for metabolite uptake, including the PTS carrier. We placed this virtual cell in an optimal virtual environment, in which all nutrients and water were available, and where no problems were present in eliminating waste substances.
</p></blockquote>
<p>However, they found that a cell described by this minimal gene set would soon die!  So, they added more features until they got a cell that could survive.</p>
<p>This seems like a fun way to learn a manageable amount of biochemistry.  I&#8217;m less interested in knowing all the molecules on a first-name basis than in getting a rough overview of what goes on the simplest organisms.</p>
<p>Many of the processes mentioned above seem adequately described by chemical reaction networks&#8212;or in other words, Petri nets. For example, here is the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycolysis">glycolytic pathway</a>:</p>
<p><img width="450" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Glycolysis_metabolic_pathway_3.svg/600px-Glycolysis_metabolic_pathway_3.svg.png" /></p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t know what the &#8216;PTS carrier&#8217; is, but Graham Jones helped out, writing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEP_group_translocation">Wikipedia says</a> the &#8216;phosphotransferase system or PTS, is a distinct method used by bacteria for sugar uptake where the source of energy is from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP).&#8217;)</p>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote><p>
Pyruvate is then converted to acetate which, being a catabolite, can diffuse out of the cell. A transmembrane reduced-NAD dehydrogenase complex catalyzes the oxidation of reduced-NAD; this reaction is coupled with the synthesis of ATP through the ATP synthase/ATPase transmembrane system. This set of reactions enables the cell to manage its energetic metabolism.
</p></blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote><p>
The cell “imports” fatty acids, glycerol, and some other metabolites, e.g., choline, and uses them for the synthesis of triglycerides and phospholipids; these are essential components of the plasma membrane. (plasma membrane = cell membrane).
</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess that a Petri net could suffice, with some tricks to represent the environment outside the cell. But I think it would need to be stochastic, not just differential equations, because some processes would involve a single copy, or a tiny number of copies, of a molecule.
</p></blockquote>

<div align="center"><a href="http://ngonewsafrica.org/archives/927"></a><img width="450" src="https://johncarlosbaez.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/708e1-mosquitonet-710885.jpg?w=450" /></div>
<p>Malaria is a nasty disease, caused by mosquitoes infected with parasites. If you catch malaria, you get feverish and tired. You have headaches, and vomit.  If you&#8217;re unlucky you may have seizures, fall into a coma and even die.</p>
<p>Almost 200 million people got malaria in 2013. Somewhere between 500,000 and a million died. 90% of these people lived in Africa.</p>
<p>This is good news???</p>
<p>Yes, it is! Since 2000, malaria funding has increased nearly tenfold. From 2000 to 2015, cases of malaria in Africa dropped by 40%. Thanks to this, over 600 million cases of malaria have been avoided!</p>
<p>The main reason? Insecticide-treated nets. If you sleep with one of these over your bed, you&#8217;re less likely to get bitten by a mosquito.</p>
<p>And how are people getting these nets? The <a href="http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/malaria/">Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria</a>, founded in 2002, has distributed 548 million of them. They provide about half the international funding for malaria control worldwide.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Health/Malaria">Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</a> is helping. They&#8217;ve spent almost $2 billion to fight malaria. They&#8217;ve also contributed $1.6 billion to the Global Fund.</p>
<p>The war against malaria is far from won. One of the main drugs used to fight it is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemisinin">artemisinin</a>. But a strain that&#8217;s resistant to artemisinin is <a href="http://who.int/malaria/media/artemisinin_resistance_qa/en/">spreading near the border of Thailand and Cambodia</a>.</p>
<p>A vaccine would be great. But there&#8217;s no vaccine yet. And it&#8217;s not easy: malaria is actually caused by several different organisms. Still, stopping just a few of the main culprits would be great.</p>
<p>New technology can change the game.  On November 23rd, something amazing happened.</p>
<p>A team of scientists from the University of California announced that they had gotten mosquitoes to pass on malaria resistance genes to almost all their children&#8212;not just half, as you&#8217;d normally expect!</p>
<p>With this method, malaria resistance could spread through the mosquito population like wildfire.</p>
<p>This method is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_drive">gene drive</a>, and it was implemented using a system called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR">CRISPR</a>. If you haven&#8217;t heard about these things, it&#8217;s time to do some reading! I&#8217;ll give you some links below.</p>
<p>Being sensible and cautious, the scientists have not tested this method in the wild yet. They could do it in less than a year&#8212;but they&#8217;re in no rush.  Said Anthony James:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  It’s not going to go anywhere until the social science advances to the point where we can handle it. We’re not about to do anything foolish.
</p></blockquote>
<p>It may be good to test it on a remote island, where mosquitoes can&#8217;t fly to another place.</p>
<p>Gene drives are simultaneously very promising and quite scary. If we used one to spread malaria resistance among mosquitoes we could save half a million lives each year &#8211; and let poor countries spend their resources on something better.</p>
<p>We are gaining the power to do many things. We just need some wisdom to go along with this power. In fact, many of us have that wisdom. We just need to get better at making it prevail.</p>

				<h2><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/12/21/operads-and-phylogenetic-trees/" rel="bookmark">Operads and Phylogenetic&nbsp;Trees</a></h2>
				<small>21 December, 2015</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>A few years ago, after hearing <a href="http://statweb.stanford.edu/~susan/">Susan Holmes</a> speak about the mathematics of phylogenetic trees, I became interested in their connection to algebraic topology. I wrote an article about this here:</p>
<p>• John Baez, <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/07/06/operads-and-the-tree-of-life/">Operads and the tree of life</a>, 6 July 2011.</p>
<p>In trying to the make the ideas precise I recruited the help of <a href="https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/nina.otter">Nina Otter</a>, who was then a graduate student at ETH Zürich. She came to Riverside and we started to work together.</p>
<p>Now Nina is a grad student at Oxford working on mathematical biology with <a href="http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/harrington/">Heather Harrington</a>. I visited her last summer and we made more progress&#8230; but then she realized that our paper needed another big theorem, a result relating our topology on the space of phylogenetic trees to the topology described by Susan Holmes and her coauthors here:</p>
<p>• Louis J. Billera, Susan P. Holmes and Karen Vogtmann, <a href="http://finmath.stanford.edu/~susan/papers/lap.pdf">Geometry of the space of phylogenetic trees</a>, <i>Advances in Applied Mathematics</i> <b>27</b> (2001), 733&#8211;767.</p>
<p>It took another half year to finish things up. I could never have done this myself.</p>
<p>But now we&#8217;re done! Here&#8217;s our paper:</p>
<p>• John Baez and Nina Otter, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03337">Operads and phylogenetic trees</a>.</p>
<h3>The basic idea</h3>
<p>Trees are important, not only in mathematics, but also biology. The most important is the &#8216;tree of life&#8217; relating all organisms that have ever lived on Earth. Darwin drew this sketch of it in 1837:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ecological/phylo/darwin_tree.jpg" alt="" width="450" /></div>
<p>He wrote about it in <i>On the Origin of Species</i></p>
<blockquote><p>The affinities of all the beings of the same class have sometimes been represented by a great tree. I believe this simile largely speaks the truth. The green and budding twigs may represent existing species; and those produced during former years may represent the long succession of extinct species. At each period of growth all the growing twigs have tried to branch out on all sides, and to overtop and kill the surrounding twigs and branches, in the same manner as species and groups of species have at all times overmastered other species in the great battle for life.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now we know that the tree of life is not really a tree in the mathematical sense. One reason is &#8216;endosymbiosis&#8217;: the incorporation of one organism together with its genetic material into another, as probably happened with the mitochondria in our cells and also the plastids that hold chlorophyll in plants. Another is &#8216;horizontal gene transfer&#8217;: the passing of genetic material from one organism to another, which happens frequently with bacteria. So, the tree of life is really a thicket:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ecological/phylo/horizontal_gene_transfer.jpg" alt="" width="450" /></div>
<p>But a tree is often a good approximation, especially for animals and plants in the last few hundred million years. Biologists who try to infer phylogenetic trees from present-day genetic data often use simple models where:</p>
<p>• the genotype of each species follows a random walk, but</p>
<p>• species branch in two at various times.</p>
<p>These are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Models_of_DNA_evolution">&#8216;Markov models&#8217;</a>. The simplest Markov model for DNA evolution is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Models_of_DNA_evolution#JC69_model_.28Jukes_and_Cantor.2C_1969.29.5B1.5D">Jukes–Cantor model</a>. Consider one or more pieces of DNA having a total of <i>n</i> base pairs. We can think of this as a string of letters chosen from the set {A,T,C,G}:</p>
<div align="center">&#8230;ATCGATTGAGCTCTAGCG&#8230;</div>
<p>As time passes, the Jukes–Cantor model says the DNA changes randomly, with each base pair having the same constant rate of randomly flipping to any other. So, we get a Markov process on the set</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X+%3D+%5C%7B%5Ctextrm%7BA%2CT%2CC%2CG%7D%5C%7D%7B%7D%5EN+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X = &#92;{&#92;textrm{A,T,C,G}&#92;}{}^N " class="latex" /></p>
<p>However, a species can also split in two. So, given current-day genetic data from various species, biologists try to infer the most probable tree where, starting from a common ancestor, the DNA in question undergoes a random walk most of the time but branches in two at certain times.</p>
<p>To formalize this, we can define a concept of &#8216;phylogenetic tree&#8217;. Our work is based on the definition of <a href="http://finmath.stanford.edu/~susan/papers/lap.pdf">Billera, Holmes and Vogtmann</a>, though we use a slightly different definition, for reasons that will soon become clear. For us, a phylogenetic tree is a rooted tree with leaves labelled by numbers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2C2%2C+%5Cdots%2C+n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="1,2, &#92;dots, n" class="latex" /> and edges labelled by &#8216;times&#8217; or, geometrically speaking, &#8216;lengths&#8217; in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5B0%2C+%5Cinfty%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="[0, &#92;infty)." class="latex" /> We require that:</p>
<p>• the length of every edge is positive, except perhaps for &#8216;external edges&#8217;: that is, edges incident to the leaves or root;</p>
<p>• there are no 1-ary vertices.</p>
<p>For example, here is a phylogenetic tree with 5 leaves:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ecological/phylo/phylogenetic_tree.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cell_1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+%5Cell_6+%5Cge+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;ell_1, &#92;dots, &#92;ell_6 &#92;ge 0" class="latex" /> but we demand that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cell_7+%3E+0.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;ell_7 &gt; 0." class="latex" /> We draw the vertices as dots. We do not count the leaves and the root as vertices, and we label the root with the number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="0." class="latex" /> We cannot collapse edges of length zero that end at leaves, since doing so would eliminate those leaves. Also note that the embedding of the tree in the plane is irrelevant, so this counts as the same phylogenetic tree:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ecological/phylo/phylogenetic_tree_2.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p>In applications to biology, we are often interested in trees where the total distance from the root to the leaf is the same for every leaf, since all species have evolved for the same time from their common ancestor. These are mathematically interesting as well, because then the distance between any two leaves defines an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrametric_space">ultrametric</a> on the set of leaves. However, more general phylogenetic trees are also interesting—and they become essential when we construct an operad whose operations are phylogenetic trees.</p>
<p>Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BPhyl%7D_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Phyl}_n" class="latex" /> be the set of phylogenetic trees with <i>n</i> leaves. This has a natural topology, which we explain in Section 6 of our paper. For example, here is a continuous path in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BPhyl%7D_4&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Phyl}_4" class="latex" /> where we only change the length of one internal edge, reducing it until it becomes zero and we can collapse it:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ecological/phylo/path_of_phylogenetic_trees.jpg" alt="" width="450" /></div>
<p>Phylogenetic trees reconstructed by biologists are typically binary. When a phylogenetic tree appears to have higher arity, sometimes we merely lack sufficient data to resolve a higher-arity branching into a number of binary ones. With the topology we are using on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BPhyl%7D_n%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Phyl}_n," class="latex" /> binary trees form an open dense set of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BPhyl%7D_n%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Phyl}_n," class="latex" /> except for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BPhyl%7D_1.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Phyl}_1." class="latex" /> However, trees of higher arity are still important, because paths, paths of paths, etc. in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BPhyl%7D_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Phyl}_n" class="latex" /> are often forced to pass through trees of higher arity.</p>
<p>Billera, Holmes and Vogtmann focused their attention on the set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BT%7D_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathcal{T}_n" class="latex" /> of phylogenetic trees where lengths of the external edges&#8212;edges incident to the root and leaves&#8212;are fixed to a constant value. They endow <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BT%7D_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathcal{T}_n" class="latex" /> with a metric, which induces a topology on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BT%7D_n%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathcal{T}_n," class="latex" /> and there is a homeomorphism</p>

<p>In algebraic topology, trees are often used to describe the composition of <i>n</i>-ary operations. This is formalized in the theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operad_theory">operads</a>. An &#8216;operad&#8217; is an algebraic stucture where for each natural number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D0%2C1%2C2%2C%5Cdots&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n=0,1,2,&#92;dots" class="latex" /> we have a set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O_n" class="latex" /> whose elements are considered as abstract <i>n</i>-ary operations, not necessarily operating on anything yet. An element <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f+%5Cin+O_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f &#92;in O_n" class="latex" /> can be depicted as a planar tree with one vertex and <i>n</i> labelled leaves:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ecological/phylo/corolla.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p>We can compose these operations in a tree-like way to get new operations:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ecological/phylo/operad_composition.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p>and an associative law holds, making this sort of composite unambiguous:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ecological/phylo/operad_associativity.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p>There are various kinds of operads, but in this paper our operads will always be &#8216;unital&#8217;, having an operation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1+%5Cin+O_1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="1 &#92;in O_1" class="latex" /> that acts as an identity for composition. They will also be &#8216;symmetric&#8217;, meaning there is an action of the symmetric group <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S_n" class="latex" /> on each set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O_n%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O_n," class="latex" /> compatible with composition. Further, they will be &#8216;topological&#8217;, meaning that each set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O_n" class="latex" /> is a topological space, with composition and permutations acting as continuous maps.</p>
<p>In Section 5 we prove that there is an operad <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BPhyl%7D%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Phyl}," class="latex" /> the &#8216;phylogenetic operad&#8217;, whose space of <i>n</i>-ary operations is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BPhyl%7D_n.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Phyl}_n." class="latex" /> This raises a number of questions:</p>
<p>• What is the mathematical nature of this operad?</p>
<p>• How is it related to &#8216;Markov processes with branching&#8217;?</p>
<p>• How is it related to known operads in topology?</p>
<p>Briefly, the answer is that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BPhyl%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Phyl}" class="latex" /> is the coproduct of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BCom%7D%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Com}," class="latex" /> the operad for commutative topological semigroups, and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5B0%2C%5Cinfty%29%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="[0,&#92;infty)," class="latex" /> the operad having only unary operations, one for each <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t+%5Cin+%5B0%2C%5Cinfty%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="t &#92;in [0,&#92;infty)." class="latex" /> The first describes branching, the second describes Markov processes. Moreover, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BPhyl%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Phyl}" class="latex" /> is closely related to the Boardmann&#8211;Vogt <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="W" class="latex" /> construction applied to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BCom%7D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Com}." class="latex" /> This is a construction that Boardmann and Vogt applied to another operad in order to obtain an operad whose algebras are loop spaces.</p>
<p>To understand all this in more detail, first recall that the <i>raison d&#8217;être</i> of operads is to have &#8216;algebras&#8217;. The most traditional sort of algebra of an operad <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O" class="latex" /> is a topological space <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> on which each operation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f+%5Cin+O_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f &#92;in O_n" class="latex" /> acts as a<br />
continuous map</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha%28f%29%5Ccolon+X%5En+%5Cto+X+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;alpha(f)&#92;colon X^n &#92;to X " class="latex" /></p>
<p>obeying some conditions: composition, the identity, and the permutation group actions are preserved, and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha%28f%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;alpha(f)" class="latex" /> depends continuously on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f." class="latex" /> The idea is that the abstract operations in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O" class="latex" /> are realized as actual operations on the space <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X." class="latex" /></p>
<p>In this paper we instead need algebras of a linear sort. Such an algebra of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O" class="latex" /> is a finite-dimensional real vector space <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="V" class="latex" /> on which each operation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f+%5Cin+O_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f &#92;in O_n" class="latex" /> acts as a multilinear map</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha%28f%29%5Ccolon+V%5En+%5Cto+X+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;alpha(f)&#92;colon V^n &#92;to X " class="latex" /></p>
<p>obeying the same list of conditions. We can also think of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha%28f%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;alpha(f)" class="latex" /> as a linear map</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha%28f%29%5Ccolon+V%5E%7B%5Cotimes+n%7D+%5Cto+V+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;alpha(f)&#92;colon V^{&#92;otimes n} &#92;to V " class="latex" /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V%5E%7B%5Cotimes+n%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="V^{&#92;otimes n}" class="latex" /> is the <i>n</i>th tensor power of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="V." class="latex" /></p>
<p>We also need &#8216;coalgebras&#8217; of operads. The point is that while ordinarily one thinks of an operation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f+%5Cin+O_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f &#92;in O_n" class="latex" /> as having <i>n</i> inputs and one output, a phylogenetic tree is better thought of as having one input and <i>n</i> outputs. A coalgebra of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O" class="latex" /> is a finite-dimensional real vector space <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="V" class="latex" /> on which operation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f+%5Cin+O_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f &#92;in O_n" class="latex" /> gives a linear map</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha%28f%29+%5Ccolon+V+%5Cto+V%5E%7B%5Cotimes+n%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;alpha(f) &#92;colon V &#92;to V^{&#92;otimes n} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>obeying the same conditions as an algebra, but &#8216;turned around&#8217;.</p>
<p>The main point of this paper is that the phylogenetic operad has interesting coalgebras, which correspond to how phylogenetic trees are actually used to describe branching Markov processes in biology. But to understand this, we need to start by looking at coalgebras of two operads from which the phylogenetic operad is built.</p>
<p>By abuse of notation, we will use <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5B0%2C%5Cinfty%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="[0,&#92;infty)" class="latex" /> as the name for the operad having only unary operations, one for each <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t+%5Cin+%5B0%2C%5Cinfty%29%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="t &#92;in [0,&#92;infty)," class="latex" /> with composition of operations given by addition.

<p>This handles the Markov process aspect of DNA evolution; what about the branching? For this we use <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BCom%7D%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Com}," class="latex" /> the unique operad with one <i>n</i>-ary operation for each <i>n</i> &gt; 0. Algebras of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BCom%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Com}" class="latex" /> are not-necessarily-unital commutative algebras: there is only one way to multiply <i>n</i> elements for <i>n</i> &gt; 0.</p>
<p>For us what matters most is that coalgebras of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BCom%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Com}" class="latex" /> are finite-dimensional cocommutative coalgebras, not necessarily with counit.

<p>Next, we wish to describe how to combine the operads <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5B0%2C%5Cinfty%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="[0,&#92;infty)" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BCom%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Com}" class="latex" /> to obtain the phylogenetic operad. Any pair of operads <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%27&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O&#039;" class="latex" /> has a coproduct <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O+%2B+O%27.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O + O&#039;." class="latex" /> The definition of coproduct gives an easy way to understand the algebras of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O+%2B+O%27.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O + O&#039;." class="latex" /> Such an algebra is simply an object that is both an algebra of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O" class="latex" /> and an algebra of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%27%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O&#039;," class="latex" /> with no compatibility conditions imposed.</p>
<p>One can also give an explicit construction of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O+%2B+O%27.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O + O&#039;." class="latex" /> Briefly, the <i>n</i>-ary operations of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O+%2B+O%27&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O + O&#039;" class="latex" /> are certain equivalence classes of trees with leaves labelled <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B1%2C%5Cdots%2C+n%5C%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;{1,&#92;dots, n&#92;}" class="latex" /> and all nodes, except for leaves, labelled by operations in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O" class="latex" /> or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%27.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O&#039;." class="latex" /> While this fact is surely known to experts on operads, it seems hard to find in the literature, so we prove this in Theorem 24.</p>
<p>Given this, it should come as no surprise that the operad <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BPhyl%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Phyl}" class="latex" /> is the coproduct <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BCom%7D+%2B+%5B0%2C%5Cinfty%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Com} + [0,&#92;infty)." class="latex" /> In fact, we shall take this as a definition. Starting from this definition, we work backwards to show that the operations of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BPhyl%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Phyl}" class="latex" /> correspond to phylogenetic trees. We prove this in Theorem 28. The definition of coproduct determines a topology on the spaces <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BPhyl%7D_n%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Phyl}_n," class="latex" /> and it is a nontrivial fact that with this topology we have <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BPhyl%7D_n+%5Ccong+%5Cmathcal%7BT%7D_n+%5Ctimes+%5B0%2C%5Cinfty%29%5E%7Bn%2B1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Phyl}_n &#92;cong &#92;mathcal{T}_n &#92;times [0,&#92;infty)^{n+1}" class="latex" /> for <i>n</i> &gt; 1, where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BT%7D_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathcal{T}_n" class="latex" /> has the topology defined by Billera, Holmes and Vogtmann. We prove this in Theorem 34.</p>
<p>Using the definition of the phylogenetic operad as a coproduct, it is clear that given any Markov process on a finite set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X," class="latex" /> the vector space <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5EX&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}^X" class="latex" /> naturally becomes a coalgebra of this operad. The reason is that, as we have seen, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5EX&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}^X" class="latex" /> is automatically a coalgebra of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BCom%7D%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Com}," class="latex" /> and the Markov process makes it into a coalgebra of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5B0%2C%5Cinfty%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="[0,&#92;infty)." class="latex" /> Thus, by the universal property of a coproduct, it becomes a coalgebra of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BPhyl%7D+%5Ccong+%5Ctextrm%7BCom%7D+%2B+%5B0%2C%5Cinfty%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Phyl} &#92;cong &#92;textrm{Com} + [0,&#92;infty)." class="latex" /> We prove this in Theorem 36.</p>
<p>Since operads arose in algebraic topology, it is interesting to consider how the phylogenetic operad connects to ideas from that subject. Boardmann and Vogt defined a construction on operads, the &#8216;<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="W" class="latex" /> construction&#8217;, which when applied to the operad for spaces with an associative multiplication gives an operad for loop spaces. The operad <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BPhyl%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Phyl}" class="latex" /> has an interesting relation to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W%28%5Ctextrm%7BCom%7D%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="W(&#92;textrm{Com})." class="latex" /> To see this, define addition on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5B0%2C%5Cinfty%5D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="[0,&#92;infty]" class="latex" /> in the obvious way, where</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cinfty+%2B+t+%3D+t+%2B+%5Cinfty+%3D+%5Cinfty+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;infty + t = t + &#92;infty = &#92;infty " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5B0%2C%5Cinfty%5D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="[0,&#92;infty]" class="latex" /> becomes a commutative topological monoid, so we obtain an operad with only unary operations, one for each <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t+%5Cin+%5B0%2C%5Cinfty%5D%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="t &#92;in [0,&#92;infty]," class="latex" /> where composition is addition. By abuse of notation, let us call this operad <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5B0%2C%5Cinfty%5D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="[0,&#92;infty]." class="latex" /></p>
<p>Boardmann and Vogt&#8217;s <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="W" class="latex" /> construction involves trees with edges having lengths in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5B0%2C1%5D%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="[0,1]," class="latex" /> but we can equivalently use <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5B0%2C%5Cinfty%5D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="[0,&#92;infty]." class="latex" /> <a href="http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~tl/w.pdf">Leinster</a> has observed that for any <i>nonsymmetric</i> topological operad <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O," class="latex" /> Boardmann and Vogt&#8217;s operad <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W%28O%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="W(O)" class="latex" /> is closely related to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O+%2B+%5B0%2C%5Cinfty%5D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O + [0,&#92;infty]." class="latex" /> Here we make this observation precise in the symmetric case.

<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0502155">Berger and Moerdijk</a> showed that if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S_n" class="latex" /> acts freely on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O_n" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O_1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O_1" class="latex" /> is well-pointed, then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W%28O%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="W(O)" class="latex" /> is a cofibrant replacement for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O." class="latex" /> This is true for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O+%3D+%5Ctextrm%7BAssoc%7D%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O = &#92;textrm{Assoc}," class="latex" /> the operad whose algebras are topological semigroups.

<p>Nonetheless, the larger operad <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BCom%7D+%2B+%5B0%2C%5Cinfty%5D%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Com} + [0,&#92;infty]," class="latex" /> a compactification of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BPhyl%7D+%3D+%5Ctextrm%7BCom%7D+%2B+%5B0%2C%5Cinfty%29%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Phyl} = &#92;textrm{Com} + [0,&#92;infty)," class="latex" /> is somewhat interesting. The reason is that any Markov process</p>

<p>approaches a limit as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t+%5Cto+%5Cinfty.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="t &#92;to &#92;infty." class="latex" /> Indeed, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;alpha" class="latex" /> extends uniquely to a homomorphism from the topological monoid <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5B0%2C%5Cinfty%5D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="[0,&#92;infty] " class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BEnd%7D%28%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5EX%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{End}(&#92;mathbb{R}^X)." class="latex" /> Thus, given a Markov process on a finite set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X," class="latex" /> the vector space <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5EX&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}^X" class="latex" /> naturally becomes a coalgebra of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BCom%7D+%2B+%5B0%2C%5Cinfty%5D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Com} + [0,&#92;infty]." class="latex" /> We prove this in Theorem 38.</p>

					<p>Here&#8217;s a paper for the proceedings of a workshop on <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/nimbios/">Information and Entropy in Biological System</a> this spring:</p>
<p>• John Baez and Blake Pollard, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02742">Relative entropy in biological systems</a>, with Blake S. Pollard, <i><a href="http://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/18/2/46">Entropy</a></i> <b>18</b> (2016), 46.</p>
<p>We&#8217;d love any comments or questions you might have. I&#8217;m not happy with the title. In the paper we advocate using the term &#8216;relative information&#8217; instead of &#8216;relative entropy&#8217;&#8212;yet the latter is much more widely used, so I feel we need it in the title to let people know what the paper is about!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the basic idea.</p>
<p>Life relies on nonequilibrium thermodynamics, since in thermal equilibrium there are no flows of free energy. Biological systems are also open systems, in the sense that both matter and energy flow in and out of them. Nonetheless, it is important in biology that systems can sometimes be treated as approximately closed, and sometimes approach equilibrium before being disrupted in one way or another. This can occur on a wide range of scales, from large ecosystems to within a single cell or organelle. Examples include:</p>
<p>• A population approaching an evolutionarily stable state.</p>
<p>• Random processes such as mutation, genetic drift, the diffusion of organisms in an environment or the diffusion of molecules in a liquid.</p>
<p>• A chemical reaction approaching equilibrium.</p>
<p>An interesting common feature of these processes is that as they occur, quantities mathematically akin to entropy tend to increase. Closely related quantities such as free energy tend to decrease. In this review, we explain some mathematical results that make this idea precise.</p>
<p>Most of these results involve a quantity that is variously known as &#8216;relative information&#8217;, &#8216;relative entropy&#8217;, &#8216;information gain&#8217; or the &#8216;Kullback&#8211;Leibler divergence&#8217;. We&#8217;ll use the first term. Given two probability distributions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="q" class="latex" /> on a finite set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" />, their <b>relative information</b>, or more precisely the <b>information of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p" class="latex" /> relative to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="q" class="latex" /></b>, is</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+I%28p%5C%7Cq%29+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bi+%5Cin+X%7D+p_i+%5Cln%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7Bp_i%7D%7Bq_i%7D%5Cright%29+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ I(p&#92;|q) = &#92;sum_{i &#92;in X} p_i &#92;ln&#92;left(&#92;frac{p_i}{q_i}&#92;right) } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>We use the word &#8216;information&#8217; instead of &#8216;entropy&#8217; because one expects entropy to increase with time, and the theorems we present will say that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I%28p%5C%7Cq%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="I(p&#92;|q)" class="latex" /> decreases with time under various conditions. The reason is that the Shannon entropy</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+S%28p%29+%3D+-%5Csum_%7Bi+%5Cin+X%7D+p_i+%5Cln+p_i+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ S(p) = -&#92;sum_{i &#92;in X} p_i &#92;ln p_i } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>contains a minus sign that is missing from the definition of relative information.</p>
<p>Intuitively, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I%28p%5C%7Cq%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="I(p&#92;|q)" class="latex" /> is the amount of information gained when we start with a hypothesis given by some probability distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="q" class="latex" /> and then learn the &#8216;true&#8217; probability distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p" class="latex" />. For example, if we start with the hypothesis that a coin is fair and then are told that it landed heads up, the relative information is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cln+2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;ln 2" class="latex" />, so we have gained 1 bit of information. If however we started with the hypothesis that the coin always lands heads up, we would have gained no information.</p>
<p>We put the word &#8216;true&#8217; in quotes here, because the notion of a &#8216;true&#8217; probability distribution, which subjective Bayesians reject, is not required to use relative information. A more cautious description of relative information is that it is a <b>divergence</b>: a way of measuring the difference between probability distributions that obeys</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I%28p+%5C%7C+q%29+%5Cge+0+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="I(p &#92;| q) &#92;ge 0 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I%28p+%5C%7C+q%29+%3D+0+%5Ciff+p+%3D+q+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="I(p &#92;| q) = 0 &#92;iff p = q " class="latex" /></p>
<p>but not necessarily the other axioms for a distance function, symmetry and the triangle inequality, which indeed fail for relative information.</p>
<p>There are many other divergences besides relative information, some of which we discuss in Section 6. However, relative information can be singled out by a number of characterizations, including <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2014/02/16/relative-entropy-part-4/">one based on ideas from Bayesian inference</a>. The relative information is also close to the expected number of extra bits required to code messages distributed according to the probability measure <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p" class="latex" /> using a code optimized for messages distributed according to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="q" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>In this review, we describe various ways in which a population or probability distribution evolves continuously according to some differential equation. For all these differential equations, I describe conditions under which relative information decreases. Briefly, the results are as follows. We hasten to reassure the reader that our paper explains all the jargon involved, and the proofs of the claims are given in full:</p>
<p>• In Section 2, we consider a very general form of the Lotka&#8211;Volterra equations, which are a commonly used model of population dynamics. Starting from the population <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="P_i" class="latex" /> of each type of replicating entity, we can define a probability distribution</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_i+%3D+%5Cdisplaystyle%7B%5Cfrac%7BP_i%7D%7B%5Csum_%7Bi+%5Cin+X%7D+P_i+%7D%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p_i = &#92;displaystyle{&#92;frac{P_i}{&#92;sum_{i &#92;in X} P_i }} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>which evolves according to a nonlinear equation called the replicator equation. We describe a necessary and sufficient condition under which <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I%28q%5C%7Cp%28t%29%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="I(q&#92;|p(t))" class="latex" /> is nonincreasing when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%28t%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p(t)" class="latex" /> evolves according to the replicator equation while <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="q" class="latex" /> is held fixed.</p>
<p>• In Section 3, we consider a special case of the replicator equation that is widely studied in evolutionary game theory. In this case we can think of probability distributions as mixed strategies in a two-player game. When <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="q" class="latex" /> is a dominant strategy, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I%28q%5C%7Cp%28t%29%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="I(q&#92;|p(t))" class="latex" /> can never increase when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%28t%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p(t)" class="latex" /> evolves according to the replicator equation. We can think of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I%28q%5C%7Cp%28t%29%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="I(q&#92;|p(t))" class="latex" /> as the information that the population has left to learn. Thus, evolution is analogous to a learning process&#8212;an analogy that in the field of artificial intelligence is exploited by evolutionary algorithms!</p>
<p>• In Section 4 we consider continuous-time, finite-state Markov processes. Here we have probability distributions on a finite set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> evolving according to a linear equation called the master equation. In this case <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I%28p%28t%29%5C%7Cq%28t%29%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="I(p(t)&#92;|q(t))" class="latex" /> can never increase. Thus, if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="q" class="latex" /> is a steady state solution of the master equation, both <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I%28p%28t%29%5C%7Cq%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="I(p(t)&#92;|q)" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I%28q%5C%7Cp%28t%29%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="I(q&#92;|p(t))" class="latex" /> are nonincreasing. We can always write <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="q" class="latex" /> as the Boltzmann distribution for some energy function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E+%3A+X+%5Cto+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="E : X &#92;to &#92;mathbb{R}" class="latex" />, meaning that</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+q_i+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cexp%28-E_i+%2F+k+T%29%7D%7B%5Cdisplaystyle%7B%5Csum_%7Bj+%5Cin+X%7D+%5Cexp%28-E_j+%2F+k+T%29%7D%7D+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ q_i = &#92;frac{&#92;exp(-E_i / k T)}{&#92;displaystyle{&#92;sum_{j &#92;in X} &#92;exp(-E_j / k T)}} } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T" class="latex" /> is temperature and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" /> is Boltzmann&#8217;s constant. In this case, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I%28p%28t%29%5C%7Cq%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="I(p(t)&#92;|q)" class="latex" /> is proportional to a difference of free energies:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+I%28p%28t%29%5C%7Cq%29+%3D+%5Cfrac%7BF%28p%29+-+F%28q%29%7D%7BT%7D+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ I(p(t)&#92;|q) = &#92;frac{F(p) - F(q)}{T} } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Thus, the nonincreasing nature of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I%28p%28t%29%5C%7Cq%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="I(p(t)&#92;|q)" class="latex" /> is a version of the Second Law of Thermodynamics.</p>
<p>• In Section 5, we consider chemical reactions and other processes described by reaction networks. In this context we have populations <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="P_i" class="latex" /> of entities of various kinds <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i+%5Cin+X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i &#92;in X" class="latex" />, and these populations evolve according to a nonlinear equation called the rate equation.

				<div class="entry">
					<p>The Institute for Mathematics and its Applications (or <a href="http://www.ima.umn.edu">IMA</a>, in Minneapolis, Minnesota), is teaming up with the Mathematical Biosciences Institute (or <a href="http://mbi.osu.edu/about/">MBI</a>, in Columbus, Ohio).  They&#8217;re having a big program on control theory and networks:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://mbi.osu.edu/programs/emphasis-programs/spring-2016-dynamics-biologically-inspired-networks">IMA-MBI coordinated program on network dynamics and control: Fall 2015 and Spring 2016</a>.</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://mbi.osu.edu/programs/emphasis-programs/spring-2016-dynamics-biologically-inspired-networks/">MBI emphasis semester on dynamics of biologically inspired networks: Spring 2016</a>.</p>
<h3> At the IMA </h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s happening at the Institute for Mathematics and its Applications:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Concepts and techniques from control theory are becoming increasingly interdisciplinary. At the same time, trends in modern control theory are influenced and inspired by other disciplines. As a result, the systems and control community is rapidly broadening its scope in a variety of directions. The IMA program is designed to encourage true interdisciplinary research and the cross fertilization of ideas. An important element for success is that ideas flow across disciplines in a timely manner and that the cross-fertilization takes place in unison.</p>
<p>Due to the usefulness of control, talent from control theory is drawn and often migrates to other important areas, such as biology, computer science, and biomedical research, to apply its mathematical tools and expertise. It is vital that while the links are strong, we bring together researchers who have successfully bridged into other disciplines to promote the role of control theory and to focus on the efforts of the controls community. An IMA investment in this area will be a catalyst for many advances and will provide the controls community with a cohesive research agenda.</p>
<p>In all topics of the program the need for research is pressing. For instance, viable implementations of control algorithms for smart grids are an urgent and clearly recognized need with considerable implications for the environment and quality of life. The mathematics of control will undoubtedly influence technology and vice-versa. The urgency for these new technologies suggests that the greatest impact of the program is to have it sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>First trimester (Fall 2015): Networks, whether social, biological, swarms of animals or vehicles, the Internet, etc., constitute an increasingly important subject in science and engineering. Their connectivity and feedback pathways affect robustness and functionality. Such concepts are at the core of a new and rapidly evolving frontier in the theory of dynamical systems and control. Embedded systems and networks are already pervasive in automotive, biological, aerospace, and telecommunications technologies and soon are expected to impact the power infrastructure (smart grids). In this new technological and scientific realm, the modeling and representation of systems, the role of feedback, and the value and cost of information need to be re-evaluated and understood. Traditional thinking that is relevant to a limited number of feedback loops with practically unlimited bandwidth is no longer applicable. Feedback control and stability of network dynamics is a relatively new endeavor. Analysis and control of network dynamics will occupy mostly the first trimester while applications to power networks will be a separate theme during the third trimester. The first trimester will be divided into three workshops on the topics of analysis of network dynamics and regulation, communication and cooperative control over networks, and a separate one on biological systems and networks.</p>
<p>The second trimester (Winter 2016) will have two workshops. The first will be on modeling and estimation (Workshop 4) and the second one on distributed parameter systems and partial differential equations (Workshop 5). The theme of Workshop 4 will be on structure and parsimony in models. The goal is to explore recent relevant theories and techniques that allow sparse representations, rank constrained optimization, and structural constraints in models and control designs. Our intent is to blend a group of researchers in the aforementioned topics with a select group of researchers with interests in a statistical viewpoint. Workshop 5 will focus on distributed systems and related computational issues. One of our aims is to bring control theorists with an interest in optimal control of distributed parameter systems together with mathematicians working on optimal transport theory (in essence an optimal control problem). The subject of optimal transport is rapidly developing with ramifications in probability and statistics (of essence in system modeling and hence of interest to participants in Workshop 4 as well) and in distributed control of PDE&#8217;s. Emphasis will also be placed on new tools and new mathematical developments (in PDE&#8217;s, computational methods, optimization). The workshops will be closely spaced to facilitate participation in more than one.</p>
<p>The third trimester (Spring 2016) will target applications where the mathematics of systems and control may soon prove to have a timely impact. From the invention of atomic force microscopy at the nanoscale to micro-mirror arrays for a next generation of telescopes, control has played a critical role in sensing and imaging of challenging new realms. At present, thanks to recent technological advances of AFM and optical tweezers, great strides are taking place making it possible to manipulate the biological transport of protein molecules as well as the control of individual atoms. Two intertwined subject areas, quantum and nano control and scientific instrumentation, are seen to blend together (Workshop 6) with partial focus on the role of feedback control and optimal filtering in achieving resolution and performance at such scales. A second theme (Workshop 7) will aim at control issues in distributed hybrid systems, at a macro scale, with a specific focus the “smart grid&#8221; and energy applications.

<h3> At the MBI </h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s going on at the Mathematical Biology Institute:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The MBI network program is part of a yearlong cooperative program with IMA.  </p>
<p>Networks and deterministic and stochastic dynamical systems on networks are used as models in many areas of biology. This underscores the importance of developing tools to understand the interplay between network structures and dynamical processes, as well as how network dynamics can be controlled. The dynamics associated with such models are often different from what one might traditionally expect from a large system of equations, and these differences present the opportunity to develop exciting new theories and methods that should facilitate the analysis of specific models. Moreover, a nascent area of research is the dynamics of networks in which the networks themselves change in time, which occurs, for example, in plasticity in neuroscience and in up regulation and down regulation of enzymes in biochemical systems.</p>
<p>There are many areas in biology (including neuroscience, gene networks, and epidemiology) in which network analysis is now standard. Techniques from network science have yielded many biological insights in these fields and their study has yielded many theorems. Moreover, these areas continue to be exciting areas that contain both concrete and general mathematical problems. Workshop 1 explores the mathematics behind the applications in which restrictions on general coupled systems are important. Examples of such restrictions include symmetry, Boolean dynamics, and mass-action kinetics; and each of these special properties permits the proof of theorems about dynamics on these special networks.</p>
<p>Workshop 2 focuses on the interplay between stochastic and deterministic behavior in biological networks. An important related problem is to understand how stochasticity affects parameter estimation. Analyzing the relationship between stochastic changes, network structure, and network dynamics poses mathematical questions that are new, difficult, and fascinating.</p>
<p>In recent years, an increasing number of biological systems have been modeled using networks whose structure changes in time or which use multiple kinds of couplings between the same nodes or couplings that are not just pairwise. General theories such as groupoids and hypergraphs have been developed to handle the structure in some of these more general coupled systems, and specific application models have been studied by simulation. Workshop 3 will bring together theorists, modelers, and experimentalists to address the modeling of biological systems using new network structures and the analysis of such structures.</p>
<p>Biological systems use control to achieve desired dynamics and prevent undesirable behaviors. Consequently, the study of network control is important both to reveal naturally evolved control mechanisms that underlie the functioning of biological systems and to develop human-designed control interventions to recover lost function, mitigate failures, or repurpose biological networks. Workshop 4 will address the challenging subjects of control and observability of network dynamics.</p>

					<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morpho_peleides"><br />
<img src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ecological/morpho_peleides.jpg" alt="" width="450" /><br />
</a></p>
<p>Some butterflies have shiny, vividly colored wings. From different angles you see different colors. This effect is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridescence">iridescence</a>. How does it work?</p>
<p>It turns out these butterfly wings are made of very fancy materials! Light bounces around inside these materials in a tricky way. Sunlight of different colors winds up reflecting off these materials in different directions.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re starting to understand the materials and make similar substances in the lab. They&#8217;re called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photonic_crystal">photonic crystals</a>. They have amazing properties.</p>
<p>Here at the <a href="http://www.quantumlah.org/">Centre for Quantum Technologies</a> we have people studying exotic materials of many kinds. Next door, there&#8217;s a lab completely devoted to studying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphene">graphene</a>: crystal sheets of carbon in which electrons can move as if they were massless particles! Graphene has a lot of potential for building new technologies&#8212;that&#8217;s why Singapore is pumping money into researching it.</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/graphene.jpg" alt="" width="450" /></div>
<p><a href="http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2015/Weyl-points-detected-0716">Some physicists at MIT</a> just showed that one of the materials in butterfly wings might act like a 3d form of graphene. In graphene, electrons can only move easily in 2 directions. In this new material, electrons could move in all 3 directions, acting as if they had no mass.</p>
<p>The pictures here show the microscopic structure of two materials found in butterfly wings:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/gyroid_versus_double_gyroid.jpg" alt="" width="450" /></div>
<p>The picture at left actually shows a sculpture made by the mathematical artist <a href="https://www.bathsheba.com/math/gyroid/">Bathsheba Grossman</a>. But it&#8217;s a piece of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyroid">gyroid</a>: a surface with a very complicated shape, which repeats forever in 3 directions. It&#8217;s called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_surface">minimal surface</a> because you can&#8217;t shrink its area by tweaking it just a little. It divides space into two regions.</p>
<p>The gyroid was discovered in 1970 by a mathematician, Alan Schoen. It&#8217;s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triply_periodic_minimal_surface">triply periodic minimal surfaces</a>, meaning one that repeats itself in 3 different directions in space, like a crystal.</p>
<div align="center"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyroid"><br />
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/gyroid.gif" alt="" /></a></div>
<p>Schoen was working for NASA, and his idea was to use the gyroid for building ultra-light, super-strong structures. But that didn&#8217;t happen. Research doesn&#8217;t move in predictable directions.</p>
<p>In 1983, people discovered that in some mixtures of oil and water, the oil naturally forms a gyroid. The sheets of oil try to minimize their area, so it&#8217;s not surprising that they form a minimal surface. Something else makes this surface be a gyroid&#8212;I&#8217;m not sure what.</p>
<p>Butterfly wings are made of a hard material called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chitin">chitin</a>. Around 2008, people discovered that the chitin in some iridescent butterfly wings is made in a gyroid pattern! The spacing in this pattern is very small, about one wavelength of visible light. This makes light move through this material in a complicated way, which depends on the light&#8217;s color and the direction it&#8217;s moving.</p>
<p>So: <i>butterflies have naturally evolved a photonic crystal based on a gyroid!</i></p>
<p>The universe is awesome, but it&#8217;s not magic. A mathematical pattern is beautiful if it&#8217;s a simple solution to at least one simple problem. This is why beautiful patterns naturally bring themselves into existence: they&#8217;re the simplest ways for certain things to happen. Darwinian evolution helps out: it scans through trillions of possibilities and finds solutions to problems. So, we should <i>expect</i> life to be packed with mathematically beautiful patterns&#8230; and it is.</p>
<p>The picture at right above shows a &#8216;double gyroid&#8217;. Here it is again:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/double_gyroid.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p>This is actually two interlocking surfaces, shown in red and blue.  You can get them by writing the gyroid as a level surface:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%2Cy%2Cz%29+%3D+0+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f(x,y,z) = 0 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>and taking the two nearby surfaces</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%2Cy%2Cz%29+%3D+%5Cpm+c+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f(x,y,z) = &#92;pm c " class="latex" /></p>
<p>for some small value of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c." class="latex" />.</p>
<p>It turns out that while they&#8217;re still growing, some butterflies have a double gyroid pattern in their wings. This turns into a single gyroid when they grow up!</p>
<p>The new research at MIT studied how an electron would move through a double gyroid pattern. They calculated its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersion_relation">dispersion relation</a>: how the speed of the electron would depend on its energy and the direction it&#8217;s moving.</p>
<p>An ordinary particle moves faster if it has more energy. But a massless particle, like a photon, moves at the same speed no matter what energy it has. The MIT team showed that an electron in a double gyroid pattern moves at a speed that doesn&#8217;t depend much on its energy. So, in some ways this electron acts like a massless particle.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s quite different than a photon. It&#8217;s actually more like a neutrino! You see, unlike photons, electrons and neutrinos are spin-1/2 particles.  Neutrinos are almost massless.  A massless spin-1/2 particle can have a built-in handedness, spinning in only one direction around its axis of motion. Such a particle is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weyl_equation">Weyl spinor</a>. The MIT team showed that a electron moving through a double gyroid acts approximately like a Weyl spinor!</p>
<p>How does this work?  Well, the key fact is that the double gyroid has a built-in handedness, or chirality.  It comes in a left-handed and right-handed form.  You can see the handedness quite clearly in Grossman&#8217;s sculpture of the ordinary gyroid:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="https://www.bathsheba.com/math/gyroid/"><img width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/gyroid_hex.jpg" alt="" /></a></div>
<p>Beware: nobody has actually made electrons act like Weyl spinors in the lab yet. The MIT team just found a way that should work.  Someday someone will actually make it happen, probably in less than a decade. And later, someone will do amazing things with this ability. I don&#8217;t know what. Maybe the butterflies know!</p>

<p>The paper by Michielsen and Stavenga is free online!  They say the famous &#8216;blue Morpho&#8217; butterfly shown in the picture at the top of this article does <i>not</i> use a gyroid; it uses a &#8220;two-dimensional photonic crystal slab consisting of arrays of rectangles formed by lamellae and microribs.&#8221;  But they find gyroids in four other species: <i>Callophrys rubi</i>, <i>Cyanophrys remus</i>, <i>Pardes sesostris</i> and <i>Teinopalpus imperialis</i>. It compares tunnelling electron microscope pictures of slices of their iridescent patches with computer-generated slices of gyroids. The comparison looks pretty good to me:</p>

<p>Again, the first is free online. There&#8217;s a lot of great math lurking inside, most of which is too mind-blowing too explain quickly. Let me just paraphrase the start of the paper, so at least experts can get the idea:</p>
<blockquote><p>Two-dimensional (2d) electrons and photons at the energies and frequencies of Dirac points exhibit extraordinary features. As the best example, almost all the remarkable properties of graphene are tied to the massless Dirac fermions at its Fermi level. Topologically, Dirac cones are not only the critical points for 2d phase transitions but also the unique surface manifestation of a topologically gapped 3d bulk. In a similar way, it is expected that if a material could be found that exhibits a 3d linear dispersion relation, it would also display a wide range of interesting physics phenomena. The associated 3D linear point degeneracies are called “Weyl points”. In the past year, there have been a few studies of Weyl fermions in electronics. The associated Fermi-arc surface states, quantum Hall effect, novel transport properties and a realization of the Adler&#8211;Bell&#8211;Jackiw anomaly are also expected. However, no observation of Weyl points has been reported. Here, we present a theoretical discovery and detailed numerical investigation of frequency-isolated Weyl points in perturbed double-gyroid photonic crystals along with their complete phase diagrams and their topologically protected surface states.</p></blockquote>
<p>Also a bit for the mathematicians:</p>
<blockquote><p>Weyl points are topologically stable objects in the 3d Brillouin zone: they act as monopoles of Berry flux in momentum space, and hence are intimately related to the topological invariant known as the Chern number. The Chern number can be defined for a single bulk band or a set of bands, where the Chern numbers of the individual bands are summed, on any closed 2d surface in the 3d Brillouin zone. The difference of the Chern numbers defined on two surfaces, of all bands below the Weyl point frequencies, equals the sum of the chiralities of the Weyl points enclosed in between the two surfaces.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a mix of topology and physics jargon that may be hard for pure mathematicians to understand, but I&#8217;ll be glad to translate if there&#8217;s interest.</p>
<p>For starters, a &#8216;monopole of Berry flux in momentum space&#8217; is a poetic way of talking about a twisted complex line bundle over the space of allowed energy-momenta of the electron in the double gyroid. We get a twist at every &#8216;Weyl point&#8217;, meaning a point where the dispersion relations look locally like those of a Weyl spinor when its energy-momentum is near zero. Near such a point, the dispersion relations are a Fourier-transformed version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weyl_equation">Weyl equation</a>.</p>

				<small>1 July, 2015</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>Here in Copenhagen we&#8217;ll soon be having a bunch of interesting talks on chemical reaction networks:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.math.ku.dk/~efeliu/trendsrnt/index.html">Workshop on Mathematical Trends in Reaction Network Theory</a>, 1-3 July 2015, Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of Copenhagen.  Organized by <a href="http://www.math.ku.dk/~efeliu/">Elisenda Feliu</a> and <a href="http://www.math.ku.dk/~pbx512/">Carsten Wiuf</a>.</p>
<p>Looking through the <a href="http://www.math.ku.dk/~efeliu/trendsrnt/abstracts.html">abstracts</a>, here are a couple that strike me.</p>
<p>First of all, Gheorghe Craciun claims to have proved the biggest open conjecture in this field: the Global Attractor Conjecture!</p>
<p>&bull; Gheorge Craciun, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.02860">Toric differential inclusions and a proof of the global attractor conjecture</a>.</p>
<p>This famous old conjecture says that for a certain class of chemical reactions, the ones coming from &#8216;complex balanced reaction networks&#8217;, the chemicals will approach equilibrium no matter what their initial concentrations are.  Here&#8217;s what Craciun says:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <strong>Abstract.</strong> In a groundbreaking 1972 paper Fritz Horn and Roy Jackson showed that a complex balanced mass-action system must have a unique locally stable equilibrium within any compatibility class. In 1974 Horn conjectured that this equilibrium is a global attractor, i.e., all solutions in the same compatibility class must converge to this equilibrium. Later, this claim was called the Global Attractor Conjecture, and it was shown that it has remarkable implications for the dynamics of large classes of polynomial and power-law dynamical systems, even if they are not derived from mass-action kinetics. Several special cases of this conjecture have been proved during the last decade. We describe a proof of the conjecture in full generality. In particular, it will follow that all detailed balanced mass action systems and all deficiency zero mass-action systems have the global attractor property. We will also discuss some implications for biochemical mechanisms that implement noise filtering and cellular homeostasis.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Manoj Gopalkrishnan wrote a <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2014/01/07/lyapunov-functions-for-complex-balanced-systems/">great post</a> explaining the concept of complex balanced reaction network here on Azimuth, so if you want to understand the conjecture you could start there.</p>
<p>Even better, Manoj is talking here about a way to do statistical inference with chemistry!  His talk is called &#8216;Statistical inference with a chemical soup&#8217;:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <b>Abstract.</b> The goal is to design an “intelligent chemical soup” that can do statistical inference. This may have niche technological applications in medicine and biological research, as well as provide fundamental insight into the workings of biochemical reaction pathways. As a first step towards our goal, we describe a scheme that exploits the remarkable mathematical similarity between log-linear models in statistics and chemical reaction networks. We present a simple scheme that encodes the information in a log-linear model as a chemical reaction network. Observed data is encoded as initial concentrations, and the equilibria of the corresponding mass-action system yield the maximum likelihood estimators. The simplicity of our scheme suggests that molecular environments, especially within cells, may be particularly well suited to performing statistical computations.
</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s based on this paper:</p>
<p>&bull; Manoj Gopalkrishnan, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03172">A scheme for molecular computation of maximum likelihood estimators for log-linear models</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure, but this idea may exploit existing analogies between the approach to equilibrium in chemistry, the approach to equilibrium in evolutionary game theory, and statistical inference.  You may have read <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2014/01/22/relative-entropy-in-evolutionary-dynamics/">Marc Harper&#8217;s post</a> about that stuff!</p>
<p>David Doty is giving a broader review of &#8216;Computation by (not about) chemistry&#8217;:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<b>Abstract.</b> The model of chemical reaction networks (CRNs) is extensively used throughout the natural sciences as a descriptive language for existing chemicals. If we instead think of CRNs as a programming language for describing artificially engineered chemicals, what sorts of computations are possible for these chemicals to achieve? The answer depends crucially on several formal choices:</p>
<p>1) Do we treat matter as infinitely divisible (real-valued concentrations) or atomic (integer-valued counts)?</p>
<p>2) How do we represent the input and output of the computation (e.g., Boolean presence or absence of species, positive numbers directly represented by counts/concentrations, positive and negative numbers represented indirectly by the difference between counts/concentrations of a pair of species)?</p>
<p>3) Do we assume mass-action rate laws (reaction rates proportional to reactant counts/concentrations) or do we insist the system works correctly under a broader class of rate laws? </p>
<p>The talk will survey several recent results and techniques. A primary goal of the talk is to convey the &#8220;programming perspective&#8221;: rather than asking &#8220;What does chemistry do?&#8221;, we want to understand &#8220;What could chemistry do?&#8221; as well as &#8220;What can chemistry provably not do?&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m really interested in chemical reaction networks that appear in biological systems, and there will be lots of talks about that.  For example, Ovidiu Radulescu will talk about &#8216;Taming the complexity of biochemical networks through model reduction and tropical geometry&#8217;.  Model reduction is the process of simplifying complicated models while preserving at least some of their good features.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_geometry">Tropical geometry</a> is a cool version of algebraic geometry that uses the real numbers with <em>minimization</em> as addition and <em>addition</em> as multiplication.  This number system underlies the principle of least action, or the principle of maximum energy.  Here is Radulescu&#8217;s abstract:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<b>Abstract.</b> Biochemical networks are used as models of cellular physiology with diverse applications in biology and medicine. In the absence of objective criteria to detect essential features and prune secondary details, networks generated from data are too big and therefore out of the applicability of many mathematical tools for studying their dynamics and behavior under perturbations. However, under circumstances that we can generically denote by multi-scaleness, large biochemical networks can be approximated by smaller and simpler networks. Model reduction is a way to find these simpler models that can be more easily analyzed. We discuss several model reduction methods for biochemical networks with polynomial or rational rate functions and propose as their common denominator the notion of tropical equilibration, meaning finite intersection of tropical varieties in algebraic geometry. Using tropical methods, one can strongly reduce the number of variables and parameters of biochemical network. For multi-scale networks, these reductions are computed symbolically on orders of magnitude of parameters and variables, and are valid in wide domains of parameter and phase spaces.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m talking about the analogy between probabilities and quantum amplitudes, and how this makes chemistry analogous to particle physics.  You can see two versions of my talk here, but I&#8217;ll be giving the &#8216;more advanced&#8217; version, which is new:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/prob/">Probabilities versus amplitudes</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <strong>Abstract.</strong> Some ideas from quantum theory are just beginning to percolate back to classical probability theory. For example, the master equation for a chemical reaction network describes the interactions of molecules in a stochastic rather than quantum way. If we look at it from the perspective of quantum theory, this formalism turns out to involve creation and annihilation operators, coherent states and other well-known ideas&#8212;but with a few big differences.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Anyway, there are a lot more talks, but if I don&#8217;t have breakfast and walk over to the math department, I&#8217;ll miss those talks!</p>
<p>You can learn more about individual talks in the comments here (see below) and also in Matteo Polettini&#8217;s blog:</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>In 1961, Rolf Landauer argued that that the least possible amount of energy required to erase one bit of information stored in memory at temperature <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T" class="latex" /> is  <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=kT+%5Cln+2%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="kT &#92;ln 2," class="latex" /> where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" /> is Boltzmann&#8217;s constant.</p>
<p>This is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landauer%27s_principle">Landauer limit</a>, and it came after many decades of arguments concerning Maxwell&#8217;s demon and the relation between information and entropy.</p>
<p>In fact, these arguments are still not finished.  For example, here&#8217;s an argument that the Landauer limit is not as solid as widely believed:</p>

<p>But something like the Landauer limit almost surely holds under some conditions!  And if it holds, it puts some limits on what organisms can do.  That&#8217;s what David Wolpert spoke about at our workshop! You can see his slides here:</p>

					<p>The resounding lack of comment to this series of posts confirms my theory that a blog post that says &#8220;go somewhere else and read something&#8221; will never be popular.  Even if it&#8217;s &#8220;go somewhere else and watch a video&#8221;, this is too much like saying</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Hi!  Want to talk?  Okay, go into that other room and watch TV, then come back when you&#8217;re done and we&#8217;ll talk about it.

<p>But no matter: our workshop on <a href="http://www.nimbios.org/workshops/WS_entropy">Information and Entropy in Biological Systems</a> was really exciting!  I want to make it available to the world as much as possible.

					<p><a href="http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~hartelab/">John Harte</a> of U. C.

<blockquote><p>
<strong>Abstract.</strong> Constrained maximization of information entropy (MaxEnt) yields least-biased probability distributions. In statistical physics, this powerful inference method yields classical statistical mechanics/thermodynamics under the constraints imposed by conservation laws.  I apply MaxEnt to macroecology, the study of the distribution, abundance, and energetics of species in ecosystems.  With constraints derived from ratios of ecological state variables, I show that MaxEnt yields realistic abundance distributions, species-area relationships, spatial aggregation patterns, and body-size distributions over a wide range of taxonomic groups, habitats and spatial scales.  I conclude with a brief summary of some of the major opportunities at the frontier of MaxEnt-based macroecological theory.  </p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> I am a bit of the odd man out in that I will not talk that much about information and entropy, but instead about neutral theory and niche theory in ecology. My interest in coming to this workshop is in part out of an interest in what greater insights we can get into neutral models and stochastic population dynamics in general using entropy and information theory.</p>
<p>I will present the niche and neutral theories of the maintenance of diversity of competing species in ecology, and explain the dynamics included in neutral models in ecology. I will also briefly explain how one can derive a species abundance distribution from neutral models. I will present the view that neutral models have the potential to serve as more process-based null models than previously used in ecology for detecting the signature of niches and habitat filtering. However, tests of neutral theory in ecology have not as of yet been as useful as tests of neutral theory in evolutionary biology, because they leave open the possibility that pattern is influenced by “demographic complexity” rather than niches. I will mention briefly some of the work I’ve been doing to try to construct better tests of neutral theory.</p>
<p>Finally I’ll mention some connections that have been made so far between predictions of entropy theory and predictions of neutral theory in ecology and evolution.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p> <b>Abstract.</b> The methods of Maximum Entropy have been deployed for some years to address the problem of species abundance distributions. In this approach, it is important to identify the correct weighting factors, or priors, to be applied before maximising the entropy function subject to constraints. The forms of such priors depend not only on the exact problem but can also depend on the way it is set up; priors are determined by the underlying dynamics of the complex system under consideration. The problem is one of statistical mechanics and it is the properties of the system that yield the correct MaxEnt priors, appropriate to the way the problem is framed. Here I calculate, in several different ways, the species abundance distribution resulting when individuals in a community are born and die independently. In<br />
the usual formulation the prior distribution for the number of species over the number of individuals is 1/n; the problem can be reformulated in terms of the distribution of individuals over species classes, with a uniform prior. Results are obtained using master equations for the dynamics and separately through the combinatoric methods of elementary statistical mechanics; the MaxEnt priors then emerge a posteriori. The first object is to establish the log series species abundance distribution as the outcome of per capita guild dynamics. The second is to clarify the true nature and origin of priors in the language of MaxEnt. Finally, I consider how it may come about that the distribution is similar to log series in the event that filled niches dominate species abundance. For the general ecologist, there are two messages. First, that species abundance distributions are determined largely by population sorting through fractional processes (resulting in the 1/n factor) and secondly that useful information is likely to be found only in departures from the log series. For the MaxEnt practitioner, the message is that the prior with respect to which the entropy is to be maximised is determined by the nature of the problem and the way in which it is formulated.

<blockquote><p>
A number of fundamental mathematical models of the evolutionary process exhibit dynamics that can be difficult to understand analytically. Here we show that a precise mathematical analogy can be drawn between certain evolutionary and thermodynamic systems, allowing application of the powerful machinery of statistical physics to analysis of a family of evolutionary models. Analytical results that follow directly from this approach include the steady-state distribution of fixed genotypes and the load in finite populations. The analogy with statistical physics also reveals that, contrary to a basic tenet of the nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution, the frequencies of adaptive and deleterious substitutions at steady state are equal. Finally, just as the free energy function quantitatively characterizes the balance between energy and entropy, a free fitness function provides an analytical expression for the balance between natural selection and stochastic drift.
