					<p>There&#8217;s a fungus that infects many kinds of amphibians.  Some get wiped out entirely&#8212;but it&#8217;s harbored harmlessly by others, so it&#8217;s impossible to eradicate.  Over a hundred species have disappeared in the last 20 years!</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve got to read this:</p>
<p>&bull; Joseph R. Mendelson III, <a href="http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/lessons-of-the-lost/2">Lessons of the lost</a>, <i>American Scientist</i> 99 (November-December 2011), 438.</p>
<p>The fungus causes a disease called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chytridiomycosis">chytridiomycosis</a>.  The effects are gruesome: when spores land on a susceptible amphibian, they quickly sprout and form a vase-shaped structure that harvests energy from the animal&#8217;s skin.  This produces more spores, which swim around using flagella and spread.  The disease progresses as these reinfect the host.  The victim may become lethargic, lose skin over its body, go into convulsions, and die.</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chytridiomycosis"><img width="450" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Chytridiomycosis.jpg/797px-Chytridiomycosis.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>Amphibian populations have been dropping rapidly worldwide since the 1980s.  There were about 6500 species, but now 30% of these are endangered, about <a>130 are &#8216;missing&#8217;</a>, and <a href="http://www.amphibianark.org/the-crisis/frightening-statistics/">about 30 are extinct in the wild</a>.  </p>
<p>There were many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decline_in_amphibian_populations">theories about the cause of this decline</a>, but now we know this disease is playing a big role.  As Mendelson says:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Herpetologists and wildlife biologists began observing inexplicable disappearances of amphibians around the globe in the mid-1970s and especially by the mid-1980s but were at a complete loss to explain them. Finally, in the late 1990s, an insightful team of pathologists at the U.S. National Zoo, led by <a href="http://www.sciencenews.org/sn_arc98/7_4_98/fob9.htm">Don Nichols</a>, collaborated with one of the few chytrid fungus scholars in the world, <a href="http://www.umaine.edu/chytrids/index.html">Joyce Longcore</a>, and identified this quite unusual new genus and species. </p>
<p>Conservationists and disease ecologists were unprepared for the reality of a pathogen capable of directly and rapidly—mere months!—causing the elimination of a population or an entire species that was otherwise robust. Classical host-pathogen theory held that such dramatic consequences to the host population or species were only realized when the host population was already drastically reduced in size or otherwise compromised. The concept of a lightning extinction was foreign to researchers and conservationists, and we argued vehemently about it throughout the 1990s at symposia worldwide. </p>
<p>In retrospect, the scenario of a spreading pathogen is parsimonious and clear, but in the midst of the massacre we were entangled in logical quagmires along these lines: “<i>The disappearances cannot be the result of disease; diseases are not capable of such.</i>” Not to mention the fact that the smoking gun, the pathogen itself, was not described until 1999. While we were debating the issue, a terrible lesson was playing out for us around the world as an unknown disease decimated amphibian populations.
</p></blockquote>
<p>What are the &#8216;lessons&#8217; that Mendelson is talking about?  Here are some:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Our powerlessness in this terrible crisis must be balanced by increased efforts in realms that we can control, such as reducing carbon emissions to protect what habitat remains from chemical and physical disruption. We can go further and restore what has been wounded but can still be salvaged. We need to inspire and fund truly innovative research on pathogens in order to better predict and thwart emerging infectious diseases. The lessons we learn here will extend far beyond the amphibians. We must support funding for programs such as the <a href="http://www.amphibianark.org">Amphibian Ark</a> and the <a href="http://www.amphibianark.org/the-crisis/amphibian-survival-alliance/">Amphibian Survival Alliance</a>. We must keep looking for species gone missing, and continue biodiversity surveys, despite the sometimes paralyzing depression that both activities can induce in this era. But especially, we need to pay close attention to the lessons that legions of dead amphibians are teaching us. I note with some satisfaction that our colleagues in bat research and conservation did not spend a decade arguing whether the fungus that causes white-nose syndrome could possibly eliminate entire colonies of bats in a single season. Our colleagues assumed that it was possible and reacted quickly. We can thank the amphibians for leaving us that lesson, but at such cost.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, millions of bats in America have died from a new fungal disease called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_nose_syndrome">white-nose syndrome</a>.  </p>
<p>What role, if any, do people play in the spread of these new diseases?  Why are they happening now?   </p>
<p>In the case of amphibians, people helped spread American bullfrogs.  These are resistant to the disease, but carry it.  They&#8217;ve largely taken over here in Singapore.</p>
<p>Global warming seems <i>not</i> to be responsible, because the worst outbreaks happen at high elevations, where it&#8217;s cool: that&#8217;s where the fungus thrives.</p>
<p>As for the bats, the same fungus that&#8217;s killing bats in America is found in healthy bats in Europe, which suggests the disease spread from there.  People might carry spores on their clothes from infected caves to not-yet-infected ones, so visitors to caves with bats are being asked to limit their activities, and disinfect clothing and equipment.  It&#8217;s completely against the rules to visit some caves now.</p>
<p>There have been successful attempts to cure some amphibians of chytridiomycosis:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://csm.jmu.edu/biology/harrisrn/site/Home.html">Reid Harris</a> of James Madison University has <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/blog/environment/2008/06/probiotics-for-frogs.html">claims</a> that coating frogs with <i>Janthinobacterium lividum</i> protects them from chytridiomycosis.</p>
<p>&bull; A team of scientists <a href="http://www.int-res.com/articles/dao_oa/d084p009.pdf">published a paper</a> claiming that Archey&#8217;s frog (<i>Leiopelma archeyi</i>), a critically endangered species in New Zealand, was successfully cured of chytridiomycosis by applying chloramphenicol topically.</p>
<p>&bull; Don Nichols <a href="http://webspinners.com/coloherp/cb-news/Vol-28/cbn-0111/Chytridiomycosis.html">claims</a> to have cured several species of frogs using a drug called itraconazole.</p>
<p>&bull; Jay Redmond at WWT Slimbridge, Gloucestershire <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10252907">claims</a> that raising poison dart frogs in water containing Rooibos tea (<i>Aspalathus linearis</i>) wards off chytridiomycosis.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amphibianark.org/about-us/">Amphibian Ark</a> is trying to keep populations alive that have died in the wild.  They have a list of suggestions on <a href="http://www.amphibianark.org/the-crisis/what-can-i-do-to-help/">what you can do to help</a>.  For starters:</p>
<p>&bull; Don&#8217;t ever release pet amphibians into the wild.</p>
<p>&bull; Build a frog pond: <a href="http://www.treewalkers.org/operation-frog-pond">here&#8217;s how</a>.  Even in arid places like Riverside California, our friends who built some ponds soon found them occupied by sweetly chirping frogs.</p>
<p>&bull;  Get involved in collaborations that promote sustainable breeding and management, like the <a href="http://www.treewalkers.org/amphibian-steward-network">Amphibian Steward Network</a>.</p>
<p>&bull; Figure things out.  Zoos don&#8217;t even know how to breed common toads without using artificial hormone injections!   If you could find a way, maybe the same technique could be used with threatened species.</p>
<p>&bull; If you&#8217;re a student, go to James Madison University and work with <a href="http://csm.jmu.edu/biology/harrisrn/site/Home.html">Reid Harris</a>:</p>

				<small>5 December, 2011</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>Here&#8217;s a quick followup to our discussion of the <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/11/17/wild-cats-of-sumatra/">wild cats of Sumatra</a> caught on camera by the World Wildlife Foundation.  Recently there have been sightings of rare wild cats in Arizona!</p>
<p>&bull; Marc Lacey, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/05/us/in-arizona-rare-sightings-of-ocelots-and-jaguars.html?_r=1&amp;ref=earth">In southern Arizona, rare sightings of ocelots and jaguars send shivers</a>, <i>New York Times</i>, 4 December 2011.</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://azstarnet.com/news/local/guide-describes-roaring-powerful-jaguar/article_2073df7a-4fb6-55bb-b1d9-20c521bc0e41.html">Guide describes roaring, powerful jaguar</a>, <i>Arizona Daily Star</i>, 23 November 2011.</p>
<p>For example, consider Donnie Fenn, who specializes in hunting and killing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cougar">mountain lions</a> (also known as cougars or pumas).  He was taking his 10-year-old daughter out on her first hunt when his pack of hounds took off and cornered something in a tree.  He then saw with the telephoto lens of his camera that it wasn&#8217;t a mountain lion&mdash;it was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaguar">jaguar</a>, which is about twice as big!</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;It&#8217;s the most amazing thing that&#8217;s ever happened to me,&#8221; said Fenn, who leads hunters to mountain lions with his dogs. &#8220;To be honest with you&mdash;I got to see it in real life, my daughter got to see it, but I hope never to encounter it again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was nervous, scared, everything. It was just the aggressiveness&mdash;the power it had, the snarling. It wasn&#8217;t a snarl like a lion. It was a roar. I&#8217;ve never heard anything like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fenn was thrilled as well as scared. He had never expected to see such a large, endangered cat so early in his life, at age 32, he said. A lifelong hunter and Benson resident, he runs the mountain lion guide service as a sideline while working full time in an excavating business. He described his one-hour encounter with the jaguar as &#8220;a dream come true.&#8221;</p>
<p>He came away respectful of its power, speed and size.</p>
<p>&#8220;All my dogs took a pretty good beating. They had puncture wounds. &#8230; I got to see it in real life, and I&#8217;m glad, but I hope to never encounter it again,&#8221; he repeated.
</p></blockquote>
<p>He crept up close and took photos and a video of the jaguar:</p>

<p>He also notified state wildlife officials, who were later able to find hair samples left behind by the animal and a tree trunk that showed signs of being climbed by a large clawed animal.  They believe he saw an adult male jaguar that weighed about 90 kilograms.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaguar">jaguar</a>, <i>Panthera onca</i>, is the third-largest cat in the world, only outranked by the lion and tiger.  It&#8217;s the only surviving New World member of the genus <i> Panthera</i>.  For example, there was once an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_lion">American lion</a>, but that went extinct 10,000 years ago, along with a lot of other large mammals, after people showed up.  DNA evidence shows that the lion, tiger, leopard, jaguar, snow leopard, and clouded leopard share a common ancestor, and that this whole gang is between 6 and 10 million years old.  (The so-called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cougar">&#8216;mountain lion&#8217;</a>, <i>Puma concolor</i>, is not in this group.)</p>
<p>Jaguars have mostly been killed off in the United States, but they survive from Mexico to Central and South America all the way down to Paraguay and northern Argentina.  They are listed as &#8216;near threatened&#8217; by the IUCN, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN_Red_List">International Union for the Conservation of Nature</a>.</p>
<p>The Arizona Fish and Game Department has also announced two reliable sightings of ocelots this year!</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocelot"><img width="440" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Ocelot.jpg/640px-Ocelot.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocelot">ocelot</a>, <i>Leopardus pardalis</i>, is a much smaller fellow, about the size of a domestic cat.    Ocelots live in many parts of South and Central America and Mexico, and they&#8217;re listed as being of &#8216;least concern&#8217; by the IUCN.  Once their range extended up into the chaparral thickets of the Gulf Coast of south and eastern Texas, as well as part of Arizona, Louisiana, and Arkansas.  But by now they are very hard to find in the United States.  They seem to eke out an existence only in several small areas of dense thicket in South Texas&#8230; and, we now know, Arizona!</p>

				<h2><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/11/24/lynn-margulis-1938-2011/" rel="bookmark">Lynn Margulis, 1938-2011</a></h2>
				<small>24 November, 2011</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynn_Margulis">Lynn Margulis</a> died on Tuesday, the 22nd of November.  </p>
<div align="center">
<img width="200" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Lynn_Margulis.jpg" /></div>
<p>She is most famous for her theory of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endosymbiotic_theory">endosymbiosis</a>, which says that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote">eukaryotic</a> cells&#8212;the complicated cells of protozoa, animals, plants, and fungi&#8212;were formed in a series of stages where one organism <i>swallowed</i> another but, instead of digesting it, took it on as a symbiotic partner!</p>
<p>As a young faculty member at Boston University, she wrote a paper on this theory.  It was rejected by about fifteen scientific journals, but eventually accepted:</p>
<p>&bull; Lynn Sagan, On the origin of mitosing cells, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022519367900793"><i>J. Theor. Bio.</i></a> <b>14</b> (1967), 255–274. </p>
<p>(At the time she was married to the well-known astronomer Carl Sagan; she later wrote a number of books with their son Dorion.)</p>
<p>While Lynn Margulis was not the first to suggest that endosymbiosis played a major role in evolution, her brilliant and endlessly energetic advocacy of this idea helped trigger a scientific revolution.  By now, almost all biologists agree that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroplast">chloroplasts</a>, the little green packages where photosynthesis happens in plant cells, were originally free-living bacteria of their own.  Here&#8217;s a model of a chloroplast:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroplast"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/%C3%9Cberseemuseum_Bremen_2009_238.JPG/320px-%C3%9Cberseemuseum_Bremen_2009_238.JPG" /></a></div>
<p>As you can see, it&#8217;s quite a complex world of its own.  Biologists also believe that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion">mitochondria</a>, the &#8216;powerhouses&#8217; of eukaryotic cells:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Animal_mitochondrion_diagram_en_%28edit%29.svg/380px-Animal_mitochondrion_diagram_en_%28edit%29.svg.png" /></a></div>
<p>were originally bacteria.  </p>
<p>Indeed, both chloroplasts and mitochondria still have their own DNA, and they reproduce like bacteria, through fission.  This is very useful in research on human populations, since  mitochondrial DNA is passed down, not through the sperm cells, but only through the egg cells&#8212;which means it&#8217;s passed down from mothers to daughters, with sons as a mere sideshow.  On the other hand, Y chromosomes go down from father to son.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endosymbiotic_theory#Evidence">lot more</a> evidence for endosymbiosis as the origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts&#8230; and in fact, we can see this process going on today in various organisms.  There are also many other ways in which organisms <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_gene_transfer">pass genes to each other</a>.</p>
<p>This led Margulis to advocate a worldview in which the &#8216;tree&#8217; of life is replaced by something more like a &#8216;thicket&#8217;:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Horizental-gene-transfer.jpg/414px-Horizental-gene-transfer.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>It also suggests that <i>competition</i> between organisms is part of a bigger story where <i>the formation of partnerships</i> plays a major role.  She has written <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynn_Margulis#Select_publications_and_bibliography">many popular books on this</a>, and they make great reading, even though some of her ideas are still controversial.</p>
<p>In 1995, the famous evolutionary biologist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins">Richard Dawkins</a> wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
I greatly admire Lynn Margulis&#8217;s sheer courage and stamina in sticking by the endosymbiosis theory, and carrying it through from being an unorthodoxy to an orthodoxy. I&#8217;m referring to the theory that the eukaryotic cell is a symbiotic union of primitive prokaryotic cells. This is one of the great achievements of twentieth-century evolutionary biology, and I greatly admire her for it.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ll end by quoting an excerpt from this essay, which you can read in its entirety online:</p>
<p>&bull; Lynn Margulis, <a href="http://www.edge.org/documents/ThirdCulture/n-Ch.7.html">Gaia is a tough bitch</a>, in <i>The Third Culture: Beyond the Scientific Revolution</i>, ed. John Brockman, Simon &amp; Schuster, 1995.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s a good sample of how she wasn&#8217;t afraid to stir up controversy.  Indeed, you&#8217;ll see her poking Dawkins with a sharp stick at the same time he was complimenting her! </p>
<p>More importantly, you&#8217;ll get a sense of how her work helped push evolutionary biology away from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Darwinism">neo-Darwinism</a>, also known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_evolutionary_synthesis">Modern Synthesis</a>.  This approach tried to explain all evolution as a process of populations slowly changing through random mutation and natural selection.  Now biologists are struggling to formulate an <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=12173&amp;mode=toc">Extended Synthesis</a> which takes many more processes into account.</p>
<p>Her remarks also some contain good warnings for mathematicians and physicists, such as myself, who want to dabble in biology.  Physics may be defined as &#8216;the study of natural systems that can be accurately modeled by beautiful mathematics&#8217;.  That&#8217;s why we can learn a surprising amount about physics just by sitting around scribbling.  But living systems always surprise us, since they&#8217;re always more rich and complex than our models.  So, biology requires more emphasis on experiment, observation, and perhaps <a href="http://friends-of-wisdom.com/readings/Keller.pdf">a feeling for the organism</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
I work in evolutionary biology, but with cells and microorganisms. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins">Richard Dawkins</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Smith">John Maynard Smith</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_C._Williams">George Williams</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Lewontin">Richard Lewontin</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niles_Eldridge">Niles Eldredge</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Jay_Gould">Stephen Jay Gould</a> all come out of the zoological tradition, which suggests to me that, in the words of our colleague <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Robson">Simon Robson</a>, they deal with a data set some three billion years out of date. Eldredge and Gould and their many colleagues tend to codify an incredible ignorance of where the real action is in evolution, as they limit the domain of interest to animals&mdash;including, of course, people. All very interesting,       but animals are very tardy on the evolutionary scene, and they give us little real insight into the major sources of evolution&#8217;s creativity. It&#8217;s as if you wrote a four-volume tome supposedly on world history but beginning in the year 1800 at Fort Dearborn and the founding of Chicago.        You might be entirely correct about the nineteenth-century transformation of Fort Dearborn into a thriving lakeside metropolis, but it would hardly be world history.</p>
<p> By &#8220;codifying ignorance&#8221; I refer in part to the fact that they miss four out of the five kingdoms of life. Animals are only one of these kingdoms.  They miss bacteria, protoctista, fungi, and plants. They take a small and interesting chapter in the book of evolution and extrapolate it into  the entire encyclopedia of life. Skewed and limited in their perspective, they are not wrong so much as grossly uninformed.</p>
<p> Of what are they ignorant? Chemistry, primarily, because the language of evolutionary biology is the language of chemistry, and most of them ignore chemistry. I don&#8217;t want to lump them all together, because, first of all, Gould and Eldredge have found out very clearly that gradual evolutionary  changes through time, expected by Darwin to be documented in the fossil record, are not the way it happened. Fossil morphologies persist for long periods of time, and after stasis, discontinuities are observed. I don&#8217;t think these observations are even debatable. John Maynard Smith, an engineer by training, knows much of his biology secondhand. He seldom deals with live organisms. He computes and he reads. I suspect that it&#8217;s very hard for him to have insight into any group of organisms when he does not deal with them directly. Biologists, especially, need direct sensory communication with the live beings they study and about which they write.</p>
<p> Reconstructing evolutionary history through fossils&mdash;paleontology&mdash;is a valid approach, in my opinion, but paleontologists must work simultaneously with modern-counterpart organisms and with &#8220;neontologists&#8221;&mdash;that is, biologists. Gould, Eldredge, and Lewontin have made very valuable contributions. But the Dawkins&#8211;Williams&#8211;Maynard Smith tradition emerges from a history that I doubt they see in its Anglophone social context. Darwin claimed that populations of organisms change gradually through time as their members are weeded out, which is his basic idea  of evolution through natural selection. Mendel, who developed the rules   for genetic traits passing from one generation to another, made it very  clear that while those traits reassort, they don&#8217;t change over time. A white flower mated to a red flower has pink offspring, and if that pink flower is crossed with another pink flower the offspring that result are just as red or just as white or just as pink as the original parent or grandparent. Species of organisms, Mendel insisted, don&#8217;t change through time. The mixture or blending that produced the pink is superficial. The genes are simply shuffled around to come out in different combinations, but those same combinations generate exactly the same types. Mendel&#8217;s observations are incontrovertible.</p>
<p> So <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._S._Haldane">J. B. S. Haldane</a>, without a doubt a brilliant person, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher">R. A. Fisher</a>,  a mathematician, generated an entire school of English-speaking evolutionists,  as they developed the neo-Darwinist population-genetic analysis to reconcile two unreconcilable views: Darwin&#8217;s evolutionary view with Mendel&#8217;s pragmatic, anti-evolutionary concept. They invented a language of population genetics in the 1920s to 1950s called neo-Darwinism, to rationalize these two fields. They mathematized their work and began to believe in it, spreading the word widely in Great Britain, the United States, and beyond. France and other countries resisted neo-Darwinism, but some Japanese and other investigators     joined in the &#8220;explanation&#8221; activity.</p>
<p> Both <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins">Dawkins</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Lewontin">Lewontin</a>, who consider themselves far apart from each other in many respects, belong to this tradition.  Lewontin visited an economics class at the University of Massachusetts a few years ago to talk to the students. In a kind of neo-Darwinian jockeying, he said that  evolutionary changes are due to the Fisher&#8211;Haldane mechanisms: mutation, emigration, immigration, and the like. At the end of the hour, he said  that none of the consequences of the details of his analysis had been shown empirically. His elaborate cost-benefit mathematical treatment was devoid of chemistry and biology. I asked him why, if none of it could be shown experimentally or in the field, he was so wedded to presenting  a cost-benefit explanation derived from phony human social-economic &#8220;theory.&#8221;  Why, when he himself was pointing to serious flaws related to the fundamental assumptions, did he want to teach this nonsense? His response was that there were two reasons: the first was &#8220;P.E.&#8221; &#8220;P.E.?,&#8221; I asked. &#8220;What is      P.E.? Population explosion? Punctuated equilibrium? Physical education?&#8221; &#8220;No,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;P.E. is `physics envy,'&#8221; which is a syndrome in which      scientists in other disciplines yearn for the mathematically explicit models of physics. His second reason was even more insidious: if he didn&#8217;t couch his studies in the neo-Darwinist thought style (archaic and totally     inappropriate language, in my opinion), he wouldn&#8217;t be able to obtain grant money that was set up to support this kind of work.</p>
<p> The neo-Darwinist population-genetics tradition is reminiscent of phrenology, I think, and is a kind of science that can expect exactly the same fate. It will look ridiculous in retrospect, because it is ridiculous. I&#8217;ve always felt that way, even as a more-than-adequate student of population genetics with a superb teacher&mdash;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_F._Crow">James F. Crow</a>, at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. At the very end of the semester, the last week was spent on discussing the actual observational and experimental studies related to the models, but none of the outcomes of the experiments matched  the theory.</p>

<p>This passage shows her tough side&#8212;these are the top names in evolutionary biology that she&#8217;s criticizing here, after all.  But when I saw her speak, she was engaging and fun!  You can see that yourself in these interviews.  Hear how she started as a bad student in 4th grade, why her laboratory budget got cut to $0 in 2004&#8230; and get a sense of her career, personality, and ideas.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p><i>joint with <b><a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Jacob+Biamonte">Jacob Biamonte</a></b></i></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve seen how Petri nets can be used to describe chemical reactions.  Indeed our <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/03/31/network-theory-part-2/">very first example</a> came from chemistry:</p>
<div align="center"><img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/chemistryNetBasicA.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>However, chemists rarely use the formalism of Petri nets.  They use a different but entirely equivalent formalism, called &#8216;reaction networks&#8217;.  So now we&#8217;d like to tell you about those. </p>
<p>You may wonder: why bother with another formalism, if it&#8217;s equivalent to the one we&#8217;ve already seen?   Well, one goal of this network theory program is to get people from different subjects to talk to each other&mdash;or at least be <i>able</i> to.  This requires setting up some dictionaries to translate between formalisms.  Furthermore, lots of deep results on stochastic Petri nets are being proved by chemists&mdash;but phrased in terms of reaction networks.  So you need to learn this other formalism to read their papers.  Finally, this other formalism is actually better in some ways!</p>
<p><b> Reaction networks </b> </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a reaction network:</p>
<div align="center"><img width="200" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/chemical_reaction_network_part_17_I.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>This network involves 5 <b>species</b>: that is, different kinds of things.  They could be atoms, molecules, ions or whatever: chemists call all of these <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_species">species</a>, and there&#8217;s no need to limit the applications to chemistry: in population biology, they could even be biological species!  We&#8217;re calling them A, B, C, D, and E, but in applications, we&#8217;d call them by specific names like CO<sub>2</sub> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup>, or &#8216;rabbit&#8217; and &#8216;wolf&#8217;, or whatever.</p>
<p>This network also involves 5 <b>reactions</b>, which are shown as arrows.  Each reaction turns one bunch of species into another.  So, written out more longwindedly, we&#8217;ve got these reactions:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+%5Cto+B&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A &#92;to B" class="latex" /> </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B+%5Cto+A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B &#92;to A" class="latex" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+%2B+C+%5Cto+D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A + C &#92;to D" class="latex" /> </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B+%2B+E+%5Cto+A+%2B+C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B + E &#92;to A + C" class="latex" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B+%2B+E+%5Cto+D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B + E &#92;to D" class="latex" />  </p>
<p>If you remember how Petri nets work, you can see how to translate any reaction network into a Petri net, or vice versa.  For example, the reaction network we&#8217;ve just seen gives this Petri net:</p>
<div align="center"><img width="350" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/petri_net_part_17_I.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>Each species corresponds to a <b>state</b> of this Petri net, drawn as a yellow circle.  And each reaction corresponds to <b>transition</b> of this Petri net, drawn as a blue square.  The arrows say how many things of each species appear as input or output to each transition.  There&#8217;s less explicit emphasis on complexes in the Petri net notation, but you can read them off if you want them.</p>
<p>In chemistry, a bunch of species is called a &#8216;complex&#8217;.  But what do I mean by &#8216;bunch&#8217;, exactly?  Well, I mean that in a given complex, each species can show up 0,1,2,3&#8230; or any natural number of times. So, we can formalize things like this:</p>
<p><b>Definition.</b>  Given a set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S" class="latex" /> of <b>species</b>, a <b>complex</b> of those species is a function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C%3A+S+%5Cto+%5Cmathbb%7BN%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C: S &#92;to &#92;mathbb{N}" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, a reaction network is a graph whose vertices are labelled by complexes.  Unfortunately, the word <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_%28mathematics%29">&#8216;graph&#8217;</a> means different things in mathematics&mdash;appallingly many things!  Everyone agrees that a graph has vertices and edges, but there are lots of choices about the details.  Most notably:</p>
<p>&bull; We can either put arrows on the edges, or not.</p>
<p>&bull;  We can either allow more than one edge between vertices, or not.</p>
<p>&bull;  We can either allow edges from a vertex to itself, or not.</p>
<p>If we say &#8216;no&#8217; in every case we get the concept of &#8216;simple graph&#8217;, which we discussed <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/11/04/network-theory-part-16/">last time</a>.  At the other extreme, if we say &#8216;yes&#8217; in every case we get the concept of &#8216;directed multigraph&#8217;, which is what we want now.  A bit more formally:</p>
<p><b>Definition.</b>  A <b>directed multigraph</b> consists of a set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="V" class="latex" /> of <b>vertices</b>, a set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="E" class="latex" /> of <b>edges</b>, and functions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s%2Ct%3A+E+%5Cto+V&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="s,t: E &#92;to V" class="latex" /> saying the <b>source</b> and <b>target</b> of each edge.</p>
<p>Given this, we can say:</p>
<p><b>Definition.</b>  A <b>reaction network</b> is a set of species together with a directed multigraph whose vertices are labelled by complexes of those species.</p>
<p>You can now prove that reaction networks are equivalent to Petri nets:</p>
<p><b>Puzzle 1.</b>  Show that any reaction network gives a <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/03/31/network-theory-part-2/">Petri net</a>, and vice versa.  </p>
<p>In a stochastic Petri net each transition is labelled by a <b>rate constant</b>: that is, a numbers in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5B0%2C%5Cinfty%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="[0,&#92;infty)" class="latex" />.  This lets us write down some differential equations saying how species turn into each other.  So, let&#8217;s make this definition (which is not standard, but will clarify things for us):</p>
<p><b>Definition.</b>  A <b>stochastic reaction network</b> is a reaction network where each reaction is labelled by a rate constant. </p>
<p>Now you can do this:</p>
<p><b>Puzzle 2.</b>  Show that any stochastic reaction network gives a <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/03/31/network-theory-part-2/">stochastic Petri net</a>, and vice versa.  </p>
<p>For extra credit, show that in each of these puzzles we actually get an equivalence of categories! For this you need to define morphisms between Petri nets, morphisms between reaction networks, and similarly for stochastic Petric nets and stochastic reaction networks.  If you get stuck, ask Eugene Lerman for advice.  There are different ways to define morphisms, but he knows a <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.5359">cool one</a>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been downplaying category theory so far, but it&#8217;s been lurking beneath everything we do, and someday it may rise to the surface.</p>
<h4> The deficiency zero theorem </h4>
<p>You may have already noticed one advantage of reaction networks over Petri nets: they&#8217;re quicker to draw.  This is true even for tiny examples.  For example, this reaction network:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2+X_1+%2B+X_2+%5Cleftrightarrow+2+X_3+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="2 X_1 + X_2 &#92;leftrightarrow 2 X_3 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>corresponds to this Petri net:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="300" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/bimolecular-reaction.png" alt="" />
</div>
<p>But there&#8217;s also a deeper advantage.  As we saw in <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/09/09/network-theory-part-8/">Part 8</a>, any stochastic Petri net gives two equations:</p>
<p>&bull; The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_equation"><b>master equation</b></a>, which says how the <i>probability that we have a given number of things of each species</i> changes with time.</p>
<p>&bull; The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_equation"><b>rate equation</b></a>, which says how the <i>expected number of things in each state</i> changes with time.   </p>
<p>The simplest solutions of these equations are the equilibrium solutions, where nothing depends on time. Back in <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/09/13/network-theory-part-9/">Part 9</a>, we explained when an equilibrium solution of the rate equation gives an equilibrium solution of the master equation.    But when is there an equilibrium solution of the rate equation in the first place?  </p>
<p>Feinberg&#8217;s &#8216;deficiency zero theorem&#8217; gives a handy sufficient condition.  And this condition is best stated using reaction networks!  But to understand it, we need to understand the &#8216;deficiency&#8217; of a reaction network.  So let&#8217;s define that, and they say what all the words in the definition mean:</p>
<p><b>Definition.</b>  The <b>deficiency</b> of a reaction network is:</p>
<p>&bull; the number of vertices </p>
<p>minus </p>
<p>&bull; the number of connected components</p>
<p>minus </p>
<p>&bull; the dimension of the stoichiometric subspace.  </p>
<p>The first two concepts here are easy.  A reaction network is a graph (okay, a directed multigraph).  So, it has some number of vertices, and also some number of connected components.  Two vertices lie in the same <b>connected component</b> iff you can get from one to the other by a path <i>where you don&#8217;t care which way the arrows point</i>.  For example, this reaction network:</p>
<div align="center"><img width="200" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/chemical_reaction_network_part_17_I.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>has 5 vertices and 2 connected components.  </p>
<p>So, what&#8217;s the &#8216;stoichiometric subspace&#8217;?  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoichiometry">&#8216;Stoichiometry&#8217;</a> is a scary-sounding word.  According to the Wikipedia article:</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8216;Stoichiometry&#8217; is derived from the Greek words στοιχεῖον (<i>stoicheion</i>, meaning element) and μέτρον (<i>metron</i>, meaning measure.) In patristic Greek, the word <i>Stoichiometria</i> was used by Nicephorus to refer to the number of line counts of the canonical New Testament and some of the Apocrypha.
</p></blockquote>
<p>But for us, stoichiometry is just the art of counting species.  To do this, we can form a vector space <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5ES&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}^S" class="latex" /> where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S" class="latex" /> is the set of species.  A vector in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5ES&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}^S" class="latex" /> is a function from species to real numbers, saying how much of each species is present.  Any complex gives a vector in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5ES&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}^S" class="latex" />, because it&#8217;s actually a function from species to <i>natural</i> numbers.  </p>
<p><b>Definition.</b>  The <b>stoichiometric subspace</b> of a reaction network is the subspace <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BStoch%7D+%5Csubseteq+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5ES&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{Stoch} &#92;subseteq &#92;mathbb{R}^S" class="latex" /> spanned by vectors of the form <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+-+y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x - y" class="latex" /> where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y" class="latex" /> are complexes connected by a reaction.</p>
<p>&#8216;Complexes connected by a reaction&#8217; makes sense because vertices in the reaction network are complexes, and edges are reactions.  Let&#8217;s see how it works in our example:</p>
<div align="center"><img width="200" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/chemical_reaction_network_part_17_I.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>Each complex here can be seen as a vector in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5ES&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}^S" class="latex" />, which is a vector space whose basis we can call <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%2C+B%2C+C%2C+D%2C+E&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A, B, C, D, E" class="latex" />.  Each reaction gives a difference of two vectors coming from complexes:</p>
<p>&bull; The reaction <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+%5Cto+B&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A &#92;to B" class="latex" /> gives the vector <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B+-+A.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B - A." class="latex" /></p>
<p>&bull; The reaction <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B+%5Cto+A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B &#92;to A" class="latex" /> gives the vector <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+-+B.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A - B." class="latex" /></p>
<p>&bull; The reaction <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+%2B+C+%5Cto+D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A + C &#92;to D" class="latex" /> gives the vector <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D+-+A+-+C.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="D - A - C." class="latex" /></p>
<p>&bull; The reaction <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B+%2B+E+%5Cto+A+%2B+C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B + E &#92;to A + C" class="latex" /> gives the vector <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+%2B+C+-+B+-+E.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A + C - B - E." class="latex" /></p>
<p>&bull; The reaction <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B+%2B+E+%5Cto+D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B + E &#92;to D" class="latex" /> gives the vector <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D+-+B+-+E.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="D - B - E." class="latex" /></p>
<p>The pattern is obvious, I hope.</p>
<p>These 5 vectors span the stoichiometric subspace.   But this subspace isn&#8217;t 5-dimensional, because these vectors are linearly dependent!  The first vector is the negative of the second one.  The last is the sum of the previous two.   And those are all the linear dependencies, so the stoichiometric subspace is 3 dimensional.  For example, it&#8217;s spanned by these 3 linearly independent vectors: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+-+B%2C+D+-+A+-+C%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A - B, D - A - C," class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D+-+B+-+E&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="D - B - E" class="latex" />.  </p>
<p>I hope you see the moral of this example: the stoichiometric subspace is the space of <i>ways to move in</i> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5ES&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}^S" class="latex" /> <i> that are allowed by the reactions in our reaction network!</i>   And this is important because the rate equation describes how the amount of each species changes as time passes.  So, it describes a point moving around in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5ES&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}^S" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>Thus, if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BStoch%7D+%5Csubseteq+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5ES&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{Stoch} &#92;subseteq &#92;mathbb{R}^S" class="latex" /> is the stoichiometric subspace, and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%28t%29+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5ES&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x(t) &#92;in &#92;mathbb{R}^S" class="latex" /> is a solution of the rate equation, then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%28t%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x(t)" class="latex" /> always stays within the set</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%280%29+%2B+%5Cmathrm%7BStoch%7D+%3D+%5C%7B+x%280%29+%2B+y+%5Ccolon+%5C%3B+y+%5Cin+%5Cmathrm%7BStoch%7D+%5C%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x(0) + &#92;mathrm{Stoch} = &#92;{ x(0) + y &#92;colon &#92;; y &#92;in &#92;mathrm{Stoch} &#92;} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Mathematicians would call this set the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coset">coset</a> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%280%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x(0)" class="latex" />, but chemists call it the <b>stoichiometric compatibility class</b> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%280%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x(0)." class="latex" /> </p>
<p>Anyway: what&#8217;s the deficiency of the reaction complex in our example?  It&#8217;s </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=5+-+2+-+3+%3D+0++&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="5 - 2 - 3 = 0  " class="latex" /></p>
<p>since there are 5 complexes, 2 connected components and the dimension of the stoichiometric subspace is 3.   </p>
<p>But what&#8217;s the deficiency zero theorem?  You&#8217;re almost ready for it.  You just need to know <i>one</i> more piece of jargon!  A reaction network is <b>weakly reversible</b> if whenever there&#8217;s a reaction going from a complex <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> to a complex <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y" class="latex" />, there&#8217;s a path of reactions going back from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" />.  Here the paths need to follow the arrows.</p>
<p>So, this reaction network is <i>not</i> weakly reversible:</p>
<div align="center"><img width="200" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/chemical_reaction_network_part_17_I.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>since we can get from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+%2B+C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A + C" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="D" class="latex" /> but not back from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="D" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+%2B+C%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A + C," class="latex" /> and from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B%2BE&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B+E" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="D" class="latex" /> but not back, and so on.  However, the network becomes weakly reversible if we add a reaction going back from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="D" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B+%2B+E&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B + E" class="latex" />:</p>
<div align="center"><img width="200" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/chemical_reaction_network_part_17_II.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>If a reaction network isn&#8217;t weakly reversible, one complex can  turn into another, but not vice versa.  In this situation, what typically happens is that as time goes on we have less and less of one species.  We could have an equilibrium where there&#8217;s <i>none</i> of this species.  But we have little right to expect an equilibrium solution of the rate equation that&#8217;s <b>positive</b>, meaning that it sits at a point <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%5Cin+%280%2C%5Cinfty%29%5ES&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x &#92;in (0,&#92;infty)^S" class="latex" />, where there&#8217;s a nonzero amount of every species.  </p>
<p>My argument here is not watertight: you&#8217;ll note that I fudged the difference between species and complexes.   But it can be made so when our reaction network has deficiency zero:</p>
<p><b>Deficiency Zero Theorem (Feinberg).</b>  Suppose we are given a reaction network with a finite set of species <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S" class="latex" />, and suppose its deficiency is zero.  Then: </p>
<p>(i) If the network is not weakly reversible and the rate constants are positive, the rate equation does not have a positive equilibrium solution.</p>
<p>(ii) If the network is not weakly reversible and the rate constants are positive, the rate equation does not have a positive periodic solution, that is, a periodic solution lying in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%280%2C%5Cinfty%29%5ES&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(0,&#92;infty)^S" class="latex" />. </p>
<p>(iii) If the network is weakly reversible and the rate constants are positive, the rate equation has exactly one equilibrium solution in each positive stoichiometric compatibility class.<br />
Any sufficiently nearby solution that starts in the same stoichiometric compatibility class will approach this equilibrium as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t+%5Cto+%2B%5Cinfty&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="t &#92;to +&#92;infty" class="latex" />.   Furthermore, there are no other positive periodic solutions.</p>
<p>This is quite an impressive result.  We&#8217;ll look at an easy example next time.</p>
<h4> References and remarks </h4>

<p>At first glance the deficiency zero theorem might seem to settle all the basic questions about the dynamics of reaction networks, or stochastic Petri nets&#8230; but actually, it just means that deficiency zero reaction networks don&#8217;t display very interesting dynamics in the limit as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t+%5Cto+%2B%5Cinfty.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="t &#92;to +&#92;infty." class="latex" />  So, to get more interesting behavior, we need to look at reaction networks that don&#8217;t have deficiency zero.  </p>
<p>For example, in biology it&#8217;s interesting to think about &#8216;bistable&#8217; chemical reactions: reactions that have two stable equilibria.  An electrical switch of the usual sort is a bistable system: it has stable &#8216;on&#8217; and &#8216;off&#8217; positions.  A bistable chemical reaction can serve as a kind of biological switch:</p>

<p>It&#8217;s also interesting to think about chemical reactions with stable periodic solutions.  Such a reaction can serve as a biological clock:</p>

					<p><i>guest post by <b><a href="http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~tl/">Tom Leinster</a></b></i></p>
<p>Even if there weren&#8217;t a <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Biodiversity">global biodiversity crisis</a>, we&#8217;d  want to know how to put a number on biodiversity. As Lord Kelvin famously put it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers, you know something about it; but when you cannot measure it, your knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind: it may be the beginning of knowledge, but you have scarcely, in your thoughts, advanced to the stage of <i>science</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this post, I&#8217;ll talk about what happens when you take a mass of biological data and try to turn it into a single <i>number</i>, intended to measure biodiversity.</p>
<p>There have been more than 50 years of debate about how to measure diversity.  While the idea of putting a number on biological diversity goes back to the 1940s at least, the debate really seems to have got going in the wake of  pioneering work by the great ecologist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Whittaker">Robert Whittaker</a> in the 1960s.</p>
<p>There followed several decades in which progress was made&#8230; but there was a lot of talking at cross-purposes. In fact, there was so much confusion that some people gave up on the diversity concept altogether. The mood is summed up by the title of an excellent and much-cited paper of <a href="http://www.bio.sdsu.edu/pub/stuart/stuart.html">Stuart Hurlbert</a>:</p>
<p>&bull; S. H. Hurlbert, The nonconcept of species diversity: A critique and alternative parameters. <i>Ecology</i> <b>52</b>:577&ndash;586, 1971.</p>
<p>So why all the confusion?</p>
<p>One reason is that the word &#8220;diversity&#8221; is used by different people in many different ways.  We all know that diversity is important: so if you found a quantity that seemed to measure biological variation in a sensible way, you might be tempted to call it &#8220;diversity&#8221; and publish a paper promoting your quantity over all other quantities that have ever been given that name.  There are literally dozens of measures of diversity in the literature.  Here are two simple ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Species richness</i> is simply the number of species in the community concerned.
</li>
<li>
The <i>Shannon entropy</i> is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=-%5Csum_%7Bi+%3D+1%7D%5ES+p_i+%5Clog%28p_i%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="-&#92;sum_{i = 1}^S p_i &#92;log(p_i)" class="latex" />, where our community consists of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S" class="latex" /> species in proportions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_1%2C+%5Cldots%2C+p_S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p_1, &#92;ldots, p_S" class="latex" />.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Which quantity should we call &#8220;diversity&#8221;?  Do all these quantities really measure the same kind of thing?  If community A has greater than species richness than community B, but lower Shannon entropy, what does it <i>mean</i>?</p>
<p>Another cause for confusion is a blurring between the questions</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Which quantities deserve to be called diversity?</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Which quantities are we capable of measuring experimentally?</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, we might all agree that species richness is an important quantity, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that species richness is easy to measure in practice.  (In fact, it&#8217;s not, more on which below.)  My own view is that the two questions should be kept separate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The statistical problem of designing appropriate estimators becomes relevant only after the measure to be estimated is accepted to be meaningful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Hans-Rolf Gregorius, Elizabeth M. Gillet, Generalized Simpson-diversity, <i>Ecological Modelling</i> <b>211</b>:90&ndash;96, 2008.)</p>
<p>The problems involved in quantifying diversity are of three types: <b>practical</b>, <b>statistical</b> and <b>conceptual</b>. I&#8217;ll say a little about the first two, and rather more about the third.</p>
<p><b>Practical</b>&nbsp; Suppose that you&#8217;re doing a survey of the vertebrates in a forest.  Perhaps one important species is brightly coloured and noisy, while another is silent, shy, and well-camouflaged.  How do you prevent the first from being recorded disproportionately?</p>
<p>Or suppose that you&#8217;re carrying out a survey, with multiple people doing the fieldwork.  Different people have a tendency to spot different things: for example, one person might be short-sighted and another long-sighted.  How do you ensure that this doesn&#8217;t affect your results?</p>
<p><b>Statistical</b>&nbsp; Imagine that you want to know how many distinct species of insect live in a particular area &mdash; the &#8220;species richness&#8221;, in the terminology introduced above.  You go out collecting, and you come back with 100 specimens representing 10 species.</p>
<p>But your survey might have missed some species altogether, so you go out and get a bigger sample.  This time, you get 200 specimens representing 15 species.  Does this help you discover how many species there <i>really</i> are?  </p>
<p>Logically, not at all.  The only certainty is that there are at least 15 species.  Maybe there are thousands of species, but almost all of them are extremely rare.  Or maybe there are really only 15.  Unless you collect <i>all</i> the insects, you&#8217;ll never know for sure exactly how many species there are.</p>
<p>However, it may be that you can make reasonable assumptions about the frequency distribution of the species.  People sometimes do exactly this, to try to overcome the difficulty of estimating species richness.</p>
<p><b>Conceptual</b>&nbsp; This is what I really want to talk about.</p>
<p>I mentioned earlier that different people mean different things by &#8220;diversity&#8221;.  Here&#8217;s an example. </p>
<p>Consider two bird communities.  The first looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~tl/birds_top.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>It contains four species, one of which is responsible for most of the population, and three of which are quite rare.  The second looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~tl/birds_bottom.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>It has only three species, but they&#8217;re evenly balanced.</p>
<p>Which community is the more diverse?  It&#8217;s a matter of opinion. Mostly in the press, and in many scholarly articles too, &#8220;biodiversity&#8221; is used as a synonym for &#8220;species richness&#8221;.  On this count, the first community is more diverse.  But if you&#8217;re more concerned with the healthy functioning of the whole community, the presence of rare species might not be particularly important: it&#8217;s <i>balance</i> that matters, and the second community has more of that.</p>
<p>Different people using the word &#8220;diversity&#8221; attach different amounts of significance to rare species.  There&#8217;s a spectrum of points of view, ranging from those who give rare species the same weight as common ones (as in the definition of species richness) to those who are only interested in the most common species of all.  Every point on this spectrum of viewpoints is reasonable.  None should have a monopoly on the word &#8220;diversity&#8221;. </p>
<p>At least, that&#8217;s what <a href="http://www.maths.gla.ac.uk/~cc">Christina Cobbold</a> and I argue in our new paper:</p>
<p>&bull; Tom Leinster, Christina A. Cobbold, <a href="http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~tl/mdiss.pdf">Measuring diversity: the importance of species similarity</a>, <i>Ecology</i>, in press (<a href="http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/10-2402.1">doi:10.1890/10-2402.1</a>).</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not actually our main point.  As the title suggests, the real purpose of our paper is to show how to measure diversity in a way that reflects <i>the varying differences between species</i>.  I&#8217;ll explain. </p>
<p>Most of the existing approaches to measuring biodiversity go like this.</p>
<p>We have a &#8220;community&#8221; of organisms &mdash; the fish in a lake, the fungi in a forest, or the bacteria on your skin.  This community is divided into <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S" class="latex" /> groups, conventionally called <b>species</b>, though they needn&#8217;t be species in the ordinary sense.</p>
<p>We assume that we know the <b>relative abundances</b>, or relative frequencies, of the species.  Write them as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_1%2C+%5Cldots%2C+p_S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p_1, &#92;ldots, p_S" class="latex" />.  Thus, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p_i" class="latex" /> is the proportion of the total population that belongs to the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i" class="latex" />th species, where &#8220;proportion&#8221; is measured in any way you think sensible (number of individuals, total mass, etc).</p>
<p>We only care about <i>relative</i> abundances here, not <i>absolute</i> abundances: so <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_1+%2B+%5Ccdots+%2B+p_S+%3D+1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p_1 + &#92;cdots + p_S = 1" class="latex" />. If half of a forest is destroyed, it might be a catastrophe, but on the (unrealistic) assumption that all the flora and fauna in the forest were distributed homogeneously, it won&#8217;t actually change the biodiversity.  (That&#8217;s not a statement about what&#8217;s important in life; it&#8217;s only a statement about the usage of a word.)  </p>
<p>This model is common but crude.  It can&#8217;t detect the difference between a community of six dramatically different species and a community consisting of six species of barnacle.</p>
<p>So, Christina and I use a refined model, as follows.  We assume that we also have a measure of the <b>similarity</b> between each pair of species.  This is a real number between 0 and 1, with 0 indicating that the species are as dissimilar as could be, and 1 indicating that they&#8217;re identical.  Writing the similarity between the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i" class="latex" />th and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="j" class="latex" />th species as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z_%7Bij%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Z_{ij}" class="latex" />, this gives an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S+%5Ctimes+S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S &#92;times S" class="latex" /> matrix <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbf%7BZ%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbf{Z}" class="latex" />.  Our only assumption on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbf%7BZ%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbf{Z}" class="latex" /> is that its diagonal entries are all 1: every species is identical to itself.</p>
<p>There are many ways of measuring inter-species similarity. Probably the most familiar approach is genetic, as in &#8220;you share 98% of your DNA with a chimpanzee&#8221;.  But there are many other possibilities: functional, phylogenetic, morphological, taxonomic, &#8230;.  Diversity is a measure of the variety of life; having to choose a measure of similarity forces you to get clear exactly what you mean by &#8220;variety&#8221;.</p>
<p>Christina and I are by no means the first people to incorporate species similarity into the model of an ecological community.  The main new thing in our paper is this measure of the community&#8217;s diversity:</p>

In both places, you&#8217;ll also find an explanation of what motivates this formula.  What&#8217;s more, you&#8217;ll see that many existing measures of diversity are special cases of ours, obtained by taking particular values for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="q" class="latex" /> and/or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbf%7BZ%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbf{Z}" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>But I won&#8217;t talk about any of that here.  Instead, I&#8217;ll tell you  how taking species similarity into account can radically alter the assessment of diversity.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll do this using an example: butterflies of subfamily Charaxinae at a site in an Ecuadorian rainforest. The data is from here:</p>
<p>&bull; P. J. DeVries, D. Murray, R. Lande, Species diversity in vertical, horizontal and temporal dimensions of a fruit-feeding butterfly community in an Ecuadorian rainforest.  <i>Biological Journal of the Linnean Society</i> <b>62</b>:343&ndash;364, 1997.</p>
<p>They measured the butterfly abundances in both the canopy (top level) and understorey (lower level) at this site, with the following results:</p>
<table cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td><b>Species</b></td>
<td><b>Canopy&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></td>
<td><b>Understorey</b></td>

<td>32</td>

</table>
<p>Which is more diverse: canopy or understorey?</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve already seen that the answer is going to depend on what exactly we mean by &#8220;diverse&#8221;.</p>
<p>First let&#8217;s answer the question under the (crude!) assumption that different species have nothing whatsoever in common.  This means taking our similarity matrix <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbf%7BZ%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbf{Z}" class="latex" /> to be the identity matrix: if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i+%5Cneq+j&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i &#92;neq j" class="latex" /> then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z_%7Bij%7D+%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Z_{ij} = 0" class="latex" /> (totally dissimilar), and if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i+%3D+j&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i = j" class="latex" /> then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z_%7Bii%7D+%3D+1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Z_{ii} = 1" class="latex" /> (totally identical).</p>
<p>Now, remember that there&#8217;s a spectrum of viewpoints on how much importance to give to rare species when measuring diversity. Rather than choosing a particular viewpoint, we&#8217;ll calculate the diversity from <i>all</i> viewpoints, and display it on a graph. In other words, we&#8217;ll draw the graph of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7D%5Eq+D%5E%7B%5Cmathbf%7BZ%7D%7D%28%5Cmathbf%7Bp%7D%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{}^q D^{&#92;mathbf{Z}}(&#92;mathbf{p})" class="latex" /> (the diversity of order <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="q" class="latex" />) against <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="q" class="latex" /> (the viewpoint).  Here&#8217;s what we get:</p>
<p><img width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~tl/naive_bflies.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>(the horizontal axis should be labelled with a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="q" class="latex" />.)</p>
<p>Conclusion: from <i>all</i> viewpoints, the butterfly population in the canopy is at least as diverse as that in the understorey.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s do it again, but this time taking account of the varying <i>similarities</i> between species of butterflies.  We don&#8217;t have much to go on: how do we know whether <i>Prepona laertes</i> is very similar to, or very different from, <i>Archaeoprepona demophon</i>?   With only the data above, we don&#8217;t.  So what can we do?</p>
<p>All we have to go on is the taxonomy.  Remember your high school biology: for the butterfly <i>Prepona laertes</i>, the genus is <i>Prepona</i> and the species is <i>laertes</i>.  We&#8217;d expect species in the same genus to have more in common than species in different genera.  So let&#8217;s define the similarity between two species as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
the similarity is 1 if the species are the same
</li>
<li>
the similarity is 0.5 if the species are different but in the same genus
</li>
<li>
the similarity is 0 if they are not even in the same genus.
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is still crude, but in the absence of further information, it&#8217;s about the best we can do.  And it&#8217;s better than the first approach, where we ignored the taxonomy entirely.  Throwing away biologically relevant information is unlikely to lead to a better assessment of diversity.</p>
<p>Using this taxonomic matrix <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbf%7BZ%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbf{Z}" class="latex" />, and the same abundances, the diversity graphs become:</p>
<p><img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~tl/taxo_bflies.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>This is more interesting!  For <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q+%3E+1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="q &gt; 1" class="latex" />, the understorey looks <i>more</i> diverse than the canopy &mdash; the opposite conclusion to our first approach.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not hard to see why.  Look again at the table of abundances, but paying attention to the <i>genera</i> of the butterflies.  In the canopy, nearly three-quarters of the butterflies are of genus <i>Memphis</i>.  So when we take into account the fact that species in the same genus tend to be somewhat similar, the canopy looks much less diverse than it did before.  In the understorey, however, the species are spread more evenly between genera, so taking similarity into account leaves its diversity relatively unchanged.</p>
<p>Taking account of species similarity opens up a world of uncertainty.  How should we measure similarity?  There are as many possibilities as there are quantifiable characteristics of living organisms.  It&#8217;s much more reassuring to stay in the black-and-white world where distinct species are always assigned a similarity of 0, no matter how similar they might actually be.  (This is, effectively, what most existing measures do.)  But that&#8217;s just hiding from reality. </p>
<p>Maybe you disagree!  If so, try the the Discussion section of our <a href="http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~tl/mdiss.pdf">paper</a>, where we lay out our arguments in more detail.  Or let me know by leaving a comment.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>The changes we&#8217;re starting to go through now are so big that we need to step back and take a very long view to get any sort of handle on them.   I&#8217;m struggling to do this now.  This book has been very helpful:</p>
<p>&bull;  Tim Lenton and Andrew Watson, <i>Revolutions That Made the Earth</i>, Oxford U. Press, Oxford, 2011.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot in it, and I&#8217;d love to tell you about all of it&#8230; but for now, let me just list 8 major transitions life on Earth may have gone through:</p>
<p><b>1. Compartments.</b>  This transition takes us from self-replicating molecules to self-replicating molecules in &#8216;compartments&#8217;&#8212;membranes of some sort.  A compartment separates &#8216;self&#8217; from &#8216;other&#8217;, and it&#8217;s crucial to life as we know it.  When did this transition happen?  Certainly after 4.4 billion years ago, when the Earth first got a solid crust.  Probably after 3.85 billion years ago, when the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Heavy_Bombardment">Late Heavy Bombardment</a> ended.  Certainly before 3.3 billion years ago, when the earliest well-established microfossils are found.  Probably before 3.8 billion years ago, which is the age of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isua_greenstone_belt">Isua greenstone belt</a>&#8212;a formation that contains graphite specks with less carbon-13 than average, a hint of life.</p>
<p><b>2.  Groups of genes.</b>  This transition takes us from independent self-replicating molecules to self-replicating molecules linked into long chains, probably RNA.  When did this happen?  I have no idea; I&#8217;m not sure anyone does. Probably sometime between 4.4 and 3.3 billion years ago!</p>
<p><b>3. Genetic code.</b> This transition takes us from a world where RNA both stored information and catalyzed reactions to a world where DNA stores the information used to build for proteins, which catalyze reactions.   When did this happen?  Again, probably sometime between 4.4 and 3.3 billion years ago!</p>
<p><b>4.  Eukaryotes.</b>  This transition takes us from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prokaryote">prokaryotes</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote">eukaryotes</a>.  Prokaryotes, like bacteria and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaea">archaea</a>, have relatively simple cells, like this:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prokaryote"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Average_prokaryote_cell-_en.svg/300px-Average_prokaryote_cell-_en.svg.png" /></a></div>
<p>Eukaryotes&#8212;like animals, plants, fungi and protists&#8212;have cells with lots of internal parts called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organelle">organelles</a>.  Here are some things you might see in a eukaryotic cell:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://www.protopage.com/rachelb.group"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/images.protopage.com/view/721453/2x6o0oeafqbbm02osrk87g5go.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>It&#8217;s now believed some organelles were originally independent prokaryotes that got swallowed up but survived as symbiotic partners: so-called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endosymbiotic_theory">endosymbionts</a>.  The evidence is especially good for mitochondria and chloroplasts, which have their own DNA.  When did this transition occur?  Some experts say around 1.85 billion years ago.  Nick Butterfield has seen fossils of red algae dating back to 1.2 billion years ago, so eukaryotes were definitely around by then.  The authors of this book date eukaryotes to &#8220;roughly 2 billion years ago, give or take 0.5 billion years.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>5. Sex. </b>  This transition takes us from populations of asexually reproducing clones to populations that reproduce sexually.  When did this happen?  Roughly around the time eukaryotes arose.  The authors write:</p>
<blockquote><p> We would like to know if the evolution of sex is really separate from the evolution of eukaryotes, or whether the two are so closely related that sex co-evolved with the eukaryotic cell.  It would help if we knew precisely why organisms bother with sex, but we don&#8217;t.
</p></blockquote>
<p><b>6.  Cell differentiation. </b>  This transition takes us from single-celled protists to multi-celled animals, plants and fungi where different cells specialize to play different roles.  When did this happen?  The oldest known animal fossils are some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal#Origin_and_fossil_record">early sponges in the Trezona Formation</a> in South Australia&#8230; they go back 665 million years.  Plants may go back <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_history_of_plants">1.2 billion years</a>, and fungi perhaps around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_fungi">1.4 billion years</a>.    Just for fun, here&#8217;s a typical plant cell:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_cell"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Plant_cell_structure_svg.svg/450px-Plant_cell_structure_svg.svg.png" /></a></div>
<p>but of course the point is that thanks to differentiation, different cells in the organism look different!</p>
<p><b>7.  Social colonies. </b> This transition takes us from solitary individuals to social organizations such as colonies of ants, bees and termites, or the somewhat different societies of birds and mammals.  Sociality has arisen independently many times, but it&#8217;s hard to say when because it&#8217;s hard to find fossil evidence!  In the early Triassic, about 250 million years ago, we find fossilized burrows containing up to twenty <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynodont">cynodonts</a> of a type known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trirachodon"><i>Trirachodon</i></a>:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trirachodon"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Trirachodon.jpg/320px-Trirachodon.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>Cynodonts are classified as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapsid">synapsids</a>, a group of animals that includes mammals but also &#8216;proto-mammals&#8217; like these.  By the late Triassic, there&#8217;s also evidence for social behavior among termites.  It would be funny if proto-mammals beat the insects to sociality.  I bet the insects got there first: the fossil record is not always complete!</p>
<p><b>8.  Language.</b>  This is the transition from societies without language (for example, earlier primates) to societies with (for example, us).   When did this happen?  Alas, it&#8217;s even harder to read off the beginning of language from the fossil record than the arrival of social behavior!  I&#8217;ll just quote <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language#Origin">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Some scholars assume the development of primitive language-like systems (proto-language) as early as <i>Homo habilis</i>, while others place the development of primitive symbolic communication only with <i>Homo erectus</i> (1.8 million years ago) or <i>Homo heidelbergensis</i> (0.6 million years ago) and the development of language proper with <i>Homo sapiens sapiens</i> less than 100,000 years ago.
</p></blockquote>
<p>So that&#8217;s a list of 8 &#8216;major transitions&#8217;!   With each one we get a higher level of organization, while preserving the structures that came before.  At least that&#8217;s true of the first 7: the last is a work in progress.</p>
<p>In fact, this list was first propounded here:</p>
<p>&bull; E&ouml;rs Szathm&aacute;ry and John Maynard Smith, <a href="http://joelvelasco.net/teaching/167win10/szathmary%20and%20maynard%20smith%2095-major%20evo%20transitions.pdf">The major evolutionary transitions</a>, <i>Nature</i> <b>374</b> (1995), 227-232.</p>
<p>and these authors expanded on their ideas here:</p>
<p>&bull; E&ouml;rs Szathm&aacute;ry and John Maynard Smith, <i>The Major Transitions in Evolution</i>, Oxford U. Press, Oxford, 1995.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t read that book yet, alas.  Lenton and Watson actually argue for a different, shorter list:</p>
<p><b>1.  The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis">origin of life</a>, before 3.8 billion years ago.</b></p>
<p><b>2.  The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Oxygenation_Event">Great Oxidation</a>, when photosynthesis put oxygen into the atmosphere between 3.4 and 2.5 billion years ago. </b></p>
<p><b>3.  The rise of complex life (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote">eukaryotes</a>), roughly 2 billion years ago. </b></p>
<p><b>4.  The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recent_African_origin_of_modern_humans">rise of humanity</a>, roughly 0 billion years ago.</b></p>
<p>They consider these to be the &#8220;truly difficult events that may have determined the pace of evolution&#8221;.</p>
<p>Of course the latest revolution, <i>humanity</i>, is not complete.  There is no guarantee that it will have a happy ending.  Lenton and Watson sketch several alternative futures:</p>
<p><b>1. Apocalypse.</b> </p>
<p><b>2.  Retreat.</b></p>
<p><b>3.  Revolution.</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll say more about these later.  This is what Azimuth is ultimately all about.  </p>

				<h2><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/09/17/the-malay-archipelago/" rel="bookmark">The Malay Archipelago</a></h2>
				<small>17 September, 2011</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>I live on the fringes of the Malay Archipelago.  At least that&#8217;s what the naturalist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Russel_Wallace">Alfred Russel Wallace</a> called it.  In his famous book of that name, he wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The Malay Archipelago extends for more than 4,000 miles in length from east to west, and is about 1,300 in breadth from north to south.  It would stretch over an expanse equal to that of all Europe from the extreme west far into Central Asia, or would cover the widest parts of South America, and extend far beyond the land into the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.  It includes three islands larger than Great Britain; and in one of them, Borneo, the whole of the British Isles might be set down, and would be surrounded by a sea of forests.  New Guinea, though less compact in shape, is probably larger than Borneo.  Sumatra is about equal in extent to Great Britain; Java, Luzon and Celebes are each about the size of Ireland.  Eighteen more islands are, on the average, as large as Jamaica; more than a hundred are larger than the Isle of Wight; while the isles and islets of smaller size are innumerable. </p></blockquote>
<p>Wallace claimed to have fond a line running through the Malay Archipelago that separates islands with Asian flora and fauna from those with plants and animals more like those of Austalia.  This is now called the &#8216;Wallace Line&#8217;.  It runs between Bali (on the western, Asiatic side) and the lesser-known nearby island of Lombok (on the eastern side).  </p>
<p>Why does the Wallace Line run right between these two nearby islands?  Wallace had a theory: it&#8217;s because the ocean between them is very deep!  Even when sea levels were much lower&#8212;for example during the last ice age&#8212;and many islands were connected by land bridges, Bali and Lombok remained separate.  Indeed, all the islands on one side of the Wallace Line have been separate from those on the other side for a very, very long time.</p>
<p>How long?  Maybe forever, since Australia used to be down near Antarctica.  I don&#8217;t really know.  Do you?  I&#8217;ve brought Wallace&#8217;s book to read with me, but that&#8217;s probably not the best way to find out.  It should be easy to look up.</p>
<p>However, everything gets more complicated when you examine it carefully.  Now the Wallace Line is just one of several important lines dividing biogeographical regions in the Malay Archipelago:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="450" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Map_of_Sunda_and_Sahul.png" />
</div>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundaland">Sundaland</a> is the land shelf containing the Malay Peninsula, Borneo, Java, and Sumatra.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_%28continent%29">Sahul</a>, also known as Australasia or simply Australia, is the land shelf containing Australia and New Guinea.   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallacea">Wallacea</a> is a group of islands between Sundaland and Sahul&#8212;islands that haven&#8217;t been haven&#8217;t been recently connected to <i>either</i> of these land shelves.</p>
<p>The Wallace line is the western boundary of Wallacea, separating it from Sundaland.  The Lydekker line, named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Lydekker">Richard Lydekker</a>, is the eastern boundary of Wallacea separating it, from Sahul.</p>
<p>Wallacea is the red, heart-shaped region here:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="450" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Indonesia_Wallacea.svg/450px-Indonesia_Wallacea.svg.png" />
</div>
<p>The blue line through Wallacea is called the &#8216;Weber line&#8217;.    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Carl_Wilhelm_Weber">Max Carl Wilhelm Weber</a> argued that this line, not the boundary between Bali and Lombok, mark the major boundary between Asiatic and Australian organisms. </p>
<p>I bet the real truth is even more complicated.</p>
<p>Anyway, today my wife and I are going to Lombok.  We&#8217;ll say there until the 21st, based in Senggigi; then we&#8217;ll go to Bali and stay in the town of Ubud until the 25th.  So, we&#8217;ll have a good chance to see the difference between Asiatic and Wallacean flora and fauna.  </p>

				<h2><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/09/12/fools-gold/" rel="bookmark">Fool&#8217;s Gold</a></h2>
				<small>12 September, 2011</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>My favorite Platonic solids are the regular dodecahedron, with 12 faces and 20 corners:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodecahedron"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/dodecahedron/Dodecahedron.gif" /></a></div>
<p>and the regular icosahedron, with 12 corners and 20 faces:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icosahedron"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/dodecahedron/Icosahedron.gif" /></a>
</div>
<p>They are close relatives, with all the same symmetries&#8230; but what excites me most is that they have <i>5-fold</i> symmetry.  It&#8217;s a theorem that no crystal can have 5-fold symmetry.  So, we might wonder whether these shapes occur in nature&#8230; and if they don&#8217;t, how people dreamt up these shapes in the first place.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s widely believed that the Pythagoreans dreamt up the regular dodecahedron after seeing crystals of iron pyrite&mdash;the mineral also known as &#8216;fool&#8217;s gold&#8217;.  Nobody has any proof of this.  However, there were a lot of Pythagoreans in Sicily back around 500 BC, and also a lot of pyrite.  And, it&#8217;s fairly common for pyrite to form crystals like this:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://www.minerals.net/mineral/pyrite.aspx"><br />
<img src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/dodecahedron/pyrite.jpg" /></a>
</div>
<p>This crystal is a &#8216;pyritohedron&#8217;.  It looks <i>similar</i> to regular dodecahedron&#8212;but it&#8217;s not!  At the molecular level, iron pyrite has little crystal cells with cubic symmetry.  But these cubes can form a pyritohedron:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/symmetry/isometuc.htm"><br />
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/dodecahedron/pyritohedron.gif" alt="" /></a></div>
<p>(By the way, you can click on any of these pictures for more information.)</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll notice that the front face of this pyritohedron is like a staircase with steps that go up 2 cubes for each step forwards.   In other words, it&#8217;s a staircase with slope 2.  That&#8217;s the key to the math here!  By definition, the <b>pyritohedron</b> has faces formed by planes at right angles to these 12 vectors:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Bcccc%7D+%282%2C1%2C0%29+%26++%282%2C-1%2C0%29+%26++%28-2%2C1%2C0%29+%26++%28-2%2C-1%2C0%29+%5C%5C+%281%2C0%2C2%29+%26++%28-1%2C0%2C2%29+%26++%281%2C0%2C-2%29+%26++%28-1%2C0%2C-2%29+%5C%5C+%280%2C2%2C1%29+%26++%280%2C2%2C-1%29+%26++%280%2C-2%2C1%29+%26++%280%2C-2%2C-1%29+%5C%5C+%5Cend%7Barray%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;begin{array}{cccc} (2,1,0) &amp;  (2,-1,0) &amp;  (-2,1,0) &amp;  (-2,-1,0) &#92;&#92; (1,0,2) &amp;  (-1,0,2) &amp;  (1,0,-2) &amp;  (-1,0,-2) &#92;&#92; (0,2,1) &amp;  (0,2,-1) &amp;  (0,-2,1) &amp;  (0,-2,-1) &#92;&#92; &#92;end{array} " class="latex" />
</div>
<p>On the other hand, a regular dodecahedron has faces formed by the planes at right angles to some very similar vectors, where the number 2 has been replaced by this number, called the <b>golden ratio</b>:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%7B%5CPhi+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B%5Csqrt%7B5%7D+%2B+1%7D%7B2%7D%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle {&#92;Phi = &#92;frac{&#92;sqrt{5} + 1}{2}} " class="latex" />
</div>
<p>Namely, these vectors:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Bcccc%7D+%28%5CPhi%2C1%2C0%29+%26++%28%5CPhi%2C-1%2C0%29+%26++%28-%5CPhi%2C1%2C0%29+%26++%28-%5CPhi%2C-1%2C0%29+%5C%5C+%281%2C0%2C%5CPhi%29+%26++%28-1%2C0%2C%5CPhi%29+%26++%281%2C0%2C-%5CPhi%29+%26++%28-1%2C0%2C-%5CPhi%29+%5C%5C+%280%2C%5CPhi%2C1%29+%26++%280%2C%5CPhi%2C-1%29+%26++%280%2C-%5CPhi%2C1%29+%26++%280%2C-%5CPhi%2C-1%29+%5C%5C+%5Cend%7Barray%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;begin{array}{cccc} (&#92;Phi,1,0) &amp;  (&#92;Phi,-1,0) &amp;  (-&#92;Phi,1,0) &amp;  (-&#92;Phi,-1,0) &#92;&#92; (1,0,&#92;Phi) &amp;  (-1,0,&#92;Phi) &amp;  (1,0,-&#92;Phi) &amp;  (-1,0,-&#92;Phi) &#92;&#92; (0,&#92;Phi,1) &amp;  (0,&#92;Phi,-1) &amp;  (0,-&#92;Phi,1) &amp;  (0,-&#92;Phi,-1) &#92;&#92; &#92;end{array} " class="latex" />
</div>
<p>Since </p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CPhi+%5Capprox+1.618...+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;Phi &#92;approx 1.618... " class="latex" />
</div>
<p>the golden ratio is not <i>terribly</i> far from 2.  So, the pyritohedron is a passable attempt at a regular dodecahedron.  Perhaps it was even good enough to trick the Pythagoreans into inventing the real thing.</p>
<p>If so, we can say: <i><b>fool&#8217;s gold made a fool&#8217;s golden ratio good enough to fool the Greeks.</b></i></p>
<p>At this point I can&#8217;t resist a digression.   You get the Fibonacci numbers by starting with two 1&#8217;s and then generating a list of numbers where each is the sum of the previous two:</p>
<div align="center">
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, &#8230;
</div>
<p>The ratios of consecutive Fibonacci numbers get closer and closer to the golden ratio.  For example:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Bccl%7D++1%2F1+%26%3D%26+1+%5C%5C+2%2F1+%26%3D%26+2++%5C%5C+3%2F2+%26%3D%26+1.5+++%5C%5C++5%2F3+%26%3D%26+1.6666..+++%5C%5C+8%2F5+%26%3D%26+1.6+%5C%5C+%5Cend%7Barray%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;begin{array}{ccl}  1/1 &amp;=&amp; 1 &#92;&#92; 2/1 &amp;=&amp; 2  &#92;&#92; 3/2 &amp;=&amp; 1.5   &#92;&#92;  5/3 &amp;=&amp; 1.6666..   &#92;&#92; 8/5 &amp;=&amp; 1.6 &#92;&#92; &#92;end{array} " class="latex" />
</div>
<p>and so on.  So, in theory, we could use these ratios to make cubical crystals that come closer and closer to a regular dodecahedron!</p>
<p>And in fact, pyrite doesn&#8217;t just form the 2/1 pyritohedron I showed you earlier.  Sometimes it forms a 3/2 pyritohedron!  This is noticeably better.  The 2/1 version looks like this:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://www.iucr.org/education/pamphlets/12/graphical-index/figures/individual?show=14180"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/dodecahedron/pyritohedron-2-1_IUCr.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>while the 3/2 version looks like this:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://www.iucr.org/education/pamphlets/12/graphical-index/figures/individual?show=14180"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/dodecahedron/pyritohedron-3-2_IUCr.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>Has anyone ever seen a 5/3 pyritohedron?  That would be even better.  It would be quite hard to distinguish by eye from a true regular dodecahedron.  Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t think iron pyrite forms such subtle crystals.</p>
<p>Okay.  End of digression.  But there&#8217;s another trick we can play!  </p>

<p>besides being at right angles to the <i>faces</i> of the <i>dodecahedron</i>, are also the <i>corners</i> of the <i>icosahedron!</i></p>
<p>And if we use the number 2 here instead of the number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CPhi&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;Phi" class="latex" />, we get the vertices of a so-called <b>pseudoicosahedron</b>.  Again, this can be made out of cubes:</p>
<div align="center">

<img src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/pseudoicosahedron.gif" alt="" /><br />
</a></div>
<p>However, nobody seems to think the Greeks ever saw a crystal shaped like a pseudoicosahedron!  The icosahedron is first mentioned in Book XIII of Euclid&#8217;s <i>Elements</i>, which speaks of:</p>
<blockquote><p>
the five so-called Platonic figures which, however, do not belong to Plato, three of the five being due to the Pythagoreans, namely the cube, the pyramid, and the dodecahedron, while the octahedron and the icosahedron are due to Theaetetus.
</p></blockquote>
<p>So, maybe <a href="http://www.gap-system.org/~history/Biographies/Theaetetus.html">Theaetetus</a> discovered the icosahedron.  Indeed, <a href="http://www.ams.org/bull/2006-43-02/S0273-0979-06-01111-6/">Benno Artmann</a> has argued that this shape was the first mathematical object that was a pure creation of human thought, not inspired by anything people saw!</p>
<p>That idea is controversial.  It leads to some fascinating puzzles, like: <i>did the Scots make stone balls shaped like Platonic solids back in 2000 BC?</i>  For more on these puzzles, try this:</p>
<p>&bull; John Baez, <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/icosahedron/">Who discovered the icosahedron?</a></p>
<p>But right now I want to head in another direction.  It turns out iron pyrite <i>can</i> form a crystal shaped like a pseudoicosahedron!  And as Johan Kjellman pointed out to me, one of these crystals was recently auctioned off&#8230; for only 47 dollars!  </p>
<p>It&#8217;s beautiful:</p>

<p>So: did the Greeks ever seen one of these?  Alas, we may never know.  </p>

<p>To wrap up, I should admit that icosahedra and dodecahedra show up in many other places in nature&#8212;but probably too small for the ancient Greeks to see.  Here are some sea creatures magnified 50 times:</p>

<p>The gray bar on top is 10 nanometers long, while the bar on bottom is just 5 nanometers long.</p>
<p>The mathematics of viruses with 5-fold symmetry is fascinating.  Just today, I learned of <a href="http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~rt507/">Reidun Twarock</a>&#8216;s recent discoveries in this area:</p>
<p>&bull; Reidun Twarock, <a href="http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/364/1849/3357.long">Mathematical virology: a novel approach to the structure and assembly of viruses</a>, <i>Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A</i> <b>364</b> (2006), 3357-3373.</p>
<p>Most viruses with 5-fold symmetry have protein shells in patterns based on the same math as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic_dome">geodesic domes</a>:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic_dome"><img width="200" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/G%C3%A9ode_V_3_1_duale.gif" alt="" />&nbsp; <img width="200" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/G%C3%A9ode_V_3_1.gif" /></a></div>
<p>But some more unusual viruses, like polyomavirus and simian virus 40, use more sophisticated patterns made of two kinds of tiles:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/364/1849/3357.short"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/dodecahedron/virus_twarock.jpg" alt="" /></a></div>
<p>They still have 5-fold symmetry, but these patterns are spherical versions of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_tiling">Penrose tilings</a>!  A Penrose tiling is a <i>nonrepeating</i> pattern, typically with <i>approximate</i> 5-fold symmetry, made out of two kinds of tiles:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_tiling"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Penrose_Tiling_%28Rhombi%29.svg/350px-Penrose_Tiling_%28Rhombi%29.svg.png" alt="" /></a></div>
<p>To understand these more unusual viruses, Twarock needed to use some very clever math:</p>
<p>&bull; Thomas Keef and Reidun Twarock, <a href="http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~tk506/KT2_FINAL.pdf">Affine extensions of the icosahedral group with applications to the three-dimensional organisation of simple viruses</a>, <i>J. Math. Biol.</i> <b></b> <b>59</b> (2009), 287-313.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s another story for another day!</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p><i>guest post by <b><a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Cameron+Smith">Cameron Smith</a></b></i></p>
<p>Consider these quotes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>My thesis has been that one path to the construction of a non-trivial theory of complex systems is by way of a theory of hierarchy. Empirically, a large proportion of the complex systems we observe in nature exhibit hierarchic structure. On theoretical grounds we could expect complex systems to be hierarchies in a world in which complexity had to evolve from simplicity.</i> &#8211; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Simon">Herbert Simon</a>, 1962
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>
<i>(Many of the concepts that) have dominated scientific thinking for three hundred years, are based upon the understanding that at smaller and smaller scales—both in space and in time—physical systems become simple, smooth and without detail. A more careful articulation of these ideas would note that the fine scale structure of planets, materials and atoms is not without detail. However, for many problems, such detail becomes irrelevant at the larger scale. Since the details (become) irrelevant (at such larger scales), formulating theories in a way that assumes that the detail does not exist yields the same results as (theories that do not make this assumption).</i> &#8211; <a href="http://www.necsi.edu/faculty/bar-yam.html">Yaneer Bar-Yam</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Thoughts like these lead me to believe that, as a whole, we humans need to reassess some of our approaches to understanding. I&#8217;m not opposed to reductionism, but I think it would be useful to try to characterize those situations that might require something more than an exclusively reductionist approach. One way to do that is to break down some barriers that we&#8217;ve constructed between <i>disciplines</i>.   So I&#8217;m here on Azimuth trying to help out this process.</p>
<p>Indeed, Azimuth is just one of many endeavors people are beginning to work on that might just lead to the unification of humanity into a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superorganism">superorganism</a>.  Regardless of the external reality, a fear of climate change could have a unifying effect.  And, if we humans are simply a set of constituents of the superorganism that is Earth&#8217;s biosphere, it appears we are its only candidate germ line. So, assuming we&#8217;d like our descendants to have a chance at existence in the universe, we need to figure out either how to keep this superorganism alive or help it reproduce.</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan#Pale_Blue_Dot:_A_Vision_of_the_Human_Future_in_Space_.281994.29" target="_blank"><img width="450" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/PaleBlueDot.jpg/400px-PaleBlueDot.jpg" alt="" /></a></div>
<p>We each have to recognize our own individual limitations of time, commitment, and brainpower.  So, I&#8217;m trying to limit my work to the study of biological evolution rather than conjuring up a &#8216;pet theory of everything&#8217;.   However, I&#8217;m also trying not to let those disciplinary and institutional barriers limit the tools I find valuable, or the people I interact with.  </p>
<p>So, the more I&#8217;ve thought about the complexity of evolution (for now let&#8217;s just say &#8216;complexity&#8217; = &#8216;anything humans don&#8217;t yet understand&#8217;), the more I&#8217;ve been driven to search for new languages.  And in that search, I&#8217;ve been driven toward pure mathematics, where there are many exciting languages lurking around. Perhaps one of these languages has already obviated the need to invent new ideas to understand biological evolution&#8230; or perhaps an altogether new language needs to be constructed.</p>
<p>The prospects of a general theory of evolution point to the same intellectual challenge that we see in the quote above from Bar-Yam: assuming we&#8217;d like to be able to consistently manipulate the universe, when can we neglect <i>details</i> and when can&#8217;t we? </p>
<p>Consider the <i>level of organization</i> concept.  Since different details of a system can be effectively ignored at different scales, our scientific theories have themselves become &#8216;stratified&#8217;:</p>
<p>&bull; G. L. Farre, The energetic structure of observation: a philosophical disquisition, <i><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0002764297040006004">American Behavioral Scientist</a></i> <b>40</b> (May 1997), 717-728.</p>
<p>In other words, science tends to be organized in &#8216;layers&#8217;.  These layers have come to be conceived of as levels of organization, and each scientific theory tends to address only one of these levels (click the image to see the flash animation that ascends through many scales or levels): </p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://primaxstudio.com/stuff/scale_of_universe/" target="_blank"><img width="450" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-SQKOaOMkK0M/Tjb_ipcJYEI/AAAAAAAAGWE/DnWrrs3OS60/s640/Scale%252520of%252520Universe.jpg" alt="" /></a></div>
<p>It might be useful to work explicitly on connecting theories that tell us about particular levels of organization in order to attempt to develop some theories that <i>transcend</i> levels of organization. One type of insight that could be gained from this approach is an understanding of the mutual development of bottom-up <i>ostensibly mechanistic</i> models of simple systems and top-down <i>initially phenomenological</i> models of complex ones.   </p>
<p>Simon has written an interesting discussion of the quasi-continuum that ranges from simple systems to complex ones:</p>
<p>&bull; H. A. Simon, <a href="http://www.eecs.ucf.edu/~dcm/Teaching/COP4600-Spring2011/Literature/Complexity-Simon.pdf">The architecture of complexity</a>, <i><a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/985254">Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society</a></i> <b>106</b> (1962), 467–482.</p>
<p>But if we take an ideological perspective on science that says &#8220;let&#8217;s unify everything!&#8221; (<a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-unity/">scientific monism</a>), a significant challenge is the development of a language able to unify our descriptions of simple and complex systems.  Such a language might help communication among scientists who work with complex systems that apparently involve multiple levels of organization. Something like category theory may provide the nucleus of the framework necessary to formally address this challenge. But, in order to head in that direction, I&#8217;ll try out a few examples in a series of posts, albeit from the somewhat limited perspective of a biologist, from which some patterns might begin to surface. </p>
<p>In this introductory post, I&#8217;ll try to set a basis for thinking about this tension between simple and complex systems without wading through any treatises on &#8216;complexity&#8217;. It will be remarkably imprecise, but I&#8217;ll try to describe the ways in which I think it provides a useful metaphor for thinking about how we humans have dealt with this simple &harr; complex tension in science. </p>
<p>Another tack that I think could accomplish a similar goal, perhaps in a clearer way, would be to discuss <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractals">fractals</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law">power laws</a> and maybe even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renormalization">renormalization</a>. I might try that out in a later post if I get a little help from my new Azimuth friends, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m qualified yet to do it alone.</p>
<h4>Simple and complex systems</h4>
<p>What is the organizational structure of the products of evolutionary processes? Herbert Simon provides a perspective that I find intuitive in his <a href="http://www.mech.kuleuven.be/goa/hms-int/parable.html">parable of two watchmakers</a>.</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://www.mech.kuleuven.be/goa/hms-int/parable.html" target="_blank"><img src="https://relationary.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/watch-parts1.jpg?w=450" alt="" /></a></div>
<p>He argues that the systems containing modules that don&#8217;t instantaneously fall apart (&#8216;stable intermediates&#8217;) and can be assembled hierarchically take less time to evolve complexity than  systems that lack stable intermediates.  Given a particular set of internal and environmental constraints that can only be satisfied by some relatively complex system, a hierarchically organized one will be capable of meeting those constraints with the fewest resources and in the least time (i.e. most efficiently).  The constraints any system is subject to determine the types of structures that can form. If <i>hierarchical</i> organization is an unavoidable outcome of evolutionary processes, it should be possible to characterize the causes that lead to its emergence.</p>
<p>Simon describes a property that some complex systems have in common, which  he refers to as &#8216;near decomposability&#8217;:</p>
<p>&bull; H. A. Simon, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;ved=0CC4QFjAD&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Foctopus.library.cmu.edu%2Fcgi-bin%2Ftiff2pdf%2Fsimon%2Fbox00021%2Ffld01496%2Fbdl0001%2Fdoc0001%2Fsimon.pdf&amp;ei=8HA3TsryHKfy0gGKoL3bAw&amp;usg=AFQjCNG7l94z8pVUPhR5-MkS1mFTDGLyyg">Near decomposability and the speed of evolution</a>, <i><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/icc/11.3.587">Industrial and Corporate Change</a></i> <b>11</b> (June 2002), 587-599.</p>
<p>A system is <b>nearly decomposable</b> if it&#8217;s made of parts that interact rather weakly with each other; these parts in turn being made of smaller parts with the same property. </p>
<p>For example, suppose we have a system modelled by a first-order linear differential equation. To be concrete, consider the fictitious building imagined by Simon: the Mellon Institute, with 12 rooms.  Suppose the temperature of the <i>i</i>th room at time <i>t</i> is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_i%28t%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T_i(t)" class="latex" />. Of course most real systems seem to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_system">nonlinear</a>, but for the sake of this metaphor we can imagine that the temperatures of these rooms interact in a linear way, like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7Bd%7D%7Bd+t%7DT_i%28t%29+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bj%7Da_%7Bij%7D%5Cleft%28T_%7Bj%7D%28t%29-T_%7Bi%7D%28t%29%5Cright%29%2C%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{d}{d t}T_i(t) = &#92;sum_{j}a_{ij}&#92;left(T_{j}(t)-T_{i}(t)&#92;right),} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_%7Bij%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a_{ij}" class="latex" /> are some numbers. Suppose also that the matrix <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_%7Bij%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a_{ij}" class="latex" /> looks like this:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/icc/11.3.587" target="_blank"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-f6Tm8UEpDC4/TjcmX_J27wI/AAAAAAAAGWk/yVY6MmiUIlI/s800/nearly_decomposable_matrix.png" alt="" /></a></div>
<p>For the sake of the metaphor I&#8217;m trudging through here, let&#8217;s also assume </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%5C%3B%5Cgg%5C%3B%5Cepsilon_l%5C%3B%5Cgg%5C%3B%5Cepsilon_2+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a&#92;;&#92;gg&#92;;&#92;epsilon_l&#92;;&#92;gg&#92;;&#92;epsilon_2 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Then our system is nearly decomposable.  Why?   It has three &#8216;layers&#8217;, with two cells at the top level, each divided into two subcells, and each of these subdivided into three sub-subcells. The numbers of the rows and columns designate the cells, cells 1–6 and 7–12 constitute the two top-level subsystems, cells 1–3, 4–6, 7–9 and 10–12 the four second-level sub- systems. The interactions within the latter subsystems have intensity <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a" class="latex" />, those within the former two subsystems, intensity <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon_l&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;epsilon_l" class="latex" />, and those between components of the largest subsystems, intensity <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon_2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;epsilon_2" class="latex" />. This is why Simon states that this matrix is in <b>near-diagonal form</b>. Another, probably more common, terminology for this would be <b>near <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_matrix#Block_diagonal_matrices">block diagonal</a> form</b>.  This terminology is a bit sloppy, but it basically means that we have a square matrix whose diagonal entries are square matrices and all other elements are <i>approximately</i> zero. That &#8216;approximately&#8217; there is what differentiates <i>near block diagonal matrices</i> from honest block diagonal matrices whose off diagonal matrix elements are precisely zero.</p>
<p>This is a trivial system, but it illustrates that the near decomposability of the coefficient matrix allows these equations to be solved in a <i>near</i> hierarchical fashion. As an approximation, rather than simulating all the equations at once (e.g. all twelve in this example) one can take a recursive approach and solve the four systems of three equations (each of the blocks containing <i>a</i>&#8216;s), and average the results to produce initial conditions for two systems of two equations with coefficients:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Bcccc%7D+%5Cepsilon_1+%26+%5Cepsilon_1+%26+%5Cepsilon_2+%26+%5Cepsilon_2+%5C%5C+++++++++%5Cepsilon_1+%26+%5Cepsilon_1+%26+%5Cepsilon_2+%26+%5Cepsilon_2%5C%5C+++++%5Cepsilon_2+%26+%5Cepsilon_2+%26+%5Cepsilon_1+%26+%5Cepsilon_1+%5C%5C+++++%5Cepsilon_2+%26+%5Cepsilon_2+%26+%5Cepsilon_1+%26+%5Cepsilon_1++++++++%5Cend%7Barray%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;begin{array}{cccc} &#92;epsilon_1 &amp; &#92;epsilon_1 &amp; &#92;epsilon_2 &amp; &#92;epsilon_2 &#92;&#92;         &#92;epsilon_1 &amp; &#92;epsilon_1 &amp; &#92;epsilon_2 &amp; &#92;epsilon_2&#92;&#92;     &#92;epsilon_2 &amp; &#92;epsilon_2 &amp; &#92;epsilon_1 &amp; &#92;epsilon_1 &#92;&#92;     &#92;epsilon_2 &amp; &#92;epsilon_2 &amp; &#92;epsilon_1 &amp; &#92;epsilon_1        &#92;end{array} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>and then average those results to produce initial conditions for a single system of two equations with coefficients:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Bcc%7D+%5Cepsilon_2+%26+%5Cepsilon_2+%5C%5C+++++%5Cepsilon_2+%26+%5Cepsilon_2++++%5Cend%7Barray%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;begin{array}{cc} &#92;epsilon_2 &amp; &#92;epsilon_2 &#92;&#92;     &#92;epsilon_2 &amp; &#92;epsilon_2    &#92;end{array}" class="latex" /></p>
<p>This example of simplification indicates that the study of a nearly decomposable systems system can be reduced to a series of smaller modules, which can be simulated in less computational time, if the error introduced in this approximation is tolerable. The degree to which this method saves time depends on the relationship between the size of the whole system and the size and number of hierarchical levels.  However, as an example, given that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_of_mathematical_operations#Matrix_algebra">time complexity for matrix inversion</a> (i.e. solving a system of linear equations) is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28n%5E2%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O(n^2)" class="latex" />, then the hierarchical decomposition would lead to an algorithm with time complexity </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+O%5Cleft%28%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7Bn%7D%7BL%7D%5Cright%29%5E2%5Cright%29%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ O&#92;left(&#92;left(&#92;frac{n}{L}&#92;right)^2&#92;right)} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>where <i>L</i> is the number of levels in the decomposition.   (For example, <i>L</i>=4 in the Mellon Institute, assuming the individual rooms are the lowest level).</p>
<p>All of this deserves to be made much more precise.  However, there are some potential metaphorical consequences for the evolution of complex systems:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>If we begin with a population of systems of comparable complexity, some of which are nearly decomposable and some of which are not, the nearly decomposable systems will, on average, increase their fitness through evolutionary processes much faster than the remaining systems, and will soon come to dominate the entire population. Notice that the claim is not that more complex systems will evolve more rapidly than less complex systems, but that, at any level of complexity, nearly decomposable systems will evolve much faster than systems of comparable complexity that are not nearly decomposable.</i> &#8211; Herbert Simon, 2002
</p></blockquote>
<p>The point I&#8217;d like to make is that in this system, the idea of switching back and forth between simple and complex perspectives is made explicit: we get a sort of conceptual <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax">parallax</a>: </p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax" target="_blank"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Parallax_Example.svg/450px-Parallax_Example.svg.png" alt="" /></a></div>
<p>In this simple case, the approximation that Simon suggests works well; however, for some other systems, it wouldn&#8217;t work at all. If we aren&#8217;t careful, we might even become victims of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning-Kruger_effect">Dunning-Kruger effect</a>.  In other words: if we don&#8217;t understand a system well from the start, we may overestimate how well we understand the limitations inherent to the simplifications we employ in studying it.  </p>
<p>But if we at least recognize the potential of falling victim to the Dunning-Kruger effect, we can vigilantly guard against it in trying to understand, for example, the currently paradoxical tension between &#8216;groups&#8217; and &#8216;individuals&#8217; that lies at the heart of evolutionary theory&#8230; and probably also the caricatures of evolution that breed social controversy. </p>
<p>Keeping this in mind, my starting point in the next post in this series will be to provide some examples of hierarchical organization in biological systems. I&#8217;ll also set the stage for a discussion of evolution viewed as a dynamic process involving structural and functional transitions in hierarchical organization&#8212;or for the physicists out there, something like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model">phase transitions</a>!</p>

				<small>22 July, 2011</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>Anyone seriously interested in global warming needs to learn about the &#8216;ice ages&#8217;, or more technically &#8216;glacial periods&#8217;.  After all, these are some of the most prominent <i>natural</i> variations in the Earth&#8217;s temperature.  And they&#8217;re rather mysterious.   They could be caused by changes in the Earth&#8217;s orbit called <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Milankovitch+cycle">Milankovich cycles</a>&#8230; but the evidence is not completely compelling.  I want to talk about that.</p>
<p>But to understand ice ages, the first thing we need to know is that the Earth hasn&#8217;t always had them!  The Earth&#8217;s climate has been cooling and becoming more erratic for the last 35 million years, with full-blown glacial periods kicking in only about 1.8 million years ago.  </p>
<p>So, this week let&#8217;s start with a little tour of the Earth&#8217;s climate history.  Somewhat arbitrarily, let&#8217;s begin with the extinction of the dinosaurs about 65 million years ago.   Here&#8217;s a graph of what the temperature has been doing since then:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://www.globalwarmingart.com/wiki/File:65_Myr_Climate_Change_Rev_png"><img width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature/65Myr.png" alt="" /></a></div>
<p>Of course you should have lots of questions about how this graph was made, and how well we really know these ancient temperatures!  But for now I&#8217;m just giving a quick overview&mdash;click on the graphs for more.  In future weeks I should delve into more technical details.  </p>
<h4> The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eocene">Paleocene Epoch</a>, 65 &#8211; 55 million years ago </h4>
<p>The Paleocene began with a bang, as an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicxulub_crater">asteroid 10 kilometers across</a> hit the Gulf of Mexico in an explosion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicxulub_crater#Impact_specifics">two million times larger</a> than the biggest nuclear weapon ever detonated.  A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megatsunami">megatsunami</a> thousands of meters high ripped across the Atlantic, and molten quartz hurled high into the atmosphere ignited wildfires over the whole planet.  A day to remember, for sure.</p>
<p>The Earth looked like this back then:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://www.scotese.com/K/t.htm"><img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.scotese.com/images/066.jpg" alt="" /></a></div>
<p>The Paleocene started out <i>hot</i>: the ocean was 10&deg; to 15&deg; Celsius warmer than today.   Then it got even hotter!  Besides a gradual temperature rise, at the very end of this epoch there was a drastic incident called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleocene-Eocene_Thermal_Maximum">Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum</a>&mdash; that&#8217;s the spike labelled &quot;PETM&quot;. Ocean surface  temperatures worldwide shot up by 5-8&deg;C for a few thousand years&mdash;but in the Arctic, it heated up even more, to a balmy 23&deg;C.   This caused a severe dieoff of little ocean critters called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foraminifera">foraminifera</a>, and a drastic change of the dominant mammal species.  What caused it?  That&#8217;s a good question, but right now I&#8217;m just giving you a quick tour.  </p>
<h4> The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eocene">Eocene Epoch</a>, 55 &#8211; 34 million years ago </h4>
<p>During the Eocene, temperatures continued to rise until the so-called &#8216;Eocene Optimum&#8217;, about halfway through.  Even at the start, the continents were close to where they are now&mdash;but the average annual temperature in arctic Canada and Siberia was a balmy 18 &deg;C.  The dominant plants up there were palm trees and cycads.  Fossil monitor lizards (sort of like alligators)  dating back to this era have been found in <a href="http://www.mapzones.com/world/europe/greenland/mapindex.php">Svalbard</a>,  an island north of Greenland that&#8217;s now covered with ice all year.  Antarctica was home to cool temperate forests, including  beech trees and ferns.  In particular, our Earth had <i>no permanent polar ice caps!</i>  </p>
<p>Life back then was very different.   The biggest member of the order <a href="http://tolweb.org/tree?group=Carnivora&amp;contgroup=Eutheria">Carnivora</a>, which now includes dogs, cats, bears, and the like, was merely the size of a housecat.  The largest predatory mammals were of another, now extinct order: the <a href="http://www.paleocene-mammals.de/predators.htm">creodonts</a>, like this one drawn by Dmitry Bogdanov:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creodonta"><br />
<img width="300" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Patriofelis22DB.jpg" alt="" /></a>
</div>
<p>But the biggest predator of all was not a mammal: it was<br />
<a href="http://hoopermuseum.earthsci.carleton.ca//flightless/diatryma.htm">Diatryma</a>,  the 8-foot tall &quot;terror bird&quot;, with a fearsome beak!</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creodonta"><br />
<img width="300" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/diatryma.jpg" alt="" /></a></div>
<p>But it&#8217;s not as huge as it looks here, because horses were only <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_the_horse#Hyracotherium">half a meter high back then</a>!</p>
<p>For more on this strange world and its end as the Earth cooled, see:</p>
<p>&bull; Donald R. Prothero, <i>The Eocene-Oligocene Transition: Paradise Lost</i>, Critical Moments in Paleobiology and Earth History Series, Columbia University Press, New York, 1994.</p>
<h4> The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligocene">Oligocene Epoch</a>, 34 &#8211; 24 million years ago</h4>
<p>As the Eocene drew to a close, temperatures began to drop.  And at the start of the Oligocene, they plummeted!   Glaciers started forming in Antarctica.  The growth of ice sheets led to a dropping of the sea level. Tropical jungles gave ground to cooler woodlands.  </p>
<p>What caused this?  That&#8217;s another good question.  Some seek the answer in plate tectonics.  The Oligocene is when India collided with Asia, throwing up the Himalayas and the vast Tibetan plateau. Some argue this led to a significant change in global weather patterns. But this is also the time when Australia and South America finally separated from Antarctica. Some argue that the formation of an ocean completely surrounding Antarctica led to the cooling weather patterns. After all, that lets cold water go round and round Antarctica without ever being driven up towards the equator.</p>
<h4> The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miocene">Miocene Epoch</a>, 24 &#8211; 5.3 million years ago </h4>
<div align="center"><a href="http://www.scotese.com/miocene.htm"><img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.scotese.com/images/014.jpg" alt="" /></a></div>
<p>Near the end of the Oligocene temperatures shot up again and the Antarctic thawed.   Then it cooled, then it warmed again&#8230; but by the middle of the Miocene, temperatures began to drop more seriously, and glaciers again formed on the Antarctic.  It&#8217;s been frozen ever since.  Why all these temperature fluctuations?  That&#8217;s another good question. </p>
<p>The Miocene is when grasslands first became common. It&#8217;s sort of amazing that something we take so much for granted&mdash;grass&mdash;can be so new! But grasslands, as opposed to thicker forests and jungles, are characteristic of cooler climates. And as Nigel Calder has suggested, grasslands were crucial to the development of humans!  Early hominids lived on the border between forests and grasslands.  That has a lot to do with why we stand on our hind legs and have hands rather than paws.  Much later, the agricultural revolution relied heavily on grasses like <a href="http://waynesword.palomar.edu/ecoph12.htm">wheat, rice, corn, sorghum, rye, and millet</a>. As we ate more of these plants, we drastically transformed them by breeding, and removed forests to grow more grasses.  In return, the grasses drastically transformed us: the ability to stockpile surplus grains ended our hunter-gatherer lifestyle and gave rise to cities, kingdoms, and slave labor.</p>
<p>So, you could say we coevolved with grasses!</p>
<p>Indeed, the sequence of developments leading to humans came shortly after the rise of grasslands. Apes split off from monkeys 21 million years ago, in the Miocene. The genus <i>Homo</i> split off from other apes like gorillas and chimpanzees 5 million years ago, near the beginning of the Pliocene.  The fully bipedal <i>Homo erectus</i> dates back to 1.9 million years ago, near the end of the Pliocene.  But we&#8217;re getting ahead of ourselves&#8230;</p>
<h4> The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliocene">Pliocene Epoch</a>, 5.3 &#8211; 1.8 million years ago </h4>
<div align="center"><a href="http://www.globalwarmingart.com/wiki/File:Five_Myr_Climate_Change_Rev_png"><img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature/5Myr.png" alt="" /></a></div>
<p>Starting around the Pliocene, the Earth&#8217;s temperature has been getting every more <i>jittery</i> as it cools.  Something is making the temperature unstable!  And these fluctuations are not just getting more severe&mdash;they&#8217;re also lasting longer.</p>
<p>These temperature fluctuations are far from being neatly periodic, despite the optimistic labels on the above graph saying &#8220;41 kiloyear cycle&#8221; and &#8220;100 kiloyear cycle&#8221;.  And beware: the data in the above graph was manipulated so it would synchronize with the Milankovitch cycles!  Is that really justified?  Do these cycles really cause the changes in the Earth&#8217;s climate?  More good questions.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a graph that shows more clearly the noisy nature of the Earth&#8217;s climate in the last 7 million years:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pliocene_benthic_carbonate_18O.png"><img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature/7Myr.png" alt="" /></a></div>
<p>You can tell this graph was made by a real paleontologist, because they like to put the present on the <i>left</i> instead of on the right. </p>
<p>And maybe you&#8217;re getting curious about this &#8220;&delta;<sup>18</sup>O benthic carbonate&#8221; business?  Well, we can&#8217;t directly measure the temperatures long ago by sticking a thermometer into an ancient rock!   We need to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_%28climate%29">&#8216;climate proxies&#8217;</a>: things we can measure now, that we <i>believe</i> are correlated to features of the climate long ago.  &delta;<sup>18</sup>O is the change in the amount of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen-18">oxygen-18</a> (a less common, heavier isotope of oxygen) in carbonate deposits dug up from ancient ocean sediments.  These deposits were made by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foraminifera">foraminifera</a> and other tiny ocean critters.  The amount of oxygen-18 in these deposits is used as temperature proxy: the more of it there is, the colder we think it was.  Why?  That&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9418O">another good question</a>.</p>
<h4> The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleistocene">Pleistocene Epoch</a>, 1.8 &#8211; .01 million years ago </h4>
<p>By the beginning of the Pleistocene, the Earth&#8217;s jerky temperature variations became full-fledged <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_age">&#8216;glacial cycles&#8217;</a>.  In the last million years there have been about ten glacial cycles, though it&#8217;s hard to count them in any precise way&mdash;it&#8217;s like counting mountains in a mountain range:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature.html#6Myr"><img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature/6Myr.jpg" alt="" /></a></div>
<p>Now the present is on the right again&mdash;but just to keep you on your toes, here <i>up</i> means <i>cold</i>, or at least more oxygen-18.  I copied this graph from:</p>
<p>&bull; Barry Saltzman, <em>Dynamical Paleoclimatology: Generalized<br />
Theory of Global Climate Change</em>, Academic Press, New York,<br />
2002, fig. 1-4.</p>
<p>We can get some more detail on the last four glacial periods from the change in the amount of deuterium in <a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/icecore/antarctica/vostok/vostok.html">Vostok</a> and <a href="http://www.esf.org/index.php?id=855">EPICA</a> ice core samples, and also changes in the amount of oxygen-18 in foraminifera (that&#8217;s the graph labelled &#8216;Ice Volume&#8217;):</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://www.globalwarmingart.com/wiki/File:Ice_Age_Temperature_Rev_png"><img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature/450kyr.png" alt="" /></a></div>
<p>As you can see here, the third-to-last glacial ended about 380,000 years ago.  In the warm period that followed, the first signs of <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neanderthal">Homo neanderthalensis</a></em> appear about 350,000 years ago, and the first  <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_sapiens">Homo sapiens</a></em> about 250,000 years ago.</p>
<p>Then, 200,000 years ago, came the second-to-last glacial period: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolstonian_Stage">Wolstonian</a>.  This lasted until about 130,000 years ago.  Then came a warm period called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eemian">Eemian</a>, which lasted until about 110,000 years ago.  During the Eemian, Neanderthalers hunted rhinos in Switzerland!  It was a bit warmer then that it is now, and sea levels may have been about 4-6 meters higher&mdash;worth thinking about, if you&#8217;re interested in the effects of global warming.  </p>
<p>The last glacial period started around 110,000 years ago.  This is called the Winsconsinan or W&uuml;rm period, depending on location&#8230; but let&#8217;s just call it the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_glacial_period">last glacial period</a>.   </p>
<p>A lot happened during the last glacial period.  <i>Homo sapiens</i> reached the Middle East 100,000 years ago, and arrived in central Asia 50 thousand years ago.  The Neanderthalers died out in Asia around that time.  They died out in Europe 35 thousand years ago, about when <i>Homo sapiens</i> got there.  Anyone notice a pattern?</p>
<p>The oldest cave paintings are 32 thousand years old, and the oldest known calendars and flutes also date back to about this time.   It&#8217;s striking how many radical innovations go back to about this time.  </p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://www.scotese.com/lastice.htm"><img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.scotese.com/images/LGM.jpg" alt="" /></a></div>
<p>The glaciers reached their maximum extent around 26 to 18 thousand years ago.   There were ice sheets down to the Great Lakes in America, and covering the British Isles, Scandinavia, and northern Germany.  Much of Europe was tundra.   And so much water was locked up in ice that the sea level was <a href="http://www.cmar.csiro.au/sealevel/sl_hist_intro.html">120 meters lower</a> than it is today!  </p>
<p>Then things started to warm up.  About 18 thousand years ago, <i>Homo sapiens</i> arrived in America.   In Eurasia, people started cultivating plants and herding of animals around this time.  </p>
<p>There was, however, a shocking setback 12,700 years ago: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Younger_Dryas">Younger Dryas</a> episode, a cold period lasting about 1,300 years.  We talked about this in <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/10/15/this-weeks-finds-week-304/">&#8220;week304&#8221;</a>, so I won&#8217;t go into it again here.  </p>
<p>The Younger Dryas ended about 11,500 years ago.  The last glacial period, and with it the Pleistocene, officially ended 10,000 years ago.  Or more precisely: 10,000 BP.  Whenever I&#8217;ve been saying &#8216;years ago&#8217;, I really mean <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Present">&#8216;Before Present&#8217;</a>, where the &#8216;present&#8217;, you&#8217;ll be amused to learn, is officially set in 1950.  Of course the precise definition of &#8216;the present&#8217; doesn&#8217;t matter much for very ancient events, but it would be annoying if a thousand years from now we had to revise all the textbooks to say the Pleistocene ended 11,000 years ago.  It&#8217;ll still be 10,000 BP.  </p>
<p>(But if 1950 was the <i>present</i>, now it&#8217;s the <i>future!</i>  This could explain why such weird science-fiction-type stuff is happening.)</p>
<h4> The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene">Holocene Epoch</a>, .01 &#8211; 0 million years ago </h4>
<p>As far as geology goes, the Holocene is a rather silly epoch, not like the rest.  It&#8217;s just a name for the time since the last ice age ended.  In the long run it&#8217;ll probably be called the Early <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropocene">Anthropocene</a>, since it marks the start of truly massive impacts of <i>Homo sapiens</i> on the biosphere.  We may have started killing off species in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternary_extinction_event">late Pleistocene</a>, but now <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_extinction">we&#8217;re killing more</a>&mdash;and changing the climate, perhaps even <a href="http://geosci.uchicago.edu/~archer/reprints/archer.2005.trigger.pdf">postponing the next glacial period</a>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what the temperature has been doing since 12000 BC:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://www.globalwarmingart.com/wiki/File:Holocene_Temperature_Variations_Rev_png"><img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.globalwarmingart.com/images/b/bb/Holocene_Temperature_Variations_Rev.png" alt="" /></a></div>
<p>Finally, here&#8217;s a closeup of a tiny sliver of time: the last 2000 years:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://www.globalwarmingart.com/wiki/File:2000_Year_Temperature_Comparison_png"><img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.globalwarmingart.com/images/c/c1/2000_Year_Temperature_Comparison.png" /></a></div>
<p>In both these graphs, different colored lines correspond to different studies; click for details.  The biggish error bars give people lots to argue about, as you may have noticed.  But right now I&#8217;m more interested in the big picture, and questions like these:</p>
<p>&bull; Why was it so hot in the early Eocene?</p>
<p>&bull; Why has it generally been cooling down ever since the Eocene?</p>
<p>&bull;  Why have temperature fluctuations been growing since the Miocene?  </p>
<p>&bull;  What causes the glacial cycles?   </p>
<h4>For More</h4>
<p>Next time we&#8217;ll get into a bit more detail.  For now, here are some fun easy things to read.  </p>
<p>This is a very enjoyable overview of climate change during the Holocene, and its effect on human civilization:</p>
<p>&bull; Brian Fagan, <i>The Long Summer</i>, Basic Books, New York, 2005.  Summary available at <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/The+Long+Summer">Azimuth Library</a>.</p>
<p>These dig a bit further back:</p>
<p>&bull; Chris Turney, <i>Ice, Mud and Blood: Lessons from Climates Past</i>, Macmillan, New York, 2008.</p>
<p>&bull; Steven Mithen, <i>After the Ice: A Global Human History 20,000-5000 BC</i>, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 2005.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t stomach the style of the second one: it&#8217;s written as a narrative, with a character named Lubbock travelling through time.  But a lot of people like it, and they say it&#8217;s well-researched.</p>
<p>For a history of how people discovered and learned about ice ages, try:</p>
<p>&bull; Doug Macdougall, <i>Frozen Earth: The Once and Future Story of Ice Ages</i>, University of California Press, Berkeley, 2004.</p>
<p>For something a bit more technical, but still introductory, try:</p>
<p>&bull; Richard W. Battarbee and Heather A. Binney, <i>Natural Climate Variability and Global Warming: a Holocene Perspective</i>, Wiley-Blackwell, Chichester, 2008.</p>
<p>To learn how this graph was made:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:65_Myr_Climate_Change.png"><img width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature/65Myr.png" alt="" /></a></div>
<p>and read a good overview of the Earth&#8217;s climate throughout the Cenozoic, read this:</p>
<p>&bull; James Zachos, Mark Pagani, Lisa Sloan, Ellen Thomas and Katharina Billups, <a href="http://www.essc.psu.edu/essc_web/seminars/spring2006/jan18/Zachosetal.pdf">Trends, rhythms, and aberrations in global climate 65 Ma to present</a>, <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/292/5517/686"><i>Science</i></a> <b>292</b> (27 April 2001), 686-693. </p>
<p>I got the beautiful maps illustrating continental drift from here:</p>
<p>&bull; Christopher R. Scotes, <a href="http://www.scotese.com/">Paleomap Project</a>.</p>
<p>and I urge you to check out this website for a nice visual tour of the Earth&#8217;s history.</p>
<p>Finally, I thank Frederik de Roo and Nathan Urban for suggesting improvements to this issue.  You can see what they said <a href="http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Mathforge/Azimuth/comments.php?DiscussionID=758&amp;Focus=4842#Comment_4842">on the Azimuth Forum</a>.  If you <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Forum+help">join</a> the forum, you too can help write This Week&#8217;s Finds!  I could really use help from earth scientists, biologists, paleontologists and folks like that: I&#8217;m okay at math and physics, but I&#8217;m trying to broaden the scope now.</p>

<p><i>We are at the very beginning of time for the human race. It is not unreasonable that we grapple with problems. But there are tens of thousands of years in the future. Our responsibility is to do what we can, learn what we can, improve the solutions, and pass them on.</i> &#8211; Richard Feynman</p>

<p>&#036;latex  E = mc^2&#036;</p>
<p>You need the word 'latex' right after the first dollar sign, and it needs a space after it.  Double dollar signs don't work, and other limitations apply, some described <a href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/latex/">here</a>.  You can't preview comments here, but I'm happy to fix errors.</p>
