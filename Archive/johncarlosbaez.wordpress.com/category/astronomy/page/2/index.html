					<p>The Laser Interferometric Gravitational-Wave Observatory or <a href="https://ligo.caltech.edu/">LIGO</a> is designed to detect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave">gravitational waves</a>&#8212;ripples of curvature in spacetime moving at the speed of light. It&#8217;s recently been upgraded, and it will either find gravitational waves soon or something really strange is going on.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/02/woohoo-email-stokes-rumor-gravitational-waves-have-been-spotted">Rumors are swirling</a> that LIGO has seen gravitational waves produced by two black holes, of 29 and 36 solar masses, spiralling towards each other&#8212;and then colliding to form a single 62-solar-mass black hole!</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll notice that 29 + 36 is more than 62.  So, it&#8217;s possible that <em>three solar masses were turned into energy, mostly in the form of gravitational waves!</em></p>
<p>According to these rumors, the statistical significance of the signal is supposedly very high: better than 5 sigma! That means there&#8217;s at most a 0.000057% probability this event is a random fluke &#8211; assuming nobody made a mistake.</p>
<p>If these rumors are correct, we should soon see an official announcement. If the discovery holds up, someone will win a Nobel prize.</p>
<p>The discovery of gravitational waves is completely unsurprising, since they&#8217;re predicted by general relativity, a theory that&#8217;s passed many tests already. But it would open up a new window to the universe &#8211; and we&#8217;re likely to see interesting new things, once gravitational wave astronomy becomes a thing.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the tweet that launched the latest round of rumors:</p>

<p>The first four sections of that long post discuss gravitational waves created by black hole collisions&#8212;but the last section is about LIGO and an earlier round of rumors, so I&#8217;ll quote it here!</p>

</div>
<p>LIGO stands for <a href="http://www.ligo.org/">Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory</a>.  The idea is simple.  You shine a laser beam down two very long tubes and let it bounce back and forth between mirrors at the ends.  You use this compare the length of these tubes.  When a gravitational wave comes by, it stretches space in one direction and squashes it in another direction.  So, we can detect it.</p>
<p>Sounds easy, eh?  Not when you run the numbers!   We&#8217;re trying to see gravitational waves that stretch space just a tiny bit: about one part in 10<sup>23</sup>.  At LIGO, the tubes are 4 kilometers long.  So, we need to see their length change by an absurdly small amount: <i>one-thousandth the diameter of a proton!</i></p>
<p>It&#8217;s amazing to me that people can even contemplate doing this, much less succeed.  They use lots of tricks:</p>
<p>• They bounce the light back and forth many times, effectively increasing the length of the tubes to 1800 kilometers.</p>
<p>• There&#8217;s no air in the tubes&#8212;just a very good vacuum.</p>
<p>• They hang the mirrors on quartz fibers, making each mirror part of a pendulum with very little friction.  This means it vibrates very <i>well</i> at one particular frequency, and very <i>badly</i> at frequencies far from that.  This damps out the shaking of the ground, which is a real problem.</p>
<p>• This pendulum is hung on another pendulum.</p>
<p>• That pendulum is hung on a third pendulum.</p>
<p>• That pendulum is hung on a fourth pendulum.</p>
<p>• The whole chain of pendulums is sitting on a device that detects vibrations and moves in a way to counteract them, sort of like noise-cancelling headphones.</p>
<p>• There are 2 of these facilities, one in Livingston, Louisiana and another in Hanford, Washington.  Only if <i>both</i> detect a gravitational wave do we get excited.</p>
<p>I visited the LIGO facility in Louisiana in 2006.  It was really cool!   Back then, the sensitivity was good enough to see collisions of black holes and neutron stars up to 50 million light years away.</p>
<p>Here I&#8217;m not talking about the supermassive black holes that live in the centers of galaxies.  I&#8217;m talking about the much more common black holes and neutron stars that form when stars go supernova.  Sometimes a <i>pair</i> of stars orbiting each other will both blow up, and form <i>two</i> black holes&#8212;or two neutron stars, or a black hole and neutron star.  And eventually these will spiral into each other and emit lots of gravitational waves right before they collide.</p>
<p>50 million light years is big enough that LIGO could see about half the galaxies in the Virgo Cluster.  Unfortunately, with that many galaxies, we only expect to see one neutron star collision every 50 years or so.</p>
<p>They never saw anything.  So they kept improving the machines, and now we&#8217;ve got <a href="https://www.advancedligo.mit.edu/">Advanced LIGO</a>!   This should now be able to see collisions up to 225 million light years away&#8230; and after a while, three times further.</p>
<p>They turned it on September 18th.  Soon we should see more than one gravitational wave burst each year.</p>
<p>In fact, there&#8217;s a rumor that they&#8217;ve already seen one!  But they&#8217;re still testing the device, and there&#8217;s a team whose job is to inject <i>fake signals</i>, just to see if they&#8217;re detected.  Davide Castelvecchi writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
LIGO is almost unique among physics experiments in practising ‘blind injection’. A team of three collaboration members has the ability to simulate a detection by using actuators to move the mirrors. “Only they know if, and when, a certain type of signal has been injected,” says Laura Cadonati, a physicist at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta who leads the Advanced LIGO’s data-analysis team.</p>
<p>Two such exercises took place during earlier science runs of LIGO, one in 2007 and one in 2010. Harry Collins, a sociologist of science at Cardiff University, UK, was there to document them (and has written books about it). He says that the exercises can be valuable for rehearsing the analysis techniques that will be needed when a real event occurs. But the practice can also be a drain on the team’s energies. “Analysing one of these events can be enormously time consuming,” he says. “At some point, it damages their home life.”</p>
<p>The original blind-injection exercises took 18 months and 6 months respectively. The first one was discarded, but in the second case, the collaboration wrote a paper and held a vote to decide whether they would make an announcement. Only then did the blind-injection team ‘open the envelope’ and reveal that the events had been staged.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Aargh!  The disappointment would be crushing.</p>
<p>But with luck, Advanced LIGO will soon detect real gravitational waves.  And I hope life here in the Milky Way thrives for a long time &#8211; so that when the gravitational waves from the doomed galaxy PG 1302-102 reach us, hundreds of thousands of years in the future, we can study them in exquisite detail.</p>

				<small>5 February, 2016</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>Ever since I became an environmentalist, the potential destruction wrought by aggressively expanding civilizations has been haunting my thoughts.  Not just here and now, where it&#8217;s easy to see, but in the future.</p>
<p>In October 2006, I wrote this in my <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/diary/october_2006.html#october27.06">online diary</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
A long time ago on this diary, I mentioned my friend Bruce Smith&#8217;s nightmare scenario.  In the quest for ever faster growth, corporations evolve toward ever faster exploitation of natural resources.  The Earth  is not enough.  So, ultimately, they send out self-replicating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_probe">von Neumann probes</a> that eat up solar systems as they go, turning the planets into more probes.  Different brands of probes will compete among each other, evolving toward ever faster expansion. Eventually, the winners will form a wave expanding outwards at nearly the speed of light&#8212;demolishing everything behind them, leaving only wreckage.  </p>
<p>The scary part is that even if we don&#8217;t let this happen,  some other civilization might.  </p>
<p>The last point is the key one.  Even if something is unlikely, in a sufficiently large universe it will happen, as long as it&#8217;s  <i>possible</i>.  And then it will perpetuate itself, as long as it&#8217;s evolutionarily fit.  Our universe seems pretty darn big.  So, even  if a given strategy is hard to find, if it&#8217;s a winning strategy it will get played somewhere.  </p>
<p>So, even in this nightmare scenario of &quot;spheres of von Neumann probes expanding at near lightspeed&quot;, we don&#8217;t need to worry about a bleak future for the universe as a whole&#8212;any more than we need to worry that viruses will completely kill off all higher life forms.  Some fraction of civilizations will probably develop defenses in time to repel the onslaught of these expanding spheres.
</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s not something I stay awake worrying about, but it&#8217;s a depressingly plausible possibility.  As you can see, I was trying to reassure myself that everything would be okay, or at least acceptable, in the long run.</p>
<p>Even earlier, S. Jay Olson and I wrote <a href="//arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0201030)">a paper</a> together on the limitations in accurately measuring distances caused by quantum gravity.  If you try to measure a distance too accurately, you&#8217;ll need to concentrate so much energy in such a small space that you&#8217;ll create a black hole!</p>
<p>That was in 2002.  Later I lost touch with him.  But now I&#8217;m happy to discover that he&#8217;s doing <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/all/1/all:+AND+jay+olson/0/1/0/all/0/1">interesting work</a> on quantum gravity and quantum information processing!   He is now at <a href="https://physics.boisestate.edu/olson/">Boise State University</a> in Idaho, his home state.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s the cool part: he&#8217;s also studying aggressively expanding civilizations.</p>
<div align="center"><img width="450" src="https://johncarlosbaez.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/de92e-alien_invasion.jpg?w=450" /></div>
<h3> Expanding bubbles </h3>
<p>What will happen if some civilizations start aggressively expanding through the Universe at a reasonable fraction of the speed of light?  We don&#8217;t have to assume most of them do.  Indeed, there can&#8217;t be too many, or they&#8217;d already be here!   More precisely, the density of such civilizations must be low at the present time.  The number of them could be infinite, since space is apparently infinite.  But none have reached us.  We may eventually become such a civilization, but we&#8217;re not one yet.</p>
<p>Each such civilization will form a growing &#8216;bubble&#8217;: an expanding sphere of influence.  And occasionally, these bubbles will collide!</p>
<p>Here are some pictures from a simulation he did:</p>
<div align="center">

</div>
<p>As he notes, the math of these bubbles has already been studied by researchers interested in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_%28cosmology%29">inflationary cosmology</a>, like Alan Guth.  These folks have considered the possibility that in the very early Universe, most of space was filled with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_vacuum">&#8216;false vacuum&#8217;</a>: a state of matter that resembles the actual vacuum, but has higher energy density.</p>
<p>A false vacuum could turn into the true vacuum, liberating energy in the form of particle-antiparticle pairs.  However, it might not do this instantly!  It might be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastability">&#8216;metastable&#8217;</a>, like ball number 1 in this picture:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastability"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Meta-stability.svg/320px-Meta-stability.svg.png" /></a></div>
<p>It might need a nudge to &#8216;roll over the hill&#8217; (metaphorically) and down into the lower-energy state corresponding to the true vacuum, shown as ball number 3.  Or, thanks to quantum mechanics, it might &#8216;tunnel&#8217; through this hill.</p>
<p>The balls and the hill are just an analogy.  What I mean is that the false vacuum might need to go through a stage of having even higher energy density before it could turn into the true vacuum.   Random fluctuations, either quantum-mechanical or thermal, could make this happen.  Such a random fluctuation could happen in one location, forming a &#8216;bubble&#8217; of true vacuum that&#8212;under certain conditions&#8212;would rapidly expand.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s actually not very different from bubbles of steam forming in superheated water!</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s the really interesting Jay Olson noted in his first paper on this subject.  Research on bubbles in the inflationary cosmology could actually be relevant to aggressively expanding civilizations!</p>
<p>Why?   Just as a bubble of expanding true vacuum has different pressure than the false vacuum surrounding it, the same might be true for an aggressively expanding civilization.  If they are serious about expanding rapidly, they may convert a lot of matter into radiation to power their expansion.  And while energy is conserved in this process, the <em>pressure</em> of radiation in space is a lot bigger than the pressure of matter, which is almost zero.</p>
<p>General relativity says that energy density slows the expansion of the Universe.   But also&#8212;and this is probably less well-known among nonphysicists&#8212;it says that <em>pressure</em> has a similar effect.  Also, as the Universe expands, the energy density and pressure of radiation drops at a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedmann_equations#Useful_solutions">different rate</a> than the energy density of matter.</p>
<p>So, the expansion of the Universe itself, on a very large scale, could be affected by aggressively expanding civilizations!</p>
<p>The fun part is that Jay Olson actually studies this in a quantitative way, making some guesses about the numbers involved.  Of course there&#8217;s a huge amount of uncertainty in all matters concerning aggressively expanding high-tech civilizations, so he actually considers a wide range of possible numbers.  But if we assume a civilization turns a large fraction of matter into radiation, the effects could be significant!</p>
<p>The effect of the extra pressure due to radiation would be to temporarily slow the expansion of the Universe.  But the expansion would not be stopped.  The radiation will gradually thin out.  So eventually, dark energy&#8212;which has negative pressure, and does not thin out as the Universe expands&#8212;will win.  Then the Universe will expand exponentially, as it is already beginning to do now.</p>
<p>(Here I am ignoring speculative theories where dark energy has properties that change dramatically over time.)</p>
<h3> Jay Olson&#8217;s work </h3>
<p>Here are his papers on this subject.  The abstracts sketch his results, but you have to look at the papers to see how nice they are.  He&#8217;s thought quite carefully about these things.</p>
<p>&bull; S. Jay Olson, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4359">Homogeneous cosmology with aggressively expanding civilizations</a>, <em>Classical and Quantum Gravity</em> <strong>32</strong> (2015) 215025.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <strong>Abstract.</strong> In the context of a homogeneous universe, we note that the appearance of aggressively expanding advanced life is geometrically similar to the process of nucleation and bubble growth in a first-order cosmological phase transition. We exploit this similarity to describe the dynamics of life saturating the universe on a cosmic scale, adapting the phase transition model to incorporate probability distributions of expansion and resource consumption strategies. Through a series of numerical solutions spanning several orders of magnitude in the input assumption parameters, the resulting cosmological model is used to address basic questions related to the intergalactic spreading of life, dealing with issues such as timescales, observability, competition between strategies, and first-mover advantage. Finally, we examine physical effects on the universe itself, such as reheating and the backreaction on the evolution of the scale factor, if such life is able to control and convert a significant fraction of the available pressureless matter into radiation. We conclude that the existence of life, if certain advanced technologies are practical, could have a significant influence on the future large-scale evolution of the universe.
</p></blockquote>
<p>&bull; S. Jay Olson, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.05969">Estimates for the number of visible galaxy-spanning civilizations and the cosmological expansion of life</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <strong>Abstract.</strong> If advanced civilizations appear in the universe with a desire to expand, the entire universe can become saturated with life on a short timescale, even if such expanders appear but rarely. Our presence in an untouched Milky Way thus constrains the appearance rate of galaxy-spanning Kardashev type III (K3) civilizations, if it is assumed that some fraction of K3 civilizations will continue their expansion at intergalactic distances. We use this constraint to estimate the appearance rate of K3 civilizations for 81 cosmological scenarios by specifying the extent to which humanity could be a statistical outlier. We find that in nearly all plausible scenarios, the distance to the nearest visible K3 is cosmological. In searches where the observable range is limited, we also find that the most likely detections tend to be expanding civilizations who have entered the observable range from farther away. An observation of K3 clusters is thus more likely than isolated K3 galaxies.
</p></blockquote>
<p>&bull; S. Jay Olson, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01521">On the visible size and geometry of aggressively expanding civilizations at cosmological distances</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <strong>Abstract.</strong> If a subset of advanced civilizations in the universe choose to rapidly expand into unoccupied space, these civilizations would have the opportunity to grow to a cosmological scale over the course of billions of years. If such life also makes observable changes to the galaxies they inhabit, then it is possible that vast domains of life-saturated galaxies could be visible from the Earth. Here, we describe the shape and angular size of these domains as viewed from the Earth, and calculate median visible sizes for a variety of scenarios. We also calculate the total fraction of the sky that should be covered by at least one domain. In each of the 27 scenarios we examine, the median angular size of the nearest domain is within an order of magnitude of a percent of the whole celestial sphere. Observing such a domain would likely require an analysis of galaxies on the order of a giga-lightyear from the Earth.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Here are the main assumptions in his first paper:</p>
<blockquote><p>
1. At early times (relative to the appearance of life), the universe is described by the standard cosmology – a benchmark Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) solution.  </p>
<p>2. The limits of technology will allow for self-reproducing spacecraft, sustained relativistic travel over cosmological distances, and an efficient process to convert baryonic matter into radiation.</p>
<p>3. Control of resources in the universe will tend to be dominated by civilizations that adopt a strategy of aggressive expansion (defined as a frontier which expands at a large fraction of the speed of the individual spacecraft involved), rather than those expanding diffusively due to the conventional pressures of population dynamics.</p>
<p>4. The appearance of aggressively expanding life in the universe is a spatially random event and occurs at some specified, model-dependent rate. </p>
<p>5. Aggressive expanders will tend to expand in all directions unless constrained by the presence of other civilizations, will attempt to gain control of as much matter as is locally available for their use, and once established in a region of space, will consume mass as an energy source (converting it to radiation) at some specified, model-dependent rate.
</p></blockquote>

<p>In December, the rover Curiosity reached some sand dunes on Mars, giving us the first views of these dunes taken from the ground instead of from above. It&#8217;s impressive how the dune seems to shoot straight up from the rocks here!</p>
<p>In fact this slope&#8212;the steep downwind slope of one of &#8220;Bagnold Dunes&#8221; along the northwestern flank of Mount Sharp&#8212;is just about 27&deg;.  But mountaineers will confirm that slopes always looks steeper than they are.</p>
<p>The wind makes this dune move about one meter per year.</p>

<p>About 3 billion years ago, if there was intelligent life on the galaxy we call PG 1302-102, it should have known it was in serious trouble.</p>
<p>Our galaxy has a supermassive black hole in the middle.  But that galaxy had two.  One was about ten times as big as the other.  Taken together, they weighed a billion times as much as our Sun.</p>
<p>They gradually spiraled in towards each other&#8230; and then, suddenly, one fine morning, they collided.  The resulting explosion was 10 million times more powerful than a supernova&#8212;more powerful than anything astronomers here on Earth have ever seen!  It was probably enough to wipe out all life in that galaxy.</p>
<p>We haven&#8217;t actually seen this yet.  The light and gravitational waves from the disaster are still speeding towards us.  They should reach us in roughly 100,000 years.  We&#8217;re not sure when.</p>
<p>Right now, we see the smaller black hole still orbiting the big one, once every 5 years.  In fact it&#8217;s orbiting once every 4 years!   But thanks to the expansion of the universe, PG 1302-102 is moving away from us so fast that time on that distant galaxy looks significantly slowed down to us.</p>
<p>Orbiting once every 4 years: that doesn&#8217;t sound so fast.  But the smaller black hole is about 2000 times more distant from its more massive companion than Pluto is from our Sun!  So in fact it&#8217;s moving at very high speed &#8211; about 1% of the speed of light.   We can actually see it getting redshifted and then blueshifted as it zips around.  And it will continue to speed up as it spirals in.</p>
<p>What exactly will happen when these black holes collide?  It&#8217;s too bad we won&#8217;t live to see it.  We&#8217;re far enough that it will be perfectly safe to watch from here!  But the human race knows enough about physics to say quite a lot about what it will be like.  And we&#8217;ve built some amazing machines to detect the gravitational waves created by collisions like this&#8212;so as time goes on, we&#8217;ll know even more.</p>

<p>Even before the black holes at the heart of PG 1302-102 collided, life in that galaxy would have had a quasar to contend with!</p>
<p>This is a picture of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centaurus_A">Centaurus A</a>, a much closer galaxy with a quasar in it.  A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasar">quasar</a> is huge black hole in the middle of a galaxy&#8212;a black hole that&#8217;s eating lots of stars, which rip apart and form a disk of hot gas as they spiral in.   &#8216;Hot&#8217; is an understatement, since this gas moves near the speed of light.  It gets so hot that it pumps out intense jets of particles &#8211; from its north and south poles.  Some of these particles even make it to Earth.</p>
<p>Any solar system in Centaurus A that gets in the way of those jets is toast.</p>
<p>And these jets create lots of radiation, from radio waves to X-rays.  That&#8217;s how we can see quasars from billions of light years away.  Quasars are the brightest objects in the universe, except for short-lived catastrophic events like the black hole collisions and gamma-ray bursts from huge dying stars.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to grasp the size and power of such things, but let&#8217;s try.  You can&#8217;t see the black hole in the middle of this picture, but it weighs 55 million times as much as our Sun.  The blue glow of the jets in this picture is actually X rays.  The jet at upper left is 13,000 light years long, made of particles moving at <i>half the speed of light</i>.</p>
<p>A typical quasar puts out a power of roughly 10<sup>40</sup> watts.  They vary a lot, but let&#8217;s pick this number as our &#8216;standard quasar&#8217;.</p>
<p>But what does 10<sup>40</sup> watts actually mean?  For comparison, the Sun puts out 4 x 10<sup>26</sup> watts.  So, we&#8217;re talking 30 trillion Suns.  But even that&#8217;s too big a number to comprehend!</p>
<p>Maybe it would help to say that the whole Milky Way puts out 5 x 10<sup>36</sup> watts.  So a single quasar, at the center of one galaxy, can have the power of 2000 galaxies like ours.</p>
<p>Or, we can work out how much energy would be produced if the entire mass of the Moon were converted into energy.  I&#8217;m getting 6 x 10<sup>39</sup> joules.  That&#8217;s a lot!  But our standard quasar is putting out a bit more power than if it were converting one Moon into energy each second.</p>
<p>But you can&#8217;t just turn matter completely into energy: you need an equal amount of antimatter, and there&#8217;s not that much around.   A quasar gets its power the old-fashioned way: by letting things fall down.   In this case, fall down <i>into a black hole</i>.</p>
<p>To power our standard quasar, 10 stars need to fall into the black hole every year.  The biggest quasars eat 1000 stars a year.  The black hole in <i>our</i> galaxy gets very little to eat, so we don&#8217;t have a quasar.</p>
<p>There are short-lived events much more powerful than a quasar.  For example, a gamma-ray burst, formed as a hypergiant star collapses into a black hole.   A powerful gamma-ray burst can put out 10^44 watts for a few seconds.  That&#8217;s equal to 10,000 quasars!  But quasars last a long, long time.</p>
<p>So this was life in PG 1302-102 <i>before</i> things got really intense &#8211; before its two black holes spiraled into each other and collided.  What was that collision like?  I&#8217;ll talk about that next time.</p>
<p>The above picture of Centaurus A was actually made from images taken by three separate telescopes.  The orange glow is submillimeter radiation &#8211; between infrared and microwaves&#8212;detected by the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) telescope in Chile.  The blue glow is X-rays seen by the Chandra X-ray Observatory.  The rest is a photo taken in visible light by the Wide Field Imager on the Max-Planck/ESO 2.2 meter telescope, also located in Chile.  This shows the dust lanes in the galaxy and background stars.</p>

</div>
<p>What happened at the instant the supermassive black holes in the galaxy PG 1302-102 finally collided?</p>
<p>We&#8217;re not sure yet, because the light and gravitational waves will take time to get here.  But physicists are using computers to figure out what happens when black hole collide!</p>
<p>Here you see some results.  The red blobs are the event horizons of two black holes.</p>
<p>First the black holes orbit each other, closer and closer, as they lose energy by emitting gravitational radiation.  This is called the &#8216;inspiral&#8217; phase.</p>
<p>Then comes the &#8216;plunge&#8217; and &#8216;merger&#8217;.  They plunge towards each other.  A thin bridge forms between them, which you see here.  Then they completely merge.</p>
<p>Finally you get a single black hole, which oscillates and then calms down.  This is called the &#8216;ringdown&#8217;, because it&#8217;s like a bell ringing, loudly at first and then more quietly.  But instead of emitting sound, it&#8217;s emitting gravitational waves&#8212;ripples in the shape of space!</p>
<p>In the top picture, the black holes have the same mass: one looks smaller, but that&#8217;s because it&#8217;s farther away.  In the bottom picture, the black hole at left is twice as massive.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s one cool discovery.   An earlier paper had argued there could be two bridges, except in very symmetrical situations.  If that were true, a black hole could have the topology of a torus for a little while.  But these calculations showed that &#8211; at least in the cases they looked at&#8212;there&#8217;s just one bridge.</p>
<p>So, you can&#8217;t have black hole doughnuts.  At least not yet.</p>
<p>These calculations were done using free software called <a href="http://www.black-holes.org/SpEC.html">SpEC</a>.  But before you try to run it at home: the team that puts out this software says:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Because of the steep learning curve and complexity of SpEC, new users are typically introduced to SpEC through a collaboration with experienced SpEC users.
</p></blockquote>
<p>It probably requires a lot of computer power, too.  These calculations are very hard.  We know the equations; they&#8217;re just tough to solve.  The first complete simulation of an inspiral, merger and ringdown was done in 2005.</p>
<p>The reason people want to simulate colliding black holes is not mainly to create pretty pictures, or even understand what happens to the event horizon.   It&#8217;s to understand the gravitational waves they will produce!  People are building better and better gravitational wave detectors&#8212;more on that later&#8212;but we still haven&#8217;t seen gravitational waves.  This is not surprising: they&#8217;re very weak.  To find them, we need to filter out noise.  So, we need to know what to look for.</p>

<h3> Part 4</h3>

<div align="center">
<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/milky-way-collide.html"><img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/astronomical/milky_way-andromeda-galaxy-3.75-billion.jpg" /></a>
</div>
<p>Let&#8217;s imagine an old, advanced civilization in the doomed galaxy PG 1302-102.</p>
<p>Long ago they had mastered space travel.  Thus, they were able to survive when their galaxy collided with another&#8212;just as ours will collide with Andromeda four billion years from now.  They had a lot of warning&#8212;and so do we.  The picture here shows what Andromeda will look like 250 million years before it hits.</p>
<p>They knew everything we do about astronomy&#8212;and more.  So they knew that when galaxies collide, almost all stars sail past each other unharmed.  A few planets get knocked out of orbit.  Colliding clouds of gas and dust form new stars, often blue giants that live short, dramatic lives, going supernova after just 10 million years.</p>
<p>All this could be handled by <i>not being in the wrong place at the wrong time</i>.   They knew the real danger came from the sleeping monsters at the heart of the colliding galaxies.</p>
<p>Namely, the supermassive black holes!</p>
<p>Almost every galaxy has a huge black hole at its center.  This black hole is quiet when not being fed.  But when galaxies collide, lots of gas and dust and even stars get caught by the gravity and pulled in.  This material form a huge flat disk as it spirals down and heats up.  The result is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_galactic_nucleus">active galactic nucleus</a>.</p>
<p>In the worst case, the central black holes can eat thousands of stars a year.  Then we get a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasar">quasar</a>, which easily pumps out the power of 2000 ordinary galaxies.</p>
<p>Much of this power comes out in huge jets of X-rays.  These jets keep growing, eventually stretching for hundreds of thousands of light years.  The whole galaxy becomes bathed in X-rays&#8212;killing all life that&#8217;s not prepared.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s imagine a civilization that <i>was</i> prepared.  Natural selection has ways of weeding out civilizations that are bad at long-term planning.  If you&#8217;re prepared, and you have the right technology, a quasar could actually be a good source of power.</p>
<p>But the quasar was just the start of the problem.  The combined galaxy had <i>two</i> black holes at its center.  The big one was at least 400 million times the mass of our Sun.  The smaller one was about a tenth as big&#8212;but still huge.</p>
<p>They eventually met and started to orbit each other.  By flinging stars out the way, they gradually came closer.  It was slow at first, but the closer they got, the faster they circled each other, and the more gravitational waves they pumped out.  This carried away more energy&#8212;so they moved closer, and circled even faster, in a dance with an insane, deadly climax.</p>
<p>Right now&#8212;here on Earth, where it takes a long time for the news to reach us&#8212;we see that in 100,000 years the two black holes will spiral down completely, collide and merge.  When this happens, a huge pulse of gravitational waves, electromagnetic radiation, matter and even antimatter will blast through the galaxy called PG 1302-102.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know exactly what this will be like.  I haven&#8217;t found papers describing this kind of event in detail.</p>
<p>One expert told the <i>New York Times</i> that the energy of this explosion will equal 100 million supernovae.  I don&#8217;t think he was exaggerating.   A supernova is a giant star whose core collapses as it runs out of fuel, easily turning several Earth masses of hydrogen into iron before you can say &#8220;Jack Robinson&#8221;.   When it does this, it can easily pump out 10<sup>44</sup> joules of energy.  So, 100 millon supernovae is 10<sup>52</sup> joules.  By contrast, if we could convert <i>all</i> the mass of the black holes in PG 1302-102. into energy, we&#8217;d get about 10<sup>56</sup> joules.  So, our expert was just saying that their merger will turns 0.01% of their combined mass into energy.  That seems quite reasonable to me.</p>
<p>But I want to know what happens then!  What will the explosion do to the galaxy?  Most of the energy comes out as gravitational radiation.  Gravitational waves don&#8217;t interact very strongly with matter.  But when they&#8217;re this strong, who knows?  And of course there will be plenty of ordinary radiation, as the accretion disk gets shredded and sucked into the new combined black hole.</p>
<p>The civilization I&#8217;m imagining was smart enough not to stick around.  They decided to simply <i>leave the galaxy</i>.</p>
<p>After all, they could tell the disaster was coming, at least a million years in advance.  Some may have decided to stay and rough it out, or die a noble death.  But most left.</p>
<p>And then what?</p>
<p>It takes a long time to reach another galaxy.  Right now, travelling at 1% the speed of light, it would take 250 million years to reach Andromeda from here.</p>
<p>But they wouldn&#8217;t have to go to another galaxy.  They could just back off, wait for the fireworks to die down, and move back in.</p>
<p>So don&#8217;t feel bad for them.  I imagine they&#8217;re doing fine.</p>

</div>
<p>When distant black holes collide, they emit a burst of gravitational radiation: a ripple in the shape of space, spreading out at the speed of light.  Can we detect that here on Earth?   We haven&#8217;t yet.  But with luck we will soon, thanks to LIGO.</p>
<p>LIGO stands for <a href="http://www.ligo.org/">Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory</a>.  The idea is simple.  You shine a laser beam down two very long tubes and let it bounce back and forth between mirrors at the ends.  You use this compare the length of these tubes.  When a gravitational wave comes by, it stretches space in one direction and squashes it in another direction.  So, we can detect it.</p>
<p>Sounds easy, eh?  Not when you run the numbers!   We&#8217;re trying to see gravitational waves that stretch space just a tiny bit: about one part in 10<sup>23</sup>.  At LIGO, the tubes are 4 kilometers long.  So, we need to see their length change by an absurdly small amount: <i>one-thousandth the diameter of a proton!</i></p>
<p>It&#8217;s amazing to me that people can even contemplate doing this, much less succeed.  They use lots of tricks:</p>
<p>• They bounce the light back and forth many times, effectively increasing the length of the tubes to 1800 kilometers.</p>
<p>• There&#8217;s no air in the tubes&#8212;just a very good vacuum.</p>
<p>• They hang the mirrors on quartz fibers, making each mirror part of a pendulum with very little friction.  This means it vibrates very <i>well</i> at one particular frequency, and very <i>badly</i> at frequencies far from that.  This damps out the shaking of the ground, which is a real problem.</p>
<p>• This pendulum is hung on another pendulum.</p>
<p>• That pendulum is hung on a third pendulum.</p>
<p>• That pendulum is hung on a fourth pendulum.</p>
<p>• The whole chain of pendulums is sitting on a device that detects vibrations and moves in a way to counteract them, sort of like noise-cancelling headphones.</p>
<p>• There are 2 of these facilities, one in Livingston, Louisiana and another in Hanford, Washington.  Only if <i>both</i> detect a gravitational wave do we get excited.</p>
<p>I visited the LIGO facility in Louisiana in 2006.  It was really cool!   Back then, the sensitivity was good enough to see collisions of black holes and neutron stars up to 50 million light years away.</p>
<p>Here I&#8217;m not talking about supermassive black holes like the ones in the doomed galaxy of my story here!  I&#8217;m talking about the much more common black holes and neutron stars that form when stars go supernova.  Sometimes a <i>pair</i> of stars orbiting each other will both blow up, and form <i>two</i> black holes&#8212;or two neutron stars, or a black hole and neutron star.  And eventually these will spiral into each other and emit lots of gravitational waves right before they collide.</p>
<p>50 million light years is big enough that LIGO could see about half the galaxies in the Virgo Cluster.  Unfortunately, with that many galaxies, we only expect to see one neutron star collision every 50 years or so.</p>
<p>They never saw anything.  So they kept improving the machines, and now we&#8217;ve got <a href="https://www.advancedligo.mit.edu/">Advanced LIGO</a>!   This should now be able to see collisions up to 225 million light years away&#8230; and after a while, three times further.</p>
<p>They turned it on September 18th.  Soon we should see more than one gravitational wave burst each year.</p>
<p>In fact, there&#8217;s a rumor that they&#8217;ve already seen one!  But they&#8217;re still testing the device, and there&#8217;s a team whose job is to inject <i>fake signals</i>, just to see if they&#8217;re detected.  Davide Castelvecchi writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
LIGO is almost unique among physics experiments in practising ‘blind injection’. A team of three collaboration members has the ability to simulate a detection by using actuators to move the mirrors. “Only they know if, and when, a certain type of signal has been injected,” says Laura Cadonati, a physicist at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta who leads the Advanced LIGO’s data-analysis team.</p>
<p>Two such exercises took place during earlier science runs of LIGO, one in 2007 and one in 2010. Harry Collins, a sociologist of science at Cardiff University, UK, was there to document them (and has written books about it). He says that the exercises can be valuable for rehearsing the analysis techniques that will be needed when a real event occurs. But the practice can also be a drain on the team’s energies. “Analysing one of these events can be enormously time consuming,” he says. “At some point, it damages their home life.”</p>
<p>The original blind-injection exercises took 18 months and 6 months respectively. The first one was discarded, but in the second case, the collaboration wrote a paper and held a vote to decide whether they would make an announcement. Only then did the blind-injection team ‘open the envelope’ and reveal that the events had been staged.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Aargh!  The disappointment would be crushing.</p>
<p>But with luck, Advanced LIGO will soon detect real gravitational waves.  And I hope life here in the Milky Way thrives for a long time &#8211; so that when the gravitational waves from the doomed galaxy PG 1302-102 reach us, hundreds of thousands of years in the future, we can study them in exquisite detail.</p>

</div>
<p>100,000 years ago, some of my ancestors came out of Africa and arrived in the Middle East.  50,000 years ago, some of them reached Asia.  But between those dates, about 70,000 years ago, two stars passed through the outer reaches of the Solar System, where icy comets float in dark space!</p>
<p>One was a tiny red dwarf called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholz%27s_star">Scholz&#8217;s star</a>.  It&#8217;s only 90 times as heavy as Jupiter.  Right now it&#8217;s 20 light years from us, so faint that it was discovered only in 2013, by Ralf-Dieter Scholz&#8212;an expert on nearby stars, high-velocity stars, and dwarf stars.</p>
<p>The other was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_dwarf">brown dwarf</a>: a star so small that it doesn&#8217;t produce energy by fusion.  This one is only 65 times the mass of Jupiter, and it orbits its companion at a distance of 80 AU.</p>
<p>(An <b>AU</b>, or <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit">astronomical unit</a></b>, is the distance between the Earth and the Sun.)</p>
<p>A team of scientists has just computed that while some of my ancestors were making their way to Asia, these stars passed about 0.8 light years from our Sun.  That&#8217;s not very close.  But it&#8217;s close enough to penetrate the large cloud of comets surrounding the Sun: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oort_cloud">Oort cloud</a>.</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oort_cloud"><br />
<img src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/astronomical/Kuiper_belt_Oort_cloud.png" /><br />
</a></div>
<p>They say this event didn&#8217;t affect the comets very much.  But if it shook some comets loose from the Oort cloud, they would take about 2 million years to get here!  So, they won&#8217;t arrive for a long time.</p>
<p>At its closest approach, Scholz&#8217;s star would have had an apparent magnitude of about 11.4.  This is a bit too faint to see, even with binoculars.  So, don&#8217;t look for it myths and legends!</p>
<p>As usual, the paper that made this discovery is expensive in journals but free on the arXiv:</p>
<p>• Eric E. Mamajek, Scott A. Barenfeld, Valentin D. Ivanov, Alexei Y. Kniazev, Petri Vaisanen, Yuri Beletsky, Henri M. J. Boffin, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04655">The closest known flyby of a star to the Solar System</a>.</p>
<p>It must be tough being a scientist named &#8216;Boffin&#8217;, especially in England!  Here&#8217;s a nice account of how the discovery was made:</p>
<p>• University of Rochester, <a href="http://www.rochester.edu/newscenter/scholz-star/">A close call of 0.8 light years</a>, 16 February 2015.</p>
<p>The brown dwarf companion to Scholz&#8217;s star is a &#8216;class T&#8217; star.  What does that mean?  It&#8217;s pretty interesting.  Let&#8217;s look at an example just 7 light years from Earth!</p>
<h3> Brown dwarfs </h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div align="center"><img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/astronomical/brown_dwarf_storm.jpg" /></div>
<p>Thanks to some great new telescopes, astronomers have been learning about <i>weather</i> on brown dwarfs!   It may look like this artist&#8217;s picture.  (It may not.)</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhman_16">Luhman 16</a> is a pair of brown dwarfs orbiting each other just 7 light years from us.  The smaller one,  Luhman 16B, is half covered by huge clouds.  These clouds are hot&#8212;1200 °C&#8212;so they&#8217;re probably made of sand, iron or salts.  Some of them have been seen to disappear!  Why?  Maybe &#8216;rain&#8217; is carrying this stuff further down into the star, where it melts.</p>
<p>So, we&#8217;re learning more about something cool: the &#8216;L/T transition&#8217;.</p>
<p>Brown dwarfs can&#8217;t fuse ordinary hydrogen, but a lot of them fuse the isotope of hydrogen called deuterium that people use in H-bombs&#8212;at least until this runs out.  The atmosphere of a hot brown dwarf is similar to that of a sunspot: it contains molecular hydrogen, carbon monoxide and water vapor.  This is called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_dwarf#Spectral_class_M">class M</a> brown dwarf.</p>
<p>But as they run out of fuel, they cool down.  The cooler <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_dwarf#Spectral_class_C">class L</a> brown dwarfs have clouds!  But the even cooler <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_dwarf#Spectral_class_T">class T</a> brown dwarfs do not.  Why not?</p>
<p>This is the mystery we may be starting to understand: the clouds may rain down, with material moving deeper into the star!  Luhman 16B is right near the L/T transition, and we seem to be watching how the clouds can disappear as a brown dwarf cools.   (Its larger companion, Luhman 16A, is firmly in class L.)</p>
<p>Finally, as brown dwarfs cool below 300 °C, astronomers expect that ice clouds start to form: first water ice, and eventually ammonia ice.  These are the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_dwarf#Spectral_class_Y">class Y</a> brown dwarfs.  Wouldn&#8217;t that be neat to see?   <i>A star with icy clouds!</i></p>
<p>Could there be <i>life</i> on some of these stars?</p>
<p>Caroline Morley regularly blogs about astronomy.  If you want to know more about weather on Luhman 16B, try this:</p>

<p>She doesn&#8217;t like how people call brown dwarfs &#8220;failed stars&#8221;.  I agree!  It&#8217;s like calling a horse a &#8220;failed giraffe&#8221;.</p>

</div>
<p>Can red dwarf stars have Earth-like planets with life?</p>
<p>This is an important question, at least in the long run, because 80% of the stars in the Milky Way are red dwarfs, even though none are visible to the naked eye.  20 of the 30 nearest stars are red dwarfs!  It would be nice to know if they can have planets with life.</p>
<p>Also, red dwarf stars live a long time!   They&#8217;re small&#8212;and the smaller a star is, the longer it lives.  Calculations show that a red dwarf one-tenth the mass of our Sun should last for 10 trillion years!</p>
<p>So if life is possible on planets orbiting red dwarf stars&#8212;or if life could get there&#8212;we could someday have very, very old civilizations.  That idea excites me.   Imagine what a galactic civilization spanning the 80 billion red dwarfs in our galaxy could do in 10 trillion years!</p>
<p>(No: you can&#8217;t imagine it.  You don&#8217;t have <i>time</i> to think of all the amazing things they could do.)</p>
<h3> Proxima Centauri </h3>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxima_Centauri"><br />
<img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/astronomical/proxima_centauri.jpg" /></a>
</div>
<p>Let&#8217;s start close to home.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxima_Centauri">Proxima Centauri</a>, the nearest star to the Sun, is a red dwarf.  If we ever explore interstellar space, we may stop by this star.  So, it&#8217;s worth knowing a bit about it.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t know if it has planets.  But it could be part of a triple star system!  The closest neighboring stars, Alpha Centauri A and B, orbit each other every 80 years.  One is a bit bigger than the Sun, the other a bit smaller.  They orbit in a fairly eccentric ellipse.  At their closest, their distance is like the distance from Saturn to the Sun.  At their farthest, it&#8217;s more like the distance from Pluto to the Sun.</p>
<p>Proxima Centauri is fairly far from both: a quarter of a light year away.  That&#8217;s about 350 times the distance from Pluto to the Sun!  We&#8217;re not even sure Proxima Centauri is gravitationally bound to the other stars.  If it is, its orbital period could easily exceed 500,000 years.</p>
<p>If Proxima Centauri had an Earth-like planet, there&#8217;s a bit of a problem: it&#8217;s a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flare_star">flare star</a>.</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/news/2013-05"><br />
<img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/astronomical/red_dwarf_flare_star.jpg" /></a>
</div>
<p>You see, convection stirs up this star&#8217;s whole interior, unlike the Sun.  Convection of charged plasma makes strong magnetic fields.  Magnetic fields get tied in knots, and the energy gets released through enormous flares!  They can become as large as the star itself, and get so hot that they radiate lots of X-rays.</p>
<p>This could be bad for life on nearby planets&#8230; especially since an Earth-like planet would have to be very close.  You see, Proxima Centauri is <i>very</i> faint: just 0.17% the brightness of our Sun!</p>
<p>In fact many red dwarfs are flare stars, for the same reasons.  Proxima Centauri is actually fairly tame as red dwarfs go, because it&#8217;s 4.9 billion years old.  Younger ones are more lively, with bigger flares.</p>
<p>Proxima Centauri is just 4.24 light-years away.  If explore interstellar space it may be a good place to visit.  It&#8217;s actually getting closer: it&#8217;ll come within about 3 light-years of us in roughly 27,000 years, and then drift by.  We should take advantage of this and go visit it soon, like in a few centuries!</p>
<h3> Gliese 667 Cc</h3>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gliese_667_Cc"><br />
<img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/astronomical/gliese_667Cc.jpg" /></a>
</div>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gliese_667">Gliese 667C</a> is a red dwarf just 1.4% as bright as our Sun.  Unremarkable: such stars are a dime a dozen.  But it&#8217;s famous, because we know it has at least two planets, one of which is quite Earth-like!</p>
<p>This planet, called  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gliese_667_Cc">Gliese 667 Cc</a>, is one of the most Earth-like ones we know today.  But it&#8217;s weirdly different from our home in many ways.  Its mass is 3.8 times that of Earth.  It should be a bit warmer than Earth&#8212;but dimly lit as seen by our eyes, since most of the light it gets is in the infrared.</p>
<p>Being close to its dim red dwarf star, its year is just 28 Earth days long.   But there&#8217;s something even cooler about this planet.  You can see it in the NASA artist&#8217;s depiction above.  The red dwarf Gliese 667C is part of a triple star system!</p>
<p>The largest star in this system, Gliese 667 A, is three-quarters the mass of our Sun, but only 12% as bright.  It&#8217;s an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-type_main-sequence_star">orange dwarf</a>, intermediate between a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_dwarf">red dwarf</a> and our Sun, which is considered a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-type_main-sequence_star">yellow dwarf</a>.</p>
<p>The second largest, Gliese 667 B, is also an orange dwarf, only 5% as bright as our sun.</p>
<p>These two orbit each other every 42 years.  The red dwarf Gliese 667 C is considerably farther away, orbiting this pair.</p>
<p>What could the planet Gliese 667 Cc be like?</p>
<h3> Tidally locked planets </h3>
<p><a href="http://www.space.com/22069-red-dwarf-stars-habitability.html"><br />
<img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/astronomical/water_trapped_world.jpg" /><br />
</a></p>
<p>Since a planet needs to be close to a red dwarf to be warm enough for liquid water, such planets are likely to be be tidally locked, with one side facing their sun all the time.</p>
<p>For a long time, this made scientists believe the day side of such a planet would be hot and dry, with all the water locked in ice on the night side, as shown above.  People call this a <b>water-trapped world</b>.  Perhaps not so good for life!</p>
<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.0540"><img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/astronomical/red_dwarf_planet.jpg" /><br />
</a></p>
<p>But a new paper argues that other kinds of worlds are likely too!</p>
<p>In a <b>thin ice waterworld</b>, an ocean covers most of the planet.  It&#8217;s covered with ice on the night side, maybe 10 meters thick.  The day side has open ocean.   Ice melts near the edge of the ice, pours into the ocean on the day side&#8230; while on the night side, water freezes onto the bottom of the ice layer.</p>
<p>In an <b>ice sheet-ocean world</b>, there&#8217;s a big ocean on the day side and a big continent on the night side.  As in the water-trapped world, a lot of ice forms on the night side, up to a kilometer thick.  But if there&#8217;s enough geothermal heat, and enough water, not all the water gets frozen on the night side: enough melts to form an ocean on the day side.</p>
<p>Needless to say, these new scenarios are exciting because they could be more conducive to life!</p>
<p>Read more here:</p>
<p>• Jun Yang, Yonggang Liu, Yongyun Hu and Dorian S. Abbot, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.0540">Water trapping on tidally locked terrestrial planets requires special conditions</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<b>Abstract:</b> Surface liquid water is essential for standard planetary habitability. Calculations of atmospheric circulation on tidally locked planets around M stars suggest that this peculiar orbital configuration lends itself to the trapping of large amounts of water in kilometers-thick ice on the night side, potentially removing all liquid water from the day side where photosynthesis is possible. We study this problem using a global climate model including coupled atmosphere, ocean, land, and sea-ice components as well as a continental ice sheet model driven by the climate model output. </p>
<p>For a waterworld we find that surface winds transport sea ice toward the day side and the ocean carries heat toward the night side. As a result, night-side sea ice remains about 10 meters thick and night-side water trapping is insignificant. If a planet has large continents on its night side, they can grow ice sheets about a kilometer thick if the geothermal heat flux is similar to Earth&#8217;s or smaller. Planets with a water complement similar to Earth&#8217;s would therefore experience a large decrease in sea level when plate tectonics drives their continents onto the night side, but would not experience complete day-side dessication. Only planets with a geothermal heat flux lower than Earth&#8217;s, much of their surface covered by continents, and a surface water reservoir about 10% of Earth&#8217;s would be susceptible to complete water trapping.
</p></blockquote>
<p>From a technical viewpoint, what&#8217;s fun about this new paper is that it uses detailed climate models that have been radically hacked to deal with a red dwarf star.  Paraphrasing:</p>
<blockquote><p>
We perform climate simulations with the <a href="http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/ccsm3.0/">Community Climate System Model version 3.0</a> (CCSM3) which was originally developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research to study the climate of Earth. The model contains four coupled components: atmosphere, ocean, sea ice, and land. The atmosphere component calculates atmospheric circulation and parameterizes sub-grid processes such as convection, precipitation, clouds, and boundary- layer mixing. The ocean component computes ocean circulation using the hydrostatic and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boussinesq_approximation_%28buoyancy%29">Boussinesq approximations</a>. The sea-ice component predicts ice fraction, ice thickness, ice velocity, and energy exchanges between the ice and the atmosphere/ ocean. The land component calculates surface temperature, soil water content, and evaporation.</p>
<p>We modify CCSM3 to simulate the climate of habitable planets around M stars following Rosenbloom et al., Liu et al., and Hu &amp; Yang. The stellar spectrum we use is a blackbody with an effective temperature of 3400 K. We employ planetary parameters typical of a super-Earth: a radius of 1.5 R<sub>⊕</sub>, gravity of 1.38 g<sub>⊕</sub>, and an orbital period of 37 Earth-days. The orbital period of habitable zone planets around M stars is roughly 10–100 days. We set the insolation to 866 watts per square meter and both the obliquity and eccentricity to zero. The atmospheric surface pressure is 1.0 bar, including N<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, and 355 parts per million CO<sub>2</sub>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>And so on.   Way cool!  They consider a variety of different kinds of continents and oceans&#8230; including one where they&#8217;re just like those here on Earth&#8212;just because the data for that is easy to get!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a question I don&#8217;t know the answer to.   To what extent can models like <a href="http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/ccsm3.0/">Community Climate System Model version 3.0</a> be tweaked to handle different planets?  And what are the main things we should worry about: ways Earth-like planets can be different enough to seriously throw off the models?</p>
<p>We live in exciting times, where just as we&#8217;re making huge progress trying to understand the Earth&#8217;s climate in time to make wise decisions, we&#8217;re discovering hundreds of new planets with their own very different climates.</p>

<p>This image, made by <a>Greg Egan</a>, shows the orbit of Venus.</p>
<p>Look down on the plane of the Solar System from above the Earth.  Track the Earth so it always appears directly below you, but don&#8217;t turn along with it.  With the passage of each year, you will see the Sun go around the Earth.  As the Sun goes around the Earth 8 times, Venus goes around the Sun 13 times, and traces out the pretty curve shown here.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s called the <b>pentagram of Venus</b>, because it has 5 &#8216;lobes&#8217; where Venus makes its closest approach to Earth.  At each closest approach, Venus move <i>backwards</i> compared to its usual motion across the sky: this is called <b>retrograde motion</b>.</p>
<p>Actually, what I just said is only <i>approximately</i> true.   The Earth orbits the Sun once every</p>
<p>365.256</p>
<p>days.  Venus orbits the Sun once every</p>
<p>224.701</p>
<p>days.  So, Venus orbits the Sun in</p>
<p>224.701 / 365.256 ≈ 0.615187</p>
<p>Earth years.  And here&#8217;s the cool coincidence:</p>
<p>8/13 ≈ 0.615385</p>
<p>That&#8217;s pretty close!   So in 8 Earth years, Venus goes around the Sun <i>almost</i> 13 times.  Actually, it goes around 13.004 times.</p>
<p>During this 8-year cycle, Venus gets as close as possible to the Earth about</p>
<p>13 &#8211; 8 = 5</p>
<p>times.  And each time it does, Venus moves to a new lobe of the pentagram of Venus!  This new lobe is</p>
<p>8 &#8211; 5 = 3</p>
<p>steps ahead of the last one.  Check to make sure:</p>

</div>
<p>That&#8217;s why they call it the <i>pentagram</i> of Venus!</p>
<div align="center"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagram"><br />
<img width="250" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/pentagram.png" /><br />
</a></div>
<p>When Venus gets as close as possible to us, we see it directly in front of the Sun.  This is called an <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_%28astronomy%29#Superior_and_inferior">inferior conjunction</a></b>.  Astronomers have names for all of these things:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/astronomical/positional_astronomy.png" />
</div>
<p>So, every 8 years there are about 5 inferior conjunctions of Venus.</p>
<p><b>Puzzle 1:</b>  Suppose the Earth orbits the Sun <i>n</i> times while another planet, closer to the Sun, orbits it <i>m</i> times.  Under what conditions does the &#8216;generalized pentagram&#8217; have <i>k</i> = <i>m</i> &#8211; <i>n</i> lobes?  (The pentagram of Venus has 5 = 13 &#8211; 8 lobes.)</p>
<p><b>Puzzle 2:</b> Under what conditions does the planet move forward <i>j</i> = <i>n</i> &#8211; <i>k</i> steps each time it reaches a new lobe?   (Venus moves ahead 3 = 8 &#8211; 5 steps each time.)</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve noticed that these numbers:</p>
<p>3, 5, 8, 13</p>
<p>are consecutive Fibonacci numbers.</p>
<p><b>Puzzle 3:</b> Is this just a coincidence?</p>
<p>As you may have heard, ratios of consecutive Fibonacci numbers give the best approximations to the golden ratio φ = (√5 &#8211; 1)/2.   This number actually plays a role in celestial mechanics: the <a href="http://www.phy.ilstu.edu/~rfm/380S13/chapters/CH6.9_KAMtheory.pdf">Kolmogorov&#8211;Arnol&#8217;d&#8211;Moser theorem</a> says two systems vibrating with frequencies having a ratio equal to φ are especially stable against disruption by resonances, because this number is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurwitz%27s_theorem_%28number_theory%29">hard to approximate</a> well by rationals.   But the Venus/Earth period ratio 0.615187 is actually closer to the rational number 8/13 ≈ 0.615385 than φ ≈ 0.618034.  So if this period ratio is trying to avoid rational numbers by being equal to φ, it&#8217;s not doing a great job!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all rather tricky, because sometimes rational numbers cause destabilizing resonances, as we see in the gaps of Saturn&#8217;s rings:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Saturn%27s_rings_dark_side_mosaic.jpg"><br />
<img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/astronomical/saturn_rings_92000_km.jpg" /></a>
</div>
<p>whereas other times rational numbers <i>stabilize</i> orbits, as with the moons of Jupiter:</p>
<div align="center">

<img src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/astronomical/Galilean_moon_Laplace_resonance_animation.gif" /></a>
</div>
<p>I&#8217;ve never understood this, and I&#8217;m afraid no amount of words will help me: I&#8217;ll need to dig into the math.</p>
<p>Given my fascination with <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/rolling/">rolling circles</a> and <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/numbers/#5">the number 5</a>, I can&#8217;t believe that I learned about the pentagram of Venus only recently!  It&#8217;s been known at least for centuries, perhaps millennia.  Here&#8217;s a figure from James Ferguson&#8217;s 1799 book <i>Astronomy Explained Upon Sir Isaac Newton&#8217;s Principles</i>:</p>
<div align="center">

</div>
<p>Naturally, some people get <i>too</i> excited about all this stuff&#8212;the combination of Venus, Fibonacci numbers, the golden ratio, and a &#8216;pentagram&#8217; overloads their tiny brains.  Some claim the pentagram got its origin from this astronomical phenomenon.  I doubt we&#8217;ll ever know.  Some get excited about the fact that a Latin name for the planet Venus is <b>Lucifer</b>.   Lucifer, pentagrams&#8230; get it?</p>
<p>I got the above picture from here:</p>
<p>• <a href="http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/anti-masonry/venus.html"> Venus and the pentagram</a>, Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon.</p>
<p>This website is defending the Freemasons against accusations of Satanism!</p>
<p>On a sweeter note, the pentagram of Venus is also called the <b>rose of Venus</b>.  You can buy a pendant in this pattern:</p>
<div align="center"><img width="350" src="https://i.etsystatic.com/14727678/r/il/d8ca00/1240662453/il_1588xN.1240662453_2omf.jpg" /></div>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty&#8212;but according to the advertisement, that&#8217;s not all!  It&#8217;s also &#8220;an energetic tool that creates a harmonising field of Negative Ion around our body to support and balance our own magnetic field and aura.&#8221;  <img src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/emoticons/not_listening.gif" /></p>
<p>In <i>The Da Vinci Code</i>, someone claims that Venus traces &#8220;a perfect pentacle across the ecliptic sky every 8 years.&#8221;</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not perfect!  Every 8 years, Venus goes around the Sun 13.004 times.   So the whole pattern keeps shifting.  It makes a full turn about once every 1920 years.  You can see this slippage using this nice applet, especially if you crank up the speed:</p>
<p>• Steven Deutch, <a href="https://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/AstronNotes/Earth-Venus.htm">The (almost) Venus-Earth pentagram</a>.</p>
<p>Also, the orbits of Earth and Venus aren&#8217;t perfect circles!</p>
<p>But still, it&#8217;s fun.  The universe is full of mathematical beauty.  It seems we need to get closer and closer to the fundamental laws of nature to make the math and the universe match more and more accurately.  Maybe that&#8217;s what &#8216;fundamental laws&#8217; means.  But the universe is also richly packed with beautiful <i>approximate</i> mathematical patterns, stacked on top of each other in a dizzying way.</p>

<p>SETI means &#8216;Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence&#8217;.  I&#8217;m giving a talk at the <a href="http://www.seti.org/">SETI Institute</a> on Tuesday December 17th, from noon to 1 pm.  You can <a href="http://plus.google.com/events/cfk79dttm5km6eemrvk288durbg">watch it live</a>, watch it later <a href="http://youtube.com/setiinstitute">on their YouTube channel</a>, or actually go there and see it.  It&#8217;s free, and you can just walk in at <a href="http://www.seti.org/seti-institute/about-seti/who-we-are/where-we-are">189 San Bernardo Avenue</a> in Mountain View, California, but please <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/lifes-struggle-to-survive-tickets-9656614193">register</a> if you can.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Life&#8217;s Struggle to Survive</h4>
<p>When pondering the number of extraterrestrial civilizations, it is worth noting that even after it got started, the success of life on Earth was not a foregone conclusion.  We recount some thrilling episodes from the history of our planet, some well-documented but others merely theorized: our collision with the planet Theia, the oxygen catastrophe, the snowball Earth events, the Permian-Triassic mass extinction event, the asteroid that hit Chicxulub, and more, including the global warming episode we are causing now.  All of these hold lessons for what may happen on other planets.
</p></blockquote>
<p>If you know interesting things about these or other &#8216;close calls&#8217;, please tell me!  I&#8217;m still preparing my talk, and there&#8217;s room for more fun facts.  I&#8217;ll make my slides available when they&#8217;re ready.</p>
<p>The SETI Institute looks like an interesting place, and my host, <a href="http://abrown.seti.org/">Adrian Brown</a>, is an expert on the poles of Mars.  I&#8217;ve been fascinated about the water there, and I&#8217;ll definitely ask him about this paper:</p>
<p>&bull; Adrian J. Brown, Shane Byrne, Livio L. Tornabene and Ted Roush, <a href="http://abrown.seti.org/publications/papers/Brown_et_al_2008_Louth_crater-Icarus.pdf">Louth crater: Evolution of a layered water ice mound</a>, <i>Icarus</i> <b>196</b> (2008), 433–445.</p>
<p>Louth Crater is a fascinating place.  Here&#8217;s a photo:</p>

<p>By the way, I&#8217;ll be in Berkeley from December 14th to 21st, except for a day trip down to Mountain View for this talk.  I&#8217;ll be at the Machine Intelligence Research Institute talking to Eliezer Yudkowsky, Paul Christiano and others at a <a href="http://intelligence.org/2013/07/24/miris-december-2013-workshop/">Workshop on Probability, Logic and Reflection</a>.  This invitation arose from my blog post here:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2013/03/31/probability-theory-and-the-undefinability-of-truth/">Probability theory and the undefinability of truth</a>.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re in Berkeley and you want to talk, drop me a line.  I may be too busy, but I may not.</p>

<div align="center"><img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.jonlomberg.com/articles/images/eti_beacon_location.jpg" /></div>
<p>Lisa and I had dinner with <a href="http://www.gregorybenford.com/">Gregory Benford</a> and his wife when I visited U.C. Irvine a couple of weekends ago, and he raised an interesting point.  So far, radio searches for extraterrestrial life have only seen puzzling brief signals &#8211; not long transmissions.  <i>But what if this is precisely what we should expect?</i></p>
<blockquote><p>
A provocative example is Sullivan, et al. (1997). This survey lasted about 2.5 hours, with 190 1.2 minute integrations. With many repeat observations, they saw nothing that did not seem manmade. However, they “recorded intriguing, non-repeatable, narrowband signals, apparently not of manmade origin and with some degree of concentration toward the galactic plane…”  Similar searches also saw one-time signals, not repeated (<a href="http://lib.bioinfo.pl/pmid:11540883">Shostak &amp; Tarter</a>, 1985; <a href="http://www.bigear.org/Gray-Marvel.pdf">Gray &amp; Marvel</a>, 2001 <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103584711997">Gray</a>, 2001). These searches had slow times to revisit or reconfirm, often days (<a href="http://astro.wsu.edu/allen/courses/astr450/annurev.astro.39.1.511.pdf">Tarter, 2001</a>). Overall, few searches lasted more than hour, with lagging confirmation checks (<a href="http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1993ApJ...415..218H&amp;data_type=PDF_HIGH&amp;whole_paper=YES&amp;type=PRINTER&amp;filetype=.pdf">Horowitz &amp; Sagan</a>, 1993).  Another striking example is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wow!_signal">“WOW” signal</a> seen at the Ohio SETI site&#8230;
</p></blockquote>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wow!_signal"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Wow_signal.jpg/320px-Wow_signal.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>That&#8217;s a quote from a paper Benford wrote with his brother and nephew:</p>
<p>• Gregory Benford, James Benford, and Dominic Benford, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.3966">Searching for cost optimized interstellar beacons</a>.</p>
<p>They claim the cheapest way a civilization could communicate to lots of planets is a pulsed, broadband, narrowly focused microwave beam that scans the sky.  So, for anyone receiving this signal, there would be a lot of time between pulses.  That might explain some of the above mysteries, or this one:</p>
<blockquote><p>
As an example of using cost optimized beacon analysis for SETI purposes, consider in detail the puzzling transient bursting radio source, GCRT J17445-3009, which has extremely unusual properties. It was discovered in 2002 in the direction of the Galactic Center (1.25° south of GC) at 330 MHz in a VLA observation and subsequently re-observed in 2003 and 2004 in GMRT observations (Hyman, 2005, 2006, 2007). It is a pulsed coherent source, with the ‘burst’ lasting as much as 10 minutes, with 77-minute period. Averaged over all observations, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0503052">Hyman <i>et al.</i></a> give a duty cycle of 7% (1/14), although since some observations may have missed part of bursts, the duty cycle might be as high as 13%.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Even if these are red herrings, it seems very smart to figure out the cheapest ways to transmit signals and use that to guess what signals we should look for.  We can easily make the mistake of assuming all extraterrestrial civilizations who bother to send signals through space will be willing to beam signals of enormous power toward us all the time.  That could be true of <i>some</i>, but not necessarily all.  </p>
<p>The cost analysis is here:</p>
<p>• James Benford, Gregory Benford, Dominic Benford, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.3964">Messaging with cost optimized interstellar beacons</a>.</p>
<p>and you can see a summary in this talk by Gregory&#8217;s brother James, who works on high-power microwave technologies:</p>

				<small>22 March, 2013</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>Yesterday, the <a href="http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=51551">Planck Mission</a> released a new map of the cosmic microwave background radiation:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/astronomical/planck_cosmic_microwave_background.jpg"><img width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/astronomical/planck_cosmic_microwave_background.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>380,000 years after the Big Bang, the Universe cooled down enough for protons and electrons to settle down and combine into hydrogen atoms. Protons and electrons are charged, so back when they were freely zipping around, no light could go very far without getting absorbed and then re-radiated.   When they combined into neutral hydrogen atoms, the Universe soon switched to being almost transparent&#8230; as it is today.  So the light emitted from that time is still visible now!</p>
<p>And it would look like this picture here&#8230; if you could see microwaves.</p>
<p>When this light was first emitted, it would have looked white to our eyes, since the temperature of the Universe was about 4000 kelvin.  That&#8217;s the temperature when half the hydrogen atoms split apart into electrons and protons.  4200 kelvin looks like a fluorescent light; 2800 kelvin like an incandescent bulb, rather yellow. </p>
<p>But as the Universe expanded, this light got stretched out to orange, red, infrared&#8230; and finally a dim microwave glow, invisible to human eyes.  The average temperature of this glow is very close to absolute zero, but it&#8217;s been measured very precisely: 2.725 kelvin. </p>
<p>But the temperature of the glow is not the same in every direction! There are tiny fluctuations!  You can see them in this picture.  The colors here span a range of ± .0002 kelvin. </p>
<p>These fluctuations are very important, because they were later amplified by gravity, with denser patches of gas collapsing under their own gravitational attraction (thanks in part to dark matter), and becoming even denser&#8230; eventually leading to galaxies, stars and planets, you and me.</p>
<p>But where did these fluctuations come from?  I suspect they started life as quantum fluctuations in an originally completely homogeneous Universe.  Quantum mechanics takes quite a while to explain &#8211; but in this theory a situation can be completely symmetrical, yet when you measure it, you get an asymmetrical result.  The universe is then a &#8216;sum&#8217; of worlds where these different results are seen.  The overall universe is still symmetrical, but each observer sees just a part: an asymmetrical part.</p>
<p>If you take this seriously, there are other worlds where fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background radiation take all possible patterns&#8230; and form galaxies in all possible patterns.  So while the universe as we see it is asymmetrical, with galaxies and stars and planets and you and me arranged in a complicated and seemingly arbitrary way, the overall universe is still symmetrical &#8211; perfectly homogeneous!</p>
<p>That seems very nice to me.  But the great thing is, we can learn more about this, not just by chatting, but by testing theories against ever more precise measurements.  The Planck Mission is a great improvement over the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), which in turn was a huge improvement over the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE):</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/735692main_pia16874-43_946-710.jpg"><img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.nasa.gov/images/content/735692main_pia16874-43_946-710.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>Here is some of what they&#8217;ve learned:</p>
<p>• It now seems the Universe is 13.82 ± 0.05 billion years old.  This is a bit higher than the previous estimate of 13.77 ± 0.06 billion years, due to the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe.</p>
<p>•  It now seems the rate at which the universe is expanding, known as Hubble&#8217;s constant, is 67.15 ± 1.2 kilometers per second per megaparsec. A megaparsec is roughly 3 million light-years. This is less than earlier estimates using space telescopes, such as NASA&#8217;s Spitzer and Hubble.</p>
<p>• It now seems the fraction of mass-energy in the Universe in the form of dark matter is 26.8%, up from 24%.  Dark energy is now estimated at 68.3%, down from 71.4%. And normal matter is now estimated at 4.9%, up from 4.6%.  </p>
<p>These cosmological parameters, and a bunch more, are estimated here:</p>
<p>• <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5076">Planck 2013 results. XVI. Cosmological parameters</a>. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s amazing how we&#8217;re getting more and more accurate numbers for these basic facts about our world!  But the real surprises lie elsewhere&#8230; </p>
<h3> A lopsided universe, with a cold spot? </h3>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/astronomical/planck_cosmic_microwave_background.jpg"><img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/astronomical/planck_anomalies.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>The Planck Mission found two big surprises in the cosmic microwave background:</p>
<p>• This radiation is slightly different on opposite sides of the sky!  This is <i>not</i> due to the fact that the Earth is moving relative to the average position of galaxies.  That fact does make the radiation look hotter in the direction we&#8217;re moving.  But that produces a simple pattern called a &#8216;dipole moment&#8217; in the temperature map.  If we subtract that out, it seems there are real differences between two sides of the Universe&#8230; and they are complex, interesting, and not explained by the usual theories!  </p>
<p>• There is a cold spot that seems too big to be caused by chance.  If this is for real, it&#8217;s the largest thing in the Universe.</p>
<p>Could these anomalies be due to experimental errors, or errors in data analysis?  I don&#8217;t know!   They were already seen by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe; for example, here is WMAP&#8217;s picture of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMB_cold_spot">cold spot</a>:</p>
<div align="center"><img width="300" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/astronomical/WMAP_cold_spot.jpg" /></div>
<p>The Planck Mission seems to be seeing them more clearly with its better measurements.  Paolo Natoli, from the University of Ferrara writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The Planck data call our attention to these anomalies, which are now more important than ever: with data of such quality, we can no longer neglect them as mere artefacts and we must search for an explanation. The anomalies indicate that something might be missing from our current understanding of the Universe. We need to find a model where these peculiar traits are no longer anomalies but features predicted by the model itself.
</p></blockquote>
<p>For a lot more detail, see this paper:</p>
<p>• <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5083">Planck 2013 results. XXIII. Isotropy and statistics of the CMB</a>.</p>
<p>(I apologize for not listing the authors on these papers, but there are hundreds!)  Let me paraphrase the abstract for people who want just a <i>little</i> more detail:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Many of these anomalies were previously observed in the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe data, and are now confirmed at similar levels of significance (around 3 standard deviations). However, we find little evidence for non-Gaussianity with the exception of a few statistical signatures that seem to be associated with specific anomalies. In particular, we find that the quadrupole-octopole alignment is also connected to a low observed variance of the cosmic microwave background signal. The dipolar power asymmetry is now found to persist to much smaller angular scales, and can be described in the low-frequency regime by a phenomenological dipole modulation model. Finally, it is plausible that some of these features may be reflected in the angular power spectrum of the data which shows a deficit of power on the same scales. Indeed, when the power spectra of two hemispheres defined by a preferred direction are considered separately, one shows evidence for a deficit in power, whilst its opposite contains oscillations between odd and even modes that may be related to the parity violation and phase correlations also detected in the data. Whilst these analyses represent a step forward in building an understanding of the anomalies, a satisfactory explanation based on physically motivated models is still lacking.
</p></blockquote>
<p>If you&#8217;re a scientist, your mouth should be watering now&#8230; your tongue should be hanging out!   If this stuff holds up, it&#8217;s amazing, because it would call for real new physics.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard that the difference between hemispheres might fit the simplest homogeneous but not isotropic solutions of general relativity, the Bianchi models.  However, this is something one should carefully test using statistics&#8230; and I&#8217;m sure people will start doing this now.</p>
<p>As for the cold spot, the best explanation I can imagine is some sort of mechanism for producing fluctuations very early on&#8230; so that these fluctuations would get blown up to enormous size during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflationary_epoch">inflationary epoch</a>, roughly between 10<sup>-36</sup> and 10<sup>-32</sup> seconds after the Big Bang.  I don&#8217;t know what this mechanism would be!   </p>
<p>There are also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMB_cold_spot">ways of trying to &#8216;explain away&#8217; the cold spot</a>, but even these seem jaw-droppingly dramatic.  For example, an almost empty region 150 megaparsecs (500 million light-years) across would tend to cool down cosmic microwave background radiation coming through it.   But it would still be the largest thing in the Universe!  And such an unusual void would seem to beg for an explanation of its own.</p>
<h3> Particle physics </h3>
<p>The Planck Mission also shed a lot of light on particle physics, and especially on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_%28cosmology%29">inflation</a>.  But, it mainly seems to have confirmed what particle physicists already suspected!  This makes them rather grumpy, because these days they&#8217;re always hoping for something <i>new</i>, and they&#8217;re not getting it.</p>
<p>We can see this at Jester&#8217;s blog <a href="http://resonaances.blogspot.com/2013/03/the-universe-after-planck.html">R&eacute;sonaances</a>, which also gives a very nice, though technical, summary of what the Planck Mission did for particle physics:</p>
<blockquote><p>
From a particle physicist&#8217;s point of view the single most interesting observable from Planck is the notorious <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N_%7B%5Cmathrm%7Beff%7D%7D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="N_{&#92;mathrm{eff}}." class="latex" /> This observable measures the effective number of degrees of freedom with sub-eV mass that coexisted with the photons in the plasma at the time when the CMB was formed (see e.g. my <a href="http://resonaances.blogspot.fr/2013/01/how-many-neutrinos-in-sky.html">older post</a> for more explanations).

Some models beyond the standard model featuring sterile neutrinos, dark photons, or axions could lead to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N_%7B%5Cmathrm%7Beff%7D%7D+%3E+3%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="N_{&#92;mathrm{eff}} &gt; 3," class="latex" /> not necessarily an integer.  For a long time various experimental groups have claimed <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N_%7B%5Cmathrm%7Beff%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="N_{&#92;mathrm{eff}}" class="latex" /> much larger than 3, but with an error too large to blow the trumpets. Planck was supposed to sweep the floor and it did. They find </p>

<p>that is, no hint of anything interesting going on. The gurgling sound you hear behind the wall is probably your colleague working on sterile neutrinos committing a ritual suicide.</p>
<p>Another number of interest for particle theorists is the sum of neutrino masses. Recall that oscillation experiments tell us only about the mass differences, whereas the absolute neutrino mass scale is still unknown.  Neutrino masses larger than 0.1 eV would produce an observable imprint into the CMB. [&#8230;.]  Planck sees no hint of neutrino masses and puts the 95% CL limit at 0.23 eV.</p>
<p>Literally, the most valuable Planck result is the measurement of the spectral index <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n_s%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n_s," class="latex" /> as it may tip the scale for the Nobel committee to finally hand out the prize for inflation. Simplest models of inflation (e.g., a scalar field φ with a φ<sup>n</sup> potential slowly changing its vacuum expectation value) predicts the spectrum of primordial density fluctuations that is adiabatic (the same in all components) and Gaussian (full information is contained in the 2-point correlation function). Much as previous CMB experiments, Planck does not see any departures from that hypothesis. A more quantitative  prediction of simple inflationary models is that the primordial spectrum of fluctuations is almost but not exactly scale-invariant. More precisely, the spectrum is of the form </p>

This number can of course also be fitted in more complicated models or in alternatives to inflation, but it is nevertheless a strong support for the most trivial version of inflation.</p>
<p>[&#8230;.]</p>
<p>In summary, the cosmological results from Planck are really impressive. We&#8217;re looking into a pretty wide range of complex physical phenomena occurring billions of years ago. And, at the end of the day, we&#8217;re getting a perfect description with a fairly simple model. If this is not a moment to cry out <i>&#8220;science works bitches&#8221;</i>, nothing is. Particle physicists, however, can find little inspiration in the Planck results. For us, what Planck has observed is by no means an <i>almost perfect universe</i>&#8230; it&#8217;s rather  <i>the most boring</i> universe.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I find it hilarious to hear someone complain that the universe is &#8220;boring&#8221; on a day when astrophysicists say they&#8217;ve discovered the universe is lopsided and has a huge cold region, the <i>largest thing ever seen by humans!</i>  </p>
<p>However, particle physicists seem so far rather skeptical of these exciting developments.  Is this sour grapes, or are they being wisely cautious?  </p>
<p>Time, as usual, will tell.</p>
