					<p>One of my goals is to turn category theory, and even <a>higher category theory</a>, into a practical tool for science.  For this we need good scientific ideas&#8212;but we also need good software.</p>
<p>My friend <a href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/jamie.vicary/">Jamie Vicary</a> has been developing some of this software, together with <a href="http://www.cs.ru.nl/A.Kissinger/">Aleks Kissinger</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/krzysztof.bar/">Krzysztof Bar</a> and others.  Jamie demonstrated it at the Simons Institute <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2016/11/01/compositionality-workshop/">workshop on compositionality</a>.  You can watch his demonstration here:</p>

<blockquote><p>
  <strong>Abstract.</strong> Higher category theory is one of the most general approaches to compositionality, with broad and striking applications across computer science, mathematics and physics. We present a new, simple way to define higher categories, in which many important compositional properties emerge as theorems, rather than axioms. Our approach is amenable to computer implementation, and we present a new proof assistant we have developed, with a powerful graphical calculus. In particular, we will outline a substantial new proof we have developed in our setting.

<p>And in December 2015, he wrote an <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2015/12/globular.html">article about this software on the <i>n</i>-Category Café</a>.  It&#8217;s been improved since then, but it can&#8217;t hurt to read what he wrote&#8212;so I append it here!</p>
<h3><i>Globular</i>: the basic idea</h3>
<p>When you&#8217;re trying to prove something in a monoidal category, or a higher category, string diagrams are a really useful technique, especially when you&#8217;re trying to get an intuition for what you&#8217;re doing.  But when it comes to writing up your results, the problems start to mount. For a complex proof, it&#8217;s hard to be sure your result is correct&#8212;a slip of the pen could lead to a false proof, and an error that&#8217;s hard to find. And writing up your results can be a huge time-sink, requiring weeks or months using a graphics package, all just for some nice pictures that tell you little about the correctness of the proof, and become useless if you decide to change your approach. Computers should be able help with all these things, in the way that proof assistants like Coq and Agda are allowing us to work with traditional syntactic proofs in a more sophisticated way.</p>
<p>The purpose of this post is to introduce <i>Globular</i>, a new proof assistant for working with higher-categorical proofs using string diagrams. It&#8217;s available at <a href="http://globular.science">http://globular.science</a>, with <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Globular">documentation on the <i>n</i>ab</a>. It&#8217;s web-based, so everything happens right in your browser: build formal proofs, visualize and step through them; keep your proofs private, share them with collaborators, or make them publicly available.</p>
<p>Before we get into the technical details, here&#8217;s a screenshot of <i>Globular</i> in action:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/24hvrek25epze6i/GlobularScreenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of Globular" width="200" /></div>
<p>The main part of the screen shows a <i>diagram</i>, which in this case is 2-dimensional. It represents a composite 2-cell in a finitely-presented 2-category, with the blue and red regions representing objects, the lines representing 1-cells, and the vertices representing 2-cells. In fact, this 2d diagram is just an intermediate state of a 3d proof, through which we&#8217;re navigating with the &#8216;Slice&#8217; controls in the top-right. The proof itself has been built up by composing the generators listed in the <i>signature</i>, down the left-hand side of the screen. (If you want to take a look at this proof yourself, you can <a href="http://globular.science/1512.007">go straight there</a>; in the top-right, set &#8216;Project&#8217; to 0, then increment the second &#8216;Slice&#8217; counter to scroll through the proof.)</p>
<p><i>Globular</i> has been developed so far in the <a href='http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/activities/quantum/'>Quantum Group</a> in<br />
the Oxford Computer Science department, by <a href='https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/krzysztof.bar/'>Krzysztof<br />
Bar</a>, Katherine Casey, <a href='http://www.cs.ru.nl/A.Kissinger/'>Aleks Kissinger</a>, <a href='http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/jamie.vicary/'>Jamie Vicary</a> and Caspar Wylie. We haven&#8217;t quite got around to it yet, but <i>Globular</i> will be open-source, and we&#8217;re really keen for people to get involved and help build the software&#8212;there&#8217;s a huge amount to do!  If you want to help out, get in touch.</p>
<h3> Mathematical foundations</h3>
<p><i>Globular</i> is based on the theory of finitely-presented semistrict <i>n</i>-categories; at the moment, it works up to the level of 3-categories, with an extension to 4-categories actively in development. (You can build cells of any dimension, but from 4-cells and up, some structures are missing.)</p>
<p>Definitions of <i>n</i>-category vary in how strict they are; a definition is <i>semistrict</i> when it&#8217;s as strict as possible, while still having the property that every weak <i>n</i>-category satisfies it, up to equivalence. Definitions of semistrict <i>n</i>-category are not unique: in dimension 3, <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Gray-category"><i>Gray categories</i></a> put all the weak structure in the interchangers, while <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/10/semicategories.html"><i>Simpson snucategories</i></a> put it all in the unitors. Globular implements the axioms of a Gray category, because this is the most appropriate for the graphical calculus: the interchangers can be seen graphically, as changes in height of the components of the diagram. By the theory of <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/k-tuply+monoidal+n-category"><i>k</i>-tuply monoidal <i>n</i>-categories</a>, this also lets you build proofs in a monoidal category, or a braided monoidal category, or a monoidal 2-category.</p>
<p>The only things that <i>Globular</i> understands are <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" />-cells, for some value of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" />. So if you want to build an <i>n</i>-category where an equation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%3Dg&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f=g" class="latex" /> holds between <i>n</i>-cells, you have to do it by adding <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28n%2B1%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(n+1)" class="latex" />-cells <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3Af+%5Cto+g&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a:f &#92;to g" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b%3Ag+%5Cto+f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="b:g &#92;to f" class="latex" />. If you then build some composite <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C%28f%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C(f)" class="latex" /> involving <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" />, you can apply the cell <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a" class="latex" /> to obtain <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C%28g%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C(g)" class="latex" />, and we <i>interpret</i> this as the equation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C%28f%29+%3D+C%28g%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C(f) = C(g)" class="latex" />. In a slogan, this is <i>equality via rewriting</i>. This is consistent with the basic premise of homotopy type theory: treat your proofs as first-order structures, which can in turn be reasoned about themselves.</p>
<p><i>Globular</i> can also handle <i>invertibility</i> in a nice way. For a cell <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%3AA+%5Cto+B&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F:A &#92;to B" class="latex" /> to be invertible, indicated by ticking a box in the signature, means that there also exists an invertible cell <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%5E%7B-1%7D%3A+B+%5Cto+A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F^{-1}: B &#92;to A" class="latex" />, and invertible cells <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctext%7Bid%7D_A+%5Cto+F+.+F%5E%7B-1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;text{id}_A &#92;to F . F^{-1}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctext%7Bid%7D_B+%5Cto+F%5E%7B-1%7D+.+F&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;text{id}_B &#92;to F^{-1} . F" class="latex" />. This is a <i>coinductive</i> definition (see <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2011/07/coinductive_definitions.html">Mike Shulman&#8217;s nice post</a> on this topic), since we&#8217;re defining the notion of invertibility in terms of <i>itself</i> in a higher dimension. This sort of a definition is great for proof assistants to work with, as it allows a lot of structure to be generated from a single compact definition.</p>
<h3>How it works</h3>
<p><a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Globular">For a lot more details, take a look at the nLab page.</a> Everything that happens in <i>Globular</i> involves in interaction between the <i>signature</i> on the left-hand side, and the <i>diagram</i> in the main part of the screen. The signature stores the &#8216;library&#8217; of cells you have available, and the diagram is a particular composite of cells that you have constructed.</p>
<p>To construct a new diagram, clear whatever is currently displayed by clicking the &#8216;Clear&#8217; button on the right, or pressing &#8216;c&#8217;. Then start by clicking the icon of a <i>n</i>-cell in your signature, which will make a diagram consisting just of that cell. Clicking on the icons of other <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" />-generators for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0+%3C+k+%5Cleq+n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="0 &lt; k &#92;leq n" class="latex" /> will display a list of ways the cell can be <i>attached</i>, and when you choose one of these ways, the attachment will be performed, growing your <i>n</i>-diagram. (If you&#8217;re starting with a blank workspace you will only have a single 0-cell available, so you won&#8217;t be able to do this yet!) Clicking an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28n%2B1%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(n+1)" class="latex" />-cell <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="G" class="latex" /> displays a list of ways that your <i>n</i>-diagram <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="D" class="latex" /> can be <i>rewritten</i>, by identifying the source of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="G" class="latex" /> as a subdiagram of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="D" class="latex" />. Selecting one of these ways will implement the rewrite, by &#8216;cutting out&#8217; the chosen subdiagram of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="D" class="latex" />, and replacing it with the target of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="G" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>Another way to modify the diagram is to <i>click</i> directly on it. Clicking near the edge of the diagram performs an attachment, while clicking in the interior of the diagram performs a rewrite. If more than one attachment or rewrite is consistent with your click, a little menu will pop up for you to choose what you want to do. When you move your mouse pointer over the diagram, a little label pops up to show you what your cursor is hovering over, which is helpful when choosing where to click.</p>
<p>You can also <i>click-and-drag</i> on the diagram. This will attach or rewrite with an interchanger, or naturality for an interchanger, or invertibility for an interchanger, depending on where you have clicked and the direction of the drag. Clicking and dragging is designed to work as if you were really ‘touching’ the strings. So if you want to braid one strand over another, click the strand to ‘grab’ it, and ‘pull’ it to one side. If you want to pull a vertex through a braiding, click the vertex to ‘grab’ it, and ‘pull’ it up or down through its adjacent braiding. Of course, <i>Globular</i> will only carry out the command if the move you are attempting to make is actually valid in that location.</p>
<h3>Example theorems</h3>
<p>Here are four worked examples of nontrivial proofs in <i>Globular</i>:</p>
<p>• <i>Frobenius implies associative</i>: <a href="http://globular.science/1512.004">http://globular.science/1512.004</a>. In a monoidal category, if multiplication and comultiplication morphisms are unital, counital and Frobenius, then they are associative and coassociative.</p>
<p>• <i>Strengthening an equivalence</i>: <a href="http://globular.science/1512.007">http://globular.science/1512.007</a>. In a 2-category, an equivalence gives rise to an adjoint equivalence, satisfying the snake equations.</p>
<p>• <i>Swallowtail comes for free</i>: <a href="http://globular.science/1512.006">http://globular.science/1512.006</a>. In a monoidal 2-category, a weakly-dual pair of objects gives rise to a strongly-dual pair, satisfying the swallowtail equations.</p>
<p>• <i>Pentagon and triangle implies <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda_I+%3D+%5Crho_I&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;lambda_I = &#92;rho_I" class="latex" /></i>: <a href="http://globular.science/1512.002">http://globular.science/1512.002</a>. In a monoidal 2-category, if a pseudomonoid object satisfies pentagon and triangle equations, then it satisfies <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda_I+%3D+%5Crho_I&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;lambda_I = &#92;rho_I" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll focus on the second example project &#8220;Strengthening an equivalence&#8221; listed above, and see how it was constructed. This project investigates the factthat every equivalence in a 2-category gives rise to an <i>adjoint</i> equivalence. To start, we therefore need the basic data that exhibits an equivalence in a 2-category: two 0-cells <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B" class="latex" />, and an invertible 1-cell <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%3AA+%5Cto+B&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F:A &#92;to B" class="latex" />, by the weak definition of &#8216;invertible&#8217; discussed above. This gives us the following signature:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/37jayj0s419ncbx/Image1.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>The 2-cells that witness invertibility of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F" class="latex" /> look like cups and caps in the graphical calculus, but they won&#8217;t satisfy the snake equations that define an <i>adjoint</i> equivalence. The idea of this proof is to define a new cap, built out of the invertible structure of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F" class="latex" />, which <i>does</i> satisfy the snake equations with the existing cup.</p>
<p>By starting with a diagram consisting of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F" class="latex" /> alone, pressing &#8216;i&#8217; to take the identity diagram, and clicking-and-dragging, we build the following 2-diagram, out of the invertible structure associated to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F" class="latex" />:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/r5po4fk35kyfi9g/Image2.png" alt="" height="300" /></div>
<p>This is our candidate for our redefined cup. Its source is the identity on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" />, and its target is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F" class="latex" /> composed with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%5E%7B-1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F^{-1}" class="latex" />. It looks a bit like the curved end of a hockey stick.</p>
<p>To store it for later use, we now click the &#8216;Theorem&#8217; button. Writing <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="D" class="latex" /> for the 2-diagram we have constructed, this does two things. First, it creates a 2-cell generator that we call &#8220;New Cup&#8221;, whose source is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s%28D%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="s(D)" class="latex" />, and whose target is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t%28D%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="t(D)" class="latex" />. This is the redefined cup that we can use in future expressions. Second, it creates an invertible 3-cell generator that we call &#8220;New Cup Definition&#8221;, with source given by &#8220;New Cup&#8221;, and with target given by our hockey-stick diagram <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="D" class="latex" />. This says what &#8220;New Cup&#8221; <i>means</i> in terms of our original structure. This adds the following cells to our signature:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/9gl7jcccbnrt7hg/Image3.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>Because &#8220;New Cup Definition&#8221; is a 3-cell, by default we see two little icons: one for its source, and one for its target. See how its source is a little picture of &#8220;New Cup&#8221;, and its target is a little picture of the hockey stick, just as we defined it.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re now ready to prove one of the snake equations. We start by building the snake composite, using &#8220;New Cup&#8221; for the cup, and the invertible structure of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F" class="latex" /> for the cap:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/mj8gjmswe1cilsj/Image4.png" alt="" height="300" /></div>
<p>Now have to prove that this equals the identity. Since equality is implemented by rewriting, we must construct a 3-diagram whose source is this snake composite, and whose target is the identity on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F" class="latex" />. To start, we click the &#8216;Identity&#8217; button to convert our diagram into an identity 3-diagram. The only apparent effect this has is to add a number scroller to the &#8216;Slice&#8217; area of the controls in the top-right. At the moment we can set this to &#8216;0&#8217; and &#8216;1&#8217;, representing the source and target of our identity 3-diagram respectively. We set it to &#8216;1&#8217;, because we want to compose things to the target.</p>
<p>We now build up our proof. First, we click on the pink vertex that represents &#8220;New Cup&#8221;. This will attach our 3-cell &#8220;New Cup Definition&#8221;, replacing &#8220;New Cup&#8221; with our hockey-stick picture. By clicking-and-dragging on the diagram, we obtain the following sequence<br />

<p>Pictures 3 to 10 were created by attaching interchangers, and pictures 11 to 15 were created by attaching higher structure generated by the invertibility of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F" class="latex" />. In all cases, this structure was attached just by clicking-and-dragging on the appropriate vertices of the diagram. We&#8217;ve turned the snake into the identity, so we&#8217;ve finished our proof, which required 14 3-cells. By using the &#8216;Slice&#8217; control in the top-right, we can navigate through the 15 slices that make up our proof, and review what we just did. Even better, turning the &#8216;Project&#8217; control to the value &#8216;1&#8217; tells <i>Globular</i> to project out the lowest dimension. This means that our entire 3-diagram proof can be viewed as a <i>single</i> 2-dimensional diagram, as follows:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/31mojij6ayu4iq8/Image5.PNG" alt="" height="400" />
</div>
<p>This is just like the Morse singularity graphics used by topologists to study the structure of higher-dimensional manifolds. In this picture, the vertices are 3-cells, the lines are 2-cells, and the regions are 1-cells (in fact, every region is the 1-cell <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F" class="latex" />.) By moving your mouse pointer over the different parts of the diagram, you can see what the different components are. Interchangers are represented in this projection by braidings.</p>
<p>Now we can do something cool: we can <i>modify</i> our proof, by clicking-and-dragging on the Morse projection. For example, just to the right of centre, there is a crossing, out of which emerge two long vertical lines that travel up a long way before annihilating with one another. Our proof would be much simpler if these two lines just annihilated with each other right after the interchanger. So, we click the vertex at the top of the lines, and drag it down repeatedly, until it gets to where we want it:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/4htdxmuu6v7fb70/Image6.PNG" alt="" height="400" /></div>
<p>We&#8217;ve simplified our proof. By clicking-and-dragging some more, you can change the proof in lots of different ways, although you probably won&#8217;t get it much simpler than this. Putting the &#8216;Project&#8217; control back to &#8216;0&#8217;, and navigating through the stages of the proof with the &#8216;Slice&#8217; control as we were doing before, we can see that our proof has indeed been modified.</p>
<p>This project has been in development for about 18 months, so it feels great to finally launch. We hope the whole community will get clicking-and-dragging, and let us know how easy it is to use, and what other features would be useful. There are certain to still be bugs, so let us know about them too, and we&#8217;ll get right on them.</p>

					<p>Here at the Simons Institute <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2016/11/01/compositionality-workshop/">workshop on compositionality</a>, my <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2016/11/29/compositionality-in-network-theory/">talk on network theory</a> explained how to use &#8216;decorated cospans&#8217; as a general model of open systems.  These were invented by Brendan Fong, and are nicely explained in his thesis:</p>
<p>• Brendan Fong, <i><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05382">The Algebra of Open and Interconnected Systems</a></i>.  (Blog article <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2016/10/23/open-and-interconnected-systems/">here</a>.)</p>
<p>But he went further: to understand the <em>externally observable behavior</em> of an open system we often want to simplify a decorated cospan and get another sort of structure, which he calls a &#8216;decorated corelation&#8217;.</p>
<p>In this talk, Brendan explained decorated corelations and what they&#8217;re good for:</p>

<blockquote><p>
  <strong>Abstract.</strong> Hypergraph categories are monoidal categories in which every object is equipped with a special commutative Frobenius monoid. Morphisms in a hypergraph category can hence be represented by string diagrams in which strings can branch and split: diagrams that are reminiscent of electrical circuit diagrams. As such they provide a framework for formalising the syntax and semantics of circuit-type diagrammatic languages. In this talk I will introduce decorated corelations as a tool for building hypergraph categories and hypergraph functors, drawing examples from linear algebra and dynamical systems.

				<small>7 December, 2016</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>I once complained that my student Brendan Fong said ‘semantics’ too much. You see, I’m in a math department, but he was actually in the computer science department at Oxford: I was his informal supervisor. Theoretical computer scientists love talking about syntax versus semantics—that is, written expressions versus what those expressions actually <i>mean</i>, or programs versus what those programs actually <i>do</i>. So Brendan was very comfortable with that distinction. But my other grad students, coming from a math department didn’t understand it&#8230; and he was mentioning it in practically ever other sentence.</p>
<p>In 1963, in his PhD thesis, <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Functorial+Semantics+of+Algebraic+Theories">Bill Lawvere</a> figured out a way to talk about syntax versus semantics that even mathematicians—well, even category theorists—could understand. It’s called ‘functorial semantics’.  The idea is that things you write are morphisms in some category <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X," class="latex" /> while their meanings are morphisms in some other category <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Y." class="latex" />   There&#8217;s a functor <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F+%5Ccolon+X+%5Cto+Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F &#92;colon X &#92;to Y" class="latex" /> which sends things you write to their meanings.  This functor sends <em>syntax</em> to <em>semantics!</em></p>
<p>But physicists may not enjoy this idea unless they see it at work in physics. In physics, too, the distinction is important!  But it takes a while to understand. I hope Prakash Panangaden&#8217;s talk at the start of the Simons Institute <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2016/11/01/compositionality-workshop/">workshop on compositionality</a> is helpful.

<blockquote><p>
  <strong>Abstract.</strong> To describe systems composed of interacting parts, scientists and engineers draw diagrams of networks: flow charts, Petri nets, electrical circuit diagrams, signal-flow graphs, chemical reaction networks, Feynman diagrams and the like. In principle all these different diagrams fit into a common framework: the mathematics of symmetric monoidal categories. This has been known for some time. However, the details are more challenging, and ultimately more rewarding, than this basic insight. Two complementary approaches are presentations of symmetric monoidal categories using generators and relations (which are more algebraic in flavor) and decorated cospan categories (which are more geometrical). In this talk we focus on the latter.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This talk assumes considerable familiarity with category theory.  For a much gentler talk on the same theme, see:</p>

					<p>Here are the slides of my <a href="http://www.santafe.edu/gevent/colloquia/?start=2016-11-15">colloquium talk</a> at the Santa Fe Institute at 11 am on Tuesday, November 15th.   I&#8217;ll explain some not-yet-published work with <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Blake_Pollard">Blake Pollard</a> on a monoidal category of &#8216;open Petri nets&#8217;:</p>
<p>• <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks_santa_fe/networks_santa_fe.pdf">Monoidal categories of networks</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Nature and the world of human technology are full of networks. People like to draw diagrams of networks: flow charts, electrical circuit diagrams, chemical reaction networks, signal-flow graphs, Bayesian networks, food webs, Feynman diagrams and the like. Far from mere informal tools, many of these diagrammatic languages fit into a rigorous framework: category theory. I will explain a bit of how this works and discuss some applications.
</p></blockquote>
<p>There I will be using the vaguer, less scary title &#8216;The mathematics of networks&#8217;.  In fact, all the monoidal categories I discuss are symmetric monoidal, but I decided that too many definitions will make people unhappy.</p>
<p>The main new thing in this talk is my work with Blake Pollard on symmetric monoidal categories where the morphisms are &#8216;open Petri nets&#8217;. This allows us to describe &#8216;open&#8217; chemical reactions, where chemical flow in and out.  Composing these morphisms then corresponds to sticking together open Petri nets to form larger open Petri nets.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m excited!   In early December I&#8217;m going to a workshop on &#8216;compositionality&#8217;, meaning how big complex things can be built by sticking together smaller, simpler parts:</p>
<p>• <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/workshops/schedule/3440">Compositionality</a>, 5-9 December 2016, workshop at the <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/">Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing</a>, Berkeley.  Organized by Samson Abramsky, Lucien Hardy and Michael Mislove.</p>
<p>In 2007 Jim Simons, the guy who helped invent Chern–Simons theory and then went on to make billions using math to run a hedge fund, founded a research center for geometry and physics on Long Island.   More recently he&#8217;s also set up this institute for theoretical computer science, in Berkeley.  I&#8217;ve never been there before.</p>
<p>&#8216;Compositionality&#8217; sounds like an incredibly broad topic, but since it&#8217;s part of a semester-long program on <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/logic2016">Logical structures in computation</a>, this workshop will be aimed at theoretical computer scientists, who have specific ideas about compositionality.  And these theoretical computer scientists tend to like category theory.  After all, category theory is about morphisms, which you can compose.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the idea:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The compositional description of complex objects is a fundamental feature of the logical structure of computation. The use of logical languages in database theory and in algorithmic and finite model theory provides a basic level of compositionality, but establishing systematic relationships between compositional descriptions and complexity remains elusive. Compositional models of probabilistic systems and languages have been developed, but inferring probabilistic properties of systems in a compositional fashion is an important challenge. In quantum computation, the phenomenon of entanglement poses a challenge at a fundamental level to the scope of compositional descriptions. At the same time, compositionally has been proposed as a fundamental principle for the development of physical theories. This workshop will focus on the common structures and methods centered on compositionality that run through all these areas.
</p></blockquote>
<p>So, some physics and quantum computation will get into the mix!</p>
<p>A lot of people working on categories and computation will be at this workshop.  Here&#8217;s what I know about the talks so far.  If you click on the talk titles you&#8217;ll get abstracts, at least for most of them.</p>

<p>This material is close to my heart, since I&#8217;ve informally served as Brendan&#8217;s advisor since 2011, when he came to Singapore to work with me on chemical reaction networks.  We&#8217;ve been collaborating intensely ever since.  I just looked at our correspondence, and I see it consists of 880 emails!</p>
<p>At some point I gave him a project: <i>describe the category whose morphisms are electrical circuits</i>.  He took up the challenge much more ambitiously than I&#8217;d ever expected, developing powerful general frameworks to solve not only this problem but also many others.  He did this in a number of papers, most of which I&#8217;ve already discussed:</p>

<p>But Brendan&#8217;s thesis is the best place to see a lot of this material in one place, integrated and clearly explained.</p>
<p>I wanted to write a summary of his thesis.  But since he did that himself very nicely in the preface, I&#8217;m going to be lazy and just quote that!   (I&#8217;ll leave out the references, which are crucial in scholarly prose but a bit off-putting in a blog.)</p>
<h3> Preface </h3>
<p>This is a thesis in the mathematical sciences, with emphasis on the mathematics. But before we get to the category theory, I want to say a few words about the scientific tradition in which this thesis is situated.</p>
<p>Mathematics is the language of science. Twinned so intimately with physics, over the past centuries mathematics has become a superb&#8212;indeed, unreasonably effective&#8212;language for understanding planets moving in space, particles in a vacuum, the structure of spacetime, and so on.  Yet, while Wigner speaks of the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences, equally eminent mathematicians, not least Gelfand, speak of the unreasonable <i>ineffectiveness</i> of mathematics in biology and related fields. Why such a difference?</p>
<p>A contrast between physics and biology is that while physical systems can often be studied in isolation&#8212;the proverbial particle in a vacuum&#8212;biological systems are necessarily situated in their environment. A heart belongs in a body, an ant in a colony. One of the first to draw attention to this contrast was Ludwig von Bertalanffy, biologist and founder of general systems theory, who articulated the difference as one between closed and open systems:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Conventional physics deals only with closed systems, i.e. systems which are considered to be isolated from their environment. [&#8230;] However, we find systems which by their very nature and definition are not closed systems.  Every living organism is essentially an open system. It maintains itself in a continuous inflow and outflow, a building up and breaking down of components, never being, so long as it is alive, in a state of chemical and thermodynamic equilibrium but maintained in a so-called &#8216;steady state&#8217; which is distinct from the latter.
</p></blockquote>
<p>While the ambitious generality of general systems theory has proved difficult, von Bertalanffy&#8217;s philosophy has had great impact in his home field of biology, leading to the modern field of systems biology. Half a century later, Dennis Noble, another great pioneer of systems biology and the originator of the first mathematical model of a working heart, describes the shift as one from reduction to integration.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Systems biology [&#8230;] is about putting together rather than taking apart, integration rather than reduction. It requires that we develop ways of thinking about integration that are as rigorous as our reductionist programmes, but different. It means changing our philosophy, in the full sense of the term.
</p></blockquote>
<p>In this thesis we develop rigorous ways of thinking about integration or, as we refer to it, interconnection.</p>
<p>Interconnection and openness are tightly related. Indeed, openness implies that a system may be interconnected with its environment. But what is an environment but comprised of other systems? Thus the study of open systems becomes the study of how a system changes under interconnection with other systems.</p>
<p>To model this, we must begin by creating language to describe theinterconnection of systems. While reductionism hopes that phenomena can be explained by reducing them to &#8220;elementary units investigable independently of each other&#8221; (in the words of von Bertalanffy), this philosophy of integration introduces as an additional and equal priority the investigation of the way these units are interconnected. As such, this thesis is predicated on the hope that the meaning of an expression in our new language is determined by the meanings of its constituent expressions together with the syntactic rules combining them. This is known as the principle of compositionality.</p>
<p>Also commonly known as Frege&#8217;s principle, the principle of compositionality both dates back to Ancient Greek and Vedic philosophy, and is still the subject of active research today. More recently, through the work of Montague in natural language semantics and Strachey and Scott in programming language semantics, the principle of compositionality has found formal expression as the dictum that the interpretation of a language should be given by a homomorphism from an algebra of syntactic representations to an algebra of semantic objects. We too shall follow this route.</p>
<p>The question then arises: what do we mean by algebra? This mathematical question leads us back to our scientific objectives: what do we mean by system? Here we must narrow, or at least define, our scope. We give some examples. The investigations of this thesis began with electrical circuits and their diagrams, and we will devote significant time to exploring their compositional formulation. We discussed biological systems above, and our notion of system includes these, modelled say in the form of chemical reaction networks or Markov processes, or the compartmental models of epidemiology, population biology, and ecology. From computer science, we consider Petri nets, automata, logic circuits, and the like.  More abstractly, our notion of system encompasses matrices and systems of differential equations.</p>
<p>Drawing together these notions of system are well-developed diagrammatic representations based on network diagrams&#8212; that is, topological graphs. We call these network-style diagrammatic languages. In abstract, by &#8216;system&#8217; we shall simply mean that which can be represented by a box with a collection of terminals, perhaps of different types, through which it interfaces with the surroundings. Concretely, one might envision a circuit diagram with terminals, such as</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="270" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/circuit_fong_5.jpg" />
</div>
<p>or</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="400" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/circuit_fong_6.jpg" />
</div>
<p>The algebraic structure of interconnection is then simply the structure that results from the ability to connect terminals of one system with terminals of another. This graphical approach motivates our language of interconnection: indeed, these diagrams will be the expressions of our language.</p>
<p>We claim that the existence of a network-style diagrammatic language to represent a system implies that interconnection is inherently important in understanding the system. Yet, while each of these example notions of system are well-studied in and of themselves, their compositional, or algebraic, structure has received scant attention. In this thesis, we study an algebraic structure called a &#8216;hypergraph category&#8217;, and argue that this is the relevant algebraic structure for modelling interconnection of open systems.</p>
<p>Given these pre-existing diagrammatic formalisms and our visual intuition, constructing algebras of syntactic representations is thus rather straightforward. The semantics and their algebraic structure are more subtle.</p>
<p>In some sense our semantics is already given to us too: in studying these systems as closed systems, scientists have already formalised the meaning of these diagrams. But we have shifted from a closed perspective to an open one, and we need our semantics to also account for points of interconnection.</p>
<p>Taking inspiration from Willems&#8217; behavioural approach and Deutsch&#8217;s constructor theory, in this thesis I advocate the following position. First, at each terminal of an open system we may make measurements appropriate to the type of terminal. Given a collection of terminals, the <b>universum</b> is then the set of all possible measurement outcomes. Each open system has a collection of terminals, and hence a universum. The semantics of an open system is the subset of measurement outcomes on the terminals that are permitted by the system. This is known as the <b>behaviour</b> of the system.</p>
<p>For example, consider a resistor of resistance <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r." class="latex" /> This has two terminals&#8212;the two ends of the resistor&#8212;and at each terminal, we may measure the potential and the current. Thus the universum of this system is the set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Coplus%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Coplus%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Coplus%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}&#92;oplus&#92;mathbb{R}&#92;oplus&#92;mathbb{R}&#92;oplus&#92;mathbb{R}," class="latex" /> where the summands represent respectively the potentials and currents at each of the two terminals. The resistor is governed by Kirchhoff&#8217;s current law, or conservation of charge,<br />
and Ohm&#8217;s law.  Conservation of charge states that the current flowing into one terminal must equal the current flowing out of the other terminal, while Ohm&#8217;s law states that this current will be proportional to the potential difference, with constant of proportionality <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2Fr.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="1/r." class="latex" /> Thus the behaviour of the resistor is the set</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+++%5Cbig%5C%7B%5Cbig%28%5Cphi_1%2C%5Cphi_2%2C+++++-%5Ctfrac1r%28%5Cphi_2-%5Cphi_1%29%2C%5Ctfrac1r%28%5Cphi_2-%5Cphi_1%29%5Cbig%29%5C%2C%5Cbig%5Cvert%5C%2C+++++%5Cphi_1%2C%5Cphi_2+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Cbig%5C%7D+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{   &#92;big&#92;{&#92;big(&#92;phi_1,&#92;phi_2,     -&#92;tfrac1r(&#92;phi_2-&#92;phi_1),&#92;tfrac1r(&#92;phi_2-&#92;phi_1)&#92;big)&#92;,&#92;big&#92;vert&#92;,     &#92;phi_1,&#92;phi_2 &#92;in &#92;mathbb{R}&#92;big&#92;} } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Note that in this perspective a law such as Ohm&#8217;s law is a mechanism for partitioning <i>behaviours</i> into possible and impossible behaviours.</p>
<p>Interconnection of terminals then asserts the identification of the variables at the identified terminals. Fixing some notion of open system and subsequently an algebra of syntactic representations for these systems, our approach, based on the principle of compositionality, requires this to define an algebra of semantic objects and a homomorphism from syntax to semantics. The first part of this thesis develops the mathematical tools necessary to pursue this vision for modelling open systems and their interconnection.</p>
<p>The next goal is to demonstrate the efficacy of this philosophy in applications.  At core, this work is done in the faith that the right language allows deeper insight into the underlying structure. Indeed, after setting up such a language for open systems there are many questions to be asked: Can we find a sound and complete logic for determining when two syntactic expressions have the same semantics? Suppose we have systems that have some property, for example controllability.  In what ways can we interconnect controllable systems so that the combined system is also controllable? Can we compute the semantics of a large system quicker by computing the semantics of subsystems and then composing them?  If I want a given system to achieve a specified trajectory, can we interconnect another system to make it do so? How do two different notions of system, such as circuit diagrams and signal flow graphs, relate to each other? Can we find homomorphisms between their syntactic and semantic algebras? In the second part of this thesis we explore some applications in depth, providing answers to questions of the above sort.</p>
<h3>Outline of the thesis</h3>
<p>The thesis is divided into two parts. Part I, comprising<br />
Chapters 1 to 4, focuses on mathematical foundations. In it we develop the theory of hypergraph categories and a powerful tool for constructing and manipulating them: decorated corelations. Part II, comprising Chapters 5 to 7, then discusses applications of this theory to examples of open systems.</p>
<p>The central refrain of this thesis is that the syntax and semantics of network-style diagrammatic languages can be modelled by hypergraph categories. These are introduced in Chapter 1.  <b>Hypergraph categories</b> are symmetric monoidal categories in which every object is equipped with the structure of a special commutative Frobenius monoid in a way compatible with the monoidal product. As we will rely heavily on properties of monoidal categories, their functors, and their graphical calculus, we begin with a whirlwind review of these ideas. We then provide a definition of hypergraph categories and their functors, a strictification theorem, and an important example: the category of cospans in a category with finite colimits.</p>
<p>A <b>cospan</b> is a pair of morphisms</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X+%5Cto+N+%5Cleftarrow+Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X &#92;to N &#92;leftarrow Y" class="latex" /></p>
<p>with a common codomain.  In Chapter 2 we introduce the idea of a &#8216;decorated cospan&#8217;, which equips the apex <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="N" class="latex" /> with extra structure. Our motivating example is cospans of finite sets decorated by labeled graphs, as in this picture:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="90%" height="90%" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/decorated_cospans/labelled_graph_as_cospan_1.jpg" />
</div>
<p>Here graphs are a proxy for expressions in a network-style diagrammatic language. To give a bit more formal detail, let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal+C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathcal C" class="latex" /> be a category with finite colimits, writing its as coproduct as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%2B%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="+," class="latex" /> and let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5Cmathcal+D%2C+%5Cotimes%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(&#92;mathcal D, &#92;otimes)" class="latex" /> be a braided monoidal category. Decorated cospans provide a method of producing a hypergraph category from a lax braided monoidal functor</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%5Ccolon+%28%5Cmathcal+C%2C%2B%29+%5Cto+%28%5Cmathcal+D%2C+%5Cotimes%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F&#92;colon (&#92;mathcal C,+) &#92;to (&#92;mathcal D, &#92;otimes)" class="latex" /></p>
<p>The objects of these categories are simply the objects of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal+C%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathcal C," class="latex" /> while the morphisms are pairs comprising a cospan <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X+%5Crightarrow+N+%5Cleftarrow+Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X &#92;rightarrow N &#92;leftarrow Y" class="latex" /> in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal+C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathcal C" class="latex" /> together with an element <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I+%5Cto+FN&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="I &#92;to FN" class="latex" /> in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal+D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathcal D" class="latex" />&#8212;the so-called <b>decoration</b>. We will also describe how to construct hypergraph functors between decorated cospan categories. In particular, this provides a useful tool for constructing a hypergraph category that captures the syntax of a network-style diagrammatic language.</p>
<p>Having developed a method to construct a category where the morphisms are expressions in a diagrammatic language, we turn our attention to categories of semantics. This leads us to the notion of a corelation, to which we devote Chapter 3. Given a factorisation system <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5Cmathcal%7BE%7D%2C%5Cmathcal%7BM%7D%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(&#92;mathcal{E},&#92;mathcal{M})" class="latex" /> on a category <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathcal{C}," class="latex" /> we define a <b>corelation</b> to be a cospan <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X+%5Cto+N+%5Cleftarrow+Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X &#92;to N &#92;leftarrow Y" class="latex" /> such that the copairing of the two maps, a map <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X%2BY+%5Cto+N%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X+Y &#92;to N," class="latex" /> is a morphism in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BE%7D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathcal{E}." class="latex" /> Factorising maps <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X%2BY+%5Cto+N&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X+Y &#92;to N" class="latex" /> using the factorisation system leads to a notion of equivalence on cospans, and this helps us describe when two diagrams are equivalent. Like cospans, corelations form hypergraph categories.</p>
<p>In Chapter 4 we decorate corelations. Like decorated cospans,<br />
decorated corelations are corelations together with some additional structure on the apex. We again use a lax braided monoidal functor to specify the sorts of extra structure allowed. Moreover, decorated corelations too form the morphisms of a hypergraph category. The culmination of our theoretical work is to show that every hypergraph category and every hypergraph functor can be constructe using decorated corelations. This implies that we can use decorated corelations to construct a semantic hypergraph category for any network-style diagrammatic language, as well as a hypergraph functor from its syntactic category that interprets each diagram. We also discuss how the intuitions behind decorated corelations guide construction of these categories and functors.</p>
<p>Having developed these theoretical tools, in the second part we turn to demonstrating that they have useful applications. Chapter 5 uses corelations to formalise signal flow diagrams representing linear time-invariant discrete dynamical systems as morphisms in a category. Our main result gives an intuitive sound and fully complete equational theory for reasoning about these linear time-invariant systems. Using this framework, we derive a novel structural characterisation of controllability, and consequently provide a methodology for analysing controllability of networked and interconnected systems.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 studies passive linear networks. Passive linear networks are used in a wide variety of engineering applications, but the best studied are electrical circuits made of resistors, inductors and capacitors. The goal is to construct what we call the &#8216;black box functor&#8217;, a hypergraph functor from a category of open circuit diagrams to a category of behaviours of circuits. We construct the former as a decorated cospan category, with each morphism a cospan of finite sets decorated by a circuit diagram on the apex. In this category, composition describes the process of attaching the outputs of one circuit to the inputs of another. The behaviour of a circuit is the relation it imposes between currents and potentials at their terminals. The space of these currents and potentials naturally has the structure of a symplectic vector space, and the relation imposed by a circuit is a Lagrangian linear relation. Thus, the black box functor goes from our category of circuits to the category of symplectic vector spaces and Lagrangian linear relations. Decorated corelations provide a critical tool for constructing these hypergraph categories and the black box functor.</p>
<p>Finally, in Chapter 7 we mention two further research directions. The first is the idea of a &#8216;bound colimit&#8217;, which aims to describe why epi-mono factorisation systems are useful for constructing corelation categories of semantics for open systems. The second research direction pertains to applications of the black box functor for passive linear networks, discussing the work of Jekel on the inverse problem for electric circuits and the work of Baez, Fong, and Pollard on open Markov processes.</p>

				<h2><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2016/10/02/complex-adaptive-system-design-part-1/" rel="bookmark">Complex Adaptive System Design (Part&nbsp;1)</a></h2>
				<small>2 October, 2016</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>In January of this year, I was contacted by a company called <a href="http://www.metsci.com/">Metron Scientific Solutions</a>.  They asked if I&#8217;d like to join them in a project to use category theory to design and evaluate complex, adaptive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_systems">systems of systems</a>.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s a &#8216;system of systems&#8217;?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a system made of many disparate parts, each of which is a complex system in its own right.  The biosphere is a system of systems.  But so far, people usually use this buzzword for large human-engineered systems where the different components are made by different organizations, perhaps over a long period of time, with changing and/or incompatible standards.   This makes it impossible to fine-tune everything in a top-down way and have everything fit together seamlessly.</p>
<p>So, systems of systems are inherently messy.  And yet we need them.</p>
<p>Metron was applying for a grant from <strong>DARPA</strong>, the <a href="http://www.darpa.mil/">Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</a>, which funds a lot of cutting-edge research for the US military.  It may seem surprising that DARPA is explicitly interested in using <i>category theory</i> to study systems of systems.  But it actually shouldn&#8217;t be surprising: their mission is to try many things and find a few that work.   They are willing to take risks.</p>
<p>Metron was applying for a grant under a DARPA program run by <a href="http://www.darpa.mil/staff/dr-john-s-paschkewitz">John S. Paschkewitz</a>, who is interested in</p>
<blockquote><p>
  new paradigms and foundational approaches for the design of complex systems and system-of-systems (SoS) architectures.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This program is called <strong>CASCADE</strong>, short for <a href="http://www.darpa.mil/program/complex-adaptive-system-composition-and-design-environment">Complex Adaptive System Composition and Design Environment</a>.   Here&#8217;s the idea:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Complex interconnected systems are increasingly becoming part of everyday life in both military and civilian environments. In the military domain, air-dominance system-of-systems concepts, such as those being developed under DARPA’s SoSITE effort, envision manned and unmanned aircraft linked by networks that seamlessly share data and resources in real time. In civilian settings such as urban “smart cities”, critical infrastructure systems—water, power, transportation, communications and cyber—are similarly integrated within complex networks. Dynamic systems such as these promise capabilities that are greater than the mere sum of their parts, as well as enhanced resilience when challenged by adversaries or natural disasters. But they are difficult to model and cannot be systematically designed using today’s tools, which are simply not up to the task of assessing and predicting the complex interactions among system structures and behaviors that constantly change across time and space.</p>
<p>To overcome this challenge, DARPA has announced the Complex Adaptive System Composition and Design Environment (CASCADE) program. The goal of CASCADE is to advance and exploit novel mathematical techniques able to provide a deeper understanding of system component interactions and a unified view of system behaviors. The program also aims to develop a formal language for composing and designing complex adaptive systems. A special notice announcing a Proposers Day on Dec. 9, 2015, was released today on FedBizOpps here: <a href="http://go.usa.gov/cT7uR" rel="nofollow">http://go.usa.gov/cT7uR</a>.</p>
<p>“CASCADE aims to fundamentally change how we design systems for real-time resilient response within dynamic, unexpected environments,” said John Paschkewitz, DARPA program manager. “Existing modeling and design tools invoke static ‘playbook’ concepts that don’t adequately represent the complexity of, say, an airborne system of systems with its constantly changing variables, such as enemy jamming, bad weather, or loss of one or more aircraft. As another example, this program could inform the design of future forward-deployed military surgical capabilities by making sure the functions, structures, behaviors and constraints of the medical system—such as surgeons, helicopters, communication networks, transportation, time, and blood supply—are accurately modeled and understood.”</p>
<p>CASCADE could also help the Department of Defense fulfill its role of providing humanitarian assistance in response to a devastating earthquake, hurricane or other catastrophe, by developing comprehensive response models that account for the many components and interactions inherent in such missions, whether in urban or austere environs.</p>
<p>“We need new design and representation tools to ensure resilience of buildings, electricity, drinking water supply, healthcare, roads and sanitation when disaster strikes,” Paschkewitz said. “CASCADE could help develop models that would provide civil authorities, first responders and assisting military commanders with the sequence and timing of critical actions they need to take for saving lives and restoring critical infrastructure. In the stress following a major disaster, models that could do that would be invaluable.”</p>
<p>The CASCADE program seeks expertise in the following areas:</p>
<p>&bull; Applied mathematics, especially in category theory, algebraic geometry and topology, and sheaf theory</p>
<p>&bull; Operations research, control theory and planning, especially in stochastic and non-linear control</p>
<p>&bull; Modeling and applications responsive to challenges in battlefield medicine logistics and platforms, adaptive logistics, reliability, and maintenance</p>
<p>&bull; Search and rescue platforms and modeling</p>
<p>&bull; Adaptive and resilient urban infrastructure</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Metron already designs systems of systems used in Coast Guard search and rescue missions.  Their grant proposal was to use category theory and <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2016/07/13/operads-for-systems-of-systems/">operads</a> to do this better.  They needed an academic mathematician as part of their team: that was one of the program&#8217;s requirements.  So they asked if I was interested.</p>
<p>I had mixed feelings.</p>
<p>On the one hand, I come from a line of peaceniks including Joan Baez, Mimi Fari&ntilde;a, their father the physicist Albert Baez, and my parents.   I don&#8217;t like how the US government puts so much energy into fighting wars rather than solving our economic, social and environmental problems.  It&#8217;s interesting that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_systems_engineering">&#8216;systems of systems engineering&#8217;</a>, as a field, is so heavily dominated by the US military.  It&#8217;s an important subject that could be useful in many ways.  We need it for better energy grids, better adaptation to climate change, and so on.   I dream of using it to develop &#8216;ecotechnology&#8217;: technology that works <em>with</em> nature instead of trying to battle it and defeat it.  But it seems the US doesn&#8217;t have the money, or the risk-taking spirit, to fund applications of category theory to <em>those</em> subjects.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I was attracted by the prospect of using category theory to design complex adaptive systems&#8212;and using it not just to tackle foundational issues, but also concrete challenges.  I liked the idea of working with a team of people who are more practical than me.   In this project, a big part of my job would be to write and publish papers: that&#8217;s something I can do.  But Metron had other people who would try to create prototypes of software for helping the Coast Guard design search and rescue missions.</p>
<p>So I was torn.</p>
<p>In fact, because of my qualms, I&#8217;d already turned down an offer from another company that was writing a proposal for the CASCADE program.  But the Metron project seemed slightly more attractive&#8212;I&#8217;m not sure why, perhaps because it was described to me in a more concrete way.  And unlike that other company, Metron has a large existing body of software for evaluating complex systems, which should help me focus my theoretical ideas.  The interaction between theory and practice can make theory a lot more interesting.</p>
<p>Something tipped the scales and I said yes.  We applied for the grant, and we got it.</p>
<p>And so, an interesting adventure began.  It will last for 3 years, and I&#8217;ll say more about it soon.</p>

				<h2><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2016/09/25/struggles-with-the-continuum-part-8/" rel="bookmark">Struggles with the Continuum (Part&nbsp;8)</a></h2>
				<small>25 September, 2016</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>We&#8217;ve been looking at how the continuum nature of spacetime poses problems for our favorite theories of physics&#8212;problems with infinities. <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2016/09/23/struggles-with-the-continuum-part-7/">Last time</a> we saw a great example: general relativity predicts the existence of <em>singularities</em>, like black holes and the Big Bang. I explained exactly what these singularities really are. They&#8217;re not points or regions of spacetime! They&#8217;re more like ways for a particle to &#8216;fall off the edge of spacetime&#8217;. Technically, they are incomplete timelike or null geodesics.</p>
<p>The next step is to ask whether these singularities rob general relativity of its predictive power. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_censorship_hypothesis">&#8216;cosmic censorship hypothesis&#8217;</a>, proposed by Penrose in 1969, claims they do not.</p>
<p>In this final post I&#8217;ll talk about cosmic censorship, and conclude with some big questions&#8230; and a place where you can get all these posts in a single file.</p>
<h3>Cosmic censorship</h3>
<p>To say what we want to rule out, we must first think about what behaviors we consider acceptable. Consider first a black hole formed by the collapse of a star. According to general relativity, matter can fall into this black hole and &#8216;hit the singularity&#8217; in a finite amount of proper time, but nothing can come out of the singularity.</p>
<p>The time-reversed version of a black hole, called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_hole">&#8216;white hole&#8217;</a>, is often considered more disturbing. White holes have never been seen, but they are mathematically valid solutions of Einstein&#8217;s equation. In a white hole, matter can come <em>out</em> of the singularity, but nothing can fall <em>in</em>. Naively, this seems to imply that the future is unpredictable given knowledge of the past. Of course, the same logic applied to black holes would say the past is unpredictable given knowledge of the future.</p>
<div align="center">
<img class="size-full wp-image-10732" src="https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/big_bang.jpg" alt="Big Bang Cosmology" width="450" /> </p>
<p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:CMB_Timeline300_no_WMAP.jpg">Big Bang cosmology</a>
</div>
<p>If white holes are disturbing, perhaps the Big Bang should be more so. In the usual solutions of general relativity describing the Big Bang, <em>all matter in the universe</em> comes out of a singularity! More precisely, if one follows any timelike geodesic back into the past, it becomes undefined after a finite amount of proper time. Naively, this may seem a massive violation of predictability: in this scenario, the whole universe &#8216;sprang out of nothing&#8217; about 14 billion years ago.</p>
<p>However, in all three examples so far&#8212;astrophysical black holes, their time-reversed versions and the Big Bang&#8212;spacetime is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globally_hyperbolic_manifold">globally hyperbolic</a>. I explained what this means last time. In simple terms, it means we can specify initial data at one moment in time and use the laws of physics to predict the future (and past) throughout all of spacetime. How is this compatible with the naive intuition that a singularity causes a failure of predictability?</p>
<p>For any globally hyperbolic spacetime <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="M," class="latex" /> one can find a smoothly varying family of Cauchy surfaces <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S_t" class="latex" /> (<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="t &#92;in &#92;mathbb{R}" class="latex" />) such that each point of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="M" class="latex" /> lies on exactly one of these surfaces. This amounts to a way of chopping spacetime into &#8216;slices of space&#8217; for various choices of the &#8216;time&#8217; parameter <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="t." class="latex" /> For an astrophysical black hole, the singularity is in the future of all these surfaces. That is, an incomplete timelike or null geodesic must go through all these surfaces <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S_t" class="latex" /> before it becomes undefined. Similarly, for a white hole or the Big Bang, the singularity is in the past of all these surfaces. In either case, the singularity cannot interfere with our predictions of what occurs in spacetime.</p>
<p>A more challenging example is posed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerr%E2%80%93Newman_metric">Kerr&#8211;Newman solution</a> of Einstein&#8217;s equation coupled to the vacuum Maxwell equations. When</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e%5E2+%2B+%28J%2Fm%29%5E2+%3C+m%5E2+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="e^2 + (J/m)^2 &lt; m^2 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>this solution describes a rotating charged black hole with mass <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="m," class="latex" /> charge <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="e" class="latex" /> and angular momentum <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=J&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="J" class="latex" /> in units where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+%3D+G+%3D+1.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c = G = 1." class="latex" />   However, an electron violates this inequality.   In 1968, Brandon Carter pointed out that if the electron were described by the Kerr&#8211;Newman solution, it would have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyromagnetic_ratio">gyromagnetic ratio</a> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g+%3D+2%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="g = 2," class="latex" /> much closer to the true answer than a classical spinning sphere of charge, which gives <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g+%3D+1.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="g = 1." class="latex" />  But since</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e%5E2+%2B+%28J%2Fm%29%5E2+%3E+m%5E2+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="e^2 + (J/m)^2 &gt; m^2 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>this solution gives a spacetime that is not globally hyperbolic: it has closed timelike curves! It also contains a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_singularity">&#8216;naked singularity&#8217;</a>. Roughly speaking, this is a singularity that can be seen by arbitrarily faraway observers in a spacetime whose geometry asymptotically approaches that of Minkowski spacetime. The existence of a naked singularity implies a failure of global hyperbolicity.</p>
<p>The cosmic censorship hypothesis comes in a number of forms. The original version due to Penrose is now called <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9710068">&#8216;weak cosmic censorship&#8217;</a>. It asserts that in a spacetime whose geometry asymptotically approaches that of Minkowski spacetime, gravitational collapse cannot produce a naked singularity.</p>
<p>In 1991, Preskill and Thorne made <a href="http://www.theory.caltech.edu/people/preskill/old_naked_bet.html">a bet</a> against Hawking in which they claimed that weak cosmic censorship was false. Hawking conceded this bet in 1997 when a counterexample was found. This features finely-tuned infalling matter poised right on the brink of forming a black hole. It <em>almost</em> creates a region from which light cannot escape&#8212;but not quite. Instead, it creates a naked singularity!</p>
<p>Given the delicate nature of this construction, Hawking did not give up. Instead he made <a href="http://www.theory.caltech.edu/people/preskill/new_naked_bet.html">a second bet</a>, which says that weak cosmic censorshop holds &#8216;generically&#8217; &#8212; that is, for an open dense set of initial conditions.</p>
<p>In 1999, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/math/9901147">Christodoulou proved</a> that for spherically symmetric solutions of Einstein&#8217;s equation coupled to a massless scalar field, weak cosmic censorship holds generically. While spherical symmetry is a very restrictive assumption, this result is a good example of how, with plenty of work, we can make progress in rigorously settling the questions raised by general relativity.</p>
<p>Indeed, Christodoulou has been a leader in this area. For example, the vacuum Einstein equations have solutions describing gravitational waves, much as the vacuum Maxwell equations have solutions describing electromagnetic waves. However, gravitational waves can actually form black holes when they collide. This raises the question of the stability of Minkowski spacetime. Must sufficiently small perturbations of the Minkowski metric go away in the form of gravitational radiation, or can tiny wrinkles in the fabric of spacetime somehow amplify themselves and cause trouble&#8212;perhaps even a singularity? In 1993, together with Klainerman, Christodoulou proved that Minkowski spacetime is indeed stable. Their proof fills a 514-page book.</p>
<p>In 2008, Christodoulou completed an <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.3880">even longer rigorous study</a> of the formation of black holes. This can be seen as a vastly more detailed look at questions which Penrose&#8217;s original singularity theorem addressed in a general, preliminary way. Nonetheless, there is <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0505133">much left to be done</a> to understand the behavior of singularities in general relativity.</p>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>In this series of posts, we&#8217;ve seen that in every major theory of physics, challenging mathematical questions arise from the assumption that spacetime is a continuum. The continuum threatens us with infinities! Do these infinities threaten our ability to extract predictions from these theories&#8212;or even our ability to formulate these theories in a precise way?</p>
<p>We can answer these questions, but only with hard work. Is this a sign that we are somehow on the wrong track? Is the continuum as we understand it only an approximation to some deeper model of spacetime? Only time will tell. Nature is providing us with plenty of clues, but it will take patience to read them correctly.</p>

					<p>Combining electromagnetism with relativity and quantum mechanics led to QED. <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2016/09/21/struggles-with-the-continuum-part-6/">Last time</a> we saw the immense struggles with the continuum this caused. But combining gravity with relativity led Einstein to something equally remarkable: <em>general relativity</em>.</p>

<p>In general relativity, infinities coming from the continuum nature of spacetime are deeply connected to its most dramatic successful predictions: black holes and the Big Bang. In this theory, the density of the Universe approaches infinity as we go back in time toward the Big Bang, and the density of a star approaches infinity as it collapses to form a black hole. Thus we might say that instead of struggling against infinities, general relativity <em>accepts</em> them and has learned to live with them.</p>
<p>General relativity does not take quantum mechanics into account, so the story is not yet over. Many physicists hope that quantum gravity will eventually save physics from its struggles with the continuum! Since quantum gravity far from being understood, this remains just a hope. This hope has motivated a profusion of new ideas on spacetime: too many to survey here. Instead, I&#8217;ll focus on the humbler issue of how singularities arise in general relativity&#8212;and why they might not rob this theory of its predictive power.</p>
<p>General relativity says that spacetime is a 4-dimensional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentzian_manifold">Lorentzian manifold</a>. Thus, it can be covered by patches equipped with coordinates, so that in each patch we can describe points by lists of four numbers. Any curve <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma%28s%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;gamma(s)" class="latex" /> going through a point then has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_vector">tangent vector</a> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="v" class="latex" /> whose components are <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v%5E%5Cmu+%3D+d+%5Cgamma%5E%5Cmu%28s%29%2Fds.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="v^&#92;mu = d &#92;gamma^&#92;mu(s)/ds." class="latex" /> Furthermore, given two tangent vectors <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v%2Cw&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="v,w" class="latex" /> at the same point we can take their inner product</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g%28v%2Cw%29+%3D+g_%7B%5Cmu+%5Cnu%7D+v%5E%5Cmu+w%5E%5Cnu+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="g(v,w) = g_{&#92;mu &#92;nu} v^&#92;mu w^&#92;nu " class="latex" /></p>
<p>where as usual we sum over repeated indices, and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g_%7B%5Cmu+%5Cnu%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="g_{&#92;mu &#92;nu}" class="latex" /> is a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=4+%5Ctimes+4&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="4 &#92;times 4" class="latex" /> matrix called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tensor">metric</a>, depending smoothly on the point. We require that at any point we can find some coordinate system where this matrix takes the usual Minkowski form:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B++g+%3D+%5Cleft%28+%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Bcccc%7D+-1+%26+0+%260+%26+0+%5C%5C+0+%26+1+%260+%26+0+%5C%5C+0+%26+0+%261+%26+0+%5C%5C+0+%26+0+%260+%26+1+%5C%5C+%5Cend%7Barray%7D%5Cright%29.+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{  g = &#92;left( &#92;begin{array}{cccc} -1 &amp; 0 &amp;0 &amp; 0 &#92;&#92; 0 &amp; 1 &amp;0 &amp; 0 &#92;&#92; 0 &amp; 0 &amp;1 &amp; 0 &#92;&#92; 0 &amp; 0 &amp;0 &amp; 1 &#92;&#92; &#92;end{array}&#92;right). } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>However, as soon as we move away from our chosen point, the form of the matrix <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="g" class="latex" /> in these particular coordinates may change.</p>
<p>General relativity says how the metric is affected by matter. It does this in a single equation, Einstein&#8217;s equation, which relates the &#8216;curvature&#8217; of the metric at any point to the flow of energy-momentum through that point. To define the curvature, we need some differential geometry. Indeed, Einstein had to learn this subject from his mathematician friend Marcel Grossman in order to write down his equation. Here I will take some shortcuts and try to explain Einstein&#8217;s equation with a bare minimum of differential geometry. For how this approach connects to the full story, and a list of resources for further study of general relativity, see:</p>
<p>• John Baez and Emory Bunn, <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/einstein/">The meaning of Einstein&#8217;s equation</a>.</p>
<p>Consider a small round ball of test particles that are initially all at rest relative to each other. This requires a bit of explanation. First, because spacetime is curved, it only looks like Minkowski spacetime&#8212;the world of special relativity&#8212;in the limit of very small regions. The usual concepts of &#8217;round&#8217; and &#8216;at rest relative to each other&#8217; only make sense in this limit. Thus, all our forthcoming statements are precise only in this limit, which of course relies on the fact that spacetime is a continuum.</p>
<p>Second, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_particle">test particle</a> is a classical point particle with so little mass that while it is affected by gravity, its effects on the geometry of spacetime are negligible. We assume our test particles are affected only by gravity, no other forces. In general relativity this means that they move along timelike geodesics. Roughly speaking, these are paths that go slower than light and bend as little as possible. We can make this precise without much work.</p>
<p>For a path in <em>space</em> to be a geodesic means that if we slightly vary any small portion of it, it can only become longer. However, a path <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma%28s%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;gamma(s)" class="latex" /> in <em>spacetime</em> traced out by particle moving slower than light must be &#8216;timelike&#8217;, meaning that its tangent vector <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v+%3D+%5Cgamma%27%28s%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="v = &#92;gamma&#039;(s)" class="latex" /> satisfies <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g%28v%2Cv%29+%3C+0.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="g(v,v) &lt; 0." class="latex" /> We define the proper time along such a path from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s+%3D+s_0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="s = s_0" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s+%3D+s_1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="s = s_1" class="latex" /> to be</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B++%5Cint_%7Bs_0%7D%5E%7Bs_1%7D+%5Csqrt%7B-g%28%5Cgamma%27%28s%29%2C%5Cgamma%27%28s%29%29%7D+%5C%2C+ds+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{  &#92;int_{s_0}^{s_1} &#92;sqrt{-g(&#92;gamma&#039;(s),&#92;gamma&#039;(s))} &#92;, ds } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>This is the time ticked out by a clock moving along that path. A timelike path is a geodesic if the proper time can only <em>decrease</em> when we slightly vary any small portion of it. Particle physicists prefer the opposite sign convention for the metric, and then we do not need the minus sign under the square root. But the fact remains the same: timelike geodesics locally maximize the proper time.</p>
<p>Actual particles are not test particles! First, the concept of test particle does not take quantum theory into account. Second, all known particles are affected by forces other than gravity. Third, any actual particle affects the geometry of the spacetime it inhabits. Test particles are just a mathematical trick for studying the geometry of spacetime. Still, a sufficiently light particle that is affected very little by forces other than gravity can be approximated by a test particle. For example, an artificial satellite moving through the Solar System behaves like a test particle if we ignore the solar wind, the radiation pressure of the Sun, and so on.</p>
<p>If we start with a small round ball consisting of many test particles that are initially all at rest relative to each other, to first order in time it will not change shape or size. However, to second order in time it can expand or shrink, due to the curvature of spacetime. It may also be stretched or squashed, becoming an ellipsoid. This should not be too surprising, because any linear transformation applied to a ball gives an ellipsoid.</p>
<p>Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V%28t%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="V(t)" class="latex" /> be the volume of the ball after a time <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="t" class="latex" /> has elapsed, where time is measured by a clock attached to the particle at the center of the ball. Then in units where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+%3D+8+%5Cpi+G+%3D+1%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c = 8 &#92;pi G = 1," class="latex" /> Einstein&#8217;s equation says:</p>

<p>These flows here are measured at the center of the ball at time zero, and the coordinates used here take advantage of the fact that to first order, at any one point, spacetime looks like Minkowski spacetime.</p>

This is just the energy density, usually denoted <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;rho." class="latex" /> The flow of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" />-momentum in the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" />-direction is the pressure in the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> direction, denoted <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_x%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="P_x," class="latex" /> and similarly for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="z." class="latex" /> You may be more familiar with direction-independent pressures, but it is easy to manufacture a situation where the pressure depends on the direction: just squeeze a book between your hands!</p>
<p>Thus, Einstein&#8217;s equation says</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%7B%5Cddot+V%5Cover+V%7D+%5CBigr%7C_%7Bt+%3D+0%7D+%3D+-%7B1%5Cover+2%7D+%28%5Crho+%2B+P_x+%2B+P_y+%2B+P_z%29+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ {&#92;ddot V&#92;over V} &#92;Bigr|_{t = 0} = -{1&#92;over 2} (&#92;rho + P_x + P_y + P_z) } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>It follows that positive energy density and positive pressure both curve spacetime in a way that makes a freely falling ball of point particles tend to shrink. Since <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E+%3D+mc%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="E = mc^2" class="latex" /> and we are working in units where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+%3D+1%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c = 1," class="latex" /> ordinary mass density counts as a form of energy density. Thus a massive object will make a swarm of freely falling particles at rest around it start to shrink. In short, <em>gravity attracts</em>.</p>
<p>Already from this, gravity seems dangerously inclined to create singularities. Suppose that instead of test particles we start with a stationary cloud of &#8216;dust&#8217;: a fluid of particles having nonzero energy density but no pressure, moving under the influence of gravity alone. The dust particles will still follow geodesics, but they will affect the geometry of spacetime. Their energy density will make the ball start to shrink. As it does, the energy density <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;rho" class="latex" /> will increase, so the ball will tend to shrink ever faster, approaching infinite density in a finite amount of time. This in turn makes the curvature of spacetime become infinite in a finite amount of time. The result is a &#8216;singularity&#8217;.</p>
<p>In reality, matter is affected by forces other than gravity. Repulsive forces may prevent gravitational collapse. However, this repulsion creates pressure, and Einstein&#8217;s equation says that pressure also creates gravitational attraction! In some circumstances this can overwhelm whatever repulsive forces are present. Then the matter collapses, leading to a singularity&#8212;at least according to general relativity.</p>
<p>When a star more than 8 times the mass of our Sun runs out of fuel, its core suddenly collapses. The surface is thrown off explosively in an event called a supernova. Most of the energy&#8212;the equivalent of thousands of Earth masses&#8212;is released in a ten-second burst of neutrinos, formed as a byproduct when protons and electrons combine to form neutrons. If the star&#8217;s mass is below 20 times that of our the Sun, its core crushes down to a large ball of neutrons with a crust of iron and other elements: a neutron star.</p>
<p>However, this ball is unstable if its mass exceeds the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolman%E2%80%93Oppenheimer%E2%80%93Volkoff_limit">Tolman&#8211;Oppenheimer&#8211;Volkoff limit</a>, somewhere between 1.5 and 3 times that of our Sun. Above this limit, gravity overwhelms the repulsive forces that hold up the neutron star. And indeed, no neutron stars heavier than 3 solar masses have been observed. Thus, for very heavy stars, the endpoint of collapse is not a neutron star, but something else: a <em>black hole</em>, an object that bends spacetime so much even light cannot escape.</p>
<p>If general relativity is correct, a black hole contains a singularity. Many physicists expect that general relativity breaks down inside a black hole, perhaps because of quantum effects that become important at strong gravitational fields. The singularity is considered a strong hint that this breakdown occurs. If so, the singularity may be a purely theoretical entity, not a real-world phenomenon. Nonetheless, everything we have observed about black holes matches what general relativity predicts. Thus, unlike all the other theories we have discussed, general relativity predicts infinities that are connected to striking phenomena that are <em>actually observed</em>.</p>
<p>The Tolman&#8211;Oppenheimer&#8211;Volkoff limit is not precisely known, because it depends on properties of nuclear matter that are not well understood. However, there are theorems that say singularities <em>must</em> occur in general relativity under certain conditions.</p>
<p>One of the first was proved by Raychauduri and Komar in the mid-1950&#8217;s. It applies only to &#8216;dust&#8217;, and indeed it is a precise version of our verbal argument above. It introduced the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raychaudhuri_equation">Raychauduri&#8217;s equation</a>, which is the geometrical way of thinking about spacetime curvature as affecting the motion of a small ball of test particles. It shows that under suitable conditions, the energy density must approach infinity in a finite amount of time along the path traced out out by a dust particle.</p>
<p>The first required condition is that the flow of dust be initally converging, not expanding. The second condition, not mentioned in our verbal argument, is that the dust be &#8216;irrotational&#8217;, not swirling around. The third condition is that the dust particles be affected only by gravity, so that they move along geodesics. Due to the last two conditions, the Raychauduri&#8211;Komar theorem does not apply to collapsing stars.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose%E2%80%93Hawking_singularity_theorems">more modern singularity theorems</a> eliminate these conditions. But they do so at a price: they require a more subtle concept of singularity! There are various possible ways to define this concept. They&#8217;re all a bit tricky, because a singularity is not a point or region in spacetime.</p>
<p>For our present purposes, we can define a singularity to be an &#8216;incomplete timelike or null geodesic&#8217;. As already explained, a timelike geodesic is the kind of path traced out by a test particle moving slower than light. Similarly, a null geodesic is the kind of path traced out by a test particle moving at the speed of light. We say a geodesic is &#8216;incomplete&#8217; if it ceases to be well-defined after a finite amount of time. For example, general relativity says a test particle falling into a black hole follows an incomplete geodesic. In a rough-and-ready way, people say the particle &#8216;hits the singularity&#8217;. But the singularity is not a place in spacetime. What we really mean is that the particle&#8217;s path becomes undefined after a finite amount of time.</p>
<p>We need to be a bit careful about what we mean by &#8216;time&#8217; here. For test particles moving slower than light this is easy, since we can parametrize a timelike geodesic by proper time. However, the tangent vector <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v+%3D+%5Cgamma%27%28s%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="v = &#92;gamma&#039;(s)" class="latex" /> of a null geodesic has <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g%28v%2Cv%29+%3D+0%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="g(v,v) = 0," class="latex" /> so a particle moving along a null geodesic does not experience any passage of proper time. Still, any geodesic, even a null one, has a family of preferred parametrizations. These differ only by changes of variable like this: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s+%5Cmapsto+as+%2B+b.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="s &#92;mapsto as + b." class="latex" /> By &#8216;time&#8217; we really mean the variable <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="s" class="latex" /> in any of these preferred parametrizations. Thus, if our spacetime is some Lorentzian manifold <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="M," class="latex" /> we say a geodesic <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma+%5Ccolon+%5Bs_0%2C+s_1%5D+%5Cto+M&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;gamma &#92;colon [s_0, s_1] &#92;to M" class="latex" /> is incomplete if, parametrized in one of these preferred ways, it cannot be extended to a strictly longer interval.</p>
<p>The first modern singularity theorem was proved by Penrose in 1965. It says that if space is infinite in extent, and light becomes trapped inside some bounded region, and no exotic matter is present to save the day, either a singularity or something even more bizarre must occur. This theorem applies to collapsing stars. When a star of sufficient mass collapses, general relativity says that its gravity becomes so strong that light becomes trapped inside some bounded region. We can then use Penrose&#8217;s theorem to analyze the possibilities.</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter Hawking proved a second singularity theorem, which applies to the Big Bang. It says that if space is finite in extent, and no exotic matter is present, generically either a singularity or something even more bizarre must occur. The singularity here could be either a Big Bang in the past, a Big Crunch in the future, both&#8212;or possibly something else. Hawking also proved a version of his theorem that applies to certain Lorentzian manifolds where space is infinite in extent, as seems to be the case in our Universe. This version requires extra conditions.</p>
<p>There are some undefined phrases in this summary of the Penrose&#8211;Hawking singularity theorems, most notably these:</p>
<p>• &#8216;exotic matter&#8217;</p>
<p>• &#8216;singularity&#8217;</p>
<p>• &#8216;something even more bizarre&#8217;.</p>
<p>So, let me say a bit about each.</p>
<p>These singularity theorems precisely specify what is meant by &#8216;exotic matter&#8217;.  All known forms of matter obey the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0403">&#8216;dominant energy condition&#8217;</a>, which says that</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7CP_x%7C%2C+%5C%2C+%7CP_y%7C%2C+%5C%2C+%7CP_z%7C+%5Cle+%5Crho+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="|P_x|, &#92;, |P_y|, &#92;, |P_z| &#92;le &#92;rho " class="latex" /></p>
<p>at all points and in all locally Minkowskian coordinates.  Exotic matter is anything that violates this condition.</p>
<p>The Penrose&#8211;Hawking singularity theorems also say what counts as &#8216;something even more bizarre&#8217;. An example would be a closed timelike curve. A particle following such a path would move slower than light yet eventually reach the same point where it started&#8212;and not just the same point in space, but the same point in <em>spacetime!</em> If you could do this, perhaps you could wait, see if it would rain tomorrow, and then go back and decide whether to buy an umbrella today. There are certainly solutions of Einstein&#8217;s equation with closed timelike curves. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del_metric">first interesting one</a> was found by Einstein&#8217;s friend Gödel in 1949, as part of an attempt to probe the nature of time. However, closed timelike curves are generally considered less plausible than singularities.</p>
<p>In the Penrose&#8211;Hawking singularity theorems, &#8216;something even more bizarre&#8217; means that spacetime is not &#8216;globally hyperbolic&#8217;. To understand this, we need to think about when we can predict the future or past given initial data. When studying field equations like Maxwell&#8217;s theory of electromagnetism or Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity, physicists like to specify initial data on space at a given moment of time. However, in general relativity there is considerable freedom in how we choose a slice of spacetime and call it &#8216;space&#8217;. What should we require? For starters, we want a 3-dimensional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submanifold">submanifold</a> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S" class="latex" /> of spacetime that is &#8216;spacelike&#8217;: every vector <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="v" class="latex" /> tangent to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S" class="latex" /> should have <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g%28v%2Cv%29+%3E+0.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="g(v,v) &gt; 0." class="latex" /> However, we also want any timelike or null curve to hit <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S" class="latex" /> exactly once. A spacelike surface with this property is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_surface">Cauchy surface</a>, and a Lorentzian manifold containing a Cauchy surface is said to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globally_hyperbolic_manifold">globally hyperbolic</a>. There are many theorems justifying the importance of this concept. Globally hyperbolicity excludes closed timelike curves, but also other bizarre behavior.</p>
<p>By now the original singularity theorems have been greatly generalized and clarified. Hawking and Penrose gave a unified treatment of both theorems in 1970. The 1973 textbook by Hawking and Ellis gives a systematic introduction to this subject. Hawking gave an <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9409195">elegant informal overview</a> of the key ideas in 1994, and a <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.5226">paper by Garfinkle and Senovilla</a> reviews the subject and its history up to 2015.</p>
<p>If we accept that general relativity really predicts the existence of singularities in physically realistic situations, the next step is to ask whether they rob general relativity of its predictive power. I&#8217;ll talk about that <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2016/09/25/struggles-with-the-continuum-part-8/">next time</a>!</p>

			<div class="textwidget"><p>You can <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics">include math in your comments using LaTeX</a>,  but you need to do it this way:</p>
<p>&#036;latex  E = mc^2&#036;</p>
<p>You need the word 'latex' right after the first dollar sign, and it needs a space after it.  Double dollar signs don't work, and other limitations apply, some described <a href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/latex/">here</a>.  You can't preview comments here, but I'm happy to fix errors.</p>
