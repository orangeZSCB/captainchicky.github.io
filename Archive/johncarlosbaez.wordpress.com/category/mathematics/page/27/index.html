					<p>The structure of a diamond crystal is fascinating.  But there&#8217;s an equally fascinating form of carbon, called the <b>triamond</b>, that&#8217;s theoretically possible but never yet seen in nature.  Here it is:</p>

<p>In the triamond, each carbon atom is bonded to three others at 120° angles, with one double bond and two single bonds.  Its bonds lie in a plane, so we get a plane for each atom.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s the tricky part: for any two neighboring atoms, these planes are <i>different.</i>  In fact, if we draw the bond planes for all the atoms in the triamond, they come in four kinds, parallel to the faces of a regular tetrahedron!</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="150" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/400px-tetrahedron.png" />
</div>
<p>If we discount the difference between single and double bonds, the triamond is highly symmetrical.  There&#8217;s a symmetry carrying any atom and any of its bonds to any other atom and any of <i>its</i> bonds.  However, the triamond has an inherent handedness, or chirality.  It comes in two mirror-image forms.</p>
<p>A rather surprising thing about the triamond is that the smallest rings of atoms are 10-sided.  Each atom lies in 15 of these 10-sided rings.</p>
<p>Some chemists have argued that the triamond should be &#8216;metastable&#8217; at room temperature and pressure: that is, it should last for a while but eventually turn to graphite. Diamonds are also considered metastable, though I&#8217;ve never seen anyone pull an old diamond ring from their jewelry cabinet and discover to their shock that it&#8217;s turned to graphite.  The big difference is that diamonds are formed naturally under high pressure—while triamonds, it seems, are not.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the mathematics behind the triamond <i>does</i> find its way into nature.  A while back I told you about a minimal surface called the &#8216;gyroid&#8217;, which is found in many places:</p>
<p>• <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/08/11/the-physics-of-butterfly-wings/">The physics of butterfly wings</a>.</p>
<p>It turns out that the pattern of a gyroid is closely connected to the triamond!  So, if you&#8217;re looking for a triamond-like pattern in nature, certain butterfly wings are your best bet:</p>

<p>Instead of trying to explain it here, I&#8217;ll refer you to the wonderful pictures at Weber&#8217;s blog.</p>
<h3> Building the triamond </h3>
<p>I want to tell you a way to build the triamond.  I saw it here:</p>
<p>• Toshikazu Sunada, <a href="http://www.ams.org/notices/200802/tx080200208p.pdf">Crystals that nature might miss creating</a>, <i>Notices of the American Mathematical Society</i> <b>55</b> (2008), 208–215.</p>
<p>This is the paper that got people excited about the triamond, though it was discovered much earlier by the crystallographer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Laves">Fritz Laves</a> back in 1932, and Coxeter named it the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laves_graph">Laves graph</a>.</p>
<p>To build the triamond, we can start with this graph:</p>

</div>
<p>It&#8217;s called <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BK%7D_4%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{K}_4," class="latex" /> since it&#8217;s the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_graph">complete graph on four vertices</a>, meaning there&#8217;s one edge between each pair of vertices.  The  vertices correspond to four different kinds of atoms in the triamond: let&#8217;s call them red, green, yellow and blue.  The edges of this graph have arrows on them, labelled with certain vectors</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e_1%2C+e_2%2C+e_3%2C+f_1%2C+f_2%2C+f_3+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="e_1, e_2, e_3, f_1, f_2, f_3 &#92;in &#92;mathbb{R}^3" class="latex" /></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s not worry yet about what these vectors are.  What really matters is this: to move from any atom in the triamond to any of its neighbors, you move along the vector labeling the edge between them&#8230; or its negative, if you&#8217;re moving against the arrow.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you&#8217;re at any red atom.  It has 3 nearest neighbors, which are blue, green and yellow.  To move to the blue neighbor you add <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_1" class="latex" /> to your position.  To move to the green one you subtract <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e_2%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="e_2," class="latex" /> since you&#8217;re moving <i>against</i> the arrow on the edge connecting blue and green.   Similarly, to go to the yellow neighbor you subtract the vector <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_3" class="latex" /> from your position.</p>
<p>Thus, any path along the bonds of the triamond determines a path in the graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BK%7D_4.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{K}_4." class="latex" /></p>
<p>Conversely, if you pick an atom of some color in the triamond, any path in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BK%7D_4&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{K}_4" class="latex" /> starting from the vertex of that color determines a path in the triamond!  However, going around a loop in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BK%7D_4&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{K}_4" class="latex" /> may not get you back to the atom you started with in the triamond.</p>
<p>Mathematicians summarize these facts by saying the triamond is a &#8216;covering space&#8217; of the graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BK%7D_4.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{K}_4." class="latex" /></p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s see if you can figure out those vectors.</p>
<p><b>Puzzle 1.</b>  Find vectors <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e_1%2C+e_2%2C+e_3%2C+f_1%2C+f_2%2C+f_3+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="e_1, e_2, e_3, f_1, f_2, f_3 &#92;in &#92;mathbb{R}^3" class="latex" /> such that:</p>
<p>A) All these vectors have the same length.</p>
<p>B) The three vectors coming out of any vertex lie in a plane at 120° angles to each other:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://www.ams.org/notices/200802/tx080200208p.pdf"><br />
<img src="https://johncarlosbaez.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/k4_graph_colored_sunada.jpg?w=180" alt="k4_graph_colored_sunada" width="180" /></a>
</div>
<p>For example, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_1%2C+-e_2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_1, -e_2" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=-f_3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="-f_3" class="latex" /> lie in a plane at 120° angles to each other.  We put in two minus signs because two arrows are pointing into the red vertex.</p>
<p>C) The four planes we get this way, one for each vertex, are parallel to the faces of a regular tetrahedron.</p>
<p>If you want, you can even add another constraint:</p>
<p>D) All the components of the vectors <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e_1%2C+e_2%2C+e_3%2C+f_1%2C+f_2%2C+f_3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="e_1, e_2, e_3, f_1, f_2, f_3" class="latex" /> are integers.</p>
<h3> Diamonds and hyperdiamonds </h3>
<p>That&#8217;s the triamond.  Compare the diamond:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Diamond_Cubic-F_lattice_animation.gif"><br />
<img src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/diamond.gif" /></a>
</div>
<p>Here each atom of carbon is connected to four others.  This pattern is found not just in carbon but also other elements in the same column of the periodic table: silicon, germanium, and tin.  They all like to hook up with four neighbors.</p>
<p>The pattern of atoms in a diamond is called the <b>diamond cubic</b>.  It&#8217;s elegant but a bit tricky.   Look at it carefully!</p>
<p>To build it, we start by putting an atom at each <i>corner</i> of a cube.  Then we put an atom in the middle of each <i>face</i> of the cube.  If we stopped there, we would have a <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close-packing_of_equal_spheres#fcc_and_hcp_lattices">face-centered cubic</a></b>.   But there are also four more carbons inside the cube&#8212;one at the center of each tetrahedron we&#8217;ve created.</p>
<p>If you look really carefully, you can see that the full pattern consists of two interpenetrating face-centered cubic lattices, one offset relative to the other along the cube&#8217;s main diagonal.</p>
<p>The face-centered cubic is the 3-dimensional version of a pattern that exists in any dimension: the <b>D<sub>n</sub> lattice</b>.   To build this, take an n-dimensional checkerboard and alternately color the hypercubes red and black.  Then, put a point in the center of each black hypercube!</p>
<p>You can also get the D<sub>n</sub> lattice by taking all n-tuples of integers that sum to an even integer.  Requiring that they sum to something <i>even</i> is a way to pick out the black hypercubes.</p>
<p>The diamond is also an example of a pattern that exists in any dimension!  I&#8217;ll call this the <b>hyperdiamond</b>, but mathematicians call it <b>D<sub>n</sub><sup>+</sup></b>, because it&#8217;s the union of two copies of the D<sub>n</sub> lattice.   To build it, first take all n-tuples of integers that sum to an even integer.  Then take all those points shifted by the vector (1/2, &#8230;, 1/2).</p>
<p>In any dimension, the volume of the unit cell of the hyperdiamond is 1, so mathematicians say it&#8217;s <b>unimodular</b>.  But only in even dimensions is the sum or difference of any two points in the hyperdiamond again a point in the hyperdiamond.  Mathematicians call a discrete set of points with this property a <b>lattice</b>.</p>
<p>If even dimensions are better than odd ones, how about dimensions that are multiples of 4?   Then the hyperdiamond is better still: it&#8217;s an <b>integral</b> lattice, meaning that the dot product of any two vectors in the lattice is again an integer.</p>
<p>And in dimensions that are multiples of 8, the hyperdiamond is even better.  It&#8217;s <b>even</b>, meaning that the dot product of any vector with itself is even.</p>
<p>In fact, even unimodular lattices are only possible in Euclidean space when the dimension is a multiple of 8.  In 8 dimensions, the only even unimodular lattice is the 8-dimensional hyperdiamond, which is usually called the <b>E<sub>8</sub> lattice</b>.  The E<sub>8</sub> lattice is one of my favorite entities, and I&#8217;ve written a lot about it in this series:</p>
<p>• <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/octonions/integers/">Integral octonions</a>.</p>
<p>To me, the glittering beauty of diamonds is just a tiny hint of the overwhelming beauty of E<sub>8</sub>.</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s go back down to 3 dimensions.  I&#8217;d like to describe the diamond rather explicitly, so we can see how a slight change produces the triamond.</p>
<p>It will be less stressful if we double the size of our diamond.  So, let&#8217;s start with a face-centered cubic consisting of points whose coordinates are even integers summing to a multiple of 4.  That consists of these points:</p>
<p>(0,0,0)   (2,2,0)   (2,0,2)   (0,2,2)</p>
<p>and all points obtained from these by adding multiples of 4 to any of the coordinates.  To get the diamond, we take all these together with another face-centered cubic that&#8217;s been shifted by (1,1,1).  That consists of these points:</p>
<p>(1,1,1)   (3,3,1)   (3,1,3)   (1,3,3)</p>
<p>and all points obtained by adding multiples of 4 to any of the coordinates.</p>
<p>The triamond is similar!  Now we start with these points</p>
<p>(0,0,0)   (1,2,3)   (2,3,1)   (3,1,2)</p>
<p>and all the points obtain from these by adding multiples of 4 to any of the coordinates.  To get the triamond, we take all these together with another copy of these points that&#8217;s been shifted by (2,2,2).  That other copy consists of these points:</p>
<p>(2,2,2)   (3,0,1)   (0,1,3)   (1,3,0)</p>
<p>and all points obtained by adding multiples of 4 to any of the coordinates.</p>
<p>Unlike the diamond, the triamond has an inherent handedness, or chirality.  You&#8217;ll note how we used the point (1,2,3) and took cyclic permutations of its coordinates to get more points.  If we&#8217;d started with (3,2,1) we would have gotten the other, mirror-image version of the triamond.</p>
<h3> Covering spaces </h3>
<p>I mentioned that the triamond is a &#8216;covering space&#8217; of the graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BK%7D_4.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{K}_4." class="latex" />   More precisely, there&#8217;s a graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T" class="latex" /> whose vertices are the atoms of the triamond, and whose edges are the bonds of the triamond.  There&#8217;s a map of graphs</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%3A+T+%5Cto+%5Cmathrm%7BK%7D_4+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p: T &#92;to &#92;mathrm{K}_4 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>This automatically means that every path in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T" class="latex" /> is mapped to a path in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BK%7D_4.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{K}_4." class="latex" />  But what makes <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T" class="latex" /> a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covering_space"><b>covering space</b></a> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BK%7D_4&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{K}_4" class="latex" /> is that any path in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T" class="latex" /> comes from a path in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BK%7D_4%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{K}_4," class="latex" /> which is <i>unique</i> after we choose its starting point.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a high-powered mathematician you might wonder if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T" class="latex" /> is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covering_space#Universal_covers">universal covering space</a> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BK%7D_4.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{K}_4." class="latex" />  It&#8217;s not, but it&#8217;s the universal <i>abelian</i> covering space.</p>
<p>What does this mean?   Any path in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BK%7D_4&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{K}_4" class="latex" /> gives a sequence of vectors <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e_1%2C+e_2%2C+e_3%2C+f_1%2C+f_2%2C+f_3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="e_1, e_2, e_3, f_1, f_2, f_3" class="latex" /> and their negatives.  If we pick a starting point in the triamond, this sequence describes a unique path in the triamond.  <i>When does this path get you back where you started?</i>  The answer, I believe, is this: if and only if you can take your sequence, rewrite it using the commutative law, and cancel like terms to get zero.  This is related to how adding vectors in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}^3" class="latex" /> is a commutative operation.</p>

</div>
<p>For example, there&#8217;s a loop in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BK%7D_4&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{K}_4" class="latex" /> that goes &#8220;red, blue, green, red&#8221;.  This gives the sequence of vectors</p>

<p>We can turn this into an expression</p>

<p>However, we can&#8217;t simplify this to zero using just the commutative law and cancelling like terms.  So, if we start at some red atom in the triamond and take the unique path that goes &#8220;red, blue, green, red&#8221;, we do not get back where we started!</p>
<p>Note that in this simplification process, we&#8217;re not allowed to use what the vectors &#8220;really are&#8221;.  It&#8217;s a purely formal manipulation.</p>
<p><b>Puzzle 2.</b>  Describe a loop of length 10 in the triamond using this method.   Check that you can simplify the corresponding expression to zero using the rules I described.</p>
<p>A similar story works for the diamond, but starting with a different graph:</p>

<p>The graph formed by a diamond&#8217;s atoms and the edges between them is the universal abelian cover of this little graph!  This graph has 2 vertices because there are 2 kinds of atom in the diamond.  It has 4 edges because each atom has 4 nearest neighbors.</p>
<p><b>Puzzle 3.</b>  What vectors should we use to label the edges of this graph, so that the vectors coming out of any vertex describe how to move from that kind of atom in the diamond to its 4 nearest neighbors?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a similar story for graphene, which is hexagonal array of carbon atoms in a plane:</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know much about how this universal abelian cover trick generalizes to higher dimensions, though it&#8217;s easy to handle the case of a cubical lattice in any dimension.</p>
<p><b>Puzzle 5.</b> I described higher-dimensional analogues of diamonds: are there higher-dimensional triamonds?</p>

<p>The Wikipedia article is good:</p>
<p>• Wikipedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laves_graph">Laves graph</a>.</p>
<p>They say this graph has many names: the <b>K<sub>4</sub> crystal</b>, the <b>(10,3)-a network</b><b>, the </b><b>srs net</b>, the <b>diamond twin</b>, and of course the <b>triamond</b>.  The name triamond is not very logical: while each carbon has 3 neighbors in the triamond, each carbon has not 2 but 4 neighbors in the diamond.  So, perhaps the diamond should be called the &#8216;quadriamond&#8217;.  In fact, the word &#8216;diamond&#8217; has nothing to do with the prefix &#8216;di-&#8216; meaning &#8216;two&#8217;.  It&#8217;s more closely related to the word &#8216;adamant&#8217;.  Still, I like the word &#8216;triamond&#8217;.</p>

<b>Abstract.</b> Recently, mathematical analysis clarified that sp<sup>2</sup> hybridized carbon should have a three-dimensional crystal structure (<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BK%7D_4&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{K}_4" class="latex" />) which can be regarded as a twin of the sp<sup>3</sup> diamond crystal. In this study, various physical properties of the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BK%7D_4&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{K}_4" class="latex" /> carbon crystal, especially for the electronic properties, were evaluated by first principles calculations.

Twisted π states across the Fermi level result in metallic properties in a new carbon crystal.

					<p>I love the more mind-blowing results of mathematical logic:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/surprises.html">Surprises in logic</a>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a new one:</p>
<p>&bull; Joel David Hamkins, <a href="http://jdh.hamkins.org/every-function-can-be-computable/">Any function can be computable</a>.</p>
<p>Let me try to explain it without assuming you&#8217;re an expert on mathematical logic.  That may be hard, but I&#8217;ll give it a try.  We need to start with some background.</p>
<p>First, you need to know that there are many different &#8216;models&#8217; of arithmetic.  If you write down the usual axioms for the natural numbers, the <a href="http://www.xamuel.com/the-axioms-of-peano-arithmetic-modern-version/">Peano axioms</a> (or &#8216;PA&#8217; for short), you can then look around for different structures that obey these axioms.  These are called &#8216;models&#8217; of PA.</p>
<p>One of them is what <i>you</i> think the natural numbers are.  For you, the natural numbers are just 0, 1, 2, 3, &#8230;, with the usual way of adding and multiplying them.  This is usually called the &#8216;standard model&#8217; of PA.  The numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, &#8230; are called the &#8216;standard&#8217; natural numbers.</p>
<p>But there are also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-standard_model_of_arithmetic">nonstandard models of arithmetic</a>.   These models contain extra numbers beside the standard ones!  These are called &#8216;nonstandard&#8217; natural numbers.</p>
<p>This takes a while to get used to.  There are several layers of understanding to pass through.</p>
<p>For starters, you should think of these extra &#8216;nonstandard&#8217; natural numbers as bigger than all the standard ones.  So, imagine a whole bunch of extra numbers tacked on after the standard natural numbers, with the operations of addition and multiplication cleverly defined in such a way that all the usual axioms still hold.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t just tack on finitely many extra numbers and get this to work.  But there can be countably many, or uncountably many.  There are infinitely many different ways to do this.  They are all rather hard to describe.</p>
<p>To get a handle on them, it helps to realize this.   Suppose you have a statement S in arithmetic that is neither provable nor disprovable from PA. Then S will hold in some models of arithmetic, while its negation not(S) will hold in some other models.</p>
<p>For example, the G&ouml;del sentence G says &#8220;this sentence is not provable in PA&#8221;.  If Peano arithmetic is consistent, neither G nor not(G) is provable in PA.  So G holds in some models, while not(G) holds in others.</p>
<p>Thus, you can intuitively think of different models as &#8220;possible worlds&#8221;.   If you have an undecidable statement, meaning one that you can&#8217;t prove or disprove in PA, then it holds in some worlds, while its negation holds in other worlds.</p>
<p>In the case of the G&ouml;del sentence G, most mathematicians think G is &#8220;true&#8221;.  Why the quotes?  Truth is a slippery concept in logic&#8212;there&#8217;s no precise definition of what it means for a sentence in arithmetic to be &#8220;true&#8221;.  All we can precisely define is:</p>
<p>1) whether or not a sentence is provable from some axioms</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>2) whether or not a sentence holds in some model.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, mathematicians are human, so they have beliefs about what&#8217;s true.  Many mathematicians believe that G is true: indeed, in popular accounts one often hears that G is &#8220;true but unprovable in Peano arithmetic&#8221;.   So, these mathematicians are inclined to say that any model where G doesn&#8217;t hold is nonstandard.</p>
<h3> The result </h3>
<p>Anyway, what is Joel David Hamkins&#8217; result?  It&#8217;s this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  There is a Turing machine T with the following property.  For any function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" /> from the natural numbers to the natural numbers, there is a model of PA such that <em>in this model</em>, if we give T any standard natural <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" /> as input, it halts and outputs <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28n%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f(n)." class="latex" />
</p></blockquote>
<p>So, take <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" /> to be your favorite uncomputable function.  Then there&#8217;s a model of arithmetic such that <em>in this model</em>, the Turing machine computes <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f," class="latex" /> at least when you feed the machine standard numbers as inputs.</p>
<p>So, <em>very very</em> roughly, there&#8217;s a possible world in which your uncomputable function becomes computable!</p>
<p>But you have to be very careful about how you interpret this result.</p>
<h3> The trick </h3>
<p>What&#8217;s the trick?  The proof is beautiful, but it would take real work to improve on <a href="http://jdh.hamkins.org/every-function-can-be-computable/">Hamkins&#8217; blog article</a>, so please read that.  I&#8217;ll just say that he makes extensive use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosser's_trick">Rosser sentences</a>, which say:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;For any proof of this sentence in theory T, there is a smaller proof of the negation of this sentence.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Rosser sentences are already mind-blowing, but Hamkins uses an <i>infinite sequence</i> of such sentences and their negations, chosen in a way that depends on the function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f," class="latex" /> to cleverly craft a model of arithmetic in which the Turing machine T computes this function on standard inputs.</p>
<p>But what&#8217;s really going on?  How can using a nonstandard model make an uncomputable function become computable for standard natural numbers?  Shouldn&#8217;t nonstandard models agree with the standard one on this issue?  After all, the only difference is that they have extra nonstandard numbers tacked on after all the standard ones!   How can that make a Turing machine succeed in computing <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" /> on <em>standard</em> natural numbers?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not 100% sure, but I think I know the answer.  I hope some logicians will correct me if I&#8217;m wrong.</p>
<p>You have to read the result rather carefully:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  There is a Turing machine T with the following property.  For any function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" /> from the natural numbers to the natural numbers, there is a model of PA such that <em>in this model</em>, if we give T any standard natural <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" /> as input, it halts and computes <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28n%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f(n)." class="latex" />
</p></blockquote>
<p>When we say the Turing machine halts, we mean it halts after <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="N" class="latex" /> steps for some natural number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="N." class="latex" />  But this may not be a standard natural number!  It&#8217;s a natural number in the model we&#8217;re talking about.</p>
<p>So, the Turing machine halts&#8230; but perhaps only after a nonstandard number of steps.</p>
<p>In short: you can compute the uncomputable, but only if you&#8217;re willing to wait long enough.  <i>You may need to wait a nonstandard amount of time</i>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like that old Navy saying:</p>

<p>But the trick becomes more evident if you notice that <em>one single</em> Turing machine T computes <em>different functions</em> from the natural numbers to the natural numbers&#8230; in different models.  That&#8217;s even weirder than computing an uncomputable function.</p>
<p>The only way to build a machine that computes <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%2B1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n+1" class="latex" /> in one model and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%2B2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n+2" class="latex" /> in another to build a machine that doesn&#8217;t halt in a standard amount of time in either model.  It only halts after a <em>nonstandard</em> amount of time.  In one model, it halts and outputs <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%2B1.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n+1." class="latex" />  In another, it halts and outputs <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%2B2.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n+2." class="latex" /></p>
<h3> A scary possibility </h3>
<p>To dig a bit deeper&#8212;and this is where it gets a bit scary&#8212;we have to admit that the standard model is a somewhat elusive thing.  I certainly didn&#8217;t define it when I said this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  For you, the natural numbers are just 0, 1, 2, 3, &#8230;, with the usual way of adding and multiplying them.  This is usually called the <b>standard model</b> of PA.  The numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, &#8230; are called the &#8216;standard&#8217; natural numbers.

<p>The point is that &#8220;0, 1, 2, 3, &#8230;&#8221; here is vague.  It makes sense if you already know what the standard natural numbers are.  But if you don&#8217;t already know, those three dots aren&#8217;t going to tell you!</p>
<p>You might say the standard natural numbers are those of the form 1 + &middot;&middot;&middot; + 1, where we add 1 to itself some finite number of times.  But what does &#8216;finite number&#8217; mean here?  It means a standard natural number!  So this is circular.</p>
<p>So, conceivably, the concept of &#8216;standard&#8217; natural number, and the concept of &#8216;standard&#8217; model of PA, are more subjective than most mathematicians think.  Perhaps some of my &#8216;standard&#8217; natural numbers are nonstandard for you!</p>
<p>I think most mathematicians would reject this possibility&#8230; but not all.  Edward Nelson tackled it head-on in his marvelous book <i><a href="https://web.math.princeton.edu/~nelson/books/1.pdf">Internal Set Theory</a></i>.  He writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Perhaps it is fair to say that “finite” does not mean what we have always thought it to mean. What have we always thought it to mean? I used to think  that I knew what I had always thought it to mean, but I no longer think so.
</p></blockquote>
<p>If we go down this road, Hamkins&#8217; result takes on a different significance.  It says that any subjectivity in the notion of &#8216;natural number&#8217; may also infect what it means for a Turing machine to halt, and what function a Turing machine computes when it does halt.</p>

					<p>Anyone who was interested in the Workshop on Mathematical Trends in Reaction Network Theory last summer in Copenhagen might be interested in this:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://mackie2017.akcongress.com/">Mathematics in (bio)Chemical Kinetics and Engineering (MaCKiE 2017)</a>, Budapest, 25&#8211;27 May, 2017.</p>
<p>This conference is planned so that it starts right after another one: the <a href="http://jetc2017.hu/wordpress/">14th Joint European Thermodynamics Conference</a> will be in Budapest from the 21st to the 25th.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Since its first event in 2002, the MaCKiE workshop is organized in every second year. The previous meetings were held in Ghent (Belgium), Chennai (India), Heidelberg (Germany), and Houston (USA). The meeting aims to bring together scientists interested in the application of advanced mathematical methods to describe kinetic phenomena, especially chemists, mathematicians, physicist, biologists, and engineers. The acronym MaCKiE naturally comes from the title of the conference, but is also part of the German name of Mack the Knife in Brecht and Weill&#8217;s Threepenny Opera, Mackie Messer, and is phonetically indistinguishable from “makkie” in Dutch, optimistically meaning “a cinch”.</p>
<p>  Conference papers will be published in <em>Reaction Kinetics, Mechanisms and Catalysis</em> in early 2018.

				<small>22 March, 2016</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>In his remarkable book <i>The Theory of Singularities and its Applications</i>, Vladimir Arnol&#8217;d claims that the symmetry group of the icosahedron is secretly lurking in the problem of finding the shortest path from one point in the plane to another while avoiding some obstacles that have smooth boundaries.</p>
<p>Arnol&#8217;d nicely expresses the awe mathematicians feel when they discover a phenomenon like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Thus the propagation of waves, on a 2-manifold with boundary, is controlled by an icosahedron hidden at an inflection point at the boundary.  This icosahedron is hidden, and it is difficult to find it even if its existence is known.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I would like to understand this!</p>
<p>I think the easiest way for me to make progress is to solve this problem posed by Arnol&#8217;d:</p>
<p><b>Puzzle.</b> Prove that the generic involute of a cubical parabola has a cusp of order 5/2 on the straight line tangent to the parabola at the inflection point.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of jargon here!  Let me try to demystify it.  (I don&#8217;t have the energy now to say how the symmetry group of the icosahedron gets into the picture, but it&#8217;s connected to the &#8216;5&#8217; in the cusp of order 5/2.)</p>
<p>A <strong><a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CubicalParabola.html">cubical parabola</a></strong> is just a curve like <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y+%3D+x%5E3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y = x^3" class="latex" />:</p>

</div>
<p>It&#8217;s a silly name.  I guess <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y+%3D+x%5E3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y = x^3" class="latex" /> looked at <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y+%3D+x%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y = x^2" class="latex" /> and said &#8220;I want to be a parabola too!&#8221;</p>
<p>The <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involute">involute</a></strong> of a curve is what you get by attaching one end of a taut string to that curve and tracing the path of the string&#8217;s free end as you wind the string onto that curve.  For example:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involute#/media/File:Involute.gif"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/tractrix_as_involute_of_catenary.gif" /></a>
</div>
<p>Here our original curve, in blue, is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catenary"><strong>catenary</strong></a>: the curve formed by a hanging chain.   Its involute is shown in red.</p>
<p>There are a couple of confusing things about this picture if you&#8217;re just starting to learn about involutes.  First, Sam Derbyshire, who made this picture, cleverly moved the end of the string attached to the catenary at the instant the other end hit the catenary!  That allowed him to continue the involute past the moment it hits the catenary.  The result is a famous curve called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tractrix"><strong>tractrix</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Second, it seems that the end of the string attached to the catenary is &#8216;at infinity&#8217;, very far up.</p>
<p>But you don&#8217;t need to play either of these tricks if you&#8217;re trying to draw an involute.  Take a point <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p" class="latex" /> on a curve <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C." class="latex" />  Take a string of length <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cell%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;ell," class="latex" /> nail down one end at <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p," class="latex" /> and wind the string along <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C." class="latex" />  Then the free end of your string traces out a curve <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="D." class="latex" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="D" class="latex" /> is called an <b>involute</b> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C." class="latex" />   It consists of all the points you can get to from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p" class="latex" /> by a path of length <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cell&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;ell" class="latex" /> that doesn&#8217;t cross <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C." class="latex" /></p>
<p>So, Arnol&#8217;d&#8217;s puzzle concerns the involute of the curve <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y+%3D+x%5E3.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y = x^3." class="latex" /></p>
<p>He wants you to nail down one end of the string at any &#8216;generic&#8217; location.  So, don&#8217;t nail it down at <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%3D+0%2C+y+%3D+0%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x = 0, y = 0," class="latex" /> since that point is different from all the rest.  That point is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflection_point">inflection point</a>, where the curve <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y+%3D+x%5E3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y = x^3" class="latex" /> switches from curving down to curving up!</p>
<p>He wants you to wind the string along the curve <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y+%3D+x%5E3%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y = x^3," class="latex" /> forming an involute.  And he wants you to see what the involute does when it crosses the line <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y+%3D+0.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y = 0." class="latex" /></p>
<p>This is a bit tricky, since the region <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y+%5Cle+x%5E3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y &#92;le x^3" class="latex" /> is not convex.  If you nail your string down at <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%3D+-1%2C+y+%3D+-1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x = -1, y = -1" class="latex" />, your string will have to start out <em>above</em> the curve <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y+%3D+x%5E3.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y = x^3." class="latex" />  But when the free end of your string crosses the line <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y+%3D+0%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y = 0," class="latex" /> the story changes.  Now your string will need to go <em>below</em> the curve <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y+%3D+x%5E3.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y = x^3." class="latex" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a bit hard to explain this both simply and accurately, but if you imagine drawing the involute with a piece of string, I think you&#8217;ll encounter the issue I&#8217;m talking about.  I hope I understand it correctly!</p>
<p>Anyway, suppose you succeed in drawing the involute.  What should you see?</p>
<p>Arnol&#8217;d says the involute should have a &#8216;cusp of order 5/2&#8217; somewhere on the line <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y+%3D+0.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y = 0." class="latex" /></p>
<p>A <strong>cusp of order 5/2</strong> is a singularity in an otherwise smooth curve that looks like <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%5E2+%3D+x%5E5&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y^2 = x^5" class="latex" /> in some coordinates.  In <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2016/03/06/the-capricornoid/">a recent post</a> I described various kinds of cusps, and in a comment I mentioned that the cusp of order 5/2 was called a <strong>rhamphoid cusp</strong>.  Strangely, I wrote all that <em>before</em> knowing that Arnol&#8217;d places great significance on the cusp of order 5/2 in the involute of a cubical parabola!</p>
<p>Simon Burton drew some nice cusps of order 5/2.  The curve <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%5E2+%3D+x%5E5&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y^2 = x^5" class="latex" /> looks like this:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/rhamphoid_cusp_1.png"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/rhamphoid_cusp_1.png" alt="Rhamphoid Cusp" width="298" /></a>
</div>
<p>This is a more typical curve with a cusp of order 5/2:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x-4y%5E2%29%5E2+-+%28y%2B+2x%29%5E5+%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(x-4y^2)^2 - (y+ 2x)^5 = 0" class="latex" /></p>
<p>It looks like this:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/rhamphoid_cusp_2.png"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/rhamphoid_cusp_2.png" alt="Rhamphoid Cusp" width="298" /></a>
</div>
<p>It&#8217;s less symmetrical than the curve <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%5E2+%3D+x%5E5.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y^2 = x^5." class="latex" />  Indeed, it looks like a bird&#8217;s beak: the word &#8216;rhamphoid&#8217; means &#8216;beak-like&#8217;.<br />
Arnol&#8217;d emphasizes that you should usually expect this sort of shape for a cusp of order 5/2:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  It is easy to recognize this curve in experimental data, since after a generic diffeomorphism the curve consists of two branches that have equal curvatures at the common point, and hence are convex from the same side [&#8230;.]
</p></blockquote>
<p>So, if we draw the involutes of a cubical parabola we should see something like this!  And indeed, Marshall Hampton has made a <a href="http://sagecell.sagemath.org/?q=hwedlo">great online program</a> that draws these involutes.  Here&#8217;s one:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/involute_of_cubical_parabola.png"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/involute_of_cubical_parabola.png" alt="Involute of cubical parabola - Marshall Hampton" width="298" /></a>
</div>
<p>The blue curve is the involute.  It looks like it has a cusp of order 5/2 where it hits the line <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y+%3D+0.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y = 0." class="latex" />  It also has a less pointy cusp where it hits the red curve <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y+%3D+x%5E3.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y = x^3." class="latex" />   Like the cusp in the tractrix, this should be a cusp of order 3/2, also known as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cusp_%28singularity%29"><b>ordinary cusp</b></a>.</p>
<h3> Hints </h3>
<p>Regarding the easier puzzle I posed above, Arnol&#8217;d gives this hint:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <strong>HINT.</strong> The curvature centers of both branches of the involute, which meet at the point of the inflectional tangent, lie at the inflection point, hence both branches have the same convexity (they are both concave from the side of the inflection point of the boundary).
</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s not what I&#8217;d call crystal clear!  However, I now understand what he means by the two &#8216;branches&#8217; of the involute.  They come from how you need to change the rules of the game as the free end of your string crosses the line <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y+%3D+0.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y = 0." class="latex" />  Remember, I wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  If you nail your string down at <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%3D+-1%2C+y+%3D+-1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x = -1, y = -1" class="latex" />, your string will have to start out <em>above</em> the curve <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y+%3D+x%5E3.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y = x^3." class="latex" />  But when the free end of your string crosses the line <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y+%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y = 0" class="latex" />, the story changes.  Now your string will need to go <em>below</em> the curve <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y+%3D+x%5E3.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y = x^3." class="latex" />
</p></blockquote>
<p>When the rules of the game change, he claims there&#8217;s a cusp of order 5/2 in the involute.</p>
<p>I also think I finally understand the picture that Arnol&#8217;d uses to explain what&#8217;s going on:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/involutes_of_cubical_parabola_arnol'd.png"><img width="400" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/involutes_of_cubical_parabola_arnol'd.png" /></a>
</div>
<p>It shows the curve <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y+%3D+x%5E3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y = x^3" class="latex" /> in bold, and three involutes of this curve.  One involute is not generic: it goes through the special point <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%3D+0%2C+y+%3D+0.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x = 0, y = 0." class="latex" />  The other two are.  They each have a cusp of order 5/2 where they hit the line <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y+%3D+0%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y = 0," class="latex" /> but also a cusp of order 3/2 where they hit the curve <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y+%3D+x%5E3.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y = x^3." class="latex" />   We can recognize the cusps of order 5/2, if we look carefully, by the fact that both branches are convex on the same side.</p>
<p>But again, the challenge is to <em>prove</em> that these involutes have cusps of order 5/2 where they hit the line <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y+%3D+0.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y = 0." class="latex" />   A cusp of order 7/2 would also have two branches that are convex on the same side!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s one more hint.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involute">Wikipedia</a> says that if we have a curve</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C+%3A%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D+%5Cto+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C :&#92;mathbb{R} &#92;to &#92;mathbb{R}^2" class="latex" /></p>
<p>parametrized by arclength, so</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7CC%5E%5Cprime%28s%29%7C%3D1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="|C^&#92;prime(s)|=1" class="latex" /></p>
<p>for all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="s," class="latex" /> then its involute is the curve</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D+%3A%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D+%5Cto+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="D :&#92;mathbb{R} &#92;to &#92;mathbb{R}^2" class="latex" /></p>
<p>given by</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D%28s%29+%3D+C%28s%29-+s+C%5E%5Cprime%28s%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="D(s) = C(s)- s C^&#92;prime(s) " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Strictly speaking, this must be <em>an</em> involute.  And it must somehow handle the funny situations I described, where the involute fails to be smooth.  I don&#8217;t know it does this.</p>

				<small>21 March, 2016</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>Greg Bernhardt runs an excellent website for discussing physics, math and other topics, called <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/">Physics Forums</a>.  He recently interviewed me there.  Since I used this opportunity to explain a bit about the Azimuth Project and network theory, I thought I&#8217;d reprint the interview here.  Here is <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/interview-mathematical-physicist-john-baez-part-2/">Part 2</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tell us about your experience with past projects like &#8220;This Week&#8217;s Finds in Mathematical Physics&#8221;.</strong></p>
<p>I was hired by U.C. Riverside back in 1989. I was lonely and bored, since Lisa was back on the other coast. So, I spent a lot of evenings on the computer.</p>
<p>We had the internet back then&#8212;this was shortly after stone tools were invented&#8212;but the world-wide web hadn&#8217;t caught on yet. So, I would read and write posts on &#8220;newsgroups&#8221; using a program called a &#8220;news server&#8221;. You have to imagine me sitting in front of an old green­-on­-black cathode ray tube monitor with a large floppy disk drive, firing up the old modem to hook up to the internet.</p>
<p>In 1993, I started writing a series of posts on the papers I&#8217;d read. I called it <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/TWF.html">&#8220;This Week&#8217;s Finds in Mathematical Physics&#8221;</a>, which was a big mistake, because I couldn&#8217;t really write one every week. After a while I started using it to explain lots of topics in math and physics. I wrote 300 issues. Then I quit in 2010, when I started taking climate change seriously.</p>
<p><strong>Share with us a bit about your current projects like Azimuth and the n­-Café.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/">The n­-Category Café</a> is a blog I started with Urs Schreiber and the philosopher David Corfield back in 2006, when all three of us realized that n­-categories are the big wave that math is riding right now. We have a bunch more bloggers on the team now. But the n­-Café lost some steam when I quit work in n­-categories and Urs started putting most of his energy into two related projects: a wiki called the <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/HomePage">nLab</a> and a discussion group called the <a href="https://nforum.ncatlab.org/">nForum</a>.</p>
<p>In 2010, when I noticed that global warming was like a huge wave crashing down on our civilization, I started the <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Azimuth+Project">Azimuth Project</a>. The goal was to create a focal point for scientists and engineers interested in saving the planet. It consists of a team of people, a <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/">blog</a>, a <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Azimuth+Library">wiki</a> and a <a href="https://forum.azimuthproject.org/discussions">discussion group</a>. It was very productive for a while: we wrote a lot of educational articles on climate science and energy issues. But lately I&#8217;ve realized I&#8217;m better at abstract math. So, I&#8217;ve been putting more time into working with my grad students.</p>
<p><strong>What about climate change has captured your interest?</strong></p>
<p>That&#8217;s like asking: &#8220;What about that huge tsunami rushing toward us has captured your interest?&#8221;</p>
<p>Around 2004 I started hearing news that sent chills up my spine ­ and what really worried me is how few people were talking about this news, at least in the US.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m talking about how we&#8217;re pushing the Earth&#8217;s climate out of the glacial cycle we&#8217;ve been in for over a million years, into brand new territory. I&#8217;m talking about things like how it takes hundreds or thousands of years for CO<sub>2</sub> to exit the atmosphere after it&#8217;s been put in. And I&#8217;m talking about how global warming is just part of a bigger phenomenon: the <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/balsillie/balsillie_what.pdf">Anthropocene</a>. That&#8217;s a new geological epoch, in which the biosphere is rapidly changing due to human influences. It&#8217;s not just the temperature:</p>
<p>• About <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/05/30/1211349110.abstract">1/4</a> of all chemical energy produced by plants is now used by humans.</p>
<p>• The rate of species going extinct is <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Extinction">100­&#8211;1000</a> times the usual background rate.</p>
<p>• Populations of large ocean fish have declined <a href="http://wormlab.biology.dal.ca/ramweb/papers-total/nature01610_r.pdf">90%</a> since 1950.</p>
<p>• Humans now take more nitrogen from the atmosphere and convert it into nitrates than <a href="http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art32/main.html#Interference">all other processes combined</a>.</p>
<p>• <a href="http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art32/main.html#Interference">8­-9</a> times as much phosphorus is flowing into oceans than the natural background rate.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t necessarily spell the end of our civilization, but it is something that we&#8217;ll all have to deal with.</p>
<p>So, I felt the need to alert people and try to dream up strategies to do something. That&#8217;s why in 2010 I quit work on n­-categories and started the Azimuth Project.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.globalwarmingart.com/wiki/File:Carbon_Dioxide_400kyr_Rev_png"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature/Carbon_Dioxide_400kyr_Rev.jpg" width="430" alt="Carbon Dioxide Variations" /></a></p>
<p><strong>You have life experience on both US coasts. Which do you prefer and why?</strong></p>
<p>There are some differences between the coasts, but they&#8217;re fairly minor. The West Coast is part of the Pacific Rim, so there&#8217;s more Asian influence here. The seasons are less pronounced here, because winds in the northern hemisphere blow from west to east, and the oceans serve as a temperature control system. Down south in Riverside it&#8217;s a semi­-desert, so we can eat breakfast in our back yard in January! But I live here not because I like the West Coast more. This just happens to be where my wife Lisa and I managed to get a job.</p>
<p>What I really like is getting out of the US and seeing the rest of the world. When you&#8217;re at cremation ritual in Bali, or a Hmong festival in Laos, the difference between regions of the US starts seeming pretty small.</p>
<p>But I wasn&#8217;t a born traveler. When I spent my first summer in England, I was very apprehensive about making a fool of myself. The British have different manners, and their old universities are full of arcane customs and subtle social distinctions that even the British find terrifying. But after a few summers there I got over it. First, all around the world, being American gives you a license to be clueless. If you behave any better than the worst stereotypes, people are impressed. Second, I spend most of my time with mathematicians, who are incredibly forgiving of bad social behavior as long as you know interesting theorems.</p>
<p>By now I&#8217;ve gotten to feel very comfortable in England. The last couple of years I&#8217;ve spent time at the quantum computation group at Oxford&#8211;the group run by Bob Coecke and Samson Abramsky. I like talking to Jamie Vicary about n­categories and physics, and also my old friend Minhyong Kim, who is a number theorist there.</p>
<p>I was also very apprehensive when I first visited Paris. Everyone talks about how the waiters are rude, and so on. But I think that&#8217;s an exaggeration. Yes, if you go to cafés packed with boorish tourists, the waiters will treat you like a boorish tourist&#8212;so don&#8217;t do that. If you go to quieter places and behave politely, most people are friendly. Luckily Lisa speaks French and has some friends in Paris; that opens up a lot of opportunities. I don&#8217;t speak French, so I always feel like a bit of an idiot, but I&#8217;ve learned to cope. I&#8217;ve spent a few summers there working with Paul­-André Melliès on category theory and logic.</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_8767" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/kong_kong_yau_ma_tei_market.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8767" class="size-full wp-image-8767" src="https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/kong_kong_yau_ma_tei_market.jpg" alt="Yau Ma Tei Market - Hong Kong" width="300" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-8767" class="wp-caption-text">Yau Ma Tei Market &#8211; Hong Kong</p></div>
<p>I was also intimidated when I first spent a summer in Hong Kong&#8212;and even more so when I spent a summer in Shanghai. Lisa speaks Chinese too: she&#8217;s more cultured than me, and she drags me to interesting places. My first day walking around Shanghai left me completely exhausted: everything was new! Walking down the street you see people selling frogs in a bucket, strange fungi and herbs, then a little phone shop where telephone numbers with lots of 8&#8217;s cost more, and so on: it&#8217;s a kind of cognitive assault.</p>
<p>But again, I came to enjoy it. And coming back to California, everything seemed a bit boring. Why is there so much land that&#8217;s not being used? Where are all the people? Why is the food so bland?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve spent the most time outside the US in Singapore. Again, that&#8217;s because my wife and I both got job offers there, not because it&#8217;s the best place in the world. Compared to China it&#8217;s rather sterile and manicured. But it&#8217;s still a fascinating place. They&#8217;ve pulled themselves up from a British colonial port town to a multi­cultural country that&#8217;s in some ways more technologically advanced than the US. The food is great: it&#8217;s a mix of Chinese, Indian, Malay and pretty much everything else. There&#8217;s essentially no crime: you can walk around in the darkest alley in the worst part of town at 3 am and still feel safe. It&#8217;s interesting to live in a country where people from very different cultures are learning to live together and prosper. The US considers itself a melting-pot, but in Singapore they have four national languages: English, Mandarin, Malay and Tamil.</p>
<p>Most of all, it&#8217;s great to live in places where the culture and politics is different than where I grew up. But I&#8217;m trying to travel less, because it&#8217;s bad for the planet.</p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;ve gained some fame for your &#8220;crackpot index&#8221;. What were your motivations for developing it? Any new criteria you&#8217;d add?</strong></p>
<p>After the internet first caught on, a bunch of us started using it to talk about physics on the usenet newsgroup sci.physics.</p>
<p>And then, all of a sudden, crackpots around the world started joining in!</p>
<p>Before this, I don&#8217;t think anybody realized how many people had their own personal theories of physics. You might have a crazy uncle who spent his time trying to refute special relativity, but you didn&#8217;t realize there were actually thousands of these crazy uncles.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;m sure you know here at Physics Forums, crackpots naturally tend to drive out more serious conversations. If you have some people talking about the laws of black hole thermodynamics, and some guy jumps in and says that the universe is a black hole, everyone will drop what they&#8217;re doing and argue with that guy. It&#8217;s irresistible. It reminds me of how when someone brings a baby to a party, everyone will start cooing to the baby. But it&#8217;s worse.</p>
<p>When physics crackpots started taking over the usenet newsgroup sci.physics, I discovered that they had a lot of features in common. The <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/crackpot.html">Crackpot Index</a> summarizes these common features. Whenever I notice a new pattern, I add it.</p>
<p>For example: if someone starts comparing themselves to Galileo and says the physics establishment is going after them like the Inquisition, I guarantee you that they&#8217;re a crackpot. Their theories could be right&#8212;but unfortunately, they&#8217;ve got delusions of grandeur and a persecution complex.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not being wrong that makes someone a crackpot. Being a full­-fledged crackpot is the endpoint of a tragic syndrome. Someone starts out being a bit too confident that they can revolutionize physics without learning it first. In fact, many young physicists go through this stage! But the good ones react to criticism by upping their game. The ones who become crackpots just brush it off. They come up with an idea that they think is great, and when nobody likes it, they don&#8217;t say &#8220;okay, I need to learn more.&#8221; Instead, they make up excuses: nobody understands me, maybe there&#8217;s a conspiracy at work, etc. The excuses get more complicated with each rebuff, and it gets harder and harder for them to back down and say &#8220;whoops, I was wrong&#8221;.</p>
<p>When I wrote the Crackpot Index, I thought crackpots were funny. Alexander Abian claimed all the world&#8217;s ills would be cured if we blew up the Moon. Archimedes Plutonium thinks the Universe is a giant plutonium atom. These ideas are funny. But now I realize how sad it is that someone can start with an passion for physics and end up in this kind of trap. They almost never escape.</p>
<p><strong>Who are some of your math and physics heroes of the past and of today?</strong></p>
<p>Wow, that&#8217;s a big question! I think every scientist needs to have heroes. I&#8217;ve had a lot.</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_21560" style="width: 210px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/marie_curie.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-21560"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-21560" src="https://johncarlosbaez.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/marie_curie.jpg?w=200" alt="Marie Curie" width="200" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-21560" class="wp-caption-text">Marie Curie</p></div>
<p>When I was a kid, I was in love with Marie Curie. I wanted to marry a woman like her: someone who really cared about science. She overcame huge obstacles to get a degree in physics, discovered not one but <em>two</em> new elements, often doing experiments in her own kitchen&#8212;and won not one but <em>two</em> Nobel prizes. She was a tragic figure in many ways. Her beloved husband Pierre, a great physicist in his own right, slipped and was run over by a horse­-drawn cart, dying instantly when the wheels ran over his skull. She herself probably died from her experiments with radiation. But this made me love her all the more.</p>
<p>Later my big hero was Einstein. How could any physicist <em>not</em> have Einstein as a hero? First he came up with the idea that light comes in discrete quanta: photons. Then, two months later, he used Brownian motion to figure out the size of atoms. One month after that: special relativity, unifying space and time! Three months later, the equivalence between mass and energy. And all this was just a warmup for his truly magnificent theory of general relativity, explaining gravity as the curvature of space and time. He truly transformed our vision of the Universe. And then, in his later years, the noble and unsuccessful search for a unified field theory. As a friend of mine put it, what matters here is not that he failed: what matters is that he set physics a new goal, more ambitious than any goal it had before.</p>
<p>Later it was Feynman. As I mentioned, my uncle gave me Feynman&#8217;s <em>Lectures on Physics</em>. This is how I first learned Maxwell&#8217;s equations, special relativity, quantum mechanics. His way of explaining things with a minimum of jargon, getting straight to the heart of every issue, is something I really admire. Later I enjoyed his books like <em>Surely You Must Be Joking</em>. Still later I learned enough to be impressed by his work on QED.</p>
<p>But when you read his autobiographical books, you can see that he was a bit too obsessed with pretending to be a fun­-loving ordinary guy. A fun­-loving ordinary guy who just happens to be smarter than everyone else. In short, a self­-absorbed showoff. He could also be pretty mean to women&#8212;and in that respect, Einstein was even worse. So our heroes should not be admired uncritically.</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_8770" style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/grothendieck.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8770" class="size-full wp-image-8770" src="https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/grothendieck.jpg" alt="Alexander Grothendieck" width="250" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-8770" class="wp-caption-text">Alexander Grothendieck</p></div>
<p>A good example is <a href="http://www.ams.org/notices/201504/rnoti-p373.pdf">Alexander Grothendieck</a>. I guess he&#8217;s my main math hero these days. To solve concrete problems like the Weil conjectures, he avoided brute force techniques and instead developed revolutionary new concepts that <em><a href="http://www.cwru.edu/artsci/phil/RisingSea.pdf">gently dissolved</a></em> those problems. And these new concepts turned out to be much more important than the problems that motivated him. I&#8217;m talking about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_category">abelian categories</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_%28mathematics%29">schemes</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topos">topoi</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_%28mathematics%29">stacks</a>, things like that. Everyone who really wants to understand math at a deep level has got to learn these concepts. They&#8217;re beautiful and wonderfully simple&#8212;but not easy to master. You have to really change your world view to understand them, just like general relativity or quantum mechanics. You have to rewire your neurons.</p>
<p>At his peak, Grothendieck seemed almost superhuman. It seems he worked almost all day and all night, bouncing his ideas off the other amazing French algebraic geometers. Apparently <em>20,000 pages</em> of his writings remain unpublished! But he became increasingly alienated from the mathematical establishment and eventually disappeared completely, hiding in a village near the Pyrenees.</p>
<p><strong>Which groundbreaking advances in science and math are you most looking forward to?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;d really like to see progress in figuring out the fundamental laws of physics. Ideally, I&#8217;d like to know the Theory of Everything. Of course, we don&#8217;t even know that there is one! There could be an endless succession of deeper and deeper realizations to be had about the laws of physics, with no final answer.</p>
<p>If we ever do discover the Theory of Everything, that won&#8217;t be the end of the story. It could be just the beginning. For example, next we could ask why this particular theory governs our Universe. Is it necessary, or contingent? People like to chat about this puzzle already, but I think it&#8217;s premature. I think we should find the Theory of Everything first.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, right now fundamental physics is in a phase of being &#8220;stuck&#8221;. I don&#8217;t expect to see the Theory of Everything in my lifetime. I&#8217;d be happy to see any progress at all! There are dozens of very basic things we don&#8217;t understand.</p>
<p>When it comes to math, I expect that people will have their hands full this century redoing the foundations using <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/infinity-category">∞-categories</a>, and answering some of the questions that come up when you do this. The crowd working on <a href="http://homotopytypetheory.org/book/">&#8220;homotopy type theory&#8221;</a> is making good progress&#8211;but so far they&#8217;re mainly thinking about <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/infinity-groupoid">∞-groupoids</a>, which are a very special sort of ∞-category. When we do all of math using ∞-categories, it will be a whole new ballgame.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s the question of whether humanity will figure out a way to keep from ruining the planet we live on. And the question of whether we&#8217;ll succeed in replacing ourselves with something more intelligent&#8212;or even wiser.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s something cool: red dwarf stars will keep burning for <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/timeline.html#future"><em>10 trillion years</em></a>. If we, or any civilization, can settle down next to one of those, there will be plenty of time to figure things out. That&#8217;s what I hope for.</p>
<p>But some of my friends think that life always uses up resources as fast as possible. So one of my big questions is whether intelligent life will develop the patience to sit around and think interesting thoughts, or whether it will burn up red dwarf stars and every other source of energy as fast as it can, as we&#8217;re doing now with fossil fuels.</p>
<p><strong>What does the future hold for John Baez? What are your goals?</strong></p>
<p>What the future holds for me, primarily, is death.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s true of all of us&#8212;or at least most of us. While some hope that technology will bring immortality, or at least a much longer life, I bet most of us are headed for death fairly soon. So I try to make the most of the time I have.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m always re­-evaluating what I should do. I used to spend time thinking about quantum gravity and n­-categories. But quantum gravity feels stuck, and n­-category theory is shooting forward so fast that my help is no longer needed.</p>
<p>Climate change is hugely important, and nobody really knows what to do about it. Lots of people are trying lots of different things. Unfortunately I&#8217;m no better than the rest when it comes to the most obvious strategies&#8212;like politics, or climate science, or safer nuclear reactors, or better batteries and photocells.</p>
<p>The trick is finding things you can do better than other people. Right now for me that means thinking about networks and biology in a very abstract way. I&#8217;m inspired by this remark by Patten and Witkamp:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>To understand ecosystems, ultimately will be to understand networks.</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>So that&#8217;s my goal for the next five years or so.  It&#8217;s probably not be the best thing <em>anyone</em> can do to prepare for the Middle Anthropocene. But it may be the best thing <em>I</em> can do: use the math I know to help people understand the biosphere.</p>
<p>It may seem like I keep jumping around: from quantum gravity to n-categories to biology.  But I keep wanting to think about networks, and how they change in time.</p>
<p>At some point I hope to retire and become a bit more of a self­-indulgent wastrel. I could write a fun book about group theory in geometry and physics, and a fun book about the octonions. I might even get around to spending more time on music!</p>

				<small>18 March, 2016</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>Greg Bernhardt runs an excellent website for discussing physics, math and other topics, called <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/">Physics Forums</a>. He recently interviewed me there. Since I used this opportunity to explain a bit about the Azimuth Project and network theory, I thought I&#8217;d reprint the interview here. Here is <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/interview-mathematical-physicist-john-baez-part-1/">Part 1</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Give us some background on yourself.</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m interested in all kinds of mathematics and physics, so I call myself a mathematical physicist. But I&#8217;m a math professor at the University of California in Riverside. I&#8217;ve taught here since 1989. My wife Lisa Raphals got a job here nine years later: among other things, she studies classical Chinese and Greek philosophy.</p>
<p>I got my bachelors&#8217;s degree in math at Princeton. I did my <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/recursivity.pdf">undergrad thesis</a> on whether you can use a computer to solve Schrödinger&#8217;s equation to arbitrary accuracy. In the end, it became obvious that you can. I was really interested in mathematical logic, and I used some in my thesis&#8212;the theory of computable functions&#8212;but I decided it wasn&#8217;t very helpful in physics. When I read the magnificently poetic last chapter of Misner, Thorne and Wheeler&#8217;s <em>Gravitation</em>, I decided that quantum gravity was the problem to work on.</p>
<p>I went to math grad school at MIT, but I didn&#8217;t find anyone to work with on quantum gravity. So, I did my thesis on quantum field theory with Irving Segal. He was one of the founders of <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/bsz.html">&#8220;constructive quantum field theory&#8221;</a>, where you try to rigorously prove that quantum field theories make mathematical sense and obey certain axioms that they should. This was a hard subject, and I didn&#8217;t accomplish much, but I learned a lot.</p>
<p>I got a postdoc at Yale and switched to <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/rev.pdf">classical field theory</a>, mainly because it was something I could do. On the side I was still trying to understand quantum gravity. String theory was bursting into prominence at the time, and my life would have been easier if I&#8217;d jumped onto that bandwagon. But I didn&#8217;t like it, because most of the work back then studied strings moving on a fixed &#8220;background&#8221; spacetime. Quantum gravity is supposed to be about how the geometry of spacetime is variable and quantum­-mechanical, so I didn&#8217;t want a theory of quantum gravity set on a pre­-existing background geometry!</p>
<p>I got a professorship at U.C. Riverside based on my work on classical field theory. But at a conference on that subject in Seattle, I heard Abhay Ashtekar, Chris Isham and Renate Loll give some really interesting talks on loop quantum gravity. I don&#8217;t know why they gave those talks at a conference on classical field theory. But I&#8217;m sure glad they did! I liked their work because it was background­-free and mathematically rigorous. So I started work on loop quantum gravity.</p>
<p>Like many other theories, quantum gravity is easier in low dimensions. I became interested in how category theory lets you formulate quantum gravity in a universe with just 3 spacetime dimensions. It amounts to a radical new conception of space, where the geometry is described in a thoroughly quantum­-mechanical way. Ultimately, space is a quantum superposition of <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9504036">&#8220;spin networks&#8221;</a>, which are like Feynman diagrams. The idea is roughly that a spin network describes a virtual process where particles move around and interact. If we know how likely each of these processes is, we know the geometry of space.</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_8752" style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/spin_network.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8752" class="size-full wp-image-8752" src="https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/spin_network.jpg" alt="A spin network" width="250" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-8752" class="wp-caption-text">A spin network</p></div>
<p>Loop quantum gravity tries to do the same thing for full­-fledged quantum gravity in 4 spacetime dimensions, but it doesn&#8217;t work as well. Then Louis Crane had an exciting idea: maybe 4­-dimensional quantum gravity needs a more sophisticated structure: a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-category">&#8220;2­-category&#8221;</a>.</p>
<p>I had never heard of 2­-categories. Category theory is about things and processes that turn one thing into another. In a 2­-category we also have &#8220;meta-processes&#8221; that turn one <em>process</em> into another.</p>
<p>I became very excited about 2-­categories. At the time I was so dumb I didn&#8217;t consider the possibility of 3­-categories, and 4­-categories, and so on. To be precise, I was more of a mathematical physicist than a mathematician: I wasn&#8217;t trying to develop math for its own sake. Then someone named James Dolan told me about n­-categories! That was a real eye­-opener. He came to U.C. Riverside to work with me. So I started thinking about <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/history.pdf">n­-categories</a> in parallel with loop quantum gravity.</p>
<p>Dolan was technically my grad student, but I probably learned more from him than vice versa. In 1996 we wrote a paper called <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/q-alg/9503002">&#8220;Higher­-dimensional algebra and topological quantum field theory&#8221;</a>, which might be my best paper. It&#8217;s full of grandiose guesses about n-­categories and their connections to other branches of math and physics. We had this vision of how everything fit together. It was so beautiful, with so much evidence supporting it, that we knew it had to be true. Unfortunately, at the time nobody had come up with a good <em>definition</em> of n­-category, except for n &lt; 4. So we called our guesses &#8220;hypotheses&#8221; instead of &#8220;conjectures&#8221;. In math a conjecture should be something utterly precise: it&#8217;s either true or not, with no room for interpretation.</p>
<p>By now, I think everybody more or less believes our hypotheses. Some of the easier ones have already been turned into theorems. Jacob Lurie, a young hotshot at Harvard, improved the statement of one and wrote a 111-page <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.0465">outline of a proof</a>. Unfortunately he still used some concepts that hadn&#8217;t been defined. People are working to fix that, and I feel sure they&#8217;ll succeed.</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_8762" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/foam.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8762" class="size-full wp-image-8762" src="https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/foam.jpg" alt="A foam of soap bubbles" width="300" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-8762" class="wp-caption-text">A foam of soap bubbles</p></div>
<p>Anyway, I kept trying to connect these ideas to quantum gravity. In 1997, I introduced <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9709052">&#8220;spin foams&#8221;</a>. These are structures like spin networks, but with an extra dimension. Spin networks have vertices and edges. Spin foams also have 2­-dimensional faces: imagine a foam of soap bubbles.</p>
<p>The idea was to use spin foams to give a purely quantum­-mechanical description of the geometry of spacetime, just as spin networks describe the geometry of space. But mathematically, what we&#8217;re doing here is going from a category to a 2­-category.</p>
<p>By now, there are a number of different theories of quantum gravity based on spin foams. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s not clear that any of them really work. In 2002, Dan Christensen, Greg Egan and I did <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0208010">a bunch of supercomputer calculations</a> to study this question. We showed that the most popular spin foam theory at the time gave dramatically different answers than people had hoped for. I think we more or less killed that theory.</p>
<p>That left me rather depressed. I don&#8217;t enjoy programming: indeed, Christensen and Egan did all the hard work of that sort on our paper. I didn&#8217;t want to spend years sifting through spin foam theories to find one that works. And most of all, I didn&#8217;t want to end up as an old man still not knowing if my work had been worthwhile! To me n­-category theory was clearly the math of the future&#8212;and it was easy for me to come up with cool new ideas in that subject. So, I quit quantum gravity and switched to n­-categories.</p>
<p>But this was very painful. Quantum gravity is a kind of &#8220;holy grail&#8221; in physics. When you work on that subject, you wind up talking to lots of people who believe that unifying quantum mechanics and general relativity is the most important thing in the world, and that nothing else could possibly be as interesting. You wind up believing it. It took me years to get out of that mindset.</p>
<p>Ironically, when I quit quantum gravity, I felt free to explore string theory. As a branch of math, it&#8217;s really wonderful. I started looking at how n­-categories apply to string theory. It turns out there&#8217;s a wonderful story here: briefly, particles are to categories as strings are to 2­-categories, and all the math of particles can be generalized to strings using this idea! I worked out a bit of this story with <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0511710">Urs Schreiber</a> and <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.3385">John Huerta</a>.</p>
<p>Around 2010, I felt I had to switch to working on environmental issues and math related to engineering and biology, for the sake of the planet. That was another painful renunciation. But luckily, <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/homotopy-lie-n-algebras-supergravity/">Urs Schreiber and others</a> are continuing to work on n­-categories and string theory, and doing it better than I ever could. So I don&#8217;t feel the need to work on those things anymore&#8212;indeed, it would be hard to keep up. I just follow along quietly from the sidelines.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s quite possible that we need a dozen more good ideas before we really get anywhere on quantum gravity. But I feel confident that n­-categories will have a role to play. So, I&#8217;m happy to have helped push that subject forward.</p>
<p><strong>Your uncle, Albert Baez, was a physicist. How did he help develop your interests?</strong></p>
<p>He had a huge effect on me. He&#8217;s mainly famous for being the father of the folk singer Joan Baez. But he started out in optics and helped invent the first X­-ray microscope. Later he became very involved in physics education, especially in what were then called third­-world countries. For example, in 1951 he helped set up a physics department at the University of Baghdad.</p>

<p>When I was a kid he worked for UNESCO, so he&#8217;d come to Washington D.C. and stay with my parents, who lived nearby. Whenever he showed up, he would open his suitcase and pull out amazing gadgets: diffraction gratings, holograms, and things like that. And he would explain how they work! I decided physics was the coolest thing there is.</p>
<p>When I was eight, he gave me a copy of his book <em>The New College Physics: A Spiral Approach</em>. I immediately started trying to read it. The &#8220;spiral approach&#8221; is a great pedagogical principle: instead of explaining each topic just once, you should start off easy and then keep spiraling around from topic to topic, examining them in greater depth each time you revisit them. So he not only taught me physics, he taught me about how to learn and how to teach.</p>
<p>Later, when I was fifteen, I spent a couple weeks at his apartment in Berkeley. He showed me the Lawrence Hall of Science, which is where I got my first taste of programming&#8212;in BASIC, with programs stored on paper tape. This was in 1976. He also gave me a copy of <a href="http://www.feynmanlectures.info/"><em>The Feynman Lectures on Physics</em></a>. And so, the following summer, when I was working at a state park building trails and such, I was also trying to learn quantum mechanics from the third volume of <em>The Feynman Lectures</em>. The other kids must have thought I was a complete geek&#8212;which of course I was.</p>
<p><strong>Give us some insight on what your average work day is like.</strong></p>
<p>During the school year I teach two or three days a week. On days when I teach, that&#8217;s the focus of my day: I try to prepare my classes starting at breakfast. Teaching is lots of fun for me. Right now I&#8217;m teaching two courses: an undergraduate course on game theory and a graduate course on category theory. I&#8217;m also running a seminar on category theory. In addition, I meet with my graduate students for a four­-hour session once a week: they show me what they&#8217;ve done, and we try to push our research projects forward.</p>
<p>On days when I don&#8217;t teach, I spend a lot of time writing. I love blogging, so I could easily do that all day, but I try to spend a lot of time writing actual papers. Any given paper starts out being tough to write, but near the end it practically writes itself. At the end, I have to tear myself away from it: I keep wanting to add more. At that stage, I feel an energetic glow at the end of a good day spent writing. Few things are so satisfying.</p>
<p>During the summer I don&#8217;t teach, so I can get a lot of writing done. I spent two years doing research at the <a href="http://www.quantumlah.org/index.php">Centre of Quantum Technologies</a>, which is in Singapore, and since 2012 I&#8217;ve been working there during summers. Sometimes I bring my grad students, but mostly I just write.</p>
<p>I also spend plenty of time doing things with my wife, like talking, cooking, shopping, and working out at the gym. We like to watch TV shows in the evening, mainly mysteries and science fiction.</p>
<p>We also do a lot of gardening. When I was younger that seemed boring ­ but as you get older, subjective time speeds up, so you pay more attention to things like plants growing. There&#8217;s something tremendously satisfying about planting a small seedling, watching it grow into an orange tree, and eating its fruit for breakfast.</p>
<p>I love playing the piano and recording electronic music, but doing it well requires big blocks of time, which I don&#8217;t always have. Music is pure delight, and if I&#8217;m not listening to it I&#8217;m usually composing it in my mind.</p>
<p>If I gave in to my darkest urges and becames a decadent wastrel I might spend all day blogging, listening to music, recording music and working on pure math. But I need other things to stay sane.</p>
<p><strong>What research are you working on at the moment?</strong></p>
<p>Lately I&#8217;ve been trying to finish a paper called <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/struggles-continuum-part-1/">&#8220;Struggles with the Continuum&#8221;</a>. It&#8217;s about the problems physics has with infinities, due to the assumption that spacetime is a continuum. At certain junctures this paper became psychologically difficult to write, since it&#8217;s supposed to include a summary of quantum field theory, which is complicated and sprawling subject. So, I&#8217;ve resorted to breaking this paper into blog articles and posting them on Physics Forums, just to motivate myself.</p>
<p>Purely for fun, I&#8217;ve been working with Greg Egan on some projects involving the octonions. The <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/octonions/">octonions</a> are a number system where you can add, subtract, multiply and divide. Such number systems only exist in 1, 2, 4, and 8 dimensions: you&#8217;ve got the real numbers, which form a line, the complex numbers, which form a plane, the quaternions, which are 4­-dimensional, and the octonions, which are 8­dimensional. The octonions are the biggest, but also the weirdest. For example, multiplication of octonions violates the associative law: <i>(xy)z</i> is not equal to <i>x(yz)</i>. So the octonions sound completely crazy at first, but they turn out to have fascinating connections to string theory and other things. They&#8217;re pretty addictive, and if became a decadent wastrel I would spend a lot more time on them.</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_8815" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/4_21_t0_E6.svg_.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8815" class="size-full wp-image-8815" src="https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/4_21_t0_E6.svg_.png" alt="The integral octonions of norm 1, projected onto a plane" width="300" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-8815" class="wp-caption-text">The 240 unit integral octonions, projected onto a plane</p></div>
<p>There&#8217;s a concept of &#8220;integer&#8221; for the octonions, and integral octonions form a lattice, a repeating pattern of points, in 8 dimensions. This is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E8_lattice">E<sub>8</sub> lattice</a>. There&#8217;s another lattices that lives in in 24 dimensions, called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leech_lattice">&#8220;Leech lattice&#8221;</a>. Both are connected to string theory. Notice that 8+2 equals 10, the dimension superstrings like to live in, and 24+2 equals 26, the dimension bosonic strings like to live in. That&#8217;s not a coincidence! The 2 here comes from the 2­-dimensional world-sheet of the string.</p>
<p>Since 3×8 is 24, Egan and I became interested in how you could built the Leech lattice from 3 copies of the E<sub>8</sub> lattice. People already knew a trick for doing it, but it took us a while to understand how it worked&#8212;and then Egan showed you could do this trick in <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2014/12/integral_octonions_part_11.html">exactly 17,280 ways</a>! I want to write up the proof. There&#8217;s a lot of beautiful geometry here.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s something really exhilarating about struggling to reach the point where you have some insight into these structures and how they&#8217;re connected to physics.</p>
<p>My main work, though, involves <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/">using category theory to study networks</a>. I&#8217;m interested in networks of all kinds, from electrical circuits to neural networks to &#8220;chemical reaction networks&#8221; and many more. Different branches of science and engineering focus on different kinds of networks. But there&#8217;s not enough communication between researchers in different subjects, so it&#8217;s up to mathematicians to set up a unified theory of networks.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got seven grad students working on this project&#8212;or actually eight, if you count Brendan Fong: I&#8217;ve been helping him on his dissertation, but he&#8217;s actually a student at Oxford.</p>
<p>Brendan was the first to join the project. I wanted him to work on electrical circuits, which are a nice familiar kind of network, a good starting point. But he went much deeper: he developed a <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/05/01/decorated-cospans/">general category­-theoretic framework for studying networks</a>. We then <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/04/28/a-compositional-framework-for-passive-linear-networks/">applied it to electrical circuits</a>, and other things as well.</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_8766" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/blake-brendan_big.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8766" class="size-full wp-image-8766" src="https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/blake-brendan_big.jpg" alt="Blake Pollard and Brendan Fong at the Centre for Quantum Technologies" width="300" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-8766" class="wp-caption-text">Blake Pollard and Brendan Fong at the Centre for Quantum Technologies</p></div>
<p>Blake Pollard is a student of mine in the physics department here at U. C. Riverside. Together with Brendan and me, he developed a <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/09/04/a-compositional-framework-for-markov-processes/">category­-theoretic approach to Markov processes</a>: random processes where a system hops around between different states. We used Brendan&#8217;s general formalism to reduce Markov processes to electrical circuits. Now Blake is going further and using these ideas to tackle chemical reaction networks.</p>
<p>My other students are in the math department at U. C. Riverside. Jason Erbele is working on &#8220;control theory&#8221;, a branch of engineering where you try to design feedback loops to make sure processes run in a stable way. Control theory uses networks called &#8220;signal flow diagrams&#8221;, and Jason has worked out <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/04/23/categories-in-control-2/">how to understand these using category theory</a>.</p>

<p>Jason isn&#8217;t using Brendan&#8217;s framework: he&#8217;s using a different one, called <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/PROP">PROPs</a>, which were developed a long time ago for use in algebraic topology. My student Franciscus Rebro has been developing it further, for use in our project. It gives a nice way to describe networks in terms of their basic building blocks. It also illuminates the similarity between signal flow diagrams and Feynman diagrams! They&#8217;re very similar, but there&#8217;s a big difference: in signal flow diagrams the signals are classical, while Feynman diagrams are quantum­-mechanical.</p>
<p>My student Brandon Coya has been working on electrical circuits. He&#8217;s sort of continuing what Brendan started, and <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.02307">unifying Brendan&#8217;s formalism with PROPs</a>.</p>
<p>My student Adam Yassine is starting to work on networks in classical mechanics. In classical mechanics you usually consider a single system: you write down the Hamiltonian, you get the equations of motion, and you try to solve them. He&#8217;s working on a setup where you can take lots of systems and hook them up into a network.</p>
<p>My students Kenny Courser and Daniel Cicala are digging deeper into another aspect of network theory. As I hinted earlier, a category is about things and processes that turn one thing into another. In a 2­-category we also have &#8220;meta-processes&#8221; that turn one process into another. We&#8217;re starting to bring 2­-categories into network theory.</p>
<p>For example, you can use categories to describe an electrical circuit as a process that turns some inputs into some outputs. You put some currents in one end and some currents come out the other end. But you can also use 2­-categories to describe &#8220;meta-processes&#8221; that turn one electrical circuit into another. An example of a meta-process would be a way of simplifying an electrical circuit, like replacing two resistors in series by a single resistor.</p>
<p>Ultimately I want to push these ideas in the direction of biochemistry. Biology seems complicated and &#8220;messy&#8221; to physicists and mathematicians, but I think there must be a beautiful logic to it. It&#8217;s full of networks, and these networks change with time. So, 2­-categories seem like a natural language for biology.</p>
<p>It won&#8217;t be easy to convince people of this, but that&#8217;s okay.</p>

<p>My grad students and I have been using a lot of category theory in our work on <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/">networks in engineering, chemistry and biology</a>.  So I decided to teach an introductory course on category theory, and it was surprisingly popular: 25 grad students registered for it!  Clearly there&#8217;s a lot of interest in the subject, and we don&#8217;t regularly teach a course on it at U. C. Riverside.</p>
<p>Here are the notes from my course.  In my earlier fall <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/qg-fall2015">Fall 2015</a> seminar, I had tried to explain how category theory unifies mathematics, without getting into lots of technical details.  This time I tried to give a systematic introduction to the subject, leading up to a little taste of topos theory.  But many proofs were offloaded to another more informal seminar, for which notes are not available.</p>
<p>When I started teaching this course, I imagined that the notes might someday grow into a book I&#8217;d always dreamt of: an introduction to category theory that includes lots of examples, talks to the reader in a friendly way, and explains what&#8217;s &#8216;really going on&#8217;.  However, while teaching the course, I noticed that Emily Riehl has written a book like this, probably better than I ever could.  Even better, her book is free online and will be published by Dover:</p>
<p>&bull; Emily Riehl, <a href="http://www.math.jhu.edu/~eriehl/727/context.pdf"><i>Category Theory in Context</i></a>, 2014.</p>
<p>So, I don’t feel much urge to write that book anymore. But there might still be room for a more quirky book on category theory that only I could write. It would probably need to include not only this &#8216;standard&#8217; material but more on applications.</p>
<p>If you discover any errors in the notes please email me, and I&#8217;ll  add them to the <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/qg-winter2016/errata.html">list of errors</a>.</p>

<p>Or, you can look at individual weeks:</p>
<p>Week 1 (Jan. 5 and 7) &#8211; The definition of a category.  Some familiar categories.  Various kinds of categories, including monoids, groupoids, groups, preorders, equivalence relations and posets.  The definition of a functor.  Doing mathematics inside a category: isomorphisms, monomorphisms and epimorphisms.</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/qg-winter2016/w16week01_osborne.pdf">Christina Osborne&#8217;s notes</a>.</p>
<p>Week 2 (Jan. 12 and 14) &#8211; Doing mathematics inside a category: an isomorphism is a monomorphism and epimorphism, but not necessarily conversely.  Products.  Any object isomorphic to a product can also be a product.  Products are unique up to isomorphism.  Coproducts.  What products and coproducts are like in various familiar categories.  General limits and colimits.   Examples: products and coproducts, equalizers and coequalizers, pullbacks and pushouts, terminal and initial objects.</p>

<p>Week 3 (Jan. 19 and 21) &#8211; Equalizers and coequalizers, and what they look like in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BSet%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Set}" class="latex" /> and other familiar categories. Pullbacks and pushouts, and what they look like in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BSet%7D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Set}." class="latex" /> Composing pullback squares.</p>

<p>Week 4 (Jan. 26 and 28) &#8211; Doing mathematics between categories. Faithful, full, and essentially surjective functors.  Forgetful functors: what it means for a functor to forget nothing, forget properties, forget structure or forget stuff.  Transformations between functors.  Natural transformations.  Functor categories.  Natural isomorphisms.  In a category with binary products, the product becomes a functor, and the commutative and associative laws hold up to natural isomorphism.  Cartesian categories.  In a cartesian category, the left and right unit laws also hold up to natural isomorphism.  A <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="G" class="latex" />-set is a functor from a group <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="G" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BSet%7D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Set}." class="latex" />  What is a natural transformation between such functors?</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/qg-winter2016/w16week04_osborne.pdf">Christina Osborne&#8217;s notes</a>.</p>
<p>Week 5 (Feb. 2 and 4) &#8211; A <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="G" class="latex" />-set is a functor from a group <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="G" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BSet%7D%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Set}," class="latex" /> and a natural transformation between such functors is a map of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="G" class="latex" />-sets.  Equivalences of categories.  Adjoint functors: the rough idea.  The hom-functor.  Adjoint functors: the definition. Examples: the left adjoint of the forgetful functor from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BGrp%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Grp}" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BSet%7D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Set}." class="latex" />  The left adjoint of the forgetful functor from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BVect%7D_k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Vect}_k" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BSet%7D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Set}." class="latex" />  The forgetful functor from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BTop%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Top}" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BSet%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Set}" class="latex" /> has both a left and right adjoint.  If a category <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C" class="latex" /> has binary products, the diagonal functor from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C+%5Ctimes+C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C &#92;times C" class="latex" /> has a right adjoint.  If it has binary coproducts, the diagonal functor has a left adjoint.</p>

<p>Week 6 (Feb. 9 and 11) &#8211; Diagrams in a category as functors.  Cones as natural transformations.  The process of taking limits  as a right adjoint.  The process of taking colimits as a left adjoint. Left adjoints preserve colimits; right adjoints preserve limits. Examples: the &#8216;free group&#8217; functor from sets to groups preserve coproducts, while the forgetful functor from groups to sets preserves products. The composite of left adjoints is a left adjoint; the composite of right adjoints is a right adjoint.  The unit and counit of a pair of adjoint functors.</p>

<p>Week 7 (Feb. 16 and 18) &#8211; Adjunctions.  The naturality of the isomorphism <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7Bhom%7D%28Fc%2Cd%29+%5Ccong+%5Ctextrm%7Bhom%7D%28c%2CUd%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{hom}(Fc,d) &#92;cong &#92;textrm{hom}(c,Ud)" class="latex" /> in an adjunction. Given  an adjunction, we can recover this isomorphism and its inverse from the unit and counit.  Toward topos theory: cartesian closed categories and subobject classifiers.  The definition of cartesian closed category, or &#8216;ccc&#8217;.  Examples of cartesian closed categories.  In a cartesian closed category with coproducts, the product distributes over the coproduct, and exponentiation distributes over the product.</p>

The intersection of subsets of is their product in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BSub%7D%28X%29%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Sub}(X)," class="latex" /> their union is their coproduct in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BSub%7D%28X%29%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Sub}(X)," class="latex" /> the set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> is the terminal object in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BSub%7D%28X%29%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Sub}(X)," class="latex" /> and the empty set is the initial object.  A lattice is a poset with finite limits and finite colimits, and a Heyting algebra is a lattice that is also cartesian closed.  For any object <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> in any topos, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BSub%7D%28X%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Sub}(X)" class="latex" /> is a Heyting algebra. If we think of these elements of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BSub%7D%28X%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Sub}(X)" class="latex" /> as predicates, the exponential is &#8216;implication&#8217;.</p>
<p>Where does topos theory go from here?</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/qg-winter2016/w16week10_osborne.pdf">Christina Osborne&#8217;s notes</a>.</p>
<p>All the notes are handwritten, by Christina Osborne and Samuel Britton. I&#8217;d consider paying someone to TeX them up! But as you see, there are a lot of diagrams&#8230;. so you should only try it if you want to learn category theory while practicing your TikZ. And if you try it, you should let us know &#8211; it would be silly to have more than one person doing the same job, while chopping the job into parts might work well.</p>

				<small>6 March, 2016</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<div align="center"><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/capricornoid_1.png"><img width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/capricornoid_1.png" /></a></div>
<p>This curve is called a <b><a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Capricornoid.html">capricornoid</a></b>, because it&#8217;s supposed to resemble the sign of Capricorn in the zodiac, though I don&#8217;t see how.  Its equation is</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E2+%28x%5E2%2By%5E2%29+-+4+%28y-x%5E2-y%5E2%29%5E2+%3D+0+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x^2 (x^2+y^2) - 4 (y-x^2-y^2)^2 = 0 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>so it&#8217;s described by a quartic equation in two variables.</p>
<p>What makes this curve fun is that it has two different kinds of singularities.  At the point</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2Cy%29+%3D+%280%2C0%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(x,y) = (0,0)" class="latex" /></p>
<p>it has a <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacnode">tacnode</a></b>, meaning that two different branches of the curve are tangent at that point.  More precisely, two different circles <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osculating_circle">kiss</a> the curve at that point.</p>
<p>Further up, at the point</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2Cy%29+%3D+%280%2C1%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(x,y) = (0,1)" class="latex" /></p>
<p>there is a <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crunode">crunode</a></b>, meaning that two different branches of the curve cross each other, but are not tangent.  The word &#8216;crunode&#8217; is a bit old-fashioned: usually people call a point like this an <b>ordinary double point</b>.</p>
<p>The simplest example of a tacnode is the curve</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28y+-+x%5E2%29%28y+%2B+x%5E2%29+%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(y - x^2)(y + x^2) = 0" class="latex" /></p>
<p>This consists of a parabola and an upside-down parabola that are tangent at the origin: the tacnode is at the origin.</p>
<p>The basic example of an ordinary double point for a curve in the plane is</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=xy+%3D+0+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="xy = 0 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>This consists of two lines that cross at the origin: the ordinary double point is at the origin. This is, in some obvious sense, a simpler singularity than the tacnode.  But can we make this obvious sense precise?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Du_Val_singularity">amazing classification</a> of singularities for surfaces in terms of ADE Dynkin diagrams, and V. I Arnol&#8217;d used a variant to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacnode#More_general_background">classify certain singularities of curves</a>.  For example, the curve</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E2+-+y%5E%7Bn%2B1%7D+%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x^2 - y^{n+1} = 0" class="latex" /></p>
<p>is said to have singularity of <b>type A<sub><i>n</i></sub></b> at the origin.  If we take <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%3D+1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n = 1" class="latex" /> we get</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x+%2B+y%29%28x+-+y%29+%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(x + y)(x - y) = 0" class="latex" /></p>
<p>which has an ordinary double point at the origin: this is another way to draw two lines crossing.  If we take <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%3D+2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n = 2" class="latex" /> we get</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E2+-+y%5E3+%3D+0+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x^2 - y^3 = 0 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>which is the simplest example of a <b>spinode</b>.  Again this term is a bit old-fashioned: these days people call such a singularity a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cusp_%28singularity%29"><b>cusp</b></a>.</p>
<p>And if we take <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%3D+3%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n = 3," class="latex" /> we get</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x+%2B+y%5E2%29%28x+-+y%5E2%29+%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(x + y^2)(x - y^2) = 0" class="latex" /></p>
<p>which is the simplest example of a tacnode!</p>
<p>So, there&#8217;s a systematic way in which these singularities are getting more complicated:</p>
<p>• crunode (ordinary double point): <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E2+-+y%5E2+%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x^2 - y^2 = 0" class="latex" /><br />
• spinode (cusp) <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E2+-+y%5E3+%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x^2 - y^3 = 0" class="latex" /><br />
• tacnode <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E2+-+y%5E4+%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x^2 - y^4 = 0" class="latex" /></p>
<p>and the series goes on forever.</p>
<p>I drew the capricornoid using the <a href="http://www.sagemath.com/">SageMathCloud.</a>  Since I&#8217;m not very good at computing, I found myself cursing a few times in the process.  For example, this system seems to fall asleep if you don&#8217;t use it fast enough.  When it falls asleep, it forgets that you&#8217;ve declared variables&#8212;that is, told it that variables are variables.  Then it spews out obscure error messages.</p>
<p>But a more mathematically interesting reason for cursing is that it&#8217;s a bit hard to draw a tacnode!  I said that the curve shown above is a picture of</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E2+%28x%5E2%2By%5E2%29+-+4+%28y-x%5E2-y%5E2%29%5E2+%3D+0+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x^2 (x^2+y^2) - 4 (y-x^2-y^2)^2 = 0 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>but I was lying.  It&#8217;s actually a picture of</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E2+%28x%5E2%2By%5E2%29+-+4+%28y-x%5E2-y%5E2%29%5E2+%3D+-0.0001+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x^2 (x^2+y^2) - 4 (y-x^2-y^2)^2 = -0.0001 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>If I draw a picture of</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E2+%28x%5E2%2By%5E2%29+-+4+%28y-x%5E2-y%5E2%29%5E2+%3D+0+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x^2 (x^2+y^2) - 4 (y-x^2-y^2)^2 = 0 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>I get this:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/capricornoid_2.png"><img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/capricornoid_2.png" /></a></div>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t include the origin, so we don&#8217;t get the tacnode&#8212;due to some discretization effect or small numerical errors, I guess.  This says something interesting about what happens to a curve with a tacnode when you perturb it slightly!</p>
<p>All this is part of my slow and much belated plan to learn algebraic geometry.</p>
<p><b>Puzzle.</b>  Can you get the equation of the capricornoid by taking the equation of an ellipse</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%2Cy%29+%3D+0+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f(x,y) = 0 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>and the equation of another ellipse</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g%28x%2Cy%29+%3D+0+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="g(x,y) = 0 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>and multiplying them to get</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%2Cy%29+g%28x%2Cy%29+%3D+0+%3F+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f(x,y) g(x,y) = 0 ? " class="latex" /></p>

					<p>Category theory reduces a large chunk of math to the clever manipulation of arrows.   One of the fun things about this is that you can often take a familiar mathematical construction, think of it category-theoretically, and just <i>turn around all the arrows</i> to get something new and interesting!</p>
<p>In math we love functions.  If we have a function</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%3A+X+%5Cto+Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f: X &#92;to Y" class="latex" /></p>
<p>we can formally turn around the arrow to think of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" /> as something going back from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Y" class="latex" /> back to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" />.  But this something is usually not a function: it&#8217;s called a &#8216;cofunction&#8217;.  A <b>cofunction</b> from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Y" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> is simply a function from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Y." class="latex" /></p>
<p>Cofunctions are somewhat interesting, but they&#8217;re really just functions viewed through a looking glass, so they don&#8217;t give much new&#8212;at least, not by themselves.</p>
<p>The game gets more interesting if we think of functions and cofunctions as special sorts of relations.  A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_relation"><b>relation</b></a> from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Y" class="latex" /> is a subset</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R+%5Csubseteq+X+%5Ctimes+Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="R &#92;subseteq X &#92;times Y" class="latex" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a <b>function</b> when for each <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%5Cin+X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x &#92;in X" class="latex" /> there&#8217;s a unique <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y+%5Cin+Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y &#92;in Y" class="latex" /> with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2Cy%29+%5Cin+R.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(x,y) &#92;in R." class="latex" />  It&#8217;s a <b>cofunction</b> when for each <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y+%5Cin+Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y &#92;in Y" class="latex" /> there&#8217;s a unique <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%5Cin+x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x &#92;in x" class="latex" /> with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2Cy%29+%5Cin+R.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(x,y) &#92;in R." class="latex" /></p>
<p>Just as we can compose functions, we can compose relations.  Relations have certain advantages over functions: for example, we can &#8216;turn around&#8217; any relation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="R" class="latex" /> from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Y" class="latex" /> and get a relation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%5E%5Cdagger&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="R^&#92;dagger" class="latex" /> from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Y" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X%3A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X:" class="latex" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%5E%5Cdagger+%3D+%5C%7B%28y%2Cx%29+%3A+%5C%3B+%28x%2Cy%29+%5Cin+R+%5C%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="R^&#92;dagger = &#92;{(y,x) : &#92;; (x,y) &#92;in R &#92;} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>If we turn around a function we get a cofunction, and vice versa.  But we can also do other fun things: for example, since both functions and cofunctions are relations, we can compose a function and a cofunction and get a relation.</p>
<p>Of course, relations also have certain <i>disadvantages</i> compared to functions.  But it&#8217;s utterly clear by now that the category <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BFinRel%7D%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{FinRel}," class="latex" /> where the objects are finite sets and the morphisms are relations, is very important.</p>
<p>So far, so good.  But what happens if we take the definition of &#8216;relation&#8217; and turn all the arrows around?</p>
<p>There are actually several things I could mean by this question, some more interesting than others.  But one of them gives a very interesting new concept: the concept of &#8216;corelation&#8217;.  And two of my students have just written a very nice paper on corelations:</p>
<p>&bull; Brandon Coya and Brendan Fong, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.02307">Corelations are the prop for extraspecial commutative Frobenius monoids</a>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s why this paper is important for network theory: corelations between finite sets are exactly what we need to describe electrical circuits made of ideal conductive wires!  A corelation from a finite set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> to a finite set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Y" class="latex" /> can be drawn this way:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/corelation/corelation_1.jpg" />
</div>
<p>I have drawn more wires than strictly necessary: I&#8217;ve drawn a wire between two points whenever I want current to be able to flow between them.  But there&#8217;s a reason I did this: a corelation from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Y" class="latex" /> simply tells us when current can flow from one point in either of these sets to any other point in these sets.</p>
<p>Of course circuits made solely of conductive wires are not very exciting for electrical engineers.  But in an earlier paper, Brendan introduced corelations as an important stepping-stone toward more general circuits:</p>
<p>&bull; John Baez and Brendan Fong, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.05625">A compositional framework for passive linear circuits</a>.  (Blog article <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/04/28/a-compositional-framework-for-passive-linear-networks/">here</a>.)</p>
<p>The key point is simply that you use conductive wires to connect resistors, inductors, capacitors, batteries and the like and build interesting circuits&#8212;so if you don&#8217;t fully understand the math of conductive wires, you&#8217;re limited in your ability to understand circuits in general!</p>
<p>In their new paper, Brendan teamed up with Brandon Coya, and they figured out all the rules obeyed by the category <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BFinCorel%7D%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{FinCorel}," class="latex" /> where the objects are finite sets and the morphisms are corelations.   I&#8217;ll explain these rules later.</p>
<p>This sort of analysis had previously been done for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BFinRel%7D%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{FinRel}," class="latex" /> and it turns out there&#8217;s a beautiful analogy between the two cases!  Here is a chart displaying the analogy:</p>
<table border="1">
<tr>
<td align="center"><b>Spans</b></td>
<td align="center"><b>Cospans</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">extra bicommutative bimonoids</td>
<td align="center">special commutative Frobenius monoids</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"><b>Relations</b></td>
<td align="center"><b>Corelations</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">extraspecial bicommutative bimonoids</td>
<td align="center">extraspecial commutative Frobenius monoids</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>I&#8217;m sure this will be cryptic to the nonmathematicians reading this, and even many mathematicians&#8212;but the paper explains what&#8217;s going on here.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll actually say what an &#8216;extraspecial commutative Frobenius monoid&#8217; is later in this post.  This is a terse way of listing all the rules obeyed by corelations between finite sets&#8212;and thus, all the rules obeyed by conductive wires.</p>
<p>But first, let&#8217;s talk about something simpler.</p>
<h3> What is a corelation?  </h3>
<p>Just as we can define functions as relations of a special sort, we can also define relations in terms of functions.  A relation from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Y" class="latex" /> is a subset</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R+%5Csubseteq+X+%5Ctimes+Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="R &#92;subseteq X &#92;times Y" class="latex" /></p>
<p>but we can think of this as an equivalence class of one-to-one functions</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i%3A+R+%5Cto+X+%5Ctimes+Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i: R &#92;to X &#92;times Y" class="latex" /></p>
<p>Why an equivalence class?  The image of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i" class="latex" /> is our desired subset of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X+%5Ctimes+Y.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X &#92;times Y." class="latex" />  The set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="R" class="latex" /> here could be replaced by any isomorphic set; its only role is to provide &#8216;names&#8217; for the elements of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X+%5Ctimes+Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X &#92;times Y" class="latex" /> that are in the image of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i." class="latex" /></p>
<p>Now we have a relation described as an arrow, or really an equivalence class of arrows.  Next, let&#8217;s turn the arrow around!</p>
<p>There are different things I might mean by that, but we want to do it cleverly. When we turn arrows around, the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_%28category_theory%29">product</a> (for example, cartesian product <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X+%5Ctimes+Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X &#92;times Y" class="latex" /> of sets) turns into the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coproduct">sum</a> (for example, disjoint union <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X+%2B+Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X + Y" class="latex" /> of sets).   Similarly, the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomorphism">monomorphism</a> (such as a one-to-one function) turns into the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epimorphism">epimorphism</a> (such as an onto function).  If you don&#8217;t believe me, click on the links!</p>
<p>So, we should define a <b>corelation</b> from a set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> to a set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Y" class="latex" /> to be an equivalence class of onto functions</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%3A+X+%2B+Y+%5Cto+C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p: X + Y &#92;to C" class="latex" /></p>
<p>Why an equivalence class?  The set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C" class="latex" /> here could be replaced by any isomorphic set; its only role is to provide &#8216;names&#8217; for the sets of elements of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X+%2B+Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X + Y" class="latex" /> that get mapped to the same thing via <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p." class="latex" /></p>
<p>In simpler terms, a corelation from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> to a set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Y" class="latex" /> is just a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_a_set">partition</a> of the disjoint union <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X+%2B+Y.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X + Y." class="latex" />   So, it looks like this:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/corelation/corelation_3.jpg" />
</div>
<p>If we like, we can then draw a line connecting any two points that lie in the same part of the partition:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/corelation/corelation_2.jpg" />
</div>
<p>These lines determine the corelation, so we can also draw a corelation this way:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/corelation/corelation_1.jpg" />
</div>
<p>This is why corelations describe circuits made solely of wires!</p>
<h3> The rules governing corelations </h3>
<p>The main result in Brandon and Brendan&#8217;s paper is that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BFinCorel%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{FinCorel}" class="latex" /> is equivalent to the <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/PROP">PROP</a> for extraspecial commutative Frobenius monoids.  That&#8217;s a terse way of the laws governing <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BFinCorel%7D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{FinCorel}." class="latex" /></p>
<p>Let me just show you the most important laws.  In each of these law I&#8217;ll draw two circuits made of wires, and write an equals sign asserting that they give the same corelation from a set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> to a set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Y." class="latex" />   The inputs <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> of each circuit are on top, and the outputs <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Y" class="latex" /> are at the bottom.  I&#8217;ll draw 3-way junctions as little triangles, but don&#8217;t worry about that.   When we compose two corelations we may get a wire left in mid-air, not connected to the inputs or outputs.  We draw the end of the wire as a little circle.</p>
<p>There are some laws called the &#8216;commutative monoid&#8217; laws:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_commutative_monoid_dual.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p>and an upside-down version called the &#8216;cocommutative comonoid&#8217; laws:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_cocommutative_comonoid.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p>Then we have &#8216;Frobenius laws&#8217;:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="250" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_frobenius_duplication.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p>and finally we have the &#8216;special&#8217; and &#8216;extra&#8217; laws:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="220" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_extraspecial_duplication.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p>All other laws can be derived from these in some systematic ways.</p>
<p><a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Frobenius+algebra#commutative_frobenius_algebras">Commutative Frobenius monoids</a> obey the commutative monoid laws, the cocommutative comonoid laws and the Frobenius laws.  They play a fundamental role in 2d topological quantum field theory.  <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Frobenius+algebra#special_frobenius_algebras">Special Frobenius monoids</a> are also well-known.  But the &#8216;extra&#8217; law, which says that a little piece of wire not connected to anything can be thrown away with no effect, is less well studied.  Jason Erbele and I gave it this name in our work on control theory:</p>
<p>&bull; John Baez and Jason Erbele, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.6881">Categories in control</a>.  (Blog article <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/04/23/categories-in-control-2/">here</a>.)</p>
<h3> For more </h3>
<p>David Ellerman has spent a lot of time studying what would happen to mathematics if we turned around a lot of arrows in a certain systematic way.  In particular, just as the concept of relation would be replaced by the concept of corelation, the concept of subset would be replaced by the concept of partition.  You can see how it fits together: just as a relation from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Y" class="latex" /> is a subset of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X+%5Ctimes+Y%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X &#92;times Y," class="latex" /> a corelation from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Y" class="latex" /> is a partition of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X+%2B+Y.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X + Y." class="latex" /></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_%28order%29">lattice</a> of subsets of a set:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Hasse_diagram_of_powerset_of_3.svg/450px-Hasse_diagram_of_powerset_of_3.svg.png" /></div>
<p>In logic these subsets correspond to propositions, and the lattice operations are the logical operations &#8216;and&#8217; and &#8216;or&#8217;.  But there&#8217;s also a lattice of partitions of a set:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Set_partitions_4%3B_Hasse%3B_circles.svg/450px-Set_partitions_4%3B_Hasse%3B_circles.svg.png" />
</div>
<p>In Ellerman&#8217;s vision, this lattice of partitions gives a new kind of logic.  You can read about it here:</p>

<p>As mentioned, the main result in Brandon and Brendan&#8217;s paper is that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BFinCorel%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{FinCorel}" class="latex" /> is equivalent to the <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/PROP">PROP</a> for extraspecial commutative Frobenius monoids.  After they proved this, they noticed that the result has also been stated in other language and proved in other ways by two other authors:</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>&#8220;Every good key must be a model of the lock it opens.&#8221;</p>
<p>That sentence states an obvious fact, but perhaps also a profound insight if we interpret it generally enough.</p>
<p>That sentence is also the title of a paper:</p>
<p>&bull; Daniel L. Scholten, <a href="http://goodregulatorproject.org/images/Every_Good_Key_Must_Be_A_Model_Of_The_Lock_It_Opens.pdf">Every good key must be a model of the lock it opens (the Conant &amp; Ashby Theorem revisited)</a>, 2010.</p>
<p>Scholten gives a lot of examples, including these:</p>
<p>&bull; A key is a model of a lock’s keyhole.</p>
<p>&bull; A city street map is a model of the actual city streets</p>
<p>&bull; A restaurant menu is a model of the food the restaurant prepares and sells.</p>
<p>&bull; Honey bees use a kind of dance to model the location of a source of nectar.</p>
<p>&bull; An understanding of some phenomenon (for example a physicist’s understanding of lightning) is a mental model of the actual phenomenon.</p>
<p>This line of thought has an interesting application to control theory.  It suggests that <em>to do the best job of regulating some system, a control apparatus should include a model of that system</em>.</p>
<p>Indeed, much earlier, Conant and Ashby tried to turn this idea into a theorem, the &#8216;good regulator theorem&#8217;:</p>
<p>&bull; Roger C. Conant and W. Ross Ashby, <a href="http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Books/Conant_Ashby.pdf">Every good regulator of a system must be a model of that system)</a>, <i>International Journal of Systems Science</i> <b>1</b> (1970), 89&ndash;97.</p>
<p>Scholten&#8217;s paper is heavily based on this earlier paper.   He summarizes it as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  What all of this means, more or less, is that the pursuit of a goal by some dynamic agent (Regulator) in the face of a source of obstacles (System) places at least one particular and unavoidable demand on that agent, which is that the agent&#8217;s behaviors must be executed in such a reliable and predictable way that they can serve as a representation (Model) of that source of obstacles.
</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear that this is true, but it&#8217;s an appealing thought.</p>
<p>A particularly self-referential example arises when the regulator is some organism and the System is the world it lives in, <em>including itself</em>.   In this case, it seems the regulator should include a model of <em>itself!</em>  This would lead, ultimately, to self-awareness.</p>
<p>It all sounds great.  But Scholten raises an obvious question: if Conant and Ashby&#8217;s theorem is so great, why isn&#8217;t more well-known?   Scholten puts it quite vividly:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Given the preponderance of control-models that are used by humans (the evidence for this preponderance will be surveyed in the latter part of the paper), and especially given the obvious need to regulate that system, one might guess that the C&amp;A theorem would be at least as famous as, say, the Pythagorean Theorem (<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%5E2+%2B+b%5E2+%3D+c%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a^2 + b^2 = c^2" class="latex" />), the Einstein mass-energy equivalence (<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E+%3D+mc%5E2%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="E = mc^2," class="latex" /> which can be seen on T-shirts and bumper stickers), or the DNA double helix (which actually shows up in TV crime dramas and movies about super heroes). And yet, it would appear that relatively few lay-persons have ever even heard of C&amp;A’s important prerequisite to successful regulation.
</p></blockquote>
<p>There could be various explanations.  But here&#8217;s mine: when I tried to read Conant and Ashby&#8217;s paper, I got stuck.  They use some very basic mathematical notation in nonstandard ways, and they don&#8217;t clearly state the hypotheses and conclusion of their theorem.</p>
<p>Luckily, the paper is short, and the argument, while mysterious, seems simple.  So, I immediately felt I should be able to <em>dream up</em> the hypotheses, conclusion, and argument based on the hints given.</p>
<p>Scholten&#8217;s paper didn&#8217;t help much, since he says:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Throughout the following discussion I will assume that the reader has studied Conant &amp; Ashby’s original paper, possesses the level of technical competence required to understand their proof, and is familiar with the components of the basic model that they used to prove their theorem [&#8230;.]
</p></blockquote>
<p>However, I have a guess about the essential core of Conant and Ashby&#8217;s theorem.  So, I&#8217;ll state that, and then say more about their setup.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I looked around to see if someone else had already done the work of figuring out what Conant and Ashby were saying.  The best thing I found was this:</p>
<p>&bull; B. A. Francis and W. M. Wonham, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Walter_Wonham/publication/223996193_The_internal_model_principle_of_control_theory/links/5488b5610cf289302e30b828.pdf">The internal model principle of control theory</a>, <em>Automatica</em> <strong>12</strong> (1976) 457&ndash;465.</p>
<p>This paper works in a more specialized context: linear control theory.  They&#8217;ve got a linear system or &#8216;plant&#8217; responding to some input, a regulator or &#8216;compensator&#8217; that is trying to make the plant behave in a desired way, and a &#8216;disturbance&#8217; that affects the plant in some unwanted way.  They prove that to perfectly correct for the disturbance, the compensator must contain an &#8216;internal model&#8217; of the disturbance.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m probably stating this a bit incorrectly.   This paper is much more technical, but it seems to be more careful in stating assumptions and conclusions.  In particular, they seem to give a precise definition of an &#8216;internal model&#8217;.  And I read elsewhere that the &#8216;internal model principle&#8217; proved here has become a classic result in control theory!</p>
<p>This paper says that Conant and Ashby&#8217;s paper provided &#8220;plausibility arguments in favor of the internal model idea&#8221;.  So, perhaps Conant and Ashby inspired Francis and Wonham, and were then largely forgotten.</p>
<h3>My guess </h3>
<p>My guess is that Conant and Ashby&#8217;s theorem boils down to this:</p>
<p><b>Theorem.</b>  Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="R" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S" class="latex" /> be finite sets, and fix a probability distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p" class="latex" /> on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S" class="latex" />.  Suppose <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="q" class="latex" /> is any probability distribution on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R+%5Ctimes+S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="R &#92;times S" class="latex" /> such that</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+p%28s%29+%3D+%5Csum_%7Br+%5Cin+R%7D+q%28r%2Cs%29++%5C%3B+%5Ctextrm%7Bfor+all%7D+%5C%3B+s+%5Cin+S%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ p(s) = &#92;sum_{r &#92;in R} q(r,s)  &#92;; &#92;textrm{for all} &#92;; s &#92;in S} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H%28p%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="H(p)" class="latex" /> be the Shannon entropy of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p" class="latex" /> and let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H%28q%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="H(q)" class="latex" /> be the Shannon entropy of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="q." class="latex" />  Then</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H%28q%29+%5Cge+H%28p%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="H(q) &#92;ge H(p) " class="latex" /></p>
<p>and equality is achieved if there is a function</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h%3A+S+%5Cto+R+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="h: S &#92;to R " class="latex" /></p>
<p>such that</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q%28r%2Cs%29+%3D+%5Cleft%5C%7B%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Bcc%7D+p%28s%29++%26++%5Ctextrm%7Bif%7D+%5C%3B+r+%3D+h%28s%29+%5C%5C+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++0++%26+%5Ctextrm%7Botherwise%7D++%5Cend%7Barray%7D+%5Cright.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="q(r,s) = &#92;left&#92;{&#92;begin{array}{cc} p(s)  &amp;  &#92;textrm{if} &#92;; r = h(s) &#92;&#92;                                             0  &amp; &#92;textrm{otherwise}  &#92;end{array} &#92;right." class="latex" /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &#9608;</p>
<p>Note that this is not an &#8216;if and only if&#8217;.</p>
<p>The proof of this is pretty easy to anyone who knows a bit about probability theory and entropy.  I can restate it using a bit of standard jargon, which may make it more obvious to experts.   We&#8217;ve got an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S" class="latex" />-valued random variable, say <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextbf%7Bs%7D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textbf{s}." class="latex" />   We want to extend it to an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R+%5Ctimes+S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="R &#92;times S" class="latex" />-valued random variable <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5Ctextbf%7Br%7D%2C+%5Ctextbf%7Bs%7D%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(&#92;textbf{r}, &#92;textbf{s})" class="latex" /> whose entropy is small as possible.  Then we can achieve this by choosing a function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h%3A+S+%5Cto+R%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="h: S &#92;to R," class="latex" /> and letting <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextbf%7Bs%7D+%3D+h%28%5Ctextbf%7Br%7D%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textbf{s} = h(&#92;textbf{r})." class="latex" /></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the point: if we make <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextbf%7Bs%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textbf{s}" class="latex" /> be a function of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextbf%7Br%7D%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textbf{r}," class="latex" /> we aren&#8217;t adding any extra randomness, so the entropy doesn&#8217;t go up.</p>
<p>What in the world does this have to do with a good regulator containing a model of the system it&#8217;s regulating?</p>
<p>Well, I can&#8217;t explain that as well as I&#8217;d like&#8212;sorry.  But the rough idea seems to be this.  Suppose that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S" class="latex" /> is a <strong>system</strong> with a given random behavior, and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="R" class="latex" /> is another system, the <strong>regulator</strong>.  If we want the combination of the system and regulator to behave as &#8216;nonrandomly&#8217; as possible, we can let the state of the regulator be a function of the state of the system.</p>
<p>This theorem is actually a &#8216;lemma&#8217; in Conant and Ashby&#8217;s paper.  Let&#8217;s look at their setup, and the &#8216;good regulator theorem&#8217; as they actually state it.</p>
<h3> Their setup</h3>
<p>Conant and Ashby consider five sets and three functions.  In a picture:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Books/Conant_Ashby.pdf"><br />
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/good_regulator_theorem_conant_ashby.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>The sets are these:</p>
<p>&bull; A set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Z" class="latex" /> of possible <strong>outcomes</strong>.</p>
<p>&bull; A <strong>goal</strong>: some subset <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G+%5Csubseteq+Z&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="G &#92;subseteq Z" class="latex" /> of <strong>good</strong> outcomes</p>
<p>&bull; A set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="D" class="latex" /> of <strong>disturbances</strong>, which I might prefer to call &#8216;inputs&#8217;.</p>
<p>&bull; A set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S" class="latex" /> of states of some <strong>system</strong> that is affected by the disturbances.</p>
<p>&bull; A set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="R" class="latex" /> of states of some <strong>regulator</strong> that is also affected by the disturbances.</p>
<p>The functions are these:</p>
<p>&bull; A function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi+%3A+D+%5Cto+S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;phi : D &#92;to S" class="latex" /> saying how a disturbance determines a state of the system.</p>
<p>&bull; A function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho%3A+D+%5Cto+R&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;rho: D &#92;to R" class="latex" /> saying how a disturbance determines a state of the regulator.</p>
<p>&bull; A function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpsi%3A+S+%5Ctimes+R+%5Cto+Z&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;psi: S &#92;times R &#92;to Z" class="latex" /> saying how a state of the system and a state of the regulator determines an outcome.</p>
<p>Of course we want some conditions on these maps.  What we want, <em>I guess</em>, is for the outcome to be good regardless of the disturbance.  I might say that as follows: for every <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d+%5Cin+D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="d &#92;in D" class="latex" /> we have</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpsi%28%5Cphi%28d%29%2C+%5Crho%28d%29%29+%5Cin+G+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;psi(&#92;phi(d), &#92;rho(d)) &#92;in G " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Unfortunately Conant and Ashby say they want this:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho+%5Csubset++%5B%5Cpsi%5E%7B-1%7D%28G%29%5D%5Cphi+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;rho &#92;subset  [&#92;psi^{-1}(G)]&#92;phi " class="latex" /></p>
<p>I can&#8217;t parse this: they&#8217;re using math notation in ways I don&#8217;t recognize.  Can you figure out what they mean, and whether it matches my guess above?</p>
<p>Then, after a lot of examples and stuff, they state their theorem:</p>
<p><b>Theorem.</b> The simplest optimal regulator <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="R" class="latex" /> of a reguland <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S" class="latex" /> produces events <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="R" class="latex" /> which are related to events <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S" class="latex" /> by a mapping <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h%3A+S+%5Cto+R.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="h: S &#92;to R." class="latex" /></p>
<p>Clearly I&#8217;ve skipped over too much!  This barely makes any sense at all.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, looking at the text before the theorem, I don&#8217;t see these terms being explained.  Furthermore, their &#8216;proof&#8217; introduces extra assumptions that were not mentioned in the statement of the theorem.  It begins:</p>

<p>Get it?  Now they&#8217;re saying the state of the regulator <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="R" class="latex" /> depends on the state of the system <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S" class="latex" /> via a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability_distribution">conditional probability distribution</a> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%28r%7Cs%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p(r|s)" class="latex" /> where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r+%5Cin+R&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r &#92;in R" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s+%5Cin+S.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="s &#92;in S." class="latex" />   It&#8217;s odd that they didn&#8217;t mention this earlier!   Their picture made it look like the state of the regulator is determined by the &#8216;disturbance&#8217; via the function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho%3A+D+%5Cto+R.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;rho: D &#92;to R." class="latex" />  But okay.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re also assuming there&#8217;s a probability distribution on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S." class="latex" />  They use this and the above conditional probability distribution to get a probability distribution on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="R." class="latex" /></p>
<p>In fact, the set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="D" class="latex" /> and the functions out of this set seem to play no role in their proof!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear to me exactly what we&#8217;re given, what we get to choose, and what we&#8217;re trying to optimize.  They do try to explain this.  Here&#8217;s what they say:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Now <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%28S%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p(S)" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%28R%7CS%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p(R|S)" class="latex" /> jointly determine <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%28R%2CS%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p(R,S)" class="latex" /> and hence <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%28Z%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p(Z)" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H%28Z%29%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="H(Z)," class="latex" /> the entropy in the set of outcomes:</p>
<p>  <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+H%28Z%29+%3D+-+%5Csum_%7Bz+%5Cin+Z%7D+p%28z%29+%5Clog+%28p%28z%29%29+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ H(Z) = - &#92;sum_{z &#92;in Z} p(z) &#92;log (p(z)) } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>  With <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%28S%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p(S)" class="latex" /> fixed, the class of optimal regulators therefore corresponds to the class of optimal distributions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%28R%7CS%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p(R|S)" class="latex" /> for which <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H%28Z%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="H(Z)" class="latex" /> is minimal. We will call this class of optimal distributions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;pi." class="latex" />
</p></blockquote>
<p>I could write a little essay on why this makes me unhappy, but never mind.  I&#8217;m used to the habit of using the same letter <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p" class="latex" /> to stand for probability distributions on lots of different sets: folks let the argument of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p" class="latex" /> say which set they have in mind at any moment.  So, they&#8217;re starting with a probability distribution on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S" class="latex" /> and a conditional probability distribution on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r+%5Cin+R&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r &#92;in R" class="latex" /> given <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s+%5Cin+S.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="s &#92;in S." class="latex" />  They&#8217;re using these to determine probability distribution on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R+%5Ctimes+S.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="R &#92;times S." class="latex" />  Then, presumably using the map <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpsi%3A+S+%5Ctimes+R+%5Cto+Z%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;psi: S &#92;times R &#92;to Z," class="latex" /> they get a probability distribution on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Z." class="latex" />  <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H%28Z%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="H(Z)" class="latex" /> is the entropy of the probability distribution on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Z," class="latex" /> and for some reason they are trying to minimize this.</p>
<p>(Where did the subset <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G+%5Csubseteq+Z&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="G &#92;subseteq Z" class="latex" /> of &#8216;good&#8217; outcomes go?  Shouldn&#8217;t that play a role?  Oh well.)</p>
<p>I believe the claim is that when this entropy is minimized, there&#8217;s a function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h+%3A+S+%5Cto+R&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="h : S &#92;to R" class="latex" /> such that</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%28r%7Cs%29+%3D+1+%5C%3B+%5Ctextrm%7Bif%7D+%5C%3B+r+%3D+h%28s%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p(r|s) = 1 &#92;; &#92;textrm{if} &#92;; r = h(s)" class="latex" /></p>
<p>This says that the state of the regulator should be completely determined by the the state of the system.    And this, I believe, is what they mean by</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Every good regulator of a system must be a model of that system.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I hope you understand: I&#8217;m not worrying about whether the setup is a good one, e.g. sufficiently general for real-world applications.   I&#8217;m just trying to figure out what the setup actually <em>is</em>, what Conant and Ashby&#8217;s theorem actually <em>says</em>, and whether it&#8217;s <em>true</em>.</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;ve just made a lot of progress.  Surely this was no fun to read.  But it I found it useful to write it.</p>
