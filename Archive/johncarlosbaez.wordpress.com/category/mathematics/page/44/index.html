					<p>Building on the Elsevier boycott, a lot of people are working on <i>positive</i> steps to make expensive journals obsolete.  My email is flooded with discussions, different groups making different plans.  </p>
<p>Email is great, but not for everything.  So <a href="http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/">Andrew Stacey</a> (the technical mastermind behind the <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/HomePage">nLab</a>, <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/HomePage">Azimuth Wiki</a> and <a href="http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Mathforge/Azimuth/">Azimuth Forum</a>):</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/files/AndrewStacey.png" /></div>
<p>and <a href="http://tqft.net/">Scott Morrison</a> (one of the brains behind <a href="http://mathoverflow.net/">MathOverflow</a>, an important math question-and-answer website):</p>
<div align="center"><img width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/tqft.net/web/img/kyoto.jpg" /></div>
<p>have started a forum to talk about the many issues involved:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Mathforge/Math2.0">Math 2.0</a>.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s good, because these guys actually do stuff, not just talk!  Andrew describes the idea here:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The purpose of <a href="http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Mathforge/Math2.0">Math 2.0</a> is to provide a forum for discussion of the future of mathematical publishing.  It&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve viewed as an important issue for years, and have had many, many interesting conversations about, but somehow nothing much seems to happen.  I&#8217;m hoping that the momentum from <a href="http://gowers.wordpress.com/2012/02/02/abstract-thoughts-about-online-review-systems/">Tim Gowers&#8217; recent blog posts</a> might lead to something and I&#8217;d like to capitalise on that.</p>
<p>However, most of the discussion currently is happening in the comments on blog posts.  This is hard to follow, and hard to separate out the new suggestions from the discussions on old ones.  I think that forums are much better for discussion, hence this one.</p>
<p>The name, <b><a href="http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Mathforge/Math2.0">Math2.0</a></b>, is intended to signify two things: that it&#8217;s time for an upgrade of the mathematical environment and that I think we can learn a lot from looking at how software&#8212;particularly open source software&#8212;works.  By &#8220;mathematical environment&#8221;, I don&#8217;t mean how we actually do the mathematics but what happens next, particularly communicating the ideas that we create.  This is where the internet can really change things for the better (as it has started to do with the arXiv), but where I think that we have yet to figure out how to make best use of it.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t just include journals, but I think that that&#8217;s an obvious place to start.</p>
<p>So: welcome to <a href="http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Mathforge/Math2.0">Math2.0</a>.  Please join in.  It&#8217;s important.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Andrew Stacey has also emphasized a principle that&#8217;s good for reducing chat about starry-eyed visions and focusing on what we can do now:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In all these discussions, there is one point that I would like to make at the start and which I think is relevant to any proposal to set up something new for mathematicians (or more generally, for academics).  That is that whatever system is set up it must be:</p>
<div align="center"><b>Useful at the point of use</b></div>
<p>This is something that I&#8217;ve learnt from administering the nLab over the past few years.  It keeps going and there is no sign of it slowing down.  The secret of its success, I maintain, is that it is useful at the point of use.  When I write something on the nLab, I benefit immediately.  I can link to previous things I&#8217;ve written, to definitions that others have written, and so link my ideas to many others.   It means that if I want to talk to someone about something, the thing we are talking about is easily visible and accessible to both (or all) of us.  If I want to remember what it was I was thinking about a year ago, I can easily find it.  The fact that when I come back the next day, whatever I&#8217;ve added has been improved, polished, and added to, is a bonus&#8212;but it would still be useful if that didn&#8217;t happen.</p>
<p>For other things, then I need more of an incentive to participate.  MathOverflow was a lot of fun in the beginning, but now I find that a question needs to be such that it&#8217;s fairly clear that I&#8217;m one of the few people in the world who can answer.  It&#8217;s not that my enthusiasm for the site has gone down, just that everything else keeps pushing it out of the way.  So a new system has to be useful to those who use it, and ideally the usefulness should be proportional to the amount of effort that one puts in.</p>
<p>A corollary of this is that it should be useful even if only a small number of people use it.  The number of core users of the nLab is not large, but nevertheless the nLab is still extremely useful to us.  I can imagine that when a proposal for something new is made, there will be a variety of reactions ranging from &#8220;That&#8217;ll never work&#8221; through to &#8220;Sounds interesting, but &#8230;&#8221; with only a few saying &#8220;Count me in!&#8221;.  To have a chance of succeeding, it has to be the case that those few can get it off the ground and demonstrate that it works, without the input of the wider sceptical community.
</p></blockquote>
<p>So: if you&#8217;re a mathematician or programmer interested in revolutionizing the future of math publishing, go to <a href="http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Mathforge/Math2.0/">Math 2.0</a>, register, and join the conversation!  You&#8217;ll see there are a number of concrete proposals on the table, including one by <a href="http://faculty.chemistry.ucla.edu/institution/personnel?personnel_id=45756">Chris Lee</a>, and <a href="http://people.mbi.ucla.edu/marcharper/">Marc Harper</a> and myself.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll say more about those later.  But I want to add a principle of my own to Andrew&#8217;s &#8216;useful at the point of use&#8217;.  The goal is not to get a universal <i>consensus</i> on the future of math publishing!  Instead, we need a healthy <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dissensus"><b><i>dissensus</i></b></a> in which different groups of people develop different systems&#8212;so we can see which ones work.</p>
<p>In biology, evolution happens when some change is useful at the point of use&#8212;and it doesn&#8217;t happen by consensus, either.  When some fish gradually became amphibians, they didn&#8217;t wait for all fish to agree this was a good move.  And indeed it&#8217;s <i>good</i> that we still have fish.  </p>
<p>Jan Velterop has some interesting thoughts on the evolution of scholarly publishing, which you can read here:</p>
<p>&bull; Richard Poynder, <a href="http://www.richardpoynder.co.uk/Velterop_Interview.pdf">The open access interviews: Jan Velterop</a>, February 2012.</p>
<p>Velterop writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
As a geologist I go so far as to say that I see analogies with the Permian-Triassic boundary and the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary, when life on Earth changed dramatically due to fundamental and sudden changes in the environment.</p>
<p>Those boundary events, as they are known, resulted in mass extinctions, and that’s an unavoidable evolutionary consequence of sudden dramatic environmental changes.</p>
<p>But they also open up ecological niches for new, or hitherto less successful, forms of life. In this regard, it is interesting to see the recent announcement of <a href="http://f1000research.com/2012/01/30/f1000-research-join-us-and-shape-the-future-of-scholarly-communication-2/">F1000 Research</a>, which intends to address the major issues afflicting scientific publishing.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p><b>The evolution of scientific communication will go on, without any doubt, and although that may not mean the total demise of the traditional models, these models will necessarily change. After all, some dinosaur lineages survived as well. We call them birds. And there are some very attractive ones. They are smaller than the dinosaurs they evolved from, though. Much smaller.</b>

<div align="center"><a><img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/dragon_zoom_-1.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>Dan Christensen, Sam Derbyshire and I are writing a paper on a fun topic I&#8217;ve discussed here before: <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/01/07/the-beauty-of-roots-part-2/">the beauty of roots</a>.  We&#8217;re getting help from <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/beauty.pdf">Greg Egan</a>, but he&#8217;s too busy writing his next novel to commit to being a coauthor!  Anyway, I&#8217;m giving a talk about this stuff today, and I think you&#8217;ll at least enjoy the pretty pictures:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/beauty_easy.pdf">The Beauty of Roots</a>: easy fun version.</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/beauty.pdf">The Beauty of Roots</a>: version for mathematicians.  </p>
<p>The version for mathematicians has some proofs; the easy fun version states a few theorems, but it&#8217;s mainly pictures.  </p>
<p>For mathematicians, I think the coolest part is the close relation between our main object of interest:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/polynomialrootssmall.png"><img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/polynomialrootssmall.png" /></a></div>
<p>namely the set of all roots of all polynomials whose coefficients are &plusmn;1, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor_set">Cantor set</a>, which you get by taking a closed interval and repeatedly chopping out the middle third of each piece, forever:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Cantor_set_in_seven_iterations.svg/450px-Cantor_set_in_seven_iterations.svg.png" /></div>
<p>They&#8217;re related because a point in the Cantor set can be seen as an infinite string of 0&#8217;s and 1&#8217;s, while a power series with coefficients &plusmn;1 can be seen as an infinite string of 1&#8217;s and -1&#8217;s.  The sets called &#8216;dragons&#8217;, like the one at the top of this post, are also images of the Cantor set under continuous maps to the complex plane.  But to understand how these facts understand our set of roots of polynomials with coefficients &plusmn;1, read the <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/beauty.pdf">mathematician&#8217;s version</a>  of the talk.</p>

				<small>8 February, 2012</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>As of this moment, 4760 scholars have joined <a href="http://thecostofknowledge.com/">a boycott of the publishing company Elsevier</a>.  Of these, only 20% are mathematicians.  But since the boycott was started by a mathematician, 34 of us wrote and signed an official statement explaining the boycott:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://gowers.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/elsevierstatementfinal.pdf">The Cost of Knowledge</a>.  </p>
<p>It&#8217;s also below.  Please check it out and join the boycott!  I&#8217;m sure more than 34 mathematicians would be happy to sign, but we wanted to get the statement out soon.  </p>
<h3> THE COST OF KNOWLEDGE </h3>
<p>This is an attempt to describe some of the background to the current boycott of Elsevier by many mathematicians (and other academics) at <a href="http://thecostofknowledge.com">http://thecostofknowledge.com</a>, and to present some of the issues that confront the boycott movement.  Although the movement is anything but monolithic, we believe that the points we make here will resonate with many of the signatories to the boycott.</p>
<h4> The role of journals (1): dissemination of research.</h4>
<p>  The role of journals in professional mathematics has been under discussion for some time now.</p>
<p>Traditionally, while journals served several purposes, their primary purpose was the dissemination of research papers.  The journal publishers were charging for the cost of typesetting (not a trivial matter in general before the advent of electronic typesetting, and particularly non-trivial for mathematics), the cost of physically publishing copies of the journals, and the cost of distributing the journals to subscribers (primarily academic libraries).</p>
<p>The editorial board of a journal is a group of professional<br />
mathematicians. Their editorial work is undertaken as part of their scholarly duties, and so is paid for by their employer, typically a university. Thus, from the publisher&#8217;s viewpoint the editors are volunteers. (The editor in chief of a journal sometimes receives modest compensation from the publisher.) When a paper is submitted to the journal, by an author who is again typically a university-employed mathematician, the editors select the referee or referees for the paper, evaluate the referees&#8217; reports, decide whether or not to accept the submission, and organize the submitted papers into volumes.  These are passed on to the publisher, who then undertakes the job of actually publishing them. The publisher supplies some administrative assistance in handling the papers, as well as some copy-editing assistance, which is often quite minor but sometimes more substantial. The referees are again volunteers from the point of view of the publisher: as with editing, refereeing is regarded as part of the service component of a mathematician&#8217;s academic work. Authors are not paid by the publishers for their published papers, although they are usually asked to sign over the copyright to the publisher.</p>
<p>This system made sense when the publishing and dissemination of papers was a difficult and expensive undertaking.  Publishers supplied a valuable service in this regard, for which they were paid by subscribers to the journals, which were mainly academic libraries. The academic institutions whose libraries subscribe to mathematics journals are broadly speaking the same institutions that employ the mathematicians who are writing for, refereeing for, and editing the journals. Therefore, the cost of the whole process of producing research papers is borne by these institutions (and the outside entities that partially fund them, such as the National Science Foundation in the United States): they pay for their academic mathematician employees to do research and to organize the publications of the results of their research in journals; and then (through their libraries) they pay the publishers to disseminate these results among all the world&#8217;s mathematicians. Since these institutions employ research faculty in order to foster research, it certainly used to make sense for them to pay for the dissemination of this research as well. After all, the sharing of scientific ideas and research results is unquestionably a key component for making progress in science.</p>
<p>Now, however, the world has changed in significant ways.<br />
Authors typeset their own papers, using electronic typesetting. Publishing and distribution costs are not<br />
as great as they once were.  And most importantly,<br />
dissemination of scientific ideas no longer takes place via the physical distribution of journal volumes. Rather, it takes place mainly electronically. While this means of dissemination is not free, it is much less expensive, and much of it happens quite independently of mathematical journals.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the cost of journal publishing has gone down<br />
because the cost of typesetting has been shifted from<br />
publishers to authors and the cost of publishing and distribution is significantly lower than it used to be.<br />
By contrast, the amount of money being spent by university libraries on journals seems to be growing with no end in sight.  Why do mathematicians contribute all this volunteer labor, and their employers pay all this money, for a service whose value no longer justifies its cost?</p>
<h4> The role of journals (2): peer review and professional<br />
evaluation</h4>
<p>There are some important reasons that mathematicians haven&#8217;t just abandoned journal publishing. In particular, peer review plays an essential role in ensuring the correctness and readability of mathematical papers, and publishing papers in research journals is the main way of achieving professional recognition. Furthermore, not all journals count equally from this point of view: journals are (loosely) ranked, so that publications in top journals will often count more than publications in lower ranked ones. Professional mathematicians typically have a good sense of the relative prestige of the journals that publish papers in their area, and they will usually submit a paper to the highest ranked journal that they judge is likely to accept and publish it.</p>
<p>Because of this evaluative aspect of traditional journal publishing, the problem of switching to a different model<br />
is much more difficult than it might appear at first.  For<br />
example, it is not easy just to begin a new journal (even an electronic one, which avoids the difficulties of printing and distribution), since mathematicians may not want to publish in it, preferring to submit to journals with known reputations. Secondly, although the reputation of various journals has been created through the efforts of the authors, referees, and editors who have worked (at no cost to the publishers) on it over the years, in many cases the <i>name</i> of the journal is owned by the publisher, making it difficult for the mathematical community to separate this valuable object that they have constructed from its present publisher.</p>
<h4> The role of Elsevier</h4>
<p>Elsevier, Springer, and a number of other commercial publishers (many of them large companies but less significant for their mathematics publishing, e.g., Wiley) all exploit our volunteer labor to extract very large profits from the academic community. They supply some value in the process, but nothing like enough to justify their prices.</p>
<p>Among these publishers, Elsevier may not be the most expensive, but in the light of other factors, such as scandals, lawsuits, lobbying, etc. (discussed further below), we consider them a good initial focus for our discontent. A boycott should be substantial enough to be meaningful, but not so broad that the choice of targets becomes controversial or the boycott becomes an unmanageable burden.  Refusing to submit papers to all overpriced publishers is a reasonable further step, which some of us have taken, but the focus of this boycott is on Elsevier because of the widespread feeling among mathematicians that they are the worst offender.</p>
<p>Let us begin with the issue of journal costs. Unfortunately, it is difficult to make cost comparisons: journals differ greatly in quality, in number of pages per volume, and even in amount of text per page.  As measured by list prices, Elsevier mathematics journals are amongst the most expensive. For instance, in the <a href="http://www.ams.org/membership/mem-journal-survey">AMS mathematics journal price survey</a>, seven of the ten most expensive journals (by 2007 volume list price) were published by Elsevier.   (All prices are as of 2007 because both prices and page counts are easily available online.)  However, that is primarily because Elsevier publishes the largest volumes. Price per page is a more meaningful measure that can be easily computed.  By this standard, Elsevier is certainly not the worst publisher, but its prices do on the face of it look very high. The <i>Annals of Mathematics</i>, published by Princeton University Press, is one of the absolute top mathematics journals and quite affordably priced: &#036;0.13/page as of 2007.  By contrast, ten Elsevier journals (not including one that has since ceased publication) cost &#036;1.30/page or more; they and three others cost more per page than <i>any</i> journal published by a university press or learned society. For comparison, three other top journals competing with the <i>Annals</i> are <i>Acta Mathematica</i>, published by the Institut Mittag Leffler for &#036;0.65/page, <i>Journal of the American Mathematical Society</i>, published by the American Mathematical Society for &#036;0.24/page, and <i>Inventiones Mathematicae</i>, published by Springer for &#036;1.21/page.  Note that none of Elsevier&#8217;s mathematics journals is generally considered comparable in quality to these journals.</p>
<p>However, there is an additional aspect which makes it hard to compute the true cost of mathematics journals. This is the widespread practice among large commercial publishers of &#8220;bundling&#8221; journals, which allows libraries to subscribe to large numbers of journals in order to avoid paying the exorbitant list prices for the ones they need. Although this means that the average price libraries pay per journal is less than the list prices might suggest, what really matters is the average price that they pay per journal (or page of journal) <i>that they actually want</i>, which is hard to assess, but clearly higher. We would very much like to be able to offer more concrete data regarding the actual costs to libraries of Elsevier journals compared with those of Springer or other publishers. Unfortunately, this is difficult, because publishers often make it a contractual requirement that their institutional customers should not disclose the financial details of their contracts. For example, Elsevier sued Washington State University to try to prevent release of this information. One common consequence of these arrangements, though, is that in many cases a library cannot actually save any money by cancelling a few Elsevier journals: at best the money can sometimes be diverted to pay for other Elsevier subscriptions.</p>
<p>One reason for focusing on Elsevier rather than, say, Springer is that Springer has had a rich and productive history with the mathematical community. As well as journals, it has published important series of textbooks, monographs, and lecture notes; one could perhaps regard the prices of its journals as a means of subsidizing these other, less profitable, types of publications. Although all these types of publications have become less important with the advent of the internet and the resulting electronic distribution of texts, the long and continuing presence of Springer in the mathematical world has resulted in a store of goodwill being built up in the mathematical community towards them.  This store is being rapidly depleted, but has not yet reached zero.  See for instance the <a href="http://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/petitions/index.php?petition=3">recent petition to Springer</a> by a number of French mathematicians and departments.</p>
<p>Elsevier does not have a comparable tradition of involvement in mathematics publishing.  Many of the mathematics journals that it publishes have been acquired comparatively recently as it has bought up other, smaller publishers.   Furthermore, in recent years it has been involved in various scandals regarding the scientific content, or lack thereof, of its journals. One in particular involved the journal <i>Chaos, Solitons &amp; Fractals</i>,  which, at the time the scandal broke in 2008&#8211;2009, was one of the highest impact factor  mathematics journals that Elsevier published.   (Elsevier currently reports the five-year impact factor of this journal at 1.729.  For sake of comparison, <i>Advances in Mathematics</i>, also published by Elsevier, is reported as having a five-year impact factor of 1.575.)  It turned out that the high impact factor was at least partly the result of the journal publishing many papers full of mutual citations.  (See  <a href="http://www.siam.org/news/news.php?id=1663">Arnold</a> for more information on this and other troubling examples that show the limitations of bibliometric measures of scholarly quality.) Furthermore, <i>Chaos, Solitons &amp; Fractals</i> published many papers that, in our professional judgement, have little or no scientific merit and should not have been published in any reputable journal.</p>
<p>In another notorious episode, this time in medicine, for at least five years Elsevier &#8220;published a series of sponsored article compilation publications, on behalf of pharmaceutical clients, that were made to look like journals and lacked the proper disclosures&#8221;, as noted by <a href="http://www.elsevier.
com/wps/find/authored_newsitem.cws_home/companynews05_01203">the CEO of Elsevier&#8217;s Health Sciences Division</a>.</p>
<p>Recently, Elsevier has lobbied for the Research Works Act, a proposed U.S. law that would undo the National Institutes of Health&#8217;s public access policy, which guarantees public access to published research papers based on NIH funding within twelve months of publication (to give publishers time to make a profit). Although most lobbying occurs behind closed doors, Elsevier&#8217;s vocal support of this act shows their opposition to a popular and effective open access policy.</p>
<p>These scandals, taken together with the bundling practices, exorbitant prices, and lobbying activities, suggest a publisher motivated purely by profit, with no genuine interest in or commitment to mathematical knowledge and the community of academic mathematicians that generates it.  Of course, many Elsevier employees are reasonable people doing their best to contribute to scholarly publishing, and we bear them no ill will.  However, the organization as a whole does not seem to have the interests of the mathematical community at heart.</p>
<h4> The boycott </h4>
<p>Not surprisingly, many mathematicians have in recent years lost patience with being involved in a system in which commercial publishers make profits based on the free labor of mathematicians and subscription fees from their institutions&#8217; libraries, for a service that has become largely unnecessary.  (See <a href="http://www.scottaaronson.com/writings/journal.pdf">Scott Aaronson&#8217;s scathing but all-too-true satirical description</a> of the publishers&#8217; business model.)  Among all the commercial publishers, the behavior of Elsevier seemed to many to be the most egregious, and a number of mathematicians had made personal commitments to avoid any involvement with Elsevier journals.  (Some journals were also successfully moved from Elsevier to other publishers; e.g., <i>Annales Scientifiques de l&#8217;&eacute;cole Normale Sup&eacute;rieure</i> which until recent years was published by Elsevier, is now published by the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Math&eacute;matique de France.)</p>
<p>One of us (Timothy Gowers) decided that it might be useful to<br />
publicize his own personal boycott of Elsevier, thus encouraging others to do the same.   This led to the current boycott movement at <a href="http://thecostofknowledge.com">http://thecostofknowledge.com</a>, the success of which has far exceeded his initial expectations.</p>
<p>Each participant in the boycott can choose which activities they intend to avoid: submitting to Elsevier journals, refereeing for them, and serving on editorial boards.  Of course, submitting papers and editing journals are purely voluntary activities, but refereeing is a more subtle issue.  The entire peer review system depends on the availability of suitable referees, and its success is one of the great traditions of science: refereeing is felt to be both a burden and an honor, and practically every member of the community willingly takes part in it. However, while we respect and value this tradition, many of us do not wish to see our labor used to support Elsevier&#8217;s business model.</p>
<h4> What next?</h4>
<p>As suggested at the very beginning, different participants in the boycott have different goals, both in the short and long term.  Some people would like to see the journal system eliminated completely and replaced by something else more adapted to the internet and the possibilities of electronic distribution.  Others see journals as continuing to play a role, but with commercial publishing being replaced by open access models. Still others imagine a more modest change, in which commercial publishers are replaced by non-profit entities such as professional societies (e.g., the American Mathematical Society, the London Mathematical Society, and the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Math&eacute;matique de France, all of which already publish a number of journals) or university presses; in this way the value generated by the work of authors, referees, and editors would be returned to the academic and scientific community. These goals need not be mutually exclusive: the world of mathematics journals, like the world of mathematics itself, is large, and open access journals can coexist with traditional journals, as well as with other, more novel means of dissemination and evaluation.</p>
<p>What all the signatories do agree on is that Elsevier is an exemplar of everything that is wrong with the current system of commercial publication of mathematics journals, and we will no longer acquiesce to Elsevier&#8217;s harvesting of the value of our and our colleagues&#8217; work.</p>
<p>What future do we envisage for all the papers that would<br />
otherwise be published in Elsevier journals? There are many<br />
other journals being published; perhaps they can pick up at<br />
least some of the slack. Many successful new journals have been founded in recent years, too, including several that are electronic (thus completely eliminating printing and physical distribution costs), and no doubt more will follow. Finally, we hope that the mathematical community will be able to reclaim for itself some of the value that it has given to Elsevier&#8217;s journals by moving some of these journals (in name, if possible, and otherwise in spirit)  from Elsevier to other publishers.  One notable example  is the August 10, 2006 resignation of the entire editorial board of the Elsevier journal <i>Topology</i> and their founding of the <i>Journal of Topology</i>, owned by the London Mathematical Society.  </p>
<p>None of these changes will be easy; editing a journal is hard work, and founding a new journal, or moving and relaunching an existing journal, is even harder. But the alternative is to continue with the status quo, in which Elsevier harvests ever larger profits from the work of us and our colleagues, and this is both unsustainable and unacceptable.</p>

<h4> Appendix: recommendations for mathematicians.</h4>
<p>All mathematicians must decide for themselves whether, or to what extent, they wish to participate in the boycott.  Senior<br />
mathematicians who have signed the boycott bear some<br />
responsibility towards junior colleagues who are forgoing the<br />
option of publishing in Elsevier journals, and should do their<br />
best to help minimize any negative career consequences.</p>
<p>Whether or not you decide to join the boycott, there are some<br />
simple actions that everyone can take, which seem to us to be<br />
uncontroversial:</p>
<p>1)  Make sure that the final versions of all your papers, particularly new ones, are freely available online&#8212;  ideally both on the arXiv.  (Elsevier&#8217; electronic preprint policy is    unacceptable, because it explicitly does not allow authors to update their papers on the arXiv to incorporate changes made during peer review). When signing copyright transfer forms, we recommend amending them (if necessary) to reserve the right to make the author&#8217;s final version of the text available free online from servers such as the arXiv, and on your home page.</p>
<p>2) If you are submitting a paper and there is a choice between an expensive journal and a cheap (or free) journal of the same standard, then always submit to the cheap one.</p>

					<p>Ever since I was a kid, I&#8217;ve loved <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_by_regular_polygons#Archimedean.2C_uniform_or_semiregular_tilings"><b>Archimedean tilings</b></a> of the plane: that is, tilings by regular polygons where all the edge lengths are the same and every vertex looks alike.  Here&#8217;s my favorite:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_trihexagonal_tiling"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Tiling_Semiregular_4-6-12_Great_Rhombitrihexagonal.svg/400px-Tiling_Semiregular_4-6-12_Great_Rhombitrihexagonal.svg.png" /><br />
</a></div>
<p>There are also 11 others, two of which are mirror images of each other.   But how do we know this?  How do we list them all and be sure we haven&#8217;t left any out?</p>
<p>The interior angle of a regular <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" />-sided polygon is obviously</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B%5Cpi+-+%5Cfrac%7B2+%5Cpi%7D%7Bk%7D%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{&#92;pi - &#92;frac{2 &#92;pi}{k}} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>since it&#8217;s a bit less than 180 degrees, or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;pi," class="latex" /> and how much?&#8212; well, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2Fk&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="1/k" class="latex" /> times a full turn, or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2+%5Cpi.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="2 &#92;pi." class="latex" />  But these <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;pi" class="latex" />&#8216;s are getting annoying: it&#8217;s easier to say &#8216;a full turn&#8217; than write <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5Cpi.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="2&#92;pi." class="latex" />   Then we can say the interior angle is </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D+-+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bk%7D%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{&#92;frac{1}{2} - &#92;frac{1}{k}} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>times a full turn.  </p>
<p>Now suppose we have an Archimedean tiling where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" /> polygons meet: one with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k_1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k_1" class="latex" /> sides, one with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k_2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k_2" class="latex" /> sides, and so on up to one with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k_n" class="latex" /> sides.  Their interior angles must add up to a full turn.  So, we have</p>

<p>or</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B%5Cfrac%7Bn%7D%7B2%7D+-+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bk_1%7D+-+%5Ccdots+-+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bk_n%7D+%3D+1%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{&#92;frac{n}{2} - &#92;frac{1}{k_1} - &#92;cdots - &#92;frac{1}{k_n} = 1} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>or </p>

<p>So: <b>to get an Archimedean tiling you need <i>n</i> whole numbers whose reciprocals add up to one less than <i>n</i>/2.</b>   </p>
<p>Looking for numbers like this is a weird little math puzzle.  The Egyptians liked writing numbers as sums of reciprocals, so they might have enjoyed this game if they&#8217;d known it.  The tiling I showed you comes from this solution:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B4%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B6%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B12%7D++%3D+%5Cfrac%7B3%7D%7B2%7D+-+1+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{&#92;frac{1}{4} + &#92;frac{1}{6} + &#92;frac{1}{12}  = &#92;frac{3}{2} - 1 } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>since it has 3 polygons meeting at each vertex: a 4-sided one, a 6-sided one and a 12-sided one.  </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another solution:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B4%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B4%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B6%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B4%7D%7B2%7D+-+1+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{&#92;frac{1}{3} + &#92;frac{1}{4} + &#92;frac{1}{4} + &#92;frac{1}{6} = &#92;frac{4}{2} - 1 } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>It gives us this tiling:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhombitrihexagonal_tiling"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/Tiling_Semiregular_3-4-6-4_Small_Rhombitrihexagonal.svg/400px-Tiling_Semiregular_3-4-6-4_Small_Rhombitrihexagonal.svg.png" /><br />
</a></div>
<p>Hmm, now I think <i>this</i> one is my favorite, because my eye sees it as a bunch of linked 12-sided polygons, sort of like chain mail.  Different tilings make my eyes move over them in different ways, and this one has a very pleasant effect.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another solution:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B6%7D++%3D+%5Cfrac%7B5%7D%7B2%7D+-+1+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{&#92;frac{1}{3} + &#92;frac{1}{3} + &#92;frac{1}{3} + &#92;frac{1}{3} + &#92;frac{1}{6}  = &#92;frac{5}{2} - 1 } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>This gives two Archimedean tilings that are mirror images of each other!</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snub_hexagonal_tiling"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Tiling_Semiregular_3-3-3-3-6_Snub_Hexagonal.svg/200px-Tiling_Semiregular_3-3-3-3-6_Snub_Hexagonal.svg.png" /></a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snub_hexagonal_tiling"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Tiling_Semiregular_3-3-3-3-6_Snub_Hexagonal_Mirror.svg/200px-Tiling_Semiregular_3-3-3-3-6_Snub_Hexagonal_Mirror.svg.png" /></a></div>
<p>Of course, whether you count these as two different Archimedean tilings or just one depends on what rules you choose.  And by the way, people usually don&#8217;t say a tiling is Archimedean if all the polygons are the same, like this:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_tiling"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Tiling_Regular_6-3_Hexagonal.svg/400px-Tiling_Regular_6-3_Hexagonal.svg.png" /></a></div>
<p>They instead say it&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_by_regular_polygons#Regular_tilings"><b>regular</b></a>.  If modern mathematicians were inventing this subject, we&#8217;d say regular tilings are a special case of Archimedean tilings&#8212;but this math is all very old, and back then mathematicians treated special cases as <i>not included in</i> the general case.  For example, the Greeks didn&#8217;t even consider the number 1 to be a number!  </p>
<p>So here&#8217;s a fun puzzle: <i>classify the Archimedean tilings!</i>  For starters, you need to find all ways to get <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" /> whole numbers whose reciprocals add up to one less than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%2F2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n/2" class="latex" />.  That sounds hard, but luckily it&#8217;s obvious that</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%5Cle+6&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n &#92;le 6" class="latex" /></p>
<p>since an equilateral triangle has the smallest interior angle, of any regular polygon, and you can only fit 6 of them around a vertex.  If you think a bit, you&#8217;ll see this cuts the puzzle down to a finite search.</p>
<p>But you have to be careful, since there are some solutions that don&#8217;t give Archimedean tilings.  As usual, the number 5 causes problems.  We have</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B5%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B5%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B10%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B3%7D%7B2%7D+-+1+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{1}{5} + &#92;frac{1}{5} + &#92;frac{1}{10} = &#92;frac{3}{2} - 1 }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>but there&#8217;s no way to tile the plane so that 2 regular pentagons and 1 regular decagon meet at each vertex!   Kepler seems to have tried; here&#8217;s a picture from his book <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonices_Mundi">Harmonices Mundi</a></i>:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/93/25/14271.long"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/kepler_harmonices_mundi.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>It works beautifully at one vertex, but not for a tiling of the whole plane.  To save the day he had to add some stars, and some of the decagons overlap!  The <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week281.html#tilings">Islamic tiling artists</a>, and later Penrose, went further in this direction.</p>
<p>If you get stuck on this puzzle, you can find the answer here:</p>
<p>&bull; Michal Krížek, Jakub Šolc, and Alena Šolcová, <a href="http://www.ams.org/notices/201201/rtx120100022p.pdf">Is there a crystal lattice possessing five-fold symmetry?</a>, <i>AMS Notices</i> <b>59</b> (January 2012), 22-30. </p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_by_regular_polygons#Combinations_of_regular_polygons_that_can_meet_at_a_vertex">Combinations of regular polygons that can meet at a vertex</a>, Wikipedia.</p>
<h3> Not enough? </h3>
<p>In short, all Archimedean tilings of the plane arise from finding <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" /> whole numbers whose reciprocals sum to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%2F2+-+1.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n/2 - 1." class="latex" /> But what if the total is not enough? Don&#8217;t feel bad: you might still get a tiling of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry">hyperbolic plane</a>.  For example, </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B7%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B7%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B7%7D+%3C+%5Cfrac%7B3%7D%7B2%7D+-+1+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{1}{7} + &#92;frac{1}{7} + &#92;frac{1}{7} &lt; &#92;frac{3}{2} - 1 }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>so you can&#8217;t tile the plane with 3 heptagons meeting at each corner&#8230; but you still get this tiling of the hyperbolic plane:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://www.plunk.org/~hatch/HyperbolicTesselations/"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Uniform_tiling_73-t0.png/400px-Uniform_tiling_73-t0.png" /></a></div>
<p>which happens to be related to a wonderful thing called <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/klein.html">Klein&#8217;s quartic curve</a>.  </p>
<p>You don&#8217;t always win&#8230; but sometimes you do, so the game is worth playing.  For example, </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D++%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B4%7D+%3C+%5Cfrac%7B6%7D%7B2%7D+-+1+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{1}{3} + &#92;frac{1}{3} + &#92;frac{1}{3}  + &#92;frac{1}{3} + &#92;frac{1}{3} + &#92;frac{1}{4} &lt; &#92;frac{6}{2} - 1 }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>so you <i>have a chance</i> at a tiling of the hyperbolic plane where five equilateral triangles and a square meet at each vertex.  And in this case, you luck out:</p>
<div align="center"><a href=""><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Uniform_tiling_433-snub.png/400px-Uniform_tiling_433-snub.png" /></a></div>

<h3> Too much?  </h3>
<p>Similarly, if you&#8217;ve got <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" /> reciprocals that add up to  <i>more</i> than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%2F2+-1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n/2 -1" class="latex" />, you&#8217;ve got a chance at tiling the <i>sphere</i>.  For example, </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D++%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B5%7D+%3E+%5Cfrac%7B5%7D%7B2%7D+-+1+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{1}{3} + &#92;frac{1}{3} + &#92;frac{1}{3}  + &#92;frac{1}{3} + &#92;frac{1}{5} &gt; &#92;frac{5}{2} - 1 }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>and in this case we luck out and get the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snub_dodecahedron">snub dodecahedron</a>.  I thought it was rude to snub a dodecahedron, but apparently not:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snub_dodecahedron"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/Snubdodecahedronccw.gif" /></a></div>
<p>These tilings of the sphere are technically called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedean_solid">Archimedean solids</a> and (if all the polygons are the same) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_solid">Platonic solids</a>. Of these, only the snub dodecahedron and the &#8216;snub cube&#8217; are different from their mirror images. </p>
<h3> Fancier stuff </h3>
<p>In short, adding up reciprocals of whole numbers is related to Archimedean tilings of the plane, the sphere and the hyperbolic plane. But this is also how Egyptians would write fractions!    In fact they even demanded that all the reciprocals be <i>distinct</i>, so instead of writing 2/3 as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;frac{1}{3} + &#92;frac{1}{3}" class="latex" />, they&#8217;d write <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B6%7D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;frac{1}{2} + &#92;frac{1}{6}." class="latex" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a lousy system&#8212;doubtless this is why King Tut died so young.   But forget about the restriction that the reciprocals be distinct: that&#8217;s silly.  If you can show that for every <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%3E+1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n &gt; 1" class="latex" /> the number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=4%2Fn&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="4/n" class="latex" /> can be written as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2Fa+%2B+1%2Fb+%2B+1%2Fc&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="1/a + 1/b + 1/c" class="latex" /> for whole numbers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%2Cb%2Cc%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a,b,c," class="latex" /> you&#8217;ll be famous! So far people have &#8216;only&#8217; shown it&#8217;s true for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" /> up to a hundred trillion: </p>

<p>So, see if you can do better!   But if you&#8217;re into fancy math, a less stressful activity might be to read about Egyptian fractions, tilings and ADE classifications:</p>
<p>&bull; John Baez, <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week182.html">This Week&#8217;s Finds in Mathematical Physics (Week 182)</a>.</p>
<p>This only gets into &#8216;Platonic&#8217; or &#8216;regular&#8217; tilings, not the more general &#8216;Archimedean&#8217; or &#8216;semiregular&#8217; ones I&#8217;m talking about today&#8212;so the arithmetic works a bit differently.</p>
<p>For the special magic arising from </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2F2+%2B+1%2F3+%2B+1%2F7+%2B+1%2F42+%3D+1+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="1/2 + 1/3 + 1/7 + 1/42 = 1 " class="latex" /></p>

					<p><a href="http://www.gregegan.net/SCIENCE/Littlewood/Littlewood.html"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/littlewood1.png" /></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a bit more on <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/12/11/the-beauty-of-roots/">the beauty of roots</a>&#8212;some things that may have escaped those of you who weren&#8217;t following this blog carefully!</p>
<p>Greg Egan has a great new applet for exploring the roots of <b>Littlewood polynomials</b> of a given degree&#8212;meaning polynomials whose coefficients are all &plusmn;1:</p>
<p>&bull; Greg Egan, <a href="http://www.gregegan.net/SCIENCE/Littlewood/Littlewood.html">Littlewood applet</a>.</p>
<p>Move the mouse around to create a little rectangle, and the applet will zoom in to show the roots in that region.  For example, the above region is close to the number  -0.0572 + 0.72229<i>i</i>.</p>
<p>Then, by holding the shift key and clicking the mouse, compare the corresponding &#8216;dragon&#8217;.  We get the <b>dragon</b> for some complex number by evaluating all power series whose coefficients are all &plusmn;1 at this number.  </p>
<p>You&#8217;ll see that often the dragon for some number resembles the set of roots of Littlewood polynomials near that number!  To get a sense of why, read Greg&#8217;s explanation.  However, he uses a different, though equivalent, definition of the dragon (which he calls the &#8216;Julia set&#8217;).</p>
<p>He also made a great video showing how the dragons change shape as you move around the complex plane:</p>
<div class="embed-vimeo" style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/34550155" width="450" height="255" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>The dragon is well-defined for any number inside the unit circle, since all power series with coefficients &plusmn;1 converge inside this circle.  If you watch the video carefully&#8212;it helps to make it big&#8212;you&#8217;ll see a little white cross moving around inside the unit circle, indicating which dragon you&#8217;re seeing.   </p>
<p>I&#8217;m writing a paper about this stuff with Dan Christensen and Sam Derbyshire&#8230; that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m not giving a very careful explanation now.  We invited Greg Egan to join us, but he&#8217;s too busy writing the third volume of his trilogy <a href="http://www.gregegan.net/ORTHOGONAL/ORTHOGONAL.html"><i>Orthogonal</i></a>.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>I feel like talking about some pure math, just for fun on a Sunday afternooon.</p>
<p>Back in 2006, Dan Christensen did something rather simple and got a surprisingly complex and interesting result.  He took a whole bunch of polynomials with integer coefficients and drew their roots as points on the complex plane.  The patterns were astounding!  </p>
<p>Then Sam Derbyshire joined in the game.  After experimenting a bit, he decided that his favorite were polynomials whose coefficients were all 1 or -1.   So, he computed all the roots of all the polynomials of this sort having degree 24.  That&#8217;s 2<sup>24</sup> polynomials, and about 24 &times; 2<sup>24</sup> roots&#8212;or about 400 million roots!  It took Mathematica four days to generate the coordinates of all these roots, producing about 5 gigabytes of data.  </p>
<p>He then plotted all the roots using some Java programs, and created this amazing image: </p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/polynomialrootssmall.png"><img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/polynomialrootssmall.png" /></a></div>
<p>You really need to click on it and see a bigger version, to understand how nice it is.  But Sam also zoomed in on specific locations, shown here:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/polynomialrootscrops.png"><img border="none" width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/polynomialrootscrops.png" /><br />
</a>
</div>
<p>Here&#8217;s a closeup of the hole at 1:  </p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/polynomialroots1.png"><img border="none" width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/polynomialroots1.png" /></a></div>
<p>Note the line along the real axis!  It&#8217;s oddly hard to see on my computer screen right now, but it&#8217;s there and it&#8217;s important.   It exists because lots more of these polynomials have real roots than <i>nearly</i> real roots.</p>
<p>Next, here&#8217;s the hole at <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i" class="latex" />:</p>

</a> </div>
<p>And here&#8217;s the hole at <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e%5E%7Bi+%5Cpi+%2F+4%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="e^{i &#92;pi / 4}" class="latex" />:</p>

</div>
<p>Note how the density of roots increases as we get closer to<br />
this point, but then suddenly drops off right next to it.  Note also the subtle patterns in the density of roots.</p>
<p>But the feathery structures as we move inside the unit circle are even more beautiful!  Here is what they look near the real axis &mdash; this plot is centered at the point <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B4%7D%7B5%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;frac{4}{5}" class="latex" />:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/polynomialroots08.png"><img border="none" width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/polynomialroots08.png" /></a></div>
<p>They have a very different character near the point <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B4%7D%7B5%7Di&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;frac{4}{5}i" class="latex" />:</p>

<p>But I think my favorite is the region near the point <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7De%5E%7Bi%2F5%7D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;frac{1}{2}e^{i/5}." class="latex" />  This image is almost a metaphor of how mathematical patterns emerge from confusion&#8230; like sharply defined figures looming from the mist as you drive by with your headlights on at night:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/polynomialroots05expi02.png"><img border="none" width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/polynomialroots05expi02.png" /></a>
</div>
<p>Now, you may remember that I said all this already in <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week285.html">&#8220;week285&#8221;</a> of <i>This Week&#8217;s Finds</i>.  So why am I talking about it again? </p>
<p>Well, the patterns I&#8217;ve just showed you are tantalizing, and at first quite mysterious&#8230; but &#8216;some guy on the street&#8217; and Greg Egan figured out how to understand some of them during the <a href="http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/12/this_weeks_finds_in_mathematic_46.html">discussion</a> of &#8220;week285&#8221;.  The resulting story is quite beautiful!  But this discussion was a bit hard to follow, since it involved smart people figuring out things as they went along.  So, I doubt many people understood it&#8212;at least compared to the number of people who <i>could</i> understand it.</p>
<p>Let me just explain one pattern here.   Why does this region near <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7De%5E%7Bi%2F5%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;frac{1}{2}e^{i/5}" class="latex" />:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/polynomialroots05expi02.png"><img border="none" width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/polynomialroots05expi02_closeup.png" /></a>
</div>
<p>look so much like the fractal called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve#Heighway_dragon">dragon</a>?</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve#Heighway_dragon"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/DragonCurve_animation.gif/400px-DragonCurve_animation.gif" /></a></div>
<p>You can create a dragon in various ways.  In the animated image above, we&#8217;re starting with a single horizontal straight line segment (which is not shown for some idiotic reason) and repeatedly doing the same thing.  Namely, at each step we&#8217;re replacing every segment by two shorter segments at right angles to each other:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve#Heighway_dragon"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/dragon_construction.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>At each step, we have a continuous curve.  The dragon that appears in the limit of infinitely many steps is also a continuous curve.  But it&#8217;s a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-filling_curve">space-filling curve</a>: it has nonzero area!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another, more relevant way to create a dragon.  Take these two functions from the complex plane to itself:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+f_%2B+%28x%29+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%2Bi%7D%7B2%7D+x+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ f_+ (x) = &#92;frac{1+i}{2} x } " class="latex" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+f_-+%28x%29+%3D+1-+%5Cfrac%7B1-i%7D%7B2%7D+x+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ f_- (x) = 1- &#92;frac{1-i}{2} x } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Pick a point in the plane and keep hitting it with either of these functions: you can randomly make up your mind which to use each time.  No matter what choices you make, you&#8217;ll get a sequence of points that converges&#8230; and it converges to a point in the dragon!  We can get all points in the dragon this way.</p>
<p>But where did these two functions come from?  What&#8217;s so special about them?</p>
<p>To get the specific dragon I just showed you, we need these specific functions.  They have the effect of taking the horizontal line segment from the point 0 to the point 1, and mapping it to the two segments that form the simple picture shown at the far left here:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve#Heighway_dragon"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/dragon_construction.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>As we repeatedly apply them, we get more and more segments, which form the ever more fancy curves in this sequence. </p>
<p>But if all we want is <i>some</i> sort of interesting set of points in the plane, we don&#8217;t need to use these specific functions.  The most important thing is that our functions be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraction_mapping"><b>contractions</b></a>, meaning they reduce distances between points.  Suppose we have two contractions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%2B&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_+" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_-&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_-" class="latex" /> from the plane to itself.  Then there is a unique closed and bounded set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S" class="latex" /> in the plane with</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S+%3D+f_%2B%28S%29+%5Ccup+f_-%28S%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S = f_+(S) &#92;cup f_-(S)" class="latex" /></p>
<p>Moreover, suppose we start with some point <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> in the plane and keep hitting it with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%2B&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_+" class="latex" /> and/or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_-%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_-," class="latex" /> in any way we like.  Then we&#8217;ll get a sequence that converges to a point in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S." class="latex" />  And even better, every point in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S" class="latex" /> show up as a limit of a sequence like this.  We can even get them all starting from the same <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x." class="latex" /></p>
<p>All this follows from a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterated_function_system#Definition">famous theorem</a> due to John Hutchinson.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cute,&#8221; you&#8217;re thinking.  &#8220;But what does this have to do with roots of polynomials whose coefficients are all 1 or -1?&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, we can get polynomials of this type by starting with the number 0 and repeatedly applying these two functions, which depend on a parameter <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="z" class="latex" />:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%2B%28x%29+%3D+1+%2B+z+x+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_+(x) = 1 + z x " class="latex" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_-%28x%29+%3D+1+-+z+x+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_-(x) = 1 - z x " class="latex" /></p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%2B%280%29+%3D+1+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_+(0) = 1 " class="latex" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%2B%28f_%2B%280%29%29+%3D+1+%2B+z+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_+(f_+(0)) = 1 + z " class="latex" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_-%28f_%2B%28f_%2B%280%29%29%29+%3D+1+-+z%281+%2B+z%29+%3D+1+-+z+-+z%5E2+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_-(f_+(f_+(0))) = 1 - z(1 + z) = 1 - z - z^2 " class="latex" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%2B%28f_-%28f_%2B%28f_%2B%280%29%29%29%29+%3D+1+%2B+z%281+-+z+-+z%5E2%29+%3D+1+-+z+-+z%5E2+%2B+z%5E3+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_+(f_-(f_+(f_+(0)))) = 1 + z(1 - z - z^2) = 1 - z - z^2 + z^3 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>and so on.  All these polynomials have constant term 1, never -1.  But apart from that, we can get <i>all</i> polynomials with coefficients 1 or -1 using this trick.  So, we get them all up to an overall sign&#8212;and that&#8217;s good enough for studying their roots.</p>
<p>Now, depending on what <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="z" class="latex" /> is, the functions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%2B&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_+" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_-&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_-" class="latex" /> will give us different generalized dragon sets.  We need <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Cz%7C+%3C+1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="|z| &lt; 1" class="latex" /> for these functions to be contraction mappings.  Given that, we get a generalized dragon set in the way I explained.  Let&#8217;s call it <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_z&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S_z" class="latex" />  to indicate that it depends on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="z" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>Greg Egan drew some of these sets <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_z&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S_z" class="latex" />.  Here&#8217;s one that looks like a dragon:</p>
<div align="center"><img width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/Julia1.gif" /></div>
<p>Here&#8217;s one that looks more like a feather:</p>
<div align="center"><img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/Julia2.gif" /></div>
<p>Now here&#8217;s the devastatingly cool fact: </p>
<p><i><b>Near the point z in the complex plane, the set Sam Derbyshire drew looks a bit like the generalized dragon set S<sub>z</sub>!</b></i></p>
<p>The words &#8216;a bit like&#8217; are weasel words, because I don&#8217;t know the precise theorem.  If you look at Sam&#8217;s picture again:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/polynomialrootssmall.png"><img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/polynomialrootssmall.png" /></a></div>
<p>you&#8217;ll see a lot of &#8216;haze&#8217; near the unit circle, which is where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%2B&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_+" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_-&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_-" class="latex" /> cease to be contraction mappings.  Outside the unit circle&#8212;well, I don&#8217;t want to talk about that now!  But inside the unit circle, you should be able to see that I&#8217;m at least roughly right.  For example, if we zoom in near <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z+%3D+0.372+-+.542+i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="z = 0.372 - .542 i" class="latex" />, we get dragons:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/polynomialroots05expi02.png"><img border="none" width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/polynomialroots05exp-i02_closeup.png" /></a>
</div>
<p>which look at least roughly like this:</p>
<div align="center"><img width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/Julia1.gif" /></div>
<p>In fact they should look <i>very much</i> like this, but I&#8217;m too lazy to find the point <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z+%3D+0.372+-+.542+i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="z = 0.372 - .542 i" class="latex" /> and zoom in very closely to that point in Sam&#8217;s picture, to check!  </p>
<p>Similarly, near the point <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0.8+%2B+0.2+i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="0.8 + 0.2 i" class="latex" />, we get feathers:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/polynomialroots08.png"><img border="none" width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/polynomialroots08+02i.png" /></a></div>
<p>that look a lot like this:</p>
<div align="center"><img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/Julia2.gif" /></div>
<p>Again, it would be more convincing if I could exactly locate the point <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0.8+%2B+0.2+i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="0.8 + 0.2 i" class="latex" /> and zoom in there.  But I think I can persuade Dan Christensen to do that for me.</p>
<p>Now there are lots of questions left to answer, like &#8220;What about all the black regions in the middle of Sam&#8217;s picture?&#8221; and &#8220;what about those funny-looking holes near the unit circle?&#8221;  But the most urgent question is this:</p>
<p><i><b>If you take the set Sam Derbyshire drew and zoom in near  the point z, why should it look like the generalized dragon set S<sub>z</sub>?</b></i></p>
<p>And the answer was discovered by &#8216;some guy on the street&#8217;&#8212;our pseudonymous, nearly anonymous friend.   It&#8217;s related to something called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set#Relationship_with_Julia_sets">Julia&#8211;Mandelbrot correspondence</a>.  I wish I could explain it clearly, but I don&#8217;t understand it well enough to do a really convincing job.  So, I&#8217;ll just muddle through by copying <a href="http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/12/this_weeks_finds_in_mathematic_46.html">Greg Egan&#8217;s explanation</a>.</p>
<p>First, let&#8217;s define a <b>Littlewood polynomial</b> to be one whose coefficients are all 1 or -1.  </p>
<p>We have already seen that if we take any number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="z" class="latex" />, then we get the image of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="z" class="latex" /> under all the Littlewood polynomials of degree <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" /> by starting with the point <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x = 0" class="latex" /> and applying these functions over and over:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%2B%28x%29+%3D+1+%2B+z+x+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_+(x) = 1 + z x " class="latex" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_-%28x%29+%3D+1+-+z+x+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_-(x) = 1 - z x " class="latex" /></p>
<p>a total of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%2B1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n+1" class="latex" /> times.</p>
<p>Moreover, we have seen that as we keep applying these functions over and over to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x = 0" class="latex" />, we get sequences that converge to points in the generalized dragon set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_z&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S_z" class="latex" />.  </p>
<p>So, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_z&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S_z" class="latex" /> is the set of limits of sequences that we get by taking the number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="z" class="latex" /> and applying Littlewood polynomials of larger and larger degree.</p>
<p>Now, suppose 0 is in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_z&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S_z" class="latex" />.  Then there are Littlewood polynomials of large degree applied to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="z" class="latex" /> that come very close to 0.  We get a picture like this:</p>
<div align="center"><img width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/RootHeuristic1.gif" /></div>
<p>where the arrows represent different Littlewood polynomials being applied to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="z" class="latex" />.  If we zoom in close enough that a linear approximation is good, we can see what the <i>inverse image</i> of 0 will look like under these polynomials:</p>
<div align="center"><img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/RootHeuristic2.gif" /></div>
<p>It will look the same!  But these inverse images are just the roots of the Littlewood polynomials.  So the roots of the Littlewood polynomials near <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="z" class="latex" /> will look like the generalized dragon set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_z&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S_z" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>As Greg put it:</p>
<blockquote><p>
But if we grab all these arrows:</p>
<div align="center"><img width="300" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/RootHeuristic1.gif" /></div>
<p>and squeeze their tips together so that they all map precisely to 0&#8212;and if we’re working in a small enough neighbourhood of 0 that the arrows don’t really change much as we move them&#8212;the pattern that imposes on the tails of the arrows will look a lot like the original pattern:</p>
<div align="center"><img width="300" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/RootHeuristic1.gif" /></div>
</blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot more to say, but I think I&#8217;ll stop soon.  I just want to emphasize that all this is modeled after the incredibly cool <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set#Relationship_with_Julia_sets">relationship between the Mandelbrot set and Julia sets</a>.  It goes like this;</p>
<p>Consider this function, which depends on a complex parameter <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="z" class="latex" />:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%29+%3D+x%5E2+%2B+z+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f(x) = x^2 + z " class="latex" /></p>
<p>If we fix <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="z," class="latex" /> this function defines a map from the complex plane to itself.  We can start with any number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> and keep applying this map over and over.  We get a sequence of numbers.  Sometimes this sequence shoots off to infinity and sometimes it doesn&#8217;t.  The boundary of the set where it doesn&#8217;t is called the <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set">Julia set</a></b> for this number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="z." class="latex" /></p>
<p>On the other hand, we can start with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x = 0" class="latex" />, and draw the set of numbers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="z" class="latex" /> for which the resulting sequence doesn&#8217;t shoot off to infinity.  That&#8217;s called the <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set">Mandelbrot set</a></b>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the cool relationship: in the vicinity of the number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="z," class="latex" /> the Mandelbrot set tends to look like the Julia set for that number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z+.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="z ." class="latex" />  This is especially true right at the boundary of the Mandelbrot set.</p>
<p>For example, the Julia set for</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z+%3D+-0.743643887037151+%2B+0.131825904205330+i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="z = -0.743643887037151 + 0.131825904205330 i" class="latex" /></p>
<p>looks like this:</p>

<p>is a tiny patch of the Mandelbrot set centered at the<br />
same value of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z+.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="z ." class="latex" />  They&#8217;re shockingly similar!</p>
<p>This is why the Mandelbrot set is so complicated.  Julia sets are<br />
already very complicated.  But the Mandelbrot set looks like <i>a<br />
lot</i> of Julia sets!  It&#8217;s like a big picture of someone&#8217;s face made of little pictures of different people&#8217;s faces. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a great picture illustrating this fact.  As with all the pictures here, you can click on it for a bigger view:</p>

<p>But this one you really <i>must</i> click on!</p>
<p>So, the Mandelbrot set is like an illustrated catalog of Julia sets.  Similarly, it seems the set of roots of Littlewood polynomials (up to a given degree) resembles a catalog of generalized dragon sets.  However, making this into a theorem would require me to make precise many things I&#8217;ve glossed over&#8212;mainly because I don&#8217;t understand them very well!</p>
<p>So, I&#8217;ll stop here.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Just in time for your holiday gift-giving, here&#8217;s my suggestion:</p>
<p>&bull; Richard Elwes, <i><a href="http://richardelwes.co.uk/mathematics-1001/">Mathematics 1001</a></i>, Quercus Books, 2010.</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://richardelwes.co.uk/mathematics-1001/"><br />
<img src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/elwes_mathematics_1001.jpg" /></a>
</div>
<p>The idea: 1001 bite-sized, juicy explanations of math topics ranging from the elementary:</p>
<p>&bull; how to do long division<br />
&bull; why multiplying two negative numbers gives a positive one<br />
&bull; why 0.9999&#8230; equals 1</p>
<p>to the slightly less elementary:</p>
<p>&bull; what&#8217;s the equation of a straight line?<br />
&bull; what are the basic identities that trig functions obey?<br />
&bull; how do you prove the product rule in calculus?</p>
<p>to the fun and easy: </p>
<p>&bull; What&#8217;s Goldbach&#8217;s conjecture and how much evidence do we have for it?<br />
&bull; What&#8217;s the golden ratio?<br />
&bull; What&#8217;s a Koch snowflake?</p>
<p>to the fun and harder:</p>
<p>&bull; What&#8217;s the abc conjecture?<br />
&bull; What&#8217;s a Julia set?<br />
&bull; What&#8217;s Chaitin&#8217;s number &Omega;?<br />
&bull; What&#8217;s Tarski&#8217;s geometric decidability theorem?</p>
<p>to the stuff all mathematicians need to know, but ordinary folks don&#8217;t:</p>
<p>&bull; What&#8217;s the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality?<br />
&bull; What&#8217;s a Fourier series?<br />
&bull; What are grad, div and curl?<br />
&bull; What&#8217;s the classification of closed surfaces?<br />
&bull; What&#8217;s a permutation group?</p>
<p>to the stuff all mathematicians want to understand, but find intimidating:</p>
<p>&bull; What is a scheme?<br />
&bull; What&#8217;s the Langlands program?<br />
&bull; What&#8217;s forcing?<br />
&bull; What&#8217;s a derived category?</p>
<p>The more advanced topics are covered in a sketchy way, so you will <i>not</i> walk out knowing complete answers to all these questions.  And that&#8217;s just as well, because otherwise the book would be a lot longer than 409 pages, and nobody would be able to read it all!</p>
<p>What you <i>will</i> get is some rough sense of all what all these things are&#8230; and you&#8217;ll have a lot of fun in the process.  You can start reading the book anywhere: it&#8217;s not a treatise, it&#8217;s a bunch of tasty appetizers.  So, you can set it by your bed or somewhere in the living room, and dip into it whenever you have some spare time.</p>
<p>I really, really wish I&#8217;d had a book like this when I was younger.   Math is a huge enchanted kingdom with many highways and byways, dark forests and dragon-infested mountain ranges.  It took me decades to wander across it, extricate myself from various tar pits, and get some sense of the overall lay of the land.  This book would have sped that process immensely, in a very pleasant way.</p>
<p>So if you&#8217;d like to know more about math, get this book!  And if you know a kid, or friend, who is interested in math but not yet an expert, give them this book! </p>
<p>As a professional showoff and know-it-all, I was chagrined (though also secretly pleased) that there are some things in this book I did not know about.  They&#8217;re mainly open problems in number theory.  I guess this subject holds a lot of the most easily stated and hard-to-prove conjectures, so Elwes included a bunch, including these I&#8217;d never heard of:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre%27s_conjecture">Legendre&#8217;s conjecture</a>.<br />
&bull; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polignac%27s_conjecture">de Polignac&#8217;s conjecture</a>.<br />
&bull; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schinzel%27s_hypothesis_H">Hypothesis H</a>.<br />
&bull; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrica%27s_conjecture">Andrica&#8217;s conjecture</a>.<br />
&bull; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beal%27s_conjecture">Beals&#8217; conjecture</a>.</p>
<p>By the way, if you saw the recent post Richard Elwes and I wrote on <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/12/02/babylon-and-the-square-root-of-2/">Babylonian mathematics</a>, you may think it&#8217;s some sort of conflict of interest for me to be touting his book now.  However, that would be putting Descartes before the horse!  In fact what happened is this.  He sent me a copy of his book, I liked it, I wanted to post an article about it, I saw an interesting post of his about a Babylonian clay tablet on Google+, I decided to expand it with him here on this blog, and finally I&#8217;m talking about his book!</p>

				<small>2 December, 2011</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p><i>joint with <b><a href="http://richardelwes.co.uk/">Richard Elwes</a></b></i></p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/YBC7289.jpg"><img width="400" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/YBC7289.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>Sometimes you can learn a lot from an old piece of clay.  This is a Babylonian clay tablet from around 1700 BC.  It&#8217;s known as &#8220;YBC7289&#8221;, since it&#8217;s one of many in the Yale Babylonian Collection.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a diagram of a square with one side marked as having length 1/2.  They took this length, multiplied it by the square root of 2, and got the length of the diagonal.  And our question is: what did they really know about the square root of 2?</p>
<p>Questions like this are tricky.  It&#8217;s even hard to be sure the square&#8217;s side has length 1/2.  Since the Babylonians used base 60, they thought of 1/2 as 30/60.   But since they hadn&#8217;t invented anything like a &#8220;decimal point&#8221;, they wrote it as 30.  More precisely, they wrote it as this:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/Babylonian_symbol_for_30.gif" /></div>
<p>Take a look.</p>
<p>So maybe the square&#8217;s side has length 1/2&#8230; but maybe it has length 30.  How can we tell?  We can&#8217;t. But this tablet was probably written by a beginner, since the writing is large.  And for a beginner, or indeed any mathematician, it makes a lot of sense to take 1/2 and multiply it by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B2%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;sqrt{2}" class="latex" /> to get <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B2%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;frac{1}{&#92;sqrt{2}}" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>Once you start worrying about these things, there&#8217;s no end to it.  How do we know the Babylonians wrote 1/2 as 30?  One reason is that they really liked reciprocals.  According to J&ouml;ran Friberg&#8217;s book <i>A Remarkable Collection of Babylonian Mathematical Texts</i>, there are tablets where a teacher has set some unfortunate student the task of inverting some truly gigantic numbers such as 3<sup>25</sup> &middot; 5.  They even checked their answers the obvious way: by taking the reciprocal of the reciprocal!  They put together tables of reciprocals and used these to tackle more general division problems.  To calculate <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7Ba%7D%7Bb%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;frac{a}{b}" class="latex" /> they would break <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="b" class="latex" /> up into factors, look up the reciprocal of each, and take the product of these together with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a" class="latex" />.  This is cool, because modern algebra also sees reciprocals as logically preceding division, even if most non-mathematicians disagree!</p>
<p>So, we know from tables of reciprocals that Babylonians wrote 1/2 as 30.   But let&#8217;s get back to our original question: what did they know about <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B2%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;sqrt{2}" class="latex" />?</p>
<p>On this tablet, they used the value</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+1+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B24%7D%7B60%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B51%7D%7B60%5E2%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B10%7D%7B60%5E3%7D+%5Capprox+1.41421297...+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ 1 + &#92;frac{24}{60} + &#92;frac{51}{60^2} + &#92;frac{10}{60^3} &#92;approx 1.41421297... }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>This is an impressively good approximation to</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B2%7D+%5Capprox+1.41421356...+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;sqrt{2} &#92;approx 1.41421356... " class="latex" /></p>
<p>But how did they get this approximation?  Did they know it was just an approximation?  And did they know <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B2%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;sqrt{2}" class="latex" /> is irrational?</p>
<p>There seems to be no evidence that they knew about irrational numbers.  One of the great experts on Babylonian mathematics, Otto Neugebauer, wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8230; even if it were only due to our incomplete knowledge of the sources that we assume that the Babylonians did not know that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%5E2+%3D+2q%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p^2 = 2q^2" class="latex" /> had no solution in integer numbers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="q" class="latex" />, even then the fact remains that the consequences of this result were never realized.
</p></blockquote>
<p>But there <i>is</i> evidence that the Babylonians knew their figure was just an approximation.  In his book <i>The Crest of the Peacock</i>, George Gheverghese Joseph points out that a number very much like this shows up at the fourth stage of a fairly obvious recursive algorithm for approximating square roots! The first three approximations are</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="1 " class="latex" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7B3%7D%7B2%7D+%3D+1.5+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{3}{2} = 1.5 }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7B17%7D%7B12%7D+%5Capprox+1.41666...+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{17}{12} &#92;approx 1.41666... }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>The fourth is</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7B577%7D%7B408%7D+%5Capprox+1.41421569...+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{577}{408} &#92;approx 1.41421569... }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>but if you work it out to 3 places in base 60, as the Babylonians seem to have done, you&#8217;ll get the number on this tablet!</p>
<p>The number 577/408 also shows up as an approximation to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B2%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;sqrt{2}" class="latex" /> in the <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shulba_Sutras">Shulba Sutras</a></i>, a collection of Indian texts compiled between 800 and 200 BC.  So, Indian mathematicians may have known the same algorithm.</p>
<p>But what is this algorithm, exactly?  Joseph describes it, but Sridhar Ramesh told us about an easier way to think about it.   Suppose you&#8217;re trying to compute the square root of 2 and you have a guess, say <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a" class="latex" />.  If your guess is exactly right then</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%5E2+%3D+2+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a^2 = 2 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>so</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a+%3D+2%2Fa+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a = 2/a " class="latex" /></p>
<p>But if your guess isn&#8217;t right, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a" class="latex" /> won&#8217;t be quite equal to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%2Fa&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="2/a" class="latex" />.  So it makes sense to take the <i>average</i> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%2Fa&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="2/a" class="latex" />, and use that as a new guess.  If your original guess wasn&#8217;t too bad, and you keep using this procedure, you&#8217;ll get a sequence of guesses that converges to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B2%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;sqrt{2}" class="latex" />.  In fact it converges very rapidly: at each step, the number of correct digits in your guess will approximately double!</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see how it goes.  We start with an obvious dumb guess, namely 1.  Now 1 sure isn&#8217;t equal to 2/1, but we can average them and get a better guess:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%281+%5C%3B%2B+%5C%3B+2%29+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B3%7D%7B2%7D+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{1}{2}(1 &#92;;+ &#92;; 2) = &#92;frac{3}{2} }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>Next, let&#8217;s average 3/2 and 2/(3/2):</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7B3%7D%7B2%7D+%5C%3B+%2B+%5C%3B+%5Cfrac%7B2%7D%7B%5Cfrac%7B3%7D%7B2%7D%7D%5Cright%29+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7B3%7D%7B2%7D+%5C%3B+%2B+%5C%3B+%5Cfrac%7B4%7D%7B3%7D%5Cright%29+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7B3+%5Ccdot+3+%2B+2+%5Ccdot+4%7D%7B2+%5Ccdot+3%7D%5Cright%29+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B9+%2B+8%7D%7B12%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B17%7D%7B12%7D+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{1}{2}&#92;left(&#92;frac{3}{2} &#92;; + &#92;; &#92;frac{2}{&#92;frac{3}{2}}&#92;right) = &#92;frac{1}{2}&#92;left(&#92;frac{3}{2} &#92;; + &#92;; &#92;frac{4}{3}&#92;right) = &#92;frac{1}{2}&#92;left(&#92;frac{3 &#92;cdot 3 + 2 &#92;cdot 4}{2 &#92;cdot 3}&#92;right) = &#92;frac{9 + 8}{12} = &#92;frac{17}{12} } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>We&#8217;re doing the calculation in painstaking detail for two reasons.  First, we want to prove that we&#8217;re just as good at arithmetic as the ancient Babylonians: we don&#8217;t need a calculator for this stuff! Second, a cute pattern will show up if you pay attention.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s do the next step.  Now we&#8217;ll average 17/12 and 2/(17/12):</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7B17%7D%7B12%7D+%5C%3B+%2B+%5C%3B+%5Cfrac%7B2%7D%7B%5Cfrac%7B17%7D%7B12%7D%7D%5Cright%29+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7B17%7D%7B12%7D+%5C%3B+%2B+%5C%3B+%5Cfrac%7B24%7D%7B17%7D%5Cright%29+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7B17+%5Ccdot+17+%2B+12+%5Ccdot+24%7D%7B12+%5Ccdot+17%7D%5Cright%29+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{1}{2}&#92;left(&#92;frac{17}{12} &#92;; + &#92;; &#92;frac{2}{&#92;frac{17}{12}}&#92;right) = &#92;frac{1}{2}&#92;left(&#92;frac{17}{12} &#92;; + &#92;; &#92;frac{24}{17}&#92;right) = &#92;frac{1}{2}&#92;left(&#92;frac{17 &#92;cdot 17 + 12 &#92;cdot 24}{12 &#92;cdot 17}&#92;right) } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Do you remember what 17 times 17 is?  No?  That&#8217;s bad.  It&#8217;s 289.  Do you remember what 12 times 24 is?  Well, maybe you remember that 12 times 12 is 144.  So, double that and get 288.  Hmm.  So, moving right along, we get</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7B289+%2B+288%7D%7B204%7D%5Cright%29+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B577%7D%7B408%7D++%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{1}{2}&#92;left(&#92;frac{289 + 288}{204}&#92;right) = &#92;frac{577}{408}  }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>which is what the Babylonians seem to have used!</p>
<p>Do you see the cute pattern?  No?  Yes?  Even if you do, it&#8217;s good to try another round of this game, to see if this pattern persists.  Besides, it&#8217;ll be fun to beat the Babylonians at their own game and get a better approximation to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B2%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;sqrt{2}" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>So, let&#8217;s average 577/408 and 2/(577/408):</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Bccl%7D+%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7B577%7D%7B408%7D+%5C%3B+%2B+%5C%3B+%5Cfrac%7B2%7D%7B%5Cfrac%7B577%7D%7B408%7D%7D%5Cright%29+%7D+%26%3D%26+%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7B577%7D%7B408%7D+%5C%3B+%2B+%5C%3B+%5Cfrac%7B816%7D%7B577%7D%5Cright%29+%7D++%5C%5C++%5C%5C+%26%3D%26+%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7B577+%5Ccdot+577+%2B+816+%5Ccdot+408%7D%7B408+%5Ccdot+577%7D%5Cright%29+%7D+%5Cend%7Barray%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;begin{array}{ccl} &#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{1}{2}&#92;left(&#92;frac{577}{408} &#92;; + &#92;; &#92;frac{2}{&#92;frac{577}{408}}&#92;right) } &amp;=&amp; &#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{1}{2}&#92;left(&#92;frac{577}{408} &#92;; + &#92;; &#92;frac{816}{577}&#92;right) }  &#92;&#92;  &#92;&#92; &amp;=&amp; &#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{1}{2}&#92;left(&#92;frac{577 &#92;cdot 577 + 816 &#92;cdot 408}{408 &#92;cdot 577}&#92;right) } &#92;end{array} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Do you remember what 577 times 577 is?  Heh, neither do we.  In fact, right now a calculator is starting to look really good.  Okay: it says the answer is 332,929.  And what about 816 times 408?  That&#8217;s 332,928.  Just one less!  And that&#8217;s the pattern we were hinting at: it&#8217;s been working like that every time.  Continuing, we get</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7B332%2C929+%2B+332%2C928%7D%7B235%2C416%7D%5Cright%29+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B665%2C857%7D%7B470%2C832%7D+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{1}{2}&#92;left(&#92;frac{332,929 + 332,928}{235,416}&#92;right) = &#92;frac{665,857}{470,832} }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>So that&#8217;s our new approximation of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B2%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;sqrt{2}" class="latex" />, which is <i>even better than the best known in 1700 BC!</i> Let&#8217;s see how good it is:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Bccc%7D+%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7B665%2C857%7D%7B470%2C832%7D+%7D%5C%3B+%26%5Capprox+%26+1.414213562375...+%5C%5C+%26+%26+%5C%5C++%5Csqrt%7B2%7D+%5C%3B+%26%5Capprox+%26+1.414213562373...%5Cend%7Barray%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;begin{array}{ccc} &#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{665,857}{470,832} }&#92;; &amp;&#92;approx &amp; 1.414213562375... &#92;&#92; &amp; &amp; &#92;&#92;  &#92;sqrt{2} &#92;; &amp;&#92;approx &amp; 1.414213562373...&#92;end{array} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>So, it&#8217;s good to 11 decimals!</p>
<p>What about that pattern we saw?  As you can see, we keep getting a square number that&#8217;s one more than <i>twice</i> some other square:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3%5E2+%3D+2+%5Ccdot+2%5E2+%2B+1+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="3^2 = 2 &#92;cdot 2^2 + 1 " class="latex" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=17%5E2+%3D+2+%5Ccdot+12%5E2+%2B+1+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="17^2 = 2 &#92;cdot 12^2 + 1 " class="latex" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=577%5E2+%3D+2+%5Ccdot+408%5E2+%2B+1+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="577^2 = 2 &#92;cdot 408^2 + 1 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>and so on&#8230; at least if the pattern continues.  So, while we can&#8217;t find integers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="q" class="latex" /> with</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%5E2+%3D+2+q%5E2+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p^2 = 2 q^2 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>because <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B2%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;sqrt{2}" class="latex" /> is irrational, it seems we can find infinitely many solutions to</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%5E2+%3D+2+q%5E2+%2B+1+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p^2 = 2 q^2 + 1 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>and these give fractions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%2Fq&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p/q" class="latex" /> that are really good approximations to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B2%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;sqrt{2}" class="latex" />.  But can you prove this is really what&#8217;s going on?</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll leave this as a puzzle in case you&#8217;re ever stuck on a desert island, or stuck in the deserts of Iraq.  And if you want even more fun, try simplifying these fractions:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+1+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ 1 + &#92;frac{1}{2} } " class="latex" /></p>

<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+1+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2+%2B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%7D%7D+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ 1 + &#92;frac{1}{2 + &#92;frac{1}{2 +&#92;frac{1}{2}}} } " class="latex" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+1+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2+%2B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%7D%7D%7D+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ 1 + &#92;frac{1}{2 + &#92;frac{1}{2 +&#92;frac{1}{2 + &#92;frac{1}{2}}}} } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>and so on.  Some will give you the fractions we&#8217;ve seen already, but others won&#8217;t.  How far out do you need to go to get 577/408?  Can you figure the pattern and see when 665,857/470,832 will show up?</p>
<p>If you get stuck, it may help to read about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pell_number">Pell numbers</a>.  We could say more, but we&#8217;re beginning to babble on.</p>

<p><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/11/12/network-theory-part-17/">Last time</a> we explained how &#8216;reaction networks&#8217;, as used in chemistry, are just another way of talking about Petri nets.  We stated an amazing result, the deficiency zero theorem, which settles quite a number of questions about chemical reactions.  Now let&#8217;s illustrate it with an example.</p>
<p>Our example won&#8217;t show how <i>powerful</i> this theorem is: it&#8217;s too simple.  But it&#8217;ll help explain the ideas involved.</p>
<h4> Diatomic molecules </h4>
<p>A diatomic molecule consists of two atoms of the same kind, stuck together:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/nitrogen.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>At room temperature there are 5 elements that are diatomic gases: hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, chlorine.  Bromine is a diatomic liquid, but easily evaporates into a diatomic gas:</p>
<div align="center"><img border="2" width="230" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/bromine.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p>Iodine is a crystal at room temperatures:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/iodine_crystal.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>but if you heat it a bit, it becomes a diatomic liquid and then a gas:</p>
<div align="center"><img border="2" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/iodine.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p>so people often list it as a seventh member of the diatomic club.  </p>
<p>When you heat any diatomic gas enough, it starts becoming a &#8216;monatomic&#8217; gas as molecules break down into individual atoms.  However, just as a diatomic molecule can break apart into two  atoms:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A_2+%5Cto+A+%2B+A+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A_2 &#92;to A + A " class="latex" /></p>
<p>two atoms can recombine to form a diatomic molecule:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+%2B+A+%5Cto+A_2+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A + A &#92;to A_2 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>So in equilibrium, the gas will be a mixture of diatomic and monatomic forms.   The exact amount of each will depend on the temperature and pressure, since these affect the likelihood that two colliding atoms stick together, or a diatomic molecule splits apart.   The detailed nature of our gas also matters, of course.</p>
<p>But we don&#8217;t need to get into these details here!  Instead, we can just write down the &#8216;rate equation&#8217; for the reactions we&#8217;re talking about. All the details we&#8217;re ignoring will be hiding in some constants called &#8216;rate constants&#8217;.  We won&#8217;t try to compute these; we&#8217;ll leave that to our chemist friends.</p>
<h4> A reaction network </h4>
<p>To write down our rate equation, we start by drawing a &#8216;reaction network&#8217;.    For this, we can be a bit abstract and call the diatomic molecule <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B" class="latex" /> instead of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A_2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A_2" class="latex" />.  Then it looks like this:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="200" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/chemical_reaction_network_part_18.png" alt="" />
</div>
<p>We could write down the same information using a Petri net:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="400" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/petri_net_part_18.png" alt="" />
</div>
<p>But today let&#8217;s focus on the reaction network!  Staring at this picture, we can read off various things: </p>
<p>&bull; <b>Species.</b>  The species are the different kinds of atoms, molecules, etc.  In our example the set of species is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S+%3D+%5C%7BA%2C+B%5C%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S = &#92;{A, B&#92;}" class="latex" />.  </p>
<p>&bull; <b>Complexes.</b> A complex is a finite sum of species, like <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A," class="latex" /> or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+%2B+A%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A + A," class="latex" /> or for a fancier example using more efficient notation, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2+A+%2B+3+B.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="2 A + 3 B." class="latex" />    So, we can think of a complex as a vector <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5ES.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="v &#92;in &#92;mathbb{R}^S." class="latex" />  The complexes that actually show up in our reaction network form a set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C+%5Csubseteq+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5ES.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C &#92;subseteq &#92;mathbb{R}^S." class="latex" />  In our example, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C+%3D+%5C%7BA%2BA%2C+B%5C%7D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C = &#92;{A+A, B&#92;}." class="latex" /> </p>
<p>&bull; <b>Reactions.</b> A reaction is an arrow going from one complex to another.  In our example we have two reactions: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+%2B+A+%5Cto+B&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A + A &#92;to B" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B+%5Cto+A+%2B+A.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B &#92;to A + A." class="latex" />   </p>
<p>Chemists define a <b>reaction network</b> to be a triple <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28S%2C+C%2C+T%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(S, C, T)" class="latex" /> where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S" class="latex" /> is a set of species, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C" class="latex" /> is the set of complexes that appear in the reactions, and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T" class="latex" /> is the set of reactions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v+%5Cto+w&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="v &#92;to w" class="latex" /> where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v%2C+w+%5Cin+C.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="v, w &#92;in C." class="latex" />  (Stochastic Petri net people call reactions <b>transitions</b>, hence the letter <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T." class="latex" />)</p>
<p>So, in our example we have:</p>
<p>&bull; Species <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S+%3D+%5C%7BA%2CB%5C%7D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S = &#92;{A,B&#92;}." class="latex" />  </p>
<p>&bull; Complexes: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C%3D+%5C%7BA%2BA%2C+B%5C%7D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C= &#92;{A+A, B&#92;}." class="latex" />  </p>
<p>&bull; Reactions: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T+%3D++%5C%7BA%2BA%5Cto+B%2C+B%5Cto+A%2BA%5C%7D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T =  &#92;{A+A&#92;to B, B&#92;to A+A&#92;}." class="latex" /></p>
<p>To get the rate equation, we also need one more piece of information: a <b>rate constant</b> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%28%5Ctau%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r(&#92;tau)" class="latex" /> for each reaction <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau+%5Cin+T.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;tau &#92;in T." class="latex" />  This is a nonnegative real number that affects how fast the reaction goes.  All the details of how our particular diatomic gas behaves at a given temperature and pressure are packed into these constants!  </p>
<h4> The rate equation </h4>
<p>The rate equation says how the expected numbers of the various species&mdash;atoms, molecules and the like&mdash;changes with time.  This equation is deterministic.   It&#8217;s a good approximation when the numbers are large and any fluctuations in these numbers are negligible by comparison.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the general form of the <b><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/09/09/network-theory-part-8/">rate equation</a></b>:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7Bd%7D%7Bd+t%7D+x_i+%3D++%5Csum_%7B%5Ctau%5Cin+T%7D+r%28%5Ctau%29+%5C%2C+%28n_i%28%5Ctau%29-m_i%28%5Ctau%29%29+%5C%2C+x%5E%7Bm%28%5Ctau%29%7D++%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{d}{d t} x_i =  &#92;sum_{&#92;tau&#92;in T} r(&#92;tau) &#92;, (n_i(&#92;tau)-m_i(&#92;tau)) &#92;, x^{m(&#92;tau)}  } " class="latex" /> </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a closer look.  The quantity <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x_i" class="latex" /> is the expected population of the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i" class="latex" />th species.  So, this equation tells us how that changes.   But what about the right hand side?  As you might expect, it&#8217;s a sum over reactions.  And:</p>
<p>&bull; The term for the reaction <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;tau" class="latex" /> is proportional to the rate constant <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%28%5Ctau%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r(&#92;tau)." class="latex" /> </p>
<p>&bull; Each reaction <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;tau" class="latex" /> goes between two complexes, so we can write it as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%28%5Ctau%29+%5Cto+n%28%5Ctau%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="m(&#92;tau) &#92;to n(&#92;tau)." class="latex" />  Among chemists the input <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%28%5Ctau%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="m(&#92;tau)" class="latex" /> is called the <b>reactant complex</b>, and the output is called the <b>product complex</b>.  The difference <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n_i%28%5Ctau%29-m_i%28%5Ctau%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n_i(&#92;tau)-m_i(&#92;tau)" class="latex" /> tells us how many items of species <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i" class="latex" /> get created, minus how many get destroyed.  So, it&#8217;s the net amount of this species that gets produced by the reaction <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;tau." class="latex" />  The term for the reaction <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;tau" class="latex" /> is proportional to this, too.</p>
<p>&bull; Finally, the <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_mass_action">law of mass action</a></b> says that the rate of a reaction is proportional to the product of the concentrations of the species that enter as inputs.  More precisely, if we have a reaction <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;tau" class="latex" /> with input is the complex <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%28%5Ctau%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="m(&#92;tau)" class="latex" />, we define <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E%7Bm%28%5Ctau%29%7D+%3D+x_1%5E%7Bm_1%28%5Ctau%29%7D+%5Ccdots+x_k%5E%7Bm_k%28%5Ctau%29%7D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x^{m(&#92;tau)} = x_1^{m_1(&#92;tau)} &#92;cdots x_k^{m_k(&#92;tau)}." class="latex" />  The law of mass action says the term for the reaction <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;tau" class="latex" /> is proportional to this, too!</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see what this says for the reaction network we&#8217;re studying:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="200" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/chemical_reaction_network_part_18.png" alt="" />
</div>
<p>Let&#8217;s write <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1%28t%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x_1(t)" class="latex" /> for the number of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> atoms and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_2%28t%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x_2(t)" class="latex" /> for the number of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B" class="latex" /> molecules.   Let the rate constant for the reaction <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B+%5Cto+A+%2B+A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B &#92;to A + A" class="latex" /> be <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;alpha," class="latex" /> and let the rate constant for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+%2B+A+%5Cto+B&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A + A &#92;to B" class="latex" /> be <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta," class="latex" />   Then the rate equation is this:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B%5Cfrac%7Bd%7D%7Bd+t%7D+x_1+%3D++2+%5Calpha+x_2+-+2+%5Cbeta+x_1%5E2+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{&#92;frac{d}{d t} x_1 =  2 &#92;alpha x_2 - 2 &#92;beta x_1^2 }" class="latex" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B%5Cfrac%7Bd%7D%7Bd+t%7D+x_2+%3D+-%5Calpha+x_2+%2B+%5Cbeta+x_1%5E2+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{&#92;frac{d}{d t} x_2 = -&#92;alpha x_2 + &#92;beta x_1^2 }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>This is a bit intimidating.  However, we can solve it in closed form thanks to something very precious: a <i>conserved quantity</i>.  </p>
<p>We&#8217;ve got two species, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B" class="latex" />.  But remember, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B" class="latex" /> is just an abbreviation for a molecule made of two <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> atoms.   So, the total number of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> atoms is conserved by the reactions in our network.  This is the number of <i>A</i>&#8216;s plus twice the number of <i>B</i>&#8216;s: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1+%2B+2x_2.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x_1 + 2x_2." class="latex" />  So, this should be a <b>conserved quantity</b>: it should not change with time.  Indeed, by adding the first equation above to twice the second, we see:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B%5Cfrac%7Bd%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%5Cleft%28+x_1+%2B+2x_2+%5Cright%29+%3D+0+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{&#92;frac{d}{d t} &#92;left( x_1 + 2x_2 &#92;right) = 0 }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>As a consequence, any solution will stay on a line </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1+%2B+2+x_2+%3D+c+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x_1 + 2 x_2 = c " class="latex" /></p>
<p>for some constant <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c" class="latex" />.  We can use this fact to rewrite the rate equation just in terms of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x_1" class="latex" />:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7Bd%7D%7Bd+t%7D+x_1+%3D+%5Calpha+%282c+-+x_1%29+-+2+%5Cbeta+x_1%5E2+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{d}{d t} x_1 = &#92;alpha (2c - x_1) - 2 &#92;beta x_1^2 } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>This is a separable differential equation, so we can solve it if we can figure out how to do this integral </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+t+%3D+%5Cint+%5Cfrac%7Bd+x_1%7D%7B%5Calpha+%282c+-+x_1%29+-+2+%5Cbeta+x_1%5E2+%7D++%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ t = &#92;int &#92;frac{d x_1}{&#92;alpha (2c - x_1) - 2 &#92;beta x_1^2 }  } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>and then solve for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x_1." class="latex" /></p>
<p>This sort of trick won&#8217;t work for more complicated examples.<br />
But the idea remains important: the numbers of atoms of various kinds&mdash;hydrogen, helium, lithium, and so on&mdash;are conserved by chemical reactions, so a solution of the rate equation can&#8217;t roam freely in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5ES.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}^S." class="latex" />  It will be trapped on some hypersurface, which is called a &#8216;stoichiometric compatibility class&#8217;.  And this is very important.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t feel like doing the integral required to solve our rate equation in closed form, because this idea doesn&#8217;t generalize too much.  On the other hand, we can always solve the rate equation numerically.  So let&#8217;s try that!</p>
<p>For example, suppose we set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha+%3D+%5Cbeta+%3D+1.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;alpha = &#92;beta = 1." class="latex" />  We can plot the solutions for three different choices of initial conditions, say <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x_1%2Cx_2%29+%3D+%280%2C3%29%2C+%284%2C0%29%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(x_1,x_2) = (0,3), (4,0)," class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%283%2C3%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(3,3)" class="latex" />.  We get these graphs:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/part-18-concentration-plots.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>It looks like the solution always approaches an equilibrium.   We seem to be getting different equilibria for different initial conditions, and the pattern is a bit mysterious.   However, something nice happens when we plot the ratio <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1%5E2+%2F+x_2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x_1^2 / x_2" class="latex" />: </p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/part-18-ratio-plots.png" alt="" />
</div>
<p>Apparently it always converges to 1.   Why should that be?  It&#8217;s not terribly surprising.  With both rate constants equal to 1, the reaction <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+%2B+A+%5Cto+B&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A + A &#92;to B" class="latex" /> proceeds at a rate equal to the square of the number of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" />&#8216;s, namely <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x_1^2" class="latex" />.  The reverse reaction proceeds at a rate equal to the number of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B" class="latex" />&#8216;s, namely <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_2.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x_2." class="latex" />  So in equilibrium, we should have <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1%5E2+%3D+x_2.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x_1^2 = x_2." class="latex" /></p>
<p>But why is the equilibrium <i>stable</i>?  In this example we could see that using the closed-form solution, or maybe just common sense.   But it also follows from a powerful theorem that handles a <i>lot</i> of reaction networks.</p>
<h4> The deficiency zero theorem </h4>
<p>It&#8217;s called Feinberg&#8217;s deficiency zero theorem, and we saw it <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/11/12/network-theory-part-17/">last time</a>.  Very roughly, it says that if our reaction network is &#8216;weakly reversible&#8217; and has &#8216;deficiency zero&#8217;, the rate equation will have equilibrium solutions that behave about as nicely as you could want.  </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see how this works.   We need to remember some jargon:</p>
<p>&bull; <b>Weakly reversible.</b> A reaction network is <b>weakly reversible</b> if for every reaction <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v+%5Cto+w&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="v &#92;to w" class="latex" /> in the network, there exists a path of reactions in the network starting at <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="w" class="latex" /> and leading back to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="v." class="latex" /></p>
<p>&bull; <b>Reversible.</b>   A reaction network is <b>reversible</b> if for every reaction <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v+%5Cto+w&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="v &#92;to w" class="latex" /> in the network, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w+%5Cto+v&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="w &#92;to v" class="latex" /> is also a reaction in the network.    Any reversible reaction network is weakly reversible.   Our example is reversible, since it consists of reactions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+%2B+A+%5Cto+B%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A + A &#92;to B," class="latex" /> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B+%5Cto+A+%2B+A.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B &#92;to A + A." class="latex" /> </p>
<p>But what about &#8216;deficiency zero&#8217;?  We defined that concept <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/11/12/network-theory-part-17/">last time</a>, but let&#8217;s review:</p>
<p>&bull; <b>Connected component.</b>  A reaction network gives a kind of graph with complexes as vertices and reactions as edges.  Two complexes lie in the same  <b>connected component</b> if we can get from one to the other by a path of reactions, where at each step we&#8217;re allowed to go either forward <i>or backward</i> along a reaction.  Chemists call a connected component a <b>linkage class</b>.  In our example there&#8217;s just one:</p>
<div align="center"><img width="200" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/chemical_reaction_network_part_18.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>&bull; <b>Stoichiometric subspace.</b>  The <b>stoichiometric subspace</b> is the subspace <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BStoch%7D+%5Csubseteq+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5ES&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{Stoch} &#92;subseteq &#92;mathbb{R}^S" class="latex" /> spanned by the vectors of the form <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w+-+v&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="w - v" class="latex" /> for all reactions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v+%5Cto+w&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="v &#92;to w" class="latex" /> in our reaction network.    This subspace describes the directions in which a solution of the rate equation can move.  In our example, it&#8217;s spanned by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B+-+2+A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B - 2 A" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2+A+-+B&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="2 A - B" class="latex" />, or if you prefer, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28-2%2C1%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(-2,1)" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%282%2C-1%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(2,-1)." class="latex" />  These vectors are linearly dependent, so the stoichiometric subspace has dimension 1.  </p>
<p>&bull; <b>Deficiency.</b>  The <b>deficiency</b> of a reaction network is the number of complexes, minus the number of connected components, minus the dimension of the stoichiometric subspace.  In our example there are 2 complexes, 1 connected component, and the dimension of the stoichiometric subspace is 1.  So, our reaction network has deficiency 2 &#8211; 1 &#8211; 1 = 0.  </p>
<p>So, the deficiency zero theorem applies!  What does it say?  To understand it, we need a bit more jargon.  First of all, a vector <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5ES&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x &#92;in &#92;mathbb{R}^S" class="latex" /> tells us how much we&#8217;ve got of each species: the amount of species <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i+%5Cin+S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i &#92;in S" class="latex" /> is the number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_i.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x_i." class="latex" />  And then:</p>
<p>&bull; <b>Stoichiometric compatibility class.</b>  Given a vector <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5ES&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="v&#92;in &#92;mathbb{R}^S" class="latex" />, its <b>stoichiometric compatibility class</b> is the subset of all vectors that we could reach using the reactions in our reaction network:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B+v+%2B+w+%5C%3B+%3A+%5C%3B+w+%5Cin+%5Cmathrm%7BStoch%7D+%5C%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;{ v + w &#92;; : &#92;; w &#92;in &#92;mathrm{Stoch} &#92;} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>In our example, where the stoichiometric subspace is spanned by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%282%2C-1%29%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(2,-1)," class="latex" /> the stoichiometric compatibility class of the vector <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28v_1%2Cv_2%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(v_1,v_2)" class="latex" /> is the line consisting of points</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x_1%2C+x_2%29+%3D+%28v_1%2Cv_2%29+%2B+s%282%2C-1%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(x_1, x_2) = (v_1,v_2) + s(2,-1) " class="latex" /></p>
<p>where the parameter <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="s" class="latex" /> ranges over all real numbers.  Notice that this line can also be written as</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1+%2B+2x_2+%3D+c+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x_1 + 2x_2 = c " class="latex" /></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve already seen that if we start with initial conditions on such a line, the solution will stay on this line.  And that&#8217;s how it always works: as time passes, any solution of the rate equation stays in the same stoichiometric compatibility class!  </p>
<p>In other words: <i>the stoichiometric subspace is defined by a bunch of linear equations, one for each linear conservation law that all the reactions in our network obey.</i>   </p>
<p>Here a <b>linear conservation law</b> is a law saying that some linear combination of the numbers of species does not change.</p>
<p>Next: </p>
<p>&bull; <b>Positivity.</b>  A vector in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5ES&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}^S" class="latex" /> is <b>positive</b> if all its components are positive; this describes a a container of chemicals where all the species are actually present.  The <b>positive stoichiometric compatibility class</b> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5ES&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x&#92;in &#92;mathbb{R}^S" class="latex" /> consists of all positive vectors in its stoichiometric compatibility class.</p>
<p>We finally have enough jargon in our arsenal to state the zero deficiency theorem.  We&#8217;ll only state the part we need today:</p>
<p><b>Zero Deficiency Theorem (Feinberg).</b>  If a reaction network has deficiency zero and is weakly reversible, and the rate constants are positive, the rate equation has exactly one equilibrium solution in each positive stoichiometric compatibility class.  Any sufficiently nearby solution that starts in the same class will approach this equilibrium as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t+%5Cto+%2B%5Cinfty.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="t &#92;to +&#92;infty." class="latex" /></p>
<p>In our example, this theorem says there&#8217;s just one positive<br />
equilibrium <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x_1%2Cx_2%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(x_1,x_2)" class="latex" /> in each line</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1+%2B+2x_2+%3D+c+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x_1 + 2x_2 = c " class="latex" /></p>
<p>We can find it by setting the time derivatives to zero:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7Bd%7D%7Bd+t%7Dx_1+%3D++2+%5Calpha+x_2+-+2+%5Cbeta+x_1%5E2+%3D+0+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{d}{d t}x_1 =  2 &#92;alpha x_2 - 2 &#92;beta x_1^2 = 0 } " class="latex" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7Bd%7D%7Bd+t%7D+x_2+%3D+-%5Calpha+x_2+%2B+%5Cbeta+x_1%5E2+%3D+0+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{d}{d t} x_2 = -&#92;alpha x_2 + &#92;beta x_1^2 = 0 }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>Solving these, we get</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7Bx_1%5E2%7D%7Bx_2%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B%5Calpha%7D%7B%5Cbeta%7D+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{x_1^2}{x_2} = &#92;frac{&#92;alpha}{&#92;beta} }" class="latex" /> </p>
<p>So, these are our equilibrium solutions.  It&#8217;s easy to verify that indeed, there&#8217;s one of these in each stoichiometric compatibility class <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1+%2B+2x_2+%3D+c.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x_1 + 2x_2 = c." class="latex" />  And the zero deficiency theorem also tells us that any sufficiently nearby solution that starts in the same class will approach this equilibrium as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t+%5Cto+%5Cinfty&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="t &#92;to &#92;infty" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>This partially explains what we saw before in our graphs.  It shows that in the case <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha+%3D+%5Cbeta+%3D+1%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;alpha = &#92;beta = 1," class="latex" /> any solution that starts by <i>nearly</i> having</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B%5Cfrac%7Bx_1%5E2%7D%7Bx_2%7D+%3D+1%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{&#92;frac{x_1^2}{x_2} = 1} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>will actually have</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B%5Clim_%7Bt+%5Cto+%2B%5Cinfty%7D+%5Cfrac%7Bx_1%5E2%7D%7Bx_2%7D+%3D+1+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{&#92;lim_{t &#92;to +&#92;infty} &#92;frac{x_1^2}{x_2} = 1 }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>But in fact, in this example we don&#8217;t even need to start <i>near</i> the equilibrium for our solution to approach the equilibrium!  What about in general?  We don&#8217;t know, but just to get the ball rolling, we&#8217;ll risk the following wild guess:</p>
<p><b>Conjecture.</b>  If a reaction network has deficiency zero and is weakly reversible, and the rate constants are positive, the rate equation has exactly one equilibrium solution in each positive stoichiometric compatibility class, and <i>any</i> positive solution that starts in the same class will approach this equilibrium as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t+%5Cto+%2B%5Cinfty&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="t &#92;to +&#92;infty" class="latex" />. </p>
<p>If anyone knows a proof or counterexample, we&#8217;d be interested.  If this result were true, it would really clarify the dynamics of reaction networks in the zero deficiency case.</p>
<p>Next time we&#8217;ll talk about this same reaction network from a stochastic point of view, where we think of the atoms and molecules as reacting in a <i>probabilistic</i> way.  And we&#8217;ll see how the conservation laws we&#8217;ve been talking about today are related to <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/networks_11.html">Noether&#8217;s theorem for Markov processes</a>! </p>

<p>We&#8217;ve seen how Petri nets can be used to describe chemical reactions.  Indeed our <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/03/31/network-theory-part-2/">very first example</a> came from chemistry:</p>
<div align="center"><img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/chemistryNetBasicA.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>However, chemists rarely use the formalism of Petri nets.  They use a different but entirely equivalent formalism, called &#8216;reaction networks&#8217;.  So now we&#8217;d like to tell you about those. </p>
<p>You may wonder: why bother with another formalism, if it&#8217;s equivalent to the one we&#8217;ve already seen?   Well, one goal of this network theory program is to get people from different subjects to talk to each other&mdash;or at least be <i>able</i> to.  This requires setting up some dictionaries to translate between formalisms.  Furthermore, lots of deep results on stochastic Petri nets are being proved by chemists&mdash;but phrased in terms of reaction networks.  So you need to learn this other formalism to read their papers.  Finally, this other formalism is actually better in some ways!</p>
<p><b> Reaction networks </b> </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a reaction network:</p>
<div align="center"><img width="200" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/chemical_reaction_network_part_17_I.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>This network involves 5 <b>species</b>: that is, different kinds of things.  They could be atoms, molecules, ions or whatever: chemists call all of these <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_species">species</a>, and there&#8217;s no need to limit the applications to chemistry: in population biology, they could even be biological species!  We&#8217;re calling them A, B, C, D, and E, but in applications, we&#8217;d call them by specific names like CO<sub>2</sub> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup>, or &#8216;rabbit&#8217; and &#8216;wolf&#8217;, or whatever.</p>
<p>This network also involves 5 <b>reactions</b>, which are shown as arrows.  Each reaction turns one bunch of species into another.  So, written out more longwindedly, we&#8217;ve got these reactions:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+%5Cto+B&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A &#92;to B" class="latex" /> </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B+%5Cto+A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B &#92;to A" class="latex" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+%2B+C+%5Cto+D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A + C &#92;to D" class="latex" /> </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B+%2B+E+%5Cto+A+%2B+C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B + E &#92;to A + C" class="latex" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B+%2B+E+%5Cto+D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B + E &#92;to D" class="latex" />  </p>
<p>If you remember how Petri nets work, you can see how to translate any reaction network into a Petri net, or vice versa.  For example, the reaction network we&#8217;ve just seen gives this Petri net:</p>
<div align="center"><img width="350" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/petri_net_part_17_I.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>Each species corresponds to a <b>state</b> of this Petri net, drawn as a yellow circle.  And each reaction corresponds to <b>transition</b> of this Petri net, drawn as a blue square.  The arrows say how many things of each species appear as input or output to each transition.  There&#8217;s less explicit emphasis on complexes in the Petri net notation, but you can read them off if you want them.</p>
<p>In chemistry, a bunch of species is called a &#8216;complex&#8217;.  But what do I mean by &#8216;bunch&#8217;, exactly?  Well, I mean that in a given complex, each species can show up 0,1,2,3&#8230; or any natural number of times. So, we can formalize things like this:</p>
<p><b>Definition.</b>  Given a set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S" class="latex" /> of <b>species</b>, a <b>complex</b> of those species is a function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C%3A+S+%5Cto+%5Cmathbb%7BN%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C: S &#92;to &#92;mathbb{N}" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, a reaction network is a graph whose vertices are labelled by complexes.  Unfortunately, the word <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_%28mathematics%29">&#8216;graph&#8217;</a> means different things in mathematics&mdash;appallingly many things!  Everyone agrees that a graph has vertices and edges, but there are lots of choices about the details.  Most notably:</p>
<p>&bull; We can either put arrows on the edges, or not.</p>
<p>&bull;  We can either allow more than one edge between vertices, or not.</p>
<p>&bull;  We can either allow edges from a vertex to itself, or not.</p>
<p>If we say &#8216;no&#8217; in every case we get the concept of &#8216;simple graph&#8217;, which we discussed <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/11/04/network-theory-part-16/">last time</a>.  At the other extreme, if we say &#8216;yes&#8217; in every case we get the concept of &#8216;directed multigraph&#8217;, which is what we want now.  A bit more formally:</p>
<p><b>Definition.</b>  A <b>directed multigraph</b> consists of a set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="V" class="latex" /> of <b>vertices</b>, a set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="E" class="latex" /> of <b>edges</b>, and functions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s%2Ct%3A+E+%5Cto+V&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="s,t: E &#92;to V" class="latex" /> saying the <b>source</b> and <b>target</b> of each edge.</p>
<p>Given this, we can say:</p>
<p><b>Definition.</b>  A <b>reaction network</b> is a set of species together with a directed multigraph whose vertices are labelled by complexes of those species.</p>
<p>You can now prove that reaction networks are equivalent to Petri nets:</p>
<p><b>Puzzle 1.</b>  Show that any reaction network gives a <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/03/31/network-theory-part-2/">Petri net</a>, and vice versa.  </p>
<p>In a stochastic Petri net each transition is labelled by a <b>rate constant</b>: that is, a numbers in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5B0%2C%5Cinfty%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="[0,&#92;infty)" class="latex" />.  This lets us write down some differential equations saying how species turn into each other.  So, let&#8217;s make this definition (which is not standard, but will clarify things for us):</p>
<p><b>Definition.</b>  A <b>stochastic reaction network</b> is a reaction network where each reaction is labelled by a rate constant. </p>
<p>Now you can do this:</p>
<p><b>Puzzle 2.</b>  Show that any stochastic reaction network gives a <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/03/31/network-theory-part-2/">stochastic Petri net</a>, and vice versa.  </p>
<p>For extra credit, show that in each of these puzzles we actually get an equivalence of categories! For this you need to define morphisms between Petri nets, morphisms between reaction networks, and similarly for stochastic Petric nets and stochastic reaction networks.  If you get stuck, ask Eugene Lerman for advice.  There are different ways to define morphisms, but he knows a <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.5359">cool one</a>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been downplaying category theory so far, but it&#8217;s been lurking beneath everything we do, and someday it may rise to the surface.</p>
<h4> The deficiency zero theorem </h4>
<p>You may have already noticed one advantage of reaction networks over Petri nets: they&#8217;re quicker to draw.  This is true even for tiny examples.  For example, this reaction network:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2+X_1+%2B+X_2+%5Cleftrightarrow+2+X_3+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="2 X_1 + X_2 &#92;leftrightarrow 2 X_3 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>corresponds to this Petri net:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="300" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/bimolecular-reaction.png" alt="" />
</div>
<p>But there&#8217;s also a deeper advantage.  As we saw in <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/09/09/network-theory-part-8/">Part 8</a>, any stochastic Petri net gives two equations:</p>
<p>&bull; The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_equation"><b>master equation</b></a>, which says how the <i>probability that we have a given number of things of each species</i> changes with time.</p>
<p>&bull; The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_equation"><b>rate equation</b></a>, which says how the <i>expected number of things in each state</i> changes with time.   </p>
<p>The simplest solutions of these equations are the equilibrium solutions, where nothing depends on time. Back in <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/09/13/network-theory-part-9/">Part 9</a>, we explained when an equilibrium solution of the rate equation gives an equilibrium solution of the master equation.    But when is there an equilibrium solution of the rate equation in the first place?  </p>
<p>Feinberg&#8217;s &#8216;deficiency zero theorem&#8217; gives a handy sufficient condition.  And this condition is best stated using reaction networks!  But to understand it, we need to understand the &#8216;deficiency&#8217; of a reaction network.  So let&#8217;s define that, and they say what all the words in the definition mean:</p>
<p><b>Definition.</b>  The <b>deficiency</b> of a reaction network is:</p>
<p>&bull; the number of vertices </p>
<p>minus </p>
<p>&bull; the number of connected components</p>
<p>minus </p>
<p>&bull; the dimension of the stoichiometric subspace.  </p>
<p>The first two concepts here are easy.  A reaction network is a graph (okay, a directed multigraph).  So, it has some number of vertices, and also some number of connected components.  Two vertices lie in the same <b>connected component</b> iff you can get from one to the other by a path <i>where you don&#8217;t care which way the arrows point</i>.  For example, this reaction network:</p>
<div align="center"><img width="200" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/chemical_reaction_network_part_17_I.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>has 5 vertices and 2 connected components.  </p>
<p>So, what&#8217;s the &#8216;stoichiometric subspace&#8217;?  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoichiometry">&#8216;Stoichiometry&#8217;</a> is a scary-sounding word.  According to the Wikipedia article:</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8216;Stoichiometry&#8217; is derived from the Greek words στοιχεῖον (<i>stoicheion</i>, meaning element) and μέτρον (<i>metron</i>, meaning measure.) In patristic Greek, the word <i>Stoichiometria</i> was used by Nicephorus to refer to the number of line counts of the canonical New Testament and some of the Apocrypha.
</p></blockquote>
<p>But for us, stoichiometry is just the art of counting species.  To do this, we can form a vector space <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5ES&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}^S" class="latex" /> where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S" class="latex" /> is the set of species.  A vector in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5ES&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}^S" class="latex" /> is a function from species to real numbers, saying how much of each species is present.  Any complex gives a vector in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5ES&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}^S" class="latex" />, because it&#8217;s actually a function from species to <i>natural</i> numbers.  </p>
<p><b>Definition.</b>  The <b>stoichiometric subspace</b> of a reaction network is the subspace <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BStoch%7D+%5Csubseteq+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5ES&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{Stoch} &#92;subseteq &#92;mathbb{R}^S" class="latex" /> spanned by vectors of the form <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+-+y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x - y" class="latex" /> where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y" class="latex" /> are complexes connected by a reaction.</p>
<p>&#8216;Complexes connected by a reaction&#8217; makes sense because vertices in the reaction network are complexes, and edges are reactions.  Let&#8217;s see how it works in our example:</p>
<div align="center"><img width="200" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/chemical_reaction_network_part_17_I.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>Each complex here can be seen as a vector in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5ES&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}^S" class="latex" />, which is a vector space whose basis we can call <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%2C+B%2C+C%2C+D%2C+E&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A, B, C, D, E" class="latex" />.  Each reaction gives a difference of two vectors coming from complexes:</p>
<p>&bull; The reaction <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+%5Cto+B&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A &#92;to B" class="latex" /> gives the vector <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B+-+A.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B - A." class="latex" /></p>
<p>&bull; The reaction <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B+%5Cto+A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B &#92;to A" class="latex" /> gives the vector <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+-+B.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A - B." class="latex" /></p>
<p>&bull; The reaction <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+%2B+C+%5Cto+D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A + C &#92;to D" class="latex" /> gives the vector <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D+-+A+-+C.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="D - A - C." class="latex" /></p>
<p>&bull; The reaction <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B+%2B+E+%5Cto+A+%2B+C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B + E &#92;to A + C" class="latex" /> gives the vector <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+%2B+C+-+B+-+E.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A + C - B - E." class="latex" /></p>
<p>&bull; The reaction <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B+%2B+E+%5Cto+D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B + E &#92;to D" class="latex" /> gives the vector <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D+-+B+-+E.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="D - B - E." class="latex" /></p>
<p>The pattern is obvious, I hope.</p>
<p>These 5 vectors span the stoichiometric subspace.   But this subspace isn&#8217;t 5-dimensional, because these vectors are linearly dependent!  The first vector is the negative of the second one.  The last is the sum of the previous two.   And those are all the linear dependencies, so the stoichiometric subspace is 3 dimensional.  For example, it&#8217;s spanned by these 3 linearly independent vectors: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+-+B%2C+D+-+A+-+C%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A - B, D - A - C," class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D+-+B+-+E&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="D - B - E" class="latex" />.  </p>
<p>I hope you see the moral of this example: the stoichiometric subspace is the space of <i>ways to move in</i> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5ES&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}^S" class="latex" /> <i> that are allowed by the reactions in our reaction network!</i>   And this is important because the rate equation describes how the amount of each species changes as time passes.  So, it describes a point moving around in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5ES&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}^S" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>Thus, if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BStoch%7D+%5Csubseteq+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5ES&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{Stoch} &#92;subseteq &#92;mathbb{R}^S" class="latex" /> is the stoichiometric subspace, and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%28t%29+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5ES&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x(t) &#92;in &#92;mathbb{R}^S" class="latex" /> is a solution of the rate equation, then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%28t%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x(t)" class="latex" /> always stays within the set</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%280%29+%2B+%5Cmathrm%7BStoch%7D+%3D+%5C%7B+x%280%29+%2B+y+%5Ccolon+%5C%3B+y+%5Cin+%5Cmathrm%7BStoch%7D+%5C%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x(0) + &#92;mathrm{Stoch} = &#92;{ x(0) + y &#92;colon &#92;; y &#92;in &#92;mathrm{Stoch} &#92;} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Mathematicians would call this set the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coset">coset</a> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%280%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x(0)" class="latex" />, but chemists call it the <b>stoichiometric compatibility class</b> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%280%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x(0)." class="latex" /> </p>
<p>Anyway: what&#8217;s the deficiency of the reaction complex in our example?  It&#8217;s </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=5+-+2+-+3+%3D+0++&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="5 - 2 - 3 = 0  " class="latex" /></p>
<p>since there are 5 complexes, 2 connected components and the dimension of the stoichiometric subspace is 3.   </p>
<p>But what&#8217;s the deficiency zero theorem?  You&#8217;re almost ready for it.  You just need to know <i>one</i> more piece of jargon!  A reaction network is <b>weakly reversible</b> if whenever there&#8217;s a reaction going from a complex <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> to a complex <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y" class="latex" />, there&#8217;s a path of reactions going back from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" />.  Here the paths need to follow the arrows.</p>
<p>So, this reaction network is <i>not</i> weakly reversible:</p>
<div align="center"><img width="200" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/chemical_reaction_network_part_17_I.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>since we can get from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+%2B+C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A + C" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="D" class="latex" /> but not back from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="D" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+%2B+C%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A + C," class="latex" /> and from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B%2BE&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B+E" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="D" class="latex" /> but not back, and so on.  However, the network becomes weakly reversible if we add a reaction going back from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="D" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B+%2B+E&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B + E" class="latex" />:</p>
<div align="center"><img width="200" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/chemical_reaction_network_part_17_II.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>If a reaction network isn&#8217;t weakly reversible, one complex can  turn into another, but not vice versa.  In this situation, what typically happens is that as time goes on we have less and less of one species.  We could have an equilibrium where there&#8217;s <i>none</i> of this species.  But we have little right to expect an equilibrium solution of the rate equation that&#8217;s <b>positive</b>, meaning that it sits at a point <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%5Cin+%280%2C%5Cinfty%29%5ES&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x &#92;in (0,&#92;infty)^S" class="latex" />, where there&#8217;s a nonzero amount of every species.  </p>
<p>My argument here is not watertight: you&#8217;ll note that I fudged the difference between species and complexes.   But it can be made so when our reaction network has deficiency zero:</p>
<p><b>Deficiency Zero Theorem (Feinberg).</b>  Suppose we are given a reaction network with a finite set of species <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S" class="latex" />, and suppose its deficiency is zero.  Then: </p>
<p>(i) If the network is not weakly reversible and the rate constants are positive, the rate equation does not have a positive equilibrium solution.</p>
<p>(ii) If the network is not weakly reversible and the rate constants are positive, the rate equation does not have a positive periodic solution, that is, a periodic solution lying in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%280%2C%5Cinfty%29%5ES&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(0,&#92;infty)^S" class="latex" />. </p>
<p>(iii) If the network is weakly reversible and the rate constants are positive, the rate equation has exactly one equilibrium solution in each positive stoichiometric compatibility class.<br />
Any sufficiently nearby solution that starts in the same stoichiometric compatibility class will approach this equilibrium as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t+%5Cto+%2B%5Cinfty&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="t &#92;to +&#92;infty" class="latex" />.   Furthermore, there are no other positive periodic solutions.</p>
<p>This is quite an impressive result.  We&#8217;ll look at an easy example next time.</p>
<h4> References and remarks </h4>
<p>The deficiency zero theorem was published here:</p>
<p>&bull; Martin Feinberg, <a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~jadbabai/ESE680/Fei87a.pdf">Chemical reaction network structure and the stability of complex isothermal reactors: I. The deficiency zero and deficiency one theorems</a>, <i>Chemical Engineering Science</i> <b>42</b> (1987), 2229–2268. </p>
<p>These other explanations are also very helpful:</p>
<p>&bull; Martin Feinberg, <a href="http://www.che.eng.ohio-state.edu/~FEINBERG/LecturesOnReactionNetworks/">Lectures on reaction networks</a>, 1979.</p>
<p>&bull; Jeremy Gunawardena, <a href="http://vcp.med.harvard.edu/papers/crnt.pdf">Chemical reaction network theory for in-silico biologists</a>, 2003.</p>
<p>At first glance the deficiency zero theorem might seem to settle all the basic questions about the dynamics of reaction networks, or stochastic Petri nets&#8230; but actually, it just means that deficiency zero reaction networks don&#8217;t display very interesting dynamics in the limit as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t+%5Cto+%2B%5Cinfty.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="t &#92;to +&#92;infty." class="latex" />  So, to get more interesting behavior, we need to look at reaction networks that don&#8217;t have deficiency zero.  </p>
<p>For example, in biology it&#8217;s interesting to think about &#8216;bistable&#8217; chemical reactions: reactions that have two stable equilibria.  An electrical switch of the usual sort is a bistable system: it has stable &#8216;on&#8217; and &#8216;off&#8217; positions.  A bistable chemical reaction can serve as a kind of biological switch:</p>
<p>&bull; Gheorghe Craciun, Yangzhong Tang and Martin Feinberg, <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/103/23/8697.abstract">Understanding bistability in complex enzyme-driven reaction networks</a>, <i><a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/108/11/4281.abstract">PNAS</a></i> <b>103</b> (2006), 8697-8702.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also interesting to think about chemical reactions with stable periodic solutions.  Such a reaction can serve as a biological clock:</p>
