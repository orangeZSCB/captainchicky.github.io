					<p>We saw <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/10/22/mathematics-of-the-environment-part-4/">last time</a> that the Earth&#8217;s temperature seems to have been getting colder but also more erratic for the last 30 million years or so.  Here&#8217;s the last 5 million again:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://www.globalwarmingart.com/wiki/File:Five_Myr_Climate_Change_Rev_png"><img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature/5Myr.png" /></a></div>
<p>People think these glacial cycles are due to variations in the Earth&#8217;s orbit, but as we&#8217;ll see later, those cause quite small changes in &#8216;insolation&#8217;&#8212;roughly, the amount of sunshine hitting the Earth (as a function of time and location).   So, M. I. Budyko, an expert on the glacial cycles, wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Thus, the present thermal regime and glaciations of the Earth prove to be characterized by high instability. Comparatively small changes of radiation—only by 1.0-1.5%—are sufficient for the development of ice cover on the land and oceans that reaches temperate latitudes.
</p></blockquote>
<p>How can small changes in the amount of sunlight hitting the Earth, or other parameters, create big changes in the Earth&#8217;s temperature?   The obvious answer is <i>positive feedback</i>: some sort of amplifying effect.  </p>
<p>But what could it be?  Do we know feedback mechanisms that can amplify small changes in temperature?  Yes.  Here are a few obvious ones:</p>
<p>&bull; <b><a href="http://geotest.tamu.edu/userfiles/216/dessler09.pdf">Water vapor feedback</a></b>.  When it gets warmer, more water evaporates, and the air becomes more humid. But water vapor is a greenhouse gas, which causes additional warming.  Conversely, when the Earth cools down, the air becomes drier, so the greenhouse effect becomes weaker, which tends to cool things down.</p>
<p>&bull; <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice-albedo_feedback">Ice albedo feedback</a>.</b>  Snow and ice reflect more light than liquid oceans or soil.  When the Earth warms up, snow and ice melt, so the Earth becomes darker, absorbs more light, and tends to get get even warmer.  Conversely, when the Earth cools down, more snow and ice form, so the Earth becomes lighter, absorbs less light, and tends to get even cooler.</p>
<p>&bull; <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_feedback#CO2_in_the_oceans">Carbon dioxide solubility feedback</a>.</b>  Cold water can hold more carbon dioxide than warm water: that&#8217;s why opening a warm can of soda can be so explosive.  So, when the Earth&#8217;s oceans warm up, they release carbon dioxide.  But carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, which causes additional warming.  Conversely, when the oceaans cool down, they absorb more carbon dioxide, so the greenhouse effect becomes weaker, which tends to cool things down.</p>
<p>Of course, there are also negative feedbacks: otherwise the climate would be utterly unstable!  There are also complicated feedbacks whose overall effect is harder to evaluate:</p>
<p>&bull; <b>Planck feedback.</b>  A hotter world radiates more heat, which cools it down.  This is the big negative feedback that keeps all the positive feedbacks from making the Earth insanely hot or insanely cold.</p>
<p>&bull; <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_feedback">Cloud feedback</a>.</b> A warmer Earth has more clouds, which reflect more light but also increase the greenhouse effect. </p>
<p>&bull; <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_feedback#Lapse_rate">Lapse rate feedback</a>.</b>   An increased greenhouse effect changes the vertical temperature profile of the atmosphere, which has effects of its own&mdash;but this works differently near the poles and near the equator.    </p>
<p>See also <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week302.html">&#8220;week302&#8221;</a> of <i>This Week&#8217;s Finds</i>, where <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Nathan+Urban">Nathan Urban</a> tells us more about feedbacks and how big they&#8217;re likely to be.  </p>
<p>Understanding all these feedbacks, and which ones are important for the glacial cycles we see, is a complicated business.  Instead of diving straight into this, let&#8217;s try something much simpler.  Let&#8217;s just think about how the ice albedo effect could, in theory, make the Earth bistable.</p>
<p>To do this, let&#8217;s look at the very simplest model in this great not-yet-published book:</p>
<p>&bull; Gerald R. North, <i>Simple Models of Global Climate</i>.</p>
<p>This is a <b>zero-dimensional energy balance model</b>, meaning that it only involves the average temperature of the earth, the average solar radiation coming in, and the average infrared radiation going out.</p>
<p>The average temperature will be <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T," class="latex" /> measured in Celsius.  We&#8217;ll assume the Earth radiates power square meter equal to</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+A+%2B+B+T+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ A + B T }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+%3D+218&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A = 218" class="latex" /> watts/meter<sup>2</sup> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B+%3D+1.90&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B = 1.90" class="latex" /> watts/meter<sup>2</sup> per degree Celsius.  This is a linear approximation taken from satellite data on our Earth.  In reality, the power emitted grows faster than linearly with temperature.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll assume the Earth absorbs solar energy power per square meter equal to</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q+c%28T%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Q c(T) " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Here:</p>
<p>&bull; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Q" class="latex" /> is the average <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insolation">insolation</a></b>: that is, the amount of solar power per square meter hitting the top of the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere, averaged over location and time of year. In reality <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Q" class="latex" /> is about 341.5 watts/meter<sup>2</sup>.  This is one quarter of the <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Solar%20radiation"><b>solar constant</b></a>, meaning the solar power per square meter that would hit a panel hovering in space above the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere and facing directly at the Sun.  (Why a quarter?  We&#8217;ve seen why: it&#8217;s because the area of a sphere is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=4+%5Cpi+r%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="4 &#92;pi r^2" class="latex" /> while the area of a circle is just <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi+r%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;pi r^2" class="latex" />.)</p>
<p>&bull; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%28T%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c(T)" class="latex" /> is the <b>coalbedo</b>: the fraction of solar power that gets absorbed.  The coalbedo depends on the temperature; we&#8217;ll have to say how.</p>
<p>Given all this, we get</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+C+%5Cfrac%7Bd+T%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D+-+A+-+B+T+%2B+Q+c%28T%28t%29%29+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ C &#92;frac{d T}{d t} = - A - B T + Q c(T(t)) }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C" class="latex" /> is Earth&#8217;s heat capacity in joules per degree per square meter.  Of course this is a funny thing, because heat energy is stored not only at the surface but also in the air and/or water, and the details vary a lot depending on where we are.  But if we consider a uniform planet with dry air and no ocean, North says we may roughly take <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C" class="latex" /> equal to about half the heat capacity at constant pressure of the column of dry air over a square meter, namely 5 million joules per degree Celsius.</p>
<p>The easiest thing to do is find equilibrium solutions, meaning solutions where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7Bd+T%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D+0%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;frac{d T}{d t} = 0," class="latex" /> so that</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+%2B+B+T+%3D+Q+c%28T%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A + B T = Q c(T) " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Now <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C" class="latex" /> doesn&#8217;t matter anymore!  We&#8217;d like to solve for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T" class="latex" /> as a function of the insolation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Q," class="latex" /> but it&#8217;s easier to solve for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Q" class="latex" /> as a function of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T" class="latex" />:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+Q+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B+A+%2B+B+T+%7D+%7Bc%28T%29%7D+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ Q = &#92;frac{ A + B T } {c(T)} }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>To go further, we need to guess some formula for the coalbedo <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%28T%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c(T)." class="latex" /> The coalbedo, remember, is the fraction of sunlight that gets absorbed when it hits the Earth.  It&#8217;s 1 minus the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo"><b>albedo</b></a>, which is the fraction that gets reflected.  Here&#8217;s a little chart of albedos:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Albedo-e_hg.svg/429px-Albedo-e_hg.svg.png" /></a></div>
<p>If you get mixed up between albedo and coalbedo, just remember: coal has a high coalbedo.</p>
<p>Since we&#8217;re trying to keep things very simple right not, <i>not</i> model nature in all its glorious complexity, let&#8217;s just say the average albedo of the Earth is 0.65 when it&#8217;s very cold and there&#8217;s lots of snow.  So, let</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_i+%3D+1++-+0.65+%3D++0.35+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c_i = 1  - 0.65 =  0.35 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>be the &#8216;<b>i</b>cy&#8217; coalbedo, good for very low temperatures.  Similarly, let&#8217;s say the average albedo drops to 0.3 when its very hot and the Earth is darker.  So, let </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_f+%3D+1+-+0.3+%3D+0.7+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c_f = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>be the &#8216;ice-<b>f</b>ree&#8217; coalbedo, good for high temperatures when the Earth is darker.  </p>
<p>Then, we need a function of temperature that interpolates between <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c_i" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_f.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c_f." class="latex" />  Let&#8217;s try this:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%28T%29+%3D+c_i+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D+%28c_f-c_i%29+%281+%2B+%5Ctanh%28%5Cgamma+T%29%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c(T) = c_i + &#92;frac{1}{2} (c_f-c_i) (1 + &#92;tanh(&#92;gamma T)) " class="latex" /></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not a fan of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_function">hyperbolic tangent</a> function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctanh%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;tanh," class="latex" /> this may seem scary.  But don&#8217;t be intimidated!</p>
<p>The function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%281+%2B+%5Ctanh%28%5Cgamma+T%29%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;frac{1}{2}(1 + &#92;tanh(&#92;gamma T)) " class="latex" /> is just a function that goes smoothly from 0 at low temperatures to 1 at high temperatures.  This ensures that the coalbedo is near its icy value <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c_i" class="latex" /> at low temperatures, and near its ice-free value <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c_f" class="latex" /> at high temperatures.  But the fun part here is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;gamma," class="latex" /> a parameter that says how rapidly the coalbedo rises as the Earth gets warmer.  Depending on this, we&#8217;ll get different effects!</p>
<p>The function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%28T%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c(T)" class="latex" /> rises fastest at <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T+%3D+0%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T = 0," class="latex" /> since that&#8217;s where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctanh+%28%5Cgamma+T%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;tanh (&#92;gamma T)" class="latex" /> has the biggest slope.  We&#8217;re just lucky that in Celsius <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T+%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T = 0" class="latex" /> is the melting point of ice, so this makes a bit of sense.</p>
<p>Now <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Allan+Erskine">Allan Erskine</a>&#8216;s programming magic comes into play!  I&#8217;m very fortunate that the Azimuth Project has attracted some programmers who can make nice software for me to show you.  Unfortunately his software doesn&#8217;t work on this blog&mdash;yet!&mdash;so please hop over here to see it in action:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/coalbedo/coalbedo_new.html">Temperature versus insolation</a>.</p>
<p>You can slide a slider to adjust the parameter <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;gamma" class="latex" /> to various values between 0 and 1.  </p>
<p>In the little graph at right, you can see how the coalbedo <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%28T%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c(T)" class="latex" /> changes as a function of the temperature <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T." class="latex" /> In this graph the temperature ranges from -50 &deg;C and 50 &deg;C; the graph depends on what value of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;gamma" class="latex" /> you choose with slider.</p>
<p>In the big graph at left, you can see how the insolation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Q" class="latex" /> required to yield a given temperature <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T" class="latex" /> between -50 &deg;C and 50 &deg;C.   As we&#8217;ve seen, it&#8217;s easiest to graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Q" class="latex" /> as a function of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T%3A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T:" class="latex" /> </p>

<p>Solving for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T" class="latex" /> here is hard, but we can just flip the graph over to see what equilibrium temperatures <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T" class="latex" /> are allowed for a given insolation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Q" class="latex" /> between 200 and 500 watts per square mater.</p>
<p>The exciting thing is that when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;gamma" class="latex" /> gets big enough, <i>three different temperatures are compatible with the same amount of insolation!</i>  This means the Earth can be hot, cold or something intermediate even when the amount of sunlight hitting it is fixed.  The intermediate state is unstable, it turns out&#8212;we&#8217;ll see why later.  Only the hot and cold states are stable.  So, we say the Earth is <b>bistable</b> in this simplified model.</p>
<p>Can you see how big <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;gamma" class="latex" /> needs to be for this bistability to kick in?  It&#8217;s certainly there when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma+%3D+0.05%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;gamma = 0.05," class="latex" /> since then we get a graph like this:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week319_temperature_versus_insolation.jpg" />
</div>
<p>When the insolation is less than about 385 W/m<sup>2</sup> there&#8217;s only a cold state.  When it hits 385 W/m<sup>2</sup>, as shown by the <font color="green"><b>green line</b></font>, suddenly there are two possible temperatures: a cold one and a much hotter one.  When the insolation is higher, as shown by the <b>black line</b>, there are three possible temperatures: a cold one, and unstable intermediate one, and a hot one.  And when the insolation gets above 465 W/m<sup>2</sup>, as shown by the <font color="red"><b>red line</b></font>, there&#8217;s only a hot state! </p>
<p>Mathematically, this model illustrates catastrophe theory.  As we slowly turn up <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;gamma," class="latex" /> we get different curves showing how temperature is a function of insolation&#8230; until suddenly the curve isn&#8217;t the graph of a function anymore: it becomes infinitely steep at one point!  After that, we get bistability:</p>

<p>This is called a <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catastrophe_theory#Cusp_catastrophe">cusp catastrophe</a></b>, and you can visualize these curves as slices of a surface in 3d, which looks roughly like this picture:</p>

</div>
<p>from here:</p>
<p>&bull; Wolfram Mathworld, <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CuspCatastrophe.html">Cusp catastrophe</a>.  (Includes Mathematica package.)</p>
<p>The cusp catastrophe is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_stability">&#8216;structurally stable&#8217;</a>, meaning that small perturbations don&#8217;t change its qualitative behavior.  In other words, <i>whenever</i> you have a smooth graph of a function that gets steeper and steeper until it &#8216;overhangs&#8217; and ceases to be the graph of a function, it looks like this cusp catastrophe.   This statement is quite vague as I&#8217;ve just said it&#8212; but it&#8217;s made 100% precise in catastrophe theory.  </p>
<p>Structural stability is a useful concept, because it focuses our attention on <i>robust</i> features of models: features that don&#8217;t go away if the model is slightly wrong, as it always is.</p>
<p>There are lots more things to say, but the most urgent question to answer is this: why is the intermediate state unstable when it exists?  Why are the other two equilibria stable?  We&#8217;ll talk about that next time!</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>In parts 2-24 of this <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/">network theory series</a>, we&#8217;ve been talking about Petri nets and reaction networks.   These parts are now getting turned into a book.  You can see a draft here:</p>
<p>&bull; John Baez and Jacob Biamonte, <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/stoch_stable.pdf">A course on quantum techniques for stochastic mechanics</a>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot more to network theory than this.  But before I dive into the next big topic, I want to mention a few more odds and ends about Petri nets and reaction networks.   For example, their connection to logic and computation!</p>
<p>As we&#8217;ve seen, a stochastic Petri net can be used to describe a bunch of chemical reactions with certain reaction rates.  We could try to use these reactions to build a &#8216;chemical computer&#8217;.   But <i>how powerful can such a computer be?</i></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know the answer.  But before people got interested in <i>stochastic</i> Petri nets, computer scientists spent quite some time studying plain old Petri nets, which don&#8217;t include the information about reaction rates.  They used these as simple models of computation.  And since computer scientists like to know which questions are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decidability_%28logic%29">decidable</a> by means of an algorithm and which aren&#8217;t, they proved some interesting theorems about decidability for Petri nets.  </p>
<p>Let me talk about: &#8216;reachability&#8217;: the question of which collections of molecules can turn into which other collections, given a fixed set of chemical reactions.   For example, suppose you have these chemical reactions:</p>
<div align="center">
<p>C + O<sub>2</sub> &rarr; CO<sub>2</sub></p>
<p>CO<sub>2</sub> + NaOH &rarr; NaHCO<sub>3</sub></p>
<p>NaHCO<sub>3</sub> + HCl &rarr; H<sub>2</sub>O + NaCl + CO<sub>2</sub>
</div>
<p>Can you use these to turn</p>
<div align="center">
C + O<sub>2</sub> + NaOH + HCl
</div>
<p>into </p>
<div align="center">
CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O + NaCl ?
</div>
<p>It&#8217;s not too hard to settle this particular question&#8212;we&#8217;ll do it soon.  But settling <i>all possible</i> such questions turns out to be very hard</p>
<h3> Reachability </h3>
<p>Remember: </p>
<p><b>Definition.</b> A <b>Petri net</b> consists of a set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S" class="latex" /> of <b>species</b> and a set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T" class="latex" /> of <b>transitions</b>, together with a function </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i+%3A+S+%5Ctimes+T+%5Cto+%5Cmathbb%7BN%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i : S &#92;times T &#92;to &#92;mathbb{N} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>saying how many copies of each state shows up as <b>input</b> for each transition, and a function</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=o%3A+S+%5Ctimes+T+%5Cto+%5Cmathbb%7BN%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="o: S &#92;times T &#92;to &#92;mathbb{N}" class="latex" /></p>
<p>saying how many times it shows up as <b>output</b>.   </p>
<p>Today we&#8217;ll assume both <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T" class="latex" /> are finite.</p>
<p>Jacob and I like to draw the species as yellow circles and the transitions as aqua boxes, in a charmingly garish color scheme chosen by Dave Tweed.   So, the chemical reactions I mentioned before:</p>
<div align="center">
<p>C + O<sub>2</sub> &rarr; CO<sub>2</sub></p>
<p>CO<sub>2</sub> + NaOH &rarr; NaHCO<sub>3</sub></p>
<p>NaHCO<sub>3</sub> + HCl &rarr; H<sub>2</sub>O + NaCl + CO<sub>2</sub>
</div>
<p>give this Petri net:</p>
<div align="center"><img width="400" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/chemistryNetBasicA.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>A &#8216;complex&#8217; is, roughly, a way of putting dots in the yellow circles.   In chemistry this says how many molecules we have of each kind.  Here&#8217;s an example:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="400" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/files/chemistryNetDot1A.png" alt="" />
</div>
<p>This complex happens to have just zero or one dot in each circle, but that&#8217;s not required: we could have any number of dots in each circle.  So, mathematically, a <b>complex</b> is a finite linear combination of species, with natural numbers as coefficients.  In other words, it&#8217;s an element of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BN%7D%5ES.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{N}^S." class="latex" />   In this particular example it&#8217;s</p>
<div align="center">
C + O<sub>2</sub> + NaOH + HCl
</div>
<p>Given two complexes, we say one is <b>reachable</b> from another if, loosely speaking, we can get to it from the other by a finite sequence of transitions.  For example, earlier on I asked if we can get from the complex I just mentioned to the complex</p>
<div align="center">
CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O + NaCl
</div>
<p>which we can draw like this:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="300" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/files/chemistryNetDot4.png" alt="" />
</div>
<p>And the answer is yes, we can do it with this sequence of transitions:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="300" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/files/chemistryNetDot1A.png" alt="" />
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="300" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/files/chemistryNetDot2A.png" alt="" />
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div align="center">

<div align="center">
<img width="300" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/files/chemistryNetDot4.png" alt="" />
</div>
<p>This settles the question I asked earlier.</p>
<p>So in chemistry, reachability is all about whether it&#8217;s possible to use certain chemical reactions to turn one collection of molecules into another using a certain set of reactions.  I hope this is clear enough; I could formalize it further but it seems unnecessary.  If you have questions, ask me or read this:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petri_net#Execution_semantics">Petri net: execution semantics</a>, Wikipedia.</p>
<h3> The reachability problem </h3>
<p>Now the <b>reachability problem</b> asks: given a Petri net and two complexes, is one reachable from the other?  </p>
<p>If the answer is &#8216;yes&#8217;, of course you can show that by an exhaustive search of all possibilities.  But if the answer is &#8216;no&#8217;, how can you be sure?  It&#8217;s not obvious, in general.  Back in the 1970&#8217;s, computer scientists felt this problem should be decidable by some algorithm&#8230; but they had a lot of trouble finding such an algorithm.  </p>
<p>In 1976, <a href="rjlipton.wordpress.com">Richard J. Lipton</a> showed that if such an algorithm existed, it would need to take at least an exponential amount of memory space and an exponential amount of time to run:</p>
<p>&bull; Richard J. Lipton, <a href="http://www.cs.yale.edu/publications/techreports/tr63.pdf">The reachability problem requires exponential space</a>, Technical Report 62, Yale University, 1976.</p>
<p>This means that most computer scientists would consider any algorithm to solve the reachability problem &#8216;infeasible&#8217;, since they like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity#Polynomial_time">polynomial time</a> algorithms.  </p>
<p>On the bright side, it means that Petri nets might be fairly powerful when viewed as computers themselves! After all, for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Turing_machine">universal Turing machine</a>, the analogue of the reachability problem is undecidable.  So if the reachability problem for Petri nets were decidable, they couldn&#8217;t be universal computers.  But if it were decidable but hard, Petri nets might be fairly powerful&#8212;though still not universal&#8212;computers.</p>
<p>In 1977, at the ACM Symposium on the Theory of Computing, two researchers presented a proof that reachability problem was decidable:</p>
<p>&bull; S. Sacerdote and R. Tenney, The decidability of the reachability problem for vector addition systems, <i>Conference Record of the Ninth Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, 2-4 May 1977, Boulder, Colorado, USA</i>, ACM, 1977, pp. 61&#8211;76.</p>
<p>However, it turned out to be flawed!  I read about this episode here:</p>
<p>&bull; James L. Peterson, <i>Petri Net Theory and the Modeling of Systems</i>, Prentice&#8211;Hall, New Jersey, 1981.</p>
<p>This is a very nice introduction to early work on Petri nets and decidability.   Peterson had an interesting idea, too:</p>
<blockquote><p>
There would seem to be a very useful connection between Petri nets and Presburger arithmetic.
</p></blockquote>
<p>He gave some evidence, and suggested using this to settle the decidability of the reachability problem.   I found that intriguing!  Let me explain why.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presburger_arithmetic">Presburger arithmetic</a> is a simple set of axioms for the arithmetic of natural numbers, much weaker than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_arithmetic">Peano arithmetic</a> or even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robinson_arithmetic">Robinson arithmetic</a>.  Unlike those other systems, Presburger arithmetic doesn&#8217;t mention multiplication.  And unlike those other systems, you can write an algorithm that decides whether any given statement in Presburger arithmetic is provable.  </p>
<p>However, any such algorithm must be very slow!   In 1974, Fischer and Rabin showed that any decision algorithm for Presburger arithmetic has a worst-case runtime of at least </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B2%5E%7Bc+n%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="2^{2^{c n}}" class="latex" /> </p>
<p>for some constant <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c," class="latex" /> where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" /> is the length of the statement.   So we say the complexity is at least doubly exponential.  That&#8217;s much worse than exponential!    On the other hand, an algorithm with a <i>triply</i> exponential run time was found by Oppen in 1978.   </p>
<p>I hope you see why this is intriguing.  Provability is a lot like reachability, since in a proof you&#8217;re trying to reach the conclusion starting from the assumptions using certain rules.  Like Presburger arithmetic, Petri nets are all about addition, since they consists of transitions going between linear combinations like this:</p>
<div align="center">
6 CO<sub>2</sub> + 6 H<sub>2</sub>O &rarr; C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + 6 O<sub>2</sub>
</div>
<p>That&#8217;s why the old literature calls Petri nets <b>vector addition systems</b>.   And finally, the difficulty of deciding provability in Presburger arithmetic smells a bit like the difficulty of deciding reachability in Petri nets.</p>
<p>So, I was eager to learn what happened after Peterson wrote his book.</p>
<p>For starters, in 1981, the very year Peterson&#8217;s book came out, Ernst Mayr showed that the reachability problem for Petri nets <i>is</i> decidable:</p>
<p>&bull; Ernst Mayr, Persistence of vector replacement systems is decidable, <i><a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/w0106k6624406366/?MUD=MP">Acta Informatica</a></i> <b>15</b> (1981), 309&#8211;318.</p>
<p>As you can see from the title, Mayr actually proved some other property was decidable.  However, it follows that reachability is decidable, and Mayr pointed this out in his paper.  In fact the decidability of reachability for Petri nets is equivalent to lots of other interesting questions.  You can see a bunch here:</p>
<p>&bull; Javier Esparza and Mogens Nielsen, <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=5EBA38B02179E955EB84DCA21345710C?doi=10.1.1.2.3965&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Decidability issues for Petri nets&#8212;a survey</a>, <i>Bulletin of the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science</i> <b>52</b> (1994), 245&#8211;262.</p>
<p>Mayr&#8217;s algorithm was complicated.  Worse still, it seems to take a hugely long time to run.  It seems nobody knows an explicit bound on its runtime.  The runtim might even grow faster than any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_recursive_function">primitive recursive</a> function.  The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackermann_function">Ackermann function</a> and the closely related <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackermann_function#Ackermann_numbers">Ackermann numbers</a> are famous examples of functions that grow more rapidly than any primitive recursive function.  If you don&#8217;t know about these, now is the time to learn!</p>
<p>Remember that we can define multiplication by iterating addition:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%5Ctimes+m+%3D+n+%2B+n+%2B+n+%2B+%5Ccdots+%2B+n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n &#92;times m = n + n + n + &#92;cdots + n" class="latex" /></p>
<p>where add <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" /> to itself <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="m" class="latex" /> times.  Then we can define exponentiation by iterating multiplication:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%5Cuparrow+m+%3D+n+%5Ctimes+n+%5Ctimes+n+%5Ctimes+%5Ccdots+%5Ctimes+n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n &#92;uparrow m = n &#92;times n &#92;times n &#92;times &#92;cdots &#92;times n" class="latex" /></p>
<p>where we multiply <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" /> by itself <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="m" class="latex" /> times.  Here I&#8217;m using Knuth&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_up-arrow_notation">up-arrow notation</a>.  Then we can define <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetration">tetration</a> by iterating exponentiation:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%5Cuparrow%5E2+m+%3D+n+%5Cuparrow+%28n+%5Cuparrow+%28n+%5Cuparrow+%5Ccdots+%5Cuparrow+n%29%29%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n &#92;uparrow^2 m = n &#92;uparrow (n &#92;uparrow (n &#92;uparrow &#92;cdots &#92;uparrow n)))" class="latex" /></p>
<p>Then we can define an operation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cuparrow%5E3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;uparrow^3" class="latex" /> by iterating tetration, and so on.  All these functions are primitive recursive.  But the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" />th <b>Ackermann number</b> is not; it&#8217;s defined to be</p>

<p>This grows at an <i>insanely</i> rapid rate:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1+%5Cuparrow+1+%3D+1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="1 &#92;uparrow 1 = 1" class="latex" /></p>

<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3+%5Cuparrow%5E3+3+%3D+3%5E%7B3%5E%7B3%5E%7B.%5E%7B.%5E%7B.%7D%7D%7D%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="3 &#92;uparrow^3 3 = 3^{3^{3^{.^{.^{.}}}}}" class="latex" /></p>
<p>where we have a stack of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3%5E%7B3%5E3%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="3^{3^3}" class="latex" /> threes&#8212;or in other words, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3%5E%7B7625597484987%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="3^{7625597484987}" class="latex" /> threes!  When we get to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=4+%5Cuparrow%5E4+4%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="4 &#92;uparrow^4 4," class="latex" /> my mind boggles.  I wish it didn&#8217;t, but it does.</p>
<p>In 1998 someone came up with a faster algorithm: </p>
<p>&bull; Zakaria Bouziane, <a href="http://hal.inria.fr/inria-00073286/PDF/RR-3404.pdf">A primitive recursive algorithm for the general Petri net reachability problem</a>, in <i>39th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science</i>, IEEE, 1998, pp. 130-136.</p>
<p>Bouziane claimed this algorithm is doubly exponential in space and time.  That&#8217;s very slow, but not <i>insanely</i> slow.</p>
<p>However, it seems that Bouziane made a mistake:</p>
<p>&bull; Petr Jančar, Bouziane’s transformation of the Petri net reachability problem and incorrectness of the related algorithm, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ic.2008.06.003" rel="nofollow"><i>Information and Computation</i></a>, <b>206</b> (2008), 1259&#8211;1263.</p>
<p>So: if I tell you some chemicals and a bunch of reactions involving these chemicals, you can decide when some combination of these chemicals can turn into another combination.  But it may take a long time to decide this.  And we don&#8217;t know exactly how long: just more than &#8216;exponentially long&#8217;!</p>
<p>What about the connection to Presburger arithmetic?  This title suggests that it exists:</p>
<p>&bull; J&eacute;rôme Leroux, <a href="http://hal.inria.fr/docs/00/31/93/93/PDF/main.pdf">The general vector addition system reachability problem by Presburger inductive separators</a>, 2008.</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t understand the paper well enough to be sure.  Can someone say more?  </p>
<p>Also, does anyone know more about the computational power of Petri nets?  They&#8217;re not universal computers, but is there a good way to say how powerful they are?  Does the fact that it takes a long time to settle the reachability question really imply that they have a lot of computational power?  </p>
<h3> Symmetric monoidal categories </h3>
<p>Next let me explain the secret reason I&#8217;m so fascinated by this.  This section is mainly for people who like category theory.</p>
<p>As I mentioned once before, a Petri net is actually nothing but a presentation of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braided_monoidal_category#Symmetric_monoidal_categories">symmetric monoidal category</a> that&#8217;s free on some set of objects and some set of morphisms going between tensor products of those objects:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/vs">Vladimiro Sassone</a>, <a href="http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/11951/1/strong-conf.pdf">On the category of Petri net computations</a>, <i>6th International Conference on Theory and Practice of Software Development</i>, Proceedings of TAPSOFT &#8217;95, Lecture Notes in Computer Science <b>915</b>, Springer, Berlin, pp. 334-348.</p>
<p>In chemistry we write the tensor product additively, but we could also write it as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cotimes&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;otimes" class="latex" />.  Then the reachability problem consists of questions of this general type:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Suppose we have a symmetric monoidal category freely generated by objects <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%2C+B%2C+C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A, B, C" class="latex" /> and morphisms</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e%3A+A+%5Cto+B+%5Cotimes+C+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="e: A &#92;to B &#92;otimes C " class="latex" /> </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%3A+A+%5Cotimes+A+%5Cotimes+B+%5Cto+A+%5Cotimes+C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f: A &#92;otimes A &#92;otimes B &#92;to A &#92;otimes C" class="latex" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g%3A+A+%5Cotimes+B+%5Cotimes+C+%5Cto+A+%5Cotimes+B+%5Cotimes+B&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="g: A &#92;otimes B &#92;otimes C &#92;to A &#92;otimes B &#92;otimes B" class="latex" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h+%3A+B+%5Cotimes+A+%5Cotimes+A+%5Cto+B&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="h : B &#92;otimes A &#92;otimes A &#92;to B" class="latex" /></p>
<p>Is there a morphism from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B+%5Cotimes+A+%5Cotimes+A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B &#92;otimes A &#92;otimes A" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+%5Cotimes+A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A &#92;otimes A" class="latex" />?
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is reminiscent of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_problem_for_groups">word problem for groups</a> and other problems where we are given a presentation of an algebraic structure and have to decide if two elements are equal&#8230; but now, instead of asking whether two elements are equal we are asking if there is a morphism from one object to another.  So, it is fascinating that this problem is decidable&#8212;unlike the word problem for groups&#8212;but still very hard to decide.</p>
<p>Just in case you want to see a more formal statement, let me finish off by giving you that:</p>
<p><b>Reachability problem.</b>  Given a symmetric monoidal category <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C" class="latex" /> freely generated by a finite set of objects and a finite set of morphisms between tensor products of these objects, and given two objects <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2Cy+%5Cin+C%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x,y &#92;in C," class="latex" /> is there a morphism <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%3A+x+%5Cto+y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f: x &#92;to y" class="latex" />?  </p>
<p><b>Theorem (Lipton,  Mayr).</b>  There is an algorithm that decides the reachability problem.  However, for any such algorithm, for any <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+%3E+0%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c &gt; 0," class="latex" /> the worst-case run-time exceeds <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7Bc+n%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="2^{c n}" class="latex" /> where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" /> is the size of the problem: the sum of the number of generating objects, the number of factors in the sources and targets of all the generating morphisms, and the number of factors in the objects <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2Cy+%5Cin+C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x,y &#92;in C" class="latex" /> for which the reachability problem is posed.  </p>

<b>Abstract:</b> The International Mathematical Union has declared 2013 to be the year of <a href="http://mpe2013.org/">The Mathematics of Planet Earth</a>.  The global warming crisis is part of a bigger transformation in which humanity realizes that the Earth is a finite system and that our population, energy usage, and the like cannot continue to grow exponentially.  If civilization survives this transformation, it will affect mathematics&#8212;and be affected by it&#8212;just as dramatically as the agricultural revolution or industrial revolution.  We cannot know for sure what the effect will be, but we can already make some guesses.  </p></blockquote>

				<small>22 October, 2012</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>We&#8217;ve <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/10/13/mathematics-of-the-environment-part-3/">been looking</a> at some very simple models of the Earth&#8217;s climate.  Pretty soon I want to show you one that illustrates the <b>ice albedo effect</b>.  This effect says that when it&#8217;s colder, there&#8217;s more ice and snow, so the Earth gets lighter in color, so it reflects more sunlight and tends to get even colder.  In other words, it&#8217;s a <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_feedback">positive feedback</a></b> mechanism: a reaction that strengthens the process that caused the reaction. </p>
<p>Since a higher temperature leads to a higher radiation and therefore to cooling, and a lower temperature leads to a lower radiation, according to the Planck distribution, there is always also a <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_feedback">negative feedback</a></b> present in the climate system of the earth. This is dubbed the <b>Planck feedback</b>, and this is what ultimately protects the Earth against getting arbitrarily hot or cold.</p>
<p>However, the ice albedo effect may be important for the &#8216;ice ages&#8217; or more properly &#8216;glacial cycles&#8217; that we&#8217;ve been having for the last few ten million years&#8230; and also for much earlier, much colder <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowball_Earth">Snowball Earth</a> events.  In reverse, melting ice now tends to make the Earth darker and even warmer.  So, this is an interesting topic for many reasons&#8230; including the math, which we&#8217;ll get to later.</p>
<p>Now, obviously the dinosaurs did not keep records of the temperature, so how we estimate temperatures on the ancient Earth is an important question, which deserves a long discussion&#8212;but not today!  Today I&#8217;ll be fairly sketchy about that.  I just want you to get a feel for the overall story, and some open questions.</p>
<h3> The Earth&#8217;s temperature since the last glacial period </h3>
<p>First, here&#8217;s a graph of Greenland temperatures over the last 18,000 years:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature/greenland.18kyr.gif"><img width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature/greenland.18kyr.gif" /></a></div>
<p>(As usual, click to enlarge and/or get more information.)   This chart is based on ice cores, taken from:</p>
<p>&bull; Richard B. Alley, <em>The Two-Mile Time Machine: Ice Cores, Abrupt Climate Change, and our Future</em>, Princeton U. Press, Princeton, 2002.</p>
<p>This is a good book for learning how people reconstruct the<br />
history of temperatures in Greenland from looking at a two-mile-long ice core drilled out of the glaciers there.</p>
<p>As you can see, first Greenland was very cold, and then it warmed up at the end of the last &#8216;ice age&#8217;, or glacial period.  But there are lot of other things to see in this graph.  For example, there was a severe cold spell between 12.9 and 11.5 thousand years ago: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Younger_Dryas"><b>Younger Dryas</b></a> event.</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dryas_octopetala"><img width="350" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/Mountainavens2.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>I love that name!   It comes from the tough little Arctic flower<br />
<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dryas_octopetala">Dryas octopetala</a></em>, whose plentiful pollen in certain ice samples gave evidence that this time period was chilly.    Was there an Older Dryas?  Yes: before the Younger Dryas there was a warm spell called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aller%C3%B8d_Oscillation">Aller&oslash;d</a>, and before that a cold period called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Older_Dryas">Older Dryas</a>.</p>
<p>The Younger Dryas lasted about 1400 years.  Temperatures dropped dramatically in Europe: about 7 &deg;C in only 20 years!   In Greenland, it was 15 &deg;C colder during the Younger Dryas than today.  In England, the average annual temperature was -5 &deg;C, so glaciers started forming.  We can see evidence of this event from <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature/temperature.html#greenland.20kyr">oxygen isotope records</a> and <a href="http://www.agu.org/revgeophys/mayews01/node6.html">many other things</a>.  </p>
<p>Why the sudden chill?  One popular theory is that the melting of the ice sheet on North America lowered the salinity of North Atlantic waters.  This in turn blocked a current called the<br />
<a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/AMOC">Atlantic meridional overturning circulation</a>, or AMOC for short, which normally brings warm water up the coast of Europe.   Proponents of this theory argue that this current is what makes London much warmer than, say, Winnipeg in Canada or Irkutsk in Russia.  Turn it off and&mdash;<em>wham!</em>&mdash;you&#8217;ll get glaciers forming in England.</p>
<p>Anyway, whatever caused it, the Younger Dryas ended as suddenly at it began, with temperatures jumping 7 &deg;C.   Since then, the Earth continued warming up until about 6 thousand years ago&#8212;the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_climatic_optimum">mid-Holocene thermal maximum</a>.   The earth was about 1&deg; or 2&deg; Celsius warmer than today.  Since then, it&#8217;s basically been cooling off&#8212;not counting various smaller variations, like the global warming we&#8217;re experiencing in this century.</p>
<p>However, these smaller variations are very interesting!  From 6000 to 2500 years ago things cooled down, with the coolest<br />
stretch occurring between 4000 and 2500 years ago: the <a HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Age_Cold_Epoch"><b>Iron Age Cold Epoch</b></a>.  </p>
<p>Then things warmed up for a while, and then they cooled down<br />
from 500 to 1000 AD.  Yes, the so-called &quot;Dark Ages&quot; were also chilly!  </p>
<p>After this came the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Warm_Period"><b>Medieval Warm Period</b></a>, a period from about 1000 to 1300 AD:  </p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://www.globalwarmingart.com/wiki/File:2000_Year_Temperature_Comparison_png"><img width="450" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/2000_Year_Temperature_Comparison.png" /></a></div>
<p>From 1450 AD to 1890 there was a period of cooling, often called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Ice_Age"><b>Little Ice Age</b></a>.  This killed off the Icelandic colonies in Greenland, as described in this gripping book:</p>
<p>&bull; Jane Smiley, <em>The Greenlanders</em>, Ballantine Books, New York, 1996. </p>
<p>However, the term &quot;Little Ice Age&quot; exaggerates the importance of a small blip in the grand scheme of things.  It was nowhere near as big as the Younger Dryas: temperatures may have dropped a measly 0.2&deg; Celsius from the Medieval optimum, and it may have happened only in Europe&#8212;though this was a subject of debate when I last checked.</p>
<p>Since then, things have been warming up:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://www.globalwarmingart.com/wiki/File:1000_Year_Temperature_Comparison_png"><img width="450" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/1000_Year_Temperature_Comparison.png" /></a></div>
<p>The subject has big political implications, and is thus subject to enormous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature_record_of_the_past_1000_years">controversy</a>. But, I think it&#8217;s quite safe to say that we&#8217;ve been seeing a rapid temperature rise since 1900, with the Northern Hemisphere average temperature rising roughly 1 &deg;C since then.  Each of the last 11 years, from 2001 to 2011, was one of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_temperature_record#Warmest_years">12 warmest years since 1901</a>.

<p>All these recent variations in the Earth&#8217;s climate are very much worth trying to understand.   but now let&#8217;s back off to longer time periods!  We don&#8217;t have many Earth-like planets whose climate we can study in detail&#8212;at least not yet, since they&#8217;re too far away.  But we do have one planet, the Earth, that&#8217;s gone through many changes.  The climate since the end of the last ice age is just a tiny sliver of a long and exciting story!</p>
<h3> The Earth&#8217;s long-term climate history </h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s a nice old chart showing estimates of the Earth&#8217;s average temperature in the last 150 years, the last 16,000 years, the last 150,000 years and the last million years:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature/1Myr.jpg"><img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature/1Myr.jpg" /><br />
</a></div>
<p>Here &#8220;ka&#8221; or &#8220;kilo-annum&#8221; means a thousand years.  These temperatures are estimated by various methods; I got this chart from:</p>
<p>&bull; Barry Saltzman, <i>Dynamical Paleoclimatology: Generalized Theory of Global Climate Change</i>, Academic Press, New York, 2002, fig. 3-4. </p>
<p>As we keep zooming in towards the present we keep seeing more detail:</p>
<p>&bull; Over the last million years there have been about ten glacial periods&#8212;though trying to count them is a bit like trying to count &#8216;very deep valleys&#8217; in a hilly landscape!</p>
<p>&bull; From 150 to 120 thousand years ago it warmed up rather rapidly. From 120 thousand years ago to 16 thousand years ago it cooled down&#8212;that was the last glacial period. Then it warmed up rather rapidly again.</p>
<p>&bull; Over the last 10 thousand years temperatures have been unusually constant.</p>
<p>&bull; Over the last 150 years it&#8217;s been warming up slightly. </p>
<p>If we go back further, say to 5 million years, we see that temperatures have been colder but also more erratic during this period:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://www.globalwarmingart.com/wiki/File:Five_Myr_Climate_Change_Rev_png"><img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature/5Myr.png" /></a></div>
<p>This figure is based on this paper:</p>
<p>&bull; L. E. Lisiecki and M. E. Raymo, A Pliocene-Pleistocene stack of 57 globally distributed benthic &delta;<sup>18</sup>O records, <i><a href="http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2005/2004PA001071.shtml">Paleoceanography</a></i> <b>20</b> (2005), PA1003. </p>
<p>Lisieki and Raymo combined measurements of oxygen isotopes in the shells of tiny sea creatures called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foraminifera">foraminifera</a> from 57 globally distributed deep sea sediment cores.  But beware: they constructed this record by first applying a computer aided process to align the data in each sediment core.  Then the resulting stacked record was tuned to make the positions of peaks and valleys match the known <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles">Milankovitch cycles</a> in the Earth&#8217;s orbit.  The temperature scale was chosen to match <a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/icecore/antarctica/vostok/vostok.html">Vostok ice core data</a>.  So, there are a lot of theoretical assumptions built into this graph.</p>
<p>Going back 65 million years, we see how unusual the current glacial cycles are:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature/65Myr.png"><img width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature/65Myr.png" /><br />
</a></div>
<p>Click to make this graph bigger; it&#8217;s from:</p>
<p>&bull; Robert Rohde, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:65_Myr_Climate_Change.png">65 million years of climate change</a>, at <a href="http://www.globalwarmingart.com/">Global Warming Art</a>.</p>
<p>This graph shows the Earth&#8217;s temperature since the extinction of the dinosaurs about 65 million years ago&mdash;the end of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a> and beginning of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cenozoic">Cenozoic</a>.  At first the Earth warmed up, reaching its warmest  50 million years ago: the &quot;Eocene Optimum&quot;. The spike before that labelled &quot;PETM&quot; is a fascinating event called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleocene-Eocene_Thermal_Maximum"> Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum</a>.   At the end of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eocene">Eocene</a> the Earth cooled rapidly and the Antarctic acquired year-round ice. After a warming spell near the end of the  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eocene">Oligocene</a>, further cooling and an increasingly jittery climate led ultimately to the current age of rapid glacial cycles.  </p>
<p>Why is the Earth&#8217;s climate so jittery nowadays?  That&#8217;s a fascinating puzzle, which I&#8217;d like to discuss in the weeks to come.  </p>
<p>Why did the Earth suddenly cool at the end of the Eocene 34 million years ago?  One theory relies on the fact that this is when Antarctica first became separated from Australia and South America.  After the <a href="http://a.ennyu.com/pdf/Exon_JoiJour_00.pdf">Tasmanian Gateway</a> between Australia and Antarctica opened, the only thing that kept water from swirling endlessly around Antarctica, getting colder and colder, was the connection between this continent and South America.  South America seems to have separated from Antarctica around the end of the Eocene. </p>
<p>In the early Eocene, Antarctica was fringed with a warm temperate to sub-tropical rainforest.  But as the Eocene progressed it became colder, and by the start of the Oligocene it had deciduous forests and vast stretches of tundra.  Eventually it became almost completely covered with ice.</p>
<p>Thanks to the ice albedo effect, an icy Antarctic tends to keep the Earth cooler.  But is that the only or even the <i>main</i> explanation of the overall cooling trend over the last 30 million years?  Scientists argue about this.</p>
<p>Going back further:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature/4600Myr.jpg"><img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature/4600Myr.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>Here &quot;Ma&quot; or &quot;mega-annum&quot; means &quot;million years&quot;.   This chart was drawn from many sources; I got it from: </p>
<p>&bull; Barry Saltzman, <em>Dynamical Paleoclimatology: Generalized Theory of Global Climate Change</em>, Academic Press, New York, 2002, fig. 1-3. </p>
<p>Among other things on this chart, you can sort of see hints of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowball_Earth">Snowball Earth</a> events that may have happened early in the Earth&#8217;s history.  These are thought to have occurred during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryogenian">Cryogenian period</a> 850 to 635 million years ago, and also during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huronian_glaciation">Huronian glaciation</a> 2400 to 2100 million years ago.  In both these events a large portion of the Earth was frozen&#8212;much more, it seems, than in the recent glacial periods!  Ice albedo feedback plays a big role in theories of these events&#8230; though also, of course, there must be some explanation of why they <i>ended</i>.</p>
<p>As you can see, there&#8217;s a lot of things a really universal climate model might seek to explain.  We don&#8217;t <i>necessarily</i> need to understand the whole Earth&#8217;s history to model it well <i>now</i>, but thinking about other eras is a good way to check our understanding of the present-day Earth.</p>

					<p><i>guest post by <b><a href="http://www.math.psu.edu/roe/">John Roe</a></b></i></p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silversprite/2314466250/"><img width="300" src="https://i2.wp.com/farm3.staticflickr.com/2024/2314466250_9445d155e3.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>This year, I want to develop a new math course.  Nothing surprising in that&#8212;it is what math professors do all the time!   But usually, when we dream of new courses, we are thinking of small classes of eager graduate students to whom we can explain the latest research ideas.   Here, I&#8217;m after something a bit different.</p>
<p>The goal will be <i>through a General Education Mathematics course, to enable students to develop the quantitative and qualitative skills needed to reason effectively about environmental and economic sustainability</i>.  That&#8217;s a lot of long words!   Let me unpack a bit:</p>
<p>&bull; <i>General Education Mathematics</i> At most universities (including Penn State University, where I teach), every student, whatever their major, has to take one or two &#8220;quantitative&#8221; courses &#8211; this is called the &#8220;general education&#8221; requirement.  I want to reach out to students who are not planning to be mathematicians or scientists, students for whom this may be the last math course they ever take. </p>
<p>&bull;  <i>quantitative and qualitative skills</i> I want students to be able to work with numbers (&#8220;quantitative&#8221;)&#8212;to be able to get a feeling for scale and size, whether we&#8217;re talking about gigatonnes of carbon dioxide, kilowatts of domestic power, or picograms of radioisotopes.  But I also want them to get an intuition for the behavior of systems (qualitative), so that the ideas of growth, feedback, oscillation, overshoot and so on become part of their conceptual vocabulary.</p>
<p>&bull; <i>to reason effectively</i> A transition to a more sustainable society won&#8217;t come about without robust public debate&#8212;I want to help students engage effectively in this debate. Shamelessly stealing ideas from Andrew Read&#8217;s <a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/afr3/blogs/SIOW_Reflections/">Science in Our World</a> course, I hope to do this by using an online platform for student presentations. Engaging with this process (which includes commenting on other people&#8217;s presentations as well as devising your own) will count seriously in the grading scheme.</p>
<p>&bull; <i>environmental and economic sustainability</i> I&#8217;d like students to get the idea that there are lots of scales on which one can ask the sustainability question &#8211; both time scales (how many years is &#8220;sustainable&#8221;) and spatial scales.  We&#8217;ll think about global-scale questions (carbon dioxide emissions being an obvious example) but we&#8217;ll try to look at as many examples as possible on a local scale (a single building, the Penn State campus, local agriculture) so that we can engage more directly.  </p>
<p>I have been thinking about this plan for a year or more but now it&#8217;s time to put it into action.  I&#8217;ve been in touch with my department head and got a green light to offer this for the first time in Spring 2014. In future posts I will share some more about the structure of the course as it develops.  Meanwhile, if anyone has some good suggestions, let me know!</p>

<div align="center"><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/huge_blackboard.jpg"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/huge_blackboard_small.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>There are theorems whose shortest proof is insanely long.  In 1936 Kurt Gödel published an abstract called “On the length of proofs”, which makes essentially this claim.</p>
<p>But what does &#8216;insanely long&#8217; mean?</p>
<p>To get warmed up, let&#8217;s talk about some long proofs.</p>
<h3> Long proofs </h3>
<p>You&#8217;ve surely heard of the quadratic formula, which lets you solve</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a+x%5E2+%2B+b+x+%2B+c++%3D+0+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a x^2 + b x + c  = 0 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>with the help of a square root:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+x+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B-b+%5Cpm+%5Csqrt%7Bb%5E2+-+4+a+c%7D%7D%7B2+a%7D+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ x = &#92;frac{-b &#92;pm &#92;sqrt{b^2 - 4 a c}}{2 a} }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a similar but more complicated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_function#General_formula_of_roots">&#8216;cubic formula&#8217;</a> that lets you solve cubic equations, like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a+x%5E3+%2B+b+x%5E2+%2B+c+x+%2B+d+%3D+0+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a x^3 + b x^2 + c x + d = 0 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>The cubic formula involves both square roots and cube roots.  There&#8217;s also a <a href="http://planetmath.org/quarticforumula">&#8216;quartic formula&#8217;</a> for equations of degree 4, like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a+x%5E4+%2B+b+x%5E3+%2B+c+x%5E2+%2B+d+x+%2B+e+%3D+0+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a x^4 + b x^3 + c x^2 + d x + e = 0 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>The quartic formula is so long that I can only show you an absurdly shrunken version:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/quartic_formula.jpg"><img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/quartic_formula.png" /></a></div>
<p>(Click repeatedly to enlarge.)  But again, it only involves additions, subtraction, multiplication, division and taking roots.</p>
<p>In 1799, Paolo Ruffini proved that there was no general solution using radicals for polynomial equations of degree 5 or more.  But his proof was 500 pages long!  As a result, it was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abel%E2%80%93Ruffini_theorem#History">&#8220;mostly ignored&#8221;</a>.  I&#8217;m not sure what that means, exactly.  Did most people ignore it completely?  Or did everyone ignore most of it?   Anyway, his argument seems to have a gap&#8230; and later Niels Abel gave a proof that was just 6 pages long, so most people give the lion&#8217;s share of credit to Abel.</p>
<p>Jumping ahead quite a lot, the longest proof written up in journals is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification_of_finite_simple_groups">classification of finite simple groups</a>.  This was done by lots of people in lots of papers, and the total length is somewhere between 10,000 and 20,000 pages&#8230; nobody is exactly sure!  People are trying to simplify it and rewrite it.  The new proof will be a mere 5,000 pages long.  So far six books have been written as part of this project.</p>
<p>Even when it&#8217;s all in one book, how can we be sure such a long proof is right?  Some people want to use computers to make the argument completely rigorous, filling in all the details with the help of a program called a &#8216;proof assistant&#8217;.</p>
<p>The French are so sexy that even their proof assistant sounds dirty: it&#8217;s called <a href="http://coq.inria.fr/">Coq</a>.   <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/news/features/gonthierproof-101112.aspx">Recently</a> mathematicians led by George Gonthier have used Coq to give a completely detailed proof of a small piece of the classification of finite simple groups: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feit%E2%80%93Thompson_theorem">Feit&#8211;Thompson Theorem</a>.   Feit and Thompson&#8217;s original proof of this result, skipping lots of steps that are obvious to experts, took 255 pages!</p>
<p>What does the Feit&#8211;Thompson theorem say?  Every finite group with an odd number of elements is solvable!  Explaining that statement might take quite a while, depending on what you know about math.  So let me just say this:</p>
<p>Galois invented group theory and used it to go further than Abel and Ruffini had.  He showed a bunch of <i>specific</i> polynomial equations couldn&#8217;t be solved just using addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and taking roots.  For example, those operations aren&#8217;t powerful enough to solve this equation:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E5+-+x+%2B+1+%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x^5 - x + 1 = 0" class="latex" /></p>
<p>while they can solve this one:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E5+-+x+%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x^5 - x = 0" class="latex" /></p>
<p>Galois showed that every polynomial equation has a group of symmetries, and you can solve the equation using addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and taking roots if its group has a certain special property.  So, this property of a group got the name <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvable_group">&#8216;solvability&#8217;</a>.</p>
<p><i>Every finite group with an odd number of elements is solvable</i>.  It&#8217;s quick to say, but hard to show&#8212;so hard that making the proof fully rigorous on a computer seemed out of reach at first:</p>
<blockquote><p>
When Gonthier first suggested a formal Feit-Thompson Theorem proof, his fellow members of the Mathematical Components team at Inria could hardly believe their ears.</p>
<p>“The reaction of the team the first time we had a meeting and I exposed a grand plan,” he recalls ruefully, “was that I had delusions of grandeur. But the real reason of having this project was to understand how to build all these theories, how to make them fit together, and to validate all of this by carrying out a proof that was clearly deemed to be out of reach at the time we started the project.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>It took them 6 years!  The completed computer proof has 170,000 lines.  It involves 15,000 definitions and 4,300 lemmas.  Maybe now Gonthier is dreaming of computerizing the whole classification of finite simple groups.</p>
<p>But there are even longer proofs of important results in math.  These longer proofs all involve computer calculations.  For example, Thomas Hales seems to have proved that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_conjecture">the densest packing of spheres in 3d space is the obvious one</a>, like this:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="300" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/cubic_close_packing.jpg" />
</div>
<p>(There are infinitely many other <i>equally</i> dense packings, as I <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/04/15/ice/">explained earlier</a>, but none denser.)</p>
<p>Hales&#8217; proof is a hundred pages of writing <i>together with about 3 gigabytes of computer calculations</i>.  If we wrote out those calculations in a text file, they&#8217;d fill about <a href="http://www.lexisnexis.com/applieddiscovery/lawlibrary/whitePapers/ADI_FS_PagesInAGigabyte.pdf">2 million pages!</a></p>
<p>The method is called &#8216;proof by exhaustion&#8217;, because it involves reducing the problem to 10,000 special cases and then settling each one with detailed calculations&#8230; thus exhausting anybody who tries to check the proof by hand.  Now Hales is trying to create a fully formal proof that can be verified by automated proof checking software such as <a href="http://hol.sourceforge.net/">HOL</a>.  He expects that doing this will take 20 years.</p>
<p>These proofs are long, but they&#8217;re not what I&#8217;d call <i>insanely</i> long.</p>
<h3> Insanely long proofs </h3>
<p>What do I mean by &#8216;insanely&#8217; long?  Well, for example, I know a theorem that you can prove using the usual axioms of arithmetic&#8212;Peano arithmetic&#8212;but whose shortest proof using those axioms contains</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5E%7B1000%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="10^{1000}" class="latex" /></p>
<p>symbols.  This is so many symbols that you couldn&#8217;t write them all down if you wrote one symbol on each proton, neutron and electron in the observable Universe!</p>
<p>I also know a theorem whose shortest proof in Peano arithmetic contains</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5E%7B10%5E%7B1000%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="10^{10^{1000}}" class="latex" /></p>
<p>symbols.  This is so many that if you tried to write down the <i>number</i> of symbols&#8212;not the symbols themselves&#8212;in ordinary decimal notation, you couldn&#8217;t do it if you wrote one digit on each proton, neutron and electron in the observable Universe!</p>
<p>I also know a theorem whose shortest proof in Peano arithmetic contains&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230; well, you get the idea.</p>
<p>By the way, if you don&#8217;t know what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms#First-order_theory_of_arithmetic">Peano arithmetic</a> is, don&#8217;t worry.  It&#8217;s just a list of obvious axioms about arithmetic, together with some obvious rules for reasoning, which turn out to be good enough to prove most everyday theorems about arithmetic.  The main reason I mention it is that we need to pick <i>some</i> particular setup before we can talk about the &#8216;shortest proof&#8217; of a theorem and have it be well-defined.</p>
<p>Also by the way, I&#8217;m assuming Peano arithmetic is consistent.  If it were inconsistent, you could prove 0=1, and then everything would follow quite quickly from that.  But most people feel sure it&#8217;s consistent.</p>
<p>If it is, then the shortest proof using Peano arithmetic of the following theorem contains at least <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5E%7B1000%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="10^{1000}" class="latex" /> symbols:</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>Huh?  This doesn&#8217;t look a statement about arithmetic!  But G&ouml;del showed how you could encode the concept of &#8216;statement&#8217; and &#8216;proof&#8217; into arithmetic, and use this to create statements that refer to themselves.   He&#8217;s most famous for this one:</p>
<blockquote><p>
This statement has no proof in Peano arithmetic.
</p></blockquote>
<p>It turns out that this statement is true&#8230; so it&#8217;s an example of a true statement about arithmetic that can&#8217;t be proved using Peano arithmetic!  This is G&ouml;del&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_sketch_for_G%C3%B6del%27s_first_incompleteness_theorem"><b>first incompleteness theorem</b></a>.</p>
<p>This variation is similar:</p>
<blockquote><p>
This statement has no proof in Peano arithmetic that contains fewer than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5E%7B1000%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="10^{1000}" class="latex" /> symbols.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This statement is also true.  It&#8217;s provable in Peano arithmetic, but its proof contains at least <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5E%7B1000%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="10^{1000}" class="latex" /> symbols.</p>
<h3> Even longer proofs </h3>
<p>But this is just the beginning.   If Peano arithmetic is consistent, there are infinitely many theorems whose shortest proof is longer than 10 to the 10 to the 10 to the 10 to the&#8230; where the stack of 10&#8217;s is as long as the statement of the theorem.</p>
<p>Indeed, take <i>any computable function</i>, say F&#8212;growing as fast as you like.   Then if Peano arithmetic is consistent, there are infinitely many theorems whose shortest proof is longer than this function of the length of the theorem!</p>
<p>But how do we <i>know</i> this?  Here&#8217;s how.  Using Gödel&#8217;s clever ideas, we can create a statement in arithmetic that says:</p>
<blockquote><p>
This statement has no proof in Peano arithmetic that is shorter than F of the length of this statement.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Let&#8217;s call this statement P.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll show that if Peano arithmetic is consistent, then P is provable in Peano arithmetic.   <i>So, according to what P itself says, P is an example of a statement whose shortest proof is insanely long!</i></p>
<p>Now, let me sketch why if Peano arithmetic is consistent then P is provable in this setup.   To save time, I&#8217;ll use N to stand for &#8216;F of the length of P&#8217;.   So, P says:</p>
<blockquote><p>
P has no proof in Peano arithmetic whose length is less than N.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Assume there <i>were</i> a proof of P in Peano arithmetic whose length is less than N.  Then, thanks to what P actually says, P would be false.</p>
<p>Moreover, we could carry out the argument I just gave within Peano arithmetic.  So, within Peano arithmetic, we could disprove P.</p>
<p>But wait a minute&#8212;this would mean that within Peano arithmetic we could both prove and disprove P!  We&#8217;re assuming Peano arithmetic is consistent, so this is impossible.</p>
<p>So our assumption must have been wrong.  P must have no proof in Peano arithmetic whose length is less than N.</p>
<p>But this is what P says!  So P is true!</p>
<p>Even better, P is provable in Peano arithmetic.  Why?  Because we can just go through all proofs shorter than N, and check that they&#8217;re not proofs of P&#8230; we know they won&#8217;t be&#8230; and this will constitute a proof that:</p>
<blockquote><p>
P has no proof in Peano arithmetic whose length is less than N.
</p></blockquote>
<p>But this is just what P says!  So this is a way to prove P.  Moreover we can carry out this long-winded check within Peano arithmetic, and get a proof of P <i>in Peano arithmetic!</i></p>
<p>Of course, this proof has length more than N.</p>
<p>By the way, here I&#8217;m using the fact that there are only finitely many proofs with length less than N, so we can go through them all.  We have to define &#8216;length&#8217; in a way that makes this true, for my argument to work.  For example, we can take the length to be the number of symbols.</p>
<p>Also, it&#8217;s important that our function F be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computable_function">computable</a>.  We need to compute N to know how many proofs we need to go through.</p>
<p>The upshot: if Peano arithmetic is consistent, there&#8217;s a provable statement whose shortest proof in Peano arithmetic is insanely long, by any computable standard of what counts as &#8216;insanely long&#8217;.</p>
<p>Now, so far we&#8217;ve just gotten <i>one</i> theorem with an insanely long proof.  But we can get infinitely many, one for each natural number n, as follows.  Let P(n) be a statement in arithmetic that says:</p>
<blockquote><p>
This statement has no proof in Peano arithmetic whose length is less than n plus F of the length of this statement.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The same argument I just sketched shows that if Peano arithmetic is consistent then P(n) is provable, but has no proof shorter than n plus F of the length of P(n).  The statements P(n) are different for different values of n.    So, we get infinitely many different statements with insanely long proofs&#8230; at least if Peano arithmetic is consistent, which most people believe.</p>
<h3> Proof speedup </h3>
<p>But wait a minute!  If we&#8217;ve proved all these statements P(n) have proofs, then we&#8217;ve basically proved them&#8212;no?  And my argument, though sketchy, was quite short.  So, even a completely detailed version of my argument should not be &#8216;insanely long&#8217;.  Doesn&#8217;t that contradict my claim that the shortest proofs of these statements are insanely long?</p>
<p>Well, no.  I only showed that the shortest proof of P(n) <i>using Peano arithmetic</i> is insanely long.  I did provide a short proof of P(n).  But I did this <i>assuming Peano arithmetic is consistent!</i></p>
<p>So I didn&#8217;t give a short proof of P(n) using Peano arithmetic.  I gave a short proof using Peano arithmetic <i>plus the assumption that Peano arithmetic is consistent!</i></p>
<p>So, if we add to Peano arithmetic an extra axiom saying &#8216;Peano arithmetic is consistent&#8217;, infinitely many theorems get vastly shorter proofs!</p>
<p>This is often called <b>Gödel&#8217;s speedup theorem</b>.  For more, see:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_speed-up_theorem">Gödel&#8217;s speedup theorem</a>, Wikipedia.</p>
<h3> Connections </h3>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty cool how just <i>knowing Peano arithmetic was consistent</i> would let us vastly shorten infinitely many proofs.</p>
<p>As an instant consequence, we get G&ouml;del&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems#Second_incompleteness_theorem"><b>second incompleteness theorem</b></a>: it&#8217;s impossible to use Peano arithmetic to prove its own consistency.  For if we could, adding that consistency as an extra axiom couldn&#8217;t shorten proofs by an arbitrarily large amount.  It could only shorten proofs by a fixed finite amount: roughly, the number of symbols in the proof that Peano arithmetic is consistent.</p>
<p>And while we&#8217;re at it, let&#8217;s note how the existence of insanely long proofs is related to another famous result: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entscheidungsproblem"><b>Church&#8211;Turing theorem</b></a>.  This says it&#8217;s impossible to write a computer program that can decide in a finite time, yes or no, whether any given statement is provable in Peano arithmetic.</p>
<p>Suppose that in Peano arithmetic there were a computable upper bound on the length of a proof of any statement, as a function of the length of that statement.  Then we could write a program that would go through all potential proofs of any statement and tell us, in a finite amount of time, whether it had a proof.  So, Peano arithmetic would be decidable!</p>
<p>But since it&#8217;s not decidable, no such computable upper bound can exist.  This is another way of seeing that there must be theorems with insanely long proofs.</p>
<p>So, the existence of insanely long proofs is tightly connected to the inability of Peano arithmetic to prove itself consistent, and also the undecidability of Peano arithmetic.  And these are features not just of Peano arithmetic, but of <i>any</i> system of arithmetic that&#8217;s sufficiently powerful, yet simple enough that we can write a program to check to see if a purported proof really is a proof.</p>
<h3> Buss&#8217; speedup theorem </h3>
<p>In fact Gödel stated his result in a more sophisticated way than I did.  He never published a proof&#8230; but <i>not</i> because the proof is insanely long, probably just because he was a busy man with many ideas.  Samuel Buss gave a proof in 1994:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~sbuss/ResearchWeb/godelone/index.html">On G&ouml;del&#8217;s theorems on lengths of proofs I: Number of lines and speedups for arithmetic</a>, <i>Journal of Symbolic Logic</i> <b>39</b> (1994), 737&#8211;756.</p>
<p>In <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_arithmetic#First-order_theory_of_arithmetic">first-order arithmetic</a></b> you can use variables like x,y,z to stand for natural numbers like 0,1,2,3,&#8230;  This is the kind of arithmetic I&#8217;ve been talking about so far: Peano arithmetic is an example.   In <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-order_arithmetic">second-order arithmetic</a></b> you can also use variables of a different kind to stand for <i>sets</i> of natural numbers.  <b>Third-order arithmetic</b> goes further and lets you use variables for <i>sets of sets</i> of natural numbers, and so on.</p>
<p>Gödel claimed, and Buss showed, that each time you go up an order, some statements that were already provable get insanely shorter proofs.  So, turning this fact around, there are theorems that have insanely long proofs in first-order arithmetic!</p>
<p>(And similarly for second-order arithmetic, and so on&#8230;)</p>
<p>For more details, explained in a fairly friendly way, try:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel/#SpeUpThe">Speed-up theorems</a>, <i>Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</i>.</p>
<p>By the way, this post is a kind of followup to my post on <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/04/24/enormous-integers/">enormous integers</a>.  Insanely long proofs are <i>related</i> to enormous integers: if you know a quick way to describe an enormous integer, you can use the trick I described to cook up a theorem with an enormous proof.</p>
<p>Last time we saw the logician Harvey Friedman was a master of enormous integers.  So it&#8217;s not surprising to me that Wikipedia says:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Harvey Friedman found some explicit natural examples of this phenomenon, giving some explicit statements in Peano arithmetic and other formal systems whose shortest proofs are ridiculously long.
</p></blockquote>
<p>However, I don&#8217;t know these statements.  I assume they&#8217;re more natural than the weird self-referential examples I&#8217;ve described.  What are they?</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>This week I&#8217;ll release these notes <i>before</i> my seminar, so my students (and all of you, too) can read them ahead of time.  The reason is that I&#8217;m pushing into topics I don&#8217;t understand as well as I&#8217;d like.  So, my notes wrestle with some ideas in too much detail to cover in class&#8212;and I&#8217;m hoping some students will look at these notes ahead of time to prepare.  Also, I&#8217;d appreciate your comments!</p>
<p>This week I&#8217;ll borrow material shamelessly from here:</p>
<p>&bull; Seymour L. Hess, <i>Introduction to Theoretical Meteorology</i>, Henry Holt and Company, New York, 1959.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an old book: for example, it talks about working out the area under a curve using a gadget called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planimeter">planimeter</a>, which is what people did before computers.</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planimeter"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Polarplanimeter_01.JPG/320px-Polarplanimeter_01.JPG" /></a></div>
<p>It also talks about how people measured the solar constant (roughly, the brightness of the Sun) before we could easily put satellites up above the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere!   And it doesn&#8217;t mention global warming.  </p>
<p>But despite or perhaps even because of these quaint features, it&#8217;s simple and clear.  In case it&#8217;s not obvious yet, I&#8217;m teaching this quarter&#8217;s seminar in order to learn stuff.  So, I&#8217;ll sometimes talk about old work&#8230; but if you catch me saying things that are seriously wrong (as opposed to merely primitive), please let me know.</p>
<h3> The plan </h3>
<p>Last time we considered a simple model Earth, a blackbody at uniform constant temperature absorbing sunlight and re-emitting the same amount of power in the form of blackbody radiation.  We worked out that its temperature would be 6 &deg;C, which is not bad.  But then we took into account the fact that the Earth is not black.  We got a temperature of -18 &deg;C, which is too cold.  The reason is that we haven&#8217;t yet equipped our model Earth with an atmosphere!  So today let&#8217;s try that.</p>
<p>At this point things get a lot more complicated, even if we try a 1-dimensional model where the temperature, pressure and other features of the atmosphere only depend on altitude.  So, I&#8217;ll only do what I can easily do. I&#8217;ll explain some basic laws governing radiation, and then sketch how people applied them to the Earth.</p>
<p>It&#8217;ll be good to start with a comment about what we did last time.</p>
<h3> Kirchoff&#8217;s law of radiation </h3>
<p>When we admitted the Earth wasn&#8217;t black, we said that it <i>absorbed</i> only about 70% of the radiation hitting it&#8230; but we still modeled it as <i>emitting</i> radiation just like a blackbody!  Isn&#8217;t there something fishy about this?   </p>
<p>Well, no.  The Earth is mainly absorbing sunlight at visible frequencies, and at these frequencies it only absorbs about 70% of the radiation that hits it.  But it mainly emits infrared light, and at these frequencies it acts like it&#8217;s almost black.  These frequencies are almost completely different from those where absorption occurs.</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ecological/earth_and_sun_emission.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p>But still, this issue is worth thinking about.</p>
<p>After all, emission and absorption are flip sides of the same coin.  There&#8217;s a deep principle in physics, called <b>reciprocity</b>, which says that how X affects Y is not a separate question from how Y affects X.  In fact, if you know the answer to one of these questions, you can figure out the answer to the other!</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion#Newton.27s_third_law"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Skaters_showing_newtons_third_law.svg/300px-Skaters_showing_newtons_third_law.svg.png" /></a></div>
<p>The first place most people see this principle is Newton&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion#Newton.27s_third_law">third law of classical mechanics</a>, saying that if X exerts a force on Y, Y exerts an equal and opposite force on X.  </p>
<p>For example: if I punched your nose, your nose punched my fist just as hard, so you have no right to complain.  <img src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/emoticons/grumpy.gif" />   </p>
<p>This law is still often stated in its old-fashioned form:</p>
<blockquote><p>
For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I found this confusing as a student, because &#8216;force&#8217; was part of the formal terminology of classical mechanics, but not &#8216;action&#8217;&#8212;at least not as used in this sentence!&#8212;and certainly not &#8216;reaction&#8217;.   But as a statement of the basic intuition behind reciprocity, it&#8217;s got a certain charm.  </p>
<p>In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocity_%28engineering%29">engineering</a>, the principle of reciprocity is sometimes stated like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Reciprocity in linear systems is the principle that the response <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R_%7Bab%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="R_{ab}" class="latex" /> measured at a location <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a" class="latex" /> when the system is excited at a location <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="b" class="latex" /> is exactly equal to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R_%7Bba%7D%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="R_{ba}," class="latex" /> which is the response at location <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="b" class="latex" /> when that same excitation is applied at <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a." class="latex" />  This applies for all frequencies of the excitation.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Again this is a bit confusing, at least if you&#8217;re a mathematician who would like to know exactly how a &#8216;response&#8217; or an &#8216;excitation&#8217; is defined.  It&#8217;s also disappointing to see the principle stated in a way that limits it to linear systems.  Nonetheless it&#8217;s tremendously inspiring.  <i>What&#8217;s really going on here?</i>   </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t claim to have gotten to the bottom of it.   My hunch is that to a large extent it will come down to the fact that mixed partial derivatives commute.  If we&#8217;ve got a smooth function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" /> of a bunch of variables <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+x_n%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x_1, &#92;dots, x_n," class="latex" /> and we set</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+R_%7Bab%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial%5E2+f%7D%7B%5Cpartial+x_a+%5Cpartial+x_b%7D+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ R_{ab} = &#92;frac{&#92;partial^2 f}{&#92;partial x_a &#92;partial x_b} } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>then </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R_%7Bab%7D+%3D+R_%7Bba%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="R_{ab} = R_{ba} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>However, I haven&#8217;t gotten around to showing that reciprocity boils down to this in all the examples yet.  Yet another unification project to add to my list!</p>
<p>Anyway: reciprocity has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocity_%28electromagnetism%29">lots of interesting applications to electromagnetism</a>.   And that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re really talking about now.  After all, light is electromagnetic radiation!  </p>
<p>The simplest application is one we learn as children: </p>
<blockquote><p>
If I can see you, then you can see me.
</p></blockquote>
<p>or at least:</p>
<blockquote><p>
If light can go from X to Y in a static environment, it can also go from Y to X.
</p></blockquote>
<p>But we want something that sounds a bit different.  Namely: </p>
<blockquote><p>
The tendency of a substance to <i>absorb</i> light at some frequency equals its tendency to <i>emit</i> light at that frequency.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is too vague.  We should make it precise, and in a minute I&#8217;ll try, but first let me motivate this idea with a thought experiment.  Suppose we have a black rock and a white rock in a sealed mirrored container.  Suppose they&#8217;re in thermal equilibrium at a very high temperature, so they&#8217;re glowing red-hot.  So, there&#8217;s red light bouncing around the container.   The black rock will absorb more of this light.  But since they&#8217;re in thermal equilibrium, the black rock must also be <i>emitting</i> more of this light, or it would gain energy and get hotter than the white one.  That would violate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeroth_law_of_thermodynamics">zeroth law of thermodynamics</a>, which implies that in thermal equilibrium, all the parts of a system must be at the same temperature.</p>
<p>More precisely, we have:</p>
<p><b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchhoff%27s_law_of_thermal_radiation">Kirchoff&#8217;s Law of Thermal Radiation</a>.</b>  For any body in thermal equilibrium, its emissivity equals its absorptivity.</p>
<p>Let me explain.  Suppose we have a surface made of some homogeneous isotropic material in thermal equilibrium at temperature <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T." class="latex" />  If it&#8217;s perfectly black, we saw <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/10/11/mathematics-of-the-environment-part-2/">last time</a> that it emits light with a monochromatic energy flux given by the <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_law">Planck distribution</a></b>:</p>

<p>Here <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;lambda" class="latex" /> is the wavelength of light and the &#8216;monochromatic energy flux&#8217; has units of power per area per wavelength.</p>
<p>But if our surface is not perfectly black, we have to multiply this by a fudge factor between 0 and 1 to get the right answer.  This factor is called the <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emissivity">emissivity</a></b> of the substance.  It can depend on the wavelength of the light quite a lot, and also on the surface&#8217;s temperature (since for example ice melts at high temperatures and gets darker).  So, let&#8217;s call it <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e_%5Clambda%28T%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="e_&#92;lambda(T)." class="latex" /></p>
<p>We can also talk about the <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorbance">absorptivity</a></b> of our surface, which is the fraction of light it absorbs.  Again this depends on the wavelength of the light and the temperature of our surface.  So, let&#8217;s call it <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_%5Clambda%28T%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a_&#92;lambda(T)." class="latex" /></p>
<p>Then Kirchoff&#8217;s law of thermal radiation says</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e_%5Clambda%28T%29+%3D+a_%5Clambda%28T%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="e_&#92;lambda(T) = a_&#92;lambda(T) " class="latex" /></p>
<p>So, for each frequency the emissivity must equal the absorptivity&#8230; but it&#8217;s still possible for the Earth to have an average emissivity near 1 at the wavelengths of infrared light and near 0.7 at the wavelengths of visible light.  So there&#8217;s no paradox.</p>
<p><b>Puzzle 1.</b>  Is this law named after the same guy who discovered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchhoff%27s_circuit_laws">Kirchhoff&#8217;s laws</a> governing electrical circuits?</p>
<h3> Schwarzschild&#8217;s equation </h3>
<p>Now let&#8217;s talk about light shining through the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere.   Or more generally, light shining through a medium.   What happens?  It can get absorbed.  It can get scattered, bouncing off in different directions.  Light can also get <i>emitted</i>, especially if the medium is hot.  The air in our atmosphere isn&#8217;t hot enough to emit a lot of visible light, but it definitely emits infrared light and microwaves.</p>
<p>It sounds complicated, and it is, but there are things we can say about it.  Let me tell you about Schwarzschild&#8217;s equation.</p>
<p>Light comes in different wavelengths.  So, can ask how much power per square meter this light carries per wavelength.   We call this the <b>monochromatic energy flux</b> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I_%7B%5Clambda%7D%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="I_{&#92;lambda}," class="latex" /> since it depends on the wavelength <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;lambda." class="latex" />   As mentioned <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/10/11/mathematics-of-the-environment-part-2/">last time</a>, this has units W/m<sup>2</sup>μm, where μm stands for micrometers, a unit of wavelength.   </p>
<p>However, because light gets absorbed, scattered and emitted the monochromatic energy flux is really a function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I_%7B%5Clambda%7D%28s%29%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="I_{&#92;lambda}(s)," class="latex" /> where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="s" class="latex" /> is the distance through the medium.  Here I&#8217;m imagining an essentially one-dimensional situation, like a beam of sunlight coming down through the air when the Sun is directly overhead.  We can generalize this later.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s figure out the basic equation describing how <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I_%7B%5Clambda%7D%28s%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="I_{&#92;lambda}(s)" class="latex" /> changes as a function of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="s." class="latex" />  This is called the <a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiative_transfer"><b>equation of radiative transfer</b></a>, or <b>Schwarzschild&#8217;s equation</b>.  It won&#8217;t tell us how different gases absorb different amounts of light of different frequencies&#8212;for that we need to do hard calculations, or experiments.  But we can feed the results of these calculations into Schwarzschild&#8217;s equation.</p>
<p>For starters, let&#8217;s assume that light only gets absorbed but not emitted or scattered.  Later we&#8217;ll include emission, which is very important for what we&#8217;re doing: the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere is warm enough to emit significant amounts of infrared light (though not hot enough to emit much visible light).  Scattering is also very important, but it can be treated as a combination of absorption and emission.</p>
<p>For absorption only, we have the <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer%E2%80%93Lambert_law">Beer&#8211;Lambert law</a></b>:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B++%5Cfrac%7Bd+I_%5Clambda%28s%29%7D%7Bd+s%7D+%3D+-+a_%5Clambda%28s%29+I_%5Clambda%28s%29++%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{  &#92;frac{d I_&#92;lambda(s)}{d s} = - a_&#92;lambda(s) I_&#92;lambda(s)  }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>In other words, the amount of radiation that gets absorbed per distance is proportional to the amount of radiation.  However, the constant of proportionality <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_%5Clambda+%28s%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a_&#92;lambda (s)" class="latex" /> can depend on the frequency and the details of our medium at the position <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="s." class="latex" />   I don&#8217;t know the standard name for this constant <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_%5Clambda+%28s%29%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a_&#92;lambda (s)," class="latex" /> so let&#8217;s call it the <b>absorption rate</b>.  </p>
<p><b>Puzzle 2.</b>  Assuming the Beer&#8211;Lambert law, show that the intensity of light at two positions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s_1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="s_1" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s_2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="s_2" class="latex" /> is related by</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+I_%5Clambda%28s_2%29+%3D+e%5E%7B-%5Ctau%7D+%5C%3B+I_%5Clambda%28s_1%29+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ I_&#92;lambda(s_2) = e^{-&#92;tau} &#92;; I_&#92;lambda(s_1) } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>where the <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_depth">optical depth</a></b> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;tau" class="latex" /> of the intervening medium is defined by</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Ctau+%3D+%5Cint_%7Bs_1%7D%5E%7Bs_2%7D+a_%5Clambda%28s%29+%5C%2C+ds+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;tau = &#92;int_{s_1}^{s_2} a_&#92;lambda(s) &#92;, ds } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>So, a layer of stuff has optical depth equal to 1 if light shining through it has its intensity reduced by a factor of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2Fe.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="1/e." class="latex" />  </p>
<p>We can go a bit further if our medium is a rather thin gas like the air in our atmosphere.  Then the absorption rate is given by</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_%5Clambda%28s%29+%3D+k_%5Clambda%28s%29+%5C%2C+%5Crho%28s%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a_&#92;lambda(s) = k_&#92;lambda(s) &#92;, &#92;rho(s) " class="latex" /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho%28s%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;rho(s)" class="latex" /> is the density of the air at the position <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="s" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k_%5Clambda%28s%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k_&#92;lambda(s)" class="latex" /> is its <b>absorption coefficient</b>.   </p>
<p>In other words, air absorbs light at a rate proportional to its density, but also depending on what it&#8217;s made of, which may vary with position.  For example, both the density and the humidity of the atmosphere can depend on its altitude.</p>
<p>What about emission?  Air doesn&#8217;t just absorb infrared light, it also emits significant amounts of it!   As mentioned, a blackbody at temperature <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T" class="latex" /> emits light with a monochromatic energy flux given by the <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_law">Planck distribution</a></b>:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+f_%7B%5Clambda%7D%28T%29+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B2+hc%5E2%7D%7B%5Clambda%5E5%7D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B+e%5E%7B%5Cfrac%7Bhc%7D%7B%5Clambda+k+T%7D%7D+-+1+%7D+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ f_{&#92;lambda}(T) = &#92;frac{2 hc^2}{&#92;lambda^5} &#92;frac{1}{ e^{&#92;frac{hc}{&#92;lambda k T}} - 1 } } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>But a gas like air is far from a blackbody, so we have to multiply this by a fudge factor.  Luckily, thanks to Kirchoff&#8217;s law of radiation, this factor isn&#8217;t so fudgy: it&#8217;s just the absorption rate <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_%5Clambda%28s%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a_&#92;lambda(s)." class="latex" /> </p>
<p>Here are we generalizing Kirchoff&#8217;s law from a surface to a column of air, but that&#8217;s okay because we can treat a column as a stack of surfaces; letting these become very thin we arrive at a differential formulation of the law that applies to absorption and emission rates instead of absorptivity and emissivity.  (If you&#8217;re very sharp, you&#8217;ll remember that Kirchoff&#8217;s law applies to thermal equilibrium, and wonder about that.  Air in the atmosphere isn&#8217;t in perfect thermal equilibrium, but it&#8217;s close enough for what we&#8217;re doing here.)</p>
<p>So, when we take absorption <i>and also emission</i> into account, Beer&#8217;s law gets another term:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B++%5Cfrac%7Bd+I_%5Clambda%28s%29%7D%7Bd+s%7D+%3D+-+a_%5Clambda%28s%29+I_%5Clambda%28s%29+%2B+a_%5Clambda%28s%29+f_%5Clambda%28T%28s%29%29+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{  &#92;frac{d I_&#92;lambda(s)}{d s} = - a_&#92;lambda(s) I_&#92;lambda(s) + a_&#92;lambda(s) f_&#92;lambda(T(s)) }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T" class="latex" /> is the temperature of our gas at the position <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="s." class="latex" />  In other words:</p>

<p>This is <b>Schwarzschild&#8217;s equation</b>.</p>
<p><b>Puzzle 3.</b>  Is this equation named after the same guy who discovered the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_metric">Schwarzschild metric</a> in general relativity, describing a spherically symmetric black hole?</p>
<h3> Application to the atmosphere </h3>
<p>In principle, we can use Schwarzschild&#8217;s equation to help work out how much sunlight of any frequency actually makes it through the atmosphere down to the Earth, and also how much infrared radiation makes it through the atmosphere out to space.  But this is not a calculation I can do here today, because it&#8217;s very complicated.</p>
<p>If we actually measure what fraction of radiation of different frequencies makes it through the atmosphere, you&#8217;ll see why:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Atmospheric_Transmission.png"><br />
<img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ecological/atmospheric_transmission.png" /></a>
</div>
<p>Everything here is a function of the wavelength, measured in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micrometre">micrometers</a>.    The smooth red curve is the Planck distribution for light coming from the Sun at a temperature of 5325 K.  Most of it is visible light, with a wavelength between 0.4 and 0.7 micrometers.  The jagged red region shows how much of this gets through&#8212;on a clear day, I assume&#8212;and you can see that most of it gets through.   The smooth bluish curves are the Planck distributions for light coming from the Earth at various temperatures between 210 K and 310 K.  Most of it is infrared light, and not much of it gets through.  </p>
<p><i>This, in a nutshell, is what keeps the Earth warmer than the chilly -18 &deg;C we got last time for an Earth with no atmosphere!</i>  </p>
<p>This is the <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect">greenhouse effect</a></b>.  As you can see, the absorption of infrared light is mainly due to water vapor, and then carbon dioxide, and then other lesser greenhouse gases, mainly methane, nitrous oxide.   Oxygen and ozone also play a minor role, but ozone is more important in blocking ultraviolet light.  Rayleigh scattering&#8212;the scattering of light by small particles, including molecules and atoms&#8212;is also important at short wavelengths, because its strength is proportional to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2F%5Clambda%5E4.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="1/&#92;lambda^4." class="latex" />  This is why the sky is blue!</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering"><img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ecological/rayleigh_sunlight_scattering.png" /></a></div>
<p>Here the wavelengths are measured in nanometers; there are 1000 nanometers in a micrometer.  Rayleigh scattering continues to become more important in the ultraviolet.</p>
<p>But right now I want to talk about the infrared.  As you can see, the all-important absorption of infrared radiation by water vapor and carbon dioxide is quite complicated.  You need quantum mechanics to predict how this works from first principles.  Tim van Beek gave a gentle introduction to some of the key ideas here:</p>

<p>Someday it would be fun to get into the details.  Not today, though!</p>
<p>You can see what&#8217;s going on a bit more clearly here:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Atmosfaerisk_spredning.gif"><br />
<img width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ecological/atmospheric_transmission.gif" /></a>
</div>
<p>The key fact is that infrared is almost completely absorbed for wavelengths between 5.5 and 7 micrometers, or over 14 micrometers.  (A &#8216;micron&#8217; is just an old name for a micrometer.)</p>
<h3> The work of Simpson </h3>
<p>The first person to give a reasonably successful explanation of how the power of radiation emitted by the Earth balances the power of the sunlight it absorbs was George Simpson.  He did it in 1928:</p>
<p>&bull; George C. Simpson, <a href="http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/056/mwr-056-08-0322.pdf">Further studies in terrestrial radiation</a>, <i>Mem. Roy. Meteor. Soc.</i> <b>3</b> (1928), 1&#8211;26. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.aos.princeton.edu/WWWPUBLIC/gkv/history/Simpson-studies27.pdf">One year earlier</a>, he had tried and failed to understand this problem using a &#8216;gray atmosphere&#8217; model where the fraction of light that gets through was independent of its wavelength.  If you&#8217;ve been paying attention, I think you can see why that didn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>In 1928, since he didn&#8217;t have a computer, he made a simple model that treated emission of infrared radiation as follows.  </p>
<p>He treated the atmosphere as made of layers of varying thickness, each layer containing 0.03 grams per centimeter<sup>2</sup> of water vapor.  The Earth&#8217;s surface radiates infrared almost as a black body.  Part of the power is absorbed by the first layer above the surface, while some makes it through.  The first layer then re-radiates at the same wavelengths at a rate determined by its temperature.  Half this goes downward, while half goes up.  Of the part going upward, some is absorbed by the next layer&#8230; and so on, up to the top layer.  He took this top layer to end at the stratosphere, since the atmosphere is much drier in the stratosphere.  </p>
<p>He did this all in a way that depends on the wavelength, but using a simplified model of how each of these layers absorbs infrared light.  He assumed it was:</p>
<p>&bull; completely opaque from 5.5 to 7 micrometers (due to water vapor),</p>
<p>&bull; partly transparent from 7 to 8.5 micrometers (interpolating between opaque and transparent),</p>
<p>&bull; completely transparent from 8.5 to 11 micrometers,</p>
<p>&bull; partly transparent from 11 to 14 micrometers (interpolating between transparent and opaque),</p>
<p>&bull; completely opaque above 14 micrometers (due to carbon dioxide and water vapor).</p>
<p>He got this result, at the latitude 50&deg; on a clear day:</p>
<div align="center"><a href=""><br />
<img src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ecological/simpson_outgoing_radiation.jpg" /></a>
</div>
<p>The upper smooth curve is the Planck distribution for a temperature of 280 K, corresponding to the ground.  The lower smooth curve is the Planck distribution at 218 K, corresponding to the stratosphere.  The shaded region is his calculation of the monochromatic flux emitted into space by the Earth.  As you can see, it matches the Planck distribution for the stratosphere where the lower atmosphere is completely opaque in his model&#8212;between 5.5 and 7 micrometers, and over 14 micrometers.  It matches the Planck distribution for the stratosphere where the lower atmosphere is completely transparent.  Elsewhere, it interpolates between the two.  </p>
<p>The area of this shaded region&#8212;calculated with a planimeter, perhaps?&#8212;is the total flux emitted into space.</p>
<p>This is just part of the story: he also took clouds into account, and he did different calculations at different latitudes.   He got a reasonably good balance between the incoming and outgoing power.  In short, he showed that an Earth with its observed temperatures is roughly compatible with his model of how the Earth absorbs and emits radiation.   Note that this is just another way to tackle the problem of <i>predicting</i> the temperature <i>given</i> a model. </p>
<p>Also note that Simpson didn&#8217;t quite use the Schwarzschild equation.  But I guess that in some sense he discretized it&#8212;right?</p>
<h3> And so on </h3>
<p>This was just the beginning of a series of more and more sophisticated models.   I&#8217;m too tired to go on right now.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll note one big thing we&#8217;ve omitted: any sort of calculation of how the pressure, temperature and humidity of the air varies with altitude!  To the extent we talked about those at all, we treated them as <i>inputs</i>.  But for a full-fledged one-dimensional model of the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere, we&#8217;d want to <i>derive</i> them from some principles.  There are, after all, some important puzzles:</p>
<p><b>Puzzle 4.</b>  If hot air rises, why does the atmosphere generally get colder as you go upward, at least until you reach the stratosphere?</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://www.srh.noaa.gov/jetstream/atmos/atmprofile.htm"><img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ecological/atmosphere_temperature_profile.jpg" /></a></div>
<p><b>Puzzle 5.</b>  Why is there a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropopause">tropopause</a>? In other words, why is there a fairly sudden transition 10 kilometers up between the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troposphere">troposphere</a>, where the air is moist, cooler the higher you go, and turbulent, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere">stratosphere</a>, where the air is drier, warmer the higher you go, and not turbulent?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a limit to how much we can understand these puzzles using a 1-dimensional model, but we should at least <i>try</i> to make a model of a thin column of air with pressure, temperature and humidity varying as a function of altitude, with sunlight streaming downward and infrared radiation generally going up.  If we can&#8217;t do that, we&#8217;ll never understand more complicated things, like the actual atmosphere.</p>

<h3> Climate models </h3>
<p>Though it&#8217;s not my central concern in this class, we should talk a little about climate models.</p>
<p>There are many levels of sophistication when it comes to climate models.  It is wise to start with simple, not very realistic models before ascending to complicated, supposedly more realistic ones.  This is true in every branch of math or physics: working with simple models gives you insights that are crucial for correctly handling more complicated models.  You shouldn&#8217;t fly a fighter jet if you haven&#8217;t tried something simpler yet, like a bicycle: you&#8217;ll probably crash and burn.</p>
<p>As I mentioned <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/math_environment/math_environment_1.pdf">last time</a>, models in biology, ecology and climate science pose new challenges compared to models of the simpler systems that physicists like best.  As Chris Lee emphasizes, biology inherently deals with &#8216;high data&#8217; systems where the relevant information can rarely be captured in a few variables, or even a few field equations.  </p>
<p>(Field theories involve infinitely many variables, but somehow the ones physicists like best allow us to make a small finite number of measurements and extract a prediction from them!  It would be nice to understand this more formally.  In quantum field theory, the &#8216;nice&#8217; field theories are called &#8216;renormalizable&#8217;, but a similar issue shows up classically, as we&#8217;ll see in a second.)</p>
<p>The climate system is in part a system that feels like &#8216;physics&#8217;: the flow of air in the atmosphere and water in the ocean.  But some of the equations here, for example the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations">Navier&#8211;Stokes equations</a>, are already &#8216;nasty&#8217; by the standards of mathematical physics, since the existence of solutions over long periods of time has not been proved.  This is related to &#8216;turbulence&#8217;, a process where information at one length scale can significantly affect information at another dramatically different length scale, making precise predictions difficult.  </p>
<p>Climate prediction is, we hope and believe, somewhat insulated from the challenges of weather prediction: we can hope to know the average temperature of the Earth within a degree or two in 5 years even though we don&#8217;t know whether it will rain in Manhattan on October 8, 2017.  But this hope is something that needs to be studied, not something we can take for granted.</p>
<p>On top of this, the climate is, quite crucially, a <i>biological</i> system.  Plant and animal life really affects the climate, as well as being affected by it.   So, for example, a really detailed climate model may have a portion specially devoted to the behavior of plankton in the Mediterranean.  This means that climate models will never be as &#8216;neat and clean&#8217; as physicists and mathematicians tend to want&#8212;at least, not if these models are trying to be truly realistic.  And as I suggested last time, this general type of challenge&#8212;the challenge posed by biosystems too complex to precisely model&#8212;may ultimately push mathematics in very new directions.  </p>
<p>I call this <font color="green">green mathematics</font>, without claiming I know what it will be like.  The term is mainly an incitement to think big.  I wrote a little about it <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/networks_1.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>However, being a bit of an old-fashioned mathematician myself, I&#8217;ll start by talking about some very simple climate models, gradually leading up to some interesting puzzles about the &#8216;ice ages&#8217; or, more properly, &#8216;glacial cycles&#8217; that have been pestering the Earth for the last 20 million years or so.  First, though, let&#8217;s take a quick look at the hierarchy of different climate models.</p>
<h3> Different kinds of climate models </h3>
<p>&bull; <b>Zero-dimensional models</b> are like theories of classical mechanics instead of classical field theory.  In other words, they only consider with globally averaged quantities, like the average temperature of the Earth, or perhaps regionally averaged quantities, like the average temperature of each ocean and each continent.   This sounds silly, but it&#8217;s a great place to start.  It amounts to dealing with finitely many variables depending on time:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x_1%28t%29%2C+%5Cdots+x_n%28t%29%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(x_1(t), &#92;dots x_n(t))" class="latex" /></p>
<p>We might assume these obey a differential equation, which we can always make first-order by introducing extra variables:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7Bd+x_i%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D+f_i%28t%2C+x_1%28t%29%2C+%5Cdots%2C+x_n%28t%29%29++%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{d x_i}{d t} = f_i(t, x_1(t), &#92;dots, x_n(t))  } " class="latex" /> </p>
<p>This kind of model is studied quite generally in the subject of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_systems_theory">dynamical systems theory</a>.</p>
<p>In particular, <b><a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Energy+balance+model">energy balance models</a></b> try to predict the average surface temperature of the Earth depending on the energy flow.  Energy comes in from the Sun and is radiated to outer space by the Earth. What happens in between is modeled by averaged feedback equations.</p>
<p>The Earth has various approximately conserved quantities like the total amount of carbon, or oxygen, or nitrogen&#8212;radioactive decay creates and destroys these elements, but it&#8217;s pretty negligible in climate physics.  So, these things move around from one form to another.  We can imagine a model where some of our variables <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_i%28t%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x_i(t)" class="latex" /> are the amounts of carbon in the air, or in the soil, or in the ocean&#8212;different &#8216;boxes&#8217;, abstractly speaking.   It will flow from one box to another in a way that depends on various other variables in our model.   This idea gives class of models called <b><a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Box+model">box models</a></b>.   </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s one described by Nathan Urban in <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week304.html">&#8220;week304&#8221;</a> of This Week&#8217;s Finds:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week304.html"><img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/nathan_urban_model.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>I&#8217;m interested in box models because they&#8217;re a simple example of &#8216;networked systems&#8217;: we&#8217;ve got boxes hooked up by wires, or pipes, and we can imagine a big complicated model formed by gluing together smaller models, attaching the wires from one to the wires of another.  We can use category theory to formalize this.  In category theory we&#8217;d call these smaller models &#8216;morphisms&#8217;, and the process of gluing them together is called &#8216;composing&#8217; them.   I&#8217;ll talk about this a lot more someday.</p>
<p>&bull;  <b>One-dimensional models</b> treat temperature and perhaps other quantities as a function of one spatial coordinate (in addition to time): for example, the altitude.  This lets us include one dimensional processes of heat transport in the model, like radiation and (a very simplified model of) convection.</p>
<p>&bull; <b>Two-dimensional models</b> treat temperature and other quantities as a function of two spatial coordinates (and time): for example, altitude and latitude.  Alternatively, we could treat the atmosphere as a thin layer and think of temperature at some fixed altitude as a function of latitude and longitude!</p>
<p>&bull;  <b>Three-dimensional models</b> treat temperature and other quantities as a function of all three spatial coordinates.  At this point we can, if we like, use the full-fledged Navier&#8211;Stokes equations to describe the motion of air in the atmosphere and water in the ocean.  Needless to say, these models can become very complex and computation-intensive, depending on how many effects we want to take into account and at what resolution we wish to model the atmosphere and ocean.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/General+circulation+model">General circulation models</a></b> or <b>GCMs</b> try to model the circulation of the atmosphere and/or ocean.  </p>
<p><b>Atmospheric GCMs</b> or AGCMs model the atmosphere and typically contain a land-surface model, while imposing some boundary conditions describing sea surface temperatures.   <b>Oceanic GCMs</b> or OGCMs model the ocean (with fluxes from the atmosphere imposed) and may or may not contain a sea ice model.   <b>Coupled atmosphere–ocean GCMs</b> or AOGCMs do both atmosphere and ocean.  These the basis for detailed predictions of future climate, such as are discussed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/organization/organization.shtml#.UHTT01ElqSo">IPCC</a>.   </p>
<p>&bull;  Backing down a bit, we can consider <b><a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Earth+model+of+intermediate+complexity">Earth models of intermediate complexity</a></b> or EMICs.  These might have a 3-dimensional atmosphere and a 2-dimensional &#8216;slab ocean&#8217;, or a 3d ocean and an energy-moisture balance atmosphere.  </p>
<p>&bull; Alternatively, we can consider <b>regional circulation models</b> or RCMs.  These are limited-area models that can be run at higher resolution than the GCMs and are thus able to better represent fine-grained phenomena, including processes resulting from finer-scale topographic and land-surface features.  Typically the regional atmospheric model is run while receiving lateral boundary condition inputs from a relatively-coarse resolution atmospheric analysis model or from the output of a GCM.  As Michael Knap pointed out in class, there&#8217;s again something from network theory going on here: we are &#8216;gluing in&#8217; the RCM into a &#8216;hole&#8217; cut out of a GCM.</p>
<p>Modern GCMs as used in the <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/publications_ipcc_fourth_assessment_report_wg1_report_the_physical_science_basis.htm">2007 IPCC report</a> tended to run around 100-kilometer resolution.  Individual clouds can only start to be resolved at about 10 kilometers or below.  One way to deal with this is to take the output of higher resolution <i>regional</i> climate models and use it to adjust parameters, etcetera, in GCMs.</p>
<h3> The hierarchy of climate models </h3>
<p>The climate scientist Isaac Held has a great article about the hierarchy of climate models:</p>
<p>&bull; Isaac Held, <a href="http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/bibliography/related_files/ih0501.pdf">The gap between simulation and understanding in climate modeling</a>, <i>Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society</i> (November 2005), 1609&#8211;1614.</p>
<p>In it, he writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The importance of such a hierarchy for climate modeling and studies of atmospheric and oceanic dynamics has often been emphasized. See, for example, Schneider and Dickinson (1974), and, especially, Hoskins (1983). But, despite notable exceptions in a few subfields, climate theory has not, in my opinion, been very successful at hierarchy construction. I do not mean to imply that important work has not been performed, of course, but only that the gap between comprehensive climate models and more idealized models has not been successfully closed.</p>
<p>Consider, by analogy, another field that must deal with exceedingly complex systems—molecular biology. How is it that biologists have made such dramatic and steady progress in sorting out the human genome and the interactions of the thousands of proteins of which we are constructed? Without doubt, one key has been that nature has provided us with a hierarchy of biological systems of increasing complexity that are amenable to experimental manipulation, ranging from bacteria to fruit fly to mouse to man. Furthermore, the nature of evolution assures us that much of what we learn from simpler organisms is directly relevant to deciphering the workings of their more complex relatives. What good fortune for biologists to be presented with precisely the kind of hierarchy needed to understand a complex system! Imagine how much progress would have been made if they were limited to studying man alone.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Nature has not provided us with simpler climate systems that form such a beautiful hierarchy. Planetary atmospheres provide insights into the range of behaviors that are possible, but the known planetary atmospheres are few, and each has its own idiosyncrasies. Their study has connected to terrestrial climate theory on occasion, but the influence has not been systematic. Laboratory simulations of rotating and/or convecting fluids remain valuable and underutilized, but they cannot address our most complex problems. We are left with the necessity of constructing our own hierarchies of climate models.</p>
<p>Because nature has provided the biological hierarchy, it is much easier to focus the attention of biologists on a few representatives of the key evolutionary steps toward greater complexity. And, such a focus is central to success. If every molecular biologist had simply studied his or her own favorite bacterium or insect, rather than focusing so intensively on <i>E. coli</i> or <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, it is safe to assume that progress would have been far less rapid. </p>
<p>It is emblematic of our problem that studying the biological hierarchy is experimental science, while constructing and studying climate hierarchies is theoretical science. A biologist need not convince her colleagues that the model organism she is advocating for intensive study is well designed or well posed, but only that it fills an important niche in the hierarchy of complexity and that it is convenient for study. Climate theorists are faced with the difficult task of both constructing a hierarchy of models and somehow focusing the attention of the community on a few of these models so that our efforts accumulate efficiently. Even if one believes that one has defined the <i>E. coli</i> of climate models, it is difficult to energize (and fund) a significant number of researchers to take this model seriously and devote years to its study.</p>
<p>And yet, despite the extra burden of trying to create a consensus as to what the appropriate climate model hierarchies are, the construction of such hierarchies must, I believe, be a central goal of climate theory in the twenty-first century. There are no alternatives if we want to understand the climate system and our<br />
comprehensive climate models. Our understanding will be embedded within these hierarchies.
</p></blockquote>
<p>It is possible that mathematicians, with a lot of training from climate scientists, have the sort of patience and delight in &#8216;study for study&#8217;s sake&#8217; to study this hierarchy of models.  Here&#8217;s one that Held calls &#8216;the fruit fly of climate models&#8217;:</p>

<h3> The very simplest model </h3>
<p>The very simplest model is a zero-dimensional energy balance model.  In this model we treat the Earth as having just one degree of freedom&#8212;its temperature&#8212;and we treat it as a blackbody in equilibrium with the radiation coming from the Sun.</p>
<p>A <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_body">black body</a></b> is an object that perfectly absorbs and therefore also perfectly emits all electromagnetic radiation at all frequencies.  Real bodies don&#8217;t have this property; instead, they absorb radiation at certain frequencies better than others, and some not at all. But there are materials that do come rather close to a black body. Usually one adds another assumption to the characterization of an ideal black body: namely, that the <i>radiation is independent of the direction</i>.</p>
<p>When the black body has a certain temperature <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T," class="latex" /> it will emit electromagnetic radiation, so it will send out a certain amount of energy per second for every square meter of surface area.  We will call this the <b>energy flux</b> and denote this as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f." class="latex" />  The SI unit for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" /> is W/m<sup>2</sup>: that is, watts per square meter.   Here the <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt">watt</a></b> is a unit of energy per time.</p>
<p>Electromagnetic radiation comes in different wavelengths.  So, can ask how much energy flux our black body emits per change in wavelength.  This depends on the wavelength.  We will call this the <b>monochromatic energy flux</b> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%7B%5Clambda%7D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_{&#92;lambda}." class="latex" />  The SI unit for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%7B%5Clambda%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_{&#92;lambda}" class="latex" /> is W/m<sup>2</sup>&mu;m, where &mu;m stands for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micrometre"><b>micrometer</b></a>: a millionth of a meter, which is a unit of wavelength.  We call <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%5Clambda&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_&#92;lambda" class="latex" /> the &#8216;monochromatic&#8217; energy flux because it gives a number for any fixed wavelength <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;lambda." class="latex" /> When we integrate the monochromatic energy flux over all wavelengths, we get the energy flux <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f." class="latex" /></p>
<p>Max Planck was able to calculate <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%7B%5Clambda%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_{&#92;lambda}" class="latex" /> for a blackbody at temperature <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T," class="latex" /> but only by inventing a bit of quantum mechanics.  His result is called the <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_law">Planck distribution</a></b>: if</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+f_%7B%5Clambda%7D%28T%29+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B2+hc%5E2%7D%7B%5Clambda%5E5%7D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B+e%5E%7B%5Cfrac%7Bhc%7D%7B%5Clambda+k+T%7D%7D+-+1+%7D+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ f_{&#92;lambda}(T) = &#92;frac{2 hc^2}{&#92;lambda^5} &#92;frac{1}{ e^{&#92;frac{hc}{&#92;lambda k T}} - 1 } } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="h" class="latex" /> is Planck&#8217;s constant, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c" class="latex" /> is the speed of light, and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" /> is Boltzmann&#8217;s constant.  Deriving this would be tons of fun, but also a huge digression from the point of this class.</p>
<p>You can integrate <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%5Clambda&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_&#92;lambda" class="latex" /> over all wavelengths <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;lambda" class="latex" /> to get the total energy flux&#8212;that is, the total power per square meter emitted by a blackbody.  The answer is surprisingly simple: if the total energy flux is defined by</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7Bf+%3D+%5Cint_0%5E%5Cinfty+f_%7B%5Clambda%7D%28T%29+%5C%2C+d+%5Clambda+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{f = &#92;int_0^&#92;infty f_{&#92;lambda}(T) &#92;, d &#92;lambda } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>then in fact we can do the integral and get</p>

<p>for some constant <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csigma.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;sigma." class="latex" /> This fact is called the <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan-Boltzmann_law">Stefan&#8211;Boltzmann law</a></b>, and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csigma&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;sigma" class="latex" /> is called the <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan-Boltzmann_constant">Stefan-Boltzmann constant</a></b>:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Csigma%3D%5Cfrac%7B2%5Cpi%5E5+k%5E4%7D%7B15c%5E2h%5E3%7D+%5Capprox+5.67+%5Ctimes+10%5E%7B-8%7D%5C%2C+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cmathrm%7BW%7D%7D%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bm%7D%5E2+%5Cmathrm%7BK%7D%5E4%7D+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;sigma=&#92;frac{2&#92;pi^5 k^4}{15c^2h^3} &#92;approx 5.67 &#92;times 10^{-8}&#92;, &#92;frac{&#92;mathrm{W}}{&#92;mathrm{m}^2 &#92;mathrm{K}^4} } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Using this formula, we can assign to every energy flux <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" /> a black body temperature <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T," class="latex" /> which is the temperature that an ideal black body would need to have to emit <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f." class="latex" /></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s use this to calculate the temperature of the Earth in this simple model!    A planet like Earth gets energy from the Sun and loses energy by radiating to space. Since the Earth sits in empty space, these two processes are the only relevant ones that describe the energy flow. </p>
<p>The sunshine near Earth carries an energy flux of about 1370 watts per square meter.  If the temperature of the Earth is constant, as much energy is coming in as going out.   So, we might try to balance the incoming energy flux with the outgoing flux of a blackbody at temperature <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T" class="latex" />:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+1370+%5C%2C+%5Ctextrm%7BW%7D%2F%5Ctextrm%7Bm%7D%5E2+%3D+%5Csigma+T%5E4+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ 1370 &#92;, &#92;textrm{W}/&#92;textrm{m}^2 = &#92;sigma T^4 }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>and then solve for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T" class="latex" />:</p>

<p>We&#8217;re making a big mistake here.  Do you see what it is?  But let&#8217;s go ahead and see what we get.  As mentioned, the Stefan&#8211;Boltzmann constant has a value of </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Csigma+%5Capprox+5.67+%5Ctimes+10%5E%7B-8%7D+%5C%2C+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cmathrm%7BW%7D%7D%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bm%7D%5E2+%5Cmathrm%7BK%7D%5E4%7D++%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;sigma &#92;approx 5.67 &#92;times 10^{-8} &#92;, &#92;frac{&#92;mathrm{W}}{&#92;mathrm{m}^2 &#92;mathrm{K}^4}  } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>so we get</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+T+%3D+%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7B1370%7D%7B5.67+%5Ctimes+10%5E%7B-8%7D%7D+%5Cright%29%5E%7B1%2F4%7D+%5Cmathrm%7BK%7D+%7D++%5Capprox+%282.4+%5Ccdot+10%5E9%29%5E%7B1%2F4%7D+%5Cmathrm%7BK%7D+%5Capprox+394+%5Cmathrm%7BK%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ T = &#92;left(&#92;frac{1370}{5.67 &#92;times 10^{-8}} &#92;right)^{1/4} &#92;mathrm{K} }  &#92;approx (2.4 &#92;cdot 10^9)^{1/4} &#92;mathrm{K} &#92;approx 394 &#92;mathrm{K} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>This is much too hot!  Remember, this temperature is in kelvin, so we need to subtract 273 to get Celsius.  Doing so, we get a temperature of 121 &deg;C.  This is above the boiling point of water!</p>
<p>Do you see what we did wrong?  We neglected a phenomenon known as <i>night</i>.  The Earth emits infrared radiation in all directions, but it only absorbs sunlight on the daytime side.  Our calculation would be correct if the Earth were a flat disk of perfectly black stuff facing the Sun and <i>perfectly insulated on the back</i> so that it could only emit infrared radiation over the same area that absorbs sunlight!  But in fact emission takes place over a larger area than absorption.  This makes the Earth cooler.</p>
<p>To get the right answer, we need to take into account the fact that the Earth is round.  But just for fun, let&#8217;s see how well a flat Earth theory does.  A few climate skeptics may even believe this theory.  Suppose the Earth were a flat disk of radius <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r," class="latex" /> made of black stuff facing the Sun but <i>not</i> insulated on back.  Then it would absorb power equal to</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1370+%5Ccdot+%5Cpi+r%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="1370 &#92;cdot &#92;pi r^2" class="latex" /> </p>
<p>since the area of the disk is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi+r%5E2%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;pi r^2," class="latex" /> but it would emit power equal to</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csigma+T%5E4+%5Ccdot+2+%5Cpi+r%5E2+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;sigma T^4 &#92;cdot 2 &#92;pi r^2 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>since it emits from both the front and back.  Setting these equal, we now get</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7B1370%7D%7B2%7D+%5Ctextrm%7BW%7D%2F%5Ctextrm%7Bm%7D%5E2+%3D+%5Csigma+T%5E4+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{1370}{2} &#92;textrm{W}/&#92;textrm{m}^2 = &#92;sigma T^4 }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+T+%3D+%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7B1370+%5Ctextrm%7BW%7D%2F%5Ctextrm%7Bm%7D%5E2%7D%7B2+%5Csigma%7D%5Cright%29%5E%7B1%2F4%7D+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ T = &#92;left(&#92;frac{1370 &#92;textrm{W}/&#92;textrm{m}^2}{2 &#92;sigma}&#92;right)^{1/4} }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>This reduces the temperature by a factor of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B-1%2F4%7D+%5Capprox+0.84&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="2^{-1/4} &#92;approx 0.84" class="latex" /> from our previous estimate.  So now the temperature works out to be less:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0.84+%5Ccdot+394+%5Cmathrm%7BK%7D+%5Capprox+331+%5Cmathrm%7BK%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="0.84 &#92;cdot 394 &#92;mathrm{K} &#92;approx 331 &#92;mathrm{K} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>But this is still too hot!  It&#8217;s 58 &deg;C, or 136 &deg;F for you Americans out there who don&#8217;t have a good intuition for Celsius. </p>
<p>So, a flat black Earth facing the Sun would be a very hot Earth.</p>
<p>But now let&#8217;s stop goofing around and do the calculation with a round Earth.  Now it absorbs a beam of sunlight with area equal to its cross-section, a circle of area <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi+r%5E2.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;pi r^2." class="latex" />  But it emits infrared over its whole area of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=4+%5Cpi+r%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="4 &#92;pi r^2" class="latex" />: four times as much.   So now we get  </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+T+%3D+%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7B1370+%5Ctextrm%7BW%7D%2F%5Ctextrm%7Bm%7D%5E2%7D%7B4+%5Csigma%7D%5Cright%29%5E%7B1%2F4%7D+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ T = &#92;left(&#92;frac{1370 &#92;textrm{W}/&#92;textrm{m}^2}{4 &#92;sigma}&#92;right)^{1/4} }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>so the temperature is reduced by a further factor of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B-1%2F4%7D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="2^{-1/4}." class="latex" />  We get</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0.84+%5Ccdot+331+%5Cmathrm%7BK%7D+%5Capprox+279+%5Cmathrm%7BK%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="0.84 &#92;cdot 331 &#92;mathrm{K} &#92;approx 279 &#92;mathrm{K} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>That&#8217;s 6 &deg;C.   Not bad for a crude approximation!  Amusingly, it&#8217;s crucial that the area of a sphere is 4 times the area of a circle of the same radius.   The question if there is some deeper reason for this simple relation was posed as a <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/10/11/geometry-puzzle/">geometry puzzle</a> here on Azimuth.</p>
<p>I hope my clowning around hasn&#8217;t distracted you from the main point.  On average our simplified blackbody Earth absorbs 1370/4 = 342.5  watts of solar power per square meter.  So, that&#8217;s how much infrared radiation it has to emit.  If you can imagine how much heat a 60-watt bulb puts out when it&#8217;s surrounded by black paper, we&#8217;re saying our simplified Earth emits about 6 times that heat per square meter.</p>
<h3> The second simplest climate model </h3>
<p>The next step is to take into account the &#8216;albedo&#8217; of the Earth. The <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo">albedo</a></b> is the fraction of radiation that is instantly reflected without being absorbed. The albedo of a surface does depend on the material of the surface, and in particular on the wavelength of the radiation, of course. But in a first approximation for the average albedo of earth we can take:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7Balbedo%7D_%7B%5Cmathrm%7BEarth%7D%7D+%3D+0.3+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{albedo}_{&#92;mathrm{Earth}} = 0.3 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>This means that 30% of the radiation is instantly reflected and only 70% contributes to heating earth.   So, instead of getting heated by an average of 342.5 watts per square meter of sunlight, let&#8217;s assume it&#8217;s heated by</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0.7+%5Ctimes+342.5+%5Capprox+240+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="0.7 &#92;times 342.5 &#92;approx 240 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>watts per square meter.  Now we get a temperature of </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+T+%3D+%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7B240%7D%7B5.67+%5Ctimes+10%5E%7B-8%7D%7D+%5Cright%29%5E%7B1%2F4%7D+K+%7D++%5Capprox+%284.2+%5Ccdot+10%5E9%29%5E%7B1%2F4%7D+K+%5Capprox+255+K+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ T = &#92;left(&#92;frac{240}{5.67 &#92;times 10^{-8}} &#92;right)^{1/4} K }  &#92;approx (4.2 &#92;cdot 10^9)^{1/4} K &#92;approx 255 K " class="latex" /></p>
<p>This is -18 &deg;C.  The average temperature of earth is actually estimated to be considerably warmer: about +15 &deg;C.  This should not be a surprise: after all, 70% of the planet is covered by liquid water! This is an indication that the average temperature is most probably not below the freezing point of water.  </p>
<p>So, our new &#8216;improved&#8217; calculation gives a <i>worse</i> agreement with reality.  The actual Earth is roughly 33 kelvin warmer than our model Earth!  What&#8217;s wrong?  </p>
<p>The main explanation for the discrepancy seems to be: our model Earth doesn&#8217;t have an atmosphere yet!   Thanks in part to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas">greenhouse gases</a> like water vapor and carbon dioxide, sunlight at visible frequencies can get into the atmosphere more easily than infrared radiation can get out.  This warms the Earth.  This, in a nutshell, is why dumping a lot of extra carbon dioxide into the air can change our climate.  But of course we&#8217;ll need to turn to more detailed models, or experimental data, to see how strong this effect is.</p>
<p>Besides the greenhouse effect, there are many other things our ultra-simplified model leaves out: everything associated to the atmosphere and oceans, such as weather, clouds, the altitude-dependence of the temperature of the atmosphere&#8230; and also the way the albedo of the Earth depends on location and even on temperature and other factors.   There is much <i>much</i> more to say about all this&#8230; but not today!</p>

<h3> Introduction </h3>
<p>Thermodynamical dissipation and adaptive evolution are two faces of the same Markovian coin!</p>
<p>Consider this. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics">Second Law of Thermodynamics</a> states that the entropy of an isolated thermodynamic system can never decrease; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landauer%27s_principle">Landauer&#8217;s principle</a> maintains that the erasure of information inevitably causes dissipation; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%27s_fundamental_theorem_of_natural_selection">Fisher&#8217;s fundamental theorem of natural selection</a> asserts that any fitness difference within a population leads to adaptation in an evolution process governed by natural selection. Diverse as they are, these statements have two common characteristics: </p>
<p>1. they express the <i>irreversibility</i> of certain natural phenomena, and </p>
<p>2. the dynamical processes underlying these phenomena involve an element of <i>randomness</i>. </p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t this suggest to you the following question: Could it be that thermal phenomena, forgetful information processing and adaptive evolution are governed by <i>the same stochastic mechanism?</i> </p>
<p>The answer is—yes! The key to this rather profound connection resides in a universal property of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_process">Markov processes</a> discovered recently in the context of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, and known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluctuation_theorem">&#8216;fluctuation theorem&#8217;</a>. Typically stated in terms of &#8216;dissipated work&#8217; or &#8216;entropy production&#8217;, this result can be seen as an extension of the Second Law of Thermodynamics to <i>small</i> systems, where thermal fluctuations cannot be neglected. But <i>it is actually much more than this</i>: it is the mathematical underpinning of irreversibility itself, be it thermodynamical, evolutionary, or else. To make this point clear, let me start by giving a general formulation of the fluctuation theorem that makes no reference to physics concepts such as &#8216;heat&#8217; or &#8216;work&#8217;.</p>
<h3> The mathematical fact </h3>
<p>Consider a system randomly jumping between states <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%2C+b%2C%5Cdots&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a, b,&#92;dots" class="latex" /> with (possibly time-dependent) transition rates <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma_%7Ba+b%7D%28t%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;gamma_{a b}(t)" class="latex" /> where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a" class="latex" /> is the state prior to the jump, while <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="b" class="latex" /> is the state after the jump. I&#8217;ll assume that this dynamics defines a (continuous-time) Markov process, namely that the numbers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma_%7Ba+b%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;gamma_{a b}" class="latex" /> are the matrix entries of an <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/networks_20.html">infinitesimal stochastic</a> matrix, which means that its off-diagonal entries are non-negative and that its columns sum up to zero. </p>

<h3> The physical and biological consequences </h3>
<p>Consider first the standard stochastic-thermodynamic scenario where a physical system is kept in contact with a thermal reservoir at inverse temperature <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta" class="latex" /> and undergoes thermally induced transitions between states <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%2C+b%2C%5Cdots&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a, b,&#92;dots" class="latex" />. By virtue of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detailed_balance"><b>detailed balance condition</b></a>:</p>

<p>the skewness <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csigma_%7Bj%7D%28%5Ctau_%7Bj%7D%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;sigma_{j}(&#92;tau_{j})" class="latex" /> of each such transition is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta " class="latex" /> times the energy difference between the states <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_%7Bj%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a_{j}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_%7Bj-1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a_{j-1}" class="latex" />, namely the <i>heat</i> received from the reservoir during the transition. Hence, the mean cumulative skewness <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5CSigma%5Crangle&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;langle &#92;Sigma&#92;rangle" class="latex" /> is nothing but <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta%5Clangle+Q%5Crangle%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta&#92;langle Q&#92;rangle," class="latex" /> with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Q" class="latex" /> the total heat received by the system along the process. It follows from the detailed fluctuation theorem that </p>

<p>which is of course <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clausius_theorem">Clausius&#8217; inequality</a>. In a computational context where the control parameter is the entropy variation itself (such as in a bit-erasure protocol, where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CDelta+S%3D-%5Cln+2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;Delta S=-&#92;ln 2" class="latex" />), this inequality in turn expresses Landauer&#8217;s principle: it impossible to decrease the self-information of the system&#8217;s state without dissipating a minimal amount of heat into the environment (in this case <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=-Q+%5Cgeq+k+T%5Cln2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="-Q &#92;geq k T&#92;ln2" class="latex" />, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landauer%27s_principle">&#8216;Landauer bound&#8217;</a>). More general situations (several types of reservoirs, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell_demon">Maxwell-demon</a>-like feedback controls) can be treated along the same lines, and the various forms of the Second Law derived from the detailed fluctuation theorem. </p>
<p>Now, many would agree that evolutionary dynamics is a wholly different business from thermodynamics; in particular, notions such as &#8216;heat&#8217; or &#8216;temperature&#8217; are clearly irrelevant to Darwinian evolution. However, the stochastic framework of Markov processes <i>is</i> relevant to describe the genetic evolution of a population, and this fact alone has important consequences. As a simple example, consider the time evolution of mutant fixations <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Ba%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x_{a}" class="latex" /> in a population, with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a" class="latex" /> ranging over the possible genotypes. In a &#8216;symmetric mutation scheme&#8217;, which I understand is biological parlance for &#8216;reversible Markov process&#8217;, meaning one that obeys <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detailed_balance">detailed balance</a>, the ratio between the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%5Cmapsto+b&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a&#92;mapsto b" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b%5Cmapsto+a&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="b&#92;mapsto a" class="latex" /> transition rates is completely determined by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_landscape"><b>fitnesses</b></a> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%7Ba%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_{a}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_b&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_b" class="latex" /> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="b" class="latex" />, according to </p>

<p>shows that a positive fitness flux is &#8220;an almost universal evolutionary principle of biological systems&#8221; [Mustonen2010], with negative contributions limited to time intervals with a systematic loss of adaptation (<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CDelta+S+%3E+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;Delta S &gt; 0" class="latex" />). This statement may well be the closest thing to a version of the Second Law of Thermodynamics applying to evolutionary dynamics. </p>
<p>It is really quite remarkable that thermodynamical dissipation and Darwinian evolution can be reduced to the same stochastic mechanism, and that notions such as &#8216;fitness flux&#8217; and &#8216;heat&#8217; can arise as two faces of the same mathematical coin, namely the &#8216;skewness&#8217; of Markovian transitions. After all, the phenomenon of life is in itself a direct challenge to thermodynamics, isn&#8217;t it? When thermal phenomena tend to increase the world&#8217;s disorder, life strives to bring about and maintain exquisitely fine spatial and chemical structures&#8212;which is why Schr&ouml;dinger famously proposed to <i>define</i> life as <i>negative entropy</i>. Could there be a more striking confirmation of his intuition&#8212;and a reconciliation of evolution and thermodynamics in the same go&#8212;than the fundamental inequality of adaptive evolution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle%5CPhi%5Crangle%5Cgeq-%5CDelta+S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;langle&#92;Phi&#92;rangle&#92;geq-&#92;Delta S" class="latex" />?</p>
<p>Surely the detailed fluctuation theorem for Markov processes has other applications, pertaining neither to thermodynamics nor adaptive evolution. Can you think of any?</p>

<p>His derivation has long been considered obscure, even perhaps wrong, but apparently the theorem is now well accepted. I believe the first Markovian models of genetic evolution appeared here:</p>
<p>&bull; [Fisher1922]  R. A. Fisher, On the dominance ratio, <i>Proc. Roy. Soc. Edinb.</i> <b>42</b> (1922), 321&#8211;341.</p>
<p>&bull; [Wright1931]  S. Wright, Evolution in Mendelian populations, <i>Genetics</i> <b>16</b> (1931), 97&#8211;159.</p>

<p>Two of the key ideas for the &#8216;detailed fluctuation theorem&#8217; discussed here are due to Crooks: </p>

</div>
<p>I&#8217;m running a graduate math seminar called here at U. C. Riverside, and here are the slides for the first class:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/math_environment/math_environment_1.pdf">Mathematics of the Environment</a>, 2 October 2012. </p>
<p>I said a lot of things that aren&#8217;t on the slides, so they might be a tad cryptic.  I began by showing some graphs everyone should know by heart: </p>
<p>&bull; human population and the history of civilization, </p>
<p>&bull; the history of carbon emissions, </p>
<p>&bull; atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration for the last century or so, </p>
<p>&bull; global average temperatures for the last century or so, </p>
<p>&bull; the melting of the Arctic ice, and</p>
<p>&bull; the longer historical perspective of CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations.  </p>
<p>You can click on these graphs for more details&#8212;there are lots of links in the slides.</p>
<p>Then I posed the question of what mathematicians can do about this.  I suggested looking at the birth of written mathematics during the agricultural revolution as a good comparison, since we&#8217;re at the start of an equally big revolution now.   Have you thought about how Babylonian mathematics was intertwined with the agricultural revolution?</p>
<p>Then, I raised the idea of &#8216;ecotechnology&#8217; as a goal to strive for, assuming our current civilization doesn&#8217;t collapse to the point where it becomes pointless to even try.  As an example, I describe the perfect machine for reversing global warming&#8212;and show a nice picture of it.</p>
<p>Finally, I began sketching how ecotechnology is related to the mathematics of networks, though this will be a much longer story for later on.</p>
<p>Part of the idea here is that mathematics takes time to have an effect, so mathematicians might as well look ahead a little bit, while politicians, economists, business people and engineers should be doing things that have a big effect <i>soon</i>.  </p>
