					<p>A few years ago, after hearing <a href="http://statweb.stanford.edu/~susan/">Susan Holmes</a> speak about the mathematics of phylogenetic trees, I became interested in their connection to algebraic topology. I wrote an article about this here:</p>
<p>• John Baez, <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/07/06/operads-and-the-tree-of-life/">Operads and the tree of life</a>, 6 July 2011.</p>
<p>In trying to the make the ideas precise I recruited the help of <a href="https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/nina.otter">Nina Otter</a>, who was then a graduate student at ETH Zürich. She came to Riverside and we started to work together.</p>
<p>Now Nina is a grad student at Oxford working on mathematical biology with <a href="http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/harrington/">Heather Harrington</a>. I visited her last summer and we made more progress&#8230; but then she realized that our paper needed another big theorem, a result relating our topology on the space of phylogenetic trees to the topology described by Susan Holmes and her coauthors here:</p>
<p>• Louis J. Billera, Susan P. Holmes and Karen Vogtmann, <a href="http://finmath.stanford.edu/~susan/papers/lap.pdf">Geometry of the space of phylogenetic trees</a>, <i>Advances in Applied Mathematics</i> <b>27</b> (2001), 733&#8211;767.</p>
<p>It took another half year to finish things up. I could never have done this myself.</p>
<p>But now we&#8217;re done! Here&#8217;s our paper:</p>
<p>• John Baez and Nina Otter, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03337">Operads and phylogenetic trees</a>.</p>
<h3>The basic idea</h3>
<p>Trees are important, not only in mathematics, but also biology. The most important is the &#8216;tree of life&#8217; relating all organisms that have ever lived on Earth. Darwin drew this sketch of it in 1837:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ecological/phylo/darwin_tree.jpg" alt="" width="450" /></div>
<p>He wrote about it in <i>On the Origin of Species</i></p>
<blockquote><p>The affinities of all the beings of the same class have sometimes been represented by a great tree. I believe this simile largely speaks the truth. The green and budding twigs may represent existing species; and those produced during former years may represent the long succession of extinct species. At each period of growth all the growing twigs have tried to branch out on all sides, and to overtop and kill the surrounding twigs and branches, in the same manner as species and groups of species have at all times overmastered other species in the great battle for life.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now we know that the tree of life is not really a tree in the mathematical sense. One reason is &#8216;endosymbiosis&#8217;: the incorporation of one organism together with its genetic material into another, as probably happened with the mitochondria in our cells and also the plastids that hold chlorophyll in plants. Another is &#8216;horizontal gene transfer&#8217;: the passing of genetic material from one organism to another, which happens frequently with bacteria. So, the tree of life is really a thicket:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ecological/phylo/horizontal_gene_transfer.jpg" alt="" width="450" /></div>
<p>But a tree is often a good approximation, especially for animals and plants in the last few hundred million years. Biologists who try to infer phylogenetic trees from present-day genetic data often use simple models where:</p>
<p>• the genotype of each species follows a random walk, but</p>
<p>• species branch in two at various times.</p>
<p>These are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Models_of_DNA_evolution">&#8216;Markov models&#8217;</a>. The simplest Markov model for DNA evolution is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Models_of_DNA_evolution#JC69_model_.28Jukes_and_Cantor.2C_1969.29.5B1.5D">Jukes–Cantor model</a>. Consider one or more pieces of DNA having a total of <i>n</i> base pairs. We can think of this as a string of letters chosen from the set {A,T,C,G}:</p>
<div align="center">&#8230;ATCGATTGAGCTCTAGCG&#8230;</div>
<p>As time passes, the Jukes–Cantor model says the DNA changes randomly, with each base pair having the same constant rate of randomly flipping to any other. So, we get a Markov process on the set</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X+%3D+%5C%7B%5Ctextrm%7BA%2CT%2CC%2CG%7D%5C%7D%7B%7D%5EN+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X = &#92;{&#92;textrm{A,T,C,G}&#92;}{}^N " class="latex" /></p>
<p>However, a species can also split in two. So, given current-day genetic data from various species, biologists try to infer the most probable tree where, starting from a common ancestor, the DNA in question undergoes a random walk most of the time but branches in two at certain times.</p>
<p>To formalize this, we can define a concept of &#8216;phylogenetic tree&#8217;. Our work is based on the definition of <a href="http://finmath.stanford.edu/~susan/papers/lap.pdf">Billera, Holmes and Vogtmann</a>, though we use a slightly different definition, for reasons that will soon become clear. For us, a phylogenetic tree is a rooted tree with leaves labelled by numbers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2C2%2C+%5Cdots%2C+n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="1,2, &#92;dots, n" class="latex" /> and edges labelled by &#8216;times&#8217; or, geometrically speaking, &#8216;lengths&#8217; in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5B0%2C+%5Cinfty%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="[0, &#92;infty)." class="latex" /> We require that:</p>
<p>• the length of every edge is positive, except perhaps for &#8216;external edges&#8217;: that is, edges incident to the leaves or root;</p>
<p>• there are no 1-ary vertices.</p>
<p>For example, here is a phylogenetic tree with 5 leaves:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ecological/phylo/phylogenetic_tree.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cell_1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+%5Cell_6+%5Cge+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;ell_1, &#92;dots, &#92;ell_6 &#92;ge 0" class="latex" /> but we demand that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cell_7+%3E+0.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;ell_7 &gt; 0." class="latex" /> We draw the vertices as dots. We do not count the leaves and the root as vertices, and we label the root with the number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="0." class="latex" /> We cannot collapse edges of length zero that end at leaves, since doing so would eliminate those leaves. Also note that the embedding of the tree in the plane is irrelevant, so this counts as the same phylogenetic tree:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ecological/phylo/phylogenetic_tree_2.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p>In applications to biology, we are often interested in trees where the total distance from the root to the leaf is the same for every leaf, since all species have evolved for the same time from their common ancestor. These are mathematically interesting as well, because then the distance between any two leaves defines an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrametric_space">ultrametric</a> on the set of leaves. However, more general phylogenetic trees are also interesting—and they become essential when we construct an operad whose operations are phylogenetic trees.</p>
<p>Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BPhyl%7D_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Phyl}_n" class="latex" /> be the set of phylogenetic trees with <i>n</i> leaves. This has a natural topology, which we explain in Section 6 of our paper. For example, here is a continuous path in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BPhyl%7D_4&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Phyl}_4" class="latex" /> where we only change the length of one internal edge, reducing it until it becomes zero and we can collapse it:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ecological/phylo/path_of_phylogenetic_trees.jpg" alt="" width="450" /></div>
<p>Phylogenetic trees reconstructed by biologists are typically binary. When a phylogenetic tree appears to have higher arity, sometimes we merely lack sufficient data to resolve a higher-arity branching into a number of binary ones. With the topology we are using on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BPhyl%7D_n%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Phyl}_n," class="latex" /> binary trees form an open dense set of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BPhyl%7D_n%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Phyl}_n," class="latex" /> except for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BPhyl%7D_1.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Phyl}_1." class="latex" /> However, trees of higher arity are still important, because paths, paths of paths, etc. in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BPhyl%7D_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Phyl}_n" class="latex" /> are often forced to pass through trees of higher arity.</p>
<p>Billera, Holmes and Vogtmann focused their attention on the set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BT%7D_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathcal{T}_n" class="latex" /> of phylogenetic trees where lengths of the external edges&#8212;edges incident to the root and leaves&#8212;are fixed to a constant value. They endow <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BT%7D_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathcal{T}_n" class="latex" /> with a metric, which induces a topology on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BT%7D_n%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathcal{T}_n," class="latex" /> and there is a homeomorphism</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BPhyl%7D_n+%5Ccong+%5Cmathcal%7BT%7D_n+%5Ctimes+%5B0%2C%5Cinfty%29%5E%7Bn%2B1%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Phyl}_n &#92;cong &#92;mathcal{T}_n &#92;times [0,&#92;infty)^{n+1} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>where the data in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5B0%2C%5Cinfty%29%5E%7Bn%2B1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="[0,&#92;infty)^{n+1}" class="latex" /> describe the lengths of the external edges in a general phylogenetic tree.</p>
<p>In algebraic topology, trees are often used to describe the composition of <i>n</i>-ary operations. This is formalized in the theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operad_theory">operads</a>. An &#8216;operad&#8217; is an algebraic stucture where for each natural number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D0%2C1%2C2%2C%5Cdots&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n=0,1,2,&#92;dots" class="latex" /> we have a set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O_n" class="latex" /> whose elements are considered as abstract <i>n</i>-ary operations, not necessarily operating on anything yet. An element <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f+%5Cin+O_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f &#92;in O_n" class="latex" /> can be depicted as a planar tree with one vertex and <i>n</i> labelled leaves:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ecological/phylo/corolla.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p>We can compose these operations in a tree-like way to get new operations:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ecological/phylo/operad_composition.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p>and an associative law holds, making this sort of composite unambiguous:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ecological/phylo/operad_associativity.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p>There are various kinds of operads, but in this paper our operads will always be &#8216;unital&#8217;, having an operation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1+%5Cin+O_1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="1 &#92;in O_1" class="latex" /> that acts as an identity for composition. They will also be &#8216;symmetric&#8217;, meaning there is an action of the symmetric group <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S_n" class="latex" /> on each set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O_n%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O_n," class="latex" /> compatible with composition. Further, they will be &#8216;topological&#8217;, meaning that each set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O_n" class="latex" /> is a topological space, with composition and permutations acting as continuous maps.</p>
<p>In Section 5 we prove that there is an operad <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BPhyl%7D%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Phyl}," class="latex" /> the &#8216;phylogenetic operad&#8217;, whose space of <i>n</i>-ary operations is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BPhyl%7D_n.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Phyl}_n." class="latex" /> This raises a number of questions:</p>
<p>• What is the mathematical nature of this operad?</p>
<p>• How is it related to &#8216;Markov processes with branching&#8217;?</p>
<p>• How is it related to known operads in topology?</p>
<p>Briefly, the answer is that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BPhyl%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Phyl}" class="latex" /> is the coproduct of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BCom%7D%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Com}," class="latex" /> the operad for commutative topological semigroups, and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5B0%2C%5Cinfty%29%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="[0,&#92;infty)," class="latex" /> the operad having only unary operations, one for each <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t+%5Cin+%5B0%2C%5Cinfty%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="t &#92;in [0,&#92;infty)." class="latex" /> The first describes branching, the second describes Markov processes. Moreover, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BPhyl%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Phyl}" class="latex" /> is closely related to the Boardmann&#8211;Vogt <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="W" class="latex" /> construction applied to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BCom%7D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Com}." class="latex" /> This is a construction that Boardmann and Vogt applied to another operad in order to obtain an operad whose algebras are loop spaces.</p>
<p>To understand all this in more detail, first recall that the <i>raison d&#8217;être</i> of operads is to have &#8216;algebras&#8217;. The most traditional sort of algebra of an operad <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O" class="latex" /> is a topological space <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> on which each operation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f+%5Cin+O_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f &#92;in O_n" class="latex" /> acts as a<br />
continuous map</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha%28f%29%5Ccolon+X%5En+%5Cto+X+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;alpha(f)&#92;colon X^n &#92;to X " class="latex" /></p>
<p>obeying some conditions: composition, the identity, and the permutation group actions are preserved, and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha%28f%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;alpha(f)" class="latex" /> depends continuously on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f." class="latex" /> The idea is that the abstract operations in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O" class="latex" /> are realized as actual operations on the space <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X." class="latex" /></p>
<p>In this paper we instead need algebras of a linear sort. Such an algebra of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O" class="latex" /> is a finite-dimensional real vector space <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="V" class="latex" /> on which each operation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f+%5Cin+O_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f &#92;in O_n" class="latex" /> acts as a multilinear map</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha%28f%29%5Ccolon+V%5En+%5Cto+X+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;alpha(f)&#92;colon V^n &#92;to X " class="latex" /></p>
<p>obeying the same list of conditions. We can also think of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha%28f%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;alpha(f)" class="latex" /> as a linear map</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha%28f%29%5Ccolon+V%5E%7B%5Cotimes+n%7D+%5Cto+V+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;alpha(f)&#92;colon V^{&#92;otimes n} &#92;to V " class="latex" /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V%5E%7B%5Cotimes+n%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="V^{&#92;otimes n}" class="latex" /> is the <i>n</i>th tensor power of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="V." class="latex" /></p>
<p>We also need &#8216;coalgebras&#8217; of operads. The point is that while ordinarily one thinks of an operation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f+%5Cin+O_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f &#92;in O_n" class="latex" /> as having <i>n</i> inputs and one output, a phylogenetic tree is better thought of as having one input and <i>n</i> outputs. A coalgebra of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O" class="latex" /> is a finite-dimensional real vector space <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="V" class="latex" /> on which operation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f+%5Cin+O_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f &#92;in O_n" class="latex" /> gives a linear map</p>

<p>The main point of this paper is that the phylogenetic operad has interesting coalgebras, which correspond to how phylogenetic trees are actually used to describe branching Markov processes in biology. But to understand this, we need to start by looking at coalgebras of two operads from which the phylogenetic operad is built.</p>
<p>By abuse of notation, we will use <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5B0%2C%5Cinfty%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="[0,&#92;infty)" class="latex" /> as the name for the operad having only unary operations, one for each <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t+%5Cin+%5B0%2C%5Cinfty%29%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="t &#92;in [0,&#92;infty)," class="latex" /> with composition of operations given by addition. A coalgebra of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5B0%2C%5Cinfty%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="[0,&#92;infty)" class="latex" /> is a finite-dimensional real vector space <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="V" class="latex" /> together with for each <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t+%5Cin+%5B0%2C%5Cinfty%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="t &#92;in [0,&#92;infty)" class="latex" /> a linear map</p>

We shall see that any Markov process on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> makes <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5EX&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}^X" class="latex" /> into a coalgebra of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5B0%2C%5Cinfty%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="[0,&#92;infty)." class="latex" /></p>
<p>This handles the Markov process aspect of DNA evolution; what about the branching? For this we use <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BCom%7D%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Com}," class="latex" /> the unique operad with one <i>n</i>-ary operation for each <i>n</i> &gt; 0. Algebras of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BCom%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Com}" class="latex" /> are not-necessarily-unital commutative algebras: there is only one way to multiply <i>n</i> elements for <i>n</i> &gt; 0.</p>
<p>For us what matters most is that coalgebras of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BCom%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Com}" class="latex" /> are finite-dimensional cocommutative coalgebras, not necessarily with counit.

<p>Next, we wish to describe how to combine the operads <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5B0%2C%5Cinfty%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="[0,&#92;infty)" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BCom%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Com}" class="latex" /> to obtain the phylogenetic operad. Any pair of operads <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%27&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O&#039;" class="latex" /> has a coproduct <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O+%2B+O%27.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O + O&#039;." class="latex" /> The definition of coproduct gives an easy way to understand the algebras of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O+%2B+O%27.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O + O&#039;." class="latex" /> Such an algebra is simply an object that is both an algebra of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O" class="latex" /> and an algebra of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%27%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O&#039;," class="latex" /> with no compatibility conditions imposed.</p>
<p>One can also give an explicit construction of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O+%2B+O%27.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O + O&#039;." class="latex" /> Briefly, the <i>n</i>-ary operations of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O+%2B+O%27&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O + O&#039;" class="latex" /> are certain equivalence classes of trees with leaves labelled <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B1%2C%5Cdots%2C+n%5C%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;{1,&#92;dots, n&#92;}" class="latex" /> and all nodes, except for leaves, labelled by operations in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O" class="latex" /> or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%27.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O&#039;." class="latex" /> While this fact is surely known to experts on operads, it seems hard to find in the literature, so we prove this in Theorem 24.</p>
<p>Given this, it should come as no surprise that the operad <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BPhyl%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Phyl}" class="latex" /> is the coproduct <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BCom%7D+%2B+%5B0%2C%5Cinfty%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Com} + [0,&#92;infty)." class="latex" /> In fact, we shall take this as a definition. Starting from this definition, we work backwards to show that the operations of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BPhyl%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Phyl}" class="latex" /> correspond to phylogenetic trees. We prove this in Theorem 28. The definition of coproduct determines a topology on the spaces <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BPhyl%7D_n%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Phyl}_n," class="latex" /> and it is a nontrivial fact that with this topology we have <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BPhyl%7D_n+%5Ccong+%5Cmathcal%7BT%7D_n+%5Ctimes+%5B0%2C%5Cinfty%29%5E%7Bn%2B1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Phyl}_n &#92;cong &#92;mathcal{T}_n &#92;times [0,&#92;infty)^{n+1}" class="latex" /> for <i>n</i> &gt; 1, where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BT%7D_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathcal{T}_n" class="latex" /> has the topology defined by Billera, Holmes and Vogtmann. We prove this in Theorem 34.</p>
<p>Using the definition of the phylogenetic operad as a coproduct, it is clear that given any Markov process on a finite set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X," class="latex" /> the vector space <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5EX&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}^X" class="latex" /> naturally becomes a coalgebra of this operad. The reason is that, as we have seen, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5EX&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}^X" class="latex" /> is automatically a coalgebra of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BCom%7D%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Com}," class="latex" /> and the Markov process makes it into a coalgebra of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5B0%2C%5Cinfty%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="[0,&#92;infty)." class="latex" /> Thus, by the universal property of a coproduct, it becomes a coalgebra of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BPhyl%7D+%5Ccong+%5Ctextrm%7BCom%7D+%2B+%5B0%2C%5Cinfty%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Phyl} &#92;cong &#92;textrm{Com} + [0,&#92;infty)." class="latex" /> We prove this in Theorem 36.</p>
<p>Since operads arose in algebraic topology, it is interesting to consider how the phylogenetic operad connects to ideas from that subject. Boardmann and Vogt defined a construction on operads, the &#8216;<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="W" class="latex" /> construction&#8217;, which when applied to the operad for spaces with an associative multiplication gives an operad for loop spaces. The operad <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BPhyl%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Phyl}" class="latex" /> has an interesting relation to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W%28%5Ctextrm%7BCom%7D%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="W(&#92;textrm{Com})." class="latex" /> To see this, define addition on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5B0%2C%5Cinfty%5D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="[0,&#92;infty]" class="latex" /> in the obvious way, where</p>

<p>Then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5B0%2C%5Cinfty%5D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="[0,&#92;infty]" class="latex" /> becomes a commutative topological monoid, so we obtain an operad with only unary operations, one for each <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t+%5Cin+%5B0%2C%5Cinfty%5D%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="t &#92;in [0,&#92;infty]," class="latex" /> where composition is addition. By abuse of notation, let us call this operad <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5B0%2C%5Cinfty%5D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="[0,&#92;infty]." class="latex" /></p>
<p>Boardmann and Vogt&#8217;s <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="W" class="latex" /> construction involves trees with edges having lengths in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5B0%2C1%5D%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="[0,1]," class="latex" /> but we can equivalently use <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5B0%2C%5Cinfty%5D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="[0,&#92;infty]." class="latex" /> <a href="http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~tl/w.pdf">Leinster</a> has observed that for any <i>nonsymmetric</i> topological operad <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O," class="latex" /> Boardmann and Vogt&#8217;s operad <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W%28O%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="W(O)" class="latex" /> is closely related to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O+%2B+%5B0%2C%5Cinfty%5D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O + [0,&#92;infty]." class="latex" /> Here we make this observation precise in the symmetric case.

<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0502155">Berger and Moerdijk</a> showed that if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S_n" class="latex" /> acts freely on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O_n" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O_1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O_1" class="latex" /> is well-pointed, then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W%28O%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="W(O)" class="latex" /> is a cofibrant replacement for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O." class="latex" /> This is true for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O+%3D+%5Ctextrm%7BAssoc%7D%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O = &#92;textrm{Assoc}," class="latex" /> the operad whose algebras are topological semigroups. This cofibrancy is why Boardmann and Vogt could use <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W%28%5Ctextrm%7BAssoc%7D%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="W(&#92;textrm{Assoc})" class="latex" /> as an operad for loop spaces. But <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S_n" class="latex" /> does not act freely on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BCom%7D_n%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Com}_n," class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W%28%5Ctextrm%7BCom%7D%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="W(&#92;textrm{Com})" class="latex" /> is not a cofibrant replacement for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BCom%7D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Com}." class="latex" /> So, it is <i>not</i> an operad for infinite loop spaces.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the larger operad <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BCom%7D+%2B+%5B0%2C%5Cinfty%5D%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Com} + [0,&#92;infty]," class="latex" /> a compactification of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BPhyl%7D+%3D+%5Ctextrm%7BCom%7D+%2B+%5B0%2C%5Cinfty%29%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;textrm{Phyl} = &#92;textrm{Com} + [0,&#92;infty)," class="latex" /> is somewhat interesting. The reason is that any Markov process</p>

					<p>The Institute for Mathematics and its Applications (or <a href="http://www.ima.umn.edu">IMA</a>, in Minneapolis, Minnesota), is teaming up with the Mathematical Biosciences Institute (or <a href="http://mbi.osu.edu/about/">MBI</a>, in Columbus, Ohio).  They&#8217;re having a big program on control theory and networks:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://mbi.osu.edu/programs/emphasis-programs/spring-2016-dynamics-biologically-inspired-networks">IMA-MBI coordinated program on network dynamics and control: Fall 2015 and Spring 2016</a>.</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://mbi.osu.edu/programs/emphasis-programs/spring-2016-dynamics-biologically-inspired-networks/">MBI emphasis semester on dynamics of biologically inspired networks: Spring 2016</a>.</p>
<h3> At the IMA </h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s happening at the Institute for Mathematics and its Applications:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Concepts and techniques from control theory are becoming increasingly interdisciplinary. At the same time, trends in modern control theory are influenced and inspired by other disciplines. As a result, the systems and control community is rapidly broadening its scope in a variety of directions. The IMA program is designed to encourage true interdisciplinary research and the cross fertilization of ideas. An important element for success is that ideas flow across disciplines in a timely manner and that the cross-fertilization takes place in unison.</p>
<p>Due to the usefulness of control, talent from control theory is drawn and often migrates to other important areas, such as biology, computer science, and biomedical research, to apply its mathematical tools and expertise. It is vital that while the links are strong, we bring together researchers who have successfully bridged into other disciplines to promote the role of control theory and to focus on the efforts of the controls community. An IMA investment in this area will be a catalyst for many advances and will provide the controls community with a cohesive research agenda.</p>
<p>In all topics of the program the need for research is pressing. For instance, viable implementations of control algorithms for smart grids are an urgent and clearly recognized need with considerable implications for the environment and quality of life. The mathematics of control will undoubtedly influence technology and vice-versa. The urgency for these new technologies suggests that the greatest impact of the program is to have it sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>First trimester (Fall 2015): Networks, whether social, biological, swarms of animals or vehicles, the Internet, etc., constitute an increasingly important subject in science and engineering. Their connectivity and feedback pathways affect robustness and functionality. Such concepts are at the core of a new and rapidly evolving frontier in the theory of dynamical systems and control. Embedded systems and networks are already pervasive in automotive, biological, aerospace, and telecommunications technologies and soon are expected to impact the power infrastructure (smart grids). In this new technological and scientific realm, the modeling and representation of systems, the role of feedback, and the value and cost of information need to be re-evaluated and understood. Traditional thinking that is relevant to a limited number of feedback loops with practically unlimited bandwidth is no longer applicable. Feedback control and stability of network dynamics is a relatively new endeavor. Analysis and control of network dynamics will occupy mostly the first trimester while applications to power networks will be a separate theme during the third trimester. The first trimester will be divided into three workshops on the topics of analysis of network dynamics and regulation, communication and cooperative control over networks, and a separate one on biological systems and networks.</p>
<p>The second trimester (Winter 2016) will have two workshops. The first will be on modeling and estimation (Workshop 4) and the second one on distributed parameter systems and partial differential equations (Workshop 5). The theme of Workshop 4 will be on structure and parsimony in models. The goal is to explore recent relevant theories and techniques that allow sparse representations, rank constrained optimization, and structural constraints in models and control designs. Our intent is to blend a group of researchers in the aforementioned topics with a select group of researchers with interests in a statistical viewpoint. Workshop 5 will focus on distributed systems and related computational issues. One of our aims is to bring control theorists with an interest in optimal control of distributed parameter systems together with mathematicians working on optimal transport theory (in essence an optimal control problem). The subject of optimal transport is rapidly developing with ramifications in probability and statistics (of essence in system modeling and hence of interest to participants in Workshop 4 as well) and in distributed control of PDE&#8217;s. Emphasis will also be placed on new tools and new mathematical developments (in PDE&#8217;s, computational methods, optimization). The workshops will be closely spaced to facilitate participation in more than one.</p>
<p>The third trimester (Spring 2016) will target applications where the mathematics of systems and control may soon prove to have a timely impact. From the invention of atomic force microscopy at the nanoscale to micro-mirror arrays for a next generation of telescopes, control has played a critical role in sensing and imaging of challenging new realms. At present, thanks to recent technological advances of AFM and optical tweezers, great strides are taking place making it possible to manipulate the biological transport of protein molecules as well as the control of individual atoms. Two intertwined subject areas, quantum and nano control and scientific instrumentation, are seen to blend together (Workshop 6) with partial focus on the role of feedback control and optimal filtering in achieving resolution and performance at such scales. A second theme (Workshop 7) will aim at control issues in distributed hybrid systems, at a macro scale, with a specific focus the “smart grid&#8221; and energy applications.

<h3> At the MBI </h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s going on at the Mathematical Biology Institute:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The MBI network program is part of a yearlong cooperative program with IMA.  </p>
<p>Networks and deterministic and stochastic dynamical systems on networks are used as models in many areas of biology. This underscores the importance of developing tools to understand the interplay between network structures and dynamical processes, as well as how network dynamics can be controlled. The dynamics associated with such models are often different from what one might traditionally expect from a large system of equations, and these differences present the opportunity to develop exciting new theories and methods that should facilitate the analysis of specific models. Moreover, a nascent area of research is the dynamics of networks in which the networks themselves change in time, which occurs, for example, in plasticity in neuroscience and in up regulation and down regulation of enzymes in biochemical systems.</p>
<p>There are many areas in biology (including neuroscience, gene networks, and epidemiology) in which network analysis is now standard. Techniques from network science have yielded many biological insights in these fields and their study has yielded many theorems. Moreover, these areas continue to be exciting areas that contain both concrete and general mathematical problems. Workshop 1 explores the mathematics behind the applications in which restrictions on general coupled systems are important. Examples of such restrictions include symmetry, Boolean dynamics, and mass-action kinetics; and each of these special properties permits the proof of theorems about dynamics on these special networks.</p>
<p>Workshop 2 focuses on the interplay between stochastic and deterministic behavior in biological networks. An important related problem is to understand how stochasticity affects parameter estimation. Analyzing the relationship between stochastic changes, network structure, and network dynamics poses mathematical questions that are new, difficult, and fascinating.</p>
<p>In recent years, an increasing number of biological systems have been modeled using networks whose structure changes in time or which use multiple kinds of couplings between the same nodes or couplings that are not just pairwise. General theories such as groupoids and hypergraphs have been developed to handle the structure in some of these more general coupled systems, and specific application models have been studied by simulation. Workshop 3 will bring together theorists, modelers, and experimentalists to address the modeling of biological systems using new network structures and the analysis of such structures.</p>
<p>Biological systems use control to achieve desired dynamics and prevent undesirable behaviors. Consequently, the study of network control is important both to reveal naturally evolved control mechanisms that underlie the functioning of biological systems and to develop human-designed control interventions to recover lost function, mitigate failures, or repurpose biological networks. Workshop 4 will address the challenging subjects of control and observability of network dynamics.</p>

<p>This summer my students <a href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/brendan.fong/">Brendan Fong</a> and <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Blake+Pollard">Blake Pollard</a> visited me at the <a href="http://www.quantumlah.org/">Centre for Quantum Technologies</a>, and we figured out how to understand <i>open</i> continuous-time Markov chains!  I think this is a nice step towards understanding the math of living systems.</p>
<p>Admittedly, it&#8217;s just a small first step.  But I&#8217;m excited by this step, since Blake and I have been trying to get this stuff to work for a couple years, and it finally fell into place.  And we think we know what to do next.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s our paper:</p>
<p>&bull; John C. Baez, Brendan Fong and Blake S. Pollard, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06448">A compositional framework for open Markov processes</a>.</p>
<p>And here&#8217;s the basic idea&#8230;</p>
<h3> Open detailed balanced Markov processes </h3>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous-time_Markov_chain">continuous-time Markov chain</a> is a way to specify the dynamics of a population which is spread across some finite set of states. Population can flow between the states. The larger the population of a state, the more rapidly population flows out of the state.  Because of this property, under certain conditions the populations of the states tend toward an equilibrium where at any state the inflow of population is balanced by its outflow.</p>
<p>In applications to statistical mechanics, we are often interested in equilibria such that for any two states connected by an edge, say <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="j," class="latex" /> the flow from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="j" class="latex" /> equals the flow from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="j" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i." class="latex" />  A continuous-time Markov chain with a chosen equilibrium having this property is called &#8216;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detailed_balance">detailed balanced</a>&#8216;.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m getting tired of saying &#8216;continuous-time Markov chain&#8217;, so from now on I&#8217;ll just say &#8216;Markov process&#8217;, just because it&#8217;s shorter.  Okay?  That will let me say the next sentence without running out of breath:</p>
<p>Our paper is about <i>open</i> detailed balanced Markov processes.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/compositional_markov/open_markov_process_1.png" /></div>
<p>The detailed balanced Markov process itself consists of a finite set of states together with a finite set of edges between them, with each state <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i" class="latex" /> labelled by an equilibrium population <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q_i+%3E0%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="q_i &gt;0," class="latex" /> and each edge <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="e" class="latex" /> labelled by a rate constant <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r_e+%3E+0.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r_e &gt; 0." class="latex" /></p>
<p>These populations and rate constants are required to obey an equation called the &#8216;detailed balance condition&#8217;.  This equation means that in equilibrium, the flow from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="j" class="latex" /> equal the flow from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="j" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i." class="latex" />  Do you see how it works in this example?</p>
<p>To get an &#8216;open&#8217; detailed balanced Markov process, some states are designated as inputs or outputs.  In general each state may be specified as both an input and an output, or as inputs and outputs multiple times.  See how that&#8217;s happening in this example?  It may seem weird, but it makes things work better.</p>
<p>People usually say Markov processes are all about how <i>probabilities</i> flow from one state to another.  But we work with un-normalized probabilities, which we call &#8216;populations&#8217;, rather than probabilities that must sum to 1.  The reason is that in an <i>open</i> Markov process, probability is not conserved: it can flow in or out at the inputs and outputs.  We allow it to flow both in and out at both the input states and the output states.</p>
<p>Our most fundamental result is that there&#8217;s a category <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BDetBalMark%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{DetBalMark}" class="latex" /> where a morphism is an open detailed balanced Markov process.  We think of it as a morphism from its inputs to its outputs.</p>
<p>We compose morphisms in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BDetBalMark%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{DetBalMark}" class="latex" /> by identifying the output states of one open detailed balanced Markov process with the input states of another. The populations of identified states must match. For example, we may compose this morphism <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="N" class="latex" />:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/compositional_markov/open_markov_process_2.png" /></div>
<p>with the previously shown morphism <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="M" class="latex" /> to get this morphism <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M+%5Ccirc+N&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="M &#92;circ N" class="latex" />:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/compositional_markov/composite_open_markov_process.png" /></div>
<p>And here&#8217;s our second most fundamental result: the category <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BDetBalMark%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{DetBalMark}" class="latex" /> is actually a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagger_compact_category">dagger compact category</a>. This lets us do other stuff with open Markov processes. An important one is &#8216;tensoring&#8217;, which lets us take two open Markov processes like <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="M" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="N" class="latex" /> above and set them side by side, giving <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M+%5Cotimes+N&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="M &#92;otimes N" class="latex" />:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/compositional_markov/tensored_open_markov_process.png" /></div>
<p>The so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_closed_category">compactness</a> is also important. This means we can take some inputs of an open Markov process and turn them into outputs, or vice versa. For example, using the compactness of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BDetBalMark%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{DetBalMark}" class="latex" /> we can get this open Markov process from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="M" class="latex" />:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/compositional_markov/dualized_open_markov_process.png" /></div>
<p>In fact all the categories in our paper are dagger compact categories, and all our functors preserve this structure.  Dagger compact categories are a well-known framework for describing systems with inputs and outputs, so this is good.</p>
<h3> The analogy to electrical circuits </h3>
<p>In a detailed balanced Markov process, population can flow along edges.  In the detailed balanced equilibrium, without any flow of population from outside, the flow along from state <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i" class="latex" /> to state <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="j" class="latex" /> will be matched by the flow back from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="j" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i." class="latex" />   The populations need to take specific values for this to occur.</p>
<p>In an electrical circuit made of linear resistors, charge can flow along wires.  In equilibrium, without any driving voltage from outside, the current along each wire will be zero.   The potentials will be equal at every node.</p>
<p>This sets up an analogy between detailed balanced continuous-time Markov chains and electrical circuits made of linear resistors!  I love analogy charts, so this makes me very happy:</p>

<p>This analogy is already well known.  Schnakenberg used it in his book <i>Thermodynamic Network Analysis of Biological Systems</i>.   So, our main goal is to formalize and exploit it.  This analogy extends from systems in equilibrium to the more interesting case of nonequilibrium steady states, which are the main topic of our paper.</p>
<p><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/04/28/a-compositional-framework-for-passive-linear-networks/">Earlier</a>, Brendan and I introduced a way to &#8216;black box&#8217; a circuit and define the relation it determines between potential-current pairs at the input and output terminals.  This relation describes the circuit&#8217;s external behavior as seen by an observer who can only perform measurements at the terminals.</p>
<p>An important fact is that black boxing is &#8216;compositional&#8217;: if one builds a circuit from smaller pieces, the external behavior of the whole circuit can be determined from the external behaviors of the pieces.  For category theorists, this means that black boxing is a functor!</p>
<p>Our new paper with Blake develops a similar &#8216;black box functor&#8217; for detailed balanced Markov processes, and relates it to the earlier one for circuits.</p>
<p>When you black box a detailed balanced Markov process, you get the relation between population&#8211;flow pairs at the terminals.  (By the &#8216;flow at a terminal&#8217;, we more precisely mean the net population outflow.)  This relation holds not only in equilibrium, but also in any nonequilibrium steady state.  Thus, <i>black boxing an open detailed balanced Markov process gives its steady state dynamics as seen by an observer who can only measure populations and flows at the terminals</i>.</p>
<h3> The principle of minimum dissipation </h3>
<p>At least since the work of Prigogine, it&#8217;s been widely accepted that a large class of systems minimize entropy production in a nonequilibrium steady state.  But people still fight about the the precise boundary of this class of systems, and even the meaning of this &#8216;principle of minimum entropy production&#8217;.</p>
<p>For detailed balanced open Markov processes, we show that a quantity we call the &#8216;dissipation&#8217; is minimized in any steady state.  This is a quadratic function of the populations and flows, analogous to the power dissipation of a circuit made of resistors.  We make no claim that this quadratic function actually deserves to be called &#8216;entropy production&#8217;.  Indeed, <a href="http://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.48.571">Schnakenberg</a> has convincingly argued that they are only approximately equal.</p>
<p>But still, the &#8216;dissipation&#8217; function is very natural and useful&mdash;and Prigogine&#8217;s so-called &#8216;entropy production&#8217; is also a quadratic function.</p>
<h3> Black boxing </h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve already mentioned the category <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BDetBalMark%7D%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{DetBalMark}," class="latex" /> where a morphism is an open detailed balanced Markov process.  But our paper needs two more categories to tell its story!  There&#8217;s the category of circuits, and the category of linear relations.</p>
<p>A morphism in the category <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BCirc%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{Circ}" class="latex" /> is an open electrical circuit made of resistors: that is, a graph with each edge labelled by a &#8216;conductance&#8217; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_e+%3E+0%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c_e &gt; 0," class="latex" /> together with specified input and output nodes:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/compositional_markov/open_circuit.png" /></div>
<p>A morphism in the category <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BLinRel%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{LinRel}" class="latex" /> is a linear relation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L+%3A+U+%5Cleadsto+V&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="L : U &#92;leadsto V" class="latex" /> between finite-dimensional real vector spaces <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=U&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="U" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="V." class="latex" />   This is nothing but a linear subspace <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L+%5Csubseteq+U+%5Coplus+V.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="L &#92;subseteq U &#92;oplus V." class="latex" />  Just as relations generalize functions, linear relations generalize linear functions!</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/04/28/a-compositional-framework-for-passive-linear-networks/">previous paper</a>, Brendan and I introduced these two categories and a functor between them, the &#8216;black box functor&#8217;:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cblacksquare+%3A+%5Cmathrm%7BCirc%7D+%5Cto+%5Cmathrm%7BLinRel%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;blacksquare : &#92;mathrm{Circ} &#92;to &#92;mathrm{LinRel} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>The idea is that any circuit determines a linear relation between the potentials and net current flows at the inputs and outputs.   This relation describes the behavior of a circuit of resistors as seen from outside.</p>
<p>Our new paper introduces a black box functor for detailed balanced Markov processes:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csquare+%3A+%5Cmathrm%7BDetBalMark%7D+%5Cto+%5Cmathrm%7BLinRel%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;square : &#92;mathrm{DetBalMark} &#92;to &#92;mathrm{LinRel} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>We draw this functor as a white box merely to distinguish it from the other black box functor.  The functor <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csquare&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;square" class="latex" /> maps any detailed balanced Markov process to the linear relation obeyed by populations and flows at the inputs and outputs in a steady state.  In short, it describes the steady state behavior of the Markov process &#8216;as seen from outside&#8217;.</p>
<p>How do we manage to black box detailed balanced Markov processes?  We do it using the analogy with circuits!</p>
<h3> The analogy becomes a functor </h3>
<p>Every analogy wants to be a functor.  So, we make the analogy between detailed balanced Markov processes and circuits precise by turning it into a functor:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K+%3A+%5Cmathrm%7BDetBalMark%7D+%5Cto+%5Cmathrm%7BCirc%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="K : &#92;mathrm{DetBalMark} &#92;to &#92;mathrm{Circ}" class="latex" /></p>
<p>This functor converts any open detailed balanced Markov process into an open electrical circuit made of resistors.  This circuit is carefully chosen to reflect the steady-state behavior of the Markov process.   Its underlying graph is the same as that of the Markov process.  So, the &#8216;states&#8217; of the Markov process are the same as the &#8216;nodes&#8217; of the circuit.</p>
<p>Both the equilibrium populations at states of the Markov process and the rate constants labelling edges of the Markov process are used to compute the conductances of edges of this circuit.  In the simple case where the Markov process has exactly one edge from any state <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i" class="latex" /> to any state <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="j," class="latex" /> the rule is this:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_%7Bi+j%7D+%3D+H_%7Bi+j%7D+q_j+++&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C_{i j} = H_{i j} q_j   " class="latex" /></p>

This is just right for an electrical circuit made of resistors, since it means that the resistance of the wire from node <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i" class="latex" /> to node <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="j" class="latex" /> equals the resistance of the same wire in the reverse direction, from node <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="j" class="latex" /> to node <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i." class="latex" /></p>
<h3> A triangle of functors </h3>
<p>If you paid careful attention, you&#8217;ll have noticed that I&#8217;ve described a triangle of functors:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="350" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/compositional_markov/triangle_of_functors.png" /></div>
<p>And if you know anything about how category theorists think, you&#8217;ll be wondering if this diagram commutes.</p>
<p>In fact, this triangle of functors does not commute!   However, a general lesson of category theory is that we should only expect diagrams of functors to commute <i>up to natural isomorphism</i>, and this is what happens here:</p>
<div align="center">

<p>The natural transformation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;alpha" class="latex" /> &#8216;corrects&#8217; the black box functor for resistors to give the one for detailed balanced Markov processes.</p>
<p>The functors <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csquare&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;square" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cblacksquare+%5Ccirc+K&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;blacksquare &#92;circ K" class="latex" /> are actually equal on objects.  An object in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BDetBalMark%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{DetBalMark}" class="latex" /> is a finite set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> with each element <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i+%5Cin+X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i &#92;in X" class="latex" /> labelled a positive populations <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q_i.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="q_i." class="latex" /> Both functors map this object to the vector space <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5EX+%5Coplus+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5EX.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}^X &#92;oplus &#92;mathbb{R}^X." class="latex" />    For the functor <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csquare%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;square," class="latex" /> we think of this as a space of population-flow pairs.  For the functor <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cblacksquare+%5Ccirc+K%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;blacksquare &#92;circ K," class="latex" /> we think of it as a space of potential-current pairs.  The natural transformation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;alpha" class="latex" /> then gives a linear relation</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha_%7BX%2Cq%7D+%3A+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5EX+%5Coplus+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5EX+%5Cleadsto+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5EX+%5Coplus+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5EX&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;alpha_{X,q} : &#92;mathbb{R}^X &#92;oplus &#92;mathbb{R}^X &#92;leadsto &#92;mathbb{R}^X &#92;oplus &#92;mathbb{R}^X" class="latex" /></p>
<p>in fact an isomorphism of vector spaces, which converts potential-current pairs into population-flow pairs in a manner that depends on the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q_i.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="q_i." class="latex" />  I&#8217;ll skip the formula; it&#8217;s in the paper.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s the key point.  The naturality of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;alpha" class="latex" /> actually allows us to reduce the problem of computing the functor <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csquare&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;square" class="latex" /> to the problem of computing <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cblacksquare.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;blacksquare." class="latex" />   Suppose</p>

<p>is any morphism in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BDetBalMark%7D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{DetBalMark}." class="latex" />  The object <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28X%2Cq%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(X,q)" class="latex" /> is some finite set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> labelled by populations <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="q," class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28Y%2Cr%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(Y,r)" class="latex" /> is some finite set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Y" class="latex" /> labelled by populations <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r." class="latex" />  Then the naturality of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;alpha" class="latex" /> means that this square commutes:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="300" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/compositional_markov/naturality_square.png" /></div>
<p>Since <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha_%7BX%2Cq%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;alpha_{X,q}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha_%7BY%2Cr%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;alpha_{Y,r}" class="latex" /> are isomorphisms, we can solve for the functor <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csquare&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;square" class="latex" /> as follows:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csquare%28M%29+%3D+%5Calpha_Y+%5Ccirc+%5Cblacksquare+K%28M%29+%5Ccirc+%5Calpha_X%5E%7B-1%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;square(M) = &#92;alpha_Y &#92;circ &#92;blacksquare K(M) &#92;circ &#92;alpha_X^{-1} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>This equation has a clear intuitive meaning!   It says that to compute the behavior of a detailed balanced Markov process, namely <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csquare%28f%29%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;square(f)," class="latex" /> we convert it into a circuit made of resistors and compute the behavior of that, namely <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cblacksquare+K%28f%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;blacksquare K(f)." class="latex" />  This is not <i>equal</i> to the behavior of the Markov process, but we can compute that behavior by converting the input populations and flows into potentials and currents, feeding them into our circuit, and then converting the outputs back into populations and flows.</p>
<h3> What we really do </h3>
<p>So that&#8217;s a sketch of what we do, and I hope you ask questions if it&#8217;s not clear.  But I also hope you read our paper!  Here&#8217;s what we actually do in there.  After an introduction and summary of results:</p>
<p>&bull; Section 3 defines open Markov processes and the open master equation.</p>
<p>&bull; Section 4 introduces detailed balance for open Markov<br />
processes.</p>
<p>&bull; Section 5 recalls the principle of minimum power<br />
for open circuits made of linear resistors, and explains how to black box them.</p>
<p>&bull; Section 6 introduces the principle of minimum dissipation for open detailed balanced Markov processes, and describes how to black box these.</p>
<p>&bull; Section 7 states the analogy between circuits and detailed balanced Markov processes in a formal way.</p>
<p>&bull; Section 8 describes how to compose open Markov processes, making them into the morphisms of a category.</p>
<p>&bull; Section 9 does the same for detailed balanced Markov processes.</p>
<p>&bull; Section 10 describes the &#8216;black box functor&#8217; that sends any open detailed balanced Markov process to the linear relation describing its external behavior, and recalls the similar functor for circuits.</p>
<p>&bull; Section 11 makes the analogy between between open detailed balanced Markov processes and open circuits even more formal, by making it into a functor.  We prove that together with the two black box functors, this forms a triangle that commutes up to natural isomorphism.</p>
<p>&bull; Section 12 is about geometric aspects of this theory.  We show that the linear relations in the image of these black box functors are Lagrangian relations between symplectic vector spaces.  We also show that the master equation can be seen as a gradient flow equation.</p>
<p>&bull; Section 13 is a summary of what we have learned.</p>
<p>Finally, Appendix A is a quick tutorial on decorated cospans.  This is a key mathematical tool in our work, developed by Brendan in <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.00872">an earlier paper</a>.</p>

<p>Here you see three planets.  The blue planet is orbiting the Sun in a realistic way: it&#8217;s going around an ellipse.</p>
<p>The other two are moving <i>in and out</i> just like the blue planet, so they all stay on the same circle.  But they&#8217;re moving around this circle at different rates!  The green planet is moving faster than the blue one: it completes 3 orbits each time the blue planet goes around once.  The red planet isn&#8217;t going around at all: it only moves in and out.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s going on here?</p>
<p>In 1687, Isaac Newton published his <i>Principia Mathematica</i>.  This book is famous, but in Propositions 43–45 of Book I he did something that people didn&#8217;t talk about much&mdash;until recently.  He figured out what extra force, besides gravity, would make a planet move like one of these weird other planets.   It turns out an extra force obeying an inverse cube law will do the job!</p>
<p>Let me make this more precise.  We&#8217;re only interested in &#8216;central forces&#8217; here.  A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_force"><b>central force</b></a> is one that only pushes a particle towards or away from some chosen point, and only depends on the particle&#8217;s distance from that point.  In Newton&#8217;s theory, gravity is a central force obeying an inverse square law:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%28r%29+%3D+-+%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7Ba%7D%7Br%5E2%7D+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F(r) = - &#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{a}{r^2} } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>for some constant <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a." class="latex" />  But he considered adding an extra central force obeying an <i>inverse cube</i> law:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%28r%29+%3D+-+%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7Ba%7D%7Br%5E2%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7Bb%7D%7Br%5E3%7D+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F(r) = - &#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{a}{r^2} + &#92;frac{b}{r^3} } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>He showed that if you do this, for any motion of a particle in the force of gravity you can find a motion of a particle in gravity plus this extra force, where the distance <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%28t%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r(t)" class="latex" /> is the same, but the angle <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta%28t%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;theta(t)" class="latex" /> is not.</p>
<p>In fact Newton did more.  He showed that if we start with <i>any</i> central force, adding an inverse cube force has this effect.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a very long page about this on Wikipedia:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_theorem_of_revolving_orbits">Newton&#8217;s theorem of revolving orbits</a>, Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t fully understood all of this, but it instantly makes me think of three other things I know about the inverse cube force law, which are probably related.  So maybe you can help me figure out the relationship.</p>
<p>The first, and simplest, is this.  Suppose we have a particle in a central force.  It will move in a plane, so we can use polar coordinates <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%2C+%5Ctheta&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r, &#92;theta" class="latex" /> to describe its position.  We can describe the force away from the origin as a function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%28r%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F(r)." class="latex" />   Then the radial part of the particle&#8217;s motion obeys this equation:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+m+%5Cddot+r+%3D+F%28r%29+%2B+%5Cfrac%7BL%5E2%7D%7Bmr%5E3%7D+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ m &#92;ddot r = F(r) + &#92;frac{L^2}{mr^3} } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="L" class="latex" /> is the magnitude of particle&#8217;s angular momentum.</p>
<p>So, angular momentum acts to provide a &#8216;fictitious force&#8217; pushing the particle out, which one might call the centrifugal force.  And this force obeys an inverse cube force law!</p>
<p>Furthermore, thanks to the formula above, it&#8217;s pretty obvious that if you change <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="L" class="latex" /> but also add a precisely compensating inverse cube force, the value of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cddot+r&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;ddot r" class="latex" /> will be unchanged!  So, we can set things up so that the particle&#8217;s radial motion will be unchanged.  But its angular motion will be different, since it has a different angular momentum.  This explains Newton&#8217;s observation.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s often handy to write a central force in terms of a potential:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%28r%29+%3D+-V%27%28r%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F(r) = -V&#039;(r)" class="latex" /></p>
<p>Then we can make up an extra potential responsible for the centrifugal force, and combine it with the actual potential <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="V" class="latex" /> into a so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_potential"><b>effective potential</b></a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+U%28r%29+%3D+V%28r%29+%2B+%5Cfrac%7BL%5E2%7D%7B2mr%5E2%7D+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ U(r) = V(r) + &#92;frac{L^2}{2mr^2} } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>The particle&#8217;s radial motion then obeys a simple equation:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cddot%7Br%7D+%3D+-+U%27%28r%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;ddot{r} = - U&#039;(r) " class="latex" /></p>
<p>For a particle in gravity, where the force obeys an inverse square law and  <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="V" class="latex" /> is proportional to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=-1%2Fr%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="-1/r," class="latex" /> the effective potential might look like this:</p>
<div align="center"><img border="2" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physical/effective_potential.jpg" /></div>
<p>This is the graph of</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+U%28r%29+%3D+-%5Cfrac%7B4%7D%7Br%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Br%5E2%7D+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ U(r) = -&#92;frac{4}{r} + &#92;frac{1}{r^2} } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re used to particles rolling around in potentials, you can easily see that a particle with not too much energy will move back and forth, never making it to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r+%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r = 0" class="latex" /> or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r+%3D+%5Cinfty.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r = &#92;infty." class="latex" />   This corresponds to an elliptical orbit.  Give it more energy and the particle can escape to infinity, but it will never hit the origin.  The repulsive &#8216;centrifugal force&#8217; always overwhelms the attraction of gravity near the origin, at least if the angular momentum is nonzero.</p>
<p>On the other hand, suppose we have a particle moving in an attractive inverse cube force!  Then the potential is proportional to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2Fr%5E2%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="1/r^2," class="latex" /> so the effective potential is</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+U%28r%29+%3D+%5Cfrac%7Bc%7D%7Br%5E2%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7BL%5E2%7D%7Bmr%5E2%7D+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ U(r) = &#92;frac{c}{r^2} + &#92;frac{L^2}{mr^2} } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c" class="latex" /> is negative for an attractive force.  If this attractive force is big enough, namely</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+c+%3C+-%5Cfrac%7BL%5E2%7D%7Bm%7D+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ c &lt; -&#92;frac{L^2}{m} } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>then this force can exceed the centrifugal force, and the particle can fall in to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r+%3D+0.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r = 0." class="latex" /></p>
<p>If we keep track of the angular coordinate <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;theta," class="latex" /> we can see what&#8217;s really going on.  The particle is <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotes's_spiral">spiraling in to its doom</a></i>, hitting the origin in a finite amount of time!</p>
<div align="center"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotes's_spiral"><br />
<img width="300" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/hyperbolic_spiral.png" /></a></div>
<p>This should remind you of a black hole, and indeed something similar happens there, but even more drastic:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_geodesics#Effective_radial_potential_energy">Schwarzschild geodesics: effective radial potential energy</a>, Wikipedia.</p>
<p>For a nonrotating uncharged black hole, the effective potential has three terms.   Like Newtonian gravity it has an attractive <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=-1%2Fr&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="-1/r" class="latex" /> term and a repulsive <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2Fr%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="1/r^2" class="latex" /> term.  But it also has an attractive term <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=-1%2Fr%5E3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="-1/r^3" class="latex" /> term!  In other words, it&#8217;s as if on top of Newtonian gravity, we had another attractive force obeying an inverse <i>fourth power</i> law!  This overwhelms the others at short distances, so if you get too close to a black hole, you spiral in to your doom.</p>
<p>For example, a black hole can have an effective potential like this:</p>
<div align="center"><img border="2" width="380" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physical/effective_potential_schwarzschild.jpg" /></div>
<p>But back to inverse cube force laws!  I know two more things about them.  A while back I discussed how a particle in an inverse square force can be reinterpreted as a harmonic oscillator:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/03/17/planets_in_the_4th_dimension/">Planets in the fourth dimension</a>, <i>Azimuth</i>.</p>
<p>There are many ways to think about this, and apparently the idea in some form goes all the way back to Newton!  It involves a sneaky way to take a particle in a potential</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+V%28r%29+%5Cpropto+r%5E%7B-1%7D+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ V(r) &#92;propto r^{-1} }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>and think of it as moving around in the complex plane.  Then if you <i>square</i> its position&mdash;thought of as a complex number&mdash;and cleverly <i>reparametrize time</i>, you get a particle moving in a potential</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+V%28r%29+%5Cpropto+r%5E2+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ V(r) &#92;propto r^2 } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>This amazing trick can be generalized!  A particle in a potential</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+V%28r%29+%5Cpropto+r%5Ep+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ V(r) &#92;propto r^p }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>can transformed to a particle in a potential</p>

<p>A good description is here:</p>

<p>This trick transforms particles in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%5Ep&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r^p" class="latex" /> potentials with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p" class="latex" /> ranging between <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=-2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="-2" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%2B%5Cinfty&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="+&#92;infty" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%5Eq&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r^q" class="latex" /> potentials with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="q" class="latex" /> ranging between <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%2B%5Cinfty&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="+&#92;infty" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=-2.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="-2." class="latex" />  It&#8217;s like a see-saw: when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p" class="latex" /> is small, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="q" class="latex" /> is big, and vice versa.</p>
<p>But you&#8217;ll notice this trick doesn&#8217;t actually work <i>at</i> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p+%3D+-2%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p = -2," class="latex" /> the case that corresponds to the inverse cube force law.  The problem is that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p+%2B+2+%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p + 2 = 0" class="latex" /> in this case, so we can&#8217;t find <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="q" class="latex" /> with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28p%2B2%29%28q%2B2%29+%3D+4.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(p+2)(q+2) = 4." class="latex" /></p>
<p>So, the inverse cube force is special in three ways: it&#8217;s the one that you can add on to any force to get solutions with the same radial motion but different angular motion, it&#8217;s the one that naturally describes the &#8216;centrifugal force&#8217;, and it&#8217;s the one that doesn&#8217;t have a partner!  We&#8217;ve seen how the first two ways are secretly the same.  I don&#8217;t know about the third, but I&#8217;m hopeful.</p>
<h3> Quantum aspects </h3>
<p>Finally, here&#8217;s a fourth way in which the inverse cube law is special.  This shows up most visibly in quantum mechanics&#8230; and this is what got me interested in this business in the first place.</p>
<p>You see, I&#8217;m writing a paper called &#8216;Struggles with the continuum&#8217;, which discusses problems in analysis that arise when you try to make some of our favorite theories of physics make sense.  The inverse square force law poses interesting problems of this sort, which I plan to discuss.  But I started wanting to compare the inverse cube force law, just so people can see things that go wrong in this case, and not take our successes with the inverse square law for granted.</p>
<p>Unfortunately a huge digression on the inverse cube force law would be out of place in that paper.  So, I&#8217;m offloading some of that material to here.</p>
<p>In quantum mechanics, a particle moving in an inverse cube force law has a Hamiltonian like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H+%3D+-%5Cnabla%5E2+%2B+c+r%5E%7B-2%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="H = -&#92;nabla^2 + c r^{-2}" class="latex" /></p>
<p>The first term describes the kinetic energy, while the second describes the potential energy.   I&#8217;m setting <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chbar+%3D+1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;hbar = 1" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2m+%3D+1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="2m = 1" class="latex" /> to remove some clutter that doesn&#8217;t really affect the key issues.</p>
<p>To see how strange this Hamiltonian is, let me compare an easier case.  If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p+%3C+2%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p &lt; 2," class="latex" /> the Hamiltonian</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H+%3D+-%5Cnabla%5E2+%2B+c+r%5E%7B-p%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="H = -&#92;nabla^2 + c r^{-p}" class="latex" /></p>
<p>is essentially self-adjoint on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_0%5E%5Cinfty%28%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E3+-+%5C%7B0%5C%7D%29%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C_0^&#92;infty(&#92;mathbb{R}^3 - &#92;{0&#92;})," class="latex" /> which is the space of compactly supported smooth functions on 3d Euclidean space minus the origin.  What this means is that first of all, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="H" class="latex" /> is defined on this domain: it maps functions in this domain to functions in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5E2%28%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E3%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="L^2(&#92;mathbb{R}^3)" class="latex" />.  But more importantly, it means we can uniquely extend <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="H" class="latex" /> from this domain to a self-adjoint operator on some larger domain.  In quantum physics, we want our Hamiltonians to be self-adjoint.  So, this fact is good.</p>
<p>Proving this fact is fairly hard!  It uses something called the Kato&ndash;Lax&ndash;Milgram&ndash;Nelson theorem together with this beautiful inequality:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cint_%7B%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E3%7D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B4r%5E2%7D+%7C%5Cpsi%28x%29%7C%5E2+%5C%2Cd%5E3+x+%5Cle+%5Cint_%7B%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E3%7D+%7C%5Cnabla+%5Cpsi%28x%29%7C%5E2+%5C%2Cd%5E3+x+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;int_{&#92;mathbb{R}^3} &#92;frac{1}{4r^2} |&#92;psi(x)|^2 &#92;,d^3 x &#92;le &#92;int_{&#92;mathbb{R}^3} |&#92;nabla &#92;psi(x)|^2 &#92;,d^3 x } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>for any <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpsi%5Cin+C_0%5E%5Cinfty%28%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E3%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;psi&#92;in C_0^&#92;infty(&#92;mathbb{R}^3)." class="latex" /></p>
<p>If you think hard, you can see this inequality is actually a fact about the quantum mechanics of the inverse cube law!  It says that if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+%5Cge+-1%2F4%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c &#92;ge -1/4," class="latex" /> the energy of a quantum particle in the potential <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+r%5E%7B-2%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c r^{-2}" class="latex" /> is bounded below.  And in a sense, this inequality is optimal: if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+%3C+-1%2F4&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c &lt; -1/4" class="latex" />, the energy is <i>not</i> bounded below.  This is the quantum version of how a classical particle can spiral in to its doom in an attractive inverse cube law, if it doesn&#8217;t have enough angular momentum.  But it&#8217;s subtly and mysteriously different.</p>
<p>You may wonder how this inequality is used to prove good things about potentials that are &#8216;less singular&#8217; than the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+r%5E%7B-2%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c r^{-2}" class="latex" /> potential: that is, potentials <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+r%5E%7B-p%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c r^{-p}" class="latex" /> with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p+%3C+2.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p &lt; 2." class="latex" />  For that, you have to use some tricks that I don&#8217;t want to explain here.  I also don&#8217;t want to prove this inequality, or explain why its optimal!  You can find most of this in some old course notes of mine:</p>

<p>See especially section 15.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s pretty easy to see how this inequality implies things about the expected energy of a quantum particle in the potential <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+r%5E%7B-2%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c r^{-2}" class="latex" />.  So let&#8217;s do that.</p>
<p>In this potential, the expected energy of a state <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpsi&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;psi" class="latex" /> is:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B++%5Clangle+%5Cpsi%2C+H+%5Cpsi+%5Crangle+%3D+++%5Cint_%7B%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E3%7D+%5Coverline%5Cpsi%28x%29%5C%2C+%28-%5Cnabla%5E2+%2B+c+r%5E%7B-2%7D%29%5Cpsi%28x%29+%5C%2C+d%5E3+x+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{  &#92;langle &#92;psi, H &#92;psi &#92;rangle =   &#92;int_{&#92;mathbb{R}^3} &#92;overline&#92;psi(x)&#92;, (-&#92;nabla^2 + c r^{-2})&#92;psi(x) &#92;, d^3 x }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>Doing an integration by parts, this gives:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B++%5Clangle+%5Cpsi%2C+H+%5Cpsi+%5Crangle+%3D+%5Cint_%7B%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E3%7D+%7C%5Cnabla+%5Cpsi%28x%29%7C%5E2+%2B+cr%5E%7B-2%7D+%7C%5Cpsi%28x%29%7C%5E2+%5C%2Cd%5E3+x+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{  &#92;langle &#92;psi, H &#92;psi &#92;rangle = &#92;int_{&#92;mathbb{R}^3} |&#92;nabla &#92;psi(x)|^2 + cr^{-2} |&#92;psi(x)|^2 &#92;,d^3 x } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>The inequality I showed you says precisely that when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+%3D+-1%2F4%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c = -1/4," class="latex" /> this is greater than or equal to zero.  So, the expected energy is actually <i>nonnegative</i> in this case!  And making <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c" class="latex" /> greater than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=-1%2F4&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="-1/4" class="latex" /> only makes the expected energy bigger.</p>
<p>Note that in classical mechanics, the energy of a particle in this potential ceases to be bounded below as soon as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+%3C+0.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c &lt; 0." class="latex" />  Quantum mechanics is different because of the uncertainty principle!  To get a lot of negative potential energy, the particle&#8217;s wavefunction must be squished near the origin, but that gives it kinetic energy.</p>
<p>It turns out that the Hamiltonian for a quantum particle in an inverse cube force law has exquisitely subtle and tricky behavior.  Many people have written about it, running into &#8216;paradoxes&#8217; when they weren&#8217;t careful enough.  Only rather recently have things been straightened out.</p>
<p>For starters, the Hamiltonian for this kind of particle</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H+%3D+-%5Cnabla%5E2+%2B+c+r%5E%7B-2%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="H = -&#92;nabla^2 + c r^{-2}" class="latex" /></p>
<p>has different behaviors depending on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c." class="latex" />  Obviously the force is attractive when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+%3E+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c &gt; 0" class="latex" /> and repulsive when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+%3C+0%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c &lt; 0," class="latex" /> but that&#8217;s not the only thing that matters!  Here&#8217;s a summary:</p>
<p>&bull; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+%5Cge+3%2F4.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c &#92;ge 3/4." class="latex" />  In this case <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="H" class="latex" /> is essentially self-adjoint on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_0%5E%5Cinfty%28%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E3+-+%5C%7B0%5C%7D%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C_0^&#92;infty(&#92;mathbb{R}^3 - &#92;{0&#92;})." class="latex" />  So, it admits a unique self-adjoint extension and there&#8217;s no ambiguity about this case.</p>
<p>&bull; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+%3C+3%2F4.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c &lt; 3/4." class="latex" />  In this case <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="H" class="latex" /> is <i>not</i> essentially self-adjoint on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_0%5E%5Cinfty%28%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E3+-+%5C%7B0%5C%7D%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C_0^&#92;infty(&#92;mathbb{R}^3 - &#92;{0&#92;})." class="latex" />  In fact, it admits more than one self-adjoint extension!  This means that we need <i>extra input from physics</i> to choose the Hamiltonian in this case.  It turns out that we need to say what happens when the particle hits the singularity at <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r+%3D+0.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r = 0." class="latex" />  This is a long and fascinating story that I just learned yesterday.</p>
<p>&bull; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+%5Cge+-1%2F4.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c &#92;ge -1/4." class="latex" />  In this case the expected energy <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5Cpsi%2C+H+%5Cpsi+%5Crangle+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;langle &#92;psi, H &#92;psi &#92;rangle " class="latex" /> is bounded below for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpsi+%5Cin+C_0%5E%5Cinfty%28%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E3+-+%5C%7B0%5C%7D%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;psi &#92;in C_0^&#92;infty(&#92;mathbb{R}^3 - &#92;{0&#92;})." class="latex" />   It turns out that whenever we have a Hamiltonian that is bounded below, even if there is not a <i>unique</i> self-adjoint extension, there exists a canonical &#8216;best choice&#8217; of self-adjoint extension, called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrichs_extension">Friedrichs extension</a>.  I explain this in my course notes.</p>
<p>&bull; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+%3C+-1%2F4.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c &lt; -1/4." class="latex" />  In this case the expected energy is not bounded below, so we don&#8217;t have the Friedrichs extension to help us choose which self-adjoint extension is &#8216;best&#8217;.</p>
<p>To go all the way down this rabbit hole, I recommend these two papers:</p>
<p>&bull; Sarang Gopalakrishnan, <i><a href="https://www.amherst.edu/media/view/10264/original/gopalakrishnan06.pdf">Self-Adjointness and the Renormalization of Singular Potentials</a></i>, B.A. Thesis, Amherst College.</p>
<p>&bull; D. M. Gitman, I. V. Tyutin and B. L. Voronov, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.5277">Self-adjoint extensions and spectral analysis in the Calogero problem</a>,  <i>Jour. Phys. A</i> <b>43</b> (2010), 145205.</p>
<p>The first is good for a broad overview of problems associated to singular potentials such as the inverse cube force law; there is attention to mathematical rigor the focus is on physical insight.  The second is good if you want&mdash;as I wanted&mdash;to really get to the bottom of the inverse cube force law in quantum mechanics.  Both have lots of references.</p>
<p>Also, both point out a crucial fact I haven&#8217;t mentioned yet: in quantum mechanics the inverse cube force law is special because, <i>naively, at least</i> it has a kind of symmetry under rescaling!  You can see this from the formula</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H+%3D+-%5Cnabla%5E2+%2B+cr%5E%7B-2%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="H = -&#92;nabla^2 + cr^{-2} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>by noting that both the Laplacian and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%5E%7B-2%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r^{-2}" class="latex" /> have units of length<sup>-2</sup>.  So, they both transform in the same way under rescaling: if you take any smooth function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpsi&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;psi" class="latex" />, apply <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="H" class="latex" /> and then expand the result by a factor of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k," class="latex" /> you get <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k^2" class="latex" /> times what you get if you do those operations in the other order.</p>
<p>In particular, this means that if you have a smooth eigenfunction of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="H" class="latex" /> with eigenvalue <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;lambda," class="latex" /> you will also have one with eigenfunction <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%5E2+%5Clambda&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k^2 &#92;lambda" class="latex" /> for any <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k+%3E+0.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k &gt; 0." class="latex" />  And if your original eigenfunction was normalizable, so will be the new one!</p>
<p>With some calculation you can show that when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+%5Cle+-1%2F4%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c &#92;le -1/4," class="latex" /> the Hamiltonian <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="H" class="latex" /> has a smooth normalizable eigenfunction with a negative eigenvalue.  In fact it&#8217;s spherically symmetric, so finding it is not so terribly hard.  But this instantly implies that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="H" class="latex" /> has smooth normalizable eigenfunctions with <i>any</i> negative eigenvalue.</p>
<p>This implies various things, some terrifying.  First of all, it means that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="H" class="latex" /> is not bounded below, at least not on the space of smooth normalizable functions.  A similar but more delicate scaling argument shows that it&#8217;s also not bounded below on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_0%5E%5Cinfty%28%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E3+-+%5C%7B0%5C%7D%29%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C_0^&#92;infty(&#92;mathbb{R}^3 - &#92;{0&#92;})," class="latex" /> as I claimed earlier.</p>
<p>This is scary but not terrifying: it simply means that when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+%5Cle+-1%2F4%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c &#92;le -1/4," class="latex" /> the potential is too strongly negative for the Hamiltonian to be bounded below.</p>
<p>The terrifying part is this: we&#8217;re getting uncountably many normalizable eigenfunctions, all with different eigenvalues, one for each choice of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k." class="latex" />  A self-adjoint operator on a countable-dimensional Hilbert space like <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5E2%28%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E3%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="L^2(&#92;mathbb{R}^3)" class="latex" /> can&#8217;t have uncountably many normalizable eigenvectors with different eigenvalues, since then they&#8217;d all be orthogonal to each other, and that&#8217;s too many orthogonal vectors to fit in a Hilbert space of countable dimension!</p>
<p>This sounds like a paradox, but it&#8217;s not.  These functions are not all orthogonal, and they&#8217;re not all eigenfunctions of a self-adjoint operator.  You see, the operator <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="H" class="latex" /> is not self-adjoint on the domain we&#8217;ve chosen, the space of all smooth functions in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5E2%28%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E3%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="L^2(&#92;mathbb{R}^3)." class="latex" />  We can carefully choose a domain to get a self-adjoint operator&#8230; but it turns out there are many ways to do it.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, in most cases this choice breaks the naive dilation symmetry.  So, we&#8217;re getting what physicists call an &#8216;anomaly&#8217;: a symmetry of a classical system that fails to give a symmetry of the corresponding quantum system.</p>
<p>Of course, if you&#8217;ve made it this far, you probably want to understand what the different choices of Hamiltonian for a particle in an inverse cube force law <i>actually mean, physically.</i>  The idea seems to be that they say how the particle changes phase when it hits the singularity at <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r+%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r = 0" class="latex" /> and bounces back out.</p>
<p>(Why does it bounce back out?  Well, if it didn&#8217;t, time evolution would not be unitary, so it would not be described by a self-adjoint Hamiltonian!  We could try to describe the physics of a quantum particle that <i>does not</i> come back out when it hits the singularity, and I believe people have tried, but this requires a different set of mathematical tools.)</p>
<p>For a detailed analysis of this, it seems one should take Schr&ouml;dinger&#8217;s equation and do a separation of variables into the angular part and the radial part:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpsi%28r%2C%5Ctheta%2C%5Cphi%29+%3D+%5CPsi%28r%29+%5CPhi%28%5Ctheta%2C%5Cphi%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;psi(r,&#92;theta,&#92;phi) = &#92;Psi(r) &#92;Phi(&#92;theta,&#92;phi) " class="latex" /></p>
<p>For each choice of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cell+%3D+0%2C1%2C2%2C%5Cdots&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;ell = 0,1,2,&#92;dots" class="latex" /> one gets a space of spherical harmonics that one can use for the angular part <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CPhi.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;Phi." class="latex" />  The interesting part is the radial part, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CPsi.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;Psi." class="latex" />  Here it is helpful to make a change of variables</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%28r%29+%3D+%5CPsi%28r%29%2Fr+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="u(r) = &#92;Psi(r)/r " class="latex" /></p>
<p>At least naively, Schr&ouml;dinger&#8217;s equation for the particle in the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=cr%5E%7B-2%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="cr^{-2}" class="latex" /> potential then becomes</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7Bd%7D%7Bdt%7D+u+%3D+-iH+u+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{d}{dt} u = -iH u }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>where</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+H+%3D+-%5Cfrac%7Bd%5E2%7D%7Bdr%5E2%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7Bc+%2B+%5Cell%28%5Cell%2B1%29%7D%7Br%5E2%7D+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ H = -&#92;frac{d^2}{dr^2} + &#92;frac{c + &#92;ell(&#92;ell+1)}{r^2} }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>Beware: I keep calling all sorts of different but related Hamiltonians <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="H," class="latex" /> and this one is for the <i>radial part</i> of the dynamics of a quantum particle in an inverse cube force.  As we&#8217;ve seen before in the classical case, the centrifugal force and the inverse cube force join forces in an &#8216;effective potential&#8217;</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+U%28r%29+%3D+kr%5E%7B-2%7D+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ U(r) = kr^{-2} } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>where</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k+%3D+c+%2B+%5Cell%28%5Cell%2B1%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k = c + &#92;ell(&#92;ell+1)" class="latex" /></p>
<p>So, we have reduced the problem to that of a particle on the open half-line <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%280%2C%5Cinfty%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(0,&#92;infty)" class="latex" /> moving in the potential <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=kr%5E%7B-2%7D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="kr^{-2}." class="latex" /> The Hamiltonian for this problem:</p>

<p>is called the <b>Calogero Hamiltonian</b>.  Needless to say, it has fascinating and somewhat scary properties, since to make it into a bona fide self-adjoint operator, we must make some choice about what happens when the particle hits <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r+%3D+0.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r = 0." class="latex" />  The formula above does not really specify the Hamiltonian.</p>
<p>This is more or less where Gitman, Tyutin and Voronov <i>begin</i> their analysis, after a long and pleasant review of the problem.  They describe all the possible choices of self-adjoint operator that are allowed.  The answer depends on the values of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k," class="latex" /> but very crudely, the choice says something like how the phase of your particle changes when it bounces off the singularity.  Most choices break the dilation invariance of the problem.  But intriguingly, some choices retain invariance under a <i>discrete subgroup</i> of dilations!</p>
<p>So, the rabbit hole of the inverse cube force law goes quite deep, and I expect I haven&#8217;t quite gotten to the bottom yet.  The problem may seem pathological, verging on pointless. But the math is fascinating, and it&#8217;s a great testing-ground for ideas in quantum mechanics&mdash;very manageable compared to deeper subjects like quantum field theory, which are riddled with their own pathologies.  Finally, the connection between the inverse cube force law and centrifugal force makes me think it&#8217;s not a mere curiosity.</p>
<h3> In four dimensions </h3>
<p>It&#8217;s a bit odd to study the inverse cube force law in <i>3-dimensonal</i> space, since Newtonian gravity and the electrostatic force would actually obey an inverse cube law in <i>4-dimensional</i> space.  For the classical 2-body problem it doesn&#8217;t matter much whether you&#8217;re in 3d or 4d space, since the motion stays on the plane.  But for quantum 2-body problem it makes more of a difference!</p>
<p>Just for the record, let me say how the quantum 2-body problem works in 4 dimensions.  As before, we can work in the center of mass frame and consider this Hamiltonian:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H+%3D+-%5Cnabla%5E2+%2B+c+r%5E%7B-2%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="H = -&#92;nabla^2 + c r^{-2}" class="latex" /></p>
<p>And as before, the behavior of this Hamiltonian depends on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c." class="latex" />  Here&#8217;s the story this time:</p>
<p>&bull; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+%5Cge+0.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c &#92;ge 0." class="latex" />  In this case <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="H" class="latex" /> is essentially self-adjoint on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_0%5E%5Cinfty%28%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E4+-+%5C%7B0%5C%7D%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C_0^&#92;infty(&#92;mathbb{R}^4 - &#92;{0&#92;})." class="latex" />  So, it admits a unique self-adjoint extension and there&#8217;s no ambiguity about this case.</p>
<p>&bull; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+%3C+0.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c &lt; 0." class="latex" />  In this case <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="H" class="latex" /> is not essentially self-adjoint on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_0%5E%5Cinfty%28%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E4+-+%5C%7B0%5C%7D%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C_0^&#92;infty(&#92;mathbb{R}^4 - &#92;{0&#92;})." class="latex" /></p>
<p>&bull; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+%5Cge+-1.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c &#92;ge -1." class="latex" />  In this case the expected energy <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5Cpsi%2C+H+%5Cpsi+%5Crangle+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;langle &#92;psi, H &#92;psi &#92;rangle " class="latex" /> is bounded below for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpsi+%5Cin+C_0%5E%5Cinfty%28%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E3+-+%5C%7B0%5C%7D%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;psi &#92;in C_0^&#92;infty(&#92;mathbb{R}^3 - &#92;{0&#92;})." class="latex" />   So, there is exists a canonical &#8216;best choice&#8217; of self-adjoint extension, called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrichs_extension">Friedrichs extension</a>.</p>
<p>&bull; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+%3C+-1.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c &lt; -1." class="latex" />  In this case the expected energy is not bounded below, so we don&#8217;t have the Friedrichs extension to help us choose which self-adjoint extension is &#8216;best&#8217;.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Some butterflies have shiny, vividly colored wings. From different angles you see different colors. This effect is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridescence">iridescence</a>. How does it work?</p>
<p>It turns out these butterfly wings are made of very fancy materials! Light bounces around inside these materials in a tricky way. Sunlight of different colors winds up reflecting off these materials in different directions.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re starting to understand the materials and make similar substances in the lab. They&#8217;re called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photonic_crystal">photonic crystals</a>. They have amazing properties.</p>
<p>Here at the <a href="http://www.quantumlah.org/">Centre for Quantum Technologies</a> we have people studying exotic materials of many kinds. Next door, there&#8217;s a lab completely devoted to studying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphene">graphene</a>: crystal sheets of carbon in which electrons can move as if they were massless particles! Graphene has a lot of potential for building new technologies&#8212;that&#8217;s why Singapore is pumping money into researching it.</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/graphene.jpg" alt="" width="450" /></div>
<p><a href="http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2015/Weyl-points-detected-0716">Some physicists at MIT</a> just showed that one of the materials in butterfly wings might act like a 3d form of graphene. In graphene, electrons can only move easily in 2 directions. In this new material, electrons could move in all 3 directions, acting as if they had no mass.</p>
<p>The pictures here show the microscopic structure of two materials found in butterfly wings:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/gyroid_versus_double_gyroid.jpg" alt="" width="450" /></div>
<p>The picture at left actually shows a sculpture made by the mathematical artist <a href="https://www.bathsheba.com/math/gyroid/">Bathsheba Grossman</a>. But it&#8217;s a piece of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyroid">gyroid</a>: a surface with a very complicated shape, which repeats forever in 3 directions. It&#8217;s called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_surface">minimal surface</a> because you can&#8217;t shrink its area by tweaking it just a little. It divides space into two regions.</p>
<p>The gyroid was discovered in 1970 by a mathematician, Alan Schoen. It&#8217;s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triply_periodic_minimal_surface">triply periodic minimal surfaces</a>, meaning one that repeats itself in 3 different directions in space, like a crystal.</p>
<div align="center"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyroid"><br />
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/gyroid.gif" alt="" /></a></div>
<p>Schoen was working for NASA, and his idea was to use the gyroid for building ultra-light, super-strong structures. But that didn&#8217;t happen. Research doesn&#8217;t move in predictable directions.</p>
<p>In 1983, people discovered that in some mixtures of oil and water, the oil naturally forms a gyroid. The sheets of oil try to minimize their area, so it&#8217;s not surprising that they form a minimal surface. Something else makes this surface be a gyroid&#8212;I&#8217;m not sure what.</p>
<p>Butterfly wings are made of a hard material called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chitin">chitin</a>. Around 2008, people discovered that the chitin in some iridescent butterfly wings is made in a gyroid pattern! The spacing in this pattern is very small, about one wavelength of visible light. This makes light move through this material in a complicated way, which depends on the light&#8217;s color and the direction it&#8217;s moving.</p>
<p>So: <i>butterflies have naturally evolved a photonic crystal based on a gyroid!</i></p>
<p>The universe is awesome, but it&#8217;s not magic. A mathematical pattern is beautiful if it&#8217;s a simple solution to at least one simple problem. This is why beautiful patterns naturally bring themselves into existence: they&#8217;re the simplest ways for certain things to happen. Darwinian evolution helps out: it scans through trillions of possibilities and finds solutions to problems. So, we should <i>expect</i> life to be packed with mathematically beautiful patterns&#8230; and it is.</p>
<p>The picture at right above shows a &#8216;double gyroid&#8217;. Here it is again:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/double_gyroid.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p>This is actually two interlocking surfaces, shown in red and blue.  You can get them by writing the gyroid as a level surface:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%2Cy%2Cz%29+%3D+0+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f(x,y,z) = 0 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>and taking the two nearby surfaces</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%2Cy%2Cz%29+%3D+%5Cpm+c+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f(x,y,z) = &#92;pm c " class="latex" /></p>
<p>for some small value of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c." class="latex" />.</p>
<p>It turns out that while they&#8217;re still growing, some butterflies have a double gyroid pattern in their wings. This turns into a single gyroid when they grow up!</p>
<p>The new research at MIT studied how an electron would move through a double gyroid pattern. They calculated its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersion_relation">dispersion relation</a>: how the speed of the electron would depend on its energy and the direction it&#8217;s moving.</p>
<p>An ordinary particle moves faster if it has more energy. But a massless particle, like a photon, moves at the same speed no matter what energy it has. The MIT team showed that an electron in a double gyroid pattern moves at a speed that doesn&#8217;t depend much on its energy. So, in some ways this electron acts like a massless particle.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s quite different than a photon. It&#8217;s actually more like a neutrino! You see, unlike photons, electrons and neutrinos are spin-1/2 particles.  Neutrinos are almost massless.  A massless spin-1/2 particle can have a built-in handedness, spinning in only one direction around its axis of motion. Such a particle is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weyl_equation">Weyl spinor</a>. The MIT team showed that a electron moving through a double gyroid acts approximately like a Weyl spinor!</p>
<p>How does this work?  Well, the key fact is that the double gyroid has a built-in handedness, or chirality.  It comes in a left-handed and right-handed form.  You can see the handedness quite clearly in Grossman&#8217;s sculpture of the ordinary gyroid:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="https://www.bathsheba.com/math/gyroid/"><img width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/gyroid_hex.jpg" alt="" /></a></div>
<p>Beware: nobody has actually made electrons act like Weyl spinors in the lab yet. The MIT team just found a way that should work.  Someday someone will actually make it happen, probably in less than a decade. And later, someone will do amazing things with this ability. I don&#8217;t know what. Maybe the butterflies know!</p>

<p>The paper by Michielsen and Stavenga is free online!  They say the famous &#8216;blue Morpho&#8217; butterfly shown in the picture at the top of this article does <i>not</i> use a gyroid; it uses a &#8220;two-dimensional photonic crystal slab consisting of arrays of rectangles formed by lamellae and microribs.&#8221;  But they find gyroids in four other species: <i>Callophrys rubi</i>, <i>Cyanophrys remus</i>, <i>Pardes sesostris</i> and <i>Teinopalpus imperialis</i>. It compares tunnelling electron microscope pictures of slices of their iridescent patches with computer-generated slices of gyroids. The comparison looks pretty good to me:</p>

<p>Again, the first is free online. There&#8217;s a lot of great math lurking inside, most of which is too mind-blowing too explain quickly. Let me just paraphrase the start of the paper, so at least experts can get the idea:</p>
<blockquote><p>Two-dimensional (2d) electrons and photons at the energies and frequencies of Dirac points exhibit extraordinary features. As the best example, almost all the remarkable properties of graphene are tied to the massless Dirac fermions at its Fermi level. Topologically, Dirac cones are not only the critical points for 2d phase transitions but also the unique surface manifestation of a topologically gapped 3d bulk. In a similar way, it is expected that if a material could be found that exhibits a 3d linear dispersion relation, it would also display a wide range of interesting physics phenomena. The associated 3D linear point degeneracies are called “Weyl points”. In the past year, there have been a few studies of Weyl fermions in electronics. The associated Fermi-arc surface states, quantum Hall effect, novel transport properties and a realization of the Adler&#8211;Bell&#8211;Jackiw anomaly are also expected. However, no observation of Weyl points has been reported. Here, we present a theoretical discovery and detailed numerical investigation of frequency-isolated Weyl points in perturbed double-gyroid photonic crystals along with their complete phase diagrams and their topologically protected surface states.</p></blockquote>
<p>Also a bit for the mathematicians:</p>
<blockquote><p>Weyl points are topologically stable objects in the 3d Brillouin zone: they act as monopoles of Berry flux in momentum space, and hence are intimately related to the topological invariant known as the Chern number. The Chern number can be defined for a single bulk band or a set of bands, where the Chern numbers of the individual bands are summed, on any closed 2d surface in the 3d Brillouin zone. The difference of the Chern numbers defined on two surfaces, of all bands below the Weyl point frequencies, equals the sum of the chiralities of the Weyl points enclosed in between the two surfaces.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a mix of topology and physics jargon that may be hard for pure mathematicians to understand, but I&#8217;ll be glad to translate if there&#8217;s interest.</p>
<p>For starters, a &#8216;monopole of Berry flux in momentum space&#8217; is a poetic way of talking about a twisted complex line bundle over the space of allowed energy-momenta of the electron in the double gyroid. We get a twist at every &#8216;Weyl point&#8217;, meaning a point where the dispersion relations look locally like those of a Weyl spinor when its energy-momentum is near zero. Near such a point, the dispersion relations are a Fourier-transformed version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weyl_equation">Weyl equation</a>.</p>

					<p>Here&#8217;s a puzzle from a recent issue of <i>Quanta</i>, an online science magazine:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <strong>Puzzle 1</strong>: I write down two different numbers that are completely unknown to you, and hold one in my left hand and one in my right. You have absolutely no idea how I generated these two numbers. Which is larger?</p>
<p>  You can point to one of my hands, and I will show you the number in it. Then you can decide to either select the number you have seen or switch to the number you have not seen, held in the other hand.  Is there a strategy that will give you a greater than 50% chance of choosing the larger number, no matter which two numbers I write down?
</p></blockquote>
<p>At first it seems the answer is no.  Whatever number you see, the other number could be larger or smaller.  There&#8217;s no way to tell.  So obviously you can&#8217;t get a better than 50% chance of picking the hand with the largest number&#8212;even if you&#8217;ve seen one of those numbers!</p>
<p>But &#8220;obviously&#8221; is not a proof.  Sometimes &#8220;obvious&#8221; things are wrong!</p>
<p>It turns out that, amazingly, the answer to the puzzle is <i>yes!</i>  You can find a strategy to do better than 50%.  But the strategy uses randomness.  So, this puzzle is a great illustration of the power of randomness.</p>
<p>If you want to solve it yourself, stop now or read <i>Quanta</i> magazine for some clues&#8212;they offered a small prize for the best answer:</p>
<p>&bull;  Pradeep Mutalik, <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/20150707-can-information-rise-from-randomness/">Can information rise from randomness?</a>, <i>Quanta</i>, 7 July 2015.</p>
<p>Greg Egan gave a nice solution in the comments to this magazine article, and I&#8217;ll reprint it below along with two followup puzzles.  So don&#8217;t look down there unless you want a spoiler.</p>
<p>I should add: the most common mistake among educated readers seems to be assuming that the first player, the one who chooses the two numbers, chooses them according to some probability distribution.  Don&#8217;t assume that.  They are simply <i>arbitrary numbers</i>.</p>
<h3> The history of this puzzle </h3>
<p>I&#8217;d seen this puzzle before&#8212;do you know who invented it?  <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/117663015413546257905/posts/EVYdMhSqtWu">On G+</a>, Hans Havermann wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I believe the origin of this puzzle goes back to (at least) John Fox and Gerald Marnie&#8217;s 1958 betting game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_problem#The_game_of_googol">&#8216;Googol&#8217;</a>. Martin Gardner mentioned it in his February 1960 column in <em>Scientific American</em>. Wikipedia mentions it under the heading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_problem#The_game_of_googol">&#8216;Secretary problem&#8217;</a>. Gardner suggested that a variant of the game was proposed by Arthur Cayley in 1875.﻿
</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually the game of Googol is a <em>generalization</em> of the puzzle that we&#8217;ve been discussing.  Martin Gardner explained it thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Ask someone to take as many slips of paper as he pleases, and on each slip write a different positive number. The numbers may range from small fractions of 1 to a number the size of a googol (1 followed by a hundred 0s) or even larger. These slips are turned face down and shuffled over the top of a table. One at a time you turn the slips face up. The aim is to stop turning when you come to the number that you guess to be the largest of the series. You cannot go back and pick a previously turned slip. If you turn over all the slips, then of course you must pick the last one turned.
</p></blockquote>
<p>So, the puzzle I just showed you is the special case when there are just 2 slips of paper.  I seem to recall that Gardner incorrectly dismissed this case as trivial!</p>
<p>There&#8217;s been a lot of work on Googol.   Julien Berestycki writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I heard about this puzzle a few years ago from Sasha Gnedin.  He has a very nice paper about this</p>
<p>  &bull; Alexander V. Gnedin, <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aop/1176988613">A solution to the game of Googol</a>, <i>Annals of Probability</i> (1994), 1588&#8211;1595.</p>
<p>  One of the many beautiful ideas in this paper is that it asks what is the best strategy for the guy who writes the numbers! It also cites a paper by Gnedin and Berezowskyi (of oligarchic fame). ﻿
</p></blockquote>
<h3> Egan&#8217;s solution </h3>
<p>Okay, here is Greg Egan&#8217;s solution, paraphrased a bit:</p>
<p>Pick some function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f+%3A+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D+%5Cto+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f : &#92;mathbb{R} &#92;to &#92;mathbb{R}" class="latex" /> such that:</p>
<p>&bull; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Clim_%7Bx+%5Cto+-%5Cinfty%7D+f%28x%29+%3D+0+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;lim_{x &#92;to -&#92;infty} f(x) = 0 }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>&bull; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Clim_%7Bx+%5Cto+%2B%5Cinfty%7D+f%28x%29+%3D+1+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;lim_{x &#92;to +&#92;infty} f(x) = 1 }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>&bull; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" /> is strictly increasing: if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%3E+y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x &gt; y" class="latex" /> then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%29+%3E+f%28y%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f(x) &gt; f(y)" class="latex" /></p>
<p>There are lots of functions like this, for example</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7Bf%28x%29+%3D+%5Cfrac%7Be%5Ex%7D%7Be%5Ex+%2B+1%7D+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{f(x) = &#92;frac{e^x}{e^x + 1} }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>Next, pick one of the first player&#8217;s hands at random. If the number you are shown is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a," class="latex" /> compute <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28a%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f(a)." class="latex" />  Then generate a uniformly distributed random number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="z" class="latex" /> between 0 and 1.  If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="z" class="latex" /> is less than or equal to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28a%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f(a)" class="latex" /> guess that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> is the larger number, but if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="z" class="latex" /> is greater than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28a%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f(a)" class="latex" /> guess that the larger number is in the other hand.</p>
<p>The probability of guessing correctly can be calculated as the probability of seeing the larger number initially and then, correctly, sticking with it, plus the probability of seeing the smaller number initially and then, correctly, choosing the other hand.</p>
<p>Say the larger number is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> and the smaller one is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y." class="latex" />  Then the probability of guessing correctly is</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D+f%28x%29+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D+%281+-+f%28y%29%29+%3D++%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D+%28f%28x%29+-+f%28y%29%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;frac{1}{2} f(x) + &#92;frac{1}{2} (1 - f(y)) =  &#92;frac{1}{2} + &#92;frac{1}{2} (f(x) - f(y)) " class="latex" /></p>
<p>This is strictly greater than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;frac{1}{2}" class="latex" /> since <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%3E+y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x &gt; y" class="latex" /> so <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%29+-+f%28y%29+%3E+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f(x) - f(y) &gt; 0" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>So, you have a more than 50% chance of winning!  But as you play the game, there&#8217;s no way to tell how much more than 50%.  If the numbers on the other players hands are very large, or very small, your chance will be just slightly more than 50%.</p>
<h3> Followup puzzles </h3>
<p>Here are two more puzzles:</p>
<p><strong>Puzzle 2:</strong> Prove that no deterministic strategy can guarantee you have a more than 50% chance of choosing the larger number.</p>
<p><strong>Puzzle 3:</strong> There are perfectly specific but &#8216;algorithmically random&#8217; sequences of bits, which can&#8217;t predicted well by any program.  If we use these to generate a uniform algorithmically random number between 0 and 1, and use the strategy Egan describes, will our chance of choosing the larger number be more than 50%, or not?﻿</p>
<p>But watch out&#8212;here come Egan&#8217;s solutions to those!</p>
<h3> Solutions </h3>
<p>Egan writes:</p>
<blockquote><p> Here are my answers to your two puzzles on G+.</p>
<p><b>Puzzle 2:</b><b> Prove that no deterministic strategy can guarantee you have a more than 50% chance of choosing the larger number.</p>
<p></b><b>Answer:</b> If we adopt a deterministic strategy, that means there is a function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%3A+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D+%5Cto+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S: &#92;mathbb{R} &#92;to &#92;{0,1&#92;}" class="latex" /> that tells us whether on not we stick with the number x when we see it.  If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%28x%29%3D1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S(x)=1" class="latex" /> we stick with it, if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%28x%29%3D0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S(x)=0" class="latex" /> we swap it for the other number.</p>
<p>If the two numbers are <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y," class="latex" /> with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%3E+y%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x &gt; y," class="latex" /> then the probability of success will be:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P+%3D+0.5+%2B+0.5%28S%28x%29-S%28y%29%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="P = 0.5 + 0.5(S(x)-S(y))" class="latex" /></p>
<p>This is exactly the same as the formula we obtained when we stuck with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> with probability <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%29%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f(x)," class="latex" /> but we have specialised to functions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S" class="latex" /> valued in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;{0,1&#92;}." class="latex" /></p>
<p>We can only guarantee a more than 50% chance of choosing the larger number if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S" class="latex" /> is monotonically increasing everywhere, i.e. <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%28x%29+%3E+S%28y%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S(x) &gt; S(y)" class="latex" /> whenever <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%3E+y.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x &gt; y." class="latex" />  But this is impossible for a function valued in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;{0,1&#92;}." class="latex" />  To prove this, define <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x_0" class="latex" /> to be any number in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5B1%2C2%5D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="[1,2]" class="latex" /> such that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%28x_0%29%3D0%3B&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S(x_0)=0;" class="latex" /> such an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x_0" class="latex" /> must exist, otherwise <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S" class="latex" /> would be constant on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5B1%2C2%5D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="[1,2]" class="latex" /> and hence not monotonically increasing.  Similarly define <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x_1" class="latex" /> to be any number in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5B-2%2C-1%5D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="[-2,-1]" class="latex" /> such that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%28x_1%29+%3D+1.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S(x_1) = 1." class="latex" />  We then have <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0+%3E+x_1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x_0 &gt; x_1" class="latex" /> but <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%28x_0%29+%3C+S%28x_1%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S(x_0) &lt; S(x_1)." class="latex" /></p>
<p><b>Puzzle 3:</b> There are perfectly specific but &#8216;algorithmically random&#8217; sequences of bits, which can&#8217;t predicted well by any program.  If we use these to generate a uniform algorithmically random number between 0 and 1, and use the strategy Egan describes, will our chance of choosing the larger number be more than 50%, or not?﻿</p>
<p><b>Answer:</b> As Philip Gibbs noted, a deterministic pseudo-random number generator is still deterministic.  Using a specific sequence of algorithmically random bits </p>

<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%28x%29+%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S(x) = 0" class="latex" /> if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%3C+f%5E%7B-1%7D%28z_0%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x &lt; f^{-1}(z_0)" class="latex" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%28x%29+%3D+1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S(x) = 1" class="latex" /> if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%5Cge+f%5E%7B-1%7D%28z_0%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x &#92;ge f^{-1}(z_0)" class="latex" /></p>
<p>So all the same consequences as in Puzzle 2 apply, and we cannot guarantee a more than 50% chance of choosing the larger number.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Puzzle 3 emphasizes the huge gulf between &#8216;true randomness&#8217;, where we only have a probability distribution of numbers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="z," class="latex" /> and the situation where we have a specific number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_0%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="z_0," class="latex" /> generated by any means whatsoever.</p>
<p>We could generate <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="z_0" class="latex" /> using a pseudorandom number generator, radioactive decay of atoms, an oracle whose randomness is certified by all the Greek gods, or whatever.  No matter how randomly <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="z_0" class="latex" /> is generated, once we have it, we know there exist choices for the first player that will guarantee our defeat!</p>
<p>This may seem weird at first, but if you think about simple games of luck you&#8217;ll see it&#8217;s completely ordinary.  We can have a more than 50% chance of winning such a game even if for any particular play we make the other player has a move that ensures our defeat.  That&#8217;s just how randomness works.</p>

				<small>1 July, 2015</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>Here in Copenhagen we&#8217;ll soon be having a bunch of interesting talks on chemical reaction networks:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.math.ku.dk/~efeliu/trendsrnt/index.html">Workshop on Mathematical Trends in Reaction Network Theory</a>, 1-3 July 2015, Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of Copenhagen.  Organized by <a href="http://www.math.ku.dk/~efeliu/">Elisenda Feliu</a> and <a href="http://www.math.ku.dk/~pbx512/">Carsten Wiuf</a>.</p>
<p>Looking through the <a href="http://www.math.ku.dk/~efeliu/trendsrnt/abstracts.html">abstracts</a>, here are a couple that strike me.</p>
<p>First of all, Gheorghe Craciun claims to have proved the biggest open conjecture in this field: the Global Attractor Conjecture!</p>
<p>&bull; Gheorge Craciun, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.02860">Toric differential inclusions and a proof of the global attractor conjecture</a>.</p>
<p>This famous old conjecture says that for a certain class of chemical reactions, the ones coming from &#8216;complex balanced reaction networks&#8217;, the chemicals will approach equilibrium no matter what their initial concentrations are.  Here&#8217;s what Craciun says:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <strong>Abstract.</strong> In a groundbreaking 1972 paper Fritz Horn and Roy Jackson showed that a complex balanced mass-action system must have a unique locally stable equilibrium within any compatibility class. In 1974 Horn conjectured that this equilibrium is a global attractor, i.e., all solutions in the same compatibility class must converge to this equilibrium. Later, this claim was called the Global Attractor Conjecture, and it was shown that it has remarkable implications for the dynamics of large classes of polynomial and power-law dynamical systems, even if they are not derived from mass-action kinetics. Several special cases of this conjecture have been proved during the last decade. We describe a proof of the conjecture in full generality. In particular, it will follow that all detailed balanced mass action systems and all deficiency zero mass-action systems have the global attractor property. We will also discuss some implications for biochemical mechanisms that implement noise filtering and cellular homeostasis.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Manoj Gopalkrishnan wrote a <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2014/01/07/lyapunov-functions-for-complex-balanced-systems/">great post</a> explaining the concept of complex balanced reaction network here on Azimuth, so if you want to understand the conjecture you could start there.</p>
<p>Even better, Manoj is talking here about a way to do statistical inference with chemistry!  His talk is called &#8216;Statistical inference with a chemical soup&#8217;:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <b>Abstract.</b> The goal is to design an “intelligent chemical soup” that can do statistical inference. This may have niche technological applications in medicine and biological research, as well as provide fundamental insight into the workings of biochemical reaction pathways. As a first step towards our goal, we describe a scheme that exploits the remarkable mathematical similarity between log-linear models in statistics and chemical reaction networks. We present a simple scheme that encodes the information in a log-linear model as a chemical reaction network. Observed data is encoded as initial concentrations, and the equilibria of the corresponding mass-action system yield the maximum likelihood estimators. The simplicity of our scheme suggests that molecular environments, especially within cells, may be particularly well suited to performing statistical computations.
</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s based on this paper:</p>
<p>&bull; Manoj Gopalkrishnan, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03172">A scheme for molecular computation of maximum likelihood estimators for log-linear models</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure, but this idea may exploit existing analogies between the approach to equilibrium in chemistry, the approach to equilibrium in evolutionary game theory, and statistical inference.  You may have read <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2014/01/22/relative-entropy-in-evolutionary-dynamics/">Marc Harper&#8217;s post</a> about that stuff!</p>
<p>David Doty is giving a broader review of &#8216;Computation by (not about) chemistry&#8217;:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<b>Abstract.</b> The model of chemical reaction networks (CRNs) is extensively used throughout the natural sciences as a descriptive language for existing chemicals. If we instead think of CRNs as a programming language for describing artificially engineered chemicals, what sorts of computations are possible for these chemicals to achieve? The answer depends crucially on several formal choices:</p>
<p>1) Do we treat matter as infinitely divisible (real-valued concentrations) or atomic (integer-valued counts)?</p>
<p>2) How do we represent the input and output of the computation (e.g., Boolean presence or absence of species, positive numbers directly represented by counts/concentrations, positive and negative numbers represented indirectly by the difference between counts/concentrations of a pair of species)?</p>
<p>3) Do we assume mass-action rate laws (reaction rates proportional to reactant counts/concentrations) or do we insist the system works correctly under a broader class of rate laws? </p>
<p>The talk will survey several recent results and techniques. A primary goal of the talk is to convey the &#8220;programming perspective&#8221;: rather than asking &#8220;What does chemistry do?&#8221;, we want to understand &#8220;What could chemistry do?&#8221; as well as &#8220;What can chemistry provably not do?&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m really interested in chemical reaction networks that appear in biological systems, and there will be lots of talks about that.  For example, Ovidiu Radulescu will talk about &#8216;Taming the complexity of biochemical networks through model reduction and tropical geometry&#8217;.  Model reduction is the process of simplifying complicated models while preserving at least some of their good features.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_geometry">Tropical geometry</a> is a cool version of algebraic geometry that uses the real numbers with <em>minimization</em> as addition and <em>addition</em> as multiplication.  This number system underlies the principle of least action, or the principle of maximum energy.  Here is Radulescu&#8217;s abstract:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<b>Abstract.</b> Biochemical networks are used as models of cellular physiology with diverse applications in biology and medicine. In the absence of objective criteria to detect essential features and prune secondary details, networks generated from data are too big and therefore out of the applicability of many mathematical tools for studying their dynamics and behavior under perturbations. However, under circumstances that we can generically denote by multi-scaleness, large biochemical networks can be approximated by smaller and simpler networks. Model reduction is a way to find these simpler models that can be more easily analyzed. We discuss several model reduction methods for biochemical networks with polynomial or rational rate functions and propose as their common denominator the notion of tropical equilibration, meaning finite intersection of tropical varieties in algebraic geometry. Using tropical methods, one can strongly reduce the number of variables and parameters of biochemical network. For multi-scale networks, these reductions are computed symbolically on orders of magnitude of parameters and variables, and are valid in wide domains of parameter and phase spaces.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m talking about the analogy between probabilities and quantum amplitudes, and how this makes chemistry analogous to particle physics.  You can see two versions of my talk here, but I&#8217;ll be giving the &#8216;more advanced&#8217; version, which is new:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/prob/">Probabilities versus amplitudes</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <strong>Abstract.</strong> Some ideas from quantum theory are just beginning to percolate back to classical probability theory. For example, the master equation for a chemical reaction network describes the interactions of molecules in a stochastic rather than quantum way. If we look at it from the perspective of quantum theory, this formalism turns out to involve creation and annihilation operators, coherent states and other well-known ideas&#8212;but with a few big differences.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Anyway, there are a lot more talks, but if I don&#8217;t have breakfast and walk over to the math department, I&#8217;ll miss those talks!</p>
<p>You can learn more about individual talks in the comments here (see below) and also in Matteo Polettini&#8217;s blog:</p>

</div>
<p>Today I&#8217;m going to this workshop:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://hdra15.gforge.inria.fr/">Higher-Dimensional Rewriting and Applications</a>, 28-29 June 2015, Warsaw, Poland.</p>
<p>Many of the talks will be interesting to people who are trying to use category theory as a tool for modelling networks!</p>
<p>For example, though they can&#8217;t actually attend, Lucius Meredith and my student Mike Stay hope to use Google Hangouts to present their work on <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.04311">Higher category models of the π-calculus</a>.  The π-calculus is a way of modelling networks where messages get sent here and there, e.g. the internet.   Check out Mike&#8217;s blog post about this:</p>
<p>&bull; Mike Stay, <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2015/05/a_2categorical_approach_to_the.html">A 2-categorical approach to the pi calculus</a>, <i>The n-Category Caf&eacute;</i>, 26 May 2015.</p>
<p>Krzysztof Bar, Aleks Kissinger and Jamie Vicary will be speaking about Globular, a proof assistant for computations in n-categories:</p>
<blockquote><p>
This talk is a progress report on Globular, an online proof assistant for semistrict higher-dimensional rewriting. We aim to produce a tool which can visualize higher-dimensional categorical diagrams, assist in their construction with a point-and-click interface, perform type checking to prevent incorrect composites, and automatically handle the interchanger data at each dimension. Hosted on the web, it will have a low barrier to use, and allow hyperlinking of formalized proofs directly from research papers. We outline the theoretical basis for the tool, and describe the challenges we have overcome in its design.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Eric Finster will be talking about another computer system for dealing with n-categories, based on the &#8216;opetopic&#8217; formalism that James Dolan and I invented.  And Jason Morton is working on a computer system for computation in compact closed categories!  I&#8217;ve seen it, and it&#8217;s cool, but he can&#8217;t attend the workshop, so David Spivak will be speaking on his work with Jason on the theoretical foundations of this software:</p>
<blockquote><p> We consider the linked problems of (1) finding a normal form for morphism expressions in a closed compact category and (2) the word problem, that is deciding if two morphism expressions are equal up to the axioms of a closed compact category. These are important ingredients for a practical monoidal category computer algebra system. Previous approaches to these problems include rewriting and graph-based methods. Our approach is to re-interpret a morphism expression in terms of an operad, and thereby obtain a single composition which is strictly associative and applied according to the abstract syntax tree. This yields the same final operad morphism regardless of the tree representation of the expression or order of execution, and solves the normal form problem up to automorphism.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Recently Eugenia Cheng has been popularizing category theory, touring to promote her book <i><a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/content/book-review-cakes-custard-and-category-theory-by-eugenia-cheng">Cakes, Custard and Category Theory</a></i>.  But she&#8217;ll be giving two talks in Warsaw, I believe on <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/distributive+law">distributive laws</a> for <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Lawvere+theory#idea">Lawvere theories</a>.</p>
<p>As for me, I&#8217;ll be promoting my dream of using category theory to understand networks in electrical engineering.  I&#8217;ll be giving a talk on control theory and a talk on electrical circuits: two sides of the same coin, actually.</p>
<p>&bull; John Baez, Jason Erbele and Nick Woods, <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks_warsaw/control_web_warsaw.pdf">Categories in control</a>.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve seen a previous talk of mine with the same title, don&#8217;t despair&#8212;this one has new stuff!  In particular, it talks about a new paper by Nick Woods and Simon Wadsley.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<b>Abstract.</b>  Control theory is the branch of engineering that studies dynamical systems with inputs and outputs, and seeks to stabilize these using feedback. Control theory uses &#8220;signal-flow diagrams&#8221; to describe processes where real-valued functions of time are added, multiplied by scalars, differentiated and integrated, duplicated and deleted. In fact, these are string diagrams for the symmetric monoidal category of finite-dimensional vector spaces, but where the monoidal structure is direct sum rather than the usual tensor product. Jason Erbele has given a presentation for this symmetric monoidal category, which amounts to saying that it is the PROP for bicommutative bimonoids with some extra structure.</p>
<p>A broader class of signal-flow diagrams also includes &#8220;caps&#8221; and &#8220;cups&#8221; to model feedback. This amounts to working with a larger symmetric monoidal category where objects are still finite-dimensional vector spaces but the morphisms are linear relations. Erbele also found a presentation for this larger symmetric monoidal category. It is the PROP for a remarkable thing: roughly speaking, an object with two special commutative dagger-Frobenius structures, such that the multiplication and unit of either one and the comultiplication and counit of the other fit together to form a bimonoid.
</p></blockquote>
<p>&bull; John Baez and Brendan Fong, <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks_warsaw/circuits_web_warsaw.pdf">Circuits, categories and rewrite rules</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<b>Abstract.</b> We describe a category where a morphism is an electrical circuit made of resistors, inductors and capacitors, with marked input and output terminals. In this category we compose morphisms by attaching the outputs of one circuit to the inputs of another. There is a functor called the &#8216;black box functor&#8217; that takes a circuit, forgets its internal structure, and remembers only its external behavior. Two circuits have the same external behavior if and only if they impose same relation between currents and potentials at their terminals. This is a linear relation, so the black box functor goes from the category of circuits to the category of finite-dimensional vector spaces and linear relations. Constructing this functor makes use of Brendan Fong&#8217;s theory of &#8216;decorated cospans&#8217;&#8212;and the question of whether two &#8216;planar&#8217; circuits map to the same relation has an interesting answer in terms of rewrite rules.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The answer to the last question, in the form of a single picture, is this:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks_warsaw/circuit_rules.jpg"><br />
<img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks_warsaw/circuit_rules.jpg" /></a>
</div>
<p>(Click to enlarge.)  How can you change an electrical circuit made out of resistors without changing what it does?  5 ways are shown here:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can remove a loop of wire with a resistor on it.  It doesn&#8217;t do anything.</li>
<li>You can remove a wire with a resistor on it if one end is unattached.  Again, it doesn&#8217;t do anything.</li>
<li>You can take two resistors in series&#8212;one after the other&#8212;and replace them with a single resistor.  But this new resistor must have a resistance that&#8217;s the sum of the old two.</li>
<li>You can take two resistors in parallel and replace them with a single resistor.  But this resistor must have a conductivity that&#8217;s the sum of the old two.  (Conductivity is the reciprocal of resistance.)</li>
<li>Finally, the really cool part: the <b>Y-Δ transform</b>.  You can replace a Y made of 3 resistors by a triangle of resistors  But their resistances must be related by the equations shown here.</li>
</ol>
<p>For circuits drawn on the plane, these are all the rules you need!  This was proved here:</p>
<p>&bull; Yves Colin de Verdi&egrave;re, Isidoro Gitler and Dirk Vertigan, <a href="http://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~ycolver/All-Articles/96c.pdf">R&eacute;seaux &eacute;lectriques planaires II</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just the beginning of a cool story, which I haven&#8217;t completely blended with the categorical approach to circuits.  Doing so clearly calls for 2-categories: those double arrows are 2-morphisms!  For more, see:</p>

					<p>Eric Drexler likes to say: engineering is dual to science, because science tries to understand what the world does, while engineering is about getting the world to do what you want.  I think we need a slightly less &#8216;coercive&#8217;, more &#8216;cooperative&#8217; approach to the world in order to develop &#8216;ecotechnology&#8217;, but it&#8217;s still a useful distinction.</p>
<p>For example, classical mechanics is the study of what things do when they follow Newton&#8217;s laws.  Control theory is the study of <i>what you can get them to do.</i></p>
<p>Say you have an upside-down pendulum on a cart.  Classical mechanics says what it will do.  But control theory says: if you watch the pendulum and use what you see to move the cart back and forth correctly, <i>you can make sure the pendulum doesn&#8217;t fall over!</i></p>
<p>Control theorists do their work with the help of &#8216;signal-flow diagrams&#8217;.  For example, here is the signal-flow diagram for an inverted pendulum on a cart:</p>

<img src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/inverted_pendulum.jpg" />
</div>
<p>When I take a look at a diagram like this, I say to myself: <i>that&#8217;s a string diagram for a morphism in a monoidal category!</i>  And it&#8217;s true.  Jason Erbele wrote a paper explaining this.  Independently, Bonchi, Soboci&#324;ski and Zanasi did some closely related work:</p>
<p>&bull; John Baez and Jason Erbele, <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/04/23/categories-in-control-2/">Categories in control</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll explain some of the ideas at the <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks_isi/">Turin meeting</a> on the categorical foundations of network theory.  But I also want to talk about this new paper that <a href="https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~sjw47/">Simon Wadsley</a> of Cambridge University wrote with my student <a href="http://mathdept.ucr.edu/gradwebpages/woods.html">Nick Woods</a>:</p>
<p>&bull; Simon Wadsley and Nick Woods, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00048">PROPs for linear systems</a>.</p>
<p>This makes the picture neater and more general!</p>
<p>You see, Jason and I used signal flow diagrams to give a new description of the category of finite-dimensional vector spaces and linear maps.  This category plays a big role in the control theory of linear systems.  Bonchi, Soboci&#324;ski and Zanasi gave a closely related description of an equivalent category, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BMat%7D%28k%29%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{Mat}(k)," class="latex" /> where:</p>
<p>&bull; objects are natural numbers, and</p>
<p>&bull; a morphism <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f+%3A+m+%5Cto+n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f : m &#92;to n" class="latex" /> is an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%5Ctimes+m&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n &#92;times m" class="latex" /> matrix with entries in the field <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k," class="latex" /></p>
<p>and composition is given by matrix multiplication.</p>
<p>But Wadsley and Woods generalized all this work to cover <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BMat%7D%28R%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{Mat}(R)" class="latex" /> whenever <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="R" class="latex" /> is a commutative rig.   A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiring"><b>rig</b></a> is a &#8216;ring without negatives&#8217;&#8212;like the natural numbers.  We can multiply matrices valued in any rig, and this includes some very useful examples&#8230; as I&#8217;ll explain later.</p>
<p>Wadsley and Woods proved:</p>
<p><b>Theorem.</b> Whenever <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="R" class="latex" /> is a commutative rig, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BMat%7D%28R%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{Mat}(R)" class="latex" /> is the PROP for bicommutative bimonoids over <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="R." class="latex" /></p>
<p>This result is quick to state, but it takes a bit of explaining!  So, let me start by bringing in some definitions.</p>
<h3> Bicommutative bimonoids </h3>
<p>We will work in any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_monoidal_category">symmetric monoidal category</a>, and draw morphisms as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_diagram">string diagrams</a>.</p>
<p>A <b>commutative monoid</b> is an object equipped with a <b>multiplication</b>:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="90" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/generator_addition.jpg" />
</div>
<p>and a <b>unit</b>:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="60" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/generator_zero.jpg" />
</div>
<p>obeying these laws:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_commutative_monoid.jpg" />
</div>
<p>For example, suppose <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BFinVect%7D_k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{FinVect}_k" class="latex" /> is the symmetric monoidal category of finite-dimensional vector spaces over a field <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" />, with <i>direct sum</i> as its tensor product.  Then any object <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V+%5Cin+%5Cmathrm%7BFinVect%7D_k+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="V &#92;in &#92;mathrm{FinVect}_k " class="latex" /> is a commutative monoid where the multiplication is <b>addition</b>:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2Cy%29+%5Cmapsto+x+%2B+y+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(x,y) &#92;mapsto x + y " class="latex" /></p>
<p>and the unit is <b>zero</b>: that is, the unique map from the zero-dimensional vector space to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="V." class="latex" /></p>
<p>Turning all this upside down, <b>cocommutative comonoid</b> has a <b>comultiplication</b>:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="110" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/generator_diagonal.jpg" />
</div>
<p>and a <b>counit</b>:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="50" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/generator_deletion.jpg" />
</div>
<p>obeying these laws:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_cocommutative_comonoid.jpg" />
</div>
<p>For example, consider our vector space <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V+%5Cin+%5Cmathrm%7BFinVect%7D_k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="V &#92;in &#92;mathrm{FinVect}_k" class="latex" /> again.  It&#8217;s a commutative comonoid where the comultiplication is <b>duplication</b>:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%5Cmapsto+%28x%2Cx%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x &#92;mapsto (x,x) " class="latex" /></p>
<p>and the counit is <b>deletion</b>: that is, the unique map from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="V" class="latex" /> to the zero-dimensional vector space.</p>
<p>Given an object that&#8217;s both a commutative monoid and a cocommutative comonoid, we say it&#8217;s a <b>bicommutative bimonoid</b> if these extra axioms hold:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="150" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_bimonoid_1.jpg" />
</div>
<div align="center">
<img width="300" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_bimonoid_2.jpg" />
</div>
<p>You can check that these are true for our running example of a finite-dimensional vector space <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="V." class="latex" />  The most exciting one is the top one, which says that adding two vectors and then duplicating the result is the same as duplicating each one, then adding them appropriately.</p>
<p>Our example has some other properties, too!  Each element <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+%5Cin+k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c &#92;in k" class="latex" /> defines a morphism from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="V" class="latex" /> to itself, namely scalar multiplication by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%3A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c:" class="latex" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%5Cmapsto+c+x+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x &#92;mapsto c x " class="latex" /></p>
<p>We draw this as follows:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="60" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/generator_scalar_mult.jpg" />
</div>
<p>These morphisms are compatible with the ones so far:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="300" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_linearity_1.jpg" />
</div>
<div align="center">
<img width="300" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_linearity_2.jpg" />
</div>
<p>Moreover, all the &#8216;rig operations&#8217; in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" />&#8212;that is, addition, multiplication, 0 and 1, but not subtraction or division&#8212;can be recovered from what we have so far:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="300" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_rig_1.jpg" />
</div>
<div align="center">
<img width="200" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_rig_2.jpg" />
</div>
<p>We summarize this by saying our vector space <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="V" class="latex" /> is a bicommutative bimonoid &#8216;over <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" />&#8216;.</p>
<p>More generally, suppose we have a bicommutative bimonoid <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> in a symmetric monoidal category.  Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BEnd%7D%28A%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{End}(A)" class="latex" /> be the set of bicommutative bimonoid homomorphisms from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> to itself.  This is actually a rig: there&#8217;s a way to add these homomorphisms, and also a way to &#8216;multiply&#8217; them (namely, <i>compose</i> them).</p>
<p>Suppose <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="R" class="latex" /> is any commutative rig.  Then we say <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> is a bicommutative bimonoid <b>over <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="R" class="latex" /></b> if it&#8217;s equipped with a rig homomorphism</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CPhi+%3A+R+%5Cto+%5Cmathrm%7BEnd%7D%28A%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;Phi : R &#92;to &#92;mathrm{End}(A)" class="latex" /></p>
<p>This is a way of summarizing the diagrams I just showed you!  You see, each <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+%5Cin+R&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c &#92;in R" class="latex" /> gives a morphism from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> to itself, which we write as</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="60" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/generator_scalar_mult.jpg" />
</div>
<p>The fact that this is a bicommutative bimonoid endomorphism says precisely this:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="300" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_linearity_1.jpg" />
</div>
<div align="center">
<img width="300" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_linearity_2.jpg" />
</div>
<p>And the fact that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CPhi&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;Phi" class="latex" /> is a rig homomorphism says precisely this:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="300" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_rig_1.jpg" />
</div>
<div align="center">
<img width="200" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_rig_2.jpg" />
</div>
<p>So sometimes the right word is worth a dozen pictures!</p>
<p>What Jason and I showed is that for any field <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k," class="latex" /> the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BFinVect%7D_k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{FinVect}_k" class="latex" /> is the free symmetric monoidal category on a bicommutative bimonoid over <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k." class="latex" />  This means that the above rules, which are rules for manipulating signal flow diagrams, <i>completely characterize the world of linear algebra!</i></p>
<p>Bonchi, Soboci&#324;ski and Zanasi used &#8216;PROPs&#8217; to prove a similar result where the field is replaced by a sufficiently nice commutative ring.  And Wadlsey and Woods used PROPS to generalize even further to the case of an arbitrary commutative <i>rig!</i></p>
<p>But what are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRO_%28category_theory%29">PROPs</a>?</p>
<h3> PROPs </h3>
<p>A <b>PROP</b> is a particularly tractable sort of symmetric monoidal category: a strict symmetric monoidal category where the objects are natural numbers and the tensor product of objects is given by ordinary addition.  The symmetric monoidal category <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BFinVect%7D_k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{FinVect}_k" class="latex" /> is equivalent to the PROP <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BMat%7D%28k%29%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{Mat}(k)," class="latex" /> where a morphism <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f+%3A+m+%5Cto+n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f : m &#92;to n" class="latex" /> is an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%5Ctimes+m&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n &#92;times m" class="latex" /> matrix with entries in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k," class="latex" /> composition of morphisms is given by matrix multiplication, and the tensor product of morphisms is the direct sum of matrices.</p>

</div>
<p>This is a great result because it includes some nice new examples.</p>
<p>First, the commutative rig of natural numbers gives a PROP <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BMat%7D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{Mat}." class="latex" />  This is equivalent to the symmetric monoidal category <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BFinSpan%7D%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{FinSpan}," class="latex" /> where morphisms are isomorphism classes of spans of finite sets, with disjoint union as the tensor product.  Steve Lack had already shown that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BFinSpan%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{FinSpan}" class="latex" /> is the PROP for bicommutative bimonoids.  But this also follows from the result of Wadsley and Woods, since every bicommutative bimonoid <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="V" class="latex" /> is automatically equipped with a unique rig homomorphism</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CPhi+%3A+%5Cmathbb%7BN%7D+%5Cto+%5Cmathrm%7BEnd%7D%28V%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;Phi : &#92;mathbb{N} &#92;to &#92;mathrm{End}(V)" class="latex" /></p>
<p>Second, the commutative rig of booleans</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BB%7D+%3D+%5C%7BF%2CT%5C%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{B} = &#92;{F,T&#92;}" class="latex" /></p>
<p>with &#8216;or&#8217; as addition and &#8216;and&#8217; as multiplication gives a PROP <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BMat%7D%28%5Cmathbb%7BB%7D%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{Mat}(&#92;mathbb{B})." class="latex" />  This is equivalent to the symmetric monoidal category <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BFinRel%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{FinRel}" class="latex" /> where morphisms are relations between finite sets, with disjoint union as the tensor product.  Samuel Mimram had already shown that this is the PROP for <b>special</b> bicommutative bimonoids, meaning those where comultiplication followed by multiplication is the identity:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="100" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_special_bimonoid.jpg" />
</div>
<p>But again, this follows from the general result of Wadsley and Woods!</p>
<p>Finally, taking the commutative ring of integers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{Z}," class="latex" /> Wadsley and Woods showed that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BMat%7D%28%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{Mat}(&#92;mathbb{Z})" class="latex" /> is the PROP for bicommutative Hopf monoids.  The key here is that scalar multiplication by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=-1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="-1" class="latex" /> obeys the axioms for an <b>antipode</b>&#8212;the extra morphism that makes a bimonoid into a <b>Hopf monoid</b>. Here are those axioms:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="250" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_antipode.jpg" />
</div>
<p>More generally, whenever <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="R" class="latex" /> is a commutative ring, the presence of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=-1+%5Cin+R&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="-1 &#92;in R" class="latex" /> guarantees that a bimonoid over <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="R" class="latex" /> is automatically a Hopf monoid over <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="R." class="latex" /> So, when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="R" class="latex" /> is a commutative ring, Wadsley and Woods&#8217; result implies that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BMat%7D%28R%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{Mat}(R)" class="latex" /> is the PROP for Hopf monoids over <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="R." class="latex" /></p>
<p>Earlier, in their paper on &#8216;interacting Hopf algebras&#8217;, Bonchi, Soboci&#324;ski and Zanasi had given an elegant and very different proof that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BMat%7D%28R%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{Mat}(R)" class="latex" /> is the PROP for Hopf monoids over <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="R" class="latex" /> whenever <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="R" class="latex" /> is a principal ideal domain.  The advantage of their argument is that they build up the PROP for Hopf monoids over <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="R" class="latex" /> from smaller pieces, using some ideas developed by Steve Lack.  But the new argument by Wadsley and Woods has its own charm.</p>
<p>In short, we&#8217;re getting the diagrammatics of linear algebra worked out very nicely, providing a solid mathematical foundation for signal flow diagrams in control theory!</p>

					<p><i>by <b><a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Brendan+Fong">Brendan Fong</a></b></i></p>
<p>Hugo Nava-Kopp and I have a new paper on resource theories:</p>
<p>&bull; Brendan Fong and Hugo Nava-Kopp, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.02651">Additive monotones for resource theories of parallel-combinable processes with discarding</a>.</p>
<p>A mathematical theory of resources is Tobias Fritz&#8217;s current big project. He&#8217;s already explained how ordered monoids can be viewed as theories of resource convertibility in a <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/04/07/resource-convertibility-part-1/">three part series</a> on this blog.</p>
<p>Ordered monoids are great, and quite familiar in network theory: for example, a Petri net can be viewed as a presentation for an ordered commutative monoid. But this work started in symmetric monoidal categories, together with my (Oxford) supervisor Bob Coecke and Rob Spekkens.</p>
<p>The main idea is this: think of the objects of your symmetric monoidal category as resources, and your morphisms as ways to convert one resource into another. The monoidal product or &#8216;tensor product&#8217; in your category allows you to talk about collections of your resources. So, for example, in the resource theory of chemical reactions, our objects are molecules like oxygen O<sub>2</sub>, hydrogen H<sub>2</sub>, and water H<sub>2</sub>O, and morphisms things like the electrolysis of water:</p>
<div align="center">
2H<sub>2</sub>O &rarr; O<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>
</div>
<p>This is a categorification of the ordered commutative monoid of resource convertibility: we now keep track of <i>how</i> we convert resources into one another, instead of just <i>whether</i> we can convert them.</p>
<p>Categorically, I find the other direction easier to state: being a category, the resource theory is enriched over <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BSet%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{Set}" class="latex" />, while a poset is enriched over the poset of truth values or &#8216;booleans&#8217; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BB%7D+%3D+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{B} = &#92;{0,1&#92;}." class="latex" />  If we &#8216;partially decategorify&#8217; by changing the base of enrichment along the functor <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BSet%7D+%5Cto+%5Cmathbb%7BB%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{Set} &#92;to &#92;mathbb{B}" class="latex" /> that maps the empty set to 0 and any nonempty set to 1, we obtain the ordered monoid corresponding to the resource theory.</p>
<p>But the research programme didn&#8217;t start at resource theories either. The starting point was &#8216;partitioned process theories&#8217;.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example that guided the definitions. Suppose we have a bunch of labs with interacting quantum systems, separated in space. With enough cooperation and funding, they can do big joint operations on their systems, like create entangled pairs between two locations. For &#8216;free&#8217;, however, they&#8217;re limited to classical communication between the locations, although they can do the full range of quantum operations on their local system. So you&#8217;ve got a symmetric monoidal category with objects quantum systems and morphisms quantum operations, together with a wide (all-object-including) symmetric monoidal subcategory that contains the morphisms you can do with local quantum operations and classical communication (known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOCC">LOCC</a> operations).</p>
<p>This general structure: a symmetric monoidal category (or <b>SMC</b> for short) with a wide symmetric monoidal subcategory, is called a <b>partitioned process theory</b>. We call the morphisms in the SMC <b>processes</b>, and those in the subSMC <b>free processes</b>.</p>
<p>There are a number of methods for building a resource theory (i.e. an SMC) from a partitioned process theory. The unifying idea though, is that your new SMC has the processes <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%2Cg&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f,g" class="latex" /> as objects, and morphisms <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f+%5Cto+g&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f &#92;to g" class="latex" /> ways of using the free processes to build <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="g" class="latex" /> from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f." class="latex" /></p>
<p>But we don&#8217;t have to go to fancy sounding quantum situations to find examples of partitioned process theories. Instead, just look at any SMC in which each object is equipped with an algebraic structure.  Then the morphisms defining this structure can be taken as our &#8216;free&#8217; processes.</p>
<p>For example, in a <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.5942">multigraph category</a> every object has the structure of a &#8216;special commutative Frobenius algebra&#8217;.  That&#8217;s a bit of a mouthful, but John defined it <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/04/23/categories-in-control-2/">a while back</a>, and examples include categories where morphisms are electrical circuits, and categories where morphisms are signal flow diagrams.</p>
<p>So these categories give partitioned process theories! This idea of partitioning the morphisms into &#8216;free&#8217; ones and &#8216;costly&#8217; ones is reminiscent of what I was saying <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/05/05/cospans-wiring-diagrams-and-the-behavioral-approach/">earlier</a> about the operad of wiring diagrams about it being useful to separate behavioural structure from interconnection structure.</p>
<p>This suggests that we can also view the free processes as generating some sort of operad, that describes the ways we allow ourselves to use free processes to turn processes into other processes. If we really want to roll a big machine out to play with this stuff, framed bicategories may also be interesting; Spivak is already using them to get at questions about operads. But that&#8217;s all conjecture, and a bit of a digression.</p>
<p>To get back to the point, this was all just to say that if you find yourself with a bunch of resistors, and you ask &#8216;what can I build?&#8217;, then you&#8217;re after the resource theory apparatus.</p>

			<div class="textwidget"><p>You can <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics">include math in your comments using LaTeX</a>,  but you need to do it this way:</p>
<p>&#036;latex  E = mc^2&#036;</p>
<p>You need the word 'latex' right after the first dollar sign, and it needs a space after it.  Double dollar signs don't work, and other limitations apply, some described <a href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/latex/">here</a>.  You can't preview comments here, but I'm happy to fix errors.</p>
