					<p><i>joint with <b><a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Brendan+Fong">Brendan Fong</a></b></i></p>
<p>We&#8217;re getting ready for the Turin workshop on the <a href=""><br />
</a><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/04/04/categorical-foundations-of-network-theory/">Categorical Foundations of Network Theory</a>.  So, we&#8217;re trying to get our thoughts in order.</p>
<p><a href>Last time</a> we talked about understanding types of networks as categories of decorated cospans.  <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/04/02/a-networked-world-part-3/">Earlier</a>, David Spivak told us about understanding networks as algebras of an operad.  Both these frameworks work at capturing notions of modularity and interconnection.  Are they then related?  How?</p>
<p>In this post we want to discuss some similarities between decorated cospan categories and algebras for <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.0297">Spivak&#8217;s operad of wiring diagrams</a>. The main idea is that the two approaches are &#8216;essentially&#8217; equivalent, but that compared to decorated cospans, Spivak&#8217;s operad formalism puts greater emphasis on the distinction between the &#8216;duplication&#8217; and &#8216;deletion&#8217; morphisms and other morphisms in our category.</p>
<p>The precise details are still to be worked out&#8212;jump in and help us!</p>
<h3> Operads </h3>
<p>We begin with a bit about operads in general. Recall that an operad is similar to a category, except that instead of a set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7Bhom%7D%28x%2Cy%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{hom}(x,y)" class="latex" /> of morphisms from any object <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> to any object <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y," class="latex" /> you have a set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7Bhom%7D%28x_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_n%3By%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{hom}(x_1,&#92;dots,x_n;y)" class="latex" /> of <b>operations</b> from any finite list of objects <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1%2C...%2Cx_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x_1,...,x_n" class="latex" /> to any object <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y+.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y ." class="latex" /> If we have an operation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f+%5Cin+%5Cmathrm%7Bhom%7D%28x_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_n%3By%29%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f &#92;in &#92;mathrm{hom}(x_1,&#92;dots,x_n;y)," class="latex" /> we can call <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+x_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x_1, &#92;dots, x_n" class="latex" /> the <b>inputs</b> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" /> and call <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y" class="latex" /> the <b>output</b> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f+.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f ." class="latex" /></p>
<p>We can compose operations in an operad.  To understand how, it&#8217;s easiest to use pictures.   We draw an operation in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7Bhom%7D%28x_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_n%3By%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{hom}(x_1,&#92;dots,x_n;y)" class="latex" /> as a little box with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" /> wires coming in and one wire coming out:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="100" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/operad/operation.jpg" />
</div>
<p>The input wires should be labelled with the objects <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+x_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x_1, &#92;dots, x_n" class="latex" /> and the output wire with the object <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y," class="latex" /> but I haven&#8217;t done this.</p>
<p>We are allowed to compose these operations as follows:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="250" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/operad/composition.jpg" />
</div>
<p>as long as the outputs of the operations <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cg_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="g_1,&#92;dots,g_n" class="latex" /> match the inputs of the operation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f+.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f ." class="latex" />   The result is a new operation which we call <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f+%5Ccirc+%28g_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cg_n%29+.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f &#92;circ (g_1,&#92;dots,g_n) ." class="latex" /></p>
<p>We demand that there be unary operations <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1_x+%5Cin+%5Cmathrm%7Bhom%7D%28x%3Bx%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="1_x &#92;in &#92;mathrm{hom}(x;x)" class="latex" /> serving as identities for composition, and we impose an <b>associative law</b> that makes a composite of composites like this well-defined:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="400" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/operad/associativity.jpg" />
</div>
<p>So far this is the definition of a operad without permutations.  In a full-fledged <b>permutative</b> operad, we can also permute the inputs of an operation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" /> and get a new operation:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="100" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/operad/permutation.jpg" />
</div>
<p>which we call <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f+%5Csigma&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f &#92;sigma" class="latex" /> if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csigma&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;sigma" class="latex" /> is the the permutation of the inputs.  We demand that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28f+%5Csigma%29+%5Csigma%27+%3D+f+%28%5Csigma+%5Csigma%27%29+.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(f &#92;sigma) &#92;sigma&#039; = f (&#92;sigma &#92;sigma&#039;) ." class="latex" />   And finally, we demand that permutations act in a way that is compatible with composition.  For example:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/operad/compatibility.jpg" />
</div>
<p>Here we see that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28f+%5Csigma%29+%5Ccirc+%28g_1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+g_n%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(f &#92;sigma) &#92;circ (g_1, &#92;dots, g_n)" class="latex" /> is equal to some obvious other thing.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a law saying</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f+%5Ccirc+%28g_1+%5Csigma_1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+g_n+%5Csigma_n%29+%3D+%28f+%5Ccirc+%28g_1+%2C+%5Cdots%2C+g_n%29%29+%5Csigma+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f &#92;circ (g_1 &#92;sigma_1, &#92;dots, g_n &#92;sigma_n) = (f &#92;circ (g_1 , &#92;dots, g_n)) &#92;sigma " class="latex" /></p>
<p>for some choice of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csigma&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;sigma" class="latex" /> that you can cook up from the permuations <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csigma_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;sigma_i" class="latex" /> in an obvious way.  We leave it as an exercise to work out the details.   By the way, <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Operads_in_Algebra_Topology_and_Physics.html?id=Rqh8ZgUEAmMC">one well-known book on operads</a> accidentally omits this law, so here&#8217;s a rather more lengthy exercise: read this book, see which theorems require this law, and correct their proofs!</p>
<p>Operads are similar to symmetric monoidal categories. The idea is that in a symmetric monoidal category you can just form the tensor product <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1+%5Cotimes+%5Cdots+%5Cotimes+x_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x_1 &#92;otimes &#92;dots &#92;otimes x_n" class="latex" /> and talk about the set of morphisms <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1+%5Cotimes+%5Ccdots+%5Cotimes+%5Ccdots+x_n+%5Cto+y+.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x_1 &#92;otimes &#92;cdots &#92;otimes &#92;cdots x_n &#92;to y ." class="latex" /> Indeed any symmetric monoidal category gives an operad in this way: just define <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7Bhom%7D%28x_1%2C...%2Cx_n%3By%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{hom}(x_1,...,x_n;y)" class="latex" /> to be <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7Bhom%7D%28x_1+%5Cotimes+%5Ccdots+%5Cotimes+x_n%2C+y%29+.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{hom}(x_1 &#92;otimes &#92;cdots &#92;otimes x_n, y) ." class="latex" />  If we do this with Set, which is a symmetric monoidal category using the usual cartesian product of sets, we get an operad called <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BSet%7D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{Set}." class="latex" /></p>
<p>An <b>algebra</b> for an operad <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O" class="latex" /> is an operad homomorphism <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O+%5Cto+%5Cmathrm%7BSet%7D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O &#92;to &#92;mathrm{Set}." class="latex" />  We haven&#8217;t said what an operad homomorphism is, but you can probably figure it out yourself.  The point is this: an algebra for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O" class="latex" /> turns the abstract operations in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O" class="latex" /> into actual operations on sets!</p>
<p>Finally, we should warn you that operads come in several flavors, and we&#8217;ve been talking about &#8216;typed permutative operads&#8217;.  &#8216;Typed&#8217; means that there&#8217;s more than one object; &#8216;permutative&#8217; means that we have the ability to permute the input wires.  When people say &#8216;operad&#8217;, they often mean an <i>untyped</i> permutative operad.  For that, just specialize down to the case where there&#8217;s only one object <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x." class="latex" /></p>
<p>You can see a fully precise definition of untyped permutative operads here:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operad_theory">Operad theory</a>, Wikipedia.</p>
<p>along with the definition of an untyped operad without permutations.</p>
<h3>The operad of wiring diagrams</h3>
<p>Spivak&#8217;s favorite operad is the operad of wiring diagrams.  The operad of wiring diagrams <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=WD&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="WD" class="latex" /> is an operad version of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BCospan%7D%28%5Cmathrm%7BFinSet%7D%29%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{Cospan}(&#92;mathrm{FinSet})," class="latex" /> constructed in the vein suggested above: the objects are finite sets, and an operation from a list of sets <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X_1%2C...%2CX_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X_1,...,X_n" class="latex" /> to a set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Y" class="latex" /> is a cospan</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X_1%2B+%5Ccdots+%2BX_n+%5Crightarrow+S+%5Cleftarrow+Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X_1+ &#92;cdots +X_n &#92;rightarrow S &#92;leftarrow Y" class="latex" /></p>
<p>Spivak draws such a thing as a big circle with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" /> small circles cut out from the interior:</p>
<p><img width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/decorated_cospans/wiring_diagram.jpg" /></p>
<p>The outside of the big circle has a set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Y" class="latex" /> of terminals marked on it, and each small circle has a set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X_i" class="latex" /> of terminals marked on it. Then in the interior of this shape there are wires connecting these terminals.  This what he calls a <b>wiring diagrams</b>.</p>
<p>You compose these wiring diagrams by pasting other wiring diagrams into each of the small circles.</p>
<p>The relationship with our Frobenius monoid diagrams is pretty simple: we draw our &#8216;wiring diagrams&#8217; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X+%5Cto+Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X &#92;to Y" class="latex" /> in a square, with the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> terminals on the left and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Y" class="latex" /> terminals on the right. To get a Spivak-approved wiring diagram, glue the top and bottom edges of this square together, then flatten the cylinder you get down into an annulus, with the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" />-side on the inside and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Y" class="latex" />-side on the outside. If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X+%3D+X_1%2BX_2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X = X_1+X_2" class="latex" /> you can imagine gluing opposite edges of the inside circle together to divide it into two small circles accordingly, and so on.</p>
<h3>Relational algebras of type <i>A</i></h3>
<p>Algebras for wiring diagrams tell you what components you have available to wire together with your diagrams. An algebra for the operad of wiring diagrams is an operad homomorphism</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=WD+%5Cto+%5Cmathrm%7BSet%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="WD &#92;to &#92;mathrm{Set}" class="latex" /></p>
<p>What does this look like? Just like a functor for categories, it assigns to each natural number a set, and each wiring diagram a function.</p>
<p>In work related to decorated cospans (such as <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/04/28/a-compositional-framework-for-passive-linear-networks/">our paper on circuits</a> or <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.6881">John and Jason&#8217;s work on signal flow diagrams</a>), our semantics usually is constructed from a field of values&#8212;not a physicist&#8217;s &#8216;field&#8217;, bt an algebraist&#8217;s sort of &#8216;field&#8217;, where you can add, multiply, subtract and divide.   For example, we like being able to assign a real number like a velocity, or potential, or current to a variable.  This gives us vector spaces and a bunch of nice linear-algebraic structures.</p>
<p>Spivak works more generally: he&#8217;s interested in the structure when you just have a set of values. While this means we can&#8217;t do some of the nice things we could do with a field, it also means this framework can do things like talk about logic gates, where the variables are boolean ones, or number theoretic questions, where you&#8217;re interested in the natural numbers.</p>
<p>So to discuss semantics we pick a set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> of values, such as the real numbers or natural numbers or booleans or colors. We imagine then associating elements of this set to each wire in a wiring diagram. More technically, the algebra</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BRel%7DA%3A+WD+%5Cto+%5Cmathrm%7BSet%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{Rel}A: WD &#92;to &#92;mathrm{Set}" class="latex" /></p>
<p>then maps each finite set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> to the power set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BP%7D%28A%5EX%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathcal{P}(A^X)" class="latex" /> of the set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%5EX&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A^X" class="latex" /> of functions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X+%5Cto+A+.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X &#92;to A ." class="latex" /></p>
<p>On the morphisms (the wiring diagrams themselves), this functor behaves as follows.  Note that a function (<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X+%5Cto+A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X &#92;to A" class="latex" />) can be thought of as an &#8216;<i>X</i>-vector&#8217; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28a_1%2C...%2Ca_x%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(a_1,...,a_x)" class="latex" /> of &#8216;<i>A</i>-coordinates&#8217;. A wiring diagram <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X+%5Cto+Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X &#92;to Y" class="latex" /> is just a cospan</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X+%5Cto+N++%5Cleftarrow+Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X &#92;to N  &#92;leftarrow Y" class="latex" /></p>
<p>in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BFinSet%7D%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{FinSet}," class="latex" /> so it can be thought of as some compares</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X+%5Cto+N&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X &#92;to N" class="latex" /></p>
<p>followed by some copies</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N+%5Cto+Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="N &#92;to Y" class="latex" /></p>
<p>Thus, given a wiring diagram <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X+%5Cto+Y%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X &#92;to Y," class="latex" /> we can consider a partial function that maps an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" />-vector to the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Y" class="latex" />-vector by doing these compares, and if it passes them does the copies and returns the resulting <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Y" class="latex" />-vector, but if not returns &#8216;undefined&#8217;. We can then define a map <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BP%7D%28A%5EX%29+%5Cto+%5Cmathcal%7BP%7D%28A%5EY%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathcal{P}(A^X) &#92;to &#92;mathcal{P}(A^Y)" class="latex" /> which takes a set of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" />-vectors to its image under this partial function.</p>
<p>This semantics is called the <b>relational <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=WD&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="WD" class="latex" />-algebra of type</b> <i>A</i>.  We can think of it as being like the &#8216;light operations&#8217; fragment of the signal flow calculus.  By &#8216;light operations&#8217;, we mean the operations of duplication and deletion, which form a cocommutative comonoid:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_cocommutative_comonoid.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p>and their time-reversed versions, &#8216;coduplication&#8217; and &#8216;codeletion&#8217;, which form a commutatative monoid:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_commutative_monoid_dual.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p>These fit together to form a <b>Frobenius monoid</b>, meaning that these equations hold:</p>

<img width="250" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_frobenius_duplication.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p>And it&#8217;s actually <b>extra-special</b>, meaning that these equations hold:</p>

<p>Note that we can&#8217;t do the &#8216;dark operations&#8217;, because we only have a set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> of values, not a field, and the dark operations involve addition and zero!</p>
<h3>Operads and the behavioral approach</h3>
<p>In formulating Frobenius monoids this way, Spivak achieves something that we&#8217;ve been working hard to find ways to achieve: a separation of the behavioral structure from the interconnection structure.</p>
<p>What do I mean by this? In his &#8216;<a href="http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~jwillems/Articles/JournalArticles/2007.1.pdf">behavioral approach</a>&#8216;, Willems makes the point that for all their elaborate and elegant formulation, in the end physical laws just come down to dividing the set of what might a priori be possible (the &#8216;universum&#8217;) into the set of things that actually are possible (the &#8216;behavior&#8217;), and the set of things that aren&#8217;t). Here the universum is the set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%5EX&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A^X" class="latex" />: a priori, on each of the wires in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X," class="latex" /> we might associate any value of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A ." class="latex" /> For example, to the two wires at the ends of a resistor, we might a priori associate any pair of currents. But physical law, here Kirchhoff&#8217;s current law, says otherwise: the currents must be equal and opposite. So the &#8216;behavior&#8217; is the subset <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28i%2C-i%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(i,-i)" class="latex" /> of the universum <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E2.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}^2." class="latex" /></p>
<p>So you can say that to each object <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> in the operad of wiring diagrams the relational algebra of type <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> associates the set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BP%7D%28A%5EX%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathcal{P}(A^X)" class="latex" /> of possible behaviors&#8212;the universum is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%5EX+.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A^X ." class="latex" /> (<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BP%7D%28A%5EX%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathcal{P}(A^X)" class="latex" /> forms some sort of meta-universum, where you can discuss physical laws about physical laws, commonly called &#8216;principles&#8217;.)</p>
<p>The second key aspect of the behavioral approach is that the behaviors of larger systems can be constructed from the behaviors of its subsystems, if we understand the so-called &#8216;interconnection structure&#8217; well enough. This is a key principle in engineering: we build big, complicated systems from a much smaller set of components, whether it be electronics from resistors and inductors, or mechanical devices from wheels and rods and ropes, or houses from Lego bricks. The various interconnection structures here are the wiring diagrams, and our relational algebras say they act by what Willems calls &#8216;variable sharing&#8217;.</p>
<p>This division between behavior and interconnection motivates the decorated cospan construction (where the decorations are the &#8216;components&#8217;, the cospans the &#8216;interconnection&#8217;) and also the multigraph categories discussed by Aleks Kissinger (where morphisms are the &#8216;components&#8217;, and the Frobenius monoid operations are the &#8216;interconnection&#8217;):</p>
<p>&bull; Aleks Kissinger, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.5942">Finite matrices are complete for (dagger-)multigraph categories</a>.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s good to have this additional way of thinking about things in our repertoire: operads describe &#8216;interconnection&#8217;, their algebras &#8216;behaviors&#8217;.</p>
<p>The separation Spivak achieves, however, seems to me to come at the cost of neat ways to talk about individual components, and perhaps this can be seen as the essential difference between the two approaches. By including our components as morphisms, we can talk more carefully about them and additional structure individual components have. On the other hand, by lumping all the components into the objects, Spivak can talk more carefully about how the interconnection structure acts on all behaviors at once.</p>
<h3>Other operads of wiring diagrams</h3>
<p>One advantage of the operad approach is that you can easily tweak your operad to talk about different sorts of network structure. Sometimes you can make similar adjustments with decorated cospans too, such as working over the category of typed finite sets, rather than just finite sets, to discuss networks in which wires have types, and only wires of the same types can be connected together. A physical example is a model of a hydroelectric power plant, where you don&#8217;t want to connect a water pipe with an electrical cable! This is also a common technique in computer science, where you don&#8217;t want to try to multiply two strings of text, or try to interpret a telephone number as a truth value.</p>
<p>But some modifications are harder to do with decorated cospans. In some other papers, Spivak employs a more restricted operad of wiring diagrams, in which joining wires and terminating wires is not allowed, among other things. He uses this to formalise graphical languages for certain types of <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.6894">discrete-time processes</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.1598">open dynamical systems</a>, including <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.07380">mode-dependent ones</a>.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/04/28/a-compositional-framework-for-passive-linear-networks/">Last time</a> I talked about a new paper I wrote with <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/brendan.fong/">Brendan Fong</a>.  It&#8217;s about electrical circuits made of &#8216;passive&#8217; components, like resistors, inductors and capacitors.  We showed these circuits are morphisms in a category.  Moreover, there&#8217;s a functor sending each circuit to its &#8216;external behavior&#8217;: what it <em>does</em>, as seen by someone who can only measure voltages and currents at the terminals.</p>
<p>Our paper uses a formalism that Brendan developed here:</p>
<p>• Brendan Fong, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.00872">Decorated cospans</a>, <i><a href="http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/30/33/30-33abs.htm\
l">Theory and Applications of Categories</a></i> <b>30</b> (2015), 1096–1120.</p>
<p>The idea here is we may want to take something like a graph with edges labelled by positive numbers:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/decorated_cospans/labelled_graph.jpg" /></div>
<p>and say that some of its nodes are &#8216;inputs&#8217;, while others are &#8216;outputs&#8217;:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/decorated_cospans/labelled_graph_as_cospan_1.jpg" width="90%" height="90%" /></div>
<p>This lets us treat our labelled graph as a &#8216;morphism&#8217; from the set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> to the set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Y." class="latex" /></p>
<p>The point is that we can <i>compose</i> such morphisms.  For example, suppose we have another one of these things, going from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Y" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Z" class="latex" />:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/decorated_cospans/labelled_graph_as_cospan_2.jpg" width="90%" height="90%" /></div>
<p>Since the points of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Y" class="latex" /> are sitting in both things:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/decorated_cospans/labelled_graphs_as_composable_cospans.jpg" width="90%" height="90%" /></div>
<p>we can glue them together and get a thing going from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Z" class="latex" />:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/decorated_cospans/labelled_graph_as_composite_cospan.jpg" width="90%" height="90%" /></div>
<p>That&#8217;s how we compose these morphisms.</p>
<p>Note how we&#8217;re specifying some nodes of our original thing as inputs and outputs:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/decorated_cospans/labelled_graph_as_cospan_1.jpg" width="90%" height="90%" /></div>
<p>We&#8217;re using maps from two sets <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Y" class="latex" /> to the set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="N" class="latex" /> of nodes of our graph.  And a bit surprisingly, we&#8217;re not demanding that these maps be one-to-one.  That turns out to be useful&#8212;and in general, when doing math, it&#8217;s dumb to make your definitions forbid certain possibilities unless you really need to.</p>
<p>So, our thing is really a <b>cospan</b> of finite sets&#8212;that is, a diagram of finite sets and functions like this:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/decorated_cospans/cospan.jpg" width="200" /></div>
<p>together some extra structure on the set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="N." class="latex" />  This extra structure is what Brendan calls a <b>decoration</b>, and it makes the cospan into a &#8216;decorated cospan&#8217;.  In this particular example, a decoration on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="N" class="latex" /> is a way of making it into the nodes of a graph with edges labelled by positive numbers.  But one could consider many other kinds of decorations: this idea is very general.</p>
<p>To formalize the idea of &#8216;a kind of decoration&#8217;, Brendan uses a functor</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%3A+%5Cmathrm%7BFinSet%7D+%5Cto+%5Cmathrm%7BSet%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F: &#92;mathrm{FinSet} &#92;to &#92;mathrm{Set} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>sending each finite set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="N" class="latex" /> to a set of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%28N%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F(N)." class="latex" />  This set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%28N%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F(N)" class="latex" /> is the set of decorations of the given kind that we can put on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="N." class="latex" /></p>
<p>So, for any such functor <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F," class="latex" /> a <b>decorated cospan of finite sets</b> is a cospan of finite sets:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/decorated_cospans/cospan.jpg" width="200" /></div>
<p>together with an element of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%28N%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F(N)." class="latex" /></p>
<p>But in fact, Brendan goes further.  He&#8217;s not content to use a functor</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%3A+%5Cmathrm%7BFinSet%7D+%5Cto+%5Cmathrm%7BSet%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F: &#92;mathrm{FinSet} &#92;to &#92;mathrm{Set} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>to decorate his cospans.</p>
<p>First, there&#8217;s no need to limit ourselves to cospans of <i>finite sets</i>: we can replace <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BFinSet%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{FinSet}" class="latex" /> with some other category!  If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C" class="latex" /> is any category with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Limit_%28category_theory%29&amp;redirect=no#Colimits">finite colimits</a>, there&#8217;s a category <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BCospan%7D%28C%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{Cospan}(C)" class="latex" /> with:</p>
<p>• objects of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C" class="latex" /> as its objects,<br />
• isomorphism classes of cospans between these as morphisms.</p>
<p>Second, there&#8217;s no need to limit ourselves to decorations that are elements of a <i>set</i>: we can replace <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BSet%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{Set}" class="latex" /> with some other category!  If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="D" class="latex" /> is any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_monoidal_category">symmetric monoidal category</a>, we can define an <b>element</b> of an object <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d+%5Cin+D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="d &#92;in D" class="latex" /> to be a morphism</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%3A+I+%5Cto+d&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f: I &#92;to d" class="latex" /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="I" class="latex" /> is the unit for the tensor product in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="D." class="latex" /></p>
<p>So, Brendan defines decorated cospans at this high level of generality, and shows that under some mild conditions we can compose them, just as in the pictures we saw earlier.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s one of the theorems Brendan proves:</p>
<p><b>Theorem.</b>  Suppose <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C" class="latex" /> is a category with finite colimits, and make <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C" class="latex" /> into a symmetric monoidal category with its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coproduct">coproduct</a> as the tensor product.  Suppose <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="D" class="latex" /> is a symmetric monoidal category, and suppose <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%3A+C+%5Cto+D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F: C &#92;to D" class="latex" /> is a <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/symmetric+monoidal+functor">lax symmetric monoidal functor</a>. Define an <b><i>F</i>-decorated cospan</b> to be a cospan</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/decorated_cospans/cospan.jpg" width="200" /></div>
<p>in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C" class="latex" /> together with an element of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%28N%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F(N)." class="latex" />   Then there is a category with</p>
<p>• objects of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C" class="latex" /> as its objects,<br />
• isomorphism classes of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F" class="latex" />-decorated cospans as its morphisms.</p>
<p>This is called the <b><i>F</i>-decorated cospan category</b>, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=FCospan.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="FCospan." class="latex" />  This category becomes symmetric monoidal in a natural way.  It is then a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagger_compact_category">dagger compact category</a>.</p>
<p>(You may not know all this jargon, but &#8216;lax symmetric monoidal&#8217;, for example, talks about how we can take decorations on two things and get a decoration on their disjoint union, or &#8216;coproduct&#8217;.  We need to be able to do this&#8212;as should be obvious from the pictures I drew.  Also, a &#8216;dagger compact category&#8217; is the kind of category whose morphisms can be drawn as networks.)</p>
<p>Brendan also explains how to get functors between decorated cospan categories.  We need this in our paper on electrical circuits, because we consider several categories where morphisms is a circuit, or something that captures some aspect of a circuit.  Most of these categories are decorated cospan categories.  We want to get functors between them.  And often we can just use Brendan&#8217;s general results to get the job done!  No fuss, no muss: all the hard work has been done ahead of time.</p>
<p>I expect to use this technology a lot in my work on network theory.</p>

				<small>28 April, 2015</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>Here&#8217;s a new paper on network theory:</p>
<p>• John Baez and Brendan Fong, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.05625">A compositional framework for passive linear networks</a>, <i><a href="http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/33/38/33-38abs.html">Theory and Applications of Categories</a></i> <b>33</b> (2018), 1158–1222.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/04/23/categories-in-control-2/"> my paper with Jason Erbele</a> studies <i>signal flow diagrams</i>, this one focuses on <i>circuit diagrams</i>.  The two are different, but closely related.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll explain their relation at the <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/04/04/categorical-foundations-of-network-theory/">Turin workshop</a> in May.  For now, let me just talk about this paper with Brendan.  There&#8217;s a lot in here, but let me just try to explain the main result.  It&#8217;s all about &#8216;black boxing&#8217;: hiding the details of a circuit and only remembering its behavior as seen from outside.</p>
<h3> The idea</h3>
<p>In late 1940s, just as Feynman was developing his diagrams for processes in particle physics, Eilenberg and Mac Lane initiated their work on category theory.  Over the subsequent decades, and especially in the work of Joyal and Street in the 1980s, it became clear that these developments were profoundly linked: monoidal categories have a precise graphical representation in terms of string diagrams, and conversely monoidal categories provide an algebraic foundation for the intuitions behind Feynman diagrams.  The key insight is the use of categories where morphisms describe physical processes, rather than structure-preserving maps between mathematical objects.</p>
<p>In work on fundamental physics, the cutting edge has moved from categories to higher categories.  But the same techniques have filtered into more immediate applications, particularly in computation and quantum computation.   Our paper is part of a new program of applying string diagrams to engineering, with the aim of giving diverse diagram languages a unified foundation based on category theory.</p>
<p>Indeed, even before physicists began using Feynman diagrams, various branches of engineering were using diagrams that in retrospect are closely related.   Foremost among these are the ubiquitous electrical circuit diagrams. Although less well-known, similar diagrams are used to describe networks consisting of mechanical, hydraulic, thermodynamic and chemical systems.   Further work, pioneered in particular by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Wright_Forrester">Forrester</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_T._Odum">Odum</a>, applies similar diagrammatic methods to biology, ecology, and economics.</p>
<p>As discussed in detail by <a href="https://archive.org/details/DynamicalAnalogies">Olsen</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Paynter">Paynter</a> and others, there are mathematically precise analogies between these different systems.  In each case, the system&#8217;s state is described by variables that come in pairs, with one variable in each pair playing the role of  &#8216;displacement&#8217; and the other playing the role of &#8216;momentum&#8217;.  In engineering, the time derivatives of these variables are sometimes called &#8216;flow&#8217; and &#8216;effort&#8217;.</p>

<p>In classical mechanics, this pairing of variables is well understood using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_geometry">symplectic geometry</a>.  Thus, any mathematical formulation of the diagrams used to describe networks in engineering needs to take symplectic geometry as well as category theory into account.</p>
<p>While diagrams of networks have been independently introduced in many disciplines, we do not expect formalizing these diagrams to immediately help the practitioners of these disciplines.  At first the flow of information will mainly go in the other direction: by translating ideas from these disciplines into the language of modern mathematics, we can provide mathematicians with food for thought and interesting new problems to solve.  We hope that in the long run mathematicians can return the favor by bringing new insights to the table.</p>
<p>Although we keep the broad applicability of network diagrams in the back of our minds, our paper talks in terms of electrical circuits, for the sake of familiarity.  We also consider a somewhat limited class of circuits.  We only study circuits built from &#8216;passive&#8217; components: that is, those that do not produce energy.  Thus, we exclude batteries and current sources.  We only consider components that respond linearly to an applied voltage.   Thus, we exclude components such as nonlinear resistors or diodes.  Finally, we only consider components with one input and one output, so that a circuit can be described as a graph with edges labeled by components.  Thus, we also exclude transformers.  The most familiar components our framework covers are linear resistors, capacitors and inductors.</p>
<p>While we want to expand our scope in future work, the class of circuits made from these components has appealing mathematical properties, and is worthy of deep study.  Indeed, these circuits has been studied intensively for many decades by electrical engineers.  Even circuits made exclusively of resistors have inspired work by mathematicians of the caliber of <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/weyl1923.pdf">Weyl</a> and <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.jdg/1214430827">Smale</a>!</p>
<p>Our work relies on this research.  All we are adding is an emphasis on symplectic geometry and an explicitly &#8216;compositional&#8217; framework, which clarifies the way a larger circuit can be built from smaller pieces.  This is where monoidal categories become important: the main operations for building circuits from pieces are composition and tensoring.</p>
<p>Our strategy is most easily illustrated for circuits made of linear resistors.  Such a resistor dissipates power, turning useful energy into heat at a rate determined by the voltage across the resistor.  However, a remarkable fact is that a circuit made of these resistors always acts to <i>minimize</i> the power dissipated this way.  This &#8216;principle of minimum power&#8217; can be seen as the reason symplectic geometry becomes important in understanding circuits made of resistors, just as the principle of least action leads to the role of symplectic geometry in classical mechanics.</p>
<p>Here is a circuit made of linear resistors:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/circuits/circuit.jpg" width="450" /></div>
<p>The wiggly lines are resistors, and their resistances are written beside them: for example, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3%5COmega&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="3&#92;Omega" class="latex" /> means 3 ohms, an &#8216;ohm&#8217; being a unit of resistance.  To formalize this, define a circuit of linear resistors to consist of:</p>
<p>• a set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="N" class="latex" /> of <b>nodes</b>,<br />
• a set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="E" class="latex" /> of <b>edges</b>,<br />
• maps <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s%2Ct+%3A+E+%5Cto+N&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="s,t : E &#92;to N" class="latex" /> sending each edge to its <b>source</b> and <b>target</b> node,<br />
• a map <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%3A+E+%5Cto+%280%2C%5Cinfty%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r: E &#92;to (0,&#92;infty)" class="latex" /> specifying the <b>resistance</b> of the resistor<br />
labelling each edge,<br />
• maps <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i+%3A+X+%5Cto+N%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i : X &#92;to N," class="latex" /> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=o+%3A+Y+%5Cto+N&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="o : Y &#92;to N" class="latex" /> specifying the <b>inputs</b> and outputs of the circuit.</p>
<p>When we run electric current through such a circuit, each node <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%5Cin+N&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n &#92;in N" class="latex" /> gets a <b>potential</b> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi%28n%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;phi(n)." class="latex" />  The <b>voltage</b> across an edge <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e+%5Cin+E&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="e &#92;in E" class="latex" /> is defined as the change in potential as we move from to the source of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="e" class="latex" /> to its target, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi%28t%28e%29%29+-+%5Cphi%28s%28e%29%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;phi(t(e)) - &#92;phi(s(e))." class="latex" />  The <b>power</b> dissipated by the resistor on this edge is then</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Br%28e%29%7D%5Cbig%28%5Cphi%28t%28e%29%29-%5Cphi%28s%28e%29%29%5Cbig%29%5E2+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{1}{r(e)}&#92;big(&#92;phi(t(e))-&#92;phi(s(e))&#92;big)^2 }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>The total power dissipated by the circuit is therefore twice</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+P%28%5Cphi%29+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Csum_%7Be+%5Cin+E%7D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Br%28e%29%7D%5Cbig%28%5Cphi%28t%28e%29%29-%5Cphi%28s%28e%29%29%5Cbig%29%5E2+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ P(&#92;phi) = &#92;frac{1}{2}&#92;sum_{e &#92;in E} &#92;frac{1}{r(e)}&#92;big(&#92;phi(t(e))-&#92;phi(s(e))&#92;big)^2 }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>The factor of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;frac{1}{2}" class="latex" /> is convenient in some later calculations.</p>
<p>Note that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="P" class="latex" /> is a nonnegative quadratic form on the vector space <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5EN.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}^N." class="latex" />  However, not every nonnegative definite quadratic form on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5EN&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}^N" class="latex" /> arises in this way from some circuit of linear resistors with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="N" class="latex" /> as its set of nodes.  The quadratic forms that do arise are called <b>Dirichlet forms</b>.  They have been extensively investigated, and they play a major role in our work.</p>
<p>We write</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpartial+N+%3D+i%28X%29+%5Ccup+o%28Y%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;partial N = i(X) &#92;cup o(Y)" class="latex" /></p>
<p>for the set of <b>terminals</b>: that is, nodes corresponding to inputs or outputs.  The principle of minimum power says that if we fix the potential at the terminals, the circuit will choose the potential at other nodes to minimize the total power dissipated.    An element <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpsi&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;psi" class="latex" /> of the vector space <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E%7B%5Cpartial+N%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}^{&#92;partial N}" class="latex" /> assigns a potential to each terminal.   Thus, if we fix <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpsi%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;psi," class="latex" /> the total power dissipated will be twice</p>

<p>The function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q+%3A+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E%7B%5Cpartial+N%7D+%5Cto+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Q : &#92;mathbb{R}^{&#92;partial N} &#92;to &#92;mathbb{R}" class="latex" /> is again a Dirichlet form.  We call it the <b>power functional</b> of the circuit.</p>
<p>Now, suppose we are unable to see the internal workings of a circuit, and can only observe its &#8216;external behavior&#8217;: that is, the potentials at its terminals and the currents flowing into or out of these terminals.   Remarkably, this behavior is completely determined by the power functional <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Q." class="latex" />  The reason is that the current at any terminal can be obtained by differentiating <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Q" class="latex" /> with respect to the potential at this terminal, and relations of this form are <i>all</i> the relations that hold between potentials and currents at the terminals.</p>
<p>The Laplace transform allows us to generalize this immediately to circuits that can also contain linear inductors and capacitors, simply by changing the field we work over, replacing <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}" class="latex" /> by the field <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%28s%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}(s)" class="latex" /> of rational functions of a single real variable, and talking of <b>impedance</b> where we previously talked of resistance.  We obtain a category <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BCirc%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{Circ}" class="latex" /> where an object is a finite set, a morphism <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f+%3A+X+%5Cto+Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f : X &#92;to Y" class="latex" /> is a circuit with input set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> and output set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Y," class="latex" /> and composition is given by identifying the outputs of one circuit with the inputs of the next, and taking the resulting union of labelled graphs.  Each such circuit gives rise to a Dirichlet form, now defined over <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%28s%29%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}(s)," class="latex" /> and this Dirichlet form completely describes the externally observable behavior of the circuit.</p>
<p>We can take equivalence classes of circuits, where two circuits count as the same if they have the same Dirichlet form.  We wish for these equivalence classes of circuits to form a category. Although there is a notion of composition for Dirichlet forms, we find that it lacks identity morphisms or, equivalently, it lacks morphisms representing ideal wires of zero impedance. To address this we turn to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_vector_space#Subspaces">Lagrangian subspaces</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_vector_space">symplectic vector spaces</a>.

<p>This construction is well-known in classical mechanics, where the principle of least action plays a role analogous to that of the principle of minimum power here.   The set of Lagrangian subspaces is actually an algebraic variety, the <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_Grassmannian">Lagrangian Grassmannian</a></b>, which serves as a compactification of the space of quadratic forms.  The Lagrangian Grassmannian has already played a role in <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0304015">Sabot&#8217;s work</a> on circuits made of resistors. For us, its importance it that we can find identity morphisms for the composition of Dirichlet forms by taking circuits made of parallel resistors and letting their resistances tend to zero: the limit is not a Dirichlet form, but it exists in the Lagrangian Grassmannian.</p>
<p>Indeed, there exists a category <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BLagrRel%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{LagrRel}" class="latex" /> with finite dimensional symplectic vector spaces as objects and <b>Lagrangian relations</b> as morphisms: that is, linear relations from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="V" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="W" class="latex" /> that are given by Lagrangian subspaces of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BV%7D+%5Coplus+W%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;overline{V} &#92;oplus W," class="latex" /> where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BV%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;overline{V}" class="latex" /> is the symplectic vector space <b>conjugate</b> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="V" class="latex" />&#8212;that is, with the sign of the symplectic structure switched.</p>
<p>To move from the Lagrangian subspace defined by the graph of the differential of the power functional to a morphism in the category <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BLagrRel%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{LagrRel}" class="latex" />&#8212;that is, to a Lagrangian relation&#8212; we must treat seriously the input and output functions of the circuit. These express the circuit as built upon a <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/cospan">cospan</a>:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/circuits/cospan.jpg" /></div>
<p>Applicable far more broadly than this present formalization of circuits, cospans model systems with two &#8216;ends&#8217;, an input and output end, albeit without any connotation of directionality: we might just as well exchange the role of the inputs and outputs by taking the mirror image of the above diagram. The role of the input and output functions, as we have discussed, is to mark the terminals we may glue onto the terminals of another circuit, and the pushout of cospans gives formal precision to this gluing construction.</p>
<p>One upshot of this cospan framework is that we may consider circuits with elements of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="N" class="latex" /> that are both inputs and outputs, such as this one:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/circuits/identity_circuit.jpg" /></div>
<p>This corresponds to the identity morphism on the finite set with two elements. Another is that some points may be considered an input or output multiple times, like here:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/circuits/degenerate_circuit.jpg" /></div>
<p>This lets to connect two distinct outputs to the above double input.</p>

More precisely, for any given potential-current pair <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5Cpsi%2C%5Ciota%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(&#92;psi,&#92;iota)" class="latex" /> in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BF%7D%5EB+%5Coplus+%7B%28%5Cmathbb%7BF%7D%5EB%29%7D%5E%5Cast%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{F}^B &#92;oplus {(&#92;mathbb{F}^B)}^&#92;ast," class="latex" /> its image under <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Sf&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Sf" class="latex" /> consists of all elements of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5Cpsi%27%2C+%5Ciota%27%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(&#92;psi&#039;, &#92;iota&#039;)" class="latex" /> in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BF%7D%5EA+%5Coplus+%7B%28%5Cmathbb%7BF%7D%5EA%29%7D%5E%5Cast&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{F}^A &#92;oplus {(&#92;mathbb{F}^A)}^&#92;ast" class="latex" />  such that the potential at <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a+%5Cin+A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a &#92;in A" class="latex" /> is equal to the potential at <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28a%29+%5Cin+B%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f(a) &#92;in B," class="latex" /> and such that, for each fixed <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b+%5Cin+B%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="b &#92;in B," class="latex" /> collectively the currents at the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a+%5Cin+f%5E%7B-1%7D%28b%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a &#92;in f^{-1}(b)" class="latex" /> sum to the current at <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="b." class="latex" />  We use the symplectification <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=So&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="So" class="latex" /> of the output function to relate the state on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpartial+N&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;partial N" class="latex" /> to that on the outputs <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Y." class="latex" /></p>
<p>As our current framework is set up to report the current <i>out</i> of each node, to describe input currents we define the <b>twisted symplectification</b>:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%5Etf%3A+%5Cmathbb%7BF%7D%5EB+%5Coplus+%7B%28%5Cmathbb%7BF%7D%5EB%29%7D%5E%5Cast+%5Cto+%5Coverline%7B%5Cmathbb%7BF%7D%5EA+%5Coplus+%7B%28%5Cmathbb%7BF%7D%5EA%29%7D%5E%5Cast%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S^tf: &#92;mathbb{F}^B &#92;oplus {(&#92;mathbb{F}^B)}^&#92;ast &#92;to &#92;overline{&#92;mathbb{F}^A &#92;oplus {(&#92;mathbb{F}^A)}^&#92;ast}" class="latex" /></p>
<p>almost identically to the above, except that we flip the sign of the currents <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ciota%27+%5Cin+%28%5Cmathbb%7BF%7D%5EA%29%5E%5Cast.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;iota&#039; &#92;in (&#92;mathbb{F}^A)^&#92;ast." class="latex" />  This again gives a Lagrangian relation. We use the twisted symplectification <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%5Eti&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S^ti" class="latex" /> of the input function to relate the state on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpartial+N&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;partial N" class="latex" /> to that on the inputs.</p>
<p>The Lagrangian relation corresponding to a circuit then comprises exactly a list of the potential-current pairs that are possible electrical states of the inputs and outputs of the circuit. In doing so, it identifies distinct circuits.  A simple example of this is the identification of a single 2-ohm resistor:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/circuits/one-resistor_circuit.jpg" width="350" /></div>
<p>with two 1-ohm resistors in series:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/circuits/two-resistor_circuit.jpg" width="450" /></div>
<p>Our inability to access the internal workings of a circuit in this representation inspires us to call this process <b>black boxing</b>: you should imagine encasing the circuit in an opaque black box, leaving only the terminals accessible. Fortunately, this information is enough to completely characterize the external behavior of a circuit, including how it interacts when connected with other circuits!</p>
<p>Put more precisely, the black boxing process is <i>functorial</i>: we can  compute the black-boxed version of a circuit made of parts by computing the black-boxed versions of the parts and then composing them.   In fact we shall  prove that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BCirc%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{Circ}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BLagrRel%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{LagrRel}" class="latex" /> are dagger compact categories, and the black box functor preserves all this extra structure:</p>
<p><b>Theorem.</b> There exists a symmetric monoidal dagger functor, the <b>black box functor</b></p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cblacksquare%3A+%5Cmathrm%7BCirc%7D+%5Cto+%5Cmathrm%7BLagrRel%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;blacksquare: &#92;mathrm{Circ} &#92;to &#92;mathrm{LagrRel}" class="latex" /></p>

<p>The goal of this paper is to prove and explain this result.  The proof is more tricky than one might first expect, but our approach involves concepts that should be useful throughout the study of networks, such as &#8216;decorated cospans&#8217; and &#8216;corelations&#8217;.</p>

<div align="center"><i>To understand ecosystems, ultimately will be to understand networks.</i> &#8211; B. C. Patten and M. Witkamp </div>
<p>A while back I decided one way to apply my math skills to help save the planet was to start pushing toward <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/networks_1.html"><font color="green">green mathematics</font></a>: a kind of mathematics that can interact with biology and ecology just as fruitfully as traditional mathematics interacts with physics.  As usual with math, the payoffs will come slowly, but they may be large.  It&#8217;s not a substitute for doing other, more urgent things&#8212;but if mathematicians don&#8217;t do this, who will?</p>
<p>As a first step in this direction, I decided to study <i>networks</i>.</p>
<p>This May, a small group of mathematicians is meeting in Turin for a workshop on the <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/04/04/categorical-foundations-of-network-theory/">categorical foundations of network theory</a>, organized by <a href="http://www.thequantumnetwork.org/team/jacob-biamonte/">Jacob Biamonte</a>.   I&#8217;m trying to get us mentally prepared for this.  We all have different ideas, yet they should fit together somehow.</p>
<p><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/04/07/resource-convertibility-part-1/">Tobias Fritz</a>, <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2014/03/18/networks-of-dynamical-systems/">Eugene Lerman</a> and <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/03/27/spivak-part-1/">David Spivak</a> have all written articles here about their work, though I suspect Eugene will have a lot of completely new things to say, too.  Now it&#8217;s time for me to say what my students and I have been doing.</p>
<p>Despite my ultimate aim of studying biological and ecological networks, I decided to start by clarifying the math of networks that appear in chemistry and engineering, since these are simpler, better understood, useful in their own right, and probably a good warmup for the grander goal.  I&#8217;ve been working with <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/brendan.fong/">Brendan Fong</a> on electrical ciruits, and with <a href="http://mathdept.ucr.edu/gradwebpages/erbele.html">Jason Erbele</a> on control theory.  Let me talk about this paper:</p>
<p>• John Baez and Jason Erbele, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.6881">Categories in control</a>, <i><a href="http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/30/24/30-24abs.html">Theory and<br />
Applications of Categories</a></i> <b>30</b> (2015), 836&ndash;881.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory">Control theory</a> is the branch of engineering that focuses on manipulating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_system_%28systems_theory%29">open systems</a>—systems with inputs and outputs—to achieve desired goals.  In control theory, <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Control_Systems/Signal_Flow_Diagrams#Resistor_R_.28Branch_equation_.29">signal-flow diagrams</a> are used to describe linear ways of manipulating signals, for example smooth real-valued functions of time.   Here&#8217;s a real-world example; click the picture for more details:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-flow_graph#Mechatronics_:_Position_servo_with_multi-loop_feedback"><br />
<img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/position_servo_signal_flow_graph.png" /><br />
</a></div>
<p>For a category theorist, at least, it is natural to treat signal-flow diagrams as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USYRDDZ9yEc&amp;feature=related">string diagrams</a> in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_monoidal_category">symmetric monoidal category</a>.  This forces some small changes of perspective, which I&#8217;ll explain, but more important is the question: <i>which symmetric monoidal category?</i></p>
<p>We argue that the answer is: the category <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BFinRel%7D_k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{FinRel}_k" class="latex" /> of finite-dimensional vector spaces over a certain field <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k," class="latex" /> but with <i>linear relations</i> rather than linear maps as morphisms, and <i>direct sum</i> rather than tensor product providing the symmetric monoidal structure.  We use the field <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k+%3D+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%28s%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k = &#92;mathbb{R}(s)" class="latex" /> consisting of rational functions in one real variable <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="s." class="latex" />  This variable has the meaning of differentation.  A linear relation from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%5Em&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k^m" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%5En&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k^n" class="latex" /> is thus a system of linear constant-coefficient ordinary differential equations relating <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="m" class="latex" /> &#8216;input&#8217; signals and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" /> &#8216;output&#8217; signals.</p>
<p>Our main goal in this paper is to provide a complete &#8216;generators and relations&#8217; picture of this symmetric monoidal category, with the generators being familiar components of signal-flow diagrams.  It turns out that the answer has an intriguing but mysterious connection to ideas that are familiar in the diagrammatic approach to quantum theory!   Quantum theory also involves linear algebra, but it uses linear maps between Hilbert spaces as morphisms, and the tensor product of Hilbert spaces provides the symmetric monoidal structure.</p>
<p>We hope that the category-theoretic viewpoint on signal-flow diagrams will shed new light on control theory.  However, in this paper we only lay the groundwork.</p>
<h3> Signal flow diagrams </h3>
<p>There are several basic operations that one wants to perform when manipulating signals.  The simplest is multiplying a signal by a scalar.  A signal can be amplified by a constant factor:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f+%5Cmapsto+cf++&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f &#92;mapsto cf  " class="latex" /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c &#92;in &#92;mathbb{R}." class="latex" />  We can write this as a string diagram:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="100" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/generator_scalar_multiplication.jpg" />
</div>
<p>Here the labels <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c f" class="latex" /> on top and bottom are just for explanatory purposes and not really part of the diagram.  Control theorists often draw arrows on the wires, but this is unnecessary from the string diagram perspective.  Arrows on wires are useful to distinguish objects from their<br />
duals, but ultimately we will obtain a compact closed category where each object is its own dual, so the arrows can be dropped.  What we really need is for the box denoting scalar multiplication to have a clearly defined input and output.  This is why we draw it as a triangle.  Control theorists often use a rectangle or circle, using arrows on wires to indicate which carries the input <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" /> and which the output <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+f.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c f." class="latex" /></p>
<p>A signal can also be integrated with respect to the time variable:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f+%5Cmapsto+%5Cint+f+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f &#92;mapsto &#92;int f " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Mathematicians typically take differentiation as fundamental, but engineers sometimes prefer integration, because it is more robust against small perturbations.  In the end it  will not matter much here.  We can again draw integration as a string diagram:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="100" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/generator_integration.jpg" />

<p>Since this looks like the diagram for scalar multiplication, it is natural to extend <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%28s%29%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}(s)," class="latex" /> the field of rational functions of a variable <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="s" class="latex" /> which stands for differentiation.   Then differentiation becomes a special case of scalar multiplication, namely  multiplication by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="s," class="latex" /> and integration becomes multiplication by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2Fs.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="1/s." class="latex" />  Engineers accomplish the same effect with Laplace transforms, since differentiating a signal $f$ is equivalent to multiplying its Laplace transform</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B++%28%5Cmathcal%7BL%7Df%29%28s%29+%3D+%5Cint_0%5E%5Cinfty+f%28t%29+e%5E%7B-st%7D+%5C%2Cdt++%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{  (&#92;mathcal{L}f)(s) = &#92;int_0^&#92;infty f(t) e^{-st} &#92;,dt  }" class="latex" /></p>

<p>by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=-i%5Comega.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="-i&#92;omega." class="latex" />   Of course, the function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" /> needs to be sufficiently well-behaved to justify calculations involving its Laplace or Fourier transform.  At a more basic level, it also requires some work to treat integration as the two-sided inverse of differentiation.  Engineers do this by considering signals that vanish for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t+%3C+0%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="t &lt; 0," class="latex" /> and choosing the antiderivative that vanishes under the same condition.  Luckily all these issues can be side-stepped in a formal treatment of signal-flow diagrams: we can simply treat signals as living in an unspecified vector space over the field <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%28s%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}(s)." class="latex" />  The field <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BC%7D%28s%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{C}(s)" class="latex" /> would work just as well, and control theory relies heavily on complex analysis.   In our paper we work over an arbitrary field <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k." class="latex" /></p>
<p>The simplest possible signal processor is a rock, which takes the &#039;input&#039; given by the force <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F" class="latex" /> on the rock and produces as &#039;output&#039; the rock&#039;s position <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="q." class="latex" />  Thanks to Newton&#039;s second law <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%3Dma%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F=ma," class="latex" /> we can describe this using a signal-flow diagram:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="100" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/signal_flow_diagram_F=ma.jpg" />
</div>
<p>Here composition of morphisms is drawn in the usual way, by attaching the output wire of one morphism to the input wire of the next.</p>
<p>To build more interesting machines we need more building blocks, such as addition:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%2B+%3A+%28f%2Cg%29+%5Cmapsto+f+%2B+g+++&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="+ : (f,g) &#92;mapsto f + g   " class="latex" /></p>
<p>and duplication:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CDelta+%3A++f+%5Cmapsto+%28f%2Cf%29++&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;Delta :  f &#92;mapsto (f,f)  " class="latex" /></p>
<p>When these linear maps are written as matrices, their matrices are transposes of each other.  This is reflected in the string diagrams for addition and duplication:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="350" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/generator_addition_duplication.jpg" />
</div>
<p>The second is essentially an upside-down version of the first.  However, we draw addition as a dark triangle and duplication as a light one because we will later want another way to &#8216;turn addition upside-down&#8217; that does <i>not</i> give duplication.  As an added bonus, a light upside-down triangle resembles the Greek letter <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CDelta%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;Delta," class="latex" /> the usual symbol for duplication.</p>
<p>While they are typically not considered worthy of mention in control theory, for completeness we must include two other building blocks.  One is the zero map from the zero-dimensional vector space <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B0%5C%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;{0&#92;}" class="latex" /> to our field <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k," class="latex" /> which we denote as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="0" class="latex" /> and draw as follows:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="50" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/generator_zero.jpg" />
</div>
<p>The other is the zero map from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B0%5C%7D%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;{0&#92;}," class="latex" /> sometimes called &#8216;deletion&#8217;, which we denote as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%21&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="!" class="latex" /> and draw thus:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="50" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/generator_deletion.jpg" />
</div>
<p>Just as the matrices for addition and duplication are transposes of each other, so are the matrices for zero and deletion, though they are rather degenerate, being <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1+%5Ctimes+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="1 &#92;times 0" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0+%5Ctimes+1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="0 &#92;times 1" class="latex" /> matrices, respectively.  Addition and zero make <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" /> into a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoid_%28category_theory%29"><b>commutative monoid</b></a>, meaning that the following relations hold:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_commutative_monoid.jpg" />
</div>
<p>The equation at right is the commutative law, and the crossing of strands is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braided_monoidal_category">braiding</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B+%3A+%28f%2Cg%29+%5Cmapsto+%28g%2Cf%29++&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B : (f,g) &#92;mapsto (g,f)  " class="latex" /></p>
<p>by which we switch two signals.   In fact this braiding is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_monoidal_category">symmetry</a>, so it does not matter which strand goes over which:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="250" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_symmetry.jpg" />
</div>
<p>Dually, duplication and deletion make <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" /> into a cocommutative <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/comonoid"><b>comonoid</b></a>.  This means that if we reflect the equations obeyed by addition and zero across the horizontal axis and turn dark operations into light ones, we obtain another set of valid equations:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_cocommutative_comonoid.jpg" />
</div>
<p>There are also relations between the monoid and comonoid operations.  For example, adding two signals and then duplicating the result gives the same output as duplicating each signal and then adding the results:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="400" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_bimonoid_multiplication_comultiplication.jpg" />
</div>
<p>This diagram is familiar in the theory of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopf_algebra">Hopf algebras</a>, or more generally <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bialgebra">bialgebras</a>.  Here it is an example of the fact that the monoid operations on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" /> are comonoid homomorphisms—or equivalently, the comonoid operations are monoid homomorphisms.</p>
<p>We summarize this situation by saying that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" /> is a <b>bimonoid</b>.  These are all the bimonoid laws, drawn as diagrams:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="200" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_bimonoid_1.jpg" /><br />
<img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_bimonoid_2.jpg" />
</div>
<p>The last equation means we can actually make the diagram at left disappear, since it equals the identity morphism on the 0-dimensional vector space, which is drawn as <i>nothing</i>.</p>
<p>So far all our string diagrams denote linear maps.  We can treat these as morphisms in the category <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BFinVect%7D_k%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{FinVect}_k," class="latex" /> where objects are finite-dimensional vector spaces over a field <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" /> and morphisms are linear maps.  This category is equivalent to the category where the only objects are vector spaces <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%5En&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k^n" class="latex" /> for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%5Cge+0%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n &#92;ge 0," class="latex" /> and then morphisms can be seen as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%5Ctimes+m&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n &#92;times m" class="latex" /> matrices.  The space of signals is a vector space <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="V" class="latex" /> over <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" /> which may not be finite-dimensional, but this does not cause a problem: an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%5Ctimes+m&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n &#92;times m" class="latex" /> matrix with entries in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" /> still defines a linear map from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V%5En&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="V^n" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V%5Em&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="V^m" class="latex" /> in a functorial way.</p>
<p>In applications of string diagrams to quantum theory, we make <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BFinVect%7D_k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{FinVect}_k" class="latex" /> into a symmetric monoidal category using the tensor product of vector spaces.  In control theory, we instead make <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BFinVect%7D_k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{FinVect}_k" class="latex" /> into a symmetric monoidal category using the <i>direct sum</i> of vector spaces.  In Lemma 1 of our paper we prove that for any field <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k," class="latex" /> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BFinVect%7D_k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{FinVect}_k" class="latex" /> with direct sum is generated as a symmetric monoidal category by the one object <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" /> together with these morphisms:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/generators_FinVect.jpg" />
</div>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+%5Cin+k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c &#92;in k" class="latex" /> is arbitrary.</p>
<p>However, these generating morphisms obey some unexpected relations!  For example, we have:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="400" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_braiding.jpg" />
</div>
<p>Thus, it is important to find a complete set of relations obeyed by these generating morphisms, thus obtaining a presentation of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BFinVect%7D_k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{FinVect}_k" class="latex" /> as a symmetric monoidal category.  We do this in Theorem 2.  In brief, these relations say:</p>
<p>(1) <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28k%2C+%2B%2C+0%2C+%5CDelta%2C+%21%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(k, +, 0, &#92;Delta, !)" class="latex" /> is a bicommutative bimonoid;</p>
<p>(2) the rig operations of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" /> can be recovered from the generating morphisms;</p>
<p>(3) all the generating morphisms commute with scalar multiplication.</p>
<p>Here item (2) means that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%2B%2C+%5Ccdot%2C+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="+, &#92;cdot, 0" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="1" class="latex" /> in the field <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" /> can be expressed in terms of signal-flow diagrams as follows:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_rig_1.jpg" />
</div>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_rig_2.jpg" />
</div>
<p>Multiplicative inverses cannot be so expressed, so our signal-flow diagrams so far do not know that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" /> is a field.  Additive inverses also cannot be expressed in this way.  So, we expect that a version of Theorem 2 will hold whenever <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" /> is a mere <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiring">rig</a>: that is, a &#8216;ring without negatives&#8217;, like the natural numbers.  The one change is that instead of working with vector spaces, we should work with finitely presented free <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" />-modules.</p>
<p>Item (3), the fact that all our generating morphisms commute with scalar multiplication, amounts to these diagrammatic equations:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_linearity_1.jpg" /></p>
<p><img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_linearity_2.jpg" />
</div>
<p>While Theorem 2 is a step towards understanding the category-theoretic underpinnings of control theory, it does not treat signal-flow diagrams that include &#8216;feedback&#8217;.  Feedback is one of the most fundamental concepts in control theory because a control system without feedback may be highly sensitive to disturbances or unmodeled behavior.  Feedback allows these uncontrolled behaviors to be mollified.  As a string diagram, a basic feedback system might look schematically like this:</p>

<p>The user inputs a &#8216;reference&#8217; signal, which is fed into a controller, whose output is fed into a system, which control theorists call a &#8216;plant&#8217;, which in turn produces its own output.  But then the system&#8217;s output is duplicated, and one copy is fed into a sensor, whose output is added (or if we prefer, subtracted) from the reference signal.</p>
<p>In string diagrams—unlike in the usual thinking on control theory—it is essential to be  able to read any diagram from top to bottom as a composite of tensor products of generating morphisms.   Thus, to incorporate the idea of feedback, we need two more generating morphisms.  These are the &#8216;cup&#8217;:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="150" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/generator_cup.jpg" />
</div>
<p>and &#8216;cap&#8217;:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="150" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/generator_cap.jpg" />
</div>
<p>These are not maps: they are relations.  The cup imposes the relation that its two inputs be equal, while the cap does the same for its two outputs.  This is a way of describing how a signal flows around a bend in a wire.</p>
<p>To make this precise, we use a category called <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BFinRel%7D_k.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{FinRel}_k." class="latex" />  An object of this category is a finite-dimensional vector space over <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k," class="latex" /> while a morphism from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=U&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="U" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="V," class="latex" /> denoted <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L+%3A+U+%5Crightharpoonup+V%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="L : U &#92;rightharpoonup V," class="latex" /> is a <b>linear relation</b>, meaning a linear subspace</p>

<p>In particular, when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k+%3D+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%28s%29%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k = &#92;mathbb{R}(s)," class="latex" /> a linear relation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="L" class="latex" /> from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%5Em&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k^m" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%5En&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k^n" class="latex" /> is just an arbitrary system of constant-coefficient linear ordinary differential equations relating <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="m" class="latex" /> input variables and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" /> output variables.</p>
<p>Since the direct sum <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=U+%5Coplus+V&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="U &#92;oplus V" class="latex" /> is also the cartesian product of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=U&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="U" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="V," class="latex" /> a linear relation is indeed a relation in the usual sense, but with the property that if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u+%5Cin+U&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="u &#92;in U" class="latex" /> is  related to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v+%5Cin+V&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="v &#92;in V" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%27+%5Cin+U&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="u&#039; &#92;in U" class="latex" /> is related to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v%27+%5Cin+V&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="v&#039; &#92;in V" class="latex" /> then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=cu+%2B+c%27u%27&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="cu + c&#039;u&#039;" class="latex" /> is related to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=cv+%2B+c%27v%27&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="cv + c&#039;v&#039;" class="latex" /> whenever <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%2Cc%27+%5Cin+k.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c,c&#039; &#92;in k." class="latex" /></p>
<p>We compose linear relations <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L+%3A+U+%5Crightharpoonup+V&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="L : U &#92;rightharpoonup V" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%27+%3A+V+%5Crightharpoonup+W&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="L&#039; : V &#92;rightharpoonup W" class="latex" /> as follows:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%27L+%3D+%5C%7B%28u%2Cw%29+%5Ccolon+%5C%3B+%5Cexists%5C%3B+v+%5Cin+V+%5C%3B%5C%3B+%28u%2Cv%29+%5Cin+L+%5Ctextrm%7B+and+%7D+%28v%2Cw%29+%5Cin+L%27%5C%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="L&#039;L = &#92;{(u,w) &#92;colon &#92;; &#92;exists&#92;; v &#92;in V &#92;;&#92;; (u,v) &#92;in L &#92;textrm{ and } (v,w) &#92;in L&#039;&#92;} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Any linear map <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f+%3A+U+%5Cto+V&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f : U &#92;to V" class="latex" /> gives a linear relation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F+%3A+U+%5Crightharpoonup+V%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F : U &#92;rightharpoonup V," class="latex" /> namely the graph of that map:</p>

<p>Composing linear maps thus becomes a special case of composing linear relations, so <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BFinVect%7D_k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{FinVect}_k" class="latex" /> becomes a subcategory of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BFinRel%7D_k.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{FinRel}_k." class="latex" />  Furthermore, we can make <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BFinRel%7D_k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{FinRel}_k" class="latex" /> into a monoidal category using direct sums, and it becomes symmetric monoidal using the braiding already present in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BFinVect%7D_k.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{FinVect}_k." class="latex" /></p>
<p>In these terms, the <b>cup</b> is the linear relation</p>

<p>while the <b>cap</b> is the linear relation</p>

<p>These obey the <b>zigzag relations</b>:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_zigzag.jpg" />
</div>
<p>Thus, they make <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BFinRel%7D_k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{FinRel}_k" class="latex" /> into a compact closed category where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k," class="latex" /> and thus every object, is its own dual.</p>
<p>Besides feedback, one of the things that make the cap and cup useful is that they allow any morphism <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L+%3A+U+%5Crightharpoonup+V+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="L : U &#92;rightharpoonup V " class="latex" /> to be &#8216;plugged in backwards&#8217; and thus &#8216;turned around&#8217;.  For instance, turning around integration:</p>

<img width="150" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/signal_flow_diagram_flipped_integration.jpg" />

<p>we obtain differentiation.  In general, using caps and cups we can turn around any linear relation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L+%3A+U+%5Crightharpoonup+V&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="L : U &#92;rightharpoonup V" class="latex" /> and obtain a linear relation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%5E%5Cdagger+%3A+V+%5Crightharpoonup+U%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="L^&#92;dagger : V &#92;rightharpoonup U," class="latex" /> called the <b>adjoint</b> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="L," class="latex" /> which turns out to given by</p>

<p>For example, if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+%5Cin+k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c &#92;in k" class="latex" /> is nonzero, the adjoint of scalar multiplication by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c" class="latex" /> is multiplication by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%5E%7B-1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c^{-1}" class="latex" />:</p>

<p>Thus, caps and cups allow us to express multiplicative inverses in terms of signal-flow diagrams! One might think that a problem arises when when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+%3D+0%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c = 0," class="latex" /> but no: the adjoint of scalar multiplication by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="0" class="latex" /> is</p>

<p>In Lemma 3 we show that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BFinRel%7D_k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{FinRel}_k" class="latex" /> is generated, as a symmetric monoidal category, by these morphisms:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/generators_FinRel.jpg" />
</div>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+%5Cin+k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c &#92;in k" class="latex" /> is arbitrary.</p>
<p>In Theorem 4 we find a complete set of relations obeyed by these generating morphisms,thus giving a presentation of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BFinRel%7D_k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{FinRel}_k" class="latex" /> as a symmetric monoidal category.  To describe these relations, it is useful to work with adjoints of the generating morphisms.  We have already seen that the adjoint of scalar multiplication by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c" class="latex" /> is scalar multiplication by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%5E%7B-1%7D%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c^{-1}," class="latex" /> except when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+%3D+0.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c = 0." class="latex" />  Taking adjoints of the other four generating morphisms of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BFinVect%7D_k%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{FinVect}_k," class="latex" /> we obtain four important but perhaps unfamiliar linear relations.  We draw these as &#8216;turned around&#8217; versions of the original generating morphisms:</p>
<p>• <b>Coaddition</b> is a linear relation from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k^2" class="latex" /> that holds when the two outputs sum to the input:</p>

<p>Starting around 2008, commutative special †-Frobenius monoids have become important in the categorical foundations of quantum theory, where they can be understood as &#8216;classical structures&#8217; for quantum systems.

<p>Conversely, any commutative special †-Frobenius monoid in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BFinHilb%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{FinHilb}" class="latex" /> arises this way.</p>
<p>Considerably earlier, around 1995, commutative Frobenius monoids were recognized as important in topological quantum field theory.  The reason, ultimately, is that the free symmetric monoidal category on a commutative Frobenius monoid is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5Cmathrm%7BCob%7D%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="2&#92;mathrm{Cob}," class="latex" /> the category with 2-dimensional oriented cobordisms as morphisms.  But the free symmetric monoidal category on a commutative <i>special</i> Frobenius monoid was worked out even earlier: it is the category with finite sets as objects, where a morphism <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f+%3A+X+%5Cto+Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f : X &#92;to Y" class="latex" /> is an isomorphism class of cospans</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X+%5Clongrightarrow+S+%5Clongleftarrow+Y++&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X &#92;longrightarrow S &#92;longleftarrow Y  " class="latex" /></p>
<p>This category can be made into a †-compact category in an obvious way, and then the 1-element set becomes a commutative special †-Frobenius monoid.</p>
<p>For all these reasons, it is interesting to find a commutative special †-Frobenius monoid lurking at the heart of control theory!  However, the Frobenius monoid here has yet another property, which is more unusual.  Namely, the unit <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0+%3A+%5C%7B0%5C%7D+%5Crightharpoonup+k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="0 : &#92;{0&#92;} &#92;rightharpoonup k" class="latex" /> followed by the counit <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0%5E%5Cdagger+%3A+k+%5Crightharpoonup+%5C%7B0%5C%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="0^&#92;dagger : k &#92;rightharpoonup &#92;{0&#92;} " class="latex" /> is the identity:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="100" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_extra_addition.jpg" />
</div>
<p>We call a special Frobenius monoid that also obeys this extra law <b>extra-special</b>.  One can check that the free symmetric monoidal category on a commutative extra-special Frobenius monoid is the category with finite sets as objects, where a morphism <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f+%3A+X+%5Cto+Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f : X &#92;to Y" class="latex" /> is an equivalence relation on the disjoint union <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X+%5Csqcup+Y%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X &#92;sqcup Y," class="latex" /> and we compose <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f+%3A+X+%5Cto+Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f : X &#92;to Y" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g+%3A+Y+%5Cto+Z&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="g : Y &#92;to Z" class="latex" /> by letting <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="g" class="latex" /> generate an equivalence relation on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X+%5Csqcup+Y+%5Csqcup+Z&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X &#92;sqcup Y &#92;sqcup Z" class="latex" /> and then restricting this to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X+%5Csqcup+Z.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X &#92;sqcup Z." class="latex" /></p>
<p>As if this were not enough, the light operations share many properties with the dark ones.  In particular, these operations make <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" /> into a commutative extra-special †-Frobenius monoid in a second way.

<p>It should be no surprise that with all these structures built in, signal-flow diagrams are a powerful method of designing processes.</p>
<p>However, it is surprising that most of these structures are present in a seemingly very different context: the so-called <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.4725">ZX calculus</a>, a diagrammatic formalism for working with complementary observables in quantum theory.  This arises naturally when one has an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" />-dimensional Hilbert space $H$ with two orthonormal bases <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpsi_i%2C+%5Cphi_i+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;psi_i, &#92;phi_i " class="latex" /> that are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutually_unbiased_bases">mutually unbiased</a>, meaning that</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7C%5Clangle+%5Cpsi_i%2C+%5Cphi_j+%5Crangle%7C%5E2+%3D+%5Cdisplaystyle%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%7D%7D++&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="|&#92;langle &#92;psi_i, &#92;phi_j &#92;rangle|^2 = &#92;displaystyle{&#92;frac{1}{n}}  " class="latex" /></p>
<p>for all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1+%5Cle+i%2C+j+%5Cle+n.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="1 &#92;le i, j &#92;le n." class="latex" />  Each orthonormal basis makes <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="H" class="latex" /> into commutative special †-Frobenius monoid in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BFinHilb%7D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{FinHilb}." class="latex" />  Moreover, the multiplication and unit of either one of these Frobenius monoids fits together with the comultiplication and counit of the other to form a bicommutative bimonoid.  So, we have all the structure present in the list above—except that these Frobenius monoids are only extra-special if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="H" class="latex" /> is 1-dimensional.</p>
<p>The field <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" /> is also a 1-dimensional vector space, but this is a red herring: in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BFinRel%7D_k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{FinRel}_k" class="latex" /> <i>every</i> finite-dimensional vector space naturally acquires all four structures listed above, since addition, zero, duplication and deletion are well-defined and obey all the relations we have discussed.  Jason and I focus on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" /> in our paper simply because it generates all the objects <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BFinRel%7D_k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{FinRel}_k" class="latex" /> via direct sum.</p>
<p>Finally, in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BFinRel%7D_k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{FinRel}_k" class="latex" /> the cap and cup are related to the light and dark operations as follows:</p>
<div align="center">

<p><img width="230" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_cup.jpg" />
</div>
<p>Note the curious factor of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=-1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="-1" class="latex" /> in the second equation, which breaks some of the symmetry we have seen so far.  This equation says that two elements <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2C+y+%5Cin+k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x, y &#92;in k" class="latex" /> sum to zero if and only if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=-x+%3D+y.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="-x = y." class="latex" />  Using the zigzag relations, the two equations above give</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="200" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/signal_flow/relation_cap_cup.jpg" />
</div>
<p>We thus see that in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BFinRel%7D_k%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{FinRel}_k," class="latex" /> both additive and multiplicative inverses can be expressed in terms of the generating morphisms used in signal-flow diagrams.</p>
<p>Theorem 4 of our paper gives a presentation of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BFinRel%7D_k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{FinRel}_k" class="latex" /> based on the ideas just discussed.  Briefly, it says that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BFinRel%7D_k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{FinRel}_k" class="latex" /> is equivalent to the symmetric monoidal category generated by an object <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" /> and these morphisms:</p>

Item (5) means that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%2B%2C+%5Ccdot%2C+0%2C+1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="+, &#92;cdot, 0, 1" class="latex" /> and also additive and multiplicative inverses in the field <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" /> can be expressed in terms of signal-flow diagrams in the manner we have explained.</p>
<p>So, we have a good categorical understanding of the linear algebra used in signal flow diagrams!</p>
<p>Now Jason is moving ahead to apply this to some interesting problems&#8230; but that&#8217;s another story, for later.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p><i>guest post by <b><a href="http://perimeterinstitute.ca/personal/tfritz/">Tobias Fritz</a></b></i></p>
<p>In <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/04/07/resource-convertibility-part-1/">Part 1</a> and <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/04/10/resource-convertibility-part-2/">Part 2</a>, we learnt about ordered commutative monoids and how they formalize theories of resource convertibility and combinability. In this post, I would like to say a bit about the applications that have been explored so far. First, the study of resource theories has become a popular subject in quantum information theory, and many of the ideas in my paper actually originate there. I&#8217;ll list some references at the end. So I hope that the toolbox of ordered commutative monoids will turn out to be useful for this. But here I would like to talk about an example application that is much easier to understand, but no less difficult to analyze: graph theory and the resource theory of zero-error communication.</p>
<p>A graph consists of a bunch of nodes connected by a bunch of edges, for example like this:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/fritz_resource/pentagon.jpg" alt="" width="250" /></div>
<p>This particular graph is the <i>pentagon graph</i> or <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_graph">5-cycle</a></i>. To give it some resource-theoretic interpretation, think of it as the <i>distinguishability graph</i> of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_%28communications%29">communication channel</a>, where the nodes are the symbols that can be sent across the channel, and two symbols share an edge if and only if they can be unambiguously decoded. For example, the pentagon graph roughly corresponds to the distinguishability graph of my handwriting, when restricted to five letters only:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/fritz_resource/handwriting.jpg" alt="" width="250" /></div>
<p>So my &#8216;w&#8217; is distinguishable from my &#8216;u&#8217;, but it may be confused for my &#8216;m&#8217;. In order to communicate unambiguously, it looks like I should restrict myself to using only two of those letters in writing, since any third of them may be mistaken for one of the other three. But alternatively, I could use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_code">block code</a> to create context around each letter which allows for perfect disambiguation. This is what happens in practice: I write in natural language, where an entire word is usually not ambiguous.</p>
<p>One can now also consider graph homomorphisms, which are maps like this:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/fritz_resource/graph_homomorphism.jpg" alt="" width="450" /></div>
<p>The numbers on the nodes indicate where each node on the left gets mapped to. Formally, a graph homomorphism is a function taking nodes to nodes such that adjacent nodes get mapped to adjacent nodes. If a homomorphism <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G%5Cto+H&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="G&#92;to H" class="latex" /> exists between graphs <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="G" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="H," class="latex" /> then we also write <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H%5Cgeq+G&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="H&#92;geq G" class="latex" />; in terms of communication channels, we can interpret this as saying that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="H" class="latex" /> simulates <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="G," class="latex" /> since the homomorphism provides a map between the symbols which preserves distinguishability. A &#8216;code&#8217; for a communication channel is then just a homomorphism from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_graph">complete graph</a> in which all nodes share an edge to the graph which describes the channel. With this ordering structure, the collection of all finite graphs forms an ordered set. This ordered set has an intricate structure which is <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2014/12/graph_colouring_and_cartesian.html#c047834">intimately related</a> to some big open problems in graph theory.</p>
<p>We can also combine two communication channels to form a compound one. Going back to the handwriting example, we can consider the new channel in which the symbols are pairs of letters. Two such pairs are distinguishable if and only if either the first letters of each pair are distinguishable or the second letters are,</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28a%2Cb%29+%5Csim+%28a%27%2Cb%27%29+%5C%3A%5CLeftrightarrow%5C%3A+a%5Csim+a%27+%5C%3A%5Clor%5C%3A+b%5Csim+b%27&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(a,b) &#92;sim (a&#039;,b&#039;) &#92;:&#92;Leftrightarrow&#92;: a&#92;sim a&#039; &#92;:&#92;lor&#92;: b&#92;sim b&#039;" class="latex" /></p>
<p>When generalized to arbitrary graphs, this yields the definition of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_product">disjunctive product</a> of graphs. It is not hard to show that this equips the ordered set of graphs with a binary operation compatible with the ordering, so that we obtain an ordered commutative monoid denoted <b>Grph</b>. It mathematically formalizes the resource theory of zero-error communication.</p>
<p>Using the toolbox of ordered commutative monoids combined with some concrete computations on graphs, one can show that <b>Grph</b> is not cancellative: if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K_%7B11%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="K_{11}" class="latex" /> is the complete graph on 11 nodes, then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3C_5%5Cnot%5Cgeq+K_%7B11%7D%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="3C_5&#92;not&#92;geq K_{11}," class="latex" /> but there exists a graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="G" class="latex" /> such that</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3+C_5+%2B+G+%5Cgeq+K_%7B11%7D+%2B+G&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="3 C_5 + G &#92;geq K_{11} + G" class="latex" /></p>
<p>The graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="G" class="latex" /> turns out to have 136 nodes. This result seems to be new. But if you happen to have seen something like this before, please let me know!</p>
<p><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/04/10/resource-convertibility-part-2/">Last time</a>, we also talked about rates of conversion. In <b>Grph</b>, it turns out that some of these correspond to famous graph invariants! For example, the rate of conversion from a graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="G" class="latex" /> to the single-edge graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K_2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="K_2" class="latex" /> is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_capacity_of_a_graph">Shannon capacity</a> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CTheta%28%5Coverline%7BG%7D%29%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;Theta(&#92;overline{G})," class="latex" /> where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BG%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;overline{G}" class="latex" /> is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_graph">complement graph</a>. This is of no surprise since <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CTheta&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;Theta" class="latex" /> was originally defined by Shannon with precisely this rate in mind, although he did not use the language of ordered commutative monoids. In any case, the Shannon capacity <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CTheta%28%5Coverline%7BG%7D%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;Theta(&#92;overline{G})" class="latex" /> is a graph invariant <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0608021">notorious</a> for its complexity: it is not known whether there exists an algorithm to compute it! But an application of the Rate Theorem from Part 2 gives us a formula for the Shannon capacity:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CTheta%28%5Coverline%7BG%7D%29+%3D+%5Cinf_f+f%28G%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;Theta(&#92;overline{G}) = &#92;inf_f f(G)" class="latex" /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" /> ranges over all graph invariants which are monotone under graph homomorphisms, multiplicative under disjunctive product, and normalized such that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28K_2%29+%3D+2.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f(K_2) = 2." class="latex" /> Unfortunately, this formula still not produce an algorithm for computing <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CTheta.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;Theta." class="latex" /> But it nonconstructively proves the existence of many new graph invariants <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" /> which approximate the Shannon capacity from above.</p>
<p>Although my story ends here, I also feel that the whole project has barely started. There are lots of directions to explore! For example, it would be great to fit Shannon&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noisy-channel_coding_theorem">noisy channel coding theorem</a> into this framework, but this has turned out be technically challenging. If you happen to be familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate%E2%80%93distortion_theory">rate-distortion theory</a> and you want to help out, please get in touch!</p>

<p>In <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/04/07/resource-convertibility-part-1/">Part 1</a>, I introduced ordered commutative monoids as a mathematical formalization of resources and their convertibility. Today I&#8217;m going to say something about what to do with this formalization. Let&#8217;s start with a quick recap!</p>
<p><b>Definition</b>: An <b>ordered commutative monoid</b> is a set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> equipped with a binary relation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgeq%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;geq," class="latex" /> a binary operation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%2B%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="+," class="latex" /> and a distinguished element <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="0" class="latex" /> such that the following hold:</p>
<p>&bull; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%2B&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="+" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="0" class="latex" /> equip <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> with the structure of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoid#Commutative_monoid">commutative monoid</a>;</p>
<p>&bull; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgeq&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;geq" class="latex" /> equips <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> with the structure of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set">partially ordered set</a>;</p>
<p>&bull; addition is monotone: if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5Cgeq+y%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x&#92;geq y," class="latex" /> then also <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%2B+z+%5Cgeq+y+%2B+z.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x + z &#92;geq y + z." class="latex" /></p>
<p>Recall also that we think of the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2Cy%5Cin+A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x,y&#92;in A" class="latex" /> as resource objects such that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2By&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x+y" class="latex" /> represents the object consisting of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y" class="latex" /> together, and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5Cgeq+y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x&#92;geq y" class="latex" /> means that the resource object <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> can be converted into <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y." class="latex" /></p>
<p>When confronted with an abstract definition like this, many people ask: so what is it useful for? The answer to this is twofold: first, it provides a language which we can use to guide our thoughts in any application context. Second, the <i>definition</i> itself is just the very start: we can now also prove <i>theorems</i> about ordered commutative monoids, which can be instantiated in any particular application context. So the theory of ordered commutative monoids will provide a useful toolbox for talking about concrete resource theories and studying them. In the remainder of this post, I&#8217;d like to say a bit about what this toolbox contains. For more, you&#8217;ll have to read <a href="http://perimeterinstitute.ca/personal/tfritz/ordered_commutative_monoids.pdf">the paper</a>!</p>
<p>To start, let&#8217;s consider <i>catalysis</i> as one of the resource-theoretic phenomena neatly captured by ordered commutative monoids. Catalysis is the phenomenon that certain conversions become possible only due to the presence of a <b>catalyst</b>, which is an additional resource object which does not get consumed in the process of the conversion. For example, we have</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctext%7Btimber+%2B+nails%7D%5Cnot%5Cgeq+%5Ctext%7Btable%7D%2C+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;text{timber + nails}&#92;not&#92;geq &#92;text{table}, " class="latex" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctext%7Btimber+%2B+nails+%2B+saw+%2B+hammer%7D+%5Cgeq+%5Ctext%7Btable+%2B+saw+%2B+hammer%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;text{timber + nails + saw + hammer} &#92;geq &#92;text{table + saw + hammer}" class="latex" /></p>
<p>because making a table from timber and nails requires a saw and a hammer as tools. So in this example, &#8216;saw <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%2B&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="+" class="latex" /> hammer&#8217; is a catalyst for the conversion of &#8216;timber <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%2B&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="+" class="latex" /> nails&#8217; into &#8216;table&#8217;. In mathematical language, catalysis occurs precisely when the ordered commutative monoid is not <b>cancellative</b>, which means that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%2B+z%5Cgeq+y+%2B+z&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x + z&#92;geq y + z" class="latex" /> sometimes holds even though <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5Cgeq+y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x&#92;geq y" class="latex" /> does not. So, the notion of catalysis perfectly matches up with a very natural and familiar notion from algebra.</p>
<p>One can continue along these lines and study those ordered commutative monoids which are cancellative. It turns out that every ordered commutative monoid can be <i>made</i> cancellative in a universal way; in the resource-theoretic interpretation, this boils down to replacing the convertibility relation by <b>catalytic convertibility</b>, in which <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> is declared to be convertible into <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y" class="latex" /> as soon as there exists a catalyst which achieves this conversion. Making an ordered commutative monoid cancellative like this is a kind of &#8216;regularization&#8217;: it leads to a mathematically more well-behaved structure. As it turns out, there are several additional steps of regularization that can be performed, and all of these are both mathematically natural and have an appealing resource-theoretic interpretation. These regularizations successively take us from the world of ordered commutative monoids to the realm of linear algebra and functional analysis, where powerful theorems are available. For now, let me not go into the details, but only try to summarize one of the consequences of this development. This requires a bit of preparation.</p>
<p>In many situations, it is not just of interest to convert a single copy of some resource object <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> into a single copy of some <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3B&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y;" class="latex" /> instead, one may be interested in converting <i>many</i> copies of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> into <i>many</i> copies of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y" class="latex" /> all together, and thereby maximizing (or minimizing) the ratio of the resulting number of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y" class="latex" />&#8216;s compared to the number of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" />&#8216;s that get consumed. This ratio is measured by the maximal rate:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+R_%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bmax%7D%7D%28x%5Cto+y%29+%3D+%5Csup+%5Cleft%5C%7B+%5Cfrac%7Bm%7D%7Bn%7D+%5C%3A%7C%5C%3A+nx+%5Cgeq+my+%5Cright%5C%7D+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ R_{&#92;mathrm{max}}(x&#92;to y) = &#92;sup &#92;left&#92;{ &#92;frac{m}{n} &#92;:|&#92;: nx &#92;geq my &#92;right&#92;} }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>Here, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="m" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" /> are natural numbers, and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=nx&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="nx" class="latex" /> stands for the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" />-fold sum <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2B%5Ccdots%2Bx%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x+&#92;cdots+x," class="latex" /> and similarly for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=my.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="my." class="latex" /> So this maximal rate quantifies how many <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y" class="latex" />’ s we can get out of one copy of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x," class="latex" /> when working in a &#8216;mass production&#8217; setting. There is also a notion of <b>regularized rate</b>, which has a slightly more complicated definition that I don&#8217;t want to spell out here, but is similar in spirit. The toolbox of ordered commutative monoids now provides the following result:</p>
<p><b>Rate Theorem:</b> If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5Cgeq+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x&#92;geq 0" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%5Cgeq+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y&#92;geq 0" class="latex" /> in an ordered commutative monoid <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> which satisfies a mild technical assumption, then the maximal regularized rate from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y" class="latex" /> can be computed like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+R_%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bmax%7D%7D%5E%7B%5Cmathrm%7Breg%7D%7D%28x%5Cto+y%29+%3D+%5Cinf_f+%5Cfrac%7Bf%28y%29%7D%7Bf%28x%29%7D+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ R_{&#92;mathrm{max}}^{&#92;mathrm{reg}}(x&#92;to y) = &#92;inf_f &#92;frac{f(y)}{f(x)} }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" /> ranges over all functionals on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28y%29%5Cneq+0.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f(y)&#92;neq 0." class="latex" /></p>
<p>Wait a minute, what&#8217;s a &#8216;functional&#8217;? It&#8217;s defined to be a map <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%3AA%5Cto%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f:A&#92;to&#92;mathbb{R}" class="latex" /> which is monotone,</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5Cgeq+y+%5C%3A%5CRightarrow%5C%3A+f%28x%29%5Cgeq+f%28y%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x&#92;geq y &#92;:&#92;Rightarrow&#92;: f(x)&#92;geq f(y)" class="latex" /></p>
<p>and additive,</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%2By%29+%3D+f%28x%29+%2B+f%28y%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y)" class="latex" /></p>
<p>In economic terms, we can think of a functional as a consistent assignment of prices to all resource objects. If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> is at least as useful as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y," class="latex" /> then the price of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> should be at least as high as the price of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y" class="latex" />; and the price of two objects together should be the sum of their individual prices. So the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" /> in the rate formula above ranges over all &#8216;markets&#8217; on which resource objects can be &#8216;traded&#8217; at consistent prices. The term &#8216;functional&#8217; is supposed to hint at a relation to functional analysis. In fact, the proof of the theorem crucially relies on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hahn%E2%80%93Banach_theorem">Hahn&ndash;Banach Theorem</a>.</p>
<p>The mild technical mentioned in the Rate Theorem is that the ordered commutative monoid needs to have a <b>generating pair</b>. This turns out to hold in the applications that I have considered so far, and I hope that it will turn out to hold in most others as well. For the full gory details, see <a href="http://perimeterinstitute.ca/personal/tfritz/ordered_commutative_monoids.pdf">the paper</a>.</p>
<p>So this provides some idea of what kinds of gadgets one can find in the toolbox of ordered commutative monoids. Next time, I&#8217;ll show some applications to graph theory and zero-error communication and say a bit about where this project might be going next.</p>

					<p><i>guest post by <b><a href="http://perimeterinstitute.ca/personal/tfritz/">Tobias Fritz</a></b></i></p>
<p>Hi! I am Tobias Fritz, a mathematician at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Canada. I like to work on all sorts of mathematical structures which pop up in probability theory, information theory, and other sorts of applied math. Today I would like to tell you about my latest paper:</p>
<p>&bull;  <a href="http://perimeterinstitute.ca/personal/tfritz/ordered_commutative_monoids.pdf">The mathematical structure of theories of resource convertibility, I</a>.</p>
<p>It should be of interest to Azimuth readers as it forms part of what John likes to call <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2013/02/15/prospects-for-a-green-mathematics/">&#8216;green mathematics&#8217;</a>. So let&#8217;s get started!</p>
<p>Resources and their management are an essential part of our everyday life. We deal with the management of time or money pretty much every day. We also consume natural resources in order to afford food and amenities for (some of) the 7 billion people on our planet. Many of the objects that we deal with in science and engineering can be considered as resources. For example, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_%28communications%29">communication channel</a> is a resource for sending information from one party to another. But for now, let&#8217;s stick with a toy example: timber and nails constitute a resource for making a table. In mathematical notation, this looks like so:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7Btimber%7D+%2B+%5Cmathrm%7Bnails%7D+%5Cgeq+%5Cmathrm%7Btable%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{timber} + &#92;mathrm{nails} &#92;geq &#92;mathrm{table}" class="latex" /></p>
<p>We interpret this inequality as saying that &#8220;given timber and nails, we can make a table&#8221;. I like to write it as an inequality like this, which I think of as stating that having timber and nails is at least as good as having a table, because the timber and nails can always be turned into a table whenever one needs a table.</p>
<p>To be more precise, we should also take into account that making the table requires some tools. These tools do not get consumed in the process, so we also get them back out:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctext%7Btimber%7D+%2B+%5Ctext%7Bnails%7D+%2B+%5Ctext%7Bsaw%7D+%2B+%5Ctext%7Bhammer%7D+%5Cgeq+%5Ctext%7Btable%7D+%2B+%5Ctext%7Bhammer%7D+%2B+%5Ctext%7Bsaw%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;text{timber} + &#92;text{nails} + &#92;text{saw} + &#92;text{hammer} &#92;geq &#92;text{table} + &#92;text{hammer} + &#92;text{saw}" class="latex" /></p>
<p>Notice that this kind of equation is analogous to a chemical reaction equation like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2+%5Cmathrm%7BH%7D_2+%2B+%5Cmathrm%7BO%7D_2+%5Cgeq+%5Cmathrm%7BH%7D_2%5Cmathrm%7BO%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="2 &#92;mathrm{H}_2 + &#92;mathrm{O}_2 &#92;geq &#92;mathrm{H}_2&#92;mathrm{O} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>So given a hydrogen molecules and an oxygen molecule, we can let them react such as to form a molecule of water. In chemistry, this kind of equation would usually be written with an arrow &#8216;<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crightarrow&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;rightarrow" class="latex" />’  instead of an ordering symbol &#8216;<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgeq&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;geq" class="latex" />’ , but here we interpret the equation slightly differently. As with the timber and the nails and nails above, the inequality says that if we have two hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom, then we <i>can</i> let them react to a molecule of water, but we don&#8217;t <i>have</i> to. In this sense, having two hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom is at least as good as having a molecule of water.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s going on here, mathematically? In all of the above equations, we have a bunch of stuff on each side and an inequality &#8216;<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgeq&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;geq" class="latex" />’  in between. The stuff on each side consists of a bunch of objects tacked together via &#8216;<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%2B&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="+" class="latex" />’ . With respect to these two pieces of structure, the collection of all our resource objects forms an <i>ordered commutative monoid</i>:</p>
<p><b>Definition</b>: An ordered commutative monoid is a set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> equipped with a binary relation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgeq%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;geq," class="latex" /> a binary operation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%2B%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="+," class="latex" /> and a distinguished element <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="0" class="latex" /> such that the following hold:</p>
<p>&bull; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%2B&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="+" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="0" class="latex" /> equip <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> with the structure of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoid#Commutative_monoid">commutative monoid</a>;</p>
<p>&bull; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgeq&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;geq" class="latex" /> equips <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> with the structure of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set">partially ordered set</a>;</p>
<p>&bull; addition is monotone: if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5Cgeq+y%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x&#92;geq y," class="latex" /> then also <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%2B+z+%5Cgeq+y+%2B+z.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x + z &#92;geq y + z." class="latex" /></p>
<p>Here, the third axiom is the most important, since it tells us how the additive structure interacts with the ordering structure.</p>
<p>Ordered commutative monoids are the mathematical formalization of resource convertibility and combinability as follows. The elements <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2Cy%5Cin+A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x,y&#92;in A" class="latex" /> are the resource objects, corresponding to the &#8216;collections of stuff&#8217; in our earlier examples, such as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%3D+%5Ctext%7Btimber%7D+%2B+%5Ctext%7Bnails%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x = &#92;text{timber} + &#92;text{nails}" class="latex" /> or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y+%3D+2+%5Ctext%7BH%7D_2+%2B+%5Ctext%7BO%7D_2.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y = 2 &#92;text{H}_2 + &#92;text{O}_2." class="latex" /> Then the addition operation simply joins up collections of stuff into bigger collections of stuff. The ordering relation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgeq&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;geq" class="latex" /> is what formalizes resource convertibility, as in the examples above. The third axiom states that if we can convert <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> into <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y," class="latex" /> then we can also convert <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> together with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="z" class="latex" /> into <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y" class="latex" /> together with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="z" class="latex" /> for any <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="z," class="latex" /> for example by doing nothing to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="z." class="latex" /></p>
<p>A mathematically minded reader might object that requiring <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> to form a partially ordered set under <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgeq&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;geq" class="latex" /> is too strong a requirement, since it requires two resource objects to be equal as soon as they are mutually interconvertible: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%5Cgeq+y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x &#92;geq y" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y+%5Cgeq+x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y &#92;geq x" class="latex" /> implies <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%3D+y.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x = y." class="latex" /> However, I think that this is not an essential restriction, because we can regard this implication as the <i>definition</i> of equality: &#8216;<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%3D+y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x = y" class="latex" />’ is just a shorthand notation for &#8216;<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5Cgeq+y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x&#92;geq y" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%5Cgeq+x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y&#92;geq x" class="latex" />’ which formalizes the perfect interconvertibility of resource objects.</p>
<p>We could now go back to the original examples and try to model carpentry and chemistry in terms of ordered commutative monoids. But as a mathematician, I needed to start out with something mathematically precise and rigorous as a testing ground for the formalism. This helps ensure that the mathematics is sensible and useful before diving into real-world applications. So, the main example in my paper is the ordered commutative monoid of graphs, which has a resource-theoretic interpretation in terms of <a href="http://alon.ucsd.edu/papers/zer_err_it.ps">zero-error information theory</a>. As graph theory is a difficult and traditional subject, this application constitutes the perfect training camp for the mathematics of ordered commutative monoids. I will get to this in Part 3.</p>
<p>In Part 2, I will say something about what one can do with ordered commutative monoids. In the meantime, I&#8217;d be curious to know what you think about what I&#8217;ve said so far!</p>

<p>&bull; <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/03/27/spivak-part-1/">Part 1: The problem</a>.</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/03/30/spivak-part-2/">Part 2: Creating a knowledge network</a>.</p>
<h3>From parts to wholes</h3>
<p>Remember where we were.  Ologs, linguistically-enhanced sketches, just weren’t doing justice to the idea that each step in a recipe is itself a recipe. But the idea seemed ripe for mathematical formulation.</p>
<p>Thus, I returned to a question I’d wondered about in the very beginning: how is macro-understanding built from micro-understanding? How can multiple individual humans come together, like cells in a multicellular organism, to make a whole that is itself a surviving decision-maker?</p>
<p>There were, and continue to be, a lot of “open-to-Spivak” questions one can ask: How are stories about events built from sub-stories about sub-events? How is macro-economics built from micro-economics? Are large-scale phenomena always based on, and relatable to, interactions between smaller-scale phenomena? For example, I still want to understand, in very basic terms, how classical (large-scale) phenomena are a manifestation of quantum phenomena.</p>
<p>Neuroscience professor <a href="https://www.psych.ucsb.edu/people/faculty/gazzaniga">Michael Gazzaniga</a> has a similar question: How does cognition arise from the interaction of tiny event-noticers, and how does society emerge and effect individual brains? As put it in the last paragraph of his book <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4IgZUUe5dc">Who’s In Charge</a></i>, we are in need of a language by which to understand the interfaces of “our layered hierarchical existence”, because doing so “holds the answer to our quest for understanding mind/brain relationships.” He goes on:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Understanding how to develop a vocabulary for those layered interactions, for me, constitutes the scientific problem of this century.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I tend to be infatuated with this same kind of idea: cognition emerging from interactions between sub-cognitive pieces. This is what got me interested in what I now call “operadic modularity”. Luckily again, my Office of Naval Research hero (now at the Air Force Office of Scientific Research) granted me a chance to <a href="//math.mit.edu/~dspivak/informatics/grants/AFOSR--Proposal.pdf">study it</a>.</p>
<p>The idea is this: modularity is about arranging many modules into a single whole, which is another module, usable as part of a larger system. Each system of modules is a module of its own, and we see the nesting phenomenon. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operad_theory">Operads</a> can model the language of <i>nestable interface arrangements</i>, and their algebras can model how interfaces are filled in with the required sorts of modules.</p>
<p>Here, by operad, I mean symmetric colored operad, or <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/symmetric+multicategory">symmetric multicategory</a>. Operads are like categories—they have objects, morphisms, identities, and a unital and associative composition formula—the difference is that the domain of a morphism is a finite set of objects (in an operad) rather than a single object (as in a category). So morphisms in an operad are written like <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cvarphi%5Ccolon+X_1%2C%5Cldots%2CX_n%5Cto+Y%3B&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;varphi&#92;colon X_1,&#92;ldots,X_n&#92;to Y;" class="latex" /> we call such a morphism <i>n</i>-ary.</p>
<p>An early example, formulated operadically by Peter May (the inventor of operads) is called the <a href="//people.virginia.edu/~mah7cd/Foundations/May%20-%20Geometry%20of%20Iterated%20Loop%20Spaces.pdf">little 2-cubes operad</a>, denoted <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E_2.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="E_2." class="latex" /> It has only one object, say a square ⬜, and an <i>n</i>-ary morphism</p>
<p>⬜ ,&#8230;, ⬜ <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clongrightarrow&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;longrightarrow" class="latex" /> ⬜</p>
<p>is any arrangement of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" /> non-overlapping squares in a larger square. These arrangements clearly display a nesting property.</p>
<p>Another source of examples comes from the fact that every monoidal category <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28C%2C%5Cotimes%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(C,&#92;otimes)" class="latex" /> has an underlying operad <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D_C%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathcal{O}_C," class="latex" /> with</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BHom%7D_%7B%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D_C%7D%28X_1%2C%5Cldots%2CX_n%3BY%29%3A%3D%5Cmathrm%7BHom%7D_%7BC%7D%28X_1%5Cotimes%5Ccdots%5Cotimes+X_n%2CY%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{Hom}_{&#92;mathcal{O}_C}(X_1,&#92;ldots,X_n;Y):=&#92;mathrm{Hom}_{C}(X_1&#92;otimes&#92;cdots&#92;otimes X_n,Y) " class="latex" /></p>
<p>(Either <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C" class="latex" /> was symmetric monoidal to begin with or you can add in symmetries, roughly by multiplying each hom-set by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%21.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n!." class="latex" />) The operad <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbf%7BSet%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbf{Set}" class="latex" /> underlying the cartesian monoidal category <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5Cmathbf%7BSet%7D%2C%5Ctimes%2C%5C%7B1%5C%7D%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(&#92;mathbf{Set},&#92;times,&#92;{1&#92;})" class="latex" /> of sets is an example I’ll use later.</p>
<p>If you want to think about operads as modeling modularity—building one thing out of many—the first trick is to imagine the codomain object as the exterior and all the domain objects as sitting inside it, on the interior. May’s little 2-cubes operad gives the idea: squares <i>in</i> a square. From now on, if I speak of many little objects arranged inside one big object, I always mean it this way: the interior objects constitute the domain, the exterior object is the codomain, and the arrangement itself is the morphism. These arrangements can be nested inside one another, corresponding to composition in the operad.</p>
<p>What are other types of nested phenomena, which we might be able to think about operadically? How about <a href="//arxiv.org/abs/1305.0297">circles wired together in a larger circle</a>? An object in this operad is a circle with some number of wires sticking out; let’s call it a ported-circle. A morphism from <i>n</i>-many ported-circles to one ported-circle is any connection pattern involving—i.e., wiring together of—the ports. This description can be interpreted in a few different ways; I usually mean the underlying operad of the monoidal category of “sets and cospans under disjoint union”, but the <a href="//arxiv.org/pdf/0808.0764.pdf">“spaghetti and meatballs operad”</a> of circular planar arc diagrams is another good interpretation.</p>
<p>Once you have an operad <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathcal{O}," class="latex" /> you have a kind of calculus for nestable arrangements. As I’ve been saying, I often think of the morphisms in an operad in terms of pictures, such as wiring diagrams or squares-in-a-square. If you say you want these pictures to “mean something”, you’re probably looking for an algebra <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%3A%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D%5Cto%5Ctextbf%7BSets%7D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F:&#92;mathcal{O}&#92;to&#92;textbf{Sets}." class="latex" /> This operad functor <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F," class="latex" /> which acts like a lax functor between monoidal categories, would tell you the set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%28X%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F(X)" class="latex" /> of fillers or <b>fills</b> that can be placed into each object <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X%5Cin%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X&#92;in&#92;mathcal{O}" class="latex" /> in the picture.</p>
<p>I often think of the operad <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathcal{O}" class="latex" /> as a <i>picture language</i>, and the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathcal{O}" class="latex" />-algebra <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F" class="latex" /> its <i>intended semantics</i>. Not only does such a set-valued functor on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathcal{O}" class="latex" /> give you a set of fills for each object <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X%5Cin%5Cmathcal%7BO%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X&#92;in&#92;mathcal{O}" class="latex" />, it would also give you a formula for producing a large-scale fill (element of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%28Y%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F(Y)" class="latex" />) from any arrangement <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cvarphi%5Ccolon+X_1%2C%5Cldots%2CX_n%5Cto+Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;varphi&#92;colon X_1,&#92;ldots,X_n&#92;to Y" class="latex" /> of small-scale fills (element of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%28X_1%29%5Ctimes%5Ccdots%5Ctimes+F%28X_n%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F(X_1)&#92;times&#92;cdots&#92;times F(X_n)" class="latex" />).</p>
<p>For example, given a pointed space <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" />, you can ask for the set of based 2-spheres</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L_A%28&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="L_A(" class="latex" />⬜<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%29%3D%5C%7B%5Cell%5Ccolon+S%5E2%5Cto+A%5C%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt=")=&#92;{&#92;ell&#92;colon S^2&#92;to A&#92;}" class="latex" /></p>

Thus any “2-fold loop space” gives an algebra of May’s little 2-cubes operad.</p>
<p>So recently, I’ve been thinking a lot about operadic modularity, i.e., cases in which a thing can be built out of a bunch of simpler things. Note that not all cases of “nesting” have such a clear picture language. For example, <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus–Naur_Form#Example">context-free grammars</a> are modular: you build [postal-address] out of [name-part], [street-address] and [zip-part], you build each of these, e.g., [name-part], in any of several ways (there is an optional suffix part and the option to abbreviate your first name using an initial). The point is, you build things out of smaller parts, nested inside still smaller parts. Seeing context-free grammars as free operads is one of the things Hermida, Makkai, and Power explained in their paper on <a href="//dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=788906">higher dimensional multigraphs</a>.</p>
<p>The operadic notion of modularity can also be applied to building hierarchical protein materials. Like context-free grammars, the operad of such materials doesn’t come with a nice picture language. However, it can be formalized as an operad nonetheless. That is, there is a grammar of actions that one can apply to a bunch of polypeptides, actions such as “attach”, “overlay”, “rigidMotion”, “helix”, “makeArray”. From these you can build proteins that are quite complex from a simple vocabulary of 20 amino acids. I’ve joined forces with <a href="//scholar.google.com/citations?user=-38e7AwAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Tristan Giesa</a> and <a href="//2014davidsonfellows.com/ravi-jagadeesan">Ravi Jagadeesan</a> to make such a program. The software package, called <i>Matriarch</i>, for “Materi-als Arch-itecture”, should be <a href="//math.mit.edu/~dspivak/informatics/applied/matriarch/">available soon</a> as an open source Python library.</p>
<p>There are lots of operads whose morphisms look like string diagrams of various sorts. These operads, which generalize a set-theoretic version of May’s topological little 2-cubes, have clear picture languages. The algebras on such “visualizable” operads can model things like <a href="//arxiv.org/abs/1305.0297">databases</a> and <a href="//arxiv.org/abs/1408.1598">dynamical systems</a>. Over the past year or so, I’ve been writing a series of “worked example” papers, such as those above, in which I explain various picture languages and semantics for them.</p>
<p>I find that operads provide a nice language in which to discuss string diagrams of various sorts. String-diagrammatic languages exist for many different “doctrines”, such as categories, categories without identities, monoidal categories, cartesian monoidal categories, traced monoidal categories, operads, etc. For example, <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/drupel/"></a>Dylan Rupel and I realized that traced monoidal categories are (well, if you have enough <a href="//ncatlab.org/nlab/show/2-category+equipped+with+proarrows">equipment</a> and an expert like <a href="//math.mit.edu/directory/profile.php?pid=1619">Patrick Schultz</a> around) algebras on the operad of oriented 1-cobordisms. It seems to me that the other doctrines above are similarly associated to operads that are “nearby” Cob, e.g., sub-operads of Cob, operads under Cob, etc. Maps between these various operads should induce known adjunctions between the corresponding doctrines.</p>
<p>That brings us to present day.  There will be a workshop in Turin in a couple of months, and I think it’ll be a lot of fun:</p>
<p>&bull; Categorical Foundations of Network Theory, May 25-28, <a href="http://www.isi.it/about/">ISI Foundation</a>, Turin, Italy.</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to hearing from John Baez, Jacob Biamonte, Eugene Lerman, Tobias Fritz and others, about what they’ve been thinking about recently. I think we’ll find interesting common ground. If there’s interest, I’d be happy to talk about categorical models for how information is communicated throughout a network, and whether this gives any insight that can lead to better decision-making by the larger whole.</p>

<p>&bull; <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/03/27/spivak-part-1/">Part 1: The problem</a>.</p>
<h3>Creating a knowledge network</h3>
<p>In 2007, I asked myself: as mathematically as possible, what can formally ground meaningful information, including both its successful communication and its role in decision-making? I believed that category theory could be useful in formalizing the type of object that we call information, and the type of relationship that we call communication.</p>
<p>Over the next few years, I worked on this project. I tried to understand what information is, how it is stored, and how it can be transferred between entities that think differently. Since databases store information, I wanted to understand databases category-theoretically. I eventually decided that <a href="//vimeo.com/12428370">databases are basically just categories</a> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathcal{C}," class="latex" /> corresponding to a collection of meaningful concepts and connections between them, and that these categories are equipped with functors <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D%5Cto%5Cmathbf%7BSet%7D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathcal{C}&#92;to&#92;mathbf{Set}." class="latex" /> Such a functor assigns to each meaningful concept a set of examples and connects them as dictated by the morphisms of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbf%7BSet%7D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbf{Set}." class="latex" /> I later found out that this “databases as categories” idea was not original; it is due to <a href="//dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=770021">Rosebrugh and others</a>. My view on the subject has matured a bit since then, but I still like this basic conception of databases.</p>
<p>If we model a person’s knowledge as a database (interconnected tables of examples of things and relationships), then the network of knowledgeable humans could be conceptualized as a <a href="//arxiv.org/abs/0909.4314">simplicial complex equipped with a sheaf of databases</a>. Here, a vertex represents an individual, with her database of knowledge. An edge represents a pair of individuals and a <b>common ground</b> database relating their individual databases. For example, you and your brother have a database of concepts and examples from your history. The common-ground database is like the intersection of the two databases, but it could be smaller (if the people don’t yet know they agree on something). In a <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplicial_complex">simplicial complex</a>, there are not only vertices and edges, but also triangles (and so on). These would represent databases held in common between three or more people.</p>
<p>I wanted “regular people” to actually make such a knowledge network, i.e., to share their ideas in the form of categories and link them together with functors. Of course, most people don’t know categories and functors, so I thought I’d make things easier for them by equipping categories with linguistic structures: text boxes for objects, labeled arrows for morphisms. For example, “a person has a mother” would be a morphism from the “person” object, to the “mother” object. I called such a linguistic category an <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olog">olog</a>, playing on the word <i>blog</i>. The idea (originally inspired during a conversation with my friend Ralph Hutchison) was that I wanted people, especially scientists, to blog their ontologies, i.e., to write “onto-logs” like others make web-logs.</p>
<p>Ologs codify knowledge. They are like concept webs, except with more rules that allow them to simultaneously serve as database schemas. By introducing ologs, I hoped I could get real people to upload their ideas into what is now called the cloud, and make the necessary knowledge network. I tried to write my papers to engage an audience of intelligent lay-people rather than for an audience of mathematicians. It was a risk, but to me it was the only honest approach to the larger endeavor.</p>
<p>(For students who might want to try going out on a limb like this, you should know that I was offered zero jobs after my first postdoc at University of Oregon. The risk was indeed risky, and one has to be ok with that. I personally happened to be the beneficiary of good luck and was offered a grant, out of the clear blue sky, by a former PhD in algebraic geometry, who worked at the Office of Naval Research at the time. That, plus the helping hands of Haynes Miller and many other brilliant and wonderful people, can explain how I lived to tell the tale.)</p>
<p>So here’s how the simplicial complex of ologs would ideally help humanity steer. Suppose we say that in order for one person to learn from another, the two need to find a common language and align some ideas. This kind of (usually tacit) agreement on, or alignment of, an initial common-ground vocabulary and concept-set is important to get their communication onto a proper footing.</p>
<p>For two vertices in such a simplicial network, the richer their common-ground olog (i.e., the database corresponding to the edge between them) is, the more quickly and accurately the vertices can share new ideas. As ideas are shared over a simplex, all participating databases can be updated, hence making the communication between them richer. In around 2010, <a href="//thales.math.uqam.ca/~anelm/">Mathieu Anel</a> and I worked out a formal way this might occur; however, we have not yet written it up. The basic idea can be found <a href="//math.mit.edu/~dspivak/informatics/grants/AFOSR--Proposal.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>In this setup, the simplicial complex of human knowledge should grow organically. Scientists, business people, and other people might find benefit in ologging their ideas and conceptions, and using them to learn from their peers. I imagined a network organizing itself, where simplices of like-minded people could share information with neighboring groups across common faces.</p>
<p>I later wrote a book called <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/category-theory-sciences"><i>Category Theory for the Sciences</i></a>, available free online, to help scientists learn how category theory could apply to familiar situations like taxonomies, graphs, and symmetries. Category theory, simply explained, becomes a wonderful key to the whole world of pure mathematics. It’s the closest thing we have to a universal language of thought, and therefore an appropriate language for forming connections.</p>
<p>My working hypothesis for the knowledge network was this. The information held by people whose worldview is more true—more accurate—would have better predictive power, i.e., better results. This is by definition: I define ones knowledge to be <i>accurate</i> as the extent to which, when he uses this knowledge to direct his actions, he has good luck handling his worldly affairs. As Louis Pasteur said, “Luck favors the prepared mind.” It follows that if someone has a track record of success, others will value finding broad connections into his olog. However, to link up with someone you must find a part of your olog that aligns with his—a functorial connection—and you can only receive meaningful information from him to the extent that you’ve found such common ground.</p>
<p>Thus, people who like to live in fiction worlds would find it difficult to connect, except to other like-minded “Obama’s a Christian”-type people. To the extent you are imbedded in a fictional—less accurate, less predictive—part of the network, you will find it difficult to establish <i>functorial</i> connections to regions of more accurate knowledge, and therefore you can’t benefit from the predictive and conceptual value of this knowledge.</p>
<p>In other words, people would be naturally inclined to try to align their understanding with people that are better informed. I felt hope that this kind of idea could lead to a system in which honesty and accuracy were naturally rewarded. At the very least, those who used it could share information much more effectively than they do now. This was my plan; I just had to make it real.</p>
<p>I had a fun idea for publicizing ologs. The year was in 2008, and I remember thinking it would be fantastic if I could olog the political platform and worldview of Barack Obama and of Sarah Palin. I wished I could sit down with them and other politicians and help them write ologs about what they believed and wanted for the country. I imagined that some politicians might have ologs that look like a bunch of disconnected text boxes—like a brain with neurons but no synapses—a collection of talking points but no real substantive ideas.</p>
<p>Anyway, there I was, trying to understand everything this way: all information was categories (or perhaps <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketch_(mathematics)">sketches</a>) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presheaf_%28category_theory%29">presheaves</a>. I would work with interested people from any academic discipline, such as <a href="//journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0023911">materials science</a>, to make ologs about whatever information they wanted to record category-theoretically. Ologs weren’t a theory of everything, but instead, as Jack Morava put it, <a href="//arxiv.org/abs/1202.0684">a theory of anything</a>.</p>
<p>One day I was working on a categorical sketch to model processes within processes, but somehow it really wasn’t working properly. The idea was simple: each step in a recipe is a mini-recipe of its own. Like chopping the carrots means getting out a knife and cutting board, putting a carrot on there, and bringing the knife down successively along it. You can keep zooming into any of these and see it as its own process. So there is some kind of nested, fractal-like behavior here. The olog I made could model the idea of steps in a recipe, but I found it difficult to encode the fact that each step was itself a recipe.</p>
<p>This nesting thing seemed like an idea that mathematics should treat beautifully, and ologs weren’t doing it justice. It was then when I finally admitted that there might be other fish in the mathematical sea.</p>

					<p><i>guest post by <a href="http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/"><b>David Spivak</b></a></i></p>
<h3> The problem </h3>
<p>The idea that’s haunted me, and motivated me, for the past seven years or so came to me while reading a book called <i><a href="http://press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/791173.html">The Moment of Complexity: our Emerging Network Culture</a></i>, by Mark C. Taylor. It was a fascinating book about how our world is becoming increasingly networked—wired up and connected—and that this is leading to a dramatic increase in complexity. I’m not sure if it was stated explicitly there, but I got the idea that with the advent of the World Wide Web in 1991, a new neural network had been born. The lights had been turned on, and planet earth now had a brain.</p>
<p>I wondered how far this idea could be pushed. Is the world alive, is it a single living thing? If it is, in the sense I meant, then its primary job is to survive, and to survive it’ll have to make decisions. So there I was in my living room thinking, “oh my god, we’ve got to steer this thing!”</p>
<p>Taylor pointed out that as complexity increases, it’ll become harder to make sense of what’s going on in the world. That seemed to me like a big problem on the horizon, because in order to make good decisions, we need to have a good grasp on what’s occurring. I became obsessed with the idea of helping my species through this time of unprecedented complexity. I wanted to understand what was needed in order to help humanity make good decisions.</p>
<p>What seemed important as a first step is that we humans need to unify our understanding—to come to agreement—on matters of fact. For example, humanity still doesn’t know whether global warming is happening. Sure almost all credible scientists have agreed that it is happening, but does that steer money into programs that will slow it or mitigate its effects? This isn’t an issue of what course to take to solve a given problem; it’s about whether the problem even exists! It’s like when people were talking about Obama being a Muslim, born in Kenya, etc., and some people were denying it, saying he was born in Hawaii. If that’s true, why did he repeatedly refuse to show his birth certificate?</p>
<p>It is important, as a first step, to improve the extent to which we agree on the most obvious facts. This kind of “sanity check” is a necessary foundation for discussions about what course we should take. If we want to steer the ship, we have to make committed choices, like “we’re turning left now,” and we need to do so as a group. That is, there needs to be some amount of agreement about the way we should steer, so we’re not fighting ourselves.</p>
<p>Luckily there are a many cases of a group that needs to, and is able to, steer itself as a whole. For example as a human, my neural brain works with my cells to steer my body. Similarly, corporations steer themselves based on boards of directors, and based on flows of information, which run bureaucratically and/or informally between different parts of the company. Note that in neither case is there any suggestion that each part—cell, employee, or corporate entity—is “rational”; they’re all just doing their thing. What we do see in these cases is that the group members work together in a context where information and internal agreement is valued and often attained.</p>
<p>It seemed to me that intelligent, group-directed steering is possible. It does occur. But what’s the mechanism by which it happens, and how can we think about it? I figured that the way we steer, i.e., make decisions, is by using information.</p>
<p>I should be clear: whenever I say information, I never mean it “in the sense of Claude Shannon”. As beautiful as Shannon’s notion of information is, he’s not talking about the kind of information I mean. He explicitly said in <a href="//cm.bell-labs.com/cm/ms/what/shannonday/shannon1948.pdf">his seminal paper</a> that information in his sense is not concerned with <i>meaning</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer to or are correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptual entities. These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem. The significant aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible messages.
</p></blockquote>
<p>In contrast, I’m interested in the semantic stuff, which flows between humans, and which makes possible decisions about things like climate change. Shannon invented a very useful <i>quantitative measure</i> of meaningless probability distributions.</p>
<p>That’s not the kind of information I’m talking about. When I say “I want to know what information is”, I’m saying I want to formulate the notion of human-usable semantic meaning, in as mathematical a way as possible.</p>
<p>Back to my problem: we need to steer the ship, and to do so we need to use information properly. Unfortunately, I had no idea what information is, nor how it’s used to make decisions (let alone to make good ones), nor how it’s obtained from our interaction with the world. Moreover, I didn’t have a clue how the minute information-handling at the micro-level, e.g., done by cells inside a body or employees inside a corporation, would yield information-handling at the macro (body or corporate) level.</p>
<p>I set out to try to understand what information <i>is</i> and how it can be communicated. What kind of stuff is information? It seems to follow rules: facts can be put together to form new facts, but only in certain ways. I was once explaining this idea to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kan">Dan Kan</a>, and he agreed saying, “Yes, information is inherently a combinatorial affair.” What is the combinatorics of information?</p>
<p>Communication is similarly difficult to understand, once you dig into it. For example, my brain somehow enables me to use information and so does yours. But our brains are wired up in personal and <i>ad hoc</i> ways, when you look closely, a bit like a fingerprint or retinal scan. I found it fascinating that two highly personalized semantic networks could interface well enough to effectively collaborate.</p>
<p>There are two issues that I wanted to understand, and by to <i>understand</i> I mean to make mathematical to my own satisfaction. The first is what information <i>is</i>, as structured stuff, and what communication <i>is</i>, as a transfer of structured stuff. The second is how communication at micro-levels can create, or be, understanding at macro-levels, i.e., how a group can steer as a singleton.</p>
<p>Looking back on this endeavor now, I remain concerned. Things are getting increasingly complex, in the sorts of ways predicted by Mark C. Taylor in his book, and we seem to be losing some control: of the NSA, of privacy, of people 3D printing guns or germs, of drones, of big financial institutions, etc.</p>
<p>Can we expect or hope that our species as a whole will make decisions that are healthy, like keeping the temperature down, given the information we have available? Are we in the driver’s seat, or is our ship currently in the process of spiraling out of our control?</p>
<p>Let’s assume that we don’t want to panic but that we do want to participate in helping the human community to make appropriate decisions. A possible first step could be to formalize the notion of “using information well”. If we could do this rigorously, it would go a long way toward helping humanity get onto a healthy course. Further, mathematics is one of humanity’s best inventions. Using this tool to improve our ability to use information properly is a non-partisan approach to addressing the issue. It’s not about fighting, it’s about figuring out what’s happening, and weighing all our options in an informed way.</p>
<p>So, I ask: What kind of mathematics might serve as a formal ground for the notion of meaningful information, including both its successful communication and its role in decision-making?</p>
