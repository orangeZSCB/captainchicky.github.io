<p>We&#8217;ll start with some finite set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> of &#8216;events&#8217;.  The idea is that these are things that can happen&#8212;for example, choices you could make while playing a game.   We assume that if one of these outcomes happens, the others don&#8217;t.   A &#8216;probability distribution&#8217; on this set assigns to each event a number called a &#8216;probability&#8217;&#8212;which says, roughly speaking, how likely that event is.  If we&#8217;ve got some event <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i," class="latex" /> we&#8217;ll call its probability <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_i.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p_i." class="latex" /></p>
<p>For example, suppose we&#8217;re interested in whether it will rain today or not.  Then we might look at a set of two events:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X+%3D+%5C%7B%5Ctextrm%7Brain%7D%2C+%5Ctextrm%7Bno+rain%7D+%5C%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X = &#92;{&#92;textrm{rain}, &#92;textrm{no rain} &#92;}" class="latex" />
</div>
<p>If the weatherman says the chance of rain is 20%, then</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_%7B%5Ctextrm%7Brain%7D+%7D+%3D+0.2+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p_{&#92;textrm{rain} } = 0.2 " class="latex" />
</div>
<p>since 20% is just a fancy way of saying 0.2.  The chance of no rain will then be 80%, or 0.8, since the probabilities should add up to 1:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_%7B%5Ctextrm%7Bno+rain%7D%7D+%3D+0.8+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p_{&#92;textrm{no rain}} = 0.8 " class="latex" />
</div>
<p>Let&#8217;s make this precise with an official definition:</p>
<p><b>Definition.</b> Given a finite set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> of <b>events</b>, a <b>probability distribution</b> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p" class="latex" /> assigns a real number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p_i" class="latex" /> called a <b>probability</b> to each event <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i+%5Cin+X%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i &#92;in X," class="latex" /> such that:</p>
<p>1) <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0+%5Cle+p_i+%5Cle+1+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="0 &#92;le p_i &#92;le 1 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>and</p>
<p>2) <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Csum_%7Bi+%5Cin+X%7D+p_i+%3D+1%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;sum_{i &#92;in X} p_i = 1} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Note that this official definition doesn&#8217;t say what an event <i>really is</i>, and it doesn&#8217;t say what probabilities <i>really mean</i>.  But that&#8217;s how it should be!  As usual with math definitions, the words in boldface could be replaced by <i>any other words</i> and the definition would still do its main job, which is to let us prove theorems involving these words.  If we wanted, we could call an event a <b>doohickey</b>, and call a probability a <b>schnoofus</b>.  All our theorems would still be true.</p>
<p>Of course we hope our theorems will be useful in real world applications.  And in these applications, the probabilities <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p_i" class="latex" /> will be some way of measuring &#8216;how likely&#8217; events are.  But it&#8217;s actually quite hard to say precisely what probabilities really mean!   People have been arguing about this for centuries.  So it&#8217;s good that we separate this hard task from our definition above, which is quite simple and 100% precise.</p>
<p>Why is it hard to say what probabilities really are?  Well, what does it mean to say &#8220;the probability of rain is 20%&#8221;?  Suppose you see a weather report and read this.  What does it mean?</p>
<p>A student suggests: &#8220;it means that if you looked at a lot of similar days, it would rain on 20% of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, that&#8217;s pretty good.  But what counts as a &#8220;similar day&#8221;?  How similar does it have to be?  Does everyone have to wear the same clothes?  No, that probably doesn&#8217;t matter, because presumably doesn&#8217;t affect the weather.   But what <i>does</i> affect the weather?  A lot of things!  Do <i>all</i> those things have to be exactly the same for it count as similar day.</p>
<p>And what counts as a &#8220;lot&#8221; of days?  How many do we need?</p>
<p>And it won&#8217;t rain on <i>exactly</i> 20% of those days.  How close do we need to get?</p>
<p>Imagine I have a coin and I claim it lands heads up 50% of the time.  Say I flip it 10 times and it lands heads up every time.  Does that mean I was wrong?  Not necessarily.  It&#8217;s <i>possible</i> that the coin will do this.  It&#8217;s just not very <i>probable</i>.</p>
<p>But look: now we&#8217;re using the word &#8216;probable&#8217;, which is the word we&#8217;re trying to understand!  It&#8217;s getting sort of circular: we&#8217;re saying a coin has a 50% probability of landing heads up if when you flip it a lot of times, it <i>probably</i> lands head up close to 50% of the time.  That&#8217;s not very helpful if you don&#8217;t already have some idea what &#8216;probability&#8217; means.</p>
<p>For all these reasons, and many more, it&#8217;s tricky to say exactly what probabilities really mean.  People have made a lot of progress on this question, but we will sidestep it and focus on learning to calculate with probabilities.</p>

<h3> Equally likely events </h3>
<p>As I&#8217;ve tried to convince you, it can be hard to figure out the probabilities of events.  But it&#8217;s easy if we assume all the events are equally likely.</p>
<p>Suppose we have a set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> consisting of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" /> events.  And suppose that all the probabilities <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p_i" class="latex" /> are equal: say for some constant <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c" class="latex" /> we have</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_i+%3D+c+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p_i = c " class="latex" />
</div>
<p>for all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i+%5Cin+X.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i &#92;in X." class="latex" />  Then by rule 1) above,</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+1+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bi+%5Cin+X%7D+p_i+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bi+%5Cin+X%7D+c+%3D+n+c+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ 1 = &#92;sum_{i &#92;in X} p_i = &#92;sum_{i &#92;in X} c = n c } " class="latex" />
</div>
<p>since we&#8217;re just adding the number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c" class="latex" /> to itself <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" /> times.  So,</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B++c+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%7D+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{  c = &#92;frac{1}{n} } " class="latex" />
</div>
<p>and thus</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+p_i+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%7D+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ p_i = &#92;frac{1}{n} } " class="latex" />
</div>
<p>for all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i+%5Cin+X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i &#92;in X" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>I made this look harder than it really is. I was just trying to show you that it follows from the definitions, not any intuition.  But it&#8217;s obvious: if you have <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" /> events that are equally likely, each one has probability <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2Fn.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="1/n." class="latex" /></p>
<p><b>Example 1.</b>  Suppose we have a coin that can land either heads up or tails up&#8212;let&#8217;s ignore the possibility that it lands on its edge!  Then</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X+%3D+%5C%7B+H%2C+T%5C%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X = &#92;{ H, T&#92;}" class="latex" />
</div>
<p>If we assume these two events are equally probable, we must have</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+p_H+%3D+p_T+%3D++%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ p_H = p_T =  &#92;frac{1}{2} } " class="latex" />
</div>
<p>Note I said <i>&#8220;if we assume&#8221;</i> these two events are equally probable.  I didn&#8217;t say they actually are!  Are they?  Suppose we take a penny and flip it a zillion times.  Will it land heads up almost exactly half a zillion times?</p>
<p>Probably not!  The treasury isn&#8217;t interested in making pennies that do this.  They&#8217;re interested in making the head look like Lincoln, and the tail look like the Lincoln national monument:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_%28United_States_coin%29"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/2010_cent_obverse.png/250px-2010_cent_obverse.png" /></a></div>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_%28United_States_coin%29"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/2005_Penny_Rev_Unc_D.png/250px-2005_Penny_Rev_Unc_D.png" /></a></div>
<p>Or at least they used to.  Since the two sides are different, there&#8217;s no reason they should have the exact same probability of landing on top.</p>
<p>In fact nobody seems to have measured the difference between heads and tails in probabilities for <i>flipping</i> pennies.  For hand-flipped pennies, it seems whatever side that starts on top has a roughly 51% chance of landing on top!  But if you <i>spin</i> a penny, it&#8217;s much more likely to land tails up:</p>

<p><b>Example 2.</b>  Suppose we have a standard deck of cards, well-shuffled, and assume that when I draw a card from this deck, each card is equally likely to be chosen. What is the probability that I draw the ace of spades?</p>
<p>If there&#8217;s no joker in the deck, there are 52 cards, so the answer is 1/52.</p>
<p>Let me remind you how a deck of cards works: I wouldn&#8217;t want someone to fail the course because they didn&#8217;t ever play cards!   Here are the 52 cards in a standard deck.  Here&#8217;s what they all look like (click to enlarge):</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/cards.png"><img width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/cards.png" /></a></div>
<p>As you can see, they come in 4 kinds, called <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suit_%28cards%29">suits</a></b>.  The suits are:</p>
<p>&bull; clubs: ♣</p>
<p>&bull; spades: ♠</p>
<p>&bull; <font color="red">diamonds: ♦</font></p>
<p>&bull; <font color="red">hearts: ♥</font></p>
<p>Two suits are black and two are red.  Each suit has 13 cards in it, for a total of 4 &times; 13 = 52. The cards in each suit are numbered from 1 to 13, except for four exceptions.  They go like this:</p>
<div align="center">
A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K
</div>
<p>A stands for &#8216;ace&#8217;, J for &#8216;jack&#8217;, Q for &#8216;queen&#8217; and K for &#8216;king&#8217;.</p>
<h3> Probabilities of subsets </h3>
<p>If we know a probability distribution on a finite set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" />, we can define the probability that an event in some subset <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S+%5Csubseteq+X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S &#92;subseteq X" class="latex" /> will occur.  We define this to be</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7Bp%28S%29+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bi+%5Cin+S%7D+p_i+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{p(S) = &#92;sum_{i &#92;in S} p_i } " class="latex" />
</div>
<p>For example, suppose I always have one of three things for breakfast:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X+%3D+%5C%7B+%5Ctextrm%7Boatmeal%7D%2C+%5Ctextrm%7Bwaffles%7D%2C+%5Ctextrm%7Beggs%7D+%5C%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X = &#92;{ &#92;textrm{oatmeal}, &#92;textrm{waffles}, &#92;textrm{eggs} &#92;} " class="latex" />
</div>
<p>This is my set of outcomes.  If I eat one of these things, I don&#8217;t eat the others, so the probabilities of these different outcomes should add up to 1.</p>
<p>Suppose I have an 86% chance of eating oatmeal for breakfast, a 10% chance of eating waffles, and a 4% chance of eating eggs and toast.  What&#8217;s the probability that I will eat oatmeal <i>or</i> waffles?  These choices form the subset</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S+%3D+%5C%7B+%5Ctextrm%7Boatmeal%7D%2C+%5Ctextrm%7Bwaffles%7D+%5C%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S = &#92;{ &#92;textrm{oatmeal}, &#92;textrm{waffles} &#92;} " class="latex" />
</div>
<p>and the probability for this subset is</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%28S%29+%3D+p_%7B%5Ctextrm%7Boatmeal%7D%7D+%2B+p_%7B%5Ctextrm%7Bwaffles%7D%7D+%3D+0.86+%2B+0.1+%3D+0.96+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p(S) = p_{&#92;textrm{oatmeal}} + p_{&#92;textrm{waffles}} = 0.86 + 0.1 = 0.96 " class="latex" />
</div>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example from cards:</p>
<p><b>Example 2.</b>  Suppose we have a standard deck of cards, well-shuffled, and assume that when I draw a card from this deck, each card is equally likely to be chosen. What is the probability that I draw a card in the suit of hearts?</p>
<p>Since there are 13 cards in the suit of hearts, each with probability 1/52, we add up their probabilities and get</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+13+%5Ctimes+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B52%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B4%7D+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ 13 &#92;times &#92;frac{1}{52} = &#92;frac{1}{4} }" class="latex" />
</div>
<p>This should make sense, since there are 4 suits, and as many cards in each suit.</p>
<h3> Card tricks </h3>
<p>This is just a fun digression.  The deck of cards involves some weird numerology.  For starters, it has 52 cards.  That&#8217;s a strange number!  Where else have you seen this number?</p>
<p>A student says: &#8220;It&#8217;s the number of weeks in a year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Right!  And these 52 cards are grouped in 4 suits.  What does the year have 4 of?</p>
<p>A student says: &#8220;Seasons!&#8221;</p>
<p>Right!  And we have 52 = 4 &times; 13.  So what are there 13 of?</p>
<p>A student says: &#8220;Weeks in a season!&#8221;</p>
<p>Right!  I have no idea if this is a coincidence or not.  And have you ever added up the values of all the cards in a suit, where we count the ace as 1, and so on?  We get</p>
<div align="center">
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 + 13
</div>
<p>And what&#8217;s that equal to?</p>
<p>After a long pause, a student says &#8220;91.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, that&#8217;s a <i>really</i> strange number.  But let&#8217;s say we total up the values of all the cards in the deck, not just one suit.  What do we get?</p>
<p>A student says &#8220;We get 4 &times; 91&#8230; or 364.&#8221;</p>
<p>Right.  Three-hundred and sixty-<i>four</i>.  <i>Almost</i> the number of days in year.</p>
<p>&#8220;So add one more: the joker!  Then you get 365!&#8221;</p>
<p>Right, maybe that&#8217;s why they put an extra card called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_%28playing_card%29"><b>joker</b></a> in the deck:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_%28playing_card%29"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Joker_black_02.svg/200px-Joker_black_02.svg.png" /></a></div>
<p>One extra card for one extra day, joker-day&#8230; April Fool&#8217;s Day!  That brings the total up to 365.</p>
<p>Again, I have no idea if this is a coincidence or not. But the people who invented the Tarot deck were pretty weird&mdash;they packed it with symbolism&mdash;so maybe the ordinary cards were designed this way on purpose too.</p>
<p><b>Puzzle.</b>  What are the prime factors of the number 91?  You should know by now&#8230; and you should know what they have to do with the calendar!</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>We&#8217;ve been looking at games where each player gets a payoff depending on the choice that both players make.  The payoff is a real number, which I often call the number of <b>points</b>.  When we play these games in class, these points go toward your grade.  10% of your grade depends on the the total number of points you earn in quizzes and games.  But what do these points mean in other games, like Prisoner&#8217;s Dilemma or Battle of the Sexes?</p>
<p>This leads us into some very interesting and deep questions.   Let&#8217;s take a <i>very</i> quick look at them, without getting very dep.</p>
<h3> Maximizing the payoff </h3>
<p>The main thing is this.  When we&#8217;re studying games, we&#8217;ll assume <i>each player&#8217;s goal is to earn as many points as possible.</i>  In other words, they are trying to maximize their payoff.</p>
<p>They are <i>not</i>, for example, trying to make their payoff bigger than the other player&#8217;s payoff.  Indeed, in class you should <i>not</i> be trying to earn more points than me!  One student said he was trying to do that.  That&#8217;s a mistake.  You should be happier if </p>
<p>&bull; you get 10 points and I get 20</p>
<p>than if</p>
<p>&bull; you get -10 points and I get -20.</p>
<p>After all, it&#8217;s only <i>your total number of points</i> that affects your grade, not whether it&#8217;s bigger than mine.  </p>
<p>So, you should always try to maximize your payoff.  And I promise to do the same thing: I&#8217;ll always try to maximize my payoff.  You have to take my word on this, since my salary is not affected by my payoff!  But I want to make your task very clear: you are trying to maximize your payoff, and <i>you can assume I am trying to maximize mine.</i>   </p>
<p>(If I were doing something else, like sadistically trying to minimize your payoff, that would affect your decisions!)</p>
<h3> Rational agents and utility </h3>
<p>We can&#8217;t understand how people actually play games unless we know what they are trying to do.  In real life, people&#8217;s motives are very complicated and sometimes mysterious.  But in mathematical game theory, we start by studying simpler: <b>rational agents</b>.  Roughly speaking, a rational agent is defined to be a person or animal or computer program or something that is <i>doing the best possible job of maximizing some quantity, given the information they have</i>.  </p>
<p>This is a rough definition, which we will try to improve later.  </p>
<p>You shouldn&#8217;t be fooled by the positive connotations of the word &#8216;rational&#8217;.  We&#8217;re using it in a very specific technical way here.  A madman in a movie theater who is trying to kill as many people as possible counts as &#8216;rational&#8217; by our definition if they <i>maximize the number of people killed, given the information they have.</i>  </p>
<p>The whole question of what really <i>should</i> count as &#8216;rationality&#8217; is a very deep one.  People have a lot of interesting ideas about it:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationality">Rationality</a>, Wikipedia.</p>
<h3> Utility </h3>
<p>So: we say a rational agent does the best possible job of maximizing their payoff given the information they have.  But in economics, this payoff is often called <b>utility</b>.  </p>
<p>That&#8217;s an odd word, but comes from a moral philosophy called <b>utilitarianism</b>, which says&mdash;very roughly&mdash;that the goal of life is to maximize happiness.   Perhaps because it&#8217;s a bit embarrassing to talk about maximizing happiness, these philosophers called it &#8216;utility&#8217;.</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/smiley_face.gif" /></div>
<p>But be careful: while the moral philosophers often talk about agents trying to maximize <i>the total utility of everyone,</i> economists focus on rational agents trying to maximize their <i>own</i> utility.  </p>
<p>This sounds very selfish.  But it&#8217;s not necessarily.  If you want other people to be happy, your utility depends on their utility.  If you were a complete altruist, perhaps maximizing your utility would even be <i>the same</i> as maximizing the total utility of everyone!</p>
<p>Again, there are many deep problems here, which I won&#8217;t discuss.  I&#8217;ll just mention one: in practice, it&#8217;s very hard to define utility in a way that&#8217;s precise enough to measure, much less add up!  See here for a bit more:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility">Utility</a>, Wikipedia.</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism">Utilitarianism</a>, Wikipedia.</p>
<h3> The assumption of mutual rationality </h3>
<p>Game theory is simplest when</p>
<p>&bull; <i>all players are rational agents</i>, </p>
<p>and </p>
<p>&bull; <i>each player knows all the other players are rational agents</i>.</p>
<p>Of course, in the real world nobody is rational all the time, so things get much more complicated.  If you&#8217;re playing against an irrational agent, you have to work harder to guess what they are going to do!</p>
<p>But in the games we play in class, I will try to be a rational agent: I will try my best to maximize my payoff.  And you too should try to be a rational agent, and maximize your payoff&mdash;since that will help your grade.  And you can assume I am a rational agent.  And I will assume you are a rational agent.  </p>
<p>So: I know that if I keep making the same choice, you will make the choice that maximizes your payoff given what I do.  </p>
<p>And: you know that if you keep making the same choice, I will make the choice that maximizes my payoff given what you do.</p>
<p>Given this, we should both seek a Nash equilibrium.  I won&#8217;t try to state this precisely and prove it as a theorem&#8230; but I hope it&#8217;s believable.   You can see some theorems about this here:</p>
<p>&bull; Robert Aumann and Adam Brandenburger, <a href="http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~abranden/ecne-10-03-06.pdf">Epistemic conditions for Nash equilibrium</a>.</p>
<h3> Probabilities </h3>
<p>All this is fine if a Nash equilibrium exists and is unique.  But we&#8217;ve seen that in some games, a Nash equilibirum doesn&#8217;t exist&#8212;at least not, if we only consider <b>pure strategies</b>, where each player makes the same choice every time.  And in other games, the Nash equilibrium exists but there is more than one.  </p>
<p>In games like this, saying that players will try to find a Nash equilibrium doesn&#8217;t settle all our questions!  What should they do if there&#8217;s none, or more than one?</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve seen one example: rock-paper-scissors.  If we only consider pure strategies, this game has no Nash equilibrium.  But I&#8217;ve already suggested the solution to this problem.  The players should use <b>mixed strategies</b>, where they randomly make different choices with different probabilities.  </p>
<p>So, to make progress, we&#8217;ll need to learn a bit of probability theory!  That&#8217;ll be our next topic.</p>

					<p>Here are a bunch of puzzles about game theory, to see if you understand the material so far.</p>
<h3> Classifying games </h3>
<p>For each of the following games, say whether it is:</p>

<h3> Battle of the Sexes</h3>
<p>Suppose that Alice and Bob are going to the movies.  Alice wants to see the movie <i>This is 40</i> while Bob wants to see <i>Zero Dark Thirty</i>.  Let&#8217;s say Alice and Bob each have two strategies:</p>
<p><b>1.</b>  Watch the movie they really want to see.<br />
<b>2.</b>  Watch the movie the <i>other</i> one wants to see.</p>
<p>If they both watch the movie they really want, each goes out alone and gets a payoff of 5.  If they both watch the movie the <i>other</i> wants to see, they again go out alone and now each gets a payoff of -5, because they&#8217;re both really bored as well as lonely.  Finally, suppose one watches the movie they want while the other kindly  watches the movie their partner wants.  Then they go out together.  The one who gets to see the movie they want gets a payoff of 10, while the one who doesn&#8217;t gets a payoff of 7.   (They may not like the movie, but they get &#8216;points&#8217; for being a good partner!)</p>
<p>Call Alice <b>A</b> for short, and call Bob <b><font color="red"><b>B</b></font></b>.   Write down this game in normal form.</p>
<h3> Prisoner&#8217;s Dilemma</h3>
<p>Now suppose Alice and Bob have been arrested because they&#8217;re suspected of having conspired to commit a serious crime: an armed robbery of the movie theater!  </p>
<p>They are interrogated in separate rooms.  The detectives explain to each of them that they are looking at 3 years of jail even if neither of them confess.  If one  confesses and the other denies having committed the crime, the one who confesses will get only 1 year of jail, while the one who denies it will get 25 years.  If they both confess, they will both get 10 years of jail.</p>
<p>Suppose the two strategies available to both of them are:</p>
<p><b>1.</b> confess to the crime.<br />
<b>2.</b> deny having done it.</p>
<p>Write down this game in normal form, where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" /> years of jail time counts as a payoff of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=-n.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="-n." class="latex" /> </p>
<h3> Game theory concepts </h3>
<p>Now, for both the Battle of the Sexes and Prisoner&#8217;s Dilemma games, answer these questions:</p>
<p>a) Is this a <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2013/01/06/game-theory-part-1/">zero-sum</a> game?</p>
<p>b) Is this a <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2013/01/06/game-theory-part-1/">symmetric</a> game?</p>
<p>c) Does player A have a <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2013/01/18/game-theory-part-4/">strictly dominant</a> pure strategy?  If so, which one?</p>
<p>d) Does player B have a strictly dominant pure strategy?  If so, which one?</p>
<p>e) Does this game have one or more <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2013/01/17/game-theory-part-3/">Nash equilibria</a>?  If so, what are they?</p>
<h3> Zero-sum and symmetric games </h3>
<p>For the next two problems, suppose we have a game in normal form described by two <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m+%5Ctimes+n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="m &#92;times n" class="latex" /> matrices <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B." class="latex" />  Remember from <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2013/01/13/game-theory-part-2/">Part 2</a> of our course notes that if player A chooses strategy <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i" class="latex" /> and player B chooses strategy <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="j" class="latex" />, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A_%7Bij%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A_{ij}" class="latex" /> is the payoff to player A and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B_%7Bij%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B_{ij}" class="latex" /> is the payoff to player B.</p>
<p>a) What conditions on the matrices <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B" class="latex" /> say that this game is a zero-sum game?</p>
<p>b)  What conditions on the matrices <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B" class="latex" /> say that the game is symmetric?</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2013/01/17/game-theory-part-3/">Last time</a> we talked about Nash equilibria for a 2-player normal form game.   We saw that sometimes a Nash equilibrium doesn&#8217;t exist!  Sometimes there&#8217;s more than one!  But suppose there is at least one Nash equilibrium.  How do we find one?  Sometimes it&#8217;s hard. </p>
<h3> Strict domination </h3>
<p>But there&#8217;s a simple trick to rule out some possibilities.  Sometimes player A will have a choice <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i" class="latex" /> that gives them a bigger payoff than some choice <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i%27&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i&#039;" class="latex" /> no matter what choice player B makes.   In this case we say choice <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i" class="latex" /> <b>strictly dominates</b> choice <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i%27.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i&#039;." class="latex" />  And in this case, there&#8217;s no way that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i%27&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i&#039;" class="latex" /> could be A&#8217;s choice in a Nash equilibrium, because player A can always improve their payoff by switching to choice <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i." class="latex" /></p>
<p>For example, look at this game:</p>
<div align="center">
<table border="0">
<tr>
<td></td>
<td align="center"><font color="red"><b>1</b></font></td>
<td align="center"><font color="red"><b>2</b></font></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>1 &nbsp;&nbsp;</b></td>
<td align="center">(0,<font color="red">0</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align="center">(-1,<font color="red">1</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>2</b></td>
<td align="center">(2,<font color="red">-1</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align="center">(0,<font color="red">0</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>3</b></td>
<td align="center">(-2,<font color="red">1</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align="center">(1,<font color="red">-1</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>4</b></td>
<td align="center">(0,<font color="red">1</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align="center">(2,<font color="red">0</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>For player A, choice 4 strictly dominates choice 3.  No matter what player B does, player A gets a bigger payoff if they make choice 4 than if they make choice 3.   Stare at the black numbers in the table in rows 3 and 4 until you see this.</p>
<p>You can also see it using the payoff matrix for player A:</p>

<p><b>Puzzle.</b>  Are there any other examples of a choice for player A that strictly dominates another choice?  </p>
<p>And of course the same sort of thing works for player B.

<h3> Strict dominance </h3>
<p><b>Definition.</b>  We say a choice is <b>strictly dominant</b> if it strictly dominates all other choices for that player.  </p>
<p>Let me remind you again that a <b>pure strategy</b> is a way for one player to play a game where they always make the same choice.  So, there is one pure strategy for each choice, and one choice for each pure strategy.  This means we can be a bit relaxed about the difference between these words.  So, what we&#8217;re calling strictly dominant choices, most people call strictly dominant <i>pure strategies</i>.  You can read more about these ideas here:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_dominance">Strategic dominance</a>, Wikipedia.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve seen that if one choice strictly dominates another, that other choice can&#8217;t be part of a Nash equilibrium.  So if one choices strictly dominates <i>all</i> others, that choice is the <i>only</i> one that can be part of a Nash equilibrium!  In other words:</p>
<p><b>Theorem 2.</b> If a choice <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i" class="latex" /> for player A is strictly dominant, then any Nash equilibrium <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28i%27%2Cj%27%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(i&#039;,j&#039;)" class="latex" /> must have <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i%27+%3D+i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i&#039; = i" class="latex" />.  Similarly, if a choice <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="j" class="latex" /> for player B is strictly dominant, then any Nash equilibrium <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28i%27%2Cj%27%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(i&#039;,j&#039;)" class="latex" /> must have <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j%27+%3D+j&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="j&#039; = j" class="latex" />. </p>
<p><b>Proof.</b> We&#8217;ll only prove the first statement since the second one works the exact same way.    Theorem 1 says that if a choice <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i" class="latex" /> for player A strictly dominates a choice <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i%27%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i&#039;," class="latex" /> then no choice <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="j" class="latex" /> for player B gives a Nash equilibrium <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28i%27%2Cj%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(i&#039;,j)." class="latex" />   So, if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i" class="latex" /> strictly dominates all <i>other</i> choices for player A, it is impossible to have a Nash equilibrium <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28i%27%2Cj%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(i&#039;,j)" class="latex" /> unless <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i%27+%3D+i.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i&#039; = i." class="latex" />   &#9608;</p>
<p>We can go even further:</p>
<p><b>Theorem 3.</b> If choice <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i" class="latex" /> for player A is strictly dominant and choice <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="j" class="latex" /> for player B is strictly dominant, then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28i%2C+j%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(i, j)" class="latex" /> is a Nash equilibrium, and there is no other Nash equilibrium.</p>
<p><b>Proof.</b>  Suppose choice <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i" class="latex" /> for player A is strictly dominant and choice <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="j" class="latex" /> for player B is strictly dominant.  Then by Theorem 2 any Nash equilibrium <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28i%27%2Cj%27%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(i&#039;,j&#039;)" class="latex" /> must have <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i%27+%3D+i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i&#039; = i" class="latex" />  and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j%27+%3D+j&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="j&#039; = j" class="latex" />.  So, there is certainly no Nash equilibrium <i>other than</i> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28i%2C+j%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(i, j)." class="latex" /></p>
<p>But we still need to check that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28i%2C+j%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(i, j)" class="latex" /> is a Nash equilibrium!  This means we need to check that:</p>
<p>1) For all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1+%5Cle+i%27+%5Cle+m%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="1 &#92;le i&#039; &#92;le m," class="latex" /> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A_%7Bi%27j%7D+%5Cle+A_%7Bij%7D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A_{i&#039;j} &#92;le A_{ij}." class="latex" /></p>
<p>2) For all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1+%5Cle+j%27+%5Cle+m%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="1 &#92;le j&#039; &#92;le m," class="latex" /> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B_%7Bij%27%7D+%5Cle+B_%7Bij%7D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B_{ij&#039;} &#92;le B_{ij}." class="latex" /></p>
<p>Part 1) is true because choice <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i" class="latex" /> is strictly dominant.  Part 2) is true because choice <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="j" class="latex" /> is strictly dominant.  &#9608;</p>
<p>We can restate Theorem 3 is a less precise but rather pretty way:</p>
<p><b>Corollary.</b>  If both players have a strictly dominant pure strategy, there exists a unique Nash equilibrium.</p>
<p>Here I&#8217;m saying &#8216;pure strategy&#8217; instead of &#8216;choice&#8217; just to prepare you for people who talk that way!</p>
<h3> Domination </h3>
<p>I realize that the terminology here has a kind of S&amp;M flavor to it, with all this talk of &#8216;strict domination&#8217; and the like.  But there&#8217;s nothing I can do about that&mdash;it&#8217;s standard!</p>
<p>Anyway, there&#8217;s also a less strict kind of dominance:</p>

</div>
<p>for all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="j." class="latex" />  Similarly, a choice <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="j" class="latex" /> for player B <b>dominates</b> a choice <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j%27&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="j&#039;" class="latex" /> if </p>

<p>But there is less we can do with this definition.  Why?  Here&#8217;s why:</p>
<p><b>Puzzle.</b> Find a normal-form two player game with 2 choices for each player, where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28i%2Cj%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(i,j)" class="latex" /> is a Nash equilibrium even though <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i" class="latex" /> is dominated by the other choice for player A and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="j" class="latex" /> is dominated by the other choice for player B.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2013/01/13/game-theory-part-2/">Last time</a> we started looking at 2-player normal form games.  The idea is that player A has <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="m" class="latex" /> different choices of which move to make, while player B has <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" /> choices, and we have two <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m+%5Ctimes+n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="m &#92;times n" class="latex" /> matrices of payoffs, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B." class="latex" />   If player A makes choice <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i" class="latex" /> and player B makes choice <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="j," class="latex" /> then the payoff to player A is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A_%7Bi+j%7D%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A_{i j}," class="latex" /> while  the payoff to player B is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B_%7Bi+j%7D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B_{i j}." class="latex" /></p>
<p>What should you do if you&#8217;re playing a game like this?  As we saw when playing rock-paper-scissors, sometimes the best thing is to adopt a strategy with some built-in randomness.  In this game, if your opponent knows what you&#8217;re going to do, he can exploit that and beat you!</p>
<p>A strategy involving randomness is called a <b>mixed strategy</b>.  They&#8217;re very important, and we&#8217;ll talk about them a lot.  But today we&#8217;ll only consider <b>pure strategies</b>, where we definitely choose <i>one</i> of the choices available, with no randomness.</p>
<p>Notice: there are as many pure strategies as there are choices!  For each choice, there&#8217;s a pure strategy where you always make that choice when playing the game.  So, a lot of people say &#8216;pure strategy&#8217; for what I call a &#8216;choice&#8217;.  Other people use the word &#8216;action&#8217;.</p>
<p>Anyway: let&#8217;s try to figure out the best pure strategy for each player, if we can.</p>
<p>Sometimes this is impossible. For example, rock-paper-scissors has no best pure strategy.  Could playing <b>rock</b> be best?  No, because paper beats rock.  Could playing paper be best?  No, because scissors  beats paper.  Could playing scissors be best?  No, because rock beats scissors.</p>
<p>But sometimes we can find a best pure strategy, and the ideas we meet will help us later when we study mixed strategies.  So, let&#8217;s dive in!</p>
<h3> Nash equilibria </h3>
<p>Suppose player A makes choice <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i" class="latex" /> and player B makes choice <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="j" class="latex" />.  Then we say <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28i%2Cj%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(i,j)" class="latex" /> is a <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium">Nash equilibrium</a></b> if neither player can improve their payoff by changing their choice.</p>
<p>For example, look at this game:</p>
<div align="center">
<table border="0">
<tr>
<td></td>
<td align="center"><font color="red"><b>1</b></font></td>
<td align="center"><font color="red"><b>2</b></font></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>1 &nbsp;&nbsp;</b></td>
<td align="center">(10,<font color="red">10</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align="center">(9,<font color="red">-1</font>)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>2</b></td>
<td align="center">(-1,<font color="red">1</font>)</td>
<td align="center">(-1,<font color="red">-1</font>)</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>Here we are writing the matrices <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B" class="latex" />  together in one table, like last time, with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> in black and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B" class="latex" /> in red.  But we could also separate them out:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+%3D+%5Cleft%28+%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Brr%7D+10+%26+9+%5C%5C+-1+%26+-1+%5Cend%7Barray%7D+%5Cright%29+%2C+%5Cqquad+B+%3D+%5Cleft%28+%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Brr%7D+10+%26+-1+%5C%5C+1+%26+-1+%5Cend%7Barray%7D+%5Cright%29++&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A = &#92;left( &#92;begin{array}{rr} 10 &amp; 9 &#92;&#92; -1 &amp; -1 &#92;end{array} &#92;right) , &#92;qquad B = &#92;left( &#92;begin{array}{rr} 10 &amp; -1 &#92;&#92; 1 &amp; -1 &#92;end{array} &#92;right)  " class="latex" /></div>
<p>It&#8217;s just a different way of conveying the same information.</p>
<p>Either way, it&#8217;s pretty clear what the players should do in this game!  Both players should make choice 1.  That way, they both win 10 points.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this pair of choices <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28i%2Cj%29+%3D+%281%2C1%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(i,j) = (1,1)" class="latex" /> is certainly a Nash equilibrium.  In other words: neither player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their choice!  If player A switches to choice 2, their payoff drops to -1 points.  If player B switches to choice 2, <i>their</i> payoff drops to -1 points.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s give an official definition of Nash equilibrium and then look at some trickier examples.   Remember, player A&#8217;s choices are <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i+%3D+1%2C+2%2C+%5Cdots+%2C+m%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i = 1, 2, &#92;dots , m," class="latex" /> while player B&#8217;s choices are <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j+%3D+1%2C+2%2C+%5Cdots%2C+n.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="j = 1, 2, &#92;dots, n." class="latex" /></p>
<p><b>Definition.</b>  Given a 2-player normal form game, a pair of choices <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28i%2Cj%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(i,j)" class="latex" /> is a <b>Nash equilibrium</b> if:</p>
<p>1) For all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1+%5Cle+i%27+%5Cle+m&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="1 &#92;le i&#039; &#92;le m" class="latex" />, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A_%7Bi%27j%7D+%5Cle+A_%7Bij%7D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A_{i&#039;j} &#92;le A_{ij}." class="latex" /></p>
<p>2)  For all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1+%5Cle+j%27+%5Cle+n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="1 &#92;le j&#039; &#92;le n" class="latex" />, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B_%7Bij%27%7D+%5Cle+B_%7Bij%7D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B_{ij&#039;} &#92;le B_{ij}." class="latex" /></p>
<p>Condition 1) says that player A can&#8217;t improve their payoff by switching their choice from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i" class="latex" /> to any other choice <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i%27.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i&#039;." class="latex" />  Condition 2) says that player B can&#8217;t improve their payoff by switching their choice from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="j" class="latex" /> to any other choice <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j%27.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="j&#039;." class="latex" /></p>
<h3> Examples </h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at more examples of Nash equilibria, to see some funny things that can happen.  First let&#8217;s modify the last game a little:</p>
<div align="center">
<table border="0">
<tr>
<td></td>
<td align="center"><font color="red"><b>1</b></font></td>
<td align="center"><font color="red"><b>2</b></font></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>1 &nbsp;&nbsp;</b></td>
<td align="center">(10,<font color="red">10</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align="center">(-1,<font color="red">10</font>)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>2</b></td>
<td align="center">(10,<font color="red">-1</font>)</td>
<td align="center">(-1,<font color="red">-1</font>)</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>Is there a Nash equilibrium?  Yes&#8212;and just as before, it happens when both players pick pure strategy 1.  Now player A&#8217;s payoff doesn&#8217;t get any <i>worse</i> when they switch to pure strategy 2.  But it doesn&#8217;t <i>improve</i>, either!  It stays equal to 10.  Similarly, player B&#8217;s payoff doesn&#8217;t get any worse when they switch to pure strategy 2&#8230; but it doesn&#8217;t improve.  So, neither player is motivated to change their strategy.</p>
<p>I said a Nash equilibrium is a situation where neither player can improve their payoff by changing their choice. But it might be clearer to say: neither player can improve their payoff by <i>unilaterally</i> changing their choice.</p>
<p>What do I mean by &#8216;unilaterally&#8217; changing their choice?  I mean that one player changes their choice while the other player does not change <i>their</i> choice.</p>
<p>But if <i>both</i> players change their choices <i>simultaneously</i>, sometimes they can improve both their payoffs!  Lets see an example of that:</p>
<div align="center">
<table border="0">
<tr>
<td></td>
<td align="center"><font color="red"><b>1</b></font></td>
<td align="center"><font color="red"><b>2</b></font></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>1 &nbsp;&nbsp;</b></td>
<td align="center">(10,<font color="red">10</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align="center">(9,<font color="red">-1</font>)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>2</b></td>
<td align="center">(-1,<font color="red">8</font>)</td>
<td align="center">(20,<font color="red">20</font>)</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>Now it looks like both players will be happiest if they pick pure strategy 2.  And it&#8217;s true!  Moreover, this is a Nash equilibrium.   Check and see.</p>
<p>But what if both players pick choice 1?  This is <i>also</i> a Nash equilibrium!  Shocking but true.  If they both use pure strategy 1, neither player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their choice.  If player A changes <i>her</i> choice, her payoff drops to -1.  And if player B changes <i>his</i> choice, his payoff drops to -1.</p>
<p>Of course, they can improve their payoff if they both <i>simultaneously</i> change their choice to 2. But that&#8217;s not what the concept of Nash equilibrium is about.</p>
<p>This raises the question of whether Nash equilibrium is a good definition of &#8216;the best&#8217; choice for each player.  The big problem is figuring out what &#8216;best&#8217; means&#8212;we&#8217;ll have to talk about that more.   But we&#8217;re also seeing some problems with the word &#8216;the&#8217;.  There may be <i>more than one</i> Nash equilibrium, so we can&#8217;t always talk about &#8216;the&#8217; Nash equilibrium.</p>
<p>In other words, our example shows there isn&#8217;t always a <i>unique</i> Nash equilibrium.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a Nash equilibrium doesn&#8217;t always <i>exist!</i> Check out the game of rock-paper-scissors:</p>
<div align="center">
<table border="0">
<tr>
<td></td>
<td align="center"><font color="red"><b>rock</b></font></td>
<td align="center"><font color="red"><b>paper</b></font></td>
<td align="center"><font color="red"><b>scissors</b></font></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>rock &nbsp;&nbsp;</b></td>
<td align="center">(0,<font color="red">0</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align="center">(-1,<font color="red">1</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align="center">(1,<font color="red">-1</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>paper &nbsp; &nbsp;</b></td>
<td align="center">(1,<font color="red">-1</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align="center">(0,<font color="red">0</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align="center">(-1,<font color="red">1</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>scissors &nbsp; &nbsp;</b></td>
<td align="center">(-1,<font color="red">1</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align="center">(1,<font color="red">-1</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align="center">(0,<font color="red">0</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to see that there&#8217;s no Nash equilibrium.  No matter what both players choose, at least one of them can always improve their payoff by switching to a different choice.  If one of them wins the game, the loser can improve their payoff by switching to a different choice.  If it&#8217;s a tie, either player can improve their payoff by switching to a different choice.</p>
<p>So: Nash equilibria are interesting, but they don&#8217;t always exist&#8212; at least not when we consider only pure strategies, as we&#8217;ve been doing. And even when they do, they&#8217;re not always unique!  This is a bit frustrating.  We&#8217;d like game theory to tell us how to play games well.</p>
<p>We can improve the situation by allowing <b>mixed strategies</b>, where a player picks different choices with different probabilities.  If we do this, there is always at least one Nash equilibrium!  This result was proved by&#8212;you guessed it!&#8212;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Forbes_Nash,_Jr.">John Nash</a>.  He did it in 1950, in this astoundingly short paper:</p>
<p>&bull; John F. Nash, Jr., <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/36/1/48.full">Equilibrium points in n-person games</a>, <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i> <b>36</b> (1950), 48–9.</p>
<p>He eventually won the Nobel prize in economics for this work.</p>
<p>In fact, Nash was not the first to think about Nash equilibria; this idea goes back to the French economist Antoine Cournot, who wrote about it way back in 1838!  However, Nash was the first to consider Nash equilibria for mixed strategies for general simultaneous multi-player games, and prove they always exist.  (As we&#8217;ll see later, von Neumann and Morgenstern had already done this for the zero-sum 2-player games.)</p>
<h3> John Nash </h3>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t seen the movie about Nash called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Beautiful_Mind_%28film%29"><i>A Beautiful Mind</i></a>, you should!   Here&#8217;s the scene where Nash figures out something about multiplayer games:</p>
<div align="center"><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2d_dtTZQyUM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span></div>
<p>It&#8217;s not very clear, mathematically speaking&#8230; but oh well.  It&#8217;s a good movie and it gives you some sense of how Nash battled with mental illness for much of his life.  He has now largely recovered and spends his time at Princeton University.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Tomorrow I&#8217;m giving a talk in the econometrics seminar at U.C. Riverside.  I was invited to speak on my work on network theory, so I don&#8217;t feel too bad about the fact that I&#8217;ll be saying only a little about economics and practically nothing about econometrics.  Still, I&#8217;ve tried to slant the talk in a way that emphasizes possible applications to economics and game theory.  Here are the slides:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/econ.pdf">Network Theory</a>.</p>
<p>For long-time readers here the fun comes near the end.  I explain how <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/networks_17.html">reaction networks</a> can be used to describe <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/06/24/information-geometry-part-12/">evolutionary games</a>.  I point out that in certain classes of evolutionary games, evolution tends to increase <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_%28biology%29">&#8216;fitness&#8217;</a>, and/or lead the players to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium">&#8216;Nash equilibrium&#8217;</a>.  For precise theorems you&#8217;ll have to click the links in my talk and read the references!   </p>
<p>I conclude with an example: a game with three strategies and 7 Nash equilibria.  Here evolution makes the proportion of these three strategies follow these flow lines, at least in the limit of large numbers of players:</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2013/01/06/game-theory-part-1/">Last time</a> we classified games in a few ways.  This time we&#8217;ll start by looking at a very simple class of games: simultaneous noncooperative two-player games.  </p>
<h3> Simultaneous games </h3>
<p>Remember that in a <b>simultaneous</b> game, each player makes their moves without knowing anything about the other player&#8217;s move.  Thanks to this, we can condense each player&#8217;s move into a single move.  For example, in a card game, if one player lays down a king and then an ace, we can mathematically treat this as a single move, called &#8220;lay down a king and then an ace&#8221;.  So, we&#8217;ll say each player makes just one move&#8212;and they make it without knowing the other player&#8217;s move.  </p>
<p>In class we&#8217;ll play these games like this.  I will decide on my move and write it down on a piece of paper. You&#8217;ll make your move and click either A,B,C,D, or E on your <a href="http://clickers.ucr.edu/clicker/publicStuFAQPage">clicker</a>. </p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.reed.edu/cis/mlab/assets/images/clickers1.jpg" />
</div>
<p>Then I&#8217;ll reveal my piece of paper!  At that point, we&#8217;ll each know what both of us did&#8230; but neither of us can change our move.  </p>
<p>So, we each make our move without knowing each other&#8217;s move.</p>
<h3> Two-player games </h3>
<p>Since lots of you will be clicking your clicker at once, you could say there are more than two players in this game.  But your payoff&#8212;the number of points you win or lose&#8212;will depend only on what <i>you</i> did and what <i>I</i> did.  So, we can  treat this game as a bunch of independent two-player games&#8212;and that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ll do.</p>
<h3>  Noncooperative games </h3>
<p>Remember, we use words in funny ways in mathematics!  An &#8216;imaginary&#8217; number is not imaginary in the usual sense; a &#8216;partial&#8217; differential equation isn&#8217;t just part of a differential equation, and so on.  In game theory we use the word &#8216;noncooperative&#8217; in a funny way.  We say a game is <b>noncooperative</b> if the players aren&#8217;t able to form binding commitments.   This means that when we play our games, you and I can&#8217;t talk before the game and promise to do certain things.</p>
<p>There will, however, be games where both of us win if we make the right choice, and both of us lose if we don&#8217;t!   In games like this, if we can figure out how to cooperate without communicating ahead of time and making promises, that&#8217;s allowed! </p>
<h3>  Chicken </h3>
<p>Now let&#8217;s actually look at an example: the game of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_%28game%29"><b>chicken</b></a>.  In  this game we drive toward each other at high speed along a one-lane road in the desert.  The one who swerves off the road at the last minute gets called a <i>chicken</i>, and the other driver gets called a <i>hero</i>.  If we both swerve off the road at the last minute, we&#8217;re both called chickens.  But if neither of us does, our cars crash and we both die!</p>
<p>Sounds fun, eh?  </p>
<p>In real life we could each wait as long as possible and see if the other driver starts to swerve.   This makes chicken into a sequential rather than simultaneous game!  You could also promise that you wouldn&#8217;t swerve.  This makes chicken into a cooperative game!</p>
<p>Indeed there are all sorts of variations and complications in real life.  You can see some in the famous movie <i>Rebel Without a Cause</i>, starring James Dean.  Take a look at what happens:</p>
<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u7hZ9jKrwvo?version=3&#038;rel=0&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span>
<p>This movie version actually involves driving toward a cliff and jumping out at the last possible moment.  </p>
<p>But mathematics, as usual, is about finding problems that are simple enough to state precisely.  So in our simple mathematical version of chicken, we&#8217;ll say each player has just two choices:</p>
<p><b>1</b>: stay on the road.<br />
<b>2</b>: swerve off the road at the last second.</p>
<p>Also, we&#8217;ll express our payoffs in terms of numbers.  A negative payoff is bad, a positive one is good:</p>
<p>&bull;  If either player swerves off the road they get called a chicken, which is bad, so let&#8217;s say they get -1 points.  </p>
<p>&bull; If one player stays on the road and other swerves off the road, the one who stays on the road gets called a hero, so let&#8217;s say they get 1 point.</p>
<p>&bull; If both players stay on the road they both die, so let&#8217;s say they both get -10 points.</p>
<p>We can summarize all this in a little table:</p>
<div align="center">
<table border="0">
<tr>
<td></td>
<td align="center"><font color="red"><b>1</b></font></td>
<td align="center"><font color="red"><b>2</b></font></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>1 &nbsp;&nbsp;</b></td>
<td align="center">(-10,<font color="red">-10</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align="center">(1,<font color="red">-1</font>)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>2</b></td>
<td align="center">(-1,<font color="red">1</font>)</td>
<td align="center">(-1,<font color="red">-1</font>)</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>Let&#8217;s say the players are you and me.  Your choices 1 and 2 are shown in in black: you get to pick which row of the table we use.  <font color="red">My choices 1 and 2 are in red: I get to pick which column of the table we use.</font></p>
<p>There are four possible ways we can play the game.  For each of the four possibilities we get a pair of numbers.  The first number, in black, is your payoff.   <font color="red">The second, in red, is my payoff.</font></p>
<p>For example, suppose you choose <b>1</b> and I choose <font color="red"><b>2</b></font>.  Then you&#8217;re a hero and I&#8217;m a chicken.   So, your payoff is 1 and mine is -1.   That&#8217;s why we get the pair of numbers (1,<font color="red">-1</font>) in the 1st row and 2nd column of this table.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s play this game a bit!  Later we&#8217;ll study it in different ways.</p>
<h3> Rock-paper-scissors </h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s another famous game: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors"><b>rock-paper-scissors</b></a>.  </p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors"><img width="450" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/Rock_paper_scissors.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>Each player can choose either <b>rock</b>, <b>paper</b> or <b>scissors</b>.   Paper beats rock, scissors beats paper, and rock beats scissors.  In these cases let&#8217;s say the winner gets a payoff of 1, while the loser gets a payoff of -1.   If both players make the same choice, it&#8217;s a tie, so let&#8217;s say both players get a payoff of 0.  </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a table that describes this game:</p>
<div align="center">
<table border="0">
<tr>
<td></td>
<td align="center"><font color="red"><b>rock</b></font></td>
<td align="center"><font color="red"><b>paper</b></font></td>
<td align="center"><font color="red"><b>scissors</b></font></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>rock &nbsp;&nbsp;</b></td>
<td align="center">(0,<font color="red">0</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align="center">(-1,<font color="red">1</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align="center">(1,<font color="red">-1</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>paper &nbsp; &nbsp;</b></td>
<td align="center">(1,<font color="red">-1</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align="center">(0,<font color="red">0</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align="center">(-1,<font color="red">1</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>scissors &nbsp; &nbsp;</b></td>
<td align="center">(-1,<font color="red">1</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align="center">(1,<font color="red">-1</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align="center">(0,<font color="red">0</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>Your choices and payoffs are in black, while mine are in red.  </p>
<p>For example, if you choose <b>rock</b> and I choose <b><font color="red">paper</font></b>, we can look up what happens, and it&#8217;s (-1,<font color="red">1</font>).  That means your payoff is -1 while mine is 1.  So I win!  <img src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/emoticons/devil.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>To make this table look more mathematical, we can make up numbers for our choices:</p>
<p><b>1</b>: rock<br />
<b>2</b>: paper<br />
<b>3</b>: scissors</p>
<p>Then the table looks like this:</p>
<div align="center">
<table border="0">
<tr>
<td></td>
<td align="center"><font color="red"><b>1</b></font></td>
<td align="center"><font color="red"><b>2</b></font></td>
<td align="center"><font color="red"><b>3</b></font></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>1 &nbsp;&nbsp;</b></td>
<td align="center">(0,<font color="red">0</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align="center">(-1,<font color="red">1</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align="center">(1,<font color="red">-1</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>2</b></td>
<td align="center">(1,<font color="red">-1</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align="center">(0,<font color="red">0</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align="center">(-1,<font color="red">1</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>3</b></td>
<td align="center">(-1,<font color="red">1</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align="center">(1,<font color="red">-1</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align="center">(0,<font color="red">0</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>Let&#8217;s play this game a bit, and then discuss it!</p>
<h3> Normal form </h3>
<p>In the games we&#8217;re studying now, each player can make various choices.  In game theory these choices are often called <b>pure strategies</b>.  We&#8217;ll see why later on in this course.</p>
<p>In our examples so far, each player has the same set of pure strategies.    But this is not required!   You could have some set of pure strategies and I could have some other set.  </p>
<p>For now let&#8217;s only think about games where we both have a <i>finite</i> set of pure strategies.  For example, you could have 4 pure strategies and I could have 2.  Then we could have a game like this:</p>
<div align="center">
<table border="0">
<tr>
<td></td>
<td align="center"><font color="red"><b>1</b></font></td>
<td align="center"><font color="red"><b>2</b></font></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>1 &nbsp;&nbsp;</b></td>
<td align="center">(0,<font color="red">0</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align="center">(-1,<font color="red">1</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>2</b></td>
<td align="center">(2,<font color="red">-1</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align="center">(0,<font color="red">0</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>3</b></td>
<td align="center">(-2,<font color="red">1</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align="center">(1,<font color="red">-1</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>4</b></td>
<td align="center">(0,<font color="red">1</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align="center">(2,<font color="red">0</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>This way of describing a game using a table of pairs of numbers is called <b>normal form</b>, and you can read about it here:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal-form_game">Normal-form game</a>, Wikipedia.</p>
<p>There are other ways to describe the same information.  For example, instead of writing </p>
<div align="center">
<table border="0">
<tr>
<td></td>
<td align="center"><font color="red"><b>1</b></font></td>
<td align="center"><font color="red"><b>2</b></font></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>1 &nbsp;&nbsp;</b></td>
<td align="center">(0,<font color="red">0</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align="center">(-1,<font color="red">1</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>2</b></td>
<td align="center">(2,<font color="red">-1</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align="center">(0,<font color="red">0</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>3</b></td>
<td align="center">(-2,<font color="red">1</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align="center">(1,<font color="red">-1</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>4</b></td>
<td align="center">(0,<font color="red">1</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align="center">(2,<font color="red">0</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>we can write everything in black:</p>
<div align="center">
<table border="0">
<tr>
<td></td>
<td align="center"><font color="black"><b>1</b></font></td>
<td align="center"><font color="black"><b>2</b></font></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>1 &nbsp;&nbsp;</b></td>
<td align="center">(0,<font color="black">0</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align="center">(-1,<font color="black">1</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>2</b></td>
<td align="center">(2,<font color="black">-1</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align="center">(0,<font color="black">0</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>3</b></td>
<td align="center">(-2,<font color="black">1</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align="center">(1,<font color="black">-1</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>4</b></td>
<td align="center">(0,<font color="black">1</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td align="center">(2,<font color="black">0</font>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>All the information is still there!  It&#8217;s just a bit harder to see.  The colors are just to make it easier on you.</p>
<p>Mathematicians like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_%28mathematics%29">matrices</a>, which are rectangular boxes of numbers.  So, it&#8217;s good to use these to describe normal-form games.   To do this we take our table and chop it into two.  We write one matrix for your payoffs:</p>
<div align="center">

</div>
<p>and one for mine:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B+%3D+%5Cleft%28+%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Brr%7D+0+%26+1+%5C%5C+-1+%26+0+%5C%5C+1+%26+-1+%5C%5C+1+%26+0+%5Cend%7Barray%7D+%5Cright%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B = &#92;left( &#92;begin{array}{rr} 0 &amp; 1 &#92;&#92; -1 &amp; 0 &#92;&#92; 1 &amp; -1 &#92;&#92; 1 &amp; 0 &#92;end{array} &#92;right) " class="latex" />
</div>
<p>The number in the ith row and jth column of the matrix <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> is called <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A_%7Bi+j%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A_{i j}" class="latex" />, and similarly for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B" class="latex" />.  For example, if you pick choice 3 in this game and I pick choice 2, your payoff is</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A_%7B32%7D+%3D+1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A_{32} = 1" class="latex" />

<p>and my payoff is</p>

</div>
<h3> Definition </h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s summarize everything we&#8217;ve learned today!  Remember, an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m+%5Ctimes+n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="m &#92;times n" class="latex" /> matrix has <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="m" class="latex" /> rows and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" /> columns.  So, we can say:</p>
<p><b>Definition.</b>  A <b>2-player normal-form game</b> consists of two <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m+%5Ctimes+n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="m &#92;times n" class="latex" /> matrices of real numbers, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B." class="latex" /> </p>
<p>This definition is very terse and abstract.  That&#8217;s what mathematicians like!  But we have to unfold it a bit to understand it.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s call you &#8216;player A&#8217; and me &#8216;player B&#8217;.  Then the idea here is that player A can choose among pure strategies <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i+%3D+1%2C2%2C%5Cdots+%2C+m&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i = 1,2,&#92;dots , m" class="latex" /> while player B can choose among pure strategies <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j+%3D+1%2C2%2C%5Cdots%2C+n.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="j = 1,2,&#92;dots, n." class="latex" />   Suppose player A makes choice <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i" class="latex" /> and player B makes choice <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="j." class="latex" />  Then the payoff to player A is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A_%7Bi+j%7D%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A_{i j}," class="latex" /> and the payoff to player B is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B_%7Bi+j%7D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B_{i j}." class="latex" /></p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>I&#8217;m teaching an undergraduate course on game theory and I thought I&#8217;d try writing my course notes on this blog.  I invite students (and everyone else in the universe) to ask questions, correct my mistakes, add useful extra information and references, and so on.</p>
<p>However, I should warn the geniuses who usually read this blog that <b>these notes will not be filled with deep insights: it&#8217;s just a introductory course</b>.</p>
<p>I should also warn the students in my class that <b>these notes are not a substitute for taking notes in class!  I&#8217;ll tell you a lot of other stuff in class!</b></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s get started.</p>
<h3> Examples of games </h3>
<p>Mathematicians use words differently from normal people.  When you hear the word &#8216;game&#8217; you probably think about examples like:</p>
<p>&bull; board games like checkers, chess, go, Scrabble, Monopoly, Risk and so on.</p>
<div align="center"><img width="300" src="https://i1.wp.com/bangkokchess.com/wp-content/uploads/Dogchess.jpg" /></div>
<p>&bull; card games like solitaire, poker, bridge, blackjack, and so on.</p>
<p>&bull; sports involving athletic skill like football, basketball, baseball, hockey, tennis, squash, golf, croquet, horseshoes and so on.</p>
<p>&bull; video games and computer games&#8212;I&#8217;m too much of an old fogey to even bother trying to list some currently popular ones.</p>
<p>&bull; game shows on TV&#8212;ditto, though <i>Jeopardy</i> is still on the air.</p>
<p>&bull; role-playing games&#8212;ditto, though some people still play Dungeons and Dragons.</p>
<p>&bull; &#8216;war games&#8217; used by armies to prepare for wars.</p>
<p>Game theory is relevant to all these games, but more generally to any situation where one or more players interact, each one trying to achieve their own goal.   The players can be people but they don&#8217;t need to be: they can also be animals or even other organisms!  So, game theory is also used to study</p>
<p>&bull; biology</p>
<p>&bull; economics</p>
<p>&bull; politics</p>
<p>&bull; sociology</p>
<p>&bull; psychology</p>
<p>For example, here is a &#8216;game&#8217; I often play with my students.  Some students want to get a passing grade while coming to class as little as possible.  I want to make them come to every class.  But, I want to spend as little time on this task as possible.</p>
<p>What should I do?  I don&#8217;t want to take attendance every day, because that takes a lot of time in a big class.  I give quizzes <i>on random days</i> and make it hard for students to pass unless they take most of these quizzes.  I only need to give a few quizzes, but the students need to come to every class, since they don&#8217;t know when a quiz will happen.</p>
<p>How do the students respond?   Lots of them come to class every time.  But some try to &#8216;bend the rules&#8217; of the game, mainly trying to get my sympathy.  They invent clever excuses for why they missed the quizzes: dying grandmothers, etc.  They try to persuade me to &#8216;drop the lowest quiz score&#8217;.  They try to convince me that it&#8217;s unreasonable to make quizzes count for so much of the grade.  After all, it&#8217;s easy to get a bad score on a quiz, when there&#8217;s not much time to answer a question about something you just learned recently.</p>
<p>How do I respond?  Only the last idea moves me.  So, I set things up so missing a quiz gives you a much worse score than taking the quiz and getting it completely wrong.  In fact, just to dramatize this, I give students a <i>negative score</i> if they miss a quiz.</p>
<p>How the students respond?  Some of them argue that it&#8217;s somehow evil to give people negative scores.  But at this point I bare my fangs, smile, and nod, and the game ends.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to emphasize that other students have different goals: some want to come to class every time and learn as much as possible!  In this case my goals and the students&#8217; goals don&#8217;t conflict very much.  As we&#8217;ll see, in mathematical game theory there are plenty of games where the players cooperate as well as compete&#8230; or even just cooperate.</p>
<p>Mathematical game theory tends to focus on games where the most important aspect of the game is choosing among different strategies.  Games where the most important aspect is physical ability are harder to analyze using mathematics.  So are games where it&#8217;s possible to &#8216;bend the rules&#8217; in a huge number of different ways.</p>
<p>Game theory works best when we can:</p>
<p>&bull; list the set of choices each player can make,</p>
<p>&bull; clearly describe what happens when each player makes a given choice.</p>
<p>&bull; clearly describe the &#8216;payoff&#8217; or &#8216;winnings&#8217; for each player, which will of course depend on the choices all the players make.</p>
<h3> Classifying games </h3>
<p>We can classify games in many different ways.  For example:</p>
<p>&bull; <b>The number of players</b>.  There are single-player games (like solitaire), two-player games (like chess or &#8216;rock, paper, scissors&#8217;), and multi-player games (like poker or Monopoly).</p>
<p>&bull; <b>Simultaneous versus sequential games.</b>  There are games where all players make their decisions simultaneously, or if they do not move simultaneously, the later players are unaware of the earlier players&#8217; actions, making them <i>effectively</i> simultaneous.  These are called <b>simultaneous games</b>.  There are also games where some players make decisions after knowing something about what other players have decided.  These are called <b>sequential games</b>.</p>
<p>The games people play for fun are very often sequential, but a surprisingly large part of the game theory we&#8217;ll discuss in class focuses on simultaneous games.   &#8216;Rock, paper, scissors&#8217; is an example of a simultaneous game, but we&#8217;ll see many more.</p>
<p>&bull; <b> Zero-sum versus nonzero-sum games.</b>  A <b>zero-sum game</b> is one where the total payoff to all the players is zero.  Thus, any player benefits only at the expense of others.</p>
<p>An example of a zero-sum game is poker, because each player wins exactly the total amount their opponents lose (ignoring the possibility of the house&#8217;s cut).  Chess, or any other two-player game with one winner and one loser, can also be seen as a zero-sum game: just say the winner wins $1 and the loser loses $1.</p>
<p>In nonzero-sum games, the total payoff to all players is not necessarily zero.  An example is &#8216;chicken&#8217;, the game where two people drive their cars at each other, and both cars crash if neither pulls off the road.  When this happens, <i>both players lose</i>.  There are also games where both players can win.</p>
<p>In two-person zero-sum games, the players have no reason to cooperate, because whatever one wins, the other loses.  In two-person nonzero-sum games, cooperation can be important.</p>
<p>&bull; <b> Symmetric and non-symmetric games.</b>  In a <b>symmetric game</b> the same rules apply to each player.  More precisely, each player has the same set of strategies to choose from, and the payoffs to each player are symmetrical when we interchange which player chooses which strategy.</p>
<p>In a <b>non-symmetric game</b>, this is not the case.  For example, we can imagine a non-symmetric version of poker where my hand always contains at least two aces, while no other player&#8217;s does.   This game is &#8216;unfair&#8217;, so people don&#8217;t play it for fun.  But games in everyday life, like the teacher-student game I mentioned, are often non-symmetric, and not always fun.</p>
<p>&bull; <b> Cooperative and non-cooperative games.</b>  A game is <b>cooperative</b> if the players are able to form binding commitments. That is, some players can promise to each that they will choose certain strategies, and these promises must be kept.   In <b>noncooperative games</b> there is no way to make sure promises are kept.</p>
<p>Our legal system has the concept of a &#8216;contract&#8217;, which is a way people can make binding commitments.</p>
<h3> Warning </h3>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot more to say about these ways of classifying games.  There are also other ways of classifying games that we haven&#8217;t discussed here.  But you can already begin to classify games you know.  Give it a try!  You&#8217;ll run into some interesting puzzles.</p>
<p>For example, chess is a two-person zero-sum sequential non-cooperative game.</p>
<p>Is it symmetric?  The strategies available to the first player, white, are different from those available to the second player, black. This is true of almost any sequential game where the players take turns moving.  So, we can say it&#8217;s not symmetric.</p>
<p>Or, we can imagine that the first move of chess is flipping a coin to see which player goes first!  Then the game becomes symmetric, because each player has an equal chance of becoming white or black.</p>
<h3> Puzzle </h3>
<p>I may put some puzzles on this blog, which are different than the homework for the course.  You can answer them on the blog!  If you&#8217;re a student in the course and you give a good answer, I&#8217;ll give you some extra credit.</p>
<p><b>Puzzle.</b>  What&#8217;s a &#8216;game of perfect information&#8217; and what&#8217;s a &#8216;game of complete information&#8217;?  What&#8217;s the difference?</p>

				<small>2 January, 2013</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2013/01/02/rolling-circles-and-balls-part-4/">Last time</a> I promised to show you how the problem of a little ball rolling on a big stationary ball can be described using an 8-dimensional number system called the split octonions&#8230; <i>if the big ball has a radius that’s 3 times the radius of the little one!</i></p>
<p>So, let&#8217;s get started.</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="400" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/get_the_ball_rolling.jpg" /></div>
<p>First, I must admit that I lied.   </p>
<p>Lying is an important pedagogical technique.  The teacher simplifies the situation, so the student doesn&#8217;t get distracted by technicalities.  Then later&#8212;and this is crucial!&#8212;the teacher admits that certain statements weren&#8217;t really true, and corrects them.  It always makes me uncomfortable to do this.  But it works better than dumping all the technical details on the students right away.  In classes, I sometimes deal with my discomfort by <i>telling</i> the students: &#8220;Okay, now I&#8217;m going to lie a bit&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>What was my lie?  Instead of an ordinary ball rolling on another ordinary ball, we need a &#8216;spinorial&#8217; ball rolling on a &#8216;projective&#8217; ball.  </p>
<p>Let me explain that.</p>
<h3> A spinorial ball </h3>
<p>In physics, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor">spinor</a> is a kind of particle that you need to turn around <i>twice</i> before it comes back to the way it was.  Examples include electrons and protons.  </p>
<p>If you give one of these particles a full 360&deg; turn, which you can do using a magnetic field, it changes in a very subtle way.   You can only detect this change using clever tricks.  For example, take a polarized beam of electrons and send it through a barrier with two slits cut out.  Each electron goes through <i>both</i> slits, because it&#8217;s a wave as well as a particle.  Next, put a magnetic field next to one slit that&#8217;s precisely strong enough to rotate the electron by 360&deg; if it goes through that slit.  Then, make the beams recombine, and see how likely it is for electrons to be found at different locations.  You&#8217;ll get different results than if you turn off the magnetic field that rotates the electron!  </p>
<p>However, if you rotate a spinor by 720&deg;&#8212;that is, <i>two</i> full turns&#8212;it comes back to exactly the way it was.</p>
<p>This may seem very odd, but when you understand the math of spinors you see it all makes sense.  It&#8217;s a great example of how you have to follow the math where it leads you.  If something is mathematically allowed, nature may take advantage of that possibility, regardless of whether it seems odd to you.</p>
<p>So, I hope you can imagine a &#8216;spinorial&#8217; ball, which changes subtly when you turn it 360&deg; around any axis, but comes back to its original orientation when you turn it around 720&deg;.  If you can&#8217;t, I&#8217;ll present the math more rigorously later on.  That may or may not help.</p>
<h3> A projective ball </h3>
<p>What&#8217;s a &#8216;projective&#8217; ball?  It&#8217;s a ball whose surface is not a sphere, but a  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_plane">projective plane</a>.  A projective plane is a sphere that&#8217;s been modified so that diametrically opposite points count as the same point.  The north pole is the same as the south pole, and so on!   </p>
<p>In geography, the point diametrically opposite to some point on the Earth&#8217;s surface is called its <b>antipodes</b>, so let&#8217;s use that term.  There&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.freemaptools.com/tunnel-to-other-side-of-the-earth.htm">website</a> that lets you find the antipodes of any place on Earth.  Unfortunately the antipodes of most famous places are under water!  But the antipodes of Madrid is in New Zealand, near Wellington:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipodes"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Antipodes_LAEA.png/400px-Antipodes_LAEA.png" /></a></div>
<p>When we roll a little ball on a big &#8216;projective&#8217; ball, when the little ball reaches the antipodes of where it started, it counts as being back to its original location.</p>
<p>If you find this hard to visualize, imagine rolling <i>two indistinguishable</i> little balls on the big ball, that are always diametrically opposite each other.  When one little ball rolls to the antipodes of where it started, the other one has taken its place, and the situation looks just like when you started!</p>
<h3> A spinorial ball on a projective ball </h3>
<p>Now let&#8217;s combine these ideas.  Imagine a little spinorial ball rolling on a big projective ball.  You need to turn the spinorial ball around <i>twice</i> to make it come back to its original orientation.  But you only need to roll it <i>halfway</i> around the projective ball for it to come back to its original location.</p>
<p>These effects compensate for each other to some extent.  The first makes it twice as hard to get back to where you started.  The second makes it twice as easy!</p>
<p>But something really great happens when the big ball is 3 times as big as the little one.  And <i>that&#8217;s</i> what I want you to understand.</p>
<p>For starters, consider an ordinary ball rolling on another ordinary ball that&#8217;s the same size.  How many times does the rolling ball turn as it makes a round trip around the stationary one?  If you watch this you can see the answer:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardioid"><br />
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/cardioid_animation_2.gif" /></a></div>
<p>Follow the line drawn on the little ball.  It turns around not once, but <i>twice!</i> </p>
<p>Next, consider one ball rolling on another whose radius is 2 times as big.  How many times does the rolling ball turn as it makes a round trip?</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephroid"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/nephroid_animation_2.gif" /></a>
</div>
<p>It turns around 3 times.</p>
<p>And this pattern continues!   I don&#8217;t have animations proving it, so either take my word for it, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.2447">read our paper</a>, or show it yourself. </p>
<p>In particular, a ball rolling on a ball whose radius is 3 times as big will turn 4 times as it makes a round trip.</p>
<p>So, <i>by the time the little ball rolls halfway around the big one, it will have turned around twice!</i></p>
<p>But now suppose it&#8217;s a spinorial ball rolling on a projective plane.  This is perfect.  Now when the little ball goes halfway around big ball, it returns to its original location!  And turning around the little ball twice gets it back to its original orientation!  </p>
<p>So, there is something very neat about a spinorial ball rolling on a projective ball whose radius is exactly 3 times as big.    And this is just the start.  Now the split octonions get involved!</p>
<h3> The rolling ball geometry </h3>
<p>The key is to ponder a curious sort of geometry, which I&#8217;ll call the <b>rolling ball geometry</b>.  This has &#8216;points&#8217; and &#8216;lines&#8217; which are defined in a funny way.  </p>
<p>A <b>point</b> is any way a little spinorial ball can touch a projective ball that is 3 times as big.  The lines are certain sets of points.  A <b>line</b> consists of all the points we reach as the little ball rolls along some great circle on the big one, without slipping or twisting.  </p>
<p>Of course these aren&#8217;t &#8216;points&#8217; and &#8216;lines&#8217; in the usual sense.   But ever since the late 1800s, when mathematicians got excited about projective geometry&#8212;which is the geometry of the projective plane&#8212;we&#8217;ve enjoyed studying all sorts of strange variations on Euclidean geometry, with weirdly defined &#8216;points&#8217; and &#8216;lines&#8217;.   The rolling ball geometry fits very nicely into this tradition.</p>
<p>But the amazing thing is that we can describe points and lines of the rolling ball geometry in a completely different way, using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-octonion">split octonions</a>.   </p>
<h3> Split octonions </h3>
<p>How does it work?  As I said last time, the split octonions are an 8-dimensional number system.  We build them as follows.  We start with the ordinary real numbers.  Then we throw in 3 square roots of -1, called <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i%2C+j%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i, j," class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" />, obeying</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ij+%3D+-ji+%3D+k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="ij = -ji = k" class="latex" /><br />
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=jk+%3D+-kj+%3D+i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="jk = -kj = i" class="latex" /><br />
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ki+%3D+-ik+%3D+j&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="ki = -ik = j" class="latex" />
</div>
<p>At this point we have a famous 4-dimensional number system called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion">quaternions</a>.  Quaternions are numbers like </p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a+%2B+bi+%2B+cj+%2B+dk&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a + bi + cj + dk" class="latex" />
</div>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%2Cb%2Cc%2Cd&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a,b,c,d" class="latex" /> are real numbers and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i%2C+j%2C+k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i, j, k" class="latex" /> are the square roots of -1 we just created.</p>
<p>To build the octonions, we would now throw in another square root of -1.  But to build the split octonions, we instead throw in a square root of +1.  Let&#8217;s call it <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cell.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;ell." class="latex" />  The hard part is saying what rules it obeys when we start multiplying it with other numbers in our system.  </p>
<p>For starters, we get three more numbers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cell+i%2C+%5Cell+j%2C+%5Cell+k.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;ell i, &#92;ell j, &#92;ell k." class="latex" />  We decree these to be square roots of +1.  But what happens when we multiply these with other things?   For example, what is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cell+i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;ell i" class="latex" /> times <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="j," class="latex" /> and so on?  </p>
<p>Since I don&#8217;t want to bore you, I&#8217;ll just get this over with quickly by showing you the multiplication table:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-octonion"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/split_octonion_multiplication_table.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>This says that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cell+i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;ell i" class="latex" /> (read down) times <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="j" class="latex" /> (read across) is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=-%5Cell+k%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="-&#92;ell k," class="latex" /> and so on.  </p>
<p>Of course, this table is completely indigestible.  I could never remember it, and you shouldn&#8217;t try.  This is <i>not</i> the good way to explain how to multiply split octonions!  It&#8217;s the lazy way.   To really work with the split octonions you need a more conceptual approach, which John Huerta and I explain in <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.2447">our paper</a>.  But this is just a quick tour&#8230; so, on with the tour!  </p>
<p>A <b>split octonion</b> is any number like</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a+%2B+bi+%2B+cj+%2B+dk+%2B+e+%5Cell+%2B+f+%5Cell+i+%2B+g+%5Cell+j+%2B+h+%5Cell+k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a + bi + cj + dk + e &#92;ell + f &#92;ell i + g &#92;ell j + h &#92;ell k" class="latex" />
</div>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%2Cb%2Cc%2Cd%2Ce%2Cf%2Cg%2Ch&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h" class="latex" /> are real numbers.  Since it takes 8 real numbers to specify a split octonion, we say they&#8217;re an 8-dimensional number system.  But to describe the rolling ball geometry, we only need the <b>imaginary split octonions</b>, which are numbers like</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%3D+bi+%2B+cj+%2B+dk+%2B+e+%5Cell+%2B+f+%5Cell+i+%2B+g+%5Cell+j+%2B+h+%5Cell+k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x = bi + cj + dk + e &#92;ell + f &#92;ell i + g &#92;ell j + h &#92;ell k" class="latex" />
</div>
<p>The imaginary split octonions are 7-dimensional.  3 dimensions come from square roots of -1, while 4 come from square roots of 1.   </p>
<p>We can use them to make up a far-out variant of special relativity: a universe with 3 time dimensions and 4 space dimensions!   To do this, define the <b>length</b> of an imaginary split octonion <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> to be the number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7Cx+%5C%7C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;|x &#92;|" class="latex" /> with</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7Cx%5C%7C%5E2+%3D+-b%5E2+-+c%5E2+-+d%5E2+%2B+e%5E2+%2B+f%5E2+%2B+g%5E2+%2B+h%5E2+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;|x&#92;|^2 = -b^2 - c^2 - d^2 + e^2 + f^2 + g^2 + h^2 " class="latex" />
</div>
<p>This is a mutant version of the Pythagorean formula.  The length <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7Cx%5C%7C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;|x&#92;|" class="latex" /> is real, in fact positive, for split octonions that point in the space directions.  But it&#8217;s <i>imaginary</i> for those that point in the time directions!  </p>
<p>This should not sound weird if you know special relativity.   In special relativity we have <b>spacelike</b> vectors, whose length squared is positive, and <b>timelike</b> ones, whose length squared is negative.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t know special relativity&#8212;well, now you see how revolutionary Einstein&#8217;s ideas really are.</p>
<p>We also have vectors whose length squared is zero!  These are called <b>null</b>.  They&#8217;re also called <b>lightlike</b>, because light rays point along null vectors.  In other words: light moves just as far in the space directions as it does in the time direction, so it&#8217;s poised at the brink between being spacelike and timelike.  </p>
<h3> The punchline </h3>
<p>I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re wondering where all this is going.  Luckily, we&#8217;re there.  We can describe the rolling ball geometry using the imaginary split octonions!   Let me state it and then chat about it:</p>
<p><b>Theorem.</b>  There is a one-to-one correspondence between points in the rolling ball geometry and light rays through the point 0 in the imaginary split octonions.  Under this correspondence, lines in the rolling ball geometry correspond to planes containing the point 0 in the imaginary split octonions with the property that whenever <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y" class="latex" /> lie in this plane, then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=xy+%3D+0.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="xy = 0." class="latex" /></p>
<p>Even if you don&#8217;t get this, you can see it&#8217;s describing the rolling ball geometry in terms of stuff about the split octonions.  An immediate consequence is that any symmetry of the split octonions is a symmetry of the rolling ball geometry.  </p>
<p>The symmetries of the split octonions form a group called &#8216;the split form of G<sub>2</sub>’.   With more work, we can show the converse: any symmetry of the rolling ball geometry is a symmetry of the split octonions.   So, the symmetry group of the rolling ball geometry is precisely the split form of G<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>So what?</p>
<p>Well, G<sub>2</sub> is an &#8216;exceptional group&#8217;&#8212;one of five groups that were discovered only when mathematicians like Killing and Cartan systematically started trying to classify groups in the late 1800s.  The exceptional groups didn&#8217;t fit in the lists of groups mathematicians already knew.  </p>
<p>If, as Tim Gowers has argued, some math is invented while some is discovered, the exceptional groups were discovered.  Finding them was like going to the bottom of the ocean and finding weird creatures you never expected.  These groups were&#8212;and are&#8212;hard to understand!  They have dry, technical sounding names:  E<sub>6</sub>, E<sub>7</sub>, E<sub>8</sub>, F<sub>4</sub>, and G<sub>2</sub>.  They&#8217;re important in string theory&#8212;but again, just because the structure of mathematics forces it, not because people wanted it.  </p>
<p>The exceptional groups can all be described using the octonions, or split octonions. But the octonions are also rather hard to understand.  The rolling ball geometry, on the other hand, is rather simple and easy to visualize.  So, it&#8217;s a way of bringing some exotic mathematics a bit closer to ordinary life.</p>
<p>Well, okay&#8212;in ordinary life you&#8217;d probably never thought about a <i>spinorial</i> ball rolling on a <i>projective</i> ball.  But still: spinors and projective planes are far less exotic than split octonions and exceptional Lie groups.  Any mathematician worth their salt knows about spinors and projective planes.  They&#8217;re things that make plenty of sense.</p>
<p>I think now is a good time for most of you nonmathematicians to stop reading.   I&#8217;ll leave off with a New Year&#8217;s puzzle:</p>
<p><b>Puzzle:</b>  Relative to the fixed stars, how many times does the Earth turn around its axis in a year?</p>
<p>Bye!   It was nice seeing you! </p>
<h3> The gory details </h3>
<p>Still here?  Cool.  I want to wrap up by presenting the theorem in a more precise way, and then telling the detailed history of the rolling ball problem.</p>
<p>How can we specify a point in the rolling ball geometry?  We need to say the location where the little ball touches the big ball, and we need to describe the &#8216;orientation&#8217; of the little ball: that is, how it&#8217;s been rotated.  </p>
<p>The point where the little ball touches the big one is just any point on the surface of the big ball.   If the big ball were an ordinary ball this would be a point on the sphere, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S^2" class="latex" />.  But since it&#8217;s a <i>projective</i> ball, we need a point on the projective plane, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Cmathrm%7BP%7D%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}&#92;mathrm{P}^2" class="latex" />.   </p>
<p>To describe the orientation of the little ball we need to say how it&#8217;s been rotated from some standard orientation.   If the little ball were an ordinary ball we&#8217;d need to give an element of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_group_SO%283%29">rotation group</a>, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BSO%7D%283%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{SO}(3)." class="latex" />  But since it&#8217;s a <i>spinorial</i> ball we need an element of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covering_group">double cover</a> of the rotation group, namely the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_unitary_group">special unitary group</a> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BSU%7D%282%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{SU}(2)." class="latex" /></p>
<p>So, the space of points in the rolling ball geometry is </p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X+%3D+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Cmathrm%7BP%7D%5E2+%5Ctimes+%5Cmathrm%7BSU%7D%282%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X = &#92;mathbb{R}&#92;mathrm{P}^2 &#92;times &#92;mathrm{SU}(2)" class="latex" />
</div>
<p>This makes it easy to see how the imaginary split octonions get into the game.  For starters, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BSU%7D%282%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{SU}(2)" class="latex" /> is isomorphic to the group of unit quaternions.  We can define the absolute values of quaternions in a way that copies the usual formula for complex numbers:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%7Ca+%2B+bi+%2B+cj+%2B+dk%7C+%3D+%5Csqrt%7Ba%5E2+%2B+b%5E2+%2B+c%5E2+%2B+d%5E2%7D+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ |a + bi + cj + dk| = &#92;sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2} } " class="latex" />
</div>
<p>The great thing about the quaternions is that if we multiply two of them, their absolute values multiply.  In other words, if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="q" class="latex" /> are two quaternions,</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Cpq%7C+%3D+%7Cp%7C+%7Cq%7C+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="|pq| = |p| |q| " class="latex" />
</div>
<p>This implies that the quaternions with absolute value 1&#8212;the <b>unit quaternions</b>&#8212;are closed under multiplication.  In fact, they form a group.  And in fact, this group is just SU(2) in mild disguise!</p>
<p>The unit quaternions form a sphere.  Not an ordinary &#8216;2-sphere&#8217; of the sort we&#8217;ve been talking about so far, but a &#8216;3-sphere&#8217; in the 4-dimensional space of quaternions.  We call that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%5E3.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S^3." class="latex" /></p>
<p>So, the space of points in the rolling ball is isomorphic to a projective plane times a 3-sphere:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X+%5Ccong+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Cmathrm%7BP%7D%5E2+%5Ctimes+S%5E3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X &#92;cong &#92;mathbb{R}&#92;mathrm{P}^2 &#92;times S^3" class="latex" />
</div>
<p>But since the projective plane <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Cmathrm%7BP%7D%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}&#92;mathrm{P}^2" class="latex" /> is the sphere <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S^2" class="latex" /> with antipodal points counted as the same point, our space of points is</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+X+%5Ccong+%5Cfrac%7BS%5E2+%5Ctimes+S%5E3%7D%7B%28p%2Cq%29+%5Csim+%28-p%2Cq%29%7D%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ X &#92;cong &#92;frac{S^2 &#92;times S^3}{(p,q) &#92;sim (-p,q)}} " class="latex" />
</div>
<p>Here dividing or &#8216;modding out&#8217; by that stuff on the bottom says that we count any point <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28p%2Cq%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(p,q)" class="latex" /> in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%5E2+%5Ctimes+S%5E3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S^2 &#92;times S^3" class="latex" /> as the same as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28-p%2Cq%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(-p,q)." class="latex" />   </p>
<p>The cool part is that while <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%5E3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S^3" class="latex" /> is the unit quaternions, we can think of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S^2" class="latex" /> as the unit <i>imaginary</i> quaternions, where an <b>imaginary quaternion</b> is a number like</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=bi+%2B+cj+%2B+dk+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="bi + cj + dk " class="latex" />
</div>
<p>So, we&#8217;re describing a point in the rolling ball geometry using a unit quaternion and a unit imaginary quaternion.  That&#8217;s cool.  But we can improve this description a bit using a nonobvious fact:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+X+%5Ccong+%5Cfrac%7BS%5E2+%5Ctimes+S%5E3%7D%7B%28p%2Cq%29+%5Csim+%28-p%2C-q%29%7D%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ X &#92;cong &#92;frac{S^2 &#92;times S^3}{(p,q) &#92;sim (-p,-q)}} " class="latex" />
</div>
<p>There&#8217;s an extra minus sign here!  Now we&#8217;re counting any point <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28p%2Cq%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(p,q)" class="latex" /> in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%5E2+%5Ctimes+S%5E3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S^2 &#92;times S^3" class="latex" /> as the same as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28-p%2C-q%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(-p,-q)." class="latex" />   In Proposition 2 in <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.2447">our paper</a> we give an explicit formula for this isomorphism, which is important.</p>
<p>But never mind.   Here&#8217;s the point of this improvement: we can now describe a point in the rolling ball geometry as a light ray through the origin in the imaginary split octonions!   After all, any split octonion is of the form</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a+%2B+bi+%2B+cj+%2B+dk+%2B+e+%5Cell+%2B+f+%5Cell+i+%2B+g+%5Cell+j+%2B+h+%5Cell+k+%3D++p+%2B+%5Cell+q+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a + bi + cj + dk + e &#92;ell + f &#92;ell i + g &#92;ell j + h &#92;ell k =  p + &#92;ell q " class="latex" />

So, any <i>imaginary</i> split octonion is of the form</p>

<p>Given any light ray through the origin in the imaginary split octonions, it consists of all real multiples of some lightlike imaginary split octonion.  So, we can describe it using a pair <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28p%2Cq%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(p,q)" class="latex" /> where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p" class="latex" /> is an imaginary quaternion and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="q" class="latex" /> is a quaternion with the same absolute value as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p." class="latex" />  We can normalize them so they&#8217;re both unit quaternions&#8230; but <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28p%2Cq%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(p,q)" class="latex" /> and its negative <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28-p%2C-q%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(-p,-q)" class="latex" /> still determine the same light ray.  </p>
<p>So, the space of light rays through the origin in the imaginary split octonions is </p>

<p>But this is the space of points in the rolling ball geometry!  </p>
<p>Yay!  <img src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/emoticons/celebrating.gif" /></p>
<p>So far nothing relies on knowing how to multiply imaginary split octonions: we only need the formula for their length, which is much simpler.  It&#8217;s the <i>lines</i> in the rolling ball geometry that require multiplication.   In our paper, we show in Theorem 5 that lines correspond to 2-dimensional subspaces of the imaginary split octonions with the property that whenever <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2C+y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x, y" class="latex" /> lie in the subspace, then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+y+%3D+0.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x y = 0." class="latex" />  In particular this implies that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E2+%3D+0%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x^2 = 0," class="latex" /> which turns out to say that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> is lightlike.  So, these 2d subspaces consist of lightlike elements.  But the property that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+y+%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x y = 0" class="latex" /> whenever <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2C+y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x, y" class="latex" /> lie in the subspace is actually stronger!  And this is how the full strength of the split octonions gets used.</p>
<p>One last comment.  What if we hadn&#8217;t used a spinorial ball rolling on a projective ball?  What if we had used an ordinary ball rolling on another ordinary ball?  Then our space of points would be <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%5E2+%5Ctimes+%5Cmathrm%7BSO%7D%283%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S^2 &#92;times &#92;mathrm{SO}(3)." class="latex" />  This is a lot like the space <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> we&#8217;ve been looking at.  The only difference is a slight change in where we put the minus sign:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+S%5E2+%5Ctimes+%5Cmathrm%7BSO%7D%283%29+%5Ccong+%5Cfrac%7BS%5E2+%5Ctimes+S%5E3%7D%7B%28p%2Cq%29+%5Csim+%28p%2C-q%29%7D%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ S^2 &#92;times &#92;mathrm{SO}(3) &#92;cong &#92;frac{S^2 &#92;times S^3}{(p,q) &#92;sim (p,-q)}} " class="latex" />

<p>But this space is <i>different</i> than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X." class="latex" />  We could go ahead and define lines and look for symmetries of this geometry, but we wouldn&#8217;t get G<sub>2</sub>.  We&#8217;d get a much smaller group.   We&#8217;d also get a smaller symmetry group if we worked with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> but the big ball were anything other than 3 times the size of the small one.

<h3> The history </h3>
<p>I will resist telling you how to use geometric quantization to get back from the rolling ball geometry to the split octonions.  I will also resist telling you about &#8216;null triples&#8217;, which give specially nice bases for the split octonions.  This is where John Huerta really pulled out all the stops and used his octonionic expertise to its full extent.  For these things, you&#8217;ll just have to <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.2447">read our paper</a>.  </p>
<p>Instead, I want to tell you about the history of this problem.  This part is mainly for math history buffs, so I&#8217;ll freely fling around jargon that I&#8217;d been suppressing up to now.  This part is also where I give credit to all the great mathematicians who figured out most of the stuff I just explained!    I won&#8217;t include references, except for papers that are free online.  You can find them all in our paper.</p>
<p>On May 23, 1887, Wilhelm Killing wrote a letter to Friedrich Engel saying that he had found a 14-dimensional simple Lie algebra.  This is now called <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathfrak%7Bg%7D_2%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathfrak{g}_2," class="latex" /> because it&#8217;s the Lie algebra corresponding to the group G<sub>2</sub>.  By October he had completed classifying the simple Lie algebras, and in the next three years he published this work in a series of papers.  </p>
<p>Besides the already known classical simple Lie algebras, he claimed to have found six &#8216;exceptional&#8217; ones.  In fact he only gave a rigorous construction of the smallest, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathfrak%7Bg%7D_2.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathfrak{g}_2." class="latex" />   Later, in his famous 1894 thesis, &Eacute;lie Cartan constructed all of them and noticed that two of them were isomorphic, so that there are really only five.</p>
<p>But already in 1893, Cartan had published a note describing an open set in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BC%7D%5E5&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{C}^5" class="latex" /> equipped with a 2-dimensional &#8216;distribution&#8217;&#8212;a smoothly varying field of 2d spaces of tangent vectors&#8212;for which the Lie algebra  <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathfrak%7Bg%7D_2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathfrak{g}_2" class="latex" /> appears as the infinitesimal symmetries.  In the same year, and actually in the same journal, Engel noticed the same thing.  </p>
<p>In fact, this 2-dimensional distribution is closely related to the rolling ball problem.  The point is that the space of configurations of the rolling ball is 5-dimensional, with a 2-dimensional distibution that describes motions of the ball where it rolls without slipping or twisting.</p>
<p>Both Cartan and Engel returned to this theme in later work.  In particular, Engel discovered in 1900 that a generic antisymmetic trilinear form on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BC%7D%5E7&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{C}^7" class="latex" /> is preserved by a group isomorphic to the complex form of G<sub>2</sub>.  Furthermore, starting from this 3-form he constructed a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BC%7D%5E7.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{C}^7." class="latex" />   This implies that the complex form of G<sub>2</sub>. is contained in a group isomorphic to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BSO%7D%287%2C%5Cmathbb%7BC%7D%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{SO}(7,&#92;mathbb{C})" class="latex" />.  He also noticed that the vectors <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BC%7D%5E7&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x &#92;in &#92;mathbb{C}^7" class="latex" /> that are <b>null</b>&#8212;meaning <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%5Ccdot+x+%3D+0%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x &#92;cdot x = 0," class="latex" /> where we write the bilinear form as a dot product&#8212;define a 5-dimensional projective variety on which G<sub>2</sub> acts.</p>
<p>In fact, this variety is the complexification of the configuration space of a rolling fermionic ball on a projective plane!  Futhermore, the space <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BC%7D%5E7&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{C}^7" class="latex" /> is best seen as the complexification of the space of imaginary octonions.  Like the space of imaginary quaternions (better known as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}^3" class="latex" />), the 7-dimensional space of imaginary octonions comes with a dot product and cross product.  Engel&#8217;s bilinear form on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BC%7D%5E7&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{C}^7" class="latex" /> arises from complexifying the dot product.  His antisymmetric trilinear form arises from the dot product together with the cross product via the formula </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%5Ccdot+%28y+%5Ctimes+z%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x &#92;cdot (y &#92;times z)." class="latex" /></p>
<p>However, all this was seen only later!  It was only in 1908 that  Cartan mentioned that the automorphism group of the octonions is a 14-dimensional simple Lie group.  Six years later he stated something he probably had known for some time: this group is the compact real form of G<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>As I already mentioned, the octonions had been discovered long before: in fact the day after Christmas in 1843, by Hamilton&#8217;s friend John Graves.  Two months before that, Hamilton had sent Graves a letter describing his dramatic discovery of the quaternions.  This encouraged Graves to seek an even larger normed division algebra, and thus the octonions were born. Hamilton offered to publicize Graves&#8217; work, but put it off or forgot until the young Arthur Cayley rediscovered the octonions in 1845.  That this obscure algebra lay at the heart of <i>all</i> the exceptional Lie algebras and groups became clear only slowly.  Cartan&#8217;s realization of its relation to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathfrak%7Bg%7D_2%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathfrak{g}_2," class="latex" /> and his later work on a symmetry called &#8216;triality&#8217;, was the first step.</p>
<p>In 1910, Cartan wrote a paper that studied 2-dimensional distributions in 5 dimensions.  Generically such a distibution is not integrable: in other words, the Lie bracket of two vector fields lying in this distribution does not again lie in this distribution. However, it lies in a 3-dimensional distribution.  The Lie bracket of vector fields lying in this 3-dimensional distibution then generically give arbitrary tangent vectors to the 5-dimensional manifold.  Such a distribution is called a <b>(2,3,5) distribution</b>.  Cartan worked out a complete system of local geometric invariants for these distributions.  He showed that if all these invariants vanish, the infinitesimal symmetries of a (2,3,5) distribution in a neighborhood of a point form the Lie algebra <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathfrak%7Bg%7D_2.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathfrak{g}_2." class="latex" /></p>
<p>Again this is relevant to the rolling ball.  The space of configurations of a ball rolling on a surface is 5-dimensional, and it comes equipped with a (2,3,5) distribution.  The 2-dimensional distibution describes motions of the ball where it rolls without twisting or slipping.  The 3-dimensional distribution describes motions where it can roll and twist, but not slip.  Cartan did not discuss rolling balls, but he did consider a closely related example: curves of constant curvature 2 or 1/2 in the unit 3-sphere.</p>
<p>Beginning in the 1950&#8217;s, Francois Bruhat and Jacques Tits developed a very general approach to incidence geometry, eventually called the theory of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_%28mathematics%29">&#8216;buildings&#8217;</a>, which among other things gives a systematic approach to geometries having simple Lie groups as symmetries.  In the case of G<sub>2</sub>, because the Dynkin diagram of this group has two dots, the relevant geometry has two types of figure: points and lines.  Moreover because the Coxeter group associated to this Dynkin diagram is the symmetry group of a hexagon, a generic pair of points <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="d" class="latex" /> fits into a configuration like this, called an &#8216;apartment&#8217;:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/g2_apartment.jpg" /></div>
<p>There is no line containing a pair of points here except when a line is actually shown, and more generally there are no &#8216;shortcuts&#8217; beyond what is shown.  For example, we go from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="b" class="latex" /> by following just one line, but it takes two to get from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c," class="latex" /> and three to get from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="d." class="latex" />  </p>
<p>Betty Salzberg wrote a nice introduction to these ideas in 1982.  Among other things, she noted that the points and lines in the incidence geometry of the split real form of G<sub>2</sub> correspond to 1- and 2-dimensional null subalgebras of the imaginary split octonions.  This was shown by Tits in 1955.</p>
<p>In 1993, Bryant and Hsu gave a detailed treatment of curves in manifolds equipped with 2-dimensional distributions, greatly extending the work of Cartan:</p>
<p>&bull; Robert Bryant and Lucas Hsu, <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.46.7262">Rigidity of integral curves of rank 2 distributions</a>.</p>
<p>They showed how the space of configurations of one surface rolling on another fits into this framework.  However, Igor Zelenko may have been the first to explicitly mention a ball rolling on another ball in this context, and to note that something special happens when their ratio of radii is 3 or 1/3.  In a 2005 paper, he considered an invariant of (2,3,5) distributions.  He calculated it for the distribution arising from a ball rolling on a larger ball and showed it equals zero in these two cases. </p>
<p>(In our paper, John Huerta and I assume that the rolling ball is <i>smaller</i> than the fixed one, simply to eliminate one of these cases and focus on the case where the fixed ball is 3 times as big.)</p>
<p>In 2006, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0612469">Bor and Montgomery&#039;s paper</a> put many of the pieces together. They studied the (2,3,5) distribution on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%5E2+%5Ctimes+%5Cmathrm%7BSO%7D%283%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S^2 &#92;times &#92;mathrm{SO}(3)" class="latex" /> coming from a ball of radius 1 rolling on a ball of radius R, and proved a theorem which they credit to Robert Bryant.  First, passing to the double cover, they showed the corresponding distribution on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%5E2+%5Ctimes+%5Cmathrm%7BSU%7D%282%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S^2 &#92;times &#92;mathrm{SU}(2)" class="latex" /> has a symmetry group whose identity component contains the split real form of G<sub>2</sub> when R = 3 or 1/3.  Second, they showed this action does not descend to original rolling ball configuration space <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%5E2+%5Ctimes+%5Cmathrm%7BSO%7D%283%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S^2 &#92;times &#92;mathrm{SO}(3)." class="latex" />  Third, they showed that for any other value of R except R = 1, the symmetry group is isomorphic to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BSU%7D%282%29+%5Ctimes+%5Cmathrm%7BSU%7D%282%29%2F%5Cpm%281%2C1%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{SU}(2) &#92;times &#92;mathrm{SU}(2)/&#92;pm(1,1)." class="latex" />  They also wrote:</p>

<p>As you can see from what I&#8217;ve said, John Huerta and I have offered a solution to this puzzle: the ‘3’ comes from the fact that a ball rolling once around a ball 3 times as big turns around exactly 4 times&#8212;just what you need to get a relationship to a spinorial ball rolling on a projective plane, and thus the lightcone in the split octonions!  The most precise statement of this explanation comes in Theorem 3 of our paper.</p>
<p>While Bor and Montgomery&#8217;s paper goes into considerable detail about the connection with split octonions, most of their work uses the now standard technology of semisimple Lie algebras: roots, weights and the like.  In 2006, Sagerschnig described the incidence geometry of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BG%7D_2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{G}_2" class="latex" /> using the split octonions, and in 2008, Agrachev wrote a paper entitled <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0611812">&#8216;Rolling balls and octonions&#8217;</a>.  He emphasizes that the double cover <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%5E2+%5Ctimes+%5Cmathrm%7BSU%7D%282%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S^2 &#92;times &#92;mathrm{SU}(2)" class="latex" /> can be identified with the double cover of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BPC%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{PC}" class="latex" />, the projectivization of the set of null vectors in the imaginary split octonions.  He then shows that given a point <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+x+%5Crangle+%5Cin+%5Cmathrm%7BPC%7D%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;langle x &#92;rangle &#92;in &#92;mathrm{PC}," class="latex" /> the set of points <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+y+%5Crangle&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;langle y &#92;rangle" class="latex" /> connected to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+x+%5Crangle&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;langle x &#92;rangle" class="latex" /> by a single roll is the annihilator</p>

<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BI%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{I}" class="latex" /> is the space of imaginary split octonions.</p>
<p>This sketch of the history is incomplete in many ways.  As usual, history resembles a fractal: the more closely you study it, the more details you see!   If you want to dig deeper, I strongly recommend these: </p>

<p>It emphasizes the role that quaternions play in describing rotations, and the way an imaginary split octonion is built from an imaginary quaternion and a quaternion.  And don&#8217;t forget this:</p>

					<p>So far in this series we&#8217;ve been looking at what happens when we roll circles on circles:</p>
<p>&bull; In <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/08/31/rolling-circles-and-balls-part-1/">Part 1</a> we rolled a circle on a circle that&#8217;s the same size.  </p>

<p>&bull; In <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/09/11/rolling-circles-and-balls-part-3/">Part 3</a> we rolled a circle <i>inside</i> a circle that was 2, 3, or 4 times as big.  </p>

<p>In every case, we got lots of exciting math and pretty pictures.  But all this pales in comparison to the marvels that occur when we roll a <i>ball</i> on another <i>ball!</i>  </p>
<p>You&#8217;d never guess it, but the really amazing stuff happens when you roll a ball on another ball that&#8217;s exactly 3 times as big.  In that case, the geometry of what&#8217;s going on turns out to be related to special relativity in a weird universe with <i>3 time dimensions and 4 space dimensions!</i>  Even more amazingly, it&#8217;s related to a strange number system called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-octonion">split octonions</a>.  </p>
<p>The ordinary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octonion">octonions</a> are already strange enough.  They&#8217;re an 8-dimensional number system where you can add, subtract, multiply and divide.   They were invented in 1843 after the famous mathematician Hamilton invented a rather similar <i>4-dimensional</i> number system called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion">quaternions</a>.  He told his college pal John Graves about it, since Graves was the one who got Hamilton interested in this stuff in the first place&#8230; though Graves had gone on to become a lawyer, not a mathematician.  The day after Christmas that year, Graves sent Hamilton a letter saying he&#8217;d found an 8-dimensional number system with almost all the same properties!  The one big <i>missing</i> property was the associative law for multiplication, namely: </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28ab%29c+%3D+a%28bc%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(ab)c = a(bc) " class="latex" /></p>
<p>The quaternions obey this, but the octonions don&#8217;t.  For this and other reasons, they languished in obscurity for many years.   But they eventually turned out to be the key to understanding some otherwise inexplicable symmetry groups called &#8216;exceptional groups&#8217;.   Later still, they turned out to be important in string theory!  </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been fascinated by this stuff for a long time, in part because it starts out seeming crazy and impossible to understand&#8230; but eventually it makes sense.   So, it&#8217;s a great example of how you can dramatically change your perspective by thinking for a long time.   Also, it suggests that there could be patterns built into the structure of math, highly nonobvious patterns, which turn out to explain a lot about the universe. </p>
<p>About a decade ago I wrote a paper summarizing everything I&#8217;d learned so far:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/octonions/">The octonions</a>.</p>
<p>But I knew there was much more to understand.  I wanted to work on this subject with a student.  But I never dared until I met John Huerta, who, rather oddly, wanted to get a Ph.D. in math but work on <i>physics</i>.  That&#8217;s generally not a good idea.   But it&#8217;s exactly what <i>I</i> had wanted to do as a grad student, so I felt a certain sympathy for him.  </p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/~huerta/"><br />
<img width="250" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/huerta.jpg" /></a>
</div>
<p>And he seemed good at thinking about how algebra and particle physics fit together.  So, I decided we should start by writing a paper on &#8216;grand unified theories&#8217;&#8212;theories of all the forces except gravity:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2010-47-03/S0273-0979-10-01294-2/home.html">The algebra of grand unified theories</a>.</p>
<p>The arbitrary-looking collection of elementary particles we observe in nature turns out to contain secret patterns&#8212;patterns that jump into sharp focus using some modern algebra!  Why do quarks have weird fractional charges like 2/3 and -1/3?  Why does each generation of particles contain two quarks and two leptons?   I can&#8217;t say we really know the answer to such questions, but the math of grand unified theories make these strange facts seem natural and inevitable.  </p>
<p>The math turns out to involve rotations in 10 dimensions, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor">&#8216;spinors&#8217;</a>: things that only come around back to the way they started after you turn them around twice.  This turned out to be a great preparation for our later work.  </p>
<p>As we wrote this article, I realized that John Huerta had a gift for mathematical prose.  In fact, we recently <a href="http://ucrtoday.ucr.edu/10959">won a prize</a> for this paper!  In two weeks we&#8217;ll meet at the big annual American Mathematical Society conference and pick it up.</p>
<p>John Huerta wound up becoming an expert on the octonions, and writing his thesis about how they make superstring theory possible in 10-dimensional spacetime:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.3385">Division algebras, supersymmetry and higher gauge theory</a>.</p>
<p>The wonderful fact is that string theory works well in 10 dimensions because the octonions are 8-dimensional!   Suppose that at each moment in time, a string is like a closed loop.  Then as time passes, it traces out a 2-dimensional sheet in spacetime, called a <b>worldsheet</b>:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/string_worldsheet.jpg" /></div>
<p>In this picture, &#039;up&#039; means &#039;forwards in time&#039;.  Unfortunately this picture is just 3-dimensional: the real story happens in 10 dimensions!  Don&#039;t bother trying to visualize 10 dimensions, just count: in 10-dimensional spacetime there are 10 &#8211; 2 = 8 <i>extra</i> dimensions besides those of the string&#8217;s worldsheet.  These are the directions in which the string can vibrate.  Since the octonions are 8-dimensional, we can describe the string&#8217;s vibrations using octonions!  The algebraic magic of this number system then lets us cook up a beautiful equation describing these vibrations: an equation that has &#8216;supersymmetry&#8217;.</p>
<p>For a full explanation, read John Huerta&#8217;s thesis.  But for an easy overview, read this paper we published in <i>Scientific American</i>:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/octonions/strangest.html">The strangest numbers in string theory</a>.</p>
<p>This got included in a collection called <i><a href="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9821.html">The Best Writing on Mathematics 2012</a></i>, further confirming my opinion that collaborating with John Huerta was a good idea.</p>
<p>Anyway: string theory sounds fancy, but for many years I&#8217;d been tantalized by the relationship between the octonions and a much more prosaic physics problem: a ball rolling on another ball.  I had a lot of clues saying these should be a nice relationship&#8230; though only if we work with a mutant version of the octonions called the &#8216;split&#8217; octonions.  </p>
<p>You probably know how we get the complex numbers by taking the ordinary real numbers and throwing in a square root of -1.  But there&#8217;s also another number system, far less popular but still interesting, called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-complex_number">split complex numbers</a>.  Here we throw in a square root of 1 instead.  Of course 1 already has two square roots, namely 1 and -1.  But that doesn&#8217;t stop us from throwing in another!</p>
<p>This &#8216;split&#8217; game, which is a lot more profound than it sounds at first, also works for the quaternions and octonions.  We get the octonions by starting with the real numbers and throwing in seven square roots of -1, for a total of 8 dimensions.   For the split octonions, we start with the real numbers and throw in three square roots of -1 and four square roots of 1.   The split octonions are surprisingly similar to the octonions.  There are tricks to go back and forth between the two, so you should think of them as two forms of the same underlying thing.</p>
<p>Anyway: I really liked the idea of finding the split octonions lurking in a concrete physics problem like a ball rolling on another ball.  I hoped maybe this could shed some new light on what the octonions are really all about.</p>
<p>James Dolan and I tried hard to get it to work.  We made a lot of progress, but then we got stuck, because we didn&#8217;t realize it only works when one ball is <i>3 times as big as the other!</i>  That was just too crazy for us to guess.</p>
<p>In fact, some mathematicians had known about this for a long time.   Things would have gone a lot faster if I&#8217;d read more papers early on.   By the time we caught up with the experts, I&#8217;d left for Singapore, and John Huerta, still back in Riverside, was the one talking with James Dolan about this stuff.  They figured out a lot more.  </p>
<p>Then Huerta got his Ph.D. and took a job in Australia, which is as close to Singapore as it is to almost anything.  I got a grant from the Foundational Questions Institute to bring John to Singapore and figure out more stuff about the octonions and physics&#8230; and we wound up writing a paper about the rolling ball problem:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.2447">G<sub>2</sub> and the rolling ball</a>.</p>
<p>Whoops!   I haven&#8217;t introduced G<sub>2</sub> yet.   It&#8217;s one of those &#8216;exceptional groups&#8217; I mentioned: the smallest one, in fact.  Like the octonions themselves, this group comes in a few different but closely related &#8216;forms&#8217;.   The most famous form is the symmetry group of the octonions.  But in our paper, we&#8217;re more interested in the &#8216;split&#8217; form, which is the symmetry group of the split octonions.   The reason is that this group is also the symmetry group of a ball rolling without slipping or twisting on another ball that&#8217;s exactly 3 times as big!   </p>
<p>The fact that the same group shows up as the symmetries of these two different things is a huge clue that they&#8217;re deeply related.  The challenge is to understand the relationship.</p>
<p>There are two parts to this challenge.  One is to describe the rolling ball problem in terms of split octonions.  The other is to reverse the story, and somehow get the split octonions to emerge naturally from the study of a rolling ball!  </p>
<p>In our paper we tackled both parts.  Describing the rolling ball problem using split octonions had already been done by other mathematicians, for example here:</p>
<p>&bull; Robert Bryant and Lucas Hsu, <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.46.7262">Rigidity of integral curves of rank 2 distributions</a>.</p>
<p>&bull; Gil Bor and Richard Montgomery, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0612469">G<sub>2</sub> and the &#8220;rolling distribution&#8221;</a>.</p>
<p>&bull; Andrei Agrachev, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0611812">Rolling balls and octonions</a>.</p>
<p>&bull; Aroldo Kaplan, <a href="http://www.scielo.org.ar/scielo.php?pid=S0041-69322008000200006&amp;script=sci_arttext">Quaternions and octonions in mechanics</a>. </p>
<p>We do however give a simpler explanation of why this description only works when one ball is 3 times as big as the other.  </p>
<p>The other part, getting the split octonions to show up starting from the rolling ball problem, seems to be new to us.  We show that in a certain sense, <i>quantizing</i> the rolling ball gives the split octonions!  Very roughly, split octonions can been as quantum states of the rolling ball.  </p>
<p>At this point I&#8217;ve gone almost as far as I can without laying on some heavy math.  In theory I <i>could</i> show you pretty animations of a little ball rolling on a big one, and use these to illustrate the special thing that happens when the big one is 3 times as big.  In theory I <i>might</i> be able to explain the whole story without many equations or much math jargon.  That would be lots of fun&#8230; </p>
<p>&#8230; for you.   But it would be a huge amount of work for me.  So at this point, to make my job easier, I want to turn up the math level a notch or two.  And this is a good point for both of us take a little break.   </p>
<p>In the next and final post in this series, I&#8217;ll sketch how the problem of a little ball rolling on a big stationary ball can be described using split octonions&#8230; and why the symmetries of this problem give a group that&#8217;s the split form of G<sub>2</sub>&#8230; <i>if the big ball has a radius that&#8217;s 3 times the radius of the little one!</i>  </p>
<p>I will not quantize the rolling ball problem&#8212;for that, you&#8217;ll need to read <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.2447">our paper</a>.</p>

			<div class="textwidget"><p>You can <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics">include math in your comments using LaTeX</a>,  but you need to do it this way:</p>
<p>&#036;latex  E = mc^2&#036;</p>
<p>You need the word 'latex' right after the first dollar sign, and it needs a space after it.  Double dollar signs don't work, and other limitations apply, some described <a href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/latex/">here</a>.  You can't preview comments here, but I'm happy to fix errors.</p>
