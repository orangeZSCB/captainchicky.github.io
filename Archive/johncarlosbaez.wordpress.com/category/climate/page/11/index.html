<div align="center">

<img src="https://i0.wp.com/media.npr.org/assets/img/2011/12/31/anybot_custom.jpg" /></a>
</div>
<p>My talk will be about &#8220;Energy, the Environment and What We Can Do.&#8221;  Since I think we should cut unnecessary travel, I decided to stay here in Singapore and use a telepresence robot instead of flying to California.</p>
<p>I thank <a href="http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~mike/">Mike Stay</a> for arranging this at Google, and I especially thank <a href="http://tlb.org/">Trevor Blackwell</a> and everyone else at <a href="https://www.anybots.com/">Anybots</a> for letting me use one of their robots! </p>
<p>I believe Google will film this event and make a video available.  But I hope reporters attend, because it should be fun, and I plan to describe some ways we can slash carbon emissions.</p>
<p>More detail: I will give this talk at 4 pm Monday, February 13, 2012 in the Paramaribo Room on the Google campus (Building 42, Floor 2).  Visitors and reporters are invited, but they need to check in at the main visitor&#8217;s lounge in Building 43, and they&#8217;ll need to be escorted to and from the talk, so someone will pick them up 10 or 15 minutes before the talk starts.</p>
<p><b>Energy, the Environment and What We Can Do</b></p>
<blockquote><p> <b>Abstract:</b> Our heavy reliance on fossil fuels is causing two serious problems: global warming, and the decline of cheaply available oil reserves. Unfortunately the second problem will not cancel out the first. Each one individually seems extremely hard to solve, and taken<br />
together they demand a major worldwide effort starting now. After an overview of these problems, we turn to the question: what can we do about them?
</p></blockquote>
<p>I also need help from all of you reading this!  I want to talk about <i>solutions</i>, not just problems&#8212;and given my audience, and the political deadlock in the US, I especially want to talk about innovative solutions that come from individuals and companies, not governments.</p>
<p>Can changing whole systems produce massive cuts in carbon emissions, in a way that spreads virally rather than being imposed through top-down directives?  It&#8217;s possible.  <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Curtis+Faith">Curtis Faith</a> has some inspiring thoughts on this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
I&#8217;ve been looking on various transportation and energy and environment issues for more than 5 years, and almost no one gets the idea that we can radically reduce consumption if we look at the complete systems. In economic terms, we currently have a suboptimal Nash Equilibrium with a diminishing pie when an optimal expanding pie equilibrium is possible. Just tossing around ideas a a very high level with back of the envelope estimates we can get orders of magnitude improvements with systemic changes that will make people&#8217;s lives better if we can loosen up the grip of the big corporations and government.</p>
<p>  To borrow a physics analogy, the Nash Equilibrium is a bit like a multi-dimensional metastable state where the system is locked into a high energy configuration and any local attempts to make the change revert to the higher energy configuration locally, so it would require sufficient energy or energy in exactly the right form to move all the different metastable states off their equilibrium either simultaneously or in a cascade.</p>
<p>  Ideally, we find the right set of systemic economic changes that can have a cascade effect, so that they are locally systemically optimal and can compete more effectively within the larger system where the Nash Equilibrium dominates. I hope I haven&#8217;t mixed up too many terms from too many fields and confused things. These terms all have overlapping and sometimes very different meaning in the different contexts as I&#8217;m sure is true even within math and science.</p>
<p>  One great example is transportation. We assume we need electric cars or biofuel or some such thing. But the very assumption that a car is necessary is flawed. Why do people want cars? Give them a better alternative and they&#8217;ll stop wanting cars. Now, what that might be? Public transportation? No. All the money spent building a 2,000 kg vehicle to accelerate and decelerate a few hundred kg and then to replace that vehicle on a regular basis can be saved if we eliminate the need for cars.</p>
<p>  The best alternative to cars is walking, or walking on inclined pathways up and down so we get exercise. Why don&#8217;t people walk? Not because they don&#8217;t want to but because our cities and towns have optimized for cars. Create walkable neighborhoods and give people jobs near their home and you eliminate the need for cars. I live in Savannah, GA in a very tiny place. I never use the car. Perhaps 5 miles a week. And even that wouldn&#8217;t be necessary with the right supplemental business structures to provide services more efficiently.</p>
<p>  Or electricity for A/C. Everyone lives isolated in structures that are very inefficient to heat. Large community structures could be air conditioned naturally using various techniques and that could cut electricity demand by 50% for neighborhoods. Shade trees are better than insulation.</p>
<p>  Or how about moving virtually entire cities to cooler climates during the hot months? That is what people used to do. Take a train North for the summer. If the destinations are low-resource destinations, this can be a huge reduction for the city. Again, getting to this state is hard without changing a lot of parts together.</p>
<p>  These problems are not technical, or political, they are economic. We need the economic systems that support these alternatives. People want them. We&#8217;ll all be happier and use far less resources (and money). The economic system needs to be changed, and that isn&#8217;t going to happen with politics, it will happen with economic innovation. We tend to think of our current models as the way things are, but they aren&#8217;t. Most of the status quo is comprised of human inventions, money, fractional reserve banking, corporations, etc. They all brought specific improvements that made them more effective at the time they were introduce because of the conditions during those times. Our times too are different. Some new models will work much better for solving our current problems.</p>
<p>  Your idea really starts to address the reason why people fly unnecessarily. This change in perspective is important. What if we went back to sailing ships? And instead of flying we took long leisurely educational seminar cruises on modern versions of sail yachts? What if we improved our trains? But we need to start from scratch and design new systems so they work together effectively. Why are we stuck with models of cities based on the 19th-century norms?</p>
<p>  We aren&#8217;t, but too many people think we are because the scope of their job or academic career is just the piece of a system, not the system itself.</p>
<p>  System level design thinking is the key to making the difference we need. Changes to the complete systems can have order of magnitude improvements. Changes to the parts will have us fighting for tens of percentages.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Do you know good references on ideas like this&#8212;preferably <i>with actual numbers?</i>  I&#8217;ve done some research, but I feel I must be missing a lot of things.</p>
<p>This book, for example, is interesting:</p>
<p>&bull; Michael Peters, Shane Fudge and Tim Jackson, editors, <i>Low Carbon Communities: Imaginative Approaches to Combating Climate Change Locally</i>, Edward Elgar Publishing Group, Cheltenham, UK, 2010.</p>
<p>but I wish it had more numbers on how much carbon emissions were cut by some of the projects they describe: <a href="http://www.echoaction.net/">Energy Conscious Households in Action</a>, the <a href="http://hadlowcc.wordpress.com/">HadLOW CARBON Community</a>, the <a href="http://www.transitionnetwork.org/">Transition Network</a>, and so on.  </p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Happy New Year!  I&#8217;m <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/diary/december_2011.html">back from Laos</a>.  Here are seven items, mostly from the Azimuth Circle on Google Plus:</p>
<p><b>1)</b> Phil Libin is the boss of a Silicon Valley startup.  When he&#8217;s off travelling, he uses a telepresence robot to keep an eye on things. It looks like a stick figure on wheels.  Its bulbous head has two eyes, which are actually a camera and a laser. On its forehead is a screen, where you can see Libin&#8217;s face.  It&#8217;s made by a company called <a href="https://www.anybots.com/">Anybots</a>, and it costs just $15,000.</p>

</div>
<p>I predict that within my life we&#8217;ll be using things like this to radically cut travel costs and carbon emissions for business and for conferences.  It seems weird now, but so did telephones.    Future models will be better to look at.  But let&#8217;s try it soon!</p>

<p>Bruce Bartlett and I are already planning for me to use telepresence to give a lecture on mathematics and the environment at Stellenbosch University in South Africa.  But we&#8217;d been planning to use old-fashioned videoconferencing technology.  </p>
<p>Anybots is located in Mountain View, California.  That&#8217;s near Google&#8217;s main campus.  <b>Can anyone help me set up a talk on energy and the environment at Google, where I use an Anybot?</b>  </p>
<p>(Or, for that matter, anywhere else around there?)</p>
<p><b>2)</b> A study claims to have found a correlation between weather and the day of the week!  The claim is that there are more tornados and hailstorms in the eastern USA during weekdays.  One possible mechanism could be that aerosols from car exhaust help seed clouds.  </p>
<div align="center">

</div>
<p>I make no claims that this study is correct.  But at the very least, it would be interesting to examine their use of statistics and see if it&#8217;s convincing or flawed:</p>
<p>&bull; Thomas Bell and Daniel Rosenfeld, <a href="http://earth.huji.ac.il/data/file/danny/128_Bell_JGR-2011.pdf">Why do tornados and hailstorms rest on weekends?</a>, Journal of Geophysical Research <b>116</b> (2011), D20211.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Abstract.</b> This study shows for the first time statistical evidence that when anthropogenic aerosols over the eastern United States during summertime are at their weekly mid-week peak, tornado and hailstorm activity there is also near its weekly maximum. The weekly cycle in summertime storm activity for 1995–2009 was found to be statistically significant and unlikely to be due to natural variability. It correlates well with previously observed weekly cycles of other measures of storm activity. The pattern of variability supports the hypothesis that air pollution aerosols invigorate deep convective clouds in a moist, unstable atmosphere, to the extent of inducing production of large hailstones and tornados. This is caused by the effect of aerosols on cloud drop nucleation, making cloud drops smaller and hydrometeors larger. According to simulations, the larger ice hydrometeors contribute to more hail. The reduced evaporation from the larger hydrometeors produces weaker cold pools. Simulations have shown that too cold and fast-expanding pools inhibit the formation of tornados. The statistical observations suggest that this might be the mechanism by which the weekly modulation in pollution aerosols is causing the weekly cycle in severe convective storms during summer over the eastern United States. Although we focus here on the role of aerosols, they are not a primary atmospheric driver of tornados and hailstorms but rather modulate them in certain conditions.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s a discussion of it:</p>
<p>&bull; Bob Yirka, <a href="http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-12-thunderstorms-tornados-prevalent-weekends.html">New research may explain why serious thunderstorms and tornados are less prevalent on the weekends</a>, <i>PhysOrg</i>, 22 December 2011.</p>
<p><b>3)</b> And if you like to check how people use statistics, here&#8217;s a paper that would be incredibly important <i>if its findings were correct:</i></p>
<p>&bull; Joseph J. Mangano and Janette D. Sherman, <a href="http://janettesherman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/122011_IJHS_Article_42-1F.pdf">An unexpected mortality increase in the United States follows arrival of the radioactive plume from Fukushima: is there a correlation?</a>, <i>International Journal of Health Services</i> <b>42</b> (2012), 47–64.</p>
<p>The title has a question mark in it, but it&#8217;s been cited in very dramatic terms in many places, for example this video entitled &#8220;Peer reviewed study shows 14,000 U.S. deaths from Fukushima&#8221;:</p>
<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bdow_6pN6jY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span>
<p>Starting at 1:31 you&#8217;ll see an interview with one of the paper&#8217;s authors, <a href="http://janettesherman.com/">Janette Sherman</a>.</p>
<p>14,000 deaths in the US due to Fukushima? Wow!  How did they get that figure?  This quote from the paper explains how:</p>
<blockquote><p>
During weeks 12 to 25 [after the Fukushima disaster began], total deaths in 119 U.S. cities increased from 148,395 (2010) to 155,015 (2011), or 4.46 percent. This was nearly double the 2.34 percent rise in total deaths (142,006 to 145,324) in 104 cities for the prior 14 weeks, significant at p &lt; 0.000001 (Table 2). This difference between actual and expected changes of +2.12 percentage points (+4.46% – 2.34%) translates to 3,286 “excess” deaths (155,015 × 0.0212) nationwide. Assuming a total of 2,450,000 U.S. deaths will occur in 2011 (47,115 per week), then 23.5 percent of deaths are reported (155,015/14 = 11,073, or 23.5% of 47,115). Dividing 3,286 by 23.5 percent yields a projected 13,983 excess U.S. deaths in weeks 12 to 25 of 2011.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Hmm.  Can you think of some potential problems with this analysis?</p>
<p>In the interview, Janette Sherman also mentions increased death rates of children in British Columbia.  Here&#8217;s the evidence the paper presents for that:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Shortly after the report [another paper by the authors] was issued, officials from British Columbia, Canada, proximate to the northwestern United States, announced that 21 residents had died of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in the first half of 2011, compared with 16 SIDS deaths in all of the prior year. Moreover, the number of deaths from SIDS rose from 1 to 10 in the months of March, April, May, and June 2011, after Fukushima fallout arrived, compared with the same period in 2010. While officials could not offer any explanation for the abrupt increase, it coincides with our findings in the Pacific Northwest.

<p><b>7)</b>  Finally, here&#8217;s a cool picture taken in the Gulf of Alaska by <a href="http://www.watchonepiecepoint.com/2011/05/a-photo-of-ocean-borders/">Kent Smith</a>:</p>

<p>He believes this was caused by fresher water meeting more salty water, but it doesn&#8217;t sounds like he&#8217;s sure.  Can anyone figure out what&#8217;s going on?  The foam where the waters meet is especially intriguing.</p>

<p>Melting permafrost is in the news!  Check out this great slide show and article:</p>
<p>&bull; Josh Hane, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2011/12/11/us/PERMAFROST-13.html">Hunting for clues to global warming</a>, <i>New York Times</i>, 16 December 2011.</p>

<p>They track <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katey_Walter">Katey M. Walter Anthony</a>, an assistant professor at the <a href="http://ine.uaf.edu/werc/people/katey-walter-anthony/">Water and Environmental Research Center</a> at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, as she studies methane bubbling up from lakes&#8212;as shown above.</p>

<p>These lakes form in an interesting way.  Permafrost is permanently frozen soil lying beneath a layer 0.6 to 4 meters thick of soil that thaws in the summer and refreezes in the winter: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_layer"><b>active layer</b></a>.  The permafrost itself can be much thicker&#8212;up to 1500 meters in parts of Siberia!  </p>

<p>As far as I can tell, <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talik">talik</a></b> is permanently unfrozen soil on top of, amid or beneath the permafrost.  </p>
<p>Permafrost is rock-hard and solid.  Liquid water does not pass through it, so permafrost environments tend to be poorly drained and boggy.  But when permafrost starts to melt, it becomes soft.   Soil sinks down into marshy hollows separated by small hills, forming a kind of terrain called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermokarst"><b>thermokarst</b></a>.</p>

<p>On flat ground, melted water can pool into a <b>thermokarst lake</b>.   On slopes, water pours downhill and the land can rip open in a <b>thermokarst failure</b>.

<p>All these are natural processes that are widespread at the end of each glacial period.  Here&#8217;s a surprisingly delightful book which discusses this in detail:</p>
<p>&bull; Evelyn C. Pielou, <i>After the Ice Age: the Return of Life to Glaciated North America</i>, U. Chicago Press, Chicago, 1991. </p>
<p>So, please don&#8217;t misunderstand: I&#8217;m <i>not</i> trying to say that thermokarst lakes, drunken forests and the like are signs of disaster.  However, as the Earth warms, new regions of permafrost are melting, and we&#8217;ll see these phenomena in new regions.  We need to understand how they work, and the positive and negative feedbacks.  For example, thermokarst lakes are darker than their surroundings, so they absorb more sunlight and warm the area.</p>
<p>Most importantly, as permafrost thaws, it releases trapped carbon in the form of carbon dioxide and methane, which are both greenhouse gases.  Since there are <a href="http://www.lter.uaf.edu/dev2009/pdf/1350_Tarnocai_Canadell_2009.pdf">roughly 1.7 trillion tons of carbon in northern soils, with about 90% locked in permafrost</a>, that&#8217;s a big deal.   </p>
<p>At least once so far, the tundra has even caught fire:</p>
<blockquote><p>
One day in 2007, on the plain in northern Alaska, a lightning strike set the tundra on fire.</p>
<p>Historically, tundra, a landscape of lichens, mosses and delicate plants, was too damp to burn. But the climate in the area is warming and drying, and fires in both the tundra and forest regions of Alaska are increasing.</p>
<p>The Anaktuvuk River fire burned about 400 square miles of tundra, and work on lake sediments showed that <a href="http://www.wildfirepire.org/sites/default/files/hu_2010_tundra_burning_in_alaska_linkages_to_climatic_change_and_sea_ice_retreat.pdf">no fire of that scale had occurred in the region in at least 5,000 years</a>.</p>
<p>Scientists have calculated that the fire and its aftermath sent a huge pulse of carbon into the air — as much as would be emitted in two years by a city the size of Miami. Scientists say the fire thawed the upper layer of permafrost and set off what they fear will be permanent shifts in the landscape.</p>
<p>Up to now, the Arctic has been absorbing carbon, on balance, and was once expected to keep doing so throughout this century. But recent analyses suggest that the permafrost thaw could turn the Arctic into a net source of carbon, possibly within a decade or two, and those studies did not account for fire.</p>
<p>“I maintain that the fastest way you’re going to lose permafrost and release permafrost carbon to the atmosphere is increasing fire frequency,” said <a href="http://people.biology.ufl.edu/mcmack/macklab/people.html">Michelle C. Mack</a>, a University of Florida scientist who is <a href="http://www.indiaenvironmentportal.org.in/files/file/wildfires.pdf">studying the Anaktuvuk fire</a>. “It’s a rapid and catastrophic way you could completely change everything.”

					<p>This summer a Russian research ship found hundreds of plumes of methane, &#8220;of a fantastic scale&#8221;, bubbling up from the sea floor off the East Siberian coast:</p>

</div>
<p>Here are the quotes with actual new information:</p>
<blockquote><p>
In late summer, the Russian research vessel Academician Lavrentiev conducted an extensive survey of about 10,000 square miles of sea off the East Siberian coast. Scientists deployed four highly sensitive instruments, both seismic and acoustic, to monitor the &#8220;fountains&#8221; or plumes of methane bubbles rising to the sea surface from beneath the seabed.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a very small area, less than 10,000 square miles, we have counted more than 100 fountains, or torch-like structures, bubbling through the water column and injected directly into the atmosphere from the seabed,&#8221; Dr Semiletov said. &#8220;We carried out checks at about 115 stationary points and discovered methane fields of a fantastic scale – I think on a scale not seen before. Some plumes were a kilometre or more wide and the emissions went directly into the atmosphere – the concentration was a hundred times higher than normal.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;This is the first time that we&#8217;ve found continuous, powerful and impressive seeping structures, more than 1,000 metres in diameter. It&#8217;s amazing,&#8221; Dr Semiletov said. &#8220;I was most impressed by the sheer scale and high density of the plumes. Over a relatively small area we found more than 100, but over a wider area there should be thousands of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scientists estimate that there are hundreds of millions of tonnes of methane gas locked away beneath the Arctic permafrost, which extends from the mainland into the seabed of the relatively shallow sea of the East Siberian Arctic Shelf. One of the greatest fears is that with the disappearance of the Arctic sea-ice in summer, and rapidly rising temperatures across the entire region, which are already melting the Siberian permafrost, the trapped methane could be suddenly released into the atmosphere leading to rapid and severe climate change.</p>
<p>Dr Semiletov&#8217;s team published a study in 2010 estimating that the methane emissions from this region were about eight million tonnes a year, but the latest expedition suggests this is a significant underestimate of the phenomenon.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;d like to know more about <a href="http://www.iarc.uaf.edu/people/igorsm">Igor Semiletov&#8217;s</a> work and what he&#8217;s just found.  He was mentioned in this earlier very good article:</p>
<p>&bull; Amanda Leigh Mascarelli, <a href="http://www.nature.com/climate/2009/0904/full/climate.2009.24.html">A sleeping giant?</a>, <i>Nature Reports Climate Change</i>, 5 March 2009.</p>
<p>Namely:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The Siberian Shelf alone harbours an estimated 1,400 billion tonnes of methane in gas hydrates, about twice as much carbon as is contained in all the trees, grasses and flowers on the planet. If just one per cent of this escaped into the atmosphere within a few decades, it would be enough to cause abrupt climate change, says Shakhova. &#8220;When hydrates are destabilized, gas is released under very high pressure,&#8221; she says. &#8220;So emissions could be massive and non-gradual.&#8221; <b>Shakhova and her colleague Igor Semiletov of the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, believe the plumes they&#8217;ve observed confirm previous reports that the permafrost cap is beginning to destabilize, allowing methane to escape from the frozen hydrates below.</b> &#8220;Subsea permafrost is like a rock,&#8221; explains Semiletov. &#8220;It works like a lid to prevent escape of any gas. We believe that the subsea permafrost is failing to seal the ancient carbon pool.&#8221; </p>
<p>But Carolyn Ruppel, a geophysicist with the US Geological Survey in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, isn&#8217;t yet ready to attribute the methane plumes to a breakdown in methane hydrates in the subsea permafrost. &#8220;We have proof from studies that have been carried out in the past few years that there&#8217;s a lot of methane in certain shallow marine environments offshore in the Arctic,&#8221; says Ruppel. &#8220;But can we prove that the methane comes from methane hydrates? That is a critical question.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Why is it critical?  Because people are worried about global warming melting <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/09/01/melting-permafrost/">permafrost</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane_clathrate">gas hydrates</a> on the ocean floor.  Suppose these release large amounts of methane, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas#Global_warming_potential">greenhouse gas vastly more potent than carbon dioxide</a>.  This will then makes the Earth even warmer, and so on: we have a feedback loop.  In a real nightmare scenario, we could imagine that this feedback actually leads to a &#8216;tipping point&#8217;, where the climate flips over to a much warmer state.  And in the worst nightmare of all, we can imagine something like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleocene%E2%80%93Eocene_Thermal_Maximum">Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum</a>, a spike of heat that lasted about 20,000 years, causing significant extinctions.</p>
<p>Are any of these nightmares really possible?  I wrote about this question before, assembling what facts I could easily find:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/09/01/melting-permafrost/">Melting permafrost (Part 1)</a>.</p>
<p>How much new light does Semiletov&#8217;s work shed on this question?</p>
<p>Luckily, a team of scientists is gearing up to answer it:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.biology.ufl.edu/permafrostcarbon/index.html">Permafrost Carbon Network (RCN)</a>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a paper by this team:</p>
<p>&bull; Edward A. G. Schuur, Benjamin Abbott and the Permafrost Carbon Network, <a href="http://www.lter.uaf.edu/pdf/1562_Schuur_Abbott_2011.pdf">High risk of permafrost thaw</a>, <i><a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v480/n7375/full/480032a.html">Nature</a></i> <b>480</b> (1 December 2011), 32-33.</p>
<p>To get the ball rolling, they surveyed themselves. That may seem like a lazy way to write a paper, but I don&#8217;t mind it as a quick way to get a sense of the conventional wisdom&#8230; and they probably wanted to do it just to find out what they all thought!  Here are the results&#8212;emphasis mine:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Our survey asks what percentage of the surface permafrost is likely to thaw, how much carbon will be released, and how much of that carbon will be CH<sub>4</sub>, for three time periods and under four warming scenarios that will be part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report. The lowest warming scenario projects 1.5 °C Arctic warming over the 1985–2004 average by the year 2040, ramping up to 2 °C by 2100; the highest warming scenario considers 2.5 °C by 2040, and 7.5 °C by 2100. In all cases, we posited that the temperature would remain steady from 2100 to 2300 so that we could assess opinions about the time lag in the response of permafrost carbon to temperature change.</p>
<p>The survey was filled out this year by 41 international scientists, listed as authors here, who publish on various aspects of permafrost. The results are striking. <b>Collectively, we hypothesize that the high warming scenario will degrade 9–15% of the top 3 metres of permafrost by 2040, increasing to 47–61% by 2100 and 67–79% by 2300 (these ranges are the 95% confidence intervals around the group’s mean estimate). The estimated carbon release from this degradation is 30 billion to 63 billion tonnes of carbon by 2040, reaching 232 billion to 380 billion tonnes by 2100 and 549 billion to 865 billion tonnes by 2300. These values, expressed in CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents, combine the effect of carbon released as both CO<sub>2</sub> and as CH<sub>4</sub>.</b></p>
<p>Our estimate for the amount of carbon released by 2100 is 1.7–5.2 times larger than those reported in several recent modelling studies, all of which used a similar warming scenario. This reflects, in part, our perceived importance of the abrupt thaw processes, as well as our heightened awareness of deep carbon pools. Active research is aimed at incorporating these main issues, along with others, into models.</p>
<p>Are our projected rapid changes to the permafrost soil carbon pool plausible? The survey predicts a 7–11% drop in the size of the permafrost carbon pool by 2100 under the high-warming scenario. That scale of carbon loss has happened before: a 7–14% decrease has been measured in soil carbon inventories across thousands of sites in the temperate-zone United Kingdom as a result of climate change. Also, data scaled up from a single permafrost field site point to a potential 5% loss over a century as a result of widespread permafrost thaw. These field results generally agree with the collective carbon-loss projection made by this survey, so it should indeed be plausible.</p>
<p>Across all the warming scenarios, we project that most of the released carbon will be in the form of CO<sub>2</sub> with only about 2.7% in the form of CH<sub>4</sub>. However, because CH<sub>4</sub> has a higher global-warming potential, almost half the effect of future permafrost-zone carbon emissions on climate forcing is likely to be from CH<sub>4</sub>. That is roughly consistent with the tens of billions of tonnes of CH<sub>4</sub> thought to have come from oxygen-limited environments in northern ecosystems after the end of the last glacial period.</p>
<p>All this points towards significant carbon releases from permafrost-zone soils over policy-relevant timescales. It also highlights important lags whereby permafrost degradation and carbon emissions are expected to continue for decades or centuries after global temperatures stabilize at new, higher levels. Of course, temperatures might not reach such high levels. Our group’s estimate for carbon release under the lowest warming scenario, although still quite sizeable, is about one-third of that predicted under the strongest warming scenario.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I found this sentence is a bit confusing: </p>
<blockquote><p>These values, expressed in CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents, combine the effect of carbon released as both CO<sub>2</sub> and as CH<sub>4</sub>.</p></blockquote>
<p>But I guess that combined with a guess like &#8220;30 billion to 63 billion tonnes of carbon by 2040&#8221;, it means that they&#8217;re expecting a release of carbon dioxide and methane that&#8217;s equal, in its global warming potential, to what you&#8217;d get from burning 30 to 63 billion tonnes of carbon, turning it <i>all</i> into carbon dioxide, and releasing it into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>For comparison, <a href="http://www.iea.org/index_info.asp?id=1959">in 2010 humanity burnt 8.3 billion tonnes of carbon</a>.  So, at least up to 2040, I guess they&#8217;re expecting the effect of melting permafrost to be roughly 1/8 to 1/4 of the direct effect of burning carbon.    </p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Devoted readers will remember my interview of Nathan Urban in <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week302.html">week302</a>&#8212;<a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week305.html">week305</a> of This Week&#8217;s Finds.  We talked about how he estimated the probability that global warming will cause the biggest current in the North Atlantic to collapse.</p>
<p>Now he and a bunch of coauthors have a new paper using paleoclimate data and some of the same mathematical techniques to estimate of how much the Earth will warm if we double the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere:</p>
<p>&bull; A. Schmittner, N.M. Urban, J.D. Shakun, N.D. Mahowald, P.U. Clark, P.J. Bartlein, A.C. Mix and A. Rosell-Melé, <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~nurban/pubs/lgm-cs-uvic.pdf">Climate sensitivity estimated from temperature  reconstructions of the last glacial maximum</a>, <i><a href="http://newscience.planet3.org/2011/11/24/interview-with-nathan-urban-on-his-new-paper-climate-sensitivity-estimated-from-temperature-reconstructions-of-the-last-glacial-maximum/">Science</a></i>, 2011.</p>
<p>The average global temperature rise when we double the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere is called the <b>climate sensitivity</b>.</p>
<p>The paper claims that the “likely” (66% probability) climate sensitivity is between 1.7 and 2.6 °C.  They say it&#8217;s &#8220;very likely&#8221; (90% probability) that the climate sensitivity is between 1.4 and 2.8 °C.   Their best estimate is around 2.2 or 2.3 °C.  </p>
<p>If true, this is good news, because other studies suggest 3 °C as the best estimate, 2 to 4.5 °C as the &#8220;very likely&#8221; range, and a chance of even higher figures.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Nathan and his collaborators predict a significantly higher climate sensitivity <i>on land</i>.  Here&#8217;s a graph of the probability density for various possible values</p>
<div align="center">

<img src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/nathan_urban_climate_sensitivity.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>As you can see, their analysis easily allows for warming of 3 to 4 °C <i>on land</i> if we double the amount of CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>The best summary of the paper is this new interview of Nathan Urban by the blogger &#8216;thingsbreak&#8217;:</p>

					<p>As I was reading about global warming and its effect on the Arctic and the people who live there, I couldn&#8217;t help bumping into some words in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenlandic_language">West Greenlandic</a>.   This is the main Inuit language spoken in Greenland.  The people who actually speak it call it &#8216;Kalaallisut&#8217;.  In June 2009 it was made the official language of the Greenlandic autonomous territory.</p>
<p>For example, I read about Sermersuaq.   This is the Northern Hemisphere&#8217;s widest &#8216;tidewater glacier&#8217;: one that begins on land but terminates in water.  It stretches 90 kilometers across!   </p>
<p>This glacier is also called the Humboldt Glacier, but with all due respect to Humboldt, I&#8217;d rather call this magnificent, intensely forbidding realm by the name used by the people who can manage to <i>live there!</i>   And so, I&#8217;d rather use the Kalaallisut word: <b>Sermersuaq</b>.</p>
<p>To see why Sermersuaq is a big deal, check out these photos taken by <a>Nick Cobbing of Greenpeace</a>:</p>

<p>It lost <a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/climate/2009/08/greenlands_glaciers_waking_the.html">175 square kilometers of ice during that time</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, after seeing words like Semersuaq, Kangerdlugssuaq, and so on, I started wondering about a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eskimo_words_for_snow">famous urban legend</a>.  </p>
<p>You&#8217;ve probably heard that the Eskimos have lots of words for snow.  And maybe you&#8217;ve heard other people say  &#8220;no, that&#8217;s not true&#8221;.  </p>
<p>But the whole dispute starts seeming rather silly when you find out that the Eskimo &mdash; or more precisely, the speakers of Kalaallisut &mdash; have a word for &#8220;once again they tried to build a giant radio station, but it was apparently only on the drawing board.&#8221;  It&#8217;s </p>
<p><div align="center">
<b>nalunaarasuartaatilioqateeraliorfinnialikker-<br />
saatiginialikkersaatilillaranatagoorunarsuarooq</b>.</div>
<p>When I learned this, I decided I wanted to learn a bit more about Kalaallisut!  </p>
<p>For starters, Kalaallisut is just one of several closely related <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inuit_languages">Inuit</a> languages spoken in Greenland and Canada.  Here is a map showing these languages:</p>
<p><div align="center">
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inuit_languages"><br />
<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Inuktitut_dialect_map.svg/450px-Inuktitut_dialect_map.svg.png" /></a></div>
<p>In my attempts to learn more, I bumped into this piece:</p>
<p>&bull; Mick Mallon, <a href="http://www.inuktitutcomputing.ca/Technocrats/ILFT_1.html">Inuktitut Linguistics for Technocrats</a>, Ittukuluuk Language Programs, Iqaluit, 2000.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inuktitut">Inuktitut</a>, which is the collective name for a group of Inuit languages spoken in Eastern Canada.  You can see them on the map: they&#8217;re called Qikiqtaaluk nigiani, Nunavimmiutitut, and Nunatsiavummiutut.  </p>
<p>This language is very different from English: it&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysynthetic_language">polysynthetic</a>, meaning that words can be composed of many pieces.  </p>
<p>For example, verbs can be singular, dual, or plural:</p>
<p>takujunga &mdash; I see <br />
takujuguk &mdash; we two see <br />
takujugut &mdash; we several see </p>
<p>But instead of using words like &#8220;because&#8221;, &#8220;if&#8221; or &#8220;whether&#8221;, they use different suffixes:</p>
<p>takugama &mdash; because I see <br />
takugunnuk &mdash; if we two see <br />
takungmangaatta &mdash; whether we several see </p>
<p>The object of the verb can be attached as a suffix:</p>
<p>takujagit &mdash; I see you <br />
takujara &mdash; I see him <br />
takugakku &mdash; because I see him </p>
<p>There are also suffixes that turn verbs to nouns, and suffixes that turn nouns to verbs&#8230; and you can even use <i>both</i> in a single complicated word! </p>
<p>There are also ways to indicate whether something is stationary or moving, expected or unexpected:</p>
<p>tavva! &mdash; Here it is! (stationary and expected) <br />
avva! &mdash; There it is over there! (mobile and unexpected)</p>
<p>There are ways to add spatial information:</p>
<p>tavvani &mdash; at this (expected) spot<br />
maangat &mdash; from this (unexpected) area<br />
tappaunga &mdash; to that (expected) area up there<br />
kanuuna &mdash; through that (unexpected) spot down there</p>
<p>And all this is just scratching the surface!  Words can easily become huge&mdash;and in in a typical written text, only a minority of words are ever repeated.</p>
<p>Whether despite this or because of it, I think we must admit that the Inuit <i>do</i> have a marvelously terse way of describing lots of concepts related to snow and ice.   For example, here&#8217;s a word list taken from <a href="http://www.putlearningfirst.com/language/research/eskimo2.html">Fortescue&#8217;s text on Kalaallisut</a>:</p>

<p>In a semiconductor, a &#8216;hole&#8217; is the absence of an electron, and it can move around a as if it were a particle. If you have a hole moving to the right, in reality you have electrons moving to the left.  Here pink dots moving counterclockwise look like a green dot moving clockwise!  </p>
<p>A related puzzle: what happens when you hold a helium balloon on a string while you&#8217;re driving in a car with the windows closed&#8230; and then you make a sharp right turn?  I&#8217;ve done it, so I know from experience.</p>
<p>Now for the real stuff:</p>
<p>&bull; Tom Murphy, a physics professor at U.C. San Diego, has a blog worth visiting: <a href="http://physics.ucsd.edu/do-the-math/about-this-blog/">Do the Math</a>.  He uses physics and math to make informed guesses about the future of energy production.  Try out his <a href="http://physics.ucsd.edu/do-the-math/2011/11/peak-oil-perspective/">overview on &#8216;peak oil&#8217;</a>.  </p>
<p>&bull; Hundreds of top conservation scientists <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/11/111108195128.htm">took a survey</a>, and 99.5% felt that a serious loss of biodiversity is either &#8216;likely&#8217;, &#8216;very likely&#8217;, or &#8216;virtually certain&#8217;.  Tropical coral ecosystems were perceived as the most seriously affected. A slim majority think we need to decide on rules for &#8216;triage&#8217;: deciding which species to save and which to give up on.</p>
<p>&bull; Climate change is causing a <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/11/111103081431.htm">massive change in tree species across Western USA</a>.  &#8220;Ecosystems are always changing at the landscape level, but normally the rate of change is too slow for humans to notice,&#8221; said Steven Running, a co-author of a study on this at the University of Montana. &#8220;Now the rate of change is fast enough we can see it.&#8221;  The study used remote sensing of large areas over a four-year period.</p>
<p>&bull; The <a href="http://www.jamesdysonaward.org/Prize.aspx">James Dyson Award</a> calls on design and engineering students to create innovative, practical, elegant solutions to the challenges that face us.  This year, Edward Linacre won for a <a href="http://www.jamesdysonaward.org/Projects/Project.aspx?ID=1722&amp;RegionId=0&amp;Winindex=4">self-powering device that extracts water from the air</a> for irrigation purposes.  Linacre comes from the drought-afflicted continent of Australia.  But his invention borrows some tricks from the Namib beetle, which survives some of the driest deserts in Africa by harvesting the moisture that condenses on its back during the early morning.   That&#8217;s called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomimicry">biomimicry</a>.</p>

<p>&bull; The <i>New York Times</i> has a great profile of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/14/magazine/can-jeremy-grantham-profit-from-ecological-mayhem.html?ref=magazine&amp;pagewanted=all">Jeremy Grantham</a>.  He heads a successful firm managing $100 billion assets, and now he&#8217;s 72.  So why is he saying this?  </p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8230; it’s very important to me to make a lot of money now, much more than when I was 40 or 50.
</p></blockquote>
<div align="center"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/14/magazine/can-jeremy-grantham-profit-from-ecological-mayhem.html?ref=magazine&amp;pagewanted=all"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2011/08/14/magazine/14grantham2/14grantham2-articleInline-v2.jpg" /></a>
</div>
<p>Not because he has a brand new gold-digger &#8216;trophy wife&#8217; or spendthrift heirs.  No, he puts all the money into the <a href="http://www.granthamfoundation.org/">Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment</a>.  He&#8217;s famous for his quarterly letters on future trends&#8212;<a href="http://www.gmo.com/America/">you can read them free online!</a>  And thanks to this, he has some detailed ideas about what&#8217;s coming up, and what we should do about it:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Energy “will give us serious and sustained problems” over the next 50 years as we make the transition from hydrocarbons&#8212;oil, coal, gas&#8212;to solar, wind, nuclear and other sources, but we’ll muddle through to a solution to Peak Oil and related challenges. Peak Everything Else will prove more intractable for humanity. Metals, for instance, “are entropy at work . . . from wonderful metal ores to scattered waste,” and scarcity and higher prices “will slowly increase forever,” but if we scrimp and recycle, we can make do for another century before tight constraint kicks in.</p>
<p>Agriculture is more worrisome. Local water shortages will cause “persistent irritation”&#8212;wars, famines. Of the three essential macro nutrient fertilizers, nitrogen is relatively plentiful and recoverable, but we’re running out of potassium and phosphorus, finite mined resources that are “necessary for all life.” Canada has large reserves of potash (the source of potassium), which is good news for Americans, but 50 to 75 percent of the known reserves of phosphate (the source of phosphorus) are located in Morocco and the western Sahara. Assuming a 2 percent annual increase in phosphorus consumption, Grantham believes the rest of the world’s reserves won’t last more than 50 years, so he expects “gamesmanship” from the phosphate-rich.</p>
<p>And he rates soil erosion as the biggest threat of all. The world’s population could reach 10 billion within half a century&#8212;perhaps twice as many human beings as the planet’s overtaxed resources can sustainably support, perhaps six times too many.
</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s not that he doesn&#8217;t take climate change seriously.  However, he seems to have almost given up on the US political establishment doing anything about it.  So he&#8217;s shifted his focus:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Grantham put his own influence and money behind the climate-change bill passed by the House in 2009. “But even $100 million wouldn’t have gotten it through the Senate,” he said. “The recession more or less ruled it out. It pushed anything having to do with the environment down 10 points, across the board. Unemployment and interest in environmental issues move inversely.”</p>
<p>Having missed a once-in-a-generation legislative opportunity to address climate change, American environmentalists are looking for new strategies. Grantham believes that the best approach may be to recast global warming, which depresses crop yields and worsens soil erosion, as a factor contributing to resource depletion. “People are naturally much more responsive to finite resources than they are to climate change,” he said. “Global warming is bad news. Finite resources is investment advice.” He believes this shift in emphasis plays to Americans’ strength. “Americans are just about the worst at dealing with long-term problems, down there with Uzbekistan,” he said, “but they respond to a market signal better than almost anyone. They roll the dice bigger and quicker than most.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Let&#8217;s wrap up with some more fun stuff: impressive volcanos!</p>
<div align="center"><img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/diary/puyehue_volcano_1.jpg" /></div>
<p>Morgan Abbou explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Volcanic lightning photograph by Francisco Negroni. In a scene no human could have witnessed, an apocalyptic agglomeration of lightning bolts illuminates an ash cloud above Chile&#8217;s Puyehue volcano in June 2011. The minutes-long exposure shows individual bolts as if they&#8217;d all occurred at the same moment and, due to the Earth&#8217;s rotation, renders stars (left) as streaks. Lightning to the right of the ash cloud appears to have illuminated nearby clouds.hence the apparent absence of stars on that side of the picture. After an ominous series of earthquakes on the previous day, the volcano erupted that afternoon, convincing authorities to evacuate some 3,500 area residents. Eruptions over the course of the weekend resulted in heavy ashfalls, including in Argentine towns 60 miles (a hundred kilometers) away.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s another shot of the same volcano:</p>

				<h2><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/11/03/apocalypse-retreat-or-revolution/" rel="bookmark">Apocalypse, Retreat or&nbsp;Revolution?</a></h2>
				<small>3 November, 2011</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>I&#8217;ve been enjoying this book:</p>
<p>&bull;  Tim Lenton and Andrew Watson, <i>Revolutions That Made the Earth</i>, Oxford U. Press, Oxford, 2011.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s mainly about the history of life on Earth, and how life has affected the climate and atmosphere.  For example: when photosynthesis first started pumping a deadly toxic gas into the atmosphere&#8212;<i>oxygen</i>&#8212;how did life evolve to avoid disaster?  </p>
<p>Or: why did most of the Earth freeze, about 650 million years ago, and what did life do then?  </p>
<p>Or: what made 96% of all marine species and 70% of vertebrates on land die out, around 250 million years ago?</p>
<p>This is the book&#8217;s strength: a detailed but readable version of the greatest story we know, complete with mysteries yet to be solved.   But at the end they briefly ponder the future.  They consider various scenarios, lumped into three categories: apocalypse, retreat or revolution.  </p>
<h4> Apocalypse </h4>
<p>They begin by reviewing the familiar story: how soaring population and fossil fuel usage is making our climate ever hotter, making our oceans ever more acidic, and sucking phosphorus and other nutrients out of ground and into the sea.</p>
<p>They consider different ways these trends could push the Earth into a new, inhospitable state.  They use the term &#8216;apocalypse&#8217;.  I think &#8216;disaster&#8217; is better, but anyway, they write:</p>
<blockquote><p> Even the normally cheerful and creative Jim Lovelock argues that we are already doomed, and nothing we can do now will stop the Earth system being carried by its own internal dynamics into a different and inhospitable state for us.  If so, all we can do is try to adapt.  We disagree&#8212;in our view the game is not yet up.  As far as we can see no one has yet made a convincing scientific case that we are close to a <i>global</i> tipping point for &#8216;runaway&#8217; climate change. </p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Yet even without truly &#8216;runaway&#8217; change, the combination of unmitigated fossil fuel burning and positive feedbacks from within the Earth system could still produce an apocalyptic climate for humanity.  We could raise global temperature by up to 6 &deg;C this century, with more to come next century.  On the way there, many parts of the Earth system could pas their own thresholds and undergo profound changes in state.  These are what Tim [Lenton] and colleagues have called <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Tipping+point">&#8216;tipping elements&#8217;</a> in the climate system.  </p>
<p>They warrant a book by themselves, so we will just touch on them briefly here.  The tipping elements include the great ice sheets covering Greenland and West Antarctica that are already losing mass and adding to sea level rise.  In the tropics, there are already changes in atmospheric circulation, and in the pattern of El Ni&ntilde;o events.  The Amazon rainforest suffered severe drought in 2005 and might in the future face a climate drying-triggered dieback, destroying biodiversity and adding carbon to the atmosphere.  Over India, an atmospheric brown cloud of pollution is already disrupting the summer monsoon, threatening food security.  The monsoon in West Africa could be seriously disrupted as the neighboring ocean warms up.  The boreal forests that cloak the northern high latitudes are threatened by warming, forest fires and insect infestation.  The list goes on.  The key point is that the Earth&#8217;s climate, being a complex feedback system, is unlikely to respond in an entirely smooth and proportional way to significant changes in energy balance caused by human activities.

<p>Here is a map of some tipping elements.  Click for more details:</p>

<h4>Retreat</h4>
<p>They write:</p>
<blockquote><p>
A popular answer to apocalyptic visions of the future is <i>retreat</i>, into a lower energy, lower material consumption, and ultimately lower population world.  In this future world the objective is to minimize human effects on the Earth system and allow Gaia to reassert herself, with more room for natural ecosystems and minimal intervention in global cycles. The noble aim is long-term sustainability for for people as well as the planet.  </p>
<p>There are some good and useful things we can take from such visions of the future, especially in helping to wean ourselves off fossil fuels, achieve greater energy efficiency, promote recycling and redefine what we mean by quality of life.  However, we think that visions of retreat are hopelessly at odds with current trends, and with the very nature of what drives revolutionary changes of the Earth.  They lack pragmatism and ultimately they lack ambition.  Moreover, a retreat sufficient to forestall the problems outlined above might be just as bad as the problems it sought to avoid.
</p></blockquote>
<h4>Revolution</h4>
<p>They write:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Our alternative vision of the future is of <i>revolution</i>, into a high energy, high recycling world that can support billions of people as part of a thriving and sustainable biosphere.  The key to reaching this vision of the future is to learn from past revolutions: future civilizations must be fuelled from sustainable energy sources, and they must undertake a greatly enhanced recycling of resources.
</p></blockquote>
<p>And here is where the lessons of previous &#8216;revolutions&#8217; are especially useful.   As I said <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/10/31/major-transitions-in-evolution/">last time</a>, they list four:</p>
<p>1.  The origin of life, before 3.8 billion years ago.</p>
<p>2.  The Great Oxidation, when photosynthesis put oxygen into the atmosphere between 3.4 and 2.5 billion years ago. </p>
<p>3.  The rise of complex life (eukaryotes), roughly 2 billion years ago. </p>
<p>4.  The rise of humanity, roughly 0 billion years ago.</p>
<p>Their book argues that all three of the earlier revolutions disrupted the Earth&#8217;s climate, pushing it out of stability.  It only restabilized after reaching a fundamentally new state.  This new stable state could only be born after some new feedback mechanisms had developed.  </p>
<p>For example, in every revolution, it has been important to find ways to recycle &#8216;wastes&#8217; and make them into useful &#8216;resources&#8217;.  This was true with oxygen during the Great Oxidation&#8230; and it must be true with our waste products now!  </p>
<p>In any sort of approximate equilibrium state, there can&#8217;t be much &#8216;waste&#8217;: almost everything needs to be recycled.  Serious amounts of &#8216;waste&#8217; can only occur for fairly short periods of time, in the grand scheme of things.  For example, we are now burning fossil fuels and creating a lot of waste CO<sub>2</sub>, but this can&#8217;t go on forever: it&#8217;s only a transitional phase.</p>
<h4> Apocalypse <i>and</i> Revolution?</h4>
<p>I should talk about all this in more detail someday.   But not today.</p>
<p>For now, I would just like to suggest that &#8216;apocalypse&#8217; and &#8216;revolution&#8217; are not really diametrically opposed alternatives.  All three previous revolutions destroyed the world as it had been!  </p>
<p>For example, when the Great Oxidation occurred, this was an &#8216;apocalypse&#8217; for anaerobic life forms, who now struggle to survive in specialized niches here and there.  It only seems like a triumphant &#8216;revolution&#8217; <i>in retrospect</i>, to the new life forms that comfortably survive in the new world.</p>
<p>So, I think we&#8217;re headed for a combination of apocalypse and revolution: the death of many old things, and the birth of new ones.   At best we have a bit of influence in nudging things in a direction we like.  I don&#8217;t think &#8216;retreat&#8217; is a real option: nostalgic though I am about many old things, time always pushes us relentlessly into new and strange worlds. </p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>I&#8217;ve been spending a lot of time Google+ lately, trying to drum up interest in the Azimuth Project.  Unsurprisingly, my &#8216;fun&#8217; posts have attracted more attention than those dealing with serious issues.  This confirms my suspicion that computers were invented so we could goof off while it looks like we&#8217;re working.</p>
<p>My most popular contribution was this eye-catching image:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/illusion4.jpg" /></div>
<p>63 people shared it with others, despite my warning that it causes brain damage.  By the way, <i>there&#8217;s another cool illusion at the end of this post</i>, but it&#8217;s only visible to people who read the whole thing.</p>
<p>The second most popular tidbit was this movie of <a href="http://alucier.web.wesleyan.edu/">Alvin Lucier&#8217;s</a> &#8220;Music for solo performer&#8221;.  If you enjoy puzzles, watch it <i>before</i> reading my explanation, and try to figure out what&#8217;s going on:</p>
<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q73ZbDhQsb4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span>
<p>This piece exploits the fact that the brain&#8217;s alpha waves&#8212;which only start when you&#8217;re relaxed with eyes closed&#8212;have a frequency of 8-12 hertz. Thus, if amplified enormously, they can be made audible! To perform this piece, you put electrodes on your head and route the signal through an amplifier to loudspeakers coupled to percussion instruments. The performer here wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>I welcomed the challenge to reduce my performative activities to a minimum. While working out my interpretation I slowly learned to be aware of my mental activities. I acquired a sensitivity for subtle changes in tension and the ability to switch the state of my brain from beta to alpha and back again. Nevertheless, the outcome is not completely controllable. This makes the live act quite thrilling.</p></blockquote>

<p>But I posted about some deadly serious issues, too!</p>
<h4> Is the Earth&#8217;s surface warming? </h4>
<p>In 2010, a Berkeley physicist named Richard Muller decided to launch the <a href="http://berkeleyearth.org/">Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature (BEST)</a> project to independently check what the Earth&#8217;s surface temperature has been doing.  The team included physicists, statisticians, and the climatologist <a href="http://berkeleyearth.org/aboutus.php">Judith Curry</a>, noted for &#8220;challenging the IPCC consensus&#8221; (her words).  </p>
<p>The Charles G. Koch Foundation, which <a href="http://sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Koch_Industries#Climate_denial_and_delay">helps bankroll those who support inaction on climate change</a>, gave Muller’s project $150,000.  Anthony Watts, one of the big climate skeptic bloggers, wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
I’m prepared to accept whatever result they produce&#8230;
</p></blockquote>
<p>On the other side of the aisle, some who believe in global warming pre-emptively pooh-poohed the project. </p>
<p>Now BEST has released a <a href="http://www.berkeleyearth.org/resources.php">bunch of papers</a> on their results.  Here&#8217;s their <a href="www.berkeleyearth.org/Resources/Berkeley_Earth_Summary_20_Oct">summary</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Global warming is real, according to a major study released today.  Despite issues raised by climate change skeptics, the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature study finds reliable evidence of a rise in the average world land temperature of approximately 1 &deg;C since the mid-1950s.</p>
<p>Analyzing temperature data from 15 sources, in some cases going back as 1800, the Berkeley Earth study directly addressed scientific concerns raised by skeptics, including the urban heat island effect, poor station quality, and the risk of selection bias.  </p>
<p>On the basis of its analysis, according to Berkeley Earth&#8217;s founder and scientific director, the group concluded that earlier studies based on more limited data by teams in the United States and Britain had accurately estimated the extent of land surface warming.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our biggest surprise was that the new results agreed so closely with the warming values published previously by other times in the U.S. and U.K.,&#8221; Muller said.  &#8220;This confirms that these studies were done carefully and that potential biases identified by climate change skeptics did not seriously affect their conclusions.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<div align="center"><a href="http://www.berkeleyearth.org/images/Updated_Comparison_10.jpg"><img width="420" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.berkeleyearth.org/images/Updated_Comparison_10.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>Anthony Watts&#8217; response is <a href="http://wattsupwiththat.com/2011/10/20/the-berkeley-earth-surface-temperature-project-puts-pr-before-peer-review/">here</a>.  As you might have guessed, he&#8217;s not &#8220;accepting whatever result they produce&#8221;.</p>
<p>Is it even <i>possible</i> for someone to back down from a position they&#8217;re deeply invested in?   It may require a bit of help&#8212;an act of kindness.   In Brian Merchant&#8217;s article <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/green_room/2011/05/do_climate_skeptics_change_their_minds.2.html">Do climate skeptics change their minds?</a>, he writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
I asked Anthony Watts, the meteorologist who runs what may be the most popular climate-skeptic blog, <i>Watts Up With That</i>, what could lead him to accept climate science. A &#8220;starting point for the process,&#8221; he said, wouldn&#8217;t begin with more facts but instead with a public apology from the high profile scientists who have labeled him and his colleagues &#8220;deniers.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<h4> Should we study geoengineering? </h4>
<p>Should we study our options for fighting global warming by <i>deliberately manipulating the Earth&#8217;s climate?</i>  This is called <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Geoengineering">geoengineering</a>&#8212;and not surprisingly, it makes lots of people nervous.  There are plenty of things to worry about.   But can we afford to completely <i>ignore</i> it?</p>
<p>An organization called the <a href="http://www.bipartisanpolicy.org/">Bipartisan Policy Center</a>, set up by four famous US senators, two Democratic and two Republican (Daschle, Mitchell, Baker and Dole) has released a <a href="http://www.bipartisanpolicy.org/news/press-releases/2011/10/blue-ribbon-task-force-climate-remediation-releases-report-calling-feder">report on this question</a>.</p>
<p>Written by a panel of 18 experts on the natural sciences, social sciences, science policy, foreign policy, national security, and environmental issues, the report concludes that the U.S. government should start a &#8220;focused and systematic program of research into climate remediation.&#8221;  They emphasize that it&#8217;s &#8220;far too premature to contemplate deployment of any climate remediation technology&#8221;, and note that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most climate remediation concepts proposed to date involve some combination of risks, financial costs, and/or physical limitations that make them inappropriate to pursue except as complementary or emergency measures—for example, if the climate system reaches a &#8220;tipping point&#8221; and swift remedial action is required.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, they point out that even if the U.S. decides not to engage in geoengineering, it &#8220;needs to evaluate steps others might take and be able to effectively participate in&#8212;and lead&#8212;the important international conversations&#8221;.  </p>
<h4> Climate science report </h4>
<p>The <a href="http://insights.wri.org/news/2011/10/qa-release-climate-science-2009-2010">World Resources Institute</a> has put out a 48-page report called <a href="pdf.wri.org/climate_science_2009-2010.pdf"><i>Climate Science 2009-2010</i></a>, reviewing recent work.   For example:</p>
<p>&bull; 2000-2009 was the warmest decade on record since 1880 (NASA).</p>
<p>&bull;  The area of Arctic ice that&#8217;s been around for many years decreased by 42 percent between 2005 and 2008.  This ice has gotten about 0.6 meters thinner during that time.  The average thickness of the seasonal ice in midwinter is about 2 meters.  (Kwok <i>et al</i>.).</p>
<p>&bull;  Ocean acidification&#8212;caused by the buildup of carbon dioxide concentrations&#8212;is a threat to coral in areas such as the Great Barrier Reef, and is happening much more quickly than anticipated (De’ath <i>et al</i>.). It is now recognized as having implications for the entire ocean food web which is critical to whales, fish, and mollusks (Munday <i>et al.</i>, Gooding <i>et al</i>. and Comeau <i>et al</i>.).</p>
<p>&bull;  A global average temperature increase of 7° C, which is toward the extreme upper part of the range of current projections, would make large portions of the world uninhabitable to humans (Sherwood <i>et al</i>.).  For more, see my article <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/07/30/how-hot-is-too-hot/">How Hot is Too Hot?</a></p>
<p>&bull; Recent literature (Yin <i>et al</i>.) suggests that sea level rise will likely not be even around the globe. In other words, sea level rise does not occur just like water being added to a bathtub. As a result, the northeast coast of the United States may be especially affected by changes in sea level due to changes in ocean circulation.</p>
<p>&bull; The latest research (Francis <i>et al</i>. and Petoukhov <i>et al</i>.) also suggests that recent winter weather experienced in temperate Northern Hemisphere could be connected to climate change. As winter sea ice cover in the Arctic Ocean disappears, it can create a pressure and temperature gradient that sucks heat out of Europe. Therefore, recent extreme winter weather is not inconsistent with increases in global average temperature.</p>
<h4> Shrinking Arctic lakes </h4>
<p>Some <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21228345.000-strange-case-of-the-vanishing-arctic-lakes.html">Arctic lakes are shrinking.</a>  Why? One possibility: warmer temperatures and higher winds could cause more evaporation. Another: melting permafrost could let lake water soak into thawed soil.  The scientist involved, Mark Carroll at the University of Maryland in College Park, &#8220;is not aware of any evidence that the permafrost in the far north is melting yet&#8221;.  Hmm&#8212;compare my article <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/09/01/melting-permafrost/">Melting Permafrost</a>.</p>
<h4> Experiments in deforestation </h4>
<p>Starting in December, a Malaysian state-owned company will start chopping down 75,000 hectares of rainforest on Borneo, to create yet another palm oil plantation.  Unfortunately, that doesn&#8217;t count as newsworthy!  What&#8217;s news is that <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn21056-forest-loggers-join-worlds-biggest-ecology-experiment.html">a team led by Rob Ewers at Imperial College London will do an experiment based on this</a>. Working to Ewers&#8217;s design, the loggers will leave patches of rainforest of different sizes, and at different distances from other patches of rainforest, to determine the effects of different levels of deforestation.</p>
<h4> Permian-Triassic extinction </h4>
<p>About 251 million years ago, our Earth suffered its biggest mass extinction event ever: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permian%E2%80%93Triassic_extinction_event">Permian-Triassic extinction</a>.   As many as  96% of all marine species and 70% of terrestrial vertebrates went extinct!  Here&#8217;s what the sea bottom looked like before:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/extinction"><img width="420" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/extinction/permian.jpg" alt="" /></a></div>
<p>and after:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/extinction"><img width="420" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/extinction/triassic.jpg" alt="" /></a></div>
<p>It took 50 million years for the Earth to completely recover its biodiversity!</p>
<p>Naturally there&#8217;s a lot of interest in figuring out what happened.  The CO<sub>2</sub> concentration soared to 2000 parts per million, and the temperature rose about 8 &deg;C, but other things may have been at work too.  I won&#8217;t attempt to discuss all this here!&#8212;just one little bit of news.  Gregory Brennecka and others from Arizona State University and University of Cincinnati found that the ocean was low in oxygen <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/10/111011112915.htm">for at most tens of thousands of years before the Permian-Triassic extinction</a>. That&#8217;s shorter than previous estimates.</p>
<p>They saw a big shift in the ratio of <sup>238</sup>U to <sup>235</sup>U in carbonate rocks immediately prior to the mass extinction, which they claim signals an increase in oceanic anoxia&#8212;this is apparently a new technique.  The team also found higher Th/U ratios in the same interval, which indicate a decrease in the uranium content of seawater.  They also consider lower concentrations of uranium in seawater to be a sign of ocean anoxia.</p>
<h4> Planet 3.0 </h4>
<p>Azimuth has joined <a href="http://planet3.org/">Planet 3.0</a> an organization of <a href="http://blogs.planet3.org/community/">climate-related blogs</a> that also features blog articles of its own.  It has an editorial team consisting of <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/mtobis/">Michael Tobis</a> and <a href="http://ofdan.ca/">Dan Moutal</a>, and a scientific advisory team consisting <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sme/">Steve Easterbrook</a>, <a href="http://arthur.shumwaysmith.com/life/">Arthur Smith</a>, <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/mtobis/">Michael Tobis</a>, and <a href="http://ourchangingclimate.wordpress.com/about/">Bart Verheggen</a>. </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know much about it yet, but it could be good.  I&#8217;ve been wanting more people to join me blogging here on Azimuth, to build up more of a community and a higher level of energy, but maybe this is a better solution: keep Azimuth as is, but also put climate-related blog articles on Planet 3.0. We&#8217;ll see.</p>
<h4> The part you&#8217;ve been waiting for </h4>
<div align="center"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/illusion3.jpg" /></div>
<p>As with the picture at the top of this article, if you focus on any small patch, strange things seem to start happening <i>everywhere else</i>.  Your eyes gets curious, and it&#8217;s hard to avoid looking.  As your eyes flicker back and forth, the horizontal lines seem to twitch and bend.</p>
<p>At least, that&#8217;s what <i>I</i> see!</p>

			<div class="textwidget"><p>You can <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics">include math in your comments using LaTeX</a>,  but you need to do it this way:</p>
<p>&#036;latex  E = mc^2&#036;</p>
<p>You need the word 'latex' right after the first dollar sign, and it needs a space after it.  Double dollar signs don't work, and other limitations apply, some described <a href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/latex/">here</a>.  You can't preview comments here, but I'm happy to fix errors.</p>
