<h3> Climate models </h3>
<p>Though it&#8217;s not my central concern in this class, we should talk a little about climate models.</p>
<p>There are many levels of sophistication when it comes to climate models.  It is wise to start with simple, not very realistic models before ascending to complicated, supposedly more realistic ones.  This is true in every branch of math or physics: working with simple models gives you insights that are crucial for correctly handling more complicated models.  You shouldn&#8217;t fly a fighter jet if you haven&#8217;t tried something simpler yet, like a bicycle: you&#8217;ll probably crash and burn.</p>
<p>As I mentioned <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/math_environment/math_environment_1.pdf">last time</a>, models in biology, ecology and climate science pose new challenges compared to models of the simpler systems that physicists like best.  As Chris Lee emphasizes, biology inherently deals with &#8216;high data&#8217; systems where the relevant information can rarely be captured in a few variables, or even a few field equations.  </p>
<p>(Field theories involve infinitely many variables, but somehow the ones physicists like best allow us to make a small finite number of measurements and extract a prediction from them!  It would be nice to understand this more formally.  In quantum field theory, the &#8216;nice&#8217; field theories are called &#8216;renormalizable&#8217;, but a similar issue shows up classically, as we&#8217;ll see in a second.)</p>
<p>The climate system is in part a system that feels like &#8216;physics&#8217;: the flow of air in the atmosphere and water in the ocean.  But some of the equations here, for example the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations">Navier&#8211;Stokes equations</a>, are already &#8216;nasty&#8217; by the standards of mathematical physics, since the existence of solutions over long periods of time has not been proved.  This is related to &#8216;turbulence&#8217;, a process where information at one length scale can significantly affect information at another dramatically different length scale, making precise predictions difficult.  </p>
<p>Climate prediction is, we hope and believe, somewhat insulated from the challenges of weather prediction: we can hope to know the average temperature of the Earth within a degree or two in 5 years even though we don&#8217;t know whether it will rain in Manhattan on October 8, 2017.  But this hope is something that needs to be studied, not something we can take for granted.</p>
<p>On top of this, the climate is, quite crucially, a <i>biological</i> system.  Plant and animal life really affects the climate, as well as being affected by it.   So, for example, a really detailed climate model may have a portion specially devoted to the behavior of plankton in the Mediterranean.  This means that climate models will never be as &#8216;neat and clean&#8217; as physicists and mathematicians tend to want&#8212;at least, not if these models are trying to be truly realistic.  And as I suggested last time, this general type of challenge&#8212;the challenge posed by biosystems too complex to precisely model&#8212;may ultimately push mathematics in very new directions.  </p>
<p>I call this <font color="green">green mathematics</font>, without claiming I know what it will be like.  The term is mainly an incitement to think big.  I wrote a little about it <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/networks_1.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>However, being a bit of an old-fashioned mathematician myself, I&#8217;ll start by talking about some very simple climate models, gradually leading up to some interesting puzzles about the &#8216;ice ages&#8217; or, more properly, &#8216;glacial cycles&#8217; that have been pestering the Earth for the last 20 million years or so.  First, though, let&#8217;s take a quick look at the hierarchy of different climate models.</p>
<h3> Different kinds of climate models </h3>
<p>&bull; <b>Zero-dimensional models</b> are like theories of classical mechanics instead of classical field theory.  In other words, they only consider with globally averaged quantities, like the average temperature of the Earth, or perhaps regionally averaged quantities, like the average temperature of each ocean and each continent.   This sounds silly, but it&#8217;s a great place to start.  It amounts to dealing with finitely many variables depending on time:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x_1%28t%29%2C+%5Cdots+x_n%28t%29%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(x_1(t), &#92;dots x_n(t))" class="latex" /></p>
<p>We might assume these obey a differential equation, which we can always make first-order by introducing extra variables:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7Bd+x_i%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D+f_i%28t%2C+x_1%28t%29%2C+%5Cdots%2C+x_n%28t%29%29++%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{d x_i}{d t} = f_i(t, x_1(t), &#92;dots, x_n(t))  } " class="latex" /> </p>
<p>This kind of model is studied quite generally in the subject of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_systems_theory">dynamical systems theory</a>.</p>
<p>In particular, <b><a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Energy+balance+model">energy balance models</a></b> try to predict the average surface temperature of the Earth depending on the energy flow.  Energy comes in from the Sun and is radiated to outer space by the Earth. What happens in between is modeled by averaged feedback equations.</p>
<p>The Earth has various approximately conserved quantities like the total amount of carbon, or oxygen, or nitrogen&#8212;radioactive decay creates and destroys these elements, but it&#8217;s pretty negligible in climate physics.  So, these things move around from one form to another.  We can imagine a model where some of our variables <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_i%28t%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x_i(t)" class="latex" /> are the amounts of carbon in the air, or in the soil, or in the ocean&#8212;different &#8216;boxes&#8217;, abstractly speaking.   It will flow from one box to another in a way that depends on various other variables in our model.   This idea gives class of models called <b><a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Box+model">box models</a></b>.   </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s one described by Nathan Urban in <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week304.html">&#8220;week304&#8221;</a> of This Week&#8217;s Finds:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week304.html"><img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/nathan_urban_model.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>I&#8217;m interested in box models because they&#8217;re a simple example of &#8216;networked systems&#8217;: we&#8217;ve got boxes hooked up by wires, or pipes, and we can imagine a big complicated model formed by gluing together smaller models, attaching the wires from one to the wires of another.  We can use category theory to formalize this.  In category theory we&#8217;d call these smaller models &#8216;morphisms&#8217;, and the process of gluing them together is called &#8216;composing&#8217; them.   I&#8217;ll talk about this a lot more someday.</p>
<p>&bull;  <b>One-dimensional models</b> treat temperature and perhaps other quantities as a function of one spatial coordinate (in addition to time): for example, the altitude.  This lets us include one dimensional processes of heat transport in the model, like radiation and (a very simplified model of) convection.</p>
<p>&bull; <b>Two-dimensional models</b> treat temperature and other quantities as a function of two spatial coordinates (and time): for example, altitude and latitude.  Alternatively, we could treat the atmosphere as a thin layer and think of temperature at some fixed altitude as a function of latitude and longitude!</p>
<p>&bull;  <b>Three-dimensional models</b> treat temperature and other quantities as a function of all three spatial coordinates.  At this point we can, if we like, use the full-fledged Navier&#8211;Stokes equations to describe the motion of air in the atmosphere and water in the ocean.  Needless to say, these models can become very complex and computation-intensive, depending on how many effects we want to take into account and at what resolution we wish to model the atmosphere and ocean.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/General+circulation+model">General circulation models</a></b> or <b>GCMs</b> try to model the circulation of the atmosphere and/or ocean.  </p>
<p><b>Atmospheric GCMs</b> or AGCMs model the atmosphere and typically contain a land-surface model, while imposing some boundary conditions describing sea surface temperatures.   <b>Oceanic GCMs</b> or OGCMs model the ocean (with fluxes from the atmosphere imposed) and may or may not contain a sea ice model.   <b>Coupled atmosphere–ocean GCMs</b> or AOGCMs do both atmosphere and ocean.  These the basis for detailed predictions of future climate, such as are discussed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/organization/organization.shtml#.UHTT01ElqSo">IPCC</a>.   </p>
<p>&bull;  Backing down a bit, we can consider <b><a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Earth+model+of+intermediate+complexity">Earth models of intermediate complexity</a></b> or EMICs.  These might have a 3-dimensional atmosphere and a 2-dimensional &#8216;slab ocean&#8217;, or a 3d ocean and an energy-moisture balance atmosphere.  </p>
<p>&bull; Alternatively, we can consider <b>regional circulation models</b> or RCMs.  These are limited-area models that can be run at higher resolution than the GCMs and are thus able to better represent fine-grained phenomena, including processes resulting from finer-scale topographic and land-surface features.  Typically the regional atmospheric model is run while receiving lateral boundary condition inputs from a relatively-coarse resolution atmospheric analysis model or from the output of a GCM.  As Michael Knap pointed out in class, there&#8217;s again something from network theory going on here: we are &#8216;gluing in&#8217; the RCM into a &#8216;hole&#8217; cut out of a GCM.</p>
<p>Modern GCMs as used in the <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/publications_ipcc_fourth_assessment_report_wg1_report_the_physical_science_basis.htm">2007 IPCC report</a> tended to run around 100-kilometer resolution.  Individual clouds can only start to be resolved at about 10 kilometers or below.  One way to deal with this is to take the output of higher resolution <i>regional</i> climate models and use it to adjust parameters, etcetera, in GCMs.</p>
<h3> The hierarchy of climate models </h3>
<p>The climate scientist Isaac Held has a great article about the hierarchy of climate models:</p>
<p>&bull; Isaac Held, <a href="http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/bibliography/related_files/ih0501.pdf">The gap between simulation and understanding in climate modeling</a>, <i>Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society</i> (November 2005), 1609&#8211;1614.</p>
<p>In it, he writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The importance of such a hierarchy for climate modeling and studies of atmospheric and oceanic dynamics has often been emphasized. See, for example, Schneider and Dickinson (1974), and, especially, Hoskins (1983). But, despite notable exceptions in a few subfields, climate theory has not, in my opinion, been very successful at hierarchy construction. I do not mean to imply that important work has not been performed, of course, but only that the gap between comprehensive climate models and more idealized models has not been successfully closed.</p>
<p>Consider, by analogy, another field that must deal with exceedingly complex systems—molecular biology. How is it that biologists have made such dramatic and steady progress in sorting out the human genome and the interactions of the thousands of proteins of which we are constructed? Without doubt, one key has been that nature has provided us with a hierarchy of biological systems of increasing complexity that are amenable to experimental manipulation, ranging from bacteria to fruit fly to mouse to man. Furthermore, the nature of evolution assures us that much of what we learn from simpler organisms is directly relevant to deciphering the workings of their more complex relatives. What good fortune for biologists to be presented with precisely the kind of hierarchy needed to understand a complex system! Imagine how much progress would have been made if they were limited to studying man alone.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Nature has not provided us with simpler climate systems that form such a beautiful hierarchy. Planetary atmospheres provide insights into the range of behaviors that are possible, but the known planetary atmospheres are few, and each has its own idiosyncrasies. Their study has connected to terrestrial climate theory on occasion, but the influence has not been systematic. Laboratory simulations of rotating and/or convecting fluids remain valuable and underutilized, but they cannot address our most complex problems. We are left with the necessity of constructing our own hierarchies of climate models.</p>
<p>Because nature has provided the biological hierarchy, it is much easier to focus the attention of biologists on a few representatives of the key evolutionary steps toward greater complexity. And, such a focus is central to success. If every molecular biologist had simply studied his or her own favorite bacterium or insect, rather than focusing so intensively on <i>E. coli</i> or <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, it is safe to assume that progress would have been far less rapid. </p>
<p>It is emblematic of our problem that studying the biological hierarchy is experimental science, while constructing and studying climate hierarchies is theoretical science. A biologist need not convince her colleagues that the model organism she is advocating for intensive study is well designed or well posed, but only that it fills an important niche in the hierarchy of complexity and that it is convenient for study. Climate theorists are faced with the difficult task of both constructing a hierarchy of models and somehow focusing the attention of the community on a few of these models so that our efforts accumulate efficiently. Even if one believes that one has defined the <i>E. coli</i> of climate models, it is difficult to energize (and fund) a significant number of researchers to take this model seriously and devote years to its study.</p>
<p>And yet, despite the extra burden of trying to create a consensus as to what the appropriate climate model hierarchies are, the construction of such hierarchies must, I believe, be a central goal of climate theory in the twenty-first century. There are no alternatives if we want to understand the climate system and our<br />
comprehensive climate models. Our understanding will be embedded within these hierarchies.
</p></blockquote>
<p>It is possible that mathematicians, with a lot of training from climate scientists, have the sort of patience and delight in &#8216;study for study&#8217;s sake&#8217; to study this hierarchy of models.  Here&#8217;s one that Held calls &#8216;the fruit fly of climate models&#8217;:</p>

<h3> The very simplest model </h3>
<p>The very simplest model is a zero-dimensional energy balance model.  In this model we treat the Earth as having just one degree of freedom&#8212;its temperature&#8212;and we treat it as a blackbody in equilibrium with the radiation coming from the Sun.</p>
<p>A <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_body">black body</a></b> is an object that perfectly absorbs and therefore also perfectly emits all electromagnetic radiation at all frequencies.  Real bodies don&#8217;t have this property; instead, they absorb radiation at certain frequencies better than others, and some not at all. But there are materials that do come rather close to a black body. Usually one adds another assumption to the characterization of an ideal black body: namely, that the <i>radiation is independent of the direction</i>.</p>
<p>When the black body has a certain temperature <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T," class="latex" /> it will emit electromagnetic radiation, so it will send out a certain amount of energy per second for every square meter of surface area.  We will call this the <b>energy flux</b> and denote this as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f." class="latex" />  The SI unit for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" /> is W/m<sup>2</sup>: that is, watts per square meter.   Here the <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt">watt</a></b> is a unit of energy per time.</p>
<p>Electromagnetic radiation comes in different wavelengths.  So, can ask how much energy flux our black body emits per change in wavelength.  This depends on the wavelength.  We will call this the <b>monochromatic energy flux</b> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%7B%5Clambda%7D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_{&#92;lambda}." class="latex" />  The SI unit for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%7B%5Clambda%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_{&#92;lambda}" class="latex" /> is W/m<sup>2</sup>&mu;m, where &mu;m stands for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micrometre"><b>micrometer</b></a>: a millionth of a meter, which is a unit of wavelength.  We call <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%5Clambda&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_&#92;lambda" class="latex" /> the &#8216;monochromatic&#8217; energy flux because it gives a number for any fixed wavelength <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;lambda." class="latex" /> When we integrate the monochromatic energy flux over all wavelengths, we get the energy flux <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f." class="latex" /></p>
<p>Max Planck was able to calculate <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%7B%5Clambda%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_{&#92;lambda}" class="latex" /> for a blackbody at temperature <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T," class="latex" /> but only by inventing a bit of quantum mechanics.  His result is called the <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_law">Planck distribution</a></b>: if</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+f_%7B%5Clambda%7D%28T%29+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B2+hc%5E2%7D%7B%5Clambda%5E5%7D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B+e%5E%7B%5Cfrac%7Bhc%7D%7B%5Clambda+k+T%7D%7D+-+1+%7D+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ f_{&#92;lambda}(T) = &#92;frac{2 hc^2}{&#92;lambda^5} &#92;frac{1}{ e^{&#92;frac{hc}{&#92;lambda k T}} - 1 } } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="h" class="latex" /> is Planck&#8217;s constant, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c" class="latex" /> is the speed of light, and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" /> is Boltzmann&#8217;s constant.  Deriving this would be tons of fun, but also a huge digression from the point of this class.</p>
<p>You can integrate <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%5Clambda&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_&#92;lambda" class="latex" /> over all wavelengths <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;lambda" class="latex" /> to get the total energy flux&#8212;that is, the total power per square meter emitted by a blackbody.  The answer is surprisingly simple: if the total energy flux is defined by</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7Bf+%3D+%5Cint_0%5E%5Cinfty+f_%7B%5Clambda%7D%28T%29+%5C%2C+d+%5Clambda+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{f = &#92;int_0^&#92;infty f_{&#92;lambda}(T) &#92;, d &#92;lambda } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>then in fact we can do the integral and get</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f+%3D+%5Csigma+%5C%3B+T%5E4++&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f = &#92;sigma &#92;; T^4  " class="latex" /></p>
<p>for some constant <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csigma.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;sigma." class="latex" /> This fact is called the <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan-Boltzmann_law">Stefan&#8211;Boltzmann law</a></b>, and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csigma&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;sigma" class="latex" /> is called the <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan-Boltzmann_constant">Stefan-Boltzmann constant</a></b>:</p>

<p>Using this formula, we can assign to every energy flux <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" /> a black body temperature <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T," class="latex" /> which is the temperature that an ideal black body would need to have to emit <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f." class="latex" /></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s use this to calculate the temperature of the Earth in this simple model!    A planet like Earth gets energy from the Sun and loses energy by radiating to space. Since the Earth sits in empty space, these two processes are the only relevant ones that describe the energy flow. </p>
<p>The sunshine near Earth carries an energy flux of about 1370 watts per square meter.  If the temperature of the Earth is constant, as much energy is coming in as going out.   So, we might try to balance the incoming energy flux with the outgoing flux of a blackbody at temperature <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T" class="latex" />:</p>

<p>and then solve for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T" class="latex" />:</p>

<p>We&#8217;re making a big mistake here.  Do you see what it is?  But let&#8217;s go ahead and see what we get.  As mentioned, the Stefan&#8211;Boltzmann constant has a value of </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Csigma+%5Capprox+5.67+%5Ctimes+10%5E%7B-8%7D+%5C%2C+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cmathrm%7BW%7D%7D%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bm%7D%5E2+%5Cmathrm%7BK%7D%5E4%7D++%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;sigma &#92;approx 5.67 &#92;times 10^{-8} &#92;, &#92;frac{&#92;mathrm{W}}{&#92;mathrm{m}^2 &#92;mathrm{K}^4}  } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>so we get</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+T+%3D+%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7B1370%7D%7B5.67+%5Ctimes+10%5E%7B-8%7D%7D+%5Cright%29%5E%7B1%2F4%7D+%5Cmathrm%7BK%7D+%7D++%5Capprox+%282.4+%5Ccdot+10%5E9%29%5E%7B1%2F4%7D+%5Cmathrm%7BK%7D+%5Capprox+394+%5Cmathrm%7BK%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ T = &#92;left(&#92;frac{1370}{5.67 &#92;times 10^{-8}} &#92;right)^{1/4} &#92;mathrm{K} }  &#92;approx (2.4 &#92;cdot 10^9)^{1/4} &#92;mathrm{K} &#92;approx 394 &#92;mathrm{K} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>This is much too hot!  Remember, this temperature is in kelvin, so we need to subtract 273 to get Celsius.  Doing so, we get a temperature of 121 &deg;C.  This is above the boiling point of water!</p>
<p>Do you see what we did wrong?  We neglected a phenomenon known as <i>night</i>.  The Earth emits infrared radiation in all directions, but it only absorbs sunlight on the daytime side.  Our calculation would be correct if the Earth were a flat disk of perfectly black stuff facing the Sun and <i>perfectly insulated on the back</i> so that it could only emit infrared radiation over the same area that absorbs sunlight!  But in fact emission takes place over a larger area than absorption.  This makes the Earth cooler.</p>
<p>To get the right answer, we need to take into account the fact that the Earth is round.  But just for fun, let&#8217;s see how well a flat Earth theory does.  A few climate skeptics may even believe this theory.  Suppose the Earth were a flat disk of radius <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r," class="latex" /> made of black stuff facing the Sun but <i>not</i> insulated on back.  Then it would absorb power equal to</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1370+%5Ccdot+%5Cpi+r%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="1370 &#92;cdot &#92;pi r^2" class="latex" /> </p>
<p>since the area of the disk is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi+r%5E2%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;pi r^2," class="latex" /> but it would emit power equal to</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csigma+T%5E4+%5Ccdot+2+%5Cpi+r%5E2+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;sigma T^4 &#92;cdot 2 &#92;pi r^2 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>since it emits from both the front and back.  Setting these equal, we now get</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7B1370%7D%7B2%7D+%5Ctextrm%7BW%7D%2F%5Ctextrm%7Bm%7D%5E2+%3D+%5Csigma+T%5E4+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{1370}{2} &#92;textrm{W}/&#92;textrm{m}^2 = &#92;sigma T^4 }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+T+%3D+%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7B1370+%5Ctextrm%7BW%7D%2F%5Ctextrm%7Bm%7D%5E2%7D%7B2+%5Csigma%7D%5Cright%29%5E%7B1%2F4%7D+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ T = &#92;left(&#92;frac{1370 &#92;textrm{W}/&#92;textrm{m}^2}{2 &#92;sigma}&#92;right)^{1/4} }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>This reduces the temperature by a factor of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B-1%2F4%7D+%5Capprox+0.84&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="2^{-1/4} &#92;approx 0.84" class="latex" /> from our previous estimate.  So now the temperature works out to be less:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0.84+%5Ccdot+394+%5Cmathrm%7BK%7D+%5Capprox+331+%5Cmathrm%7BK%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="0.84 &#92;cdot 394 &#92;mathrm{K} &#92;approx 331 &#92;mathrm{K} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>But this is still too hot!  It&#8217;s 58 &deg;C, or 136 &deg;F for you Americans out there who don&#8217;t have a good intuition for Celsius. </p>
<p>So, a flat black Earth facing the Sun would be a very hot Earth.</p>
<p>But now let&#8217;s stop goofing around and do the calculation with a round Earth.  Now it absorbs a beam of sunlight with area equal to its cross-section, a circle of area <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi+r%5E2.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;pi r^2." class="latex" />  But it emits infrared over its whole area of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=4+%5Cpi+r%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="4 &#92;pi r^2" class="latex" />: four times as much.   So now we get  </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+T+%3D+%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7B1370+%5Ctextrm%7BW%7D%2F%5Ctextrm%7Bm%7D%5E2%7D%7B4+%5Csigma%7D%5Cright%29%5E%7B1%2F4%7D+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ T = &#92;left(&#92;frac{1370 &#92;textrm{W}/&#92;textrm{m}^2}{4 &#92;sigma}&#92;right)^{1/4} }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>so the temperature is reduced by a further factor of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B-1%2F4%7D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="2^{-1/4}." class="latex" />  We get</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0.84+%5Ccdot+331+%5Cmathrm%7BK%7D+%5Capprox+279+%5Cmathrm%7BK%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="0.84 &#92;cdot 331 &#92;mathrm{K} &#92;approx 279 &#92;mathrm{K} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>That&#8217;s 6 &deg;C.   Not bad for a crude approximation!  Amusingly, it&#8217;s crucial that the area of a sphere is 4 times the area of a circle of the same radius.   The question if there is some deeper reason for this simple relation was posed as a <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/10/11/geometry-puzzle/">geometry puzzle</a> here on Azimuth.</p>
<p>I hope my clowning around hasn&#8217;t distracted you from the main point.  On average our simplified blackbody Earth absorbs 1370/4 = 342.5  watts of solar power per square meter.  So, that&#8217;s how much infrared radiation it has to emit.  If you can imagine how much heat a 60-watt bulb puts out when it&#8217;s surrounded by black paper, we&#8217;re saying our simplified Earth emits about 6 times that heat per square meter.</p>
<h3> The second simplest climate model </h3>
<p>The next step is to take into account the &#8216;albedo&#8217; of the Earth. The <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo">albedo</a></b> is the fraction of radiation that is instantly reflected without being absorbed. The albedo of a surface does depend on the material of the surface, and in particular on the wavelength of the radiation, of course. But in a first approximation for the average albedo of earth we can take:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7Balbedo%7D_%7B%5Cmathrm%7BEarth%7D%7D+%3D+0.3+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{albedo}_{&#92;mathrm{Earth}} = 0.3 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>This means that 30% of the radiation is instantly reflected and only 70% contributes to heating earth.   So, instead of getting heated by an average of 342.5 watts per square meter of sunlight, let&#8217;s assume it&#8217;s heated by</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0.7+%5Ctimes+342.5+%5Capprox+240+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="0.7 &#92;times 342.5 &#92;approx 240 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>watts per square meter.  Now we get a temperature of </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+T+%3D+%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7B240%7D%7B5.67+%5Ctimes+10%5E%7B-8%7D%7D+%5Cright%29%5E%7B1%2F4%7D+K+%7D++%5Capprox+%284.2+%5Ccdot+10%5E9%29%5E%7B1%2F4%7D+K+%5Capprox+255+K+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ T = &#92;left(&#92;frac{240}{5.67 &#92;times 10^{-8}} &#92;right)^{1/4} K }  &#92;approx (4.2 &#92;cdot 10^9)^{1/4} K &#92;approx 255 K " class="latex" /></p>
<p>This is -18 &deg;C.  The average temperature of earth is actually estimated to be considerably warmer: about +15 &deg;C.  This should not be a surprise: after all, 70% of the planet is covered by liquid water! This is an indication that the average temperature is most probably not below the freezing point of water.  </p>
<p>So, our new &#8216;improved&#8217; calculation gives a <i>worse</i> agreement with reality.  The actual Earth is roughly 33 kelvin warmer than our model Earth!  What&#8217;s wrong?  </p>
<p>The main explanation for the discrepancy seems to be: our model Earth doesn&#8217;t have an atmosphere yet!   Thanks in part to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas">greenhouse gases</a> like water vapor and carbon dioxide, sunlight at visible frequencies can get into the atmosphere more easily than infrared radiation can get out.  This warms the Earth.  This, in a nutshell, is why dumping a lot of extra carbon dioxide into the air can change our climate.  But of course we&#8217;ll need to turn to more detailed models, or experimental data, to see how strong this effect is.</p>
<p>Besides the greenhouse effect, there are many other things our ultra-simplified model leaves out: everything associated to the atmosphere and oceans, such as weather, clouds, the altitude-dependence of the temperature of the atmosphere&#8230; and also the way the albedo of the Earth depends on location and even on temperature and other factors.   There is much <i>much</i> more to say about all this&#8230; but not today!</p>

</div>
<p>I&#8217;m running a graduate math seminar called here at U. C. Riverside, and here are the slides for the first class:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/math_environment/math_environment_1.pdf">Mathematics of the Environment</a>, 2 October 2012. </p>
<p>I said a lot of things that aren&#8217;t on the slides, so they might be a tad cryptic.  I began by showing some graphs everyone should know by heart: </p>
<p>&bull; human population and the history of civilization, </p>
<p>&bull; the history of carbon emissions, </p>
<p>&bull; atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration for the last century or so, </p>
<p>&bull; global average temperatures for the last century or so, </p>
<p>&bull; the melting of the Arctic ice, and</p>
<p>&bull; the longer historical perspective of CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations.  </p>
<p>You can click on these graphs for more details&#8212;there are lots of links in the slides.</p>
<p>Then I posed the question of what mathematicians can do about this.  I suggested looking at the birth of written mathematics during the agricultural revolution as a good comparison, since we&#8217;re at the start of an equally big revolution now.   Have you thought about how Babylonian mathematics was intertwined with the agricultural revolution?</p>
<p>Then, I raised the idea of &#8216;ecotechnology&#8217; as a goal to strive for, assuming our current civilization doesn&#8217;t collapse to the point where it becomes pointless to even try.  As an example, I describe the perfect machine for reversing global warming&#8212;and show a nice picture of it.</p>
<p>Finally, I began sketching how ecotechnology is related to the mathematics of networks, though this will be a much longer story for later on.</p>
<p>Part of the idea here is that mathematics takes time to have an effect, so mathematicians might as well look ahead a little bit, while politicians, economists, business people and engineers should be doing things that have a big effect <i>soon</i>.  </p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>I&#8217;ve been quiet about global warming lately because I&#8217;ve decided that people won&#8217;t pay much attention until I present some ideas for <i>what to do</i>.   But I don&#8217;t want you to think I&#8217;ve simply stopped paying attention.  As you&#8217;ve probably heard, the area of the Arctic sea ice hit a new record low this year:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/2012/08/record-dominoes-8-nsidc-daily-sea-ice-extent.html"><img width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ecological/arctic_sea_ice_extent_NSIDC_9_2012.png" /></a></div>
<p>This graph was made using data from the <a href="http://nsidc.org/">National Snow and Ice Data Center</a>.  Lots of other data confirm this; you can see it <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/arcticseaicegraphs/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Here is how the minimum area of Arctic sea has been dropping, based on data from <a href="http://arctic.atmos.uiuc.edu/cryosphere/">Cryosphere Today</a>:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/2012/08/record-dominoes-8-nsidc-daily-sea-ice-extent.html"><img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ecological/arctic_minimum_sea_ice_area_cryosphere_today_9_2012.png" /></a></div>
<p>The volume is dropping even faster, as estimated by <a href="http://psc.apl.washington.edu/wordpress/research/projects/arctic-sea-ice-volume-anomaly/">PIOMAS</a>, the Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/2012/08/record-dominoes-9-piomas-sea-ice-volume.html"><img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ecological/arctic_sea_ice_volume_PIOMAS_2012.png" /></a></div>
<p>The rapid decline has taken a lot of experts by surprise.  Neven Acropolis, who keeps a hawk&#8217;s eye on these matters at the <a href="http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/2012/08/asi-2012-update-10-at-a-loss.html">Arctic Sea Ice Blog</a>, writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Basically, I&#8217;m at a loss for words, and not just because my jaw has dropped and won&#8217;t go back up as long as I&#8217;m looking at the graphs. I&#8217;m also at a loss&#8212;and I have already said it a couple of times this year&#8212;because I just don&#8217;t know what to expect any longer. I had a very steep learning curve in the past two years. We all did. But it feels as if everything I&#8217;ve learned has become obsolete. As if you&#8217;ve learned to play the guitar a bit in two years&#8217; time, and then all of a sudden have to play a xylophone. Will trend lines go even lower, or will the remaining ice pack with its edges so close to the North Pole start to freeze up?</p>
<p>Basically I have nothing to offer right now except short posts when yet another of those record dominoes has fallen. Hopefully I can come up with some useful post-melting season analysis when I return from a two-week holiday.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m at a loss at this loss. The 2007 record that stunned everyone, gets shattered without 2007 weather conditions. The ice is thin. PIOMAS was/is right.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The big question, of course, is how this should affect what we do.  <a href="http://reneweconomy.com.au/2012/on-thin-ice-time-frame-to-save-the-arctic-is-melting-away-88494">David Spratt</a> put it this way:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The 2007 IPPC report suggested that by 2100 Arctic sea-ice would likely exist in summer, though at a much reduced extent. Because many of the Arctic’s climate system tipping points are significantly related to the loss of sea-ice, the implication was that the world had some reasonable time to eliminate greenhouse emissions, and still be on time to “save the Arctic”. The 2007 IPCC-framed goal of reducing emissions 25 to 40 per cent by 2020 and 80 per cent by 2050 would “do the job” for the Arctic.</p>
<p>But the physical world didn’t agree. By 2006, scientist Richard Alley had observed that the Arctic was already melting “100 years ahead of schedule”. But the Arctic is not melting 100 years ahead of schedule: the climate system appears to be more sensitive to perturbations than anticipated, with observations showing many climate change impacts happening more quickly and at lower temperatures that projected, of which the Arctic is a prime example.</p>
<p>Politically, we are 100 years behind where we need to be on emissions reductions.
</p></blockquote>

					<p><i>guest post by <b><a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Glyn+Adgie">Glyn Adgie</a></b> and <b><a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Tim+van+Beek">Tim van Beek</a></b></i></p>
<h3>Or: Are the Milankovich Cycles Causing the Ice Ages?</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Milankovitch+cycle#Idea">Milankovich cycles</a> are periodic changes in how the Earth orbits the Sun.  One question is: can these changes can be responsible for the ice ages?  On the first sight it seems impossible, because the changes are simply too small. But it turns out that we can find a dynamical system where a small periodic external force is actually strengthened by random &#8216;noise&#8217; in the system. This phenomenon has been dubbed &#8216;stochastic resonance&#8217; and has been proposed as an explanation for the ice ages.</p>
<p>In this blog post we would like to provide an introduction to it. We will look at a bistable toy example. And you&#8217;ll even get to play with an online simulation that some members of the Azimuth Project created, namely Glyn Adgie, Allan Erskine and Jim Stuttard!</p>
<h3> Equations with noise </h3>
<p>In <i>This Weeks Finds</i>, back in <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/12/24/this-weeks-finds-week-308/">&#8216;week308&#8217;</a>, we had a look at a model with &#8216;noise&#8217;.  A lot of systems can be described by ordinary differential equations:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7Bd+x%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D+f%28x%2C+t%29%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{d x}{d t} = f(x, t)} " class="latex" /> </p>
<p>If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" /> is nice, the time evolution of the system will be a nice smooth function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%28t%29%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x(t)," class="latex" /> like the trajectory of a thrown stone. But there are situations where we have some kind of noise, a chaotic, fluctuating influence, that we would like to take into account. This could be, for example, turbulence in the air flow around a rocket. Or, in our case, short term fluctuations of the weather of the earth. If we take this into account, we get an equation of the form</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7Bd+x%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D+f%28x%2C+t%29+%2B+W%28t%29+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{d x}{d t} = f(x, t) + W(t) } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>where the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="W" class="latex" /> is some model of noise. In all the examples above, the noise is actually a simplified way to take into account fast degrees of freedom of the system at hand. This way we do not have to explicitly model these degrees of freedom, which is often impossible. But we could still try to formulate a model where long term influences of these degrees of freedom are included.</p>
<p>A way to make the above mathematically precise is to write the equation in the form</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d+x_t+%3D+f%28x%2C+t%29+d+t+%2B+g%28x%2C+t%29+d+W_t+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="d x_t = f(x, t) d t + g(x, t) d W_t " class="latex" /></p>
<p>as an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%C5%8D_calculus"><b>Ito stochastic differential equation</b></a> driven by a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_process"><b>Wiener process</b></a>.</p>
<p>The mathematics behind this is somewhat sophisticated, but we don&#8217;t need to delve into it in this blog post. For those who are interested in it, we have gathered some material here:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Stochastic+differential+equation">Stochastic differential equation</a>, Azimuth Library.</p>
<p>Physicists and engineers who model systems with ordinary and partial differential equations should think of stochastic differential equations as another tool in the toolbox. With this tool, it is possible to easily model systems that exhibit new behavior.</p>
<h3> What is stochastic resonance? </h3>
<p>Listening to your friend who sits across the table, the noise around you may become a serious distraction, although humans are famous for their ability to filter the signal&#8212;what your friend is saying &#8211; from the noise&#8212;all other sounds, people&#8217;s chatter, dishes clattering etc. But could you imagine a situation where <i>more noise</i> makes it <i>easier</i> to detect the signal?</p>
<p>Picture a  marble that sits in a double well potential:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/marble_in_double_well_potential.jpg" alt="double well potential" />
</div>
<p>This graphic is taken from</p>
<p>&bull; Roberto Benzi, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/nlin/0702008">Stochastic resonance: from climate to biology</a>.</p>
<p>This review paper is also a nice introduction to the topic.</p>
<p>This simple model can be applied to various situations. Since we think about the ice ages, we can interpret the two metastable states at the two minima of the potential in this way: the minimum to the left at -1 corresponds to the Earth in an ice age.   The minimum to the right at 1 corresponds to the Earth at warmer temperatures, as we know it today.</p>
<p>Let us add a small periodic force to the model.  This periodic force corresponds to different solar input due to periodic changes in Earth&#8217;s orbit: the Milankovich cycles.  There are actually several different cycles with different periods, but in our toy model we will consider only one force with one period.</p>
<p>If the force itself is too small to get the marble over the well that is between the two potential minima, we will not observe any periodic change in the position of the marble.  But if we add noise to the motion, it may happen that the force together with the noise succeed in getting the marble from one minimum to the other!  This is more likely to happen when the force is pushing the right way. So, it should happen with roughly the same periodicity as the force: we should see a &#8216;quasi-periodic&#8217; motion of the marble.  </p>
<p>But if we increase the noise more and more, the influence of the external force will become unrecognizable, and we will not recognize any pattern at all.</p>
<p>There should be a noise strength somewhere in between that makes the Milankovich cycles as visible as possible from the Earth&#8217;s temperature record.  In other words, if we think of the periodic force as a &#8216;signal&#8217;, there should be some amount of noise that maximizes the &#8216;signal-to-noise ratio&#8217;.  Can we find out what it is? </p>
<p>In order to find out, let us make our model precise.  Let&#8217;s take the time-independent potential to be</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+V%28x%29+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B4%7D+x%5E4+-+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D+x%5E2+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ V(x) = &#92;frac{1}{4} x^4 - &#92;frac{1}{2} x^2 } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>This potential has two local minima at <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%3D+%5Cpm+1.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x = &#92;pm 1." class="latex" />   Let&#8217;s take the time-dependent periodic forcing, or &#8216;signal&#8217;, to be</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%28t%29+%3D+-+A+%5C%3B+%5Csin%28t%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F(t) = - A &#92;; &#92;sin(t) " class="latex" /></p>
<p>The constant <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> is the amplitude of the periodic forcing.  The time-dependent effective potential of the system is therefore:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+V%28x%2C+t%29+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B4%7D+x%5E4+-+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D+x%5E2+-+A+%5C%3B+%5Csin%28t%29+x+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ V(x, t) = &#92;frac{1}{4} x^4 - &#92;frac{1}{2} x^2 - A &#92;; &#92;sin(t) x } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Including noise leads to the equation of motion, which is usually called a <b>Langevin equation</b> by physicists and chemists:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Bccl%7D+dX+%26%3D%26+-V%27%28X_t%2C+t%29+%5C%3B+dt+%2B+%5Csqrt%7B2D%7D+%5C%3B+dW_t+%5C%5C++%5C%5C++%26%3D%26+%28X_t+-+X_t%5E3+%2B+A+%5C%3B++%5Csin%28t%29%29+%5C%3B+dt++%2B+%5Csqrt%7B2D%7D+%5C%3B+dW_t++%5Cend%7Barray%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;begin{array}{ccl} dX &amp;=&amp; -V&#039;(X_t, t) &#92;; dt + &#92;sqrt{2D} &#92;; dW_t &#92;&#92;  &#92;&#92;  &amp;=&amp; (X_t - X_t^3 + A &#92;;  &#92;sin(t)) &#92;; dt  + &#92;sqrt{2D} &#92;; dW_t  &#92;end{array} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>For more about what a Langevin equation is, see our article on <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Stochastic+differential+equation">stochastic differential equations</a>.</p>
<p>This model has two free parameters, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="D." class="latex" />   As already mentioned, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> is the amplitude of the forcing.  <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="D" class="latex" /> is called the <b>diffusion coefficient</b> and represents the strength of noise. In our case it is a constant, but in more general models it could depend on space and time.</p>
<p>It is possible to write programs that generate simulations aka numerical approximations to solutions of stochastic differential equations. For those interested in how this works, there is an addendum at the bottom of the blog post that explains this.  We can use such a program to model the three cases of small, high and optimal noise level.  </p>
<p>In the following graphs, green is the external force, while red is the marble position.  Here is a simulation with a low level of noise:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/files/stochres_weaknoise.jpg" alt="low noise level" />
</div>
<p>As you can see, within the time of the simulation there is no transition from the metastable state at 1 to the one at -1. That is, in this situation Earth stays in the warm state.</p>
<p>Here is a simulation with a high noise level:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/Stochastic_Resonance_High_Noise_Level.JPG" alt="high noise level" />
</div>
<p>The marble jumps wildly between the states. By inspecting the graph with your eyes only, you don&#8217;t see any pattern in it, do you?</p>
<p>And finally, here is a simulation where the noise level seems to be about right to make the signal visible via a quasi-periodic motion:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/files/stochres_intermednoise.jpg" alt="high noise level" />
</div>
<p>Sometimes the marble makes a transition in phase with the force, sometimes it does not, sometimes it has a phase lag. It can even happen that the marble makes a transition while the force acts in the opposite direction!</p>
<p>Some members of the Azimuth crew have created an online model that calculates simulations of the model, for different values of the involved constants.  You can see it here:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.adgie.f9.co.uk/azimuth/stochastic-resonance/Javascript/StochasticResonanceEuler.html">Stochastic resonance example</a>, Azimuth Code Project.</p>
<p>We especially thank Allan Erskine and Jim Stuttard.</p>
<p>You can change the values using the sliders under the graphic and see what happens. You can also choose different &#8216;random seeds&#8217;, which means that the random numbers used in the simulation will be different.</p>
<p>Above, we asked if one could calculate for a fixed <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> the level of noise <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="D" class="latex" /> that maximizes the signal to noise ratio.  We have defined the model system, but we still need to define &#8216;signal to noise ratio&#8217; in order to address the question.</p>
<p>There is no general definition that makes sense for all kinds of systems. For our model system, let&#8217;s assume that the expectation value of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%28t%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x(t)" class="latex" /> has a Fourier expansion like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Clangle+x%28t%29+%5Crangle+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bn+%3D+-+%5Cinfty%7D%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D++M_n+%5Cexp%7B%28i+n+t%29%7D+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;langle x(t) &#92;rangle = &#92;sum_{n = - &#92;infty}^{&#92;infty}  M_n &#92;exp{(i n t)} } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Then one useful definition of the <b>signal to noise ratio</b> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ceta&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;eta" class="latex" /> is </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Ceta+%3A%3D+%5Cfrac%7B%7CM_1%7C%5E2%7D%7BA%5E2%7D%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;eta := &#92;frac{|M_1|^2}{A^2}} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>So, can one calculate the value of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="D," class="latex" /> depending on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> that maximizes <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ceta&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;eta" class="latex" />? We don&#8217;t know! Do you?</p>

<h3> For &uuml;bernerds only </h3>
<h4> Numerically solving stochastic differential equations</h4>
<p>Maybe you are asking yourself what is behind the <a href="http://www.adgie.f9.co.uk/azimuth/stochastic-resonance/Javascript/StochasticResonanceEuler.html">online model</a>? How does one &#8216;numerically solve&#8217; a stochastic differential equation and in what sense are the graphs that you see there &#8216;close&#8217; to the exact solution?  No problem, we will explain it here!</p>
<p>First, you need C code like this:</p>
<pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;math.h&gt;

#define znew ((z=36969*(z&amp;65535)+(z&gt;&gt;16)) &lt;&lt; 16)
#define wnew ((w = 18000*(w&amp;65535)+(w&gt;&gt;16))&amp;65535)

static unsigned long z = 362436069, w = 521288629;

float rnor() {
	float x, y, v;

	x = ((signed long) (znew + wnew)) * 1.167239E-9;

	if (fabs(x) &lt; 1.17741)
		return (x);

	y = (znew + wnew) * 2.328306E-10;

	if (log(y) &lt; 0.6931472 - 0.5 * x * x)
		return x;

	x = (x &gt; 0) ? 0.8857913 * (2.506628 - x) : -0.8857913 * (2.506628 + x);

	if (log(1.8857913 - y) &lt; 0.5718733 - 0.5 * (x * x))
		return (x);

	do {
		v = ((signed long) (znew + wnew)) * 4.656613E-10;

		x = -log(fabs(v)) * 0.3989423;

		y = -log((znew + wnew)* 2.328306E-10);

	} while (y + y &lt; x * x);

	return (v &gt; 0 ? 2.506628 + x : 2.506628 - x);
}

int main(void) {

	int index = 0;

	for(index = 0; index &lt; 10; index++) {

	}
	return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}

</pre>
<p>Pretty scary, huh? Do you see what it does? We don&#8217;t think anyone stands a chance to understand all the &#8216;magical constants&#8217; in it. We pasted it here so you can go around and show it to friends who claim that they know the programming language C and understand every program in seconds, and see what they can tell you about it. We&#8217;ll explain it below.</p>
<p>Since this section is for &uuml;bernerds, we will assume that you know stochastic processes in continuous time. Brownian motion on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}" class="latex" /> can be viewed as a probability distribution on the space of all continuous functions on a fixed interval, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C%5B0%2C+T%5D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C[0, T]." class="latex" /> This is also true for solutions of stochastic differential equations in general. A &#8216;numerical approximation&#8217; to a stochastic differential equation is an discrete time approximation that samples this probability space. </p>
<p>Another way to think about it is to start with numerical approximations of ordinary differential equations. When you are handed such an equation of the form</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7Bd+x%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D+f%28x%2C+t%29+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{d x}{d t} = f(x, t) }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>with an initial condition <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%280%29+%3D+x_0%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x(0) = x_0," class="latex" /> you know that there are different discrete approximation schemes to calculate an approximate solution to it. The simplest one is the Euler scheme. You need to choose a step size <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="h" class="latex" /> and calculate values for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> recursively using the formula</p>

<p>It is possible to extend some schemes from ordinary differential equations to stochastic differential equations that involve certain random variables in every step. The best textbook on the subject that I know is this one: </p>
<p>&bull; Peter E. Kloeden and Eckhard Platen, <i>Numerical Solution of Stochastic Differential Equations</i>, Springer, Berlin, 2010.  (<a href="http://www.zentralblatt-math.org/zmath/en/advanced/?q=an:0752.60043">ZMATH review</a>.)</p>
<p>The extension of the Euler scheme is very simple, deceptively so!  It is much less straightforward to determine the extensions of higher Runge&#8211;Kutta schemes, for example. You have been warned! The Euler scheme for stochastic differential equations of the form</p>

<p>is simply</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X_%7Bn+%2B+1%7D+%3D+X_n+%2B+f%28X_n%2C+t_n%29+%5C%3B+h+%2B+g%28X_n%2C+t_n%29+%5C%3B+w_n+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X_{n + 1} = X_n + f(X_n, t_n) &#92;; h + g(X_n, t_n) &#92;; w_n " class="latex" /></p>
<p>where all the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="w_n" class="latex" /> are independent random variables with a normal distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N%280%2C+h%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="N(0, h)." class="latex" />  If you write a computer program that calculates approximations using this scheme, you need a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator">pseudorandom number generator</a>. This is what the code we posted above is about. Actually, it is an efficient algorithm to calculate pseudorandom numbers with a normal distribution. It&#8217;s from this paper:</p>
<p>&bull; George Marsaglia and Wai Wan Tsang, The Monty Python method for generating random variables, <i><a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=292453">ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software</a></i> <b>24</b> (1998), 341&#8211;350.</p>
<p>While an approximation to an ordinary differential equation approximates a function, an approximation to a stochastic differential equation approximates a probability distribution on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C%5B0%2C+T%5D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C[0, T]." class="latex" />  So we need a different concept of &#8216;convergence&#8217; of the approximation for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h+%5Cto+0.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="h &#92;to 0." class="latex" /> The two most important ones are called &#8216;strong&#8217; and &#8216;weak&#8217; convergence.  </p>

<p>It is said to be of <b>strong order</b> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;gamma" class="latex" /> if there is a constant <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C" class="latex" /> such that</p>

<p>As we see from the definition, a strong approximation needs to approximate the path of the original process <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> at the end of the time interval <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5B0%2C+T%5D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="[0, T]." class="latex" /> </p>

<p>It is said to be of <b>weak order</b> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;gamma" class="latex" />  with respect to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="G" class="latex" /> if there is a constant <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C" class="latex" /> such that for every function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g+%5Cin+G&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="g &#92;in G" class="latex" />:</p>

<p>One speaks simply of &#8216;weak convergence&#8217; when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="G" class="latex" /> is the set of all polynomials.</p>
<p>So weak convergence means that the approximation needs to approximate the probability distribution of the original process <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X." class="latex" />  Weak and strong convergence are indeed different concepts.  For example, the Euler scheme is of strong order 0.5 and of weak order 1.0.</p>
<p>Our simple online model implements the Euler scheme to calculate approximations to our model equation. So now you know it what sense it is indeed an approximation to the solution process!</p>
<h4> Implementation details of the interactive online model </h4>
<p>There appear to be three main approaches to implementing an interactive online model. It is assumed that all the main browsers understand Javascript.</p>
<p>1) Implement the model using a server-side programme that produces graph data in response to parameter settings, and use Javascript in the browser to plot the graphs and provide interaction inputs.</p>
<p>2) Pre-compute the graph data for various sets of parameter values, send these graphs to the browser, and use Javascript to select a graph and plot it. The computation of the graph data can be done on the designers machine, using their preferred language.</p>
<p>3) Implement the model entirely in Javascript.</p>
<p>Option 1) is only practical if one can run interactive programs on the server. While there is technology to do this, it is not something that most ISPs or hosting companies provide. You might be provided with Perl and PHP, but neither of these is a language of choice for numeric coding.</p>
<p>Option 2) has been tried. The problem with this approach is the large amount of pre-computed data required. For example, if we have 4 independent parameters, each of which takes on 10 values, then we need 10000 graphs. Also, it is not practical to provide much finer control of each parameter, as this increases the data size even more.</p>
<p>Option 3) looked doable. Javascript has some nice language features, such as closures, which are a good fit for implementing numerical methods for solving ODEs. The main question then is whether a typical Javascript engine can cope with the compute load.</p>
<p>One problem that arose with a pure Javascript implementation is the production of normal random deviates required for the numerical solution of an SDE. Javascript has a random() function, that produces uniform random deviates, and there are algorithms that could be implemented in Javascript to produce normal deviates from uniform deviates. The problems here are that there is no guarantee that all Javascript engines use the same PRNG, or that the PRNG is actually any good, and we cannot set a specific seed in Javascript. Even if the PRNG is adequate, we have the problem that different users will see different outputs for the same parameter settings. Also, reloading the page will reseed the PRNG from some unknown source, so a user will not be able to replicate a particular output.</p>
<p>The chosen solution was to pre-compute a sequence of random normal deviates, using a PRNG of known characteristics. This sequence is loaded from the server, and will naturally be the same for all users and sessions. This is the C++ code used to create the fixed Javascript array:</p>
<pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
#include &lt;boost/random/mersenne_twister.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;boost/random/normal_distribution.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main(int argc, char * argv[])
{
    boost::mt19937 engine(1234); // PRNG with seed = 1234
    boost::normal_distribution&lt;double&gt; rng(0.0, 1.0); // Mean 0.0, standard deviation 1.0
    std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;normals = [\n&quot;;
    int nSamples = 10001;
    while(nSamples--)
    {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; rng(engine) &lt;&lt; &quot;,\n&quot;;
    }
    std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;];&quot;;
}
</pre>
<p>Deviates with a standard deviation other than 1.0 can be produced in Javascript by multiplying the pre-computed deviates by a suitable scaling factor.</p>
<p>The graphs only use 1000 samples from the Javascript array. To see the effects of different sample paths, the Javascript code selects one of ten slices from the pre-computed array. </p>

				<small>13 April, 2012</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>This week I&#8217;m trying something new: including a climate model that runs on your web browser!  </p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a realistic model; we&#8217;re just getting started.  But some programmers in the Azimuth Project team are interested in making more such models&mdash;especially Allan Erskine (who made this one), Jim Stuttard (who helped me get it to work), Glyn Adgie and Staffan Liljgeren.  It could be a fun way for us to learn and explain climate physics.  With enough of these models, we&#8217;d have a whole online course!  If you want to help us out, please say hi.</p>
<p>Allan will say more about the programming challenges later.  But first, a big puzzle: how can small changes in the Earth&#8217;s orbit lead to big changes in the Earth&#8217;s climate?  As I mentioned <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week318.html">last time</a>, it seems hard to understand the glacial cycles of the last few million years without answering this.</p>
<p>Are there feedback mechanisms that can amplify small changes in temperature?  Yes.  Here are a few obvious ones:</p>
<p>&bull; <b><a href="http://geotest.tamu.edu/userfiles/216/dessler09.pdf">Water vapor feedback</a></b>.  When it gets warmer, more water evaporates, and the air becomes more humid. But water vapor is a greenhouse gas, which causes additional warming.  Conversely, when the Earth cools down, the air becomes drier, so the greenhouse effect becomes weaker, which tends to cool things down.</p>
<p>&bull; <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice-albedo_feedback">Ice albedo feedback</a>.</b>  Snow and ice reflect more light than liquid oceans or soil.  When the Earth warms up, snow and ice melt, so the Earth becomes darker, absorbs more light, and tends to get get even warmer.  Conversely, when the Earth cools down, more snow and ice form, so the Earth becomes lighter, absorbs less light, and tends to get even cooler.</p>
<p>&bull; <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_feedback#CO2_in_the_oceans">Carbon dioxide solubility feedback</a>.</b>  Cold water can hold more carbon dioxide than warm water: that&#8217;s why opening a warm can of soda can be so explosive.  So, when the Earth&#8217;s oceans warm up, they release carbon dioxide.  But carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, which causes additional warming.  Conversely, when the oceaans cool down, they absorb more carbon dioxide, so the greenhouse effect becomes weaker, which tends to cool things down.</p>
<p>Of course, there are also negative feedbacks: otherwise the climate would be utterly unstable!  There are also complicated feedbacks whose overall effect is harder to evaluate:</p>
<p>&bull; <b>Planck feedback.</b>  A hotter world radiates more heat, which cools it down.  This is the big negative feedback that keeps all the positive feedbacks from making the Earth insanely hot or insanely cold.</p>
<p>&bull; <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_feedback">Cloud feedback</a>.</b> A warmer Earth has more clouds, which reflect more light but also increase the greenhouse effect. </p>
<p>&bull; <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_feedback#Lapse_rate">Lapse rate feedback</a>.</b>   An increased greenhouse effect changes the vertical temperature profile of the atmosphere, which has effects of its own&mdash;but this works differently near the poles and near the equator.    </p>
<p>See <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week302.html">week302</a> for more on feedbacks and how big they&#8217;re likely to be.  </p>
<p>On top of all these subtleties, any proposed solution to the puzzle of glacial cycles needs to keep a few other things in mind, too:</p>
<p>&bull; A really good theory will explain, not just why we have glacial cycles now, but why we didn&#8217;t have them earlier.  As I explained in <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week317.html">week317</a>, they got started around 5 million years ago, became much colder around 2 million years ago, and switched from a roughly 41,000 year cycle to a roughly 100,000 year cycle around 1 million years ago.</p>
<p>&bull; Say we dream up a whopping big positive feedback mechanism that does a great job of keeping the Earth warm when it&#8217;s warm and cold when it&#8217;s cold.  If this effect is strong enough, the Earth may be <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bistability">bistable</a></b>: it will have two stable states, a warm one and a cold one.  Unfortunately, if the effect is <i>too</i> strong, it won&#8217;t be easy for the Earth to pop back and forth between these two states!</p>
<p>The classic example of a bistable system is a switch&mdash;say for an electric light.  When the light is on it stays on; when the light is off it stays off.  If you touch the switch very gently, nothing will happen.  But if you push on it hard enough, it will suddenly pop from on to off, or vice versa.  </p>
<p>If we&#8217;re trying to model the glacial cycles using this idea, we need the switch to have a fairly dramatic effect, yet <i>still be responsive to a fairly gentle touch</i>.  For this to work we need enough positive feedback&#8230; but <i>not too much</i>.</p>
<p>(We could also try a different idea: maybe the Earth keeps itself in its icy glacial state, or its warm interglacial state, using some mechanism that gradually uses something up.  Then, when the Earth runs out of this stuff, whatever it is, the climate can easily flip to the other state.)</p>
<p>We must always remember that to a good approximation, the total amount of sunlight hitting the Earth each year does not change as the Earth&#8217;s orbit changes in the so-called &#8216;Milankovich cycles&#8217; that seem to be causing the ice ages.  I explained why <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/318.html">last time</a>.  What changes is not the total amount of sunlight, but something much subtler: the amount of sunlight at <i>particular latitudes</i> in <i>particular seasons!</i>  In particular, Milankovitch claimed, and most scientists believe, that the Earth tends to get cold when there&#8217;s little sunlight hitting the far northern latitudes in summer. </p>
<p>For these and other reasons, any solution to the ice age puzzle is bound to be subtle.  Instead of diving straight into this complicated morass, let&#8217;s try something much simpler.  Let&#8217;s just think about how the ice albedo effect could, in theory, make the Earth bistable.</p>
<p>To do this, let&#8217;s look at the very simplest model in this great not-yet-published book:</p>
<p>&bull; Gerald R. North, <i>Simple Models of Global Climate</i>.</p>
<p>This is a <b>zero-dimensional energy balance model</b>, meaning that it only involves the average temperature of the earth, the average solar radiation coming in, and the average infrared radiation going out.</p>
<p>The average temperature will be <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T," class="latex" /> measured in Celsius.  We&#8217;ll assume the Earth radiates power square meter equal to</p>

<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+%3D+218&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A = 218" class="latex" /> watts/meter<sup>2</sup> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B+%3D+1.90&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B = 1.90" class="latex" /> watts/meter<sup>2</sup> per degree Celsius.  This is a linear approximation taken from satellite data on our Earth.  In reality, the power emitted grows faster than linearly with temperature.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll assume the Earth absorbs solar energy power per square meter equal to</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q+c%28T%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Q c(T) " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Here:</p>
<p>&bull; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Q" class="latex" /> is the average <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insolation">insolation</a></b>: that is, the amount of solar power per square meter hitting the top of the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere, averaged over location and time of year. In reality <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Q" class="latex" /> is about 341.5 watts/meter<sup>2</sup>.  This is one quarter of the <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Solar%20radiation"><b>solar constant</b></a>, meaning the solar power per square meter that would hit a panel hovering in space above the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere and facing directly at the Sun.  (Why a quarter?  That&#8217;s a nice geometry puzzle: we worked it out at the <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/10/11/geometry-puzzle/">Azimuth Blog</a> once.)</p>
<p>&bull; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%28T%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c(T)" class="latex" /> is the <b>coalbedo</b>: the fraction of solar power that gets absorbed.  The coalbedo depends on the temperature; we&#8217;ll have to say how.</p>
<p>Given all this, we get</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+C+%5Cfrac%7Bd+T%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D+-+A+-+B+T+%2B+Q+c%28T%28t%29%29+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ C &#92;frac{d T}{d t} = - A - B T + Q c(T(t)) }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C" class="latex" /> is Earth&#8217;s heat capacity in joules per degree per square meter.  Of course this is a funny thing, because heat energy is stored not only at the surface but also in the air and/or water, and the details vary a lot depending on where we are.  But if we consider a uniform planet with dry air and no ocean, North says we may roughly take <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C" class="latex" /> equal to about half the heat capacity at constant pressure of the column of dry air over a square meter, namely 5 million joules per degree Celsius.</p>
<p>The easiest thing to do is find equilibrium solutions, meaning solutions where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7Bd+T%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D+0%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;frac{d T}{d t} = 0," class="latex" /> so that</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+%2B+B+T+%3D+Q+c%28T%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A + B T = Q c(T) " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Now <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C" class="latex" /> doesn&#8217;t matter anymore!  We&#8217;d like to solve for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T" class="latex" /> as a function of the insolation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Q," class="latex" /> but it&#8217;s easier to solve for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Q" class="latex" /> as a function of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T" class="latex" />:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+Q+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B+A+%2B+B+T+%7D+%7Bc%28T%29%7D+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ Q = &#92;frac{ A + B T } {c(T)} }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>To go further, we need to guess some formula for the coalbedo <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%28T%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c(T)." class="latex" /> The coalbedo, remember, is the fraction of sunlight that gets absorbed when it hits the Earth.  It&#8217;s 1 minus the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo"><b>albedo</b></a>, which is the fraction that gets reflected.  Here&#8217;s a little chart of albedos:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Albedo-e_hg.svg/429px-Albedo-e_hg.svg.png" /></a></div>
<p>If you get mixed up between albedo and coalbedo, just remember: coal has a high coalbedo.</p>
<p>Since we&#8217;re trying to keep things very simple right not, <i>not</i> model nature in all its glorious complexity, let&#8217;s just say the average albedo of the Earth is 0.65 when it&#8217;s very cold and there&#8217;s lots of snow.  So, let</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_i+%3D+1++-+0.65+%3D++0.35+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c_i = 1  - 0.65 =  0.35 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>be the &#8216;<b>i</b>cy&#8217; coalbedo, good for very low temperatures.  Similarly, let&#8217;s say the average albedo drops to 0.3 when its very hot and the Earth is darker.  So, let </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_f+%3D+1+-+0.3+%3D+0.7+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c_f = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>be the &#8216;ice-<b>f</b>ree&#8217; coalbedo, good for high temperatures when the Earth is darker.  </p>
<p>Then, we need a function of temperature that interpolates between <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c_i" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_f.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c_f." class="latex" />  Let&#8217;s try this:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%28T%29+%3D+c_i+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D+%28c_f-c_i%29+%281+%2B+%5Ctanh%28%5Cgamma+T%29%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c(T) = c_i + &#92;frac{1}{2} (c_f-c_i) (1 + &#92;tanh(&#92;gamma T)) " class="latex" /></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not a fan of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_function">hyperbolic tangent</a> function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctanh%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;tanh," class="latex" /> this may seem scary.  But don&#8217;t be intimidated!</p>
<p>The function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%281+%2B+%5Ctanh%28%5Cgamma+T%29%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;frac{1}{2}(1 + &#92;tanh(&#92;gamma T)) " class="latex" /> is just a function that goes smoothly from 0 at low temperatures to 1 at high temperatures.  This ensures that the coalbedo is near its icy value <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c_i" class="latex" /> at low temperatures, and near its ice-free value <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c_f" class="latex" /> at high temperatures.  But the fun part here is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;gamma," class="latex" /> a parameter that says how rapidly the coalbedo rises as the Earth gets warmer.  Depending on this, we&#8217;ll get different effects!</p>
<p>The function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%28T%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c(T)" class="latex" /> rises fastest at <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T+%3D+0%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T = 0," class="latex" /> since that&#8217;s where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctanh+%28%5Cgamma+T%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;tanh (&#92;gamma T)" class="latex" /> has the biggest slope.  We&#8217;re just lucky that in Celsius <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T+%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T = 0" class="latex" /> is the melting point of ice, so this makes a bit of sense.</p>
<p>Now Allan Erskine&#8217;s programming magic comes into play!  Unfortunately it doesn&#8217;t work on this blog&mdash;yet!&mdash;so please hop over to the version of this article <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week319.html">on my website</a> to see it in action.  </p>
<p>You can slide a slider to adjust the parameter <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;gamma" class="latex" /> to various values between 0 and 1.  </p>
<p>You can then see how the coalbedo <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%28T%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c(T)" class="latex" /> changes as a function of the temperature <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T." class="latex" /> In this graph the temperature ranges from -50 &deg;C and 50 &deg;C; the graph depends on what value of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;gamma" class="latex" /> you choose with slider.</p>
<p>You can also see how the insolation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Q" class="latex" /> required to yield a given temperature <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T" class="latex" /> between -50 &deg;C and 50 &deg;C:</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easiest to solve for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Q" class="latex" /> in terms of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T." class="latex" />  But it&#8217;s more intuitive to flip this graph over and see what equilibrium temperatures <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T" class="latex" /> are allowed for a given insolation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Q" class="latex" /> between 200 and 500 watts per square mater.</p>
<p>The exciting thing is that when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;gamma" class="latex" /> gets big enough, <i>three different temperatures are compatible with the same amount of insolation!</i>  This means the Earth can be hot, cold or something intermediate even when the amount of sunlight hitting it is fixed.  The intermediate state is unstable, it turns out.  Only the hot and cold states are stable.  So, we say the Earth is <b>bistable</b> in this simplified model.</p>
<p>Can you see how big <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;gamma" class="latex" /> needs to be for this bistability to kick in?  It&#8217;s certainly there when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma+%3D+0.05%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;gamma = 0.05," class="latex" /> since then we get a graph like this:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week319_temperature_versus_insolation.jpg" />
</div>
<p>When the insolation is less than about 385 W/m<sup>2</sup> there&#8217;s only a cold state.  When it hits 385 W/m<sup>2</sup>, as shown by the <font color="green"><b>green line</b></font>, suddenly there are two possible temperatures: a cold one and a much hotter one.  When the insolation is higher, as shown by the <b>black line</b>, there are three possible temperatures: a cold one, and unstable intermediate one, and a hot one.  And when the insolation gets above 465 W/m<sup>2</sup>, as shown by the <font color="red"><b>red line</b></font>, there&#8217;s only a hot state!</p>
<p>Why is the intermediate state unstable when it exists?  Why are the other two equilibria stable?  To answer these questions, we&#8217;d need to go back and study the original equation:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C+%5Cfrac%7Bd+T%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D+-+A+-+B+T+%2B+Q+c%28T%28t%29%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C &#92;frac{d T}{d t} = - A - B T + Q c(T(t)) " class="latex" /></p>
<p>and see what happens when we push <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T" class="latex" /> slightly away from one of its equilibrium values.  That&#8217;s really fun, but we won&#8217;t do it today.  Instead, let&#8217;s draw some conclusions from what we&#8217;ve just seen.  There are at least three morals: a mathematical moral, a climate science model, and a software moral.</p>
<p>Mathematically, this model illustrates catastrophe theory.  As we slowly turn up <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;gamma," class="latex" /> we get different curves showing how temperature is a function of insolation&#8230; until suddenly the curve isn&#8217;t the graph of a function anymore: it becomes infinitely steep at one point!  After that, we get bistability:</p>

<p>This is called a <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catastrophe_theory#Cusp_catastrophe">cusp catastrophe</a></b>, and you can visualize these curves as slices of a surface in 3d, which looks roughly like this picture:</p>

<p>from here:</p>
<p>&bull; Wolfram Mathworld, <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CuspCatastrophe.html">Cusp catastrophe</a>.  (Includes Mathematica package.)</p>
<p>The cusp catastrophe is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_stability">&#8216;structurally stable&#8217;</a>, meaning that small perturbations don&#8217;t change its qualitative behavior.  This concept is made precise in catastrophe theory.  It&#8217;s a useful concept, because it focuses our attention on <i>robust</i> features of models: features that don&#8217;t go away if the model is slightly wrong, as it always is.</p>
<p>As far as climate science goes, one moral is that it pays to spend some time making sure we understand simple models before we dive into more complicated ones.  Right now we&#8217;re looking at a <i>very</i> simple model, but we&#8217;re already seeing some interesting phenomena.  The kind of model we&#8217;re looking at now is called a <b>Budyko-Sellers model</b>. These have been studied since the late 1960&#8217;s:</p>

Atmos. Sci.</a></i> <b>36</b> (1979), 255-259.</p>
<p>It also pays to compare our models to reality!   For example, the graphs we&#8217;ve seen show some remarkably hot and cold temperatures for the Earth.  That&#8217;s a bit unnerving.  Let&#8217;s investigate.  Suppose we set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma+%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;gamma = 0" class="latex" /> on our slider.  Then the coalbedo of the Earth becomes independent of temperature: it&#8217;s 0.525, halfway between its icy and ice-free values.  Then, when the insolation takes its actual value of 342.5 watts per square meter, the model says the Earth&#8217;s temperature is very chilly: about -20 &deg;C!</p>
<p>Does that mean the model is fundamentally flawed?  Maybe not!  After all, it&#8217;s based on very light-colored Earth.  Suppose we use the <i>actual</i> albedo of the Earth.  Of course that&#8217;s hard to define, much less determine.  But let&#8217;s just look up some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo#Terrestrial_albedo">average value of the Earth&#8217;s albedo</a>: supposedly it&#8217;s about 0.3.  That gives a coalbedo of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+%3D+0.7.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c = 0.7." class="latex" />  If we plug that in our formula:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+Q+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B+A+%2B+B+T+%7D+%7Bc%7D+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ Q = &#92;frac{ A + B T } {c} }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>we get 11 &deg;C.  That&#8217;s not too far from the Earth&#8217;s actual average temperature, namely about 15 &deg; C.   So the chilly temperature of -20 &deg;C seems to come from an Earth that&#8217;s a lot lighter in color than ours.  </p>
<p>Our model includes the greenhouse effect, since the coeficients <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B" class="latex" /> were determined by satellite measurements of how much radiation actually escapes the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere and shoots out into space.  As a further check to our model, we can look at an even <i>simpler</i> zero-dimensional energy balance model: a completely black Earth with no greenhouse effect.  Another member of the Azimuth Project has written about this:</p>
<p>&bull; Tim van Beek, <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/06/19/putting-the-earth-in-a-box/">Putting the Earth in a box</a>, <i>Azimuth</i>, 19 June 2011.</p>
<p>&bull; Tim van Beek, <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/07/02/a-quantum-of-warmth/">A quantum of warmth</a>, <i>Azimuth</i>, 2 July 2011.</p>
<p>As he explains, this model gives the Earth a temperature of 6 &deg;C.  He also shows that in this model, lowering the albedo to a realistic value of 0.3 lowers the temperature to a chilly -18 &deg; C.  To get from that to something like our Earth, we must take the greenhouse effect into account.</p>
<p>This sort of fiddling around is the sort of thing we must do to study the flaws and virtues of a climate model.  Of course, any <i>realistic</i> climate model is vastly more sophisticated than the little toy we&#8217;ve been looking at, so the &#8216;fiddling around&#8217; must also be more sophisticated.  With a more sophisticated model, we can also be more demanding.  For example, when I said 11 &deg;C is &#8220;is not too far from the Earth&#8217;s actual average temperature, namely about 15 &deg; C&#8221;, I was being very blas&eacute; about what&#8217;s actually a big discrepancy.  I only took that attitude because the calculations we&#8217;re doing now are very preliminary.   </p>
<p>Finally, here&#8217;s what Allan has to say about the software you&#8217;ve just seen, and some fancier software you&#8217;ll see in forthcoming weeks:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Your original question in the Azimuth Forum was &#8220;What&#8217;s the easiest way to write simple programs of this sort that could be accessed and operated by clueless people online?&#8221;  A &#8220;simple program&#8221; for the climate model you proposed needed two elements:  a means to solve the ODE (ordinary differential equation) describing the model, and a means to interact with and visualize the results for the (clearly) &#8220;clueless people online&#8221;.</p>
<p>Some good suggestions were made by members of the forum:</p>
<p>&bull; use a full-fledged numerical computing package such as Sage or Matlab which come loaded to the teeth with ODE solvers and interactive charting;</p>
<p>&bull; use a full-featured programming language like Java which has libraries available for ode solving and charting, and which can be packaged as an applet for the web;</p>
<p>&bull; do all the computation and visualization ourselves in Javascript.</p>
<p>While the first two suggestions were superior for computing the ODE solutions, I knew from bitter experience (as a software developer) that the truly clueless people were us bold forum members engaged in this new online enterprise:  none of us were experts in this interactive/online math thing, and programming new software is almost always harder than you expect it to be.</p>
<p>Then actually releasing new software is harder still!  Especially to an audience as large as your readership.  To come up an interactive solution that would work on many different computers/browsers, the most mundane and pedestrian suggestion of &#8220;do it all ourselves in Javascript and have them run it in the browser&#8221; was also the most likely to be a success.</p>
<p>The issue with Javascript was that not many people use it for numerical computation, and I was down on our chances of success until Staffan pointed out the excellent <a href="http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/wp/">JSXGraph software</a>.   JSXGraph has many examples available to get up and running, has an ODE solver, and after a copy/paste or two and some tweaking on my part we were all set.</p>
<p>The true vindication for going all-Javascript though was that you were subsequently able to do some copy/pasting of your own directly into TWF without any servers needing configured etc., or even any help from me!  The graphs ought to be viewable by your readership for as long as browsers support Javascript (a sign of a good software release is that you don&#8217;t have to think about it afterwards).</p>
<p>There are some improvements I would make to how we handle future projects which we have discussed in the Forum.  Foremost, using Javascript to do all our numerical work is not going to attract the best and brightest minds from the forum (or elsewhere) to help with subsequent models.  My personal hope is that we allow all the numerical work to be done in whatever language people feel productive with, and that we come up with a slick way for you to embed and interact with just the data from these models in your webpages.  Glyn Adgie and Jim Stuttard seem to have some great momentum in this direction.</p>
<p>Or perhaps creating and editing interactive math online will eventually become as easy as wiki pages are today&mdash;I know Staffan had said the Sage developers were looking to make their online workbooks more interactive.  Also the bright folks behind the <a href="http://julialang.org/">new Julia language</a> are discussing ways to run (and presumably interact with) Julia in the cloud.  So perhaps we should just have dragged our feet on this project for a few years for all this cool stuff to help us out!  (And let&#8217;s wait for the Singularity while we&#8217;re at it.)
</p></blockquote>
<p>No, let&#8217;s not!  I hope you programmers out there can help us find good solutions to the problems Allan faced.  And I hope some of you actually join the team.</p>
<p>By the way, Allan has a somewhat spiffier version of the same Budyko-Sellers model <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/coalbedo/coalbedo_new.html">here</a>.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>A while ago I gave a talk at Google.  Since I think we should cut unnecessary travel, I decided to stay here in Singapore and give the talk virtually, in the form of a <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/01/24/i-robot/">robot</a>:</p>
<div align="center"><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="450" height="259" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kewoOzys2AU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span></div>
<p>I thank <a href="http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~mike/">Mike Stay</a> for arranging this talk at Google, and <a href="http://tlb.org/">Trevor Blackwell</a> and Suzanne Broctao at <a href="https://www.anybots.com/">Anybots</a> for letting me use one of their robots! </p>
<p>Here are the slides:</p>

<p>To see the source of any piece of information in these slides, just click on it!  </p>
<p>And here&#8217;s me:</p>

</div>
<p>This talk was more ambitious than previous ones I&#8217;ve given&#8212;and not just because I was struggling to operate a robot, read my slides on my laptop, talk, and click the pages forward all at once!  I said more about <i>solutions</i> to our problems this time.  That&#8217;s where I want to head, but of course it&#8217;s infinitely harder to describe solutions than to list problems or even to convince people that they really <i>are</i> problems. </p>

					<p><a href="http://plus.google.com/u/0/117663015413546257905/posts/LR1cDNViBgd">Over on Google+</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/105888615414982242080/posts">Daniel Lemire</a> writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The IPCC predictions from 1990 went for a probable rise of the global mean temperature of 0.3 &deg;C per decade and at least 0.2 &deg;C per decade. See the IPPC assessment overview document, Section 1.0.3. (It is available online <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/publications_ipcc_90_92_assessments_far.shtml">here</a>.) We have had two decades. Fact: they predicted more warming than what actually materialized. Quite a bit more. See:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_temperature_record">Instrumental temperature record</a>, Wikipedia.
</p></blockquote>
<p>What&#8217;s the full story here?  Here are some basic facts.  The policymaker summary of the 1990 report estimates:</p>
<blockquote><p>
under the IPCC Business-as-Usual (Scenario A) emissions of greenhouse gases, a rate of increase of global-mean temperature during the next century of about 0.3 °C per decade (with an uncertainty range of 0.2 °C to 0.5 °C per decade); this is greater than that seen over the past 10,000 years. This will result in a likely increase in global-mean temperature of about 1°C above the present value by 2025 and 3°C before the end of the next century. The rise will not be steady because of the influence of other factors&#8230;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I believe we are going along with the &#8216;business-as-usual&#8217; emissions of greenhouse gases.  On the other hand, Wikipedia shows a figure from <a href="http://www.globalwarmingart.com/wiki/File:Instrumental_Temperature_Record_png">Global Warming Art</a>:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://www.globalwarmingart.com/wiki/File:Instrumental_Temperature_Record_png"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.globalwarmingart.com/images/thumb/f/f4/Instrumental_Temperature_Record.png/450px-Instrumental_Temperature_Record.png" /></a>
</div>
<p>based on NASA GISS data <a href="http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs_v3/Fig.A2.txt">here</a>.  In 1990, the 5-year mean Global Land-Ocean Temperature Index was .27, meaning .27 &deg;C above the mean temperature from 1961 to 1990.  By 2006, the 5-year mean was .54.  </p>
<p>So, that&#8217;s a .27 &deg;C increase in 16 years, or about .17 &deg;C per decade.  This is slightly less than the bottom-end estimate of 0.2 &deg;C per decade, and about half the expected rise of 0.3 &deg;C per decade.  </p>
<p>Is there any official story on why the 1990 IPCC report overestimated the temperature rise during this time?  In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPCC_Fourth_Assessment_Report#Model-based_projections_for_the_future">2007</a> the IPCC estimated a temperature rise of about 0.2 °C per decade for the next two decades for all the scenarios they considered.  So, it seems somehow 0.3 &deg;C went down to 0.2 °C.  What was wrong with the original estimate?</p>

					<h3>Or: waves that take the shortest path through infinity</h3>
<p><i>guest post by <b><a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Tim+van+Beek">Tim van Beek</a></b></i></p>
<p>Water waves can do a lot of things that light waves cannot, like &#8220;breaking&#8221;:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/files/BreakingWaveNextTry.jpg" alt="breaking wave" />
</div>
<p>In mathematical models this difference shows up through the kind of partial differential equation (PDE) that models the waves: </p>
<p>&bull; light waves are modelled by <i>linear</i> equations while</p>
<p>&bull; water waves are modelled by <i>nonlinear</i> equations.</p>
<p>Physicists like to point out that linear equations model things that do not interact, while nonlinear equations model things that interact with each other. In quantum field theory, people speak of &#8220;free fields&#8221; versus &#8220;interacting fields&#8221;.   </p>
<p>Some nonlinear PDE that describe fluid flows turn out to also describe geodesics on infinite-dimensional Riemannian manifolds.  This fascinating observation is due to the Russian mathematician <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Arnold">Vladimir Arnold</a>. In this blog post I would like to talk a little bit about the concepts involved and show you a little toy example.</p>
<h4>Fluid Flow modelled by Diffeomorphisms</h4>
<p>The Euler viewpoint on fluids is that a fluid is made of tiny &#8220;packages&#8221; or &#8220;particles&#8221;. The fluid flow is described by specifying where each package or particle is at a given time <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="t" class="latex" />.  When we start at some time <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t_0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="t_0" class="latex" /> on a given manifold <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="M" class="latex" />, the flow of every fluid package is described by a path on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="M" class="latex" /> parametrized by time, and for every time <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t+%3E+t_0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="t &gt; t_0" class="latex" /> there is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffeomorphism">diffeomorphism</a> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g%5Et+%3A+tiM+%5Cto+M&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="g^t : tiM &#92;to M" class="latex" /> defined by the requirement that it maps the initial position <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> of each fluid package to its position <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g%5Et%28x%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="g^t(x)" class="latex" /> at time <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="t" class="latex" />:</p>

<p>&bull; V.I. Arnold and B.A. Khesin, <i>Topological Methods in Hydrodynamics</i>, Springer, Berlin, 1998.   (<a href="http://www.zentralblatt-math.org/zmath/en/advanced/?q=an:0902.76001&amp;format=complete">Review at Zentralblatt Mathematik</a>.)</p>
<p>We will take as a model of the domain of the fluid flow a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space">compact</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_manifold">Riemannian manifold</a> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="M" class="latex" />. A fluid flow, as pictured above, is then a path in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffeomorphism#Diffeomorphism_group">diffeomorphism group</a> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BDiff%7D%28M%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{Diff}(M)" class="latex" />. In order to apply geometric concepts in this situation, we will have to turn <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BDiff%7D%28M%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{Diff}(M)" class="latex" /> or some closed subgroup of it into a manifold, which will be infinite dimensional. </p>
<p>The curvature of such a manifold can provide a great deal about the stability of fluid flows: On a manifold with negative curvature geodesics will diverge from each other. If we can model fluid flows as geodesics in a Riemannian manifold and calculate the curvature, we could try to infer a bound on weather forecasts (in fact, that is what Vladimir Arnold did!): The solution that you calculate is one geodesic. But if you take into account errors with determining your starting point (involving the measurement of the state of the flow at the given start time), what you are actually looking at is a bunch of geodesics starting in a neighborhood of your starting point. If they diverge fast, that means that measurement errors make your result unreliable fast.  </p>
<p>If you never thought about manifolds in infinite dimensions, you may feel a little bit insecure as to how the concepts that you know from differential geometry can be generalized from finite dimensions. At least I felt this way when I first read about it. But it turns out that the part of the theory one needs to know in order to understand Arnold&#8217;s insight is not that scary, so I will talk a little bit about it next. </p>
<h4>What you should know about infinite-dimensional manifolds</h4>
<p>The basic strategy when handling finite-dimensional, smooth, real manifolds is that you have a complicated manifold <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="M" class="latex" />, but also locally for every point <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p+%5Cin+M&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p &#92;in M" class="latex" /> a neighborhood <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=U&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="U" class="latex" /> and an isomorphism (a &#8220;chart&#8221;) of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=U&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="U" class="latex" /> to an open subset of the  vastly simpler space <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5En&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}^n" class="latex" />, the &#8220;model space&#8221;. These isomorphisms can be used to transport concepts from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5En&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}^n" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="M" class="latex" />. In infinite dimensions it is however not that clear what kind of model space <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="E" class="latex" /> should be taken in place of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5En&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}^n" class="latex" />. What structure should <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="E" class="latex" /> have? </p>
<p>Since we would like to differentiate, we should for example be able to define the derivative of a curve in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="E" class="latex" />:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma%3A+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D+%5Cto+E++&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;gamma: &#92;mathbb{R} &#92;to E  " class="latex" />  </p>
<p>If we write down the usual formula for a derivative</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma%27%28t_0%29+%3A%3D+%5Clim_%7Bt+%5Cto+0%7D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bt%7D+%28%5Cgamma%28t_0+%2Bt%29+-+%5Cgamma%28t_0%29%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;gamma&#039;(t_0) := &#92;lim_{t &#92;to 0} &#92;frac{1}{t} (&#92;gamma(t_0 +t) - &#92;gamma(t_0)) " class="latex" /> </p>
<p>we see that to make sense of this we need to be able to add elements, have a scalar multiplication, and a topology such that the algebraic operations are continuous. Sets <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="E" class="latex" /> with this structure are called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_vector _space">topological vector  spaces</a>. </p>
<p>A curve that has a first derivative, second derivative, third derivative&#8230; and so on at every point is called a <b>smooth curve</b>, just as in the finite dimensional case.</p>
<p>So <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="E" class="latex" /> should at least be a topological vector  space. We can, of course, put more structure on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="E" class="latex" /> to make it &#8220;more similar&#8221; to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5En&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}^n" class="latex" />, and choose as model space in ascending order of generality:</p>
<p>1) A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space">Hilbert space</a>, which has an inner product,</p>
<p>2) a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_space">Banach space</a> that does not have a inner product, but a norm,</p>
<p>3) a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9chet_space">Fréchet space</a> that does not have a norm, but a metric,</p>
<p>4) a general <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_vector _space">topological vector  space</a> that need not be metrizable.</p>
<p>People talk accordingly of Hilbert, Banach and Fréchet manifolds. Since the space <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D%28%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5En%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C^{&#92;infty}(&#92;mathbb{R}^n)" class="latex" /> consisting of smooth maps from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5En&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}^n" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}" class="latex" /> is not a Banach space but a Fréchet space, we should not expect that we can model diffeomorphism groups on Banach spaces, but on Fréchet spaces.  So we will use the concept of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9chet_manifold">Fréchet manifolds</a>.</p>
<p>But if you are interested in a more general theory using locally convex topological vector  spaces as model spaces, you can look it up here:</p>
<p>&bull; Andreas Kriegl and Peter W. Michor, <i><a href="http://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~michor/apbookh-ams.pdf">The Convenient Setting of Global Analysis</a></i>, American Mathematical Society, Providence Rhode Island, 1999.</p>
<p>Note that Kriegl and Michor use a different definition of &#8220;smooth function of Fréchet spaces&#8221; than we will below. </p>
<p>If you learn functional analysis, you will most likely start with operators on Hilbert spaces. One could say that the theory of topological vector  spaces is about abstracting away as much structure from a Hilbert space and look what structure you need for important theorems to still hold true, like the open mapping/closed graph theorem. If you would like to learn more about this, my favorite book is this one:</p>
<p>&bull; Francois Treves, <i>Topological vector  Spaces, Distributions and Kernels</i>, Dover Publications, 2006.</p>
<p>Since we replace the model space <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5En&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}^n" class="latex" /> with a Fréchet space <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="E" class="latex" />, there will be certain things that won&#8217;t work out as easily as for the finite dimensional <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5En&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}^n" class="latex" />, or not at all.  </p>
<p>It is nevertheless possible to define both integrals and differentials that behave much in the expected way. You can find a nice exposition of how this can be done in this paper:</p>
<p>&bull; Richard S. Hamilton, The inverse function theorem of Nash and Moser, <i>Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society</i> <b>7</b> (1982), pages 65-222.</p>
<p>The story starts with the definition of the directional derivative that can be done just as in finite dimensions:</p>
<p>Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="G" class="latex" /> be Fréchet spaces, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=U+%5Csubseteq+F&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="U &#92;subseteq F" class="latex" /> open and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%3A+U+%5Cto+G&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="P: U &#92;to G" class="latex" /> a continuous map. The derivative of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="P" class="latex" /> at the point <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f+%5Cin+U&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f &#92;in U" class="latex" /> in the direction <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h+%5Cin+F&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="h &#92;in F" class="latex" /> is the map</p>

<p>It is possible to define higher derivatives and also prove that the chain rule holds, so that we can define that a function between Fréchet spaces is <b>smooth</b> if it has derivatives at every point of all orders. The definition of a smooth Fréchet manifold is then straightforward: you can copy the usual definition of a smooth manifold word for word, replacing <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5En&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}^n" class="latex" /> by some Fréchet space.  </p>
<p>With tangent vector s, you may remember that there are several different ways to define them in the finite dimensional case, which turn out to be equivalent. Since there are situations in infinite dimensions where these definitions turn out to <i>not</i> be equivalent, I will be explicit and define tangent vector s in the &#8220;kinematic way&#8221;:</p>
<p>The (kinematic) <b>tangent vector  space</b> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_p+M&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T_p M" class="latex" /> of a Fréchet manifold <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="M" class="latex" /> at a point <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p" class="latex" /> consists of all pairs <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28p%2C+c%27%280%29%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(p, c&#039;(0))" class="latex" /> where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c" class="latex" /> is a smooth curve</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%3A+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D+%5Cto+M+%5C%3B+%5Ctextrm%7B%5C%3B+with%5C%3B+%7D++c%280%29+%3D+p+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c: &#92;mathbb{R} &#92;to M &#92;; &#92;textrm{&#92;; with&#92;; }  c(0) = p " class="latex" /></p>
<p>With this definition, the set of pairs <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28p%2C+c%27%280%29%29%2C+p+%5Cin+M&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(p, c&#039;(0)), p &#92;in M" class="latex" /> forms a Fréchet manifold, the tangent bundle <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T+M&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T M" class="latex" />, just as in finite dimensions.</p>
<p>The first serious (more or less) problem we encounter is the definition of the <i>cotangent bundle</i>: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5En&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}^n" class="latex" /> is isomorphic to its dual vector  space. This is still true for every Hilbert space (this is known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riesz_representation_theorem">Riesz representation theorem</a>). It fails already for Banach spaces: The dual space will still be a Banach space, but a Banach space does not need to be isomorphic to its dual, or even the dual of its dual (though the latter situation happens quite often, and such Banach spaces are called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflexive_space">reflexive</a>).</p>
<p>With Fréchet spaces things are even a little bit worse, because the dual of a Fréchet space (which is not a Banach space) is not even a Fréchet space! Since I did not know that and could not find a reference, I asked about this on Mathoverflow <a href="http://mathoverflow.net/questions/63383/which-frechet-spaces-have-a-dual-that-is-a-frechet-space">here</a> and promptly got an answer. Mathoverflow is a really amazing platform for this kind of question! </p>
<p>So, if we naively define the cotangent space as in finite dimensions by taking the dual space of every tangent space, then the cotangent bundle won&#8217;t be a Fréchet manifold.</p>
<p>We will therefore have to be careful with the definition of differential forms for Fréchet manifolds and define it explicitly: </p>
<p>A <b>differential form</b> (a one form) <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;alpha" class="latex" /> is a smooth map</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha%3A+T+M+%5Cto+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;alpha: T M &#92;to &#92;mathbb{R} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T+M&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T M" class="latex" /> is the tangent bundle, such that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;alpha" class="latex" /> restricts to a linear map on every tangent space <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_p+M&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T_p M" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>Another pitfall is that theorems from multivariable calculus may fail in Fréchet spaces, like the existence and uniqueness <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picard-Lindel%C3%B6f">theorem of Picard-Lindelöf</a> for ordinary differential equations.  Things are much easier in Banach spaces: If you take a closer look at multivariable calculus, you will notice that a lot of definitions and theorems actually make use of the Banach space structure of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5En&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}^n" class="latex" /> only, so that a lot generalizes straight forward to infinite dimensional Banach spaces. But that is less so for Fréchet spaces.</p>
<p>By now you should feel reasonably comfortable with the notion of a Fréchet manifold, so let us talk about the kind of gadget that Arnold used to describe fluid flows: diffeomorphism groups that are both infinite-dimensional Riemannian manifolds and Lie groups.</p>
<h3>The geodesic equation for an invariant metric</h3>
<p>If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="M" class="latex" /> is both a Riemannian manifold and a Lie group, it is possible to define the concept of <b>left or right invariant metric</b>. A left or right invariant metric <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="d" class="latex" /> on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="M" class="latex" /> is one that does not change if we multiply the arguments with a group element:</p>
<p>A metric <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="d" class="latex" /> is left invariant iff for all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g%2C+h_1%2C+h_2+%5Cin+G&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="g, h_1, h_2 &#92;in G" class="latex" />:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d+%28h_1%2C+h_2%29+%3D+d%28g+h_1%2C+g+h_2%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="d (h_1, h_2) = d(g h_1, g h_2) " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Similarly, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="d" class="latex" /> is right invariant iff:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d%28h_1%2C+h_2%29+%3D+d%28h_1+g%2C+h_2+g%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="d(h_1, h_2) = d(h_1 g, h_2 g) " class="latex" /> </p>
<p>How does one get a one-sided invariant metric?</p>
<p>Here is one possibility: If you take a Lie group <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="M" class="latex" /> off the shelf, you get two automorphisms for free, namely the left and right multiplication by a group element <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="g" class="latex" />:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L_g%2C+R_g%3A+M+%5Cto+M+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="L_g, R_g: M &#92;to M " class="latex" /></p>
<p>given by:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L_g%28h%29+%3A%3D+g+h+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="L_g(h) := g h " class="latex" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R_g%28h%29+%3A%3D+h+g+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="R_g(h) := h g " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Pictorially speaking, you can use the differentials of these to transport vector s from the Lie algebra <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathfrak%7Bm%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathfrak{m}" class="latex" /> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="M" class="latex" /> &#8211; which is the tangent space at the identity of the group, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%5Cmathrm%7Bid%7DM&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T_&#92;mathrm{id}M" class="latex" /> &#8211; to any other tangent space <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_g+M&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T_g M" class="latex" />. If you can define an inner product on the Lie algebra, you can use this trick to transport the inner product to all the other tangent spaces by left or right multiplication, which will get you a left or right invariant metric.</p>
<p>To be more precise, for every tangent vectors <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=U%2C+V&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="U, V" class="latex" /> of a tangent space <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7Bg%7D+M&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T_{g} M" class="latex" /> there are unique vectors <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X%2C+Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X, Y" class="latex" /> that are mapped to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=U%2C+V&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="U, V" class="latex" /> by the differential of the right multiplication <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R_g&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="R_g" class="latex" />, that is</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d+R_g+X+%3D+U++%5Ctextrm%7B%5C%3B+and+%5C%3B%7D+d+R_g+Y+%3D+V+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="d R_g X = U  &#92;textrm{&#92;; and &#92;;} d R_g Y = V " class="latex" /> </p>
<p>and we can define the inner product of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=U&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="U" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="V" class="latex" /> to have the value of that of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Y" class="latex" />:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+U%2C+V+%5Crangle+%3A%3D+%5Clangle+X%2C+Y+%5Crangle+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;langle U, V &#92;rangle := &#92;langle X, Y &#92;rangle " class="latex" /></p>
<p>This works for the left multiplication <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L_g&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="L_g" class="latex" />, too, of course.</p>
<p>For a one-sided invariant metric, the geodesic equation looks somewhat simpler than for general metrics. Let us take a look at that:</p>
<p>On a Riemannian manifold <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="M" class="latex" /> with tangent bundle <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T+M&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T M" class="latex" /> there is a unique connection, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi-Civita_connection">Levi-Civita connection</a>, with the following properties for vector fields <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X%2C+Y%2C+Z+%5Cin+T+M&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X, Y, Z &#92;in T M" class="latex" />:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z+%5Clangle+X%2C+Y+%5Crangle+%3D+%5Clangle+%5Cnabla_Z+X%2C+Y+%5Crangle+%2B+%5Clangle+X%2C+%5Cnabla_Z+Y+%5Crangle+%5Ctextrm%7B%5C%3B+%28metric+compatibility%29%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Z &#92;langle X, Y &#92;rangle = &#92;langle &#92;nabla_Z X, Y &#92;rangle + &#92;langle X, &#92;nabla_Z Y &#92;rangle &#92;textrm{&#92;; (metric compatibility)} " class="latex" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla_X+Y+-+%5Cnabla_Y+X+%3D+%5BX%2C+Y%5D+%5Ctextrm%7B%5C%3B+%28torsion+freeness%29%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;nabla_X Y - &#92;nabla_Y X = [X, Y] &#92;textrm{&#92;; (torsion freeness)} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>If we combine both formulas we get</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2+%5Clangle+%5Cnabla_X+Y%2C+Z+%5Crangle+%3D+X+%5Clangle+Y%2C+Z+%5Crangle+%2B+Y+%5Clangle+Z%2C+X+%5Crangle+-+Z+%5Clangle+X%2C+Y+%5Crangle+%2B+%5Clangle+%5BX%2C+Y%5D%2C+Z+%5Crangle+-+%5Clangle+%5BY%2C+Z%5D%2C+X+%5Crangle+%2B+%5Clangle+%5BZ%2C+X%5D%2C+Y+%5Crangle+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="2 &#92;langle &#92;nabla_X Y, Z &#92;rangle = X &#92;langle Y, Z &#92;rangle + Y &#92;langle Z, X &#92;rangle - Z &#92;langle X, Y &#92;rangle + &#92;langle [X, Y], Z &#92;rangle - &#92;langle [Y, Z], X &#92;rangle + &#92;langle [Z, X], Y &#92;rangle " class="latex" /></p>
<p>If the inner products are constant along every flow, i.e. the metric is (left or right) invariant, then the first three terms on the right hand side vanish, so that we get</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2+%5Clangle+%5Cnabla_X+Y%2C+Z+%5Crangle+%3D+%5Clangle+%5BX%2C+Y%5D%2C+Z+%5Crangle+-+%5Clangle+%5BY%2C+Z%5D%2C+X+%5Crangle+%2B+%5Clangle+%5BZ%2C+X%5D%2C+Y+%5Crangle+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="2 &#92;langle &#92;nabla_X Y, Z &#92;rangle = &#92;langle [X, Y], Z &#92;rangle - &#92;langle [Y, Z], X &#92;rangle + &#92;langle [Z, X], Y &#92;rangle " class="latex" /></p>
<p>This latter formula can be written in a more succinct way if we introduce the <b>coadjoint operator</b>. Remeber the adjoint operator defined to be</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7Bad%7D_X+Z+%3D+%5BX%2C+Z%5D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{ad}_X Z = [X, Z] " class="latex" /></p>
<p>With the help of the inner product we can define the adjoint of the adjoint operator:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5Cmathrm%7Bad%7D%5E%2A_X+Y%2C+Z+%5Crangle+%3A%3D+%5Clangle+Y%2C+%5Cmathrm%7Bad%7D_X+Z+%5Crangle+%3D+%5Clangle+Y%2C+%5BX%2C+Z%5D+%5Crangle+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;langle &#92;mathrm{ad}^*_X Y, Z &#92;rangle := &#92;langle Y, &#92;mathrm{ad}_X Z &#92;rangle = &#92;langle Y, [X, Z] &#92;rangle " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Beware!  We&#8217;re using the word &#8216;adjoint&#8217; in two completely different ways here, both of which are very common in math.  <i>One</i> way is to use &#8216;adjoint&#8217; for the operation of taking a Lie bracket: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7Bad%7D_X+Z+%3D+%5BX%2CZ%5D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{ad}_X Z = [X,Z]" class="latex" />.  <i>Another</i> is to use &#8216;adjoint&#8217; for the linear map <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T%3A+W+%5Cto+V&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T: W &#92;to V" class="latex" /> coming from a linear map between inner product spaces <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T%3A+V+%5Cto+W&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T: V &#92;to W" class="latex" /> given by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+T%5E%2A+w%2C+v+%5Crangle+%3D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;langle T^* w, v &#92;rangle = " class="latex" /> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+w%2C+T+v+%5Crangle.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;langle w, T v &#92;rangle." class="latex" />  Please don&#8217;t blame me for this.</p>
<p>Then the formula above for the covariant derivative can be written as</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2+%5Clangle+%5Cnabla_X+Y%2C+Z+%5Crangle+%3D+%5Clangle+%5Cmathrm%7Bad%7D_X+Y%2C+Z+%5Crangle+-+%5Clangle+%5Cmathrm%7Bad%7D%5E%2A_Y+X%2C+Z+%5Crangle+-+%5Clangle+%5Cmathrm%7Bad%7D%5E%2A_X+Y%2C+Z+%5Crangle+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="2 &#92;langle &#92;nabla_X Y, Z &#92;rangle = &#92;langle &#92;mathrm{ad}_X Y, Z &#92;rangle - &#92;langle &#92;mathrm{ad}^*_Y X, Z &#92;rangle - &#92;langle &#92;mathrm{ad}^*_X Y, Z &#92;rangle " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Since the inner product is nondegenerate, we can eliminate <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Z" class="latex" /> and get</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2+%5Cnabla_X+Y+%3D+%5Cmathrm%7Bad%7D_X+Y+-+%5Cmathrm%7Bad%7D%5E%2A_X+Y+-+%5Cmathrm%7Bad%7D%5E%2A_Y+X+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="2 &#92;nabla_X Y = &#92;mathrm{ad}_X Y - &#92;mathrm{ad}^*_X Y - &#92;mathrm{ad}^*_Y X " class="latex" /></p>
<p>A geodesic curve is one whose tangent vector <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> is transported parallel to itself.   That is, we have</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla_X+X+%3D+0+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;nabla_X X = 0 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Using the formula for the covariant derivative for an invariant metric above we get</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla_X+X+%3D+-+%5Cmathrm%7Bad%7D%5E%2A_X+X+%3D+0+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;nabla_X X = - &#92;mathrm{ad}^*_X X = 0 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>as a reformulation of the geodesic equation.</p>
<p>For time dependent dynamical systems, we have the time axis as an additional dimension and every vector field has <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpartial_t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;partial_t" class="latex" /> as an additional summand. So, in this case we get as the geodesic equation (again, for an invariant metric):</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla_X+X+%3D+%5Cpartial_t+X+-+%5Cmathrm%7Bad%7D%5E%2A_X+X+%3D+0+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;nabla_X X = &#92;partial_t X - &#92;mathrm{ad}^*_X X = 0 " class="latex" /></p>
<h3>A simple example: the circle</h3>
<p>As a simple example we will look at the circle <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%5E1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S^1" class="latex" /> and its diffeomorphism group <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BDiff%7D+S%5E1.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{Diff} S^1." class="latex" /> The Lie algebra <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BVect%7D%28S%5E1%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{Vect}(S^1)" class="latex" /> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BDiff%7D+S%5E1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{Diff} S^1" class="latex" /> can be identified with the space of all vector  fields on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%5E1.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S^1." class="latex" /> If we sloppily identify <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%5E1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S^1" class="latex" /> with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%2F%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}/&#92;mathbb{Z}" class="latex" /> with coordinate <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" />, then we can write for vector  fields <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X+%3D+u%28x%29+%5Cpartial_x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X = u(x) &#92;partial_x" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y+%3D+v%28x%29+%5Cpartial_x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Y = v(x) &#92;partial_x" class="latex" /> the commutator </p>

<p>And of course we have an inner product via</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+X%2C+Y+%5Crangle+%3D+%5Cint_%7BS%5E1%7D+u%28x%29+v%28x%29+d+x+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;langle X, Y &#92;rangle = &#92;int_{S^1} u(x) v(x) d x " class="latex" /></p>
<p>which we can use to define either a left or a right invariant metric on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BDiff%7D+S%5E1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{Diff} S^1" class="latex" />, by transporting it via left or right multiplication to every tangent space.</p>
<p>Let us evaluate the geodesic equation for this example. We have to calculate the effect of the coadjoint operator:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5Cmathrm%7Bad%7D%5E%2A_X+Y%2C+Z+%5Crangle+%3A%3D+%5Clangle+Y%2C+%5Cmathrm%7Bad%7D_X+Z+%5Crangle+%3D+%5Clangle+Y%2C+%5BX%2C+Z%5D+%5Crangle+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;langle &#92;mathrm{ad}^*_X Y, Z &#92;rangle := &#92;langle Y, &#92;mathrm{ad}_X Z &#92;rangle = &#92;langle Y, [X, Z] &#92;rangle " class="latex" /></p>
<p>If we write for the vector  fields <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X+%3D+u%28x%29+%5Cpartial_x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X = u(x) &#92;partial_x" class="latex" />, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y+%3D+v%28x%29+%5Cpartial_x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Y = v(x) &#92;partial_x" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z+%3D+w%28x%29+%5Cpartial_x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Z = w(x) &#92;partial_x" class="latex" />, this results in</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5Cmathrm%7Bad%7D%5E%2A_X+Y%2C+Z+%5Crangle+%3D+%5Cint_%7BS%5E1%7D+v+%28u+w_x+-+u_x+w%29+d+x+%3D+-+%5Cint_%7BS%5E1%7D+%28u+v_x+%2B+2+u_x+v%29+w+d+x+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;langle &#92;mathrm{ad}^*_X Y, Z &#92;rangle = &#92;int_{S^1} v (u w_x - u_x w) d x = - &#92;int_{S^1} (u v_x + 2 u_x v) w d x " class="latex" /></p>
<p>where the last step employs integration by parts and uses the periodic boundary condition <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x+%2B+1%29+%3D+f%28x%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f(x + 1) = f(x)" class="latex" /> for the involved functions.</p>
<p>So we get for the coadjoint operator</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7Bad%7D%5E%2A_X+Y+%3D+-+%28u+v_x+%2B+2+u_x+v%29+%5Cpartial_x+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{ad}^*_X Y = - (u v_x + 2 u_x v) &#92;partial_x " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Finally, the geodesic equation </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpartial_t+X+%2B+%5Cnabla_X+X+%3D+0+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;partial_t X + &#92;nabla_X X = 0 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>turns out to be</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u_t+%2B+3+u+u_x+%3D+0+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="u_t + 3 u u_x = 0 " class="latex" /> </p>
<p>A similar equation,</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u_t+%2B+u+u_x+%3D+0+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="u_t + u u_x = 0 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>is known as the Hopf equation or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgers%27_equation">inviscid Burgers&#8217; equation</a>. It looks simple, but its solutions can produce behaviour that looks like turbulence, so it is interesting in its own right. </p>
<p>If we take a somewhat more sophisticated diffeomorphism group, we can get slightly more complicated and therefore more interesting partial differential equations like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korteweg%E2%80%93de_Vries_equation">Korteweg-de Vries equation</a>. But since this post is quite long already, that topic will have to wait for another post!</p>

				<small>13 February, 2012</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>Lately the distribution of hits per hour on this blog has become very <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat-tailed_distribution">fat-tailed</a>.  In other words: the readership shoots up immensely now and then.  I just noticed today&#8217;s statistics:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/azimuth-statistics_2-12-2012.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p>That spike on the right is what I&#8217;m talking about: 338 hits per hour, while before it was hovering in the low 80&#8217;s, as usual for the weekend.  Why?   Someone on <i>Hacker News</i> posted an item saying: </p>
<blockquote><p>
John Baez will give his Google Talk tomorrow in the form of a robot.
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/01/24/i-robot/">That&#8217;s true!</a>   If you&#8217;re near Silicon Valley on Monday the 13th and you want to see me in the form of a robot, come to the Google campus and listen to my talk <i>Energy, the Environment and What We Can Do</i>.  </p>
<p>It starts at 4 pm in the Paramaribo Room (Building 42, Floor 2).  You&#8217;ll need to check in 15 minutes before that at the main visitor’s lounge in Building 43, and someone will escort you to the talk. </p>
<p>But if you can&#8217;t attend, don&#8217;t worry!  A video will appear on YouTube, and I&#8217;ll point you to it when it does.</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/01/24/i-robot/"><img height="200" src="https://i0.wp.com/media.npr.org/assets/img/2011/12/31/anybot_custom.jpg" /></a>
</div>
<p>I tested out the robot a few days ago from a hotel room in Australia&#8212;it&#8217;s a strange sensation!  Suzanne Brocato showed me the ropes.  To talk to me easily, she lowered my &#8216;head&#8217; until I was just 4 feet tall.  &#8220;You&#8217;re so short!&#8221; she laughed.  I rolled around the offices of Anybot and met the receptionist, who was also in the form of a robot.  Then we went to the office of the CEO, Trevor Blackwell, and planned out my talk a little.  I need to practice more today.  </p>
<p>But why did someone at <i>Hacker News</i> post that comment just then?  I suspect it&#8217;s because I reminded people about my talk on Google+ last night.  </p>
<p>The fat-tailed distribution of blog hits is also happening at the scale of days, not just hours:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/azimuth-statistics_1-2012.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p>The spikes happen when I talk about a &#8216;hot topic&#8217;.  January 27th was my biggest day so far.   <i>Slashdot</i> discovered my post about the <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/01/26/ban-elsevier/">Elsevier boycott</a>, and send 3468 readers my way.   But a total 6499 people viewed that post, so a bunch must have come from other sources.</p>
<p>January 31st was also big: 3271 people came to read about <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/01/31/the-faculty-of-1000/">The Faculty of 1000</a>.  2140 of them were sent over by <i>Hacker News</i>.</p>
<p>If I were trying to make money from advertising on this blog, I&#8217;d be pushed toward more posts about hot topics.  Forget the mind-bending articles on <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/02/10/quantropy-part-2/">quantropy</a>, packed with complicated equations!  </p>
<p>But as it is, I&#8217;m trying to do some mixture of having fun, figuring out stuff, and getting people to save the planet.  (Open access publishing fits into that mandate: it&#8217;s tragic how climate crackpots post on popular blogs while experts on climate change publish their papers in journals hidden from public view!)  So, I don&#8217;t want to maximize readership: what matters more is getting people to do good stuff.  </p>
<p>Do you have any suggestions on how I could do this better, while still being me?  I&#8217;m not going to get a personality transplant, so there are limits on what I&#8217;ll do.</p>
<p>One good idea would be to make sure every post on a &#8216;hot topic&#8217; offers readers <i>something they can do now</i>.  </p>
<p>Hmm, readership is still spiking:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/azimuth-statistics_2-12a-2012.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p>But enough of this navel-gazing!  Here are some recent Azimuth articles about energy on Google+.  </p>
<h3> Energy </h3>
<p>1) In his State of the Union speech, Obama <a href="http://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/politics/blogs/sotu-2012-obama-touts-old-new-energy">talked a lot about energy</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
We&#8217;ve subsidized oil companies for a century. That&#8217;s long enough.  It&#8217;s time to end the taxpayer giveaways to an industry that rarely has been more profitable, and double-down on a clean energy industry that never has been more promising.
</p></blockquote>
<p>He acknowledged that differences on Capitol Hill are &#8220;too deep right now&#8221; to pass a comprehensive climate bill, but he added that &#8220;there&#8217;s no reason why Congress shouldn&#8217;t at least set a clean-energy standard that creates a market for innovation.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, lest anyone think he actually wants to stop global warming, he also pledged &#8220;to open more than 75 percent of our potential offshore oil and gas resources.&#8221; </p>
<p>2) This paper claims a &#8216;phase change&#8217; hit the oil markets around 2005:</p>
<p>&bull; James Murray and David King, <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v481/n7382/full/481433a.html">Climate policy: Oil&#8217;s tipping point has passed</a>, <i>Nature</i> <b>481</b> (2011), 433–435. </p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/murray_king_oil_market_phase_change.jpg"><br />
<img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/murray_king_oil_market_phase_change.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>They write:</p>
<blockquote><p>
In 2005, global production of regular crude oil reached about 72 million barrels per day. From then on, production capacity seems to have hit a ceiling at 75 million barrels per day. A plot of prices against production from 1998 to today shows this dramatic transition, from a time when supply could respond elastically to rising prices caused by increased demand, to when it could not (see &#8216;Phase shift&#8217;). As a result, prices swing wildly in response to small changes in demand. Other people have remarked on this step change in the economics of oil around the year 2005, but the point needs to be lodged more firmly in the minds of policy-makers.
</p></blockquote>
<p>3) Help out the famous climate blogger Joe Romm!  He asks: <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/romm/2012/02/11/423484/us-energy-mix-in-2050-cut-co2-emissions-80/?mobile=nc">What will the U.S. energy mix look like in 2050 if we cut CO<sub>2</sub> emissions 80%?</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
How much total energy is consumed in 2050&#8230; How much coal, oil, and natural gas is being consumed (with carbon capture and storage of some coal and gas if you want to consider that)? What’s the price of oil? How much of our power is provided by nuclear power? How much by solar PV and how much by concentrated solar thermal? How much from wind power? How much from biomass? How much from other forms of renewable energy?  What is the vehicle fleet like? How much electric? How much next-generation biofuels?
</p></blockquote>
<p>As he notes, there are lots of studies on these issues.  Point him to the best ones!</p>
<p>4) Due to plunging prices for components, solar power prices in Germany <a href="http://www.trust.org/alertnet/news/falling-solar-prices-good-for-climate-bad-for-firms/">dropped by half in the last 5 years</a>.  Now solar generates electricity at levels only slightly above what consumers pay. The subsidies will disappear entirely within a few years, when solar will be as cheap as conventional fossil fuels.  Germany has added 14,000 megawatts capacity in the last 2 years and now has 24,000 megawatts in total&#8212;enough green electricity to meet nearly 4% the country&#8217;s power demand. That is expected to rise to 10% by 2020. Germany now has almost 10 times more installed capacity than the United States.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all great&#8212;but, umm, what about the other 90%?   What&#8217;s their long-term plan?  Will they keep using coal-fired power plants?   Will they buy more nuclear power from France?</p>
<p>In May 2011, Britain claimed it would <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/may/17/uk-halve-carbon-emissions">halve carbon emissions by 2025</a>.  Is Germany making equally bold claims or not?   Of course what matters is deeds, not words, but I&#8217;m curious.</p>
<p>5) Stephen Lacey presents <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/romm/2012/01/23/408258/an-illustrated-guide-to-the-state-of-sustainability/">some interesting charts</a> showing the progress and problems with sustainability in the US.  For example, there&#8217;s been a striking drop in how much energy is being used per dollar of GNP:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://thinkprogress.org/romm/2012/01/23/408258/an-illustrated-guide-to-the-state-of-sustainability/"><br />
<img width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screen-shot-2012-01-20-at-3.06.56-PM.png" /></a></div>
<p>Sorry for the archaic &#8216;British Thermal Units&#8217;: we no longer have a king, but for some reason the U.S. failed to throw off the old British system of measurement.  A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_thermal_unit">BTU</a> is a bit more than a kilojoule.</p>
<p>Despite these dramatic changes, Lacey says &#8220;we waste around 85% of the energy produced in the U.S.&#8221;  But he doesn&#8217;t say how that number was arrived at.  Does anyone know?</p>
<p>6) The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) has a new report called <i><a href="http://aceee.org/research-report/e121">The Long-Term Energy Efficiency Potential: What the Evidence Suggests</a></i>.  It describes some scenarios, including one where the US encourages a greater level of productive investments in energy efficiency so that by the year 2050, it reduces overall energy consumption by 40 to 60 percent.  I&#8217;m very interested in how much efficiency can help.   Some, but not all, of the improvements will be eaten up by the <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Rebound+effect">rebound effect</a>.   </p>

				<small>27 January, 2012</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKinsey_%26_Company">McKinsey &amp; Company</a> is a management consulting firm.  In 2010 they released this &#8216;carbon abatement cost curve&#8217; for the whole world:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mckinsey_carbon_abatement_cost_curve_world.jpg"><img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mckinsey_carbon_abatement_cost_curve_world.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>Click it to see a nice big version.  So, they&#8217;re claiming:</p>
<p>&bull; <b>By 2030 we can cut CO<sub>2</sub> emissions about 15 gigatonnes per year while saving lots of money</b>. </p>
<p>&bull; <b>By 2030 can cut CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by up to 37 gigatonnes per year before the total cost&#8212;that is, cost minus savings&#8212;becomes positive</b>.</p>
<p>The graph is cute.  The vertical axis of the graph says how many euros per tonne it would cost to cut CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 2030 using various measures.  The horizontal axis says how many gigatonnes per year we could reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions using these measures. </p>
<p>So, we get lots of blue rectangles.  If a rectangle is below the horizontal axis, its area says how many euros per year we&#8217;d <i>save</i> by implementing that measure.  If it&#8217;s above the axis, its area says how much that measure would <i>cost</i>.</p>
<p>I believe the total blue area below the axis equals the total blue area above the axis.  So if we do all these things, the total cost is zero.</p>
<p>37 gigatonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> is roughly 10 gigatonnes of carbon: remember, there&#8217;s a crucial factor of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3%5Cfrac%7B2%7D%7B3%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="3&#92;frac{2}{3}" class="latex" /> here.  In 2004, <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Stabilization+wedges">Pacala and Socolow</a> argued that the world needs to find ways to cut carbon emissions by about 7 gigatonnes/year by 2054 to keep emissions flat until this time.  By now we&#8217;d need 9 gigatonnes/year.</p>
<p>If so, <i><b>it seems the measures shown here could keep carbon emissions flat worldwide at no net cost!</b></i></p>
<p>But as usual, there are at least a few problems.  </p>
<h3> Problem 1 </h3>
<p>Is McKinsey&#8217;s analysis correct?  I don&#8217;t know.  Here&#8217;s their report, along with some others:</p>
<p>&bull; McKinsey &amp; Company, <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/Client_Service/Sustainability/Latest_thinking/Costcurves">Impact of the financial crisis on carbon economics: Version 2.1 of the global greenhouse gas abatement cost curve</a>, 2010.</p>
<p>For more details it&#8217;s good to read version 2.0:</p>
<p>&bull; McKinsey &amp; Company, <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/Client_Service/Sustainability/Latest_thinking/Pathways_to_a_low_carbon_economy">Pathways to a low carbon economy: Version 2 of the global greenhouse gas abatement cost curve</a>, 2009.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re free if you fill out some forms.  But it&#8217;s not easy to check these things.  Does anyone know papers that try to check McKinsey&#8217;s work?   I find it&#8217;s more fun to study a problem like this after you see two sides of the same story.</p>
<h3> Problem 2 </h3>
<p>I said &#8216;no net cost&#8217;.  But if you need to spend a lot of money, the fact that I&#8217;m saving a lot doesn&#8217;t compensate you.  So there&#8217;s the nontrivial problem of taking money that&#8217;s saved on some measures and making sure it gets spent on others.  Here&#8217;s where &#8216;big government&#8217; might be required&#8212;which makes some people decide global warming is just a political conspiracy, nyeh-heh-heh.</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/dastardly_whiplash.jpg" /></div>
<p>Is there another way to make the money transfer happen, without top-down authority?  </p>
<p>We could still get the job about half-done at a huge savings, of course.  McKinsey says we could cut CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 15 gigatonnes per year doing things that only save money.  That&#8217;s about 4 gigatonnes of carbon per year!  We could at least do that.</p>
<h3> Problem 3 </h3>
<p>Keeping carbon emissions flat is not enough.  Carbon dioxide, once put in the atmosphere, stays there a long time&#8212;though individual molecules come and go.  As the saying goes, <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Carbon+is+forever">carbon is forever</a>.  (Click that link for more precise information.)</p>
<p>So, even Pacala and Socolow say keeping carbon emissions flat is a mere stopgap before we actually <i>reduce</i> carbon emissions, starting in 2054.  But some more recent papers seem to suggest Pacala and Socolow were being overly optimistic.  </p>
<p>Of course it depends on how much global warming you&#8217;re willing to tolerate!  It also depends on lots of other things.  </p>
<p>Anyway, this paper claims that if we cut global greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2050 (as compared to what they were in 1990), there&#8217;s a 12–45% probability that the world will get at least 2 °C warmer than its temperature before the industrial revolution:</p>
<p>&bull; Malte Meinshausen <i>et al</i>, <a href="https://www1.ethz.ch/iac/people/knuttir/papers/meinshausen09nat.pdf">Greenhouse-gas emission targets for limiting global warming to 2 °C</a>, <i>Nature</i> <b>458</b> (2009), 1158&#8211;1163. </p>
<blockquote><p>
<b>Abstract:</b> More than 100 countries have adopted a global warming limit of 2 °C or below (relative to pre-industrial levels) as a guiding principle for mitigation efforts to reduce climate change risks, impacts and damages. However, the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions corresponding to a specified maximum warming are poorly known owing to uncertainties in the carbon cycle and the climate response. Here we provide a comprehensive probabilistic analysis aimed at quantifying GHG emission budgets for the 2000–50 period that would limit warming throughout the twenty-first century to below 2 °C, based on a combination of published distributions of climate system properties and observational constraints. We show that, for the chosen class of emission scenarios, both cumulative emissions up to 2050 and emission levels in 2050 are robust indicators of the probability that twenty-first century warming will not exceed 2 °C relative to pre-industrial temperatures.</p>
<p>Limiting cumulative CO<sub>2</sub> emissions over 2000–50 to 1,000 Gt CO<sub>2</sub> yields a 25% probability of warming exceeding 2 °C&#8212;and a limit of 1,440 Gt CO2 yields a 50% probability&#8212;given a representative estimate of the distribution of climate system properties. As known 2000–06 CO<sub>2</sub> emissions were 234 Gt CO<sub>2</sub>, less than half the proven economically recoverable oil, gas and coal reserves can still be emitted up to 2050 to achieve such a goal. Recent G8 Communiques envisage halved global GHG emissions by 2050, for which we estimate a 12–45% probability of exceeding 2 °C—assuming 1990 as emission base year and a range of published climate sensitivity distributions. Emissions levels in 2020 are a less robust indicator, but for the scenarios considered, the probability of exceeding 2 °C rises to 53–87% if global GHG emissions are still more than 25% above 2000 levels in 2020.

<p>This paper says we&#8217;re basically doomed to suffer unless we revamp society:</p>
<p>&bull; Ted Trainer, Can renewables etc. solve the greenhouse problem? The negative case, <i><a href="http://www.dieoff.com/_Energy/TrainerRenewables.pdf">Energy Policy</a></i> <b>38</b> (2010), 4107–4114.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<b>Abstract:</b> Virtually all current discussion of climate change and energy problems proceeds on the assumption that technical solutions are possible within basically affluent-consumer societies. There is however a substantial case that this assumption is mistaken. This case derives from a consideration of the scale of the tasks and of the limits of non-carbon energy sources, focusing especially on the need for redundant capacity in winter. The first line of argument is to do with the extremely high capital cost of the supply system that would be required, and the second is to do with the problems set by the intermittency of renewable sources. It is concluded that the general climate change and energy problem cannot be solved without large scale reductions in rates of economic production and consumption, and therefore without transition to fundamentally different social structures and systems.

<p>It&#8217;s worth reading because it uses actual numbers, not just hand-waving.  But it seeks much more than keeping carbon emissions <i>flat</i> until 2050; that&#8217;s one reason for the dire conclusions.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting this rebuttal, which says that everything about Trainer&#8217;s paper is fine except a premature dismissal of nuclear power:</p>
<p>&bull; Barry Brook, Could nuclear fission energy, etc., solve the greenhouse problem? The affirmative case, <i><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421511009189">Energy Policy</a></i>, available online 16 December 2011.</p>
<p>To get your hands on Brook&#8217;s paper you either need a subscription or you need to email him. You can do that starting from his blog article about the paper&#8230; which is definitely worth reading:</p>
<p>&bull; Barry Brook, <a href="http://bravenewclimate.com/2012/01/14/nuclear-solve-greenhouse/">Could nuclear fission energy, etc., solve the greenhouse problem? The affirmative case,</a> BraveNewClimate, 14 January 2012.</p>
<p>According to Brook, we can keep global warming from getting too bad <i>if</i> we get really serious about nuclear power. </p>
<p>Of course, these three papers are just a few of many.  I&#8217;m still trying to sift through the information and figure out what&#8217;s really going on.  It&#8217;s hard.   It may be impossible.  But McKinsey&#8217;s list of <i>ways to cut carbon emissions and save money</i> points to some things we start doing right now.</p>
