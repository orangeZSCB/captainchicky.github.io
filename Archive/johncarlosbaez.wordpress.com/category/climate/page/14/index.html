					<p>While struggling to prepare my talk on &#8220;what mathematicians can do&#8221;, I remembered this website pointed out by Tom Leinster:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.mpe2013.org/">Mathematics of Planet Earth 2013</a>.</p>
<p>The idea is to get lots of mathematicians involved in programs on these topics:</p>
<p>&bull; Weather, climate, and environment<br />
&bull; Health, human and social services<br />
&bull;  Planetary resources<br />
&bull;  Population dynamics, ecology and genomics of species<br />
&bull; Energy utilization and efficiency<br />
&bull; Connecting the planet together<br />
&bull; Geophysical processes<br />
&bull;  Global economics, safety and stability </p>
<p>There are already a lot of <a href="http://www.mpe2013.org/partnerssocieties.php">partner societies</a> (including the American Mathematical Society) and <a href="http://www.mpe2013.org/partnersinstitutes.php">partner institutes</a>.  I would love to see more details, but this website seems directed mainly at getting more organizations involved, rather than saying what any of them are going to do.   </p>
<p>There is a <a href="http://www.mpe2013.org/mise_a_jour_participation_angl.pdf">call for proposals</a>, but it&#8217;s a bit sketchy.  It says:</p>
<div align="center">
<b>A call to join is sent to the planet.</b>
</div>
<p>which makes me want to ask <i>&#8220;From where?&#8221;</i>  </p>
<p>(That must be why I&#8217;m sitting here blogging instead of heading an institute somewhere.  I never fully grew up.)</p>
<p>I guess the details will eventually become clearer.  Does anyone know some activities that have been planned?</p>

				<small>3 March, 2011</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>Here&#8217;s a great opportunity if you&#8217;re a student looking for something to do this summer.  The <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Climate+Code+Foundation">Climate Code Foundation</a> is working on open-source versions of important climate software.  If you&#8217;re lucky, you could get paid to help! </p>
<p>&bull; Climate Code Foundation, <a href="http://climatecode.org/blog/2011/02/google-summer-of-code/">Google Summer of Code</a>.</p>
<p>It seems the window for student applications is <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2011/timeline">March 28-April 8</a>.  </p>
<p>They write:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Google have announced <a href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2011/01/google-summer-of-code-announced-at-lca.html">their Summer of Code</a>, and we intend to be a mentoring organisation.  If you&#8217;re a student, this is an opportunity to work on our open source code and earn a bit of money doing so (Google give a stipend of USD 5000 qualifying students, and an honorarium of USD 500 to the mentoring organisation).</p>
<p>We have an <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ccc-gistemp/wiki/GSoC2011">ideas page</a>, most of which revolves around our <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ccc-gistemp/">ccc-gistemp</a> project.  Ideas range from improving ccc-gistemp in various ways, through novel reconstructions, to clear implementations of other climate codes.  If you have ideas of your own, we&#8217;d like to hear about those too.</p>
<p>If you are interested in participating as a student, then <a href="http://climatecode.org/contact/">please get in touch</a>.</p>
<p>We have not been a Summer of Code mentor before, but we bring many years (decades even!) of experience to the table: experience in computer science, software engineering, project management, and so on.  We hope to help students make a success of their projects!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In case you&#8217;re wondering, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ccc-gistemp/">ccc-gistemp</a> is a version of GISTEMP written in Python.  </p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it annoying how explaining one mysterious word can require two more?   In case you&#8217;re <i>still</i> wondering: <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> is a really groovy modern programming language, in comparison to older ones like FORTRAN&mdash;and <a href="http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/">GISTEMP</a> is an important computer program, mostly written in FORTRAN, which NASA uses to analyze the historical temperature record. GISTEMP is what gives us graphs like this:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs/"><br />
<img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs/Fig.A2.gif" /><br />
</a>
</div>
<p>So, it&#8217;s very important to update this program and search the existing program for bugs&mdash;and that&#8217;s what the Climate Code Foundation is doing:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The “all Python” milestone was achieved with ccc-gistemp release 0.2.0 on 2010-01-11. Naturally we have found (minor) bugs while doing this, but nothing else. Since 0.2.0 we have made major simplifications, chiefly by removing dependencies, and generally processing data internally (by avoiding writing it to intermediate files, which was only necessary on computers that would be considered extremely memory constrained by today’s standards).</p>
<p>Work continue on further simplification, clarification, generalisation, and extension.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Hone your programming skills while helping save the planet!</p>

				<small>28 February, 2011</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>I first encountered <a href="http://www.gregorybenford.com/">Gregory Benford</a> through his science fiction novels: my favorite is probably <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Ocean_of_Night"><i>In the Ocean of Night</i></a>.  </p>
<p>Later I learned that he&#8217;s an astrophysicist at U.C. Irvine, not too far from Riverside where I teach.  But I only actually met him through my wife.  She sometimes teaches courses on science fiction, and like Benford, she has some involvement with the <a href="http://eaton-collection.ucr.edu/">Eaton Collection</a> at U.C. Riverside&mdash;the largest publicly accessible SF library in the world.  So, I was bound to eventually bump into him.</p>
<p><div align="center">
<img border="2" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/gregory_benford.jpg" />
</div>
</p>
<p>
When I did, I learned about his work on electromagnetic filaments near the center of our galaxy&mdash;see <a href="week252.html">&#8220;week252&#8221;</a> for more. I also learned he was seriously interested in climate change, and that he was going to the <a href="http://www.climateresponsefund.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=137&amp;Itemid=81%22">Asilomar International Conference on Climate Intervention Technologies</a>&mdash;a controversial get-together designed to hammer out some policies for research on <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Geoengineering">geoengineering</a>.   </p>
<p>
Benford is a friendly but no-nonsense guy.  Recently he sent me an email mentioning my blog, and said: &quot;Your discussions on what to do are good, though general, while what we need is specifics NOW.&quot;  Since I&#8217;d been meaning to interview him for a while, this gave me the perfect opening.</p>
<p>
<b>JB</b>: You&#8217;ve been thinking about the future for a long time, since that&#8217;s part of your job as a science fiction writer.  For example, you&#8217;ve written a whole series about the expansion of human life through the galaxy.  From this grand perspective, global warming might seem like an annoying little road-bump before the ride even gets started.  How did you get interested in global warming?  </p>
<p>
<b>GB</b>: I liked writing about the far horizons of our human prospect; it’s fun. But to get even above the envelope of our atmosphere in a sustained way, we have to stabilize the planet. Before we take on the galaxy, let’s do a smaller problem .</p>
<p>
<b>JB</b>: Good point.  We can&#8217;t all ship on out of here, and the way it&#8217;s going now, maybe <i>none</i> of us will, unless we get our act together.</p>
<p>
Can you remember something that made you think &quot;Wow, global warming is a really serious problem&quot;?  As you know, not everyone is convinced yet.</p>
<p>
<b>GB</b>: I looked at the migration of animals and then the steadily northward march of trees. They don&#8217;t read newspapers&mdash;the trees <i>become</i> newspapers&mdash;so their opinion matters more. Plus the retreat of the Arctic Sea ice in summer, the region of the world most endangered by the changes coming. I first focused on carbon capture using the CROPS method.  I&#8217;m the guy who first proposed screening the Arctic with aerosols to cool it in summer.</p>
<p>
<b>JB</b>: Let&#8217;s talk about each in turn.  &quot;CROPS&quot; stands for Crop Residue Oceanic Permanent Sequestration.  The idea sounds pretty simple: dump a lot of crop residues&mdash;stalks, leaves and stuff&mdash;on the deep ocean floor.  That way, we&#8217;d be letting plants suck CO<sub>2</sub> out of the atmosphere for us.  </p>
<p>
<b>GB</b>: Agriculture is the world&#8217;s biggest industry; we should take advantage of it.  That&#8217;s what gave Bob Metzger and me the idea: collect farm waste and sink it to the bottom of the ocean, whence it shall not return for 1000 years. Cheap, easy, doable right now.  </p>
<p>
<b>JB</b>: But we have to think about what&#8217;ll happen if we dump all that stuff into the ocean, right?  After all, the USA alone creates half a gigatonne of crop residues each year, and world-wide it&#8217;s ten times that.  I&#8217;m getting these numbers from your papers:</p>
<p>
&bull; Robert A. Metzger and Gregory Benford, <a href="http://www.agci.org/dB/PDFs/03S2_CDifiglio_CropResidue.pdf">Sequestering of atmospheric carbon through permanent disposal of crop residue</a>, <i>Climatic Change</i> <b>49</b> (2001), 11-19.</p>
<p>
&bull; Stuart E. Strand and Gregory Benford, <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/es8015556">Ocean sequestration of crop residue carbon: recycling fossil fuel carbon back to deep sediments</a>, <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es8015556"><i>Environmental Science and Technology</i></a> <b>43</b> (2009), 1000-1007.</p>
<p>
Since we&#8217;re burning over 7 gigatonnes of carbon each year, burying 5 gigatonnes of crop waste is just enough to make a serious dent in our carbon footprint.  But what&#8217;ll that much junk do at the bottom of the ocean?</p>
<p>
<b>GB</b>:  We&#8217;re testing the chemistry of how farm waste interacts with deep ocean sites offshore Monterey Bay right now.  Here&#8217;s a picture of a bale 3.2 km down:</p>
<p><div align="center">
<img border="2" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/CROPS_field_test.jpg" alt="" />
</div>
</p>
<p>
<b>JB</b>: I&#8217;m sure our audience will have more questions about this&#8230; but the answers to some are in your papers, and I want to spend a bit more time on your proposal to screen the Arctic.  There&#8217;s a good summary here:</p>
<p>
&bull; Gregory Benford, <a href="http://reason.com/archives/1997/11/01/climate-controls">Climate controls</a>, <i>Reason Magazine</i>, November 1997.</p>
<p>
But in brief, it sounds like you want to test the results of spraying a lot of micron-sized dust into the atmosphere above the Arctic Sea during the summer.   You suggest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatomaceous_earth">diatomaceous earth</a> as an option, because it&#8217;s chemically inert: just silica.  How would the test work, exactly, and what would you hope to learn?</p>
<p>
<b>GB</b>:  The US has inflight refueling aircraft such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_KC-10_Extender">KC-10 Extender</a> that with minor changes spread aerosols at relevant altitudes, and pilots who know how to fly big sausages filled with fluids. </p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_KC-10_Extender"><br />
<img width="450" border="2" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/KC-10_Extender_%282151957820%29.jpg/800px-KC-10_Extender_%282151957820%29.jpg" alt="" /><br />
</a>
</div>
</p>
<p>
Rather than diatomaceous earth, I now think ordinary SO<sub>2</sub> or H<sub>2</sub>S will work, if there’s enough water at the relevant altitudes. Turns out the pollutant issue is minor, since it would be only a percent or so of the SO<sub>2</sub> already in the Arctic troposphere. The point is to spread aerosols to diminish sunlight and look for signals of less sunlight on the ground, changes in sea ice loss rates in summer, etc. It’s hard to do a weak experiment and be sure you see a signal.  Doing regional experiments helps, so you can see a signal before the aerosols spread much. It’s a first step, an in-principle experiment.</p>
<p>
Simulations show it can stop the sea ice retreat.  Many fear if we lose the sea ice in summer ocean currents may alter; nobody really knows.  We do know that the tundra is softening as it thaws, making roads impassible and shifting many wildlife patterns, with unforeseen long term effects.  Cooling the Arctic back to, say, the 1950 summer temperature range would cost maybe $300 million/year, i.e., nothing. Simulations show to do this globally, offsetting say CO<sub>2</sub> at 500 ppm, might cost a few billion dollars per year. That doesn’t help ocean acidification, but it&#8217;s a start on the temperature problem. </p>
<p>
<b>JB</b>: There&#8217;s an interesting blog on Arctic political, military and business developments:</p>
<p>
&bull; Anatoly Karlin, <a href="http://www.arcticprogress.com/2010/09/intro-why-arctic-progress/">Arctic Progress</a>.</p>
<p>
Here&#8217;s the overview:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Today, global warming is kick-starting Arctic history. The accelerating melting of Arctic sea ice promises to open up circumpolar shipping routes, halving the time needed for container ships and tankers to travel between Europe and East Asia. As the ice and permafrost retreat, the physical infrastructure of industrial civilization will overspread the region [&#8230;]. The four major populated regions encircling the Arctic Ocean&mdash;Alaska, Russia, Canada, Scandinavia (ARCS)&mdash;are all set for massive economic expansion in the decades ahead. But the flowering of industrial civilization&#8217;s fruit in the thawing Far North carries within it the seeds of its perils. The opening of the Arctic is making border disputes more serious and spurring Russian and Canadian military buildups in the region. The warming of the Arctic could also accelerate global warming&mdash;and not just through the increased economic activity and hydrocarbons production. One disturbing possibility is that the melting of the Siberian permafrost will release vast amounts of methane, a greenhouse gas that is far more potent than CO<sub>2</sub>, into the atmosphere, and tip the world into runaway climate change.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
But anyway, unlike many people, I&#8217;m not mentioning risks associated with geoengineering in order to instantly <a href="http://www.etcgroup.org/en/node/5080">foreclose discussion of it</a>, because I know there are also risks associated with not doing it.   If we rule out doing anything really new because it&#8217;s too expensive or too risky, we might wind up locking ourselves in a &quot;business as usual&quot; scenario.  And that could be even more risky&mdash;and perhaps ultimately more expensive as well. </p>
<p>
<b>GB</b>: Yes, no end of problems. Most impressive is how they look like a descending spiral, self-reinforcing. </p>
<p>
Certainly countries now scramble for Arctic resources, trade routes opened by thawing&mdash;all likely to become hotly contested strategic assets. So too melting Himalayan glaciers can perhaps trigger &quot;water wars&quot; in Asia&mdash;especially India and China, two vast lands of very different cultures. Then, coming on later, come rising sea levels. Florida starts to go away. The list is endless and therefore uninteresting. We all saturate.</p>
<p>
So droughts, floods, desertification, hammering weather events&mdash;they draw ever less attention as they grow more common. Maybe Darfur is the first &quot;climate war.&quot; It&#8217;s plausible.</p>
<p>
The Arctic is the canary in the climate coalmine. Cutting CO<sub>2</sub> emissions will take far too long to significantly affect the sea ice. Permafrost melts there, giving  additional positive feedback. Methane release from the not-so-perma-frost is the most dangerous amplifying feedback in the entire carbon cycle. As <a href="http://climateprogress.org/2009/08/17/positive-methane-feedbacks-permafrost-tundra-methane-hydrates/">John Nissen has repeatedly called attention to</a>, the permafrost permamelt holds a staggering 1.5 trillion tons of frozen carbon, about twice as much carbon as is in the atmosphere. Much would emerge as methane. Methane is 25 times as potent a heat-trapping gas as CO<sub>2</sub> over a century, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming_potential#Values">72 times as potent over the first 20 years</a>!  The carbon is locked in a freezer. Yet that&#8217;s the part of the planet warming up the fastest. Really bad news:</p>
<p>
&bull; Kevin Schaefer, Tingjun Zhang, Lori Bruhwiler and Andrew P. Barrett, Amount and timing of permafrost carbon release in response to climate warming, <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0889.2011.00527.x/abstract"><i>Tellus</i></a>, 15 February 2011.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<b>Abstract</b>: The thaw and release of carbon currently frozen in permafrost will increase atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations and amplify surface warming to initiate a positive permafrost carbon feedback (PCF) on climate. We use surface weather from three global climate models based on the moderate warming, A1B Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emissions scenario and the SiBCASA land surface model to estimate the strength and timing of the PCF and associated uncertainty. By 2200, we predict a 29-59% decrease in permafrost area and a 53-97 cm increase in active layer thickness. By 2200, the PCF strength in terms of cumulative permafrost carbon flux to the atmosphere is 190&plusmn;64 gigatonnes of carbon. This estimate may be low because it does not account for amplified surface warming due to the PCF itself and excludes some discontinuous permafrost regions where SiBCASA did not simulate permafrost. We predict that the PCF will change the arctic from a carbon sink to a source after the mid-2020s and is strong enough to cancel 42-88% of the total global land sink. The thaw and decay of permafrost carbon is irreversible and accounting for the PCF will require larger reductions in fossil fuel emissions to reach a target atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Particularly interesting is the slowing of thermohaline circulation.  In John Nissen&#8217;s &quot;two scenarios&quot; work there&#8217;s an uncomfortably cool future&mdash;if the Gulf Stream were to be diverted by meltwater flowing into NW Atlantic. There&#8217;s also an unbearably hot future, if the methane from not-so-permafrost and causes global warming to spiral out of control. So we have a terrifying menu.</p>
<p>
<b>JB</b>: I recently interviewed Nathan Urban here.  He explained a paper where he estimated the chance that the Atlantic current you&#8217;re talking about could collapse.  (Technically, it&#8217;s the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, not quite the same as the Gulf Stream.)  They got a 10% chance of it happening in two centuries, assuming a business as usual scenario.  But there are a lot of uncertainties in the modeling here.</p>
<p>
Back to geoengineering.  I want to talk about some ways it could go wrong, how soon we&#8217;d find out if it did, and what we could do then.</p>
<p>
For example, you say we&#8217;ll put sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere below 15 kilometers, and most of the ozone is above 20 kilometers. That&#8217;s good, but then I wonder how much sulfur dioxide will diffuse upwards. As the name suggests, the stratosphere is &quot;stratified&quot; &mdash;there&#8217;s not much turbulence.  That&#8217;s reassuring. But I guess one reason to do experiments is to see exactly what really happens. </p>
<p>
<b>GB</b>: It&#8217;s really the only way to go forward. I fear we are now in the Decade of Dithering that will end with the deadly 2020s. Only then will experiments get done and issues engaged. All else, as tempting as ideas and simulations are, spell delay if they do not couple with real field experiments&mdash;from nozzle sizes on up to albedo measures &mdash;which finally decide.</p>
<p>
<b>JB</b>:  Okay.  But what are some other things that could go wrong with this sulfur dioxide scheme?  I know you&#8217;re not eager to focus on the dangers, but you must be able to imagine some plausible ones: you&#8217;re an SF writer, after all.  If you say you can&#8217;t think of any, I won&#8217;t believe you!   And part of good design is looking for possible failure modes.</p>
<p>
<b>GB</b>: Plenty can go wrong with so vast an idea. But we can learn from volcanoes, that give us useful experiments, though sloppy and noisy ones, about putting aerosols into the air. Monitoring those can teach us a lot with little expense.</p>
<p>
We can fail to get the aerosols to avoid clumping, so they fall out too fast. Or we can somehow trigger a big shift in rainfall patterns&mdash;a special danger in a system already loaded with surplus energy, as is already displaying anomalies like the bitter winters in Europe, floods in Pakistan, drought in Darfur. Indeed, some of Alan Robock&#8217;s simulations of Arctic aerosol use show a several percent decline in monsoon rain&mdash;though that may be a plus, since flooding is the #1 cause of death and destruction during the Indian monsoon.</p>
<p>
Mostly, it might just plain fail to work. Guessing outcomes is useless, though.  Here&#8217;s where experiment rules, not simulations.  This is engineering, which learns from mistakes. Consider the early days of aviation. Having more time to develop and test a system gives more time to learn how to avoid unwanted impacts.  Of course, having a system ready also increases the probability of premature deployment; life is about choices and dangers.
</p>
<p>
More important right now than developing capability, is understanding the consequences of deployment of that capability by doing field experiments.  One thing we know: both science and engineering advance most quickly by using the dance of theory with experiment.  Neglecting this, preferring only experiment, is a fundamental mistake.</p>
<p>
<b>JB</b>:  Switching gears slightly: in March last year you went to the <a>Asilomar Conference</a> on climate intervention technologies.   I&#8217;ve read the report:</p>
<p>
&bull; Asilomar Scientific Organizing Committee, <a href="http://climate.org/PDF/AsilomarConferenceReport.pdf"><i>The Asilomar Conference Recommendations on Principles for Research into Climate Engineering Techniques</i></a>, Climate Institute, Washington DC, 2010.</p>
<p>
It seems unobjectionable and a bit bland, no doubt deliberately so, with recommendations like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
&quot;Public participation and consultation in research planning and oversight, assessments, and development of decision-making mechanisms and processes must be provided.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<p>
What were some interesting things that you learned there?  And what&#8217;ll happen next?</p>
<p>
<b>GB</b>: It was the Woodstock of the policy wonks. I found it depressing. Not much actual science got discussed, and most just fearlessly called for more research, forming of panels and committees, etc. This is how bureaucracy digests a problem, turning it quite often into fertilizer.</p>
<p>
I&#8217;m a physicist who does both theory and experiment. I want to see work that combines those to give us real information and paths to follow. I don&#8217;t see that anywhere now. Congress might hand out money for it but after the <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d10903.pdf">GAO report on geoengineering</a> last September there seems little movement.</p>
<p>
I did see some people pushing their carbon capture companies, to widespread disbelief. The simple things we could do right now like our CROPS carbon capture proposal are neglected, while entrepreneur companies hope for a government scheme to pay for sucking CO<sub>2</sub> from the air. That&#8217;ll be the day!&mdash;far into the crisis, I think, maybe several decades from now.  I also saw fine ideas pushed aside in favor of policy wonk initiatives. It was a classic triumph of process over results. As is many areas dominated by social scientists, people seemed to be saying, &quot;Nobody can blame us if we go through the motions.”</p>
<p>
That Decade of Dithering is upon us now.  The great danger is that tipping points may not be obvious, even as we cross them. They may present as small events that nonetheless take us over an horizon from which we can never return. </p>
<p>
For example, the loss of Greenland ice. Once the ice sheet melts down to an altitude below that needed to maintain it, we&#8217;ve lost it. The melt lubricates the glacier base and starts a slide we cannot stop. There are proposals of how to block that&mdash;essentially, draw the water out from the base as fast as it appears&mdash;but nobody&#8217;s funding such studies.  </p>
<p>
A reasonable, ongoing climate control program might cost $100 million annually. That includes small field experiments, trials with spraying aerosols, etc. We now spend about $5 billion per year globally studying the problem, so climate control studies would be 1/50 of that.</p>
<p>
Even now, we may already be too late for a tipping point&mdash;we still barely glimpse the horrors we could be visiting on our children and their grandchildren&#8217;s grandchildren. </p>
<p>
<b>JB</b>: I think a lot of young people are eager to do something.  What would be your advice, especially to future scientists and engineers?  What should they do?  The problems seem so huge, and most so-called &quot;adults&quot; are shirking their responsibilities&mdash;perhaps hoping they&#8217;ll be dead before things get too bad.</p>
<p>
<b>GB</b>: One reason people are paralyzed is simple: major interests would get hurt&mdash;coal, oil, etc. The fossil fuel industry is the second largest in the world; #1 is agriculture. We have ~50 trillion dollars of infrastructure invested in it. That and inertia&mdash;we&#8217;ve made the crucial fuel of our world a Bad Thing, and prohibition never works with free people.  Look at the War on Drugs, now nearing its 40th anniversary.</p>
<p>
That&#8217;s why I think adaptation&mdash;dikes, water conservation, reflecting roofs and blacktop to cool cities and lower their heating costs, etc.&mdash; is a smart way to prepare. We should also fund research in mineral weathering as a way to lock up CO<sub>2</sub>, which not only consumes CO<sub>2</sub> but it can also generate ocean alkalinity. The acidification of the oceans is undeniable, easily measured, and accelerating.  Plus geoengineering, which is probably the only fairly cheap, quick way to damp the coming chaos for a while. A stopgap, but we&#8217;re going to need plenty of those.</p>
<p>
<b>JB</b>: And finally, what about you?  What are you doing these days?  Science fiction?  Science?  A bit of both? </p>
<p>
Both, plus. Last year I published a look at how we viewed the future in the 20th Century, <i><a href="http://www.tor.com/stories/2010/10/the-wonderful-future-that-never-was-by-gregory-benford-and-the-editors-of-popular-mechanics">The Wonderful Future We Never Had</a></i>, and have a novel in progress now cowritten with Larry Niven&mdash;about a Really Big Object. Plus some short stories and journalism.</p>
<p>
My identical twin brother Jim &amp; I published several papers looking at SETI from the perspective of those who would pay the bills for a SETI beacon, and reached conclusions opposite from what the SETI searches of the last half century have sought. Instead of steady, narrowband signals near 1 GHz, it is orders of magnitude cheaper to radiate pulsed, broadband beacon signals nearer 10 GHz. This suggests new way to look for pulsed signals, which some are trying to find. We may have been looking for the wrong thing all along. The papers are on the arXiv:</p>

<p>
For math types, David Wolpert and I have shown that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcomb%27s_paradox">Newcomb&#8217;s paradox</a> arises from confusions in the statement, so is not a paradox:</p>
<p>
&bull; David H. Wolpert and Gregory Benford, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.2540">What does Newcomb&#8217;s paradox teach us?</a></p>
<p>
<b>JB</b>: The next guest on this show, Eliezer Yudkowsky, has <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/nc/newcombs_problem_and_regret_of_rationality/">also written</a> about Newcomb&#8217;s paradox.  I should probably say what it is, just for folks who haven&#8217;t heard yet.  I&#8217;ll quote Yudkowsky&#8217;s formulation, since it&#8217;s nice and snappy:</p>
<blockquote><p>
A superintelligence from another galaxy, whom we shall call Omega, comes to Earth and sets about playing a strange little game.  In this game, Omega selects a human being, sets down two boxes in front of them, and flies away.</p>
<p>
Box A is transparent and contains a thousand dollars.<br />
Box B is opaque, and contains either a million dollars, or nothing.</p>
<p>
You can take both boxes, or take only box B.</p>
<p>
And the twist is that Omega has put a million dollars in box B if and only if Omega has predicted that you will take only box B.</p>
<p>
Omega has been correct on each of 100 observed occasions so far&mdash;everyone who took both boxes has found box B empty and received only a thousand dollars; everyone who took only box B has found B containing a million dollars.  (We assume that box A vanishes in a puff of smoke if you take only box B; no one else can take box A afterward.)</p>
<p>
Before you make your choice, Omega has flown off and moved on to its next game.  Box B is already empty or already full.</p>
<p>
Omega drops two boxes on the ground in front of you and flies off.</p>
<p>
Do you take both boxes, or only box B?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you say you&#8217;d take both boxes, I&#8217;ll argue that&#8217;s stupid: everyone who did that so far got just a thousand dollars, while the folks who took only box B got a million!</p>
<p>
If you say you&#8217;d take only box B, I&#8217;ll argue <i>that&#8217;s</i> stupid: there has <i>got</i> to be more money in <i>both</i> boxes than in just <i>one</i> of them!</p>
<p>
So, this puzzle has a kind of demonic attraction.  Lots of people have written about it, though personally I&#8217;m waiting until a superintelligence from another galaxy actually shows up and performs this stunt.  </p>
<p>
Hmm&mdash;I see your paper uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network">Bayesian networks</a>!  I&#8217;ve been starting to think about those lately.
</p>
<p>
But I know that&#8217;s not all you&#8217;ve been doing.</p>
<p>
<b>GB</b>: I also started several biotech companies 5 years ago, spurred in part by the agonizing experience of watching my wife die of cancer for decades, ending in 2002. They&#8217;re genomics companies devoted to <a href="http://vimeo.com/7336479">extending human longevity</a> by upregulating genes we know confer some defenses against cardio, neurological and other diseases. Our first product just came out, StemCell100, and did well in animal and human trials. </p>
<p>
So I&#8217;m staying busy. The world gets more interesting all the time. Compared with growing up in the farm country of Alabama, this is a fine way to live.</p>
<p>
<b>JB</b>: It&#8217;s been great to hear what you&#8217;re up to.  Best of luck on all these projects, and thanks for answering my questions!</p>

<i>Few doubt that our climate stands in a class by itself in terms of complexity. Though much is made of how wondrous our minds are, perhaps the most complex entity known is our biosphere, in which we are mere mayflies. Absent a remotely useful theory of complexity in systems, we must proceed cautiously.</i> &#8211; Gregory Benford</p>

				<small>5 January, 2011</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>Happy New Year!  </p>
<p>I just got back from Hanoi.  I think I love it.  It&#8217;s a fascinating city, full of street vendors and craftsmen and twisting back alleys and deep &#8216;tunnel houses&#8217; and Buddhist temples and more.  It&#8217;s over a thousand years old, layered with history.  The Vietnamese have taken culture from all the more powerful countries that tried to invade them &mdash; the Chinese, the French, the Americans &mdash; and made it their own.  You can see it all here.</p>
<p>At first I hated Hanoi.  In the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=hanoi+old+quarter">Old Quarter</a>, the roads are packed with motorbikes zipping in all directions &mdash; and the sidewalks are all used either as motorbike parking lots, or restaurants with people sitting on little plastic chairs, so you pretty much need to walk in the road a lot of the time.   Traffic lights are few and rarely heeded.  </p>
<p>It seems like a pedestrian&#8217;s worst nightmare.  Try walking across this:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://www.gadling.com/2010/01/20/south-by-southeast-hit-and-run-hanoi/"><br />
<img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.blogcdn.com/www.gadling.com/media/2010/01/hanoi-motorbikes.jpg" /></a>
</div>
<p>But on my first night there, I ran in a philosopher friend from Singapore, an expert on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_paradox">Moore&#8217;s paradox</a>: John Williams.   He was sitting in a bar, looking out the door, watching the world go by.  Strange coincidence!   </p>
<p>So we had a beer, and I relaxed a bit, and I noticed that the traffic is actually governed by a set of unwritten rules that you can learn by watching.  Little old ladies or gaggles of laughing teenagers can stroll across the street, motorbikes whizzing past them in both directions, and not get hurt!  And so can you, once you learn what to do.</p>
<p>And then the fun starts.  There&#8217;s way, way, <i>way</i> too much to tell you about, so I won&#8217;t even try now.  Maybe later, probably on my <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/diary/index.html#now">diary</a>.</p>
<p>I think Jeremy Kressman  <a href="http://www.gadling.com/2010/01/20/south-by-southeast-hit-and-run-hanoi/">said it right</a>: &#8220;You don&#8217;t just visit Hanoi. Hanoi visits you.&#8221; The picture above is from his blog.  I&#8217;ll replace it with one of my own as soon as I get around to downloading my photos.</p>
<p>But as I&#8217;ve already hinted, this blog entry is not really about Hanoi.  It&#8217;s about a new collection of SF stories, all tackling the theme of global warming:</p>
<p>&bull;  Gordon Van Gelder, editor, <a href="http://www.orbooks.com/our-books/greenhouse/"><i>Welcome to the Greenhouse</i></a>, O/R Books, 2011.</p>
<p>It includes stories by Brian W. Aldiss, Jeff Carlson, Judith Moffett, Matthew Hughes, Gregory Benford, Michael Alexander, Bruce Sterling, Joseph Green, Pat MacEwen, Alan Dean Foster, David Prill, George Guthridge, Paul Di Filippo, Chris Lawson, Ray Vukcevich and M. J. Locke.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s long past time for SF writers to start envisioning the world we seem to be heading towards.  Were some of these stories published a while ago?  Have you read any of them?  Are they any good?</p>
<p>This item was pointed out to me by David Roberts.  And by the way: in case you missed it, check out the global warming game that Giampiero Campa brought to our attention:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.fateoftheworld.net/">Fate of the World</a>, website.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not free, but Giampiero <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/12/23/adapting-to-a-hotter-earth/#comment-3285">says it&#8217;s fun</a>, and I trust him.  He wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But don’t waste your time, winning is plain impossible!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but then later:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I take it back, I have finally won today, which basically means that I got to the year 2120 with less than 3 degrees increment without destroying civilization. I mean, Latin America has to be rebuilt and there’s war raging in China, but other than that, it’s an excellent result :-)</p>
</blockquote>

				<small>24 December, 2010</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>
Last week we met the El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation, or ENSO.  I like to explain things as I learn about them.  So, often I look back and find my explanations naive.  But this time it took less than a week!
</p>
<p>
What did it was reading this:</p>
<p>
&bull; J. D. Neelin, D. S. Battisti, A. C. Hirst <i>et al.</i>, <a href="http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/MET/Faculty/jff/1998_03%20ENSO%20theory.pdf">ENSO theory</a>, <i><a href="http://www.agu.org/journals/ABS/1998/97JC03424.shtml">J. Geophys. Res.</a></i> <b>103</b> (1998), 14261-14290.
</p>
<p>
I wouldn&#8217;t recommend this to the faint of heart.  It&#8217;s a bit terrifying.  It&#8217;s well-written, but it tells the long and tangled tale of how theories of the ENSO phenomenon evolved from 1969 to 1998 &mdash; a period that saw much progress, but did <i>not</i> end with a neat, clean understanding of this phenomenon.   It&#8217;s packed with hundreds of references, and sprinkled with somewhat intimidating remarks like:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
The Fourier-decomposed longitude and time dependence of these eigensolutions obey dispersion relations familiar to every physical oceanographer&#8230;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Nonetheless I found it fascinating &mdash; so, I&#8217;ll pick off one small idea and explain it now.</p>
<p>
As I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve heard, climate science involves some extremely complicated models: some of the most complex known to science.   But it also involves models of lesser complexity, like the &quot;box model&quot; explained by Nathan Urban in &quot;<a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week304.html">week304</a>&quot;.  And it also involves some extremely simple models that are designed to isolate some interesting phenomena and display them in their Platonic ideal form, stripped of all distractions.</p>
<p>
Because of their simplicity, these models are great for mathematicians to think about: we can even prove theorems about them!  And simplicity goes along with generality, so the simplest models of all tend to be applicable &mdash; in a rough way &mdash; not just to the Earth&#8217;s climate, but to a vast number of systems.  They are, one might say, <i>general possibilities of behavior</i>.
</p>
<p>
Of course, we can&#8217;t expect simple models to describe complicated real-world situations very accurately.  That&#8217;s not what they&#8217;re good for.  So, even calling them &quot;models&quot; could be a bit misleading.  It might be better to call them &quot;patterns&quot;: patterns that can help organize our thinking about complex systems.  </p>
<p>
There&#8217;s a nice mathematical theory of these patterns&#8230; indeed, several such theories.  But instead of taking a top-down approach, which gets a bit abstract, I&#8217;d rather tell you about some examples, which I can illustrate using pictures.  But I didn&#8217;t make these pictures.  They were created by <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Tim+van+Beek">Tim van Beek</a> as part of the Azimuth Code Project.  The <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Azimuth+code+project">Azimuth Code Project</a> is a way for programmers to help save the planet.  More about that later, at the end of this article.
</p>
<p>
As we saw last time, the ENSO cycle relies crucially on interactions between the ocean and atmosphere.  In some models, we can artificially adjust the strength of these interactions, and we find something interesting.  If we set the interaction strength to less than a certain amount, the Pacific Ocean will settle down to a stable equilibrium state.  But when we turn it up past that point, we instead see periodic oscillations!  Instead of a stable equilibrium state where nothing happens, we have a stable <i>cycle</i>.

This pattern, or at least one pattern of this sort, is called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopf_bifurcation">&quot;Hopf bifurcation&quot;</a>.  There are various differential equations that exhibit a Hopf bifurcation, but here&#8217;s my favorite:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7Bd+x%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D++-y+%2B+%5Cbeta++x+-+x+%28x%5E2+%2B+y%5E2%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;frac{d x}{d t} =  -y + &#92;beta  x - x (x^2 + y^2) " class="latex" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7Bd+y%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D++%5C%3B+x+%2B+%5Cbeta++y+-+y+%28x%5E2+%2B+y%5E2%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;frac{d y}{d t} =  &#92;; x + &#92;beta  y - y (x^2 + y^2) " class="latex" /></p>
<p>
Here <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y" class="latex" /> are functions of time, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="t" class="latex" />, so these equations describe a point moving around on the plane.  It&#8217;s easier to see what&#8217;s going on in polar coordinates:
</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7Bd+r%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D+%5Cbeta+r+-+r%5E3+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;frac{d r}{d t} = &#92;beta r - r^3 " class="latex" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7Bd+%5Ctheta%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D+1+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;frac{d &#92;theta}{d t} = 1 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>
The angle <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;theta" class="latex" /> goes around at a constant rate while the radius <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r" class="latex" /> does something more interesting.  When <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta+%5Cle+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta &#92;le 0" class="latex" />, you can see that any solution spirals in towards the origin!  Or, if it starts at the origin, it stays there.  So, we call the origin a &quot;stable equilibrium&quot;.
</p>
<p>
Here&#8217;s a typical solution for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta+%3D+-1%2F4&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta = -1/4" class="latex" />, drawn as a curve in the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x y" class="latex" /> plane.  As time passes, the solution spirals in towards the origin:

<img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/No_Limit_Circle_No_Noise.jpg" />
</div>
</p>
<p>
The equations are more interesting for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta+%3E+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta &gt; 0" class="latex" />.  Then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=dr%2Fdt+%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="dr/dt = 0" class="latex" /> whenever
</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta+r+-+r%5E3+%3D+0+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta r - r^3 = 0 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>
This has two solutions, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r+%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r = 0" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r+%3D+%5Csqrt%7B%5Cbeta%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r = &#92;sqrt{&#92;beta}" class="latex" />.   Since <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r+%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r = 0" class="latex" /> is a solution, the origin is still an equilibrium.  But now it&#8217;s not stable: if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r" class="latex" /> is between <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="0" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B%5Cbeta%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;sqrt{&#92;beta}" class="latex" />, we&#8217;ll have <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta+r+-+r%5E3+%3E+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta r - r^3 &gt; 0" class="latex" />, so our solution will spiral <i>out</i>, away from the origin and towards the circle <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r+%3D+%5Csqrt%7B%5Cbeta%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r = &#92;sqrt{&#92;beta}" class="latex" />.  So, we say the origin is an &quot;unstable equilibrium&quot;.  On the other hand, if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r" class="latex" /> starts out bigger than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B%5Cbeta%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;sqrt{&#92;beta}" class="latex" />, our solution will spiral in towards that circle.
</p>
<p>
Here&#8217;s a picture of two solutions for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta+%3D+1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta = 1" class="latex" />:

</div>
</p>
<p>
The red solution starts near the origin and spirals out towards the circle <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r+%3D+%5Csqrt%7B%5Cbeta%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r = &#92;sqrt{&#92;beta}" class="latex" />.  The green solution starts outside this circle and spirals in towards it, soon becoming indistinguishable from the circle itself.  So, this equation describes a system where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y" class="latex" /> quickly settle down to a periodic oscillating behavior.</p>
<p>
Since solutions that start anywhere near the circle <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r+%3D+%5Csqrt%7B%5Cbeta%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r = &#92;sqrt{&#92;beta}" class="latex" /> will keep going round and round getting closer to this circle, it&#8217;s called a &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit-cycle">stable limit cycle</a>&quot;.
</p>
<p>
This is what the Hopf bifurcation is all about!  We&#8217;ve got a dynamical system that depends on a parameter, and as we change this parameter, a stable fixed point become unstable, and a stable limit cycle forms around it.
</p>
<p>
This isn&#8217;t quite a mathematical definition yet, but it&#8217;s close enough for now.  If you want something a bit more precise, try:

</p>
<p>
Now, clearly the Hopf bifurcation idea is too simple for describing real-world weather cycles like the ENSO.  In the Hopf bifurcation, our system settles down into an orbit very close to the limit cycle, which is perfectly periodic.  The ENSO cycle is only <i>roughly</i> periodic:

The time between El Ni&ntilde;os varies between 3 and 7 years, averaging around 4 years.  There can also be two El Ni&ntilde;os without an intervening La Ni&ntilde;a, or vice versa.  One can try to explain this in various ways.
</p>
<p>
One very simple, general idea to add random noise to whatever differential equation we were using to model the ENSO cycle, obtaining a so-called <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Stochastic+differential+equation">stochastic differential equation</a>: a differential equation describing a <i>random</i> process.  Richard Kleeman discusses this idea in Tim Palmer&#8217;s book:</p>
<p>
&bull; Richard Kleeman, <a href="http://www.pims.math.ca/files/kleeman_6.pdf">Stochastic theories for the irregularity of ENSO</a>, in <i>Stochastic Physics and Climate Modelling</i>, eds. Tim Palmer and Paul Williams, Cambridge U. Press, Cambridge, 2010, pp. 248-265.
</p>
<p>
Kleeman mentions three general theories for the irregularity of the ENSO.  They all involve the idea of separating the weather into &quot;modes&quot; &mdash; roughly speaking, different ways that things can oscillate.  Some modes are slow and some are fast.  The ENSO cycle is defined by the behavior of certain slow modes, but of course these interact with the fast modes.  So, there are various options:
</p>
<ol>
<p><li>
Perhaps the relevant slow modes interact with each other in a chaotic way.
</li>
</p>
<p><li>
Perhaps the relevant slow modes interact with each other in a non-chaotic way, but also interact with chaotic fast modes, which inject noise into what would otherwise be simple periodic behavior.
</li>
</p>
<p><li>
Perhaps the relevant slow modes interact with each other in a chaotic way, and also interact in a significant way with chaotic fast modes.
</li>
</p>
</ol>
<p>
Kleeman reviews work on the first option but focuses on the second.  The third option is the most complicated, so the pessimist in me suspects that&#8217;s what&#8217;s really going on.  Still, it&#8217;s good to start by studying simple models!
</p>
<p>
How can we get a simple model that illustrates the second option?  Simple: take the model we just saw, and add some noise!  This idea is discussed in detail here:

</p>
<p>
This paper is not about the ENSO cycle, but another one, which is often nicknamed the <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Atlantic+multidecadal+oscillation">AMO</a>.  I would love to talk about it &mdash; but not now.  Let me just show you the equations for a Hopf bifurcation with noise:
</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7Bd+x%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D++-y+%2B+%5Cbeta++x+-+x+%28x%5E2+%2B+y%5E2%29+%2B+%5Clambda+%5Cfrac%7Bd+W_1%7D%7Bd+t%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;frac{d x}{d t} =  -y + &#92;beta  x - x (x^2 + y^2) + &#92;lambda &#92;frac{d W_1}{d t}" class="latex" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7Bd+y%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D++%5C%3B+x+%2B+%5Cbeta++y+-+y+%28x%5E2+%2B+y%5E2%29+%2B+%5Clambda+%5Cfrac%7Bd+W_2%7D%7Bd+t%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;frac{d y}{d t} =  &#92;; x + &#92;beta  y - y (x^2 + y^2) + &#92;lambda &#92;frac{d W_2}{d t}" class="latex" /></p>
<p>
They&#8217;re the same as before, but with some new extra terms at the end: that&#8217;s the noise.
</p>
<p>
This could easily get a bit technical, but I don&#8217;t want it to.  So, I&#8217;ll just say some buzzwords and let you click on the links if you want more detail.  <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W_1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="W_1" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W_2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="W_2" class="latex" /> are two independent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_process">Wiener processes</a>, so they describe <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion">Brownian motion</a> in the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y" class="latex" /> coordinates.  When we differentiate a Wiener process we get <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise">white noise</a>.  So, we&#8217;re adding some amount of white noise to the equations we had before, and the number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;lambda" class="latex" /> says precisely how much.  That means that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y" class="latex" /> are no longer specific functions of time: they&#8217;re <i>random</i> functions, also known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_process">stochastic processes</a>.
</p>
<p>
If this were a math course, I&#8217;d feel obliged to precisely define all the terms I just dropped on you.  But it&#8217;s not, so I&#8217;ll just show you some pictures!
</p>
<p>
If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta+%3D+1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta = 1" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda+%3D+0.1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;lambda = 0.1" class="latex" />, here are some typical solutions:</p>
<p><div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/Limit_Circle_Noise_01.jpg" />
</div>
</p>
<p>
They look similar to the solutions we saw before for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta+%3D+1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta = 1" class="latex" />, but now they have some random wiggles added on.
</p>
<p>
(You may be wondering what this picture really shows.  After all, I said the solutions were random functions of time, not specific functions.  But it&#8217;s tough to draw a &quot;random function&quot;.   So, to get one of the curves shown above, what Tim did is randomly choose a function according to some rule for computing probabilities, and draw that.)
</p>
<p>
If we turn up the noise, our solutions get more wiggly.  If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta+%3D+1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta = 1" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda+%3D+0.3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;lambda = 0.3" class="latex" />, they look like this:</p>
<p><div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/Limit_Circle_Noise_03.jpg" />
</div>
</p>
<p>
In these examples, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta+%3E+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta &gt; 0" class="latex" />, so we would have a limit cycle if there weren&#8217;t any noise &mdash; and you can see that even with noise, the solutions <i>approximately</i> tend towards the limit cycle.  So, we can use an equation of this sort to describe systems that oscillate, but in a somewhat random way.
</p>
<p>
But now comes the really interesting part!  Suppose <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta+%5Cle+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta &#92;le 0" class="latex" />.  Then we&#8217;ve seen that without noise, there&#8217;s no limit cycle: any solution quickly spirals in towards the origin.  But with noise, something a bit different happens.  If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta+%3D+-1%2F4&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta = -1/4" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda+%3D+0.1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;lambda = 0.1" class="latex" /> we get a picture like this:
</p>
<p><div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/No_Limit_Circle_Noise_01.jpg" />
</div>
</p>
<p>
We get irregular oscillations even though there&#8217;s no limit cycle!  Roughly speaking, the noise keeps knocking the solution away from the stable fixed point at <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%3D+y+%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x = y = 0" class="latex" />, so it keeps going round and round, but in an irregular way.  It may seem to be spiralling in, but if we waited a bit longer it would get kicked out again.
</p>
<p>
This is a lot easier to see if we plot just <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> as a function of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="t" class="latex" />.  Then we can run our solution for a longer time without the picture becoming a horrible mess:

<img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/No_Limit_Circle_Noise_01_Graph.jpg" />
</div>
</p>
<p>
If you compare this with the ENSO cycle, you&#8217;ll see they look roughly similar:</p>

That&#8217;s nice.  Of course it doesn&#8217;t prove that a model based on a Hopf bifurcation plus noise is &quot;right&quot; &mdash; indeed, we don&#8217;t really <i>have</i> a model until we&#8217;ve chosen variables for both <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y" class="latex" />.  But it suggests that a model of this sort could be worth studying.
</p>
<p>
If you want to see how the Hopf bifurcation plus noise is applied to climate cycles, I suggest starting with <a href="http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/366/1875/2543.full.pdf">the paper by Dijkstra, Frankcombe and von der Heydt</a>.  If you want to see it applied to the El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation, start with Section 6.3 of <a href="http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/MET/Faculty/jff/1998_03%20ENSO%20theory.pdf">the ENSO theory paper</a>, and then dig into the many references.  Here it seems a model with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta+%3E+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta &gt; 0" class="latex" /> may work best.  If so, noise is not required to keep the ENSO cycle going, but it makes the cycle irregular.
</p>
<p>
To a mathematician like me, what&#8217;s really interesting is how the addition of noise &quot;smooths out&quot; the Hopf bifurcation.  When there&#8217;s no noise, the qualitative behavior of solutions jumps drastically at <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta+%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta = 0" class="latex" />.  For <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta+%5Cle+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta &#92;le 0" class="latex" /> we have a stable equilibrium, while for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta+%3E+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta &gt; 0" class="latex" /> we have a stable limit cycle.  But in the presence of noise, we get irregular cycles not only for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta+%3E+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta &gt; 0" class="latex" /> but also <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta+%5Cle+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta &#92;le 0" class="latex" />.  This is not really surprising, but it suggests a bunch of questions.  Such as: what are some quantities we can use to describe the behavior of &quot;irregular cycles&quot;, and how do these quantities change as a function of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;lambda" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;beta" class="latex" />?
</p>
<p>
You&#8217;ll see some answers to this question in Dijkstra, Frankcombe and von der Heydt&#8217;s paper.  However, if you&#8217;re a mathematician, you&#8217;ll instantly think of dozens more questions &mdash; like, how can I <i>prove</i> what these guys are saying?
</p>
<p>
If you make any progress, let me know.  If you don&#8217;t know where to start, you might try the Dijkstra <i>et al.</i> paper, and then learn a bit about the Hopf bifurcation, stochastic processes, and stochastic differential equations:

Now, about the <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Azimuth+code+project">Azimuth Code Project</a>.  Tim van Beek started it just recently, but the <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/HomePage">Azimuth Project</a> seems to be attracting people who can program, so I have high hopes for it.  Tim wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
My main objectives to start the Azimuth Code Project were:</p>
<p>
&bull; to have a central repository for the code used for simulations or data analysis on the Azimuth Project,
</p>
<p>
&bull; to have an online free access repository and make all software open source, to enable anyone to use the software, for example to reproduce the results on the Azimuth Project.  Also to show by example that this can and should be done for every scientific publication.
</p>
<p>
Of less importance is:
</p>
<p>
&bull; to implement the software with an eye to software engineering principles.
</p>
<p>
This less important because the world of numerical high performance computing differs significantly from the rest of the software industry: it has special requirements and it is not clear at all which paradigms that are useful for the rest will turn out to be useful here. Nevertheless I&#8217;m confident that parts of the scientific community will profit from a closer interaction with software engineering.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
So, if you like programming, I hope you&#8217;ll <a href="http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Mathforge/Azimuth/comments.php?DiscussionID=262&amp;page=1#Item_5">chat with us</a> and consider joining in!  Our next projects involve limit cycles in predator-prey models, stochastic resonance in some theories of the ice ages, and delay differential equations in ENSO models.

					<p><a href="http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Mathforge/Azimuth/comments.php?DiscussionID=312&amp;Focus=1614#Comment_1614">Over on the Azimuth Forum</a>, Staffan Liljegren pointed out a good article in <i>The Economist</i>:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/17572735?story_id=17572735&amp;CFID=151720250&amp;CFTOKEN=97212424">Facing the consequences</a>, <i>The Economist</i>, 25 November 2010.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to quote the beginning, and hope that lures you into reading the rest.  This is important stuff!</p>
<blockquote><p>
<b>Adapting to climate change</b></p>
<p><b>Facing the consequences</b></p>
<p><b>Global action is not going to stop climate change. The world needs to look harder at how to live with it.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>ON NOVEMBER 29th representatives of countries from around the world will gather in Cancún, Mexico, for the first high-level climate talks since those in Copenhagen last December. The organisers hope the meeting in Mexico, unlike the one in Denmark, will be unshowy but solid, leading to decisions about finance, forestry and technology transfer that will leave the world better placed to do something about global warming. Incremental progress is possible, but continued deadlock is likelier. What is out of reach, as at Copenhagen, is agreement on a plausible programme for keeping climate change in check.</p>
<p>The world warmed by about 0.7°C in the 20th century. Every year in this century has been warmer than all but one in the last (1998, since you ask). If carbon-dioxide levels were magically to stabilise where they are now (almost 390 parts per million, 40% more than before the industrial revolution) the world would probably warm by a further half a degree or so as the ocean, which is slow to change its temperature, caught up. But CO<sub>2</sub> levels continue to rise. Despite 20 years of climate negotiation, the world is still on an emissions trajectory that fits pretty easily into the “business as usual” scenarios drawn up by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).</p>
<p>The Copenhagen accord, a non-binding document which was the best that could be salvaged from the summit, talks of trying to keep the world less than 2°C warmer than in pre-industrial times—a level that is rather arbitrarily seen as the threshold for danger. Many countries have, in signing the accord, promised actions that will or should reduce carbon emissions. In the <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/World+Energy+Outlook+2010">World Energy Outlook</a>, recently published by the International Energy Agency, an assessment of these promises forms the basis of a “new policies scenario” for the next 25 years (see chart 1). According to the IEA, the scenario puts the world on course to warm by 3.5°C by 2100. For comparison, the difference in global mean temperature between the pre-industrial age and the ice ages was about 6°C.</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/17572735?story_id=17572735&amp;CFID=151720250&amp;CFTOKEN=97212424"><br />
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/media.economist.com/images/images-magazine/2010/11/27/bb/20101127_bbc692.gif" alt="" /><br />
</a></div>
<p>The IEA also looked at what it might take to hit a two-degree target; the answer, says the agency’s chief economist, Fatih Birol, is “too good to be believed”. Every signatory of the Copenhagen accord would have to hit the top of its range of commitments. That would provide a worldwide rate of decarbonisation (reduction in carbon emitted per unit of GDP) twice as large in the decade to come as in the one just past: 2.8% a year, not 1.4%. Mr Birol notes that the highest annual rate on record is 2.5%, in the wake of the first oil shock.</p>
<p>But for the two-degree scenario 2.8% is just the beginning; from 2020 to 2035 the rate of decarbonisation needs to double again, to 5.5%. Though they are unwilling to say it in public, the sheer improbability of such success has led many climate scientists, campaigners and policymakers to conclude that, in the words of Bob Watson, once the head of the IPCC and now the chief scientist at Britain’s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, “Two degrees is a wishful dream.”</p>
<p>The fight to limit global warming to easily tolerated levels is thus over. Analysts who have long worked on adaptation to climate change—finding ways to live with scarcer water, higher peak temperatures, higher sea levels and weather patterns at odds with those under which today’s settled patterns of farming developed—are starting to see their day in the uncomfortably hot sun. That such measures cannot protect everyone from all harm that climate change may bring does not mean that they should be ignored. On the contrary, they are sorely needed.

				<div class="entry">
					<p>
I&#8217;d like to take a break from interviews and explain some stuff I&#8217;m learning about. I&#8217;m eager to tell you about some papers in the book Tim Palmer helped edit, <i>Stochastic Physics and Climate Modelling</i>.   But those papers are highly theoretical, and theories aren&#8217;t very interesting until you know what they&#8217;re theories <i>of</i>.  So today I&#8217;ll talk about &quot;El Ni&ntilde;o&quot;, which is part of a very interesting climate cycle.  Next time I&#8217;ll get into more of the math.
</p>
<p>
I hadn&#8217;t originally planned to get into so much detail on the El Ni&ntilde;o, but this cycle is a big deal in southern California.  In the city of Riverside, where I live, it&#8217;s very dry.  There is a small river, but it&#8217;s just a trickle of water most of the time: there&#8217;s a lot less &quot;river&quot; than &quot;side&quot;.  It almost never rains between March and December.  Sometimes, during a &quot;La Ni&ntilde;a&quot;, it doesn&#8217;t even rain in the winter!  But then sometimes we have an &quot;El Ni&ntilde;o&quot; and get huge floods in the winter.  At this point, the tiny stream that gives Riverside its name swells to a huge raging torrent.  The difference is very dramatic.
</p>
<p>
So, I&#8217;ve always wanted to understand how the El Ni&ntilde;o cycle works &mdash; but whenever I tried to read an explanation, I couldn&#8217;t follow it!
</p>
<p>
I finally broke that mental block when I read some stuff on <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/kessler/">William Kessler</a>&#8216;s website.  He&#8217;s an expert on the El Ni&ntilde;o phenomenon who works at the <a href="http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/">Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory</a>.  One thing I like about his explanations is that he says what we <i>do</i> know about the El Ni&ntilde;o, and also what we <i>don&#8217;t</i> know.  We don&#8217;t know what triggers it!
</p>
<p>
In fact, Kessler says the El Ni&ntilde;o would make a great research topic for a smart young scientist.  In an email to me, which he has allowed me to quote, he said:</p>
<blockquote><p>
We understand lots of details but the big picture remains mysterious. And I enjoyed your interview with Tim Palmer because it brought out a lot of the sources of uncertainty in present-generation climate modeling. However, with El Ni&ntilde;o, the mystery is beyond Tim&#8217;s discussion of the difficulties of climate modeling. We do not know whether the tropical climate system on El Ni&ntilde;o timescales is stable (in which case El Ni&ntilde;o needs an external trigger, of which there are many candidates) or unstable. In the 80s and 90s we developed simple &quot;toy&quot; models that convinced the community that the system was unstable and  El Ni&ntilde;o could be expected to arise naturally within the tropical climate system. Now that is in doubt, and we are faced with a fundamental uncertainty about the very nature of the beast. Since none of us old farts has any new ideas (I just came back from a conference that reviewed this stuff), this is a fruitful field for a smart young person.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
So, I hope some smart young person reads this and dives into working on El Ni&ntilde;o!
</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s start at the beginning.  Why did I have so much trouble understanding explanations of the El Ni&ntilde;o?  Well, first of all, I&#8217;m an old fart.  Second, most people are bad at explaining stuff: they skip steps, use jargon they haven&#8217;t defined, and so on.  But third, climate cycles are hard to explain.  There&#8217;s a lot about them we don&#8217;t understand &mdash; as Kessler&#8217;s email points out.  And they also involve a kind of &quot;cyclic causality&quot; that&#8217;s a bit tough to mentally process.</p>
<p>
At least where I come from, people find it easy to understand linear chains of causality, like &quot;A causes B, which causes C&quot;.   For example: why is the king&#8217;s throne made of gold?  Because the king told his minister &quot;I want a throne of gold!&quot;  And the minister told the servant, &quot;Make a throne of gold!&quot;  And the servant made the king a throne of gold.
</p>
<p>
Now that&#8217;s what I call an explanation!  It&#8217;s incredibly satisfying, at least if you don&#8217;t wonder why the king wanted a throne of gold in the first place.  It&#8217;s easy to remember, because it sounds like a story.   We hear a lot of stories like this when we&#8217;re children, so we&#8217;re used to them.  My example sounds like the beginning of a fairy tale, where the action is initiated by a &quot;prime mover&quot;: the decree of a king.
</p>
<p>
There&#8217;s something a bit trickier about cyclic causality, like &quot;A causes B, which causes C, which causes A.&quot;  It may sound like a sneaky trick: we consider &quot;circular reasoning&quot; a bad thing.  Sometimes it <i>is</i> a sneaky trick.  But sometimes this is how things really work!
</p>
<p>
Why does big business have such influence in American politics?  Because big business hires lots of lobbyists, who talk to the politicians, and even give them money.  Why are they allowed to do this?  Because big business has such influence in American politics.  That&#8217;s an example of a &quot;vicious circle&quot;.  You might like to cut it off &mdash; but like a snake holding its tail in its mouth, it&#8217;s hard to know where to start.
</p>
<p>
Of course, not all circles are &quot;vicious&quot;.  Many are &quot;virtuous&quot;.
</p>
<p>
But the really tricky thing is how a circle can sometimes reverse direction.  In academia we worry about this a lot: we say a university can either &quot;ratchet up&quot; or &quot;ratchet down&quot;.  A good university attracts good students and good professors, who bring in more grant money, and all this makes it even better&#8230; while a bad university tends to get even worse, for all the same reasons.  But sometimes a good university goes bad, or vice versa.  Explaining that transition can be hard.
</p>
<p>
It&#8217;s also hard to explain why a La Ni&ntilde;a switches to an El Ni&ntilde;o, or vice versa.  Indeed, it seems scientists still don&#8217;t understand this. They have some models that simulate this process, but there are still lots of mysteries.  And even if they get models that work <i>perfectly</i>, they still may not be able to tell a good <i>story</i> about it.  Wind and water are ultimately described by partial differential equations, not fairy tales.
</p>
<p>
But anyway, let me tell you a story about how it works.  I&#8217;m just learning this stuff, so take it with a grain of salt&#8230;
</p>
<p>
The &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni%C3%B1o-Southern_Oscillation">El Ni&ntilde;o/Southern Oscillation</a>&quot; or &quot;ENSO&quot; is the largest form of variability in the Earth&#8217;s climate on times scales greater than a year and less than a decade. It occurs across the tropical Pacific Ocean every 3 to 7 years, and on average every 4 years.  It can cause extreme weather such as floods and droughts in many regions of the world.  Countries dependent on agriculture and fishing, especially those bordering the Pacific Ocean, are the most affected.
</p>
<p>
And here&#8217;s a cute little animation of it produced by the <a href="http://www.bom.gov.au/watl/about-weather-and-climate/australian-climate-influences.shtml?bookmark=enso">Australian Bureau of Meteorology</a>:
</p>
<p>
</p>

<img border="none" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ENSO_animation_australian_bureau_of_meteorology.gif" /><br />
</a>
</div>
</p>
<p>
Let me tell you first about La Ni&ntilde;a, and then El Ni&ntilde;o.  If you keep glancing back at this little animation, I promise you can understand everything I&#8217;ll say.
</p>
<p>
Winds called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_wind">trade winds</a> blow west across the tropical Pacific.  During La Ni&ntilde;a years, water at the ocean&#8217;s surface moves west with these winds, warming up in the sunlight as it goes.  So, warm water collects at the ocean&#8217;s surface in the western Pacific.  This creates more clouds and rainstorms in Asia.  Meanwhile, since surface water is being dragged west by the wind, cold water from below gets pulled up to take its place in the eastern Pacific, off the coast of South America.
</p>
<p>
I hope this makes sense so far.  But there&#8217;s another aspect to the story.   Because the ocean&#8217;s surface is warmer in the western Pacific, it heats the air and makes it rise.  So, wind blows west to fill the &quot;gap&quot; left by rising air.  This <i>strengthens</i> the westward-blowing trade winds.
</p>
<p>
So, it&#8217;s a kind of feedback loop: the oceans being warmer in the western Pacific helps the trade winds blow west, and that makes the western oceans even warmer.
</p>
<p>
Get it?  This should all make sense so far, except for one thing.  There&#8217;s one big question, and I hope you&#8217;re asking it.  Namely:
</p>
<p>
Why do the trade winds blow <i>west</i>?
</p>
<p>
If I don&#8217;t answer this, my story so far would work just as well if I switched the words &quot;west&quot; and &quot;east&quot;.   That wouldn&#8217;t necessarily mean my story was <i>wrong</i>.  It might just mean that there were two equally good options: a La Ni&ntilde;a phase where the trade winds blow west, and another phase &mdash; say, El Ni&ntilde;o &mdash; where they blow east!  From everything I&#8217;ve said so far, the world could be permanently stuck in one of these phases.  Or, maybe it could randomly flip between these two phases for some reason.
</p>
<p>
Something roughly like this last choice is actually true.  But it&#8217;s not so simple: there&#8217;s not a complete symmetry between west and east.
</p>
<p>
Why not?  Mainly because the Earth is turning to the <i>east</i>.
</p>
<p>
Air near the equator warms up and rises, so new air from more northern or southern regions moves in to take its place.  But because the Earth is fatter at the equator, the equator is moving faster to the east.  So, the new air from other places is moving less quickly by comparison&#8230; so as seen by someone standing on the equator, it blows <i>west</i>.   This is an example of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_effect">Coriolis effect</a>:

By the way: in case this stuff wasn&#8217;t tricky enough already, a wind that blows to the west is called an <i>easterly</i>, because it blows <i>from</i> the east!  That&#8217;s what happens when you put sailors in charge of scientific terminology.  So the westward-blowing trade winds are called &quot;northeasterly trades&quot; and &quot;southeasterly trades&quot; in the picture above.  But don&#8217;t let that confuse you.
</p>
<p>
(I also tend to think of Asia as the &quot;Far East&quot; and California as the &quot;West Coast&quot;, so I always need to keep reminding myself that Asia is in the west Pacific, while California is in the east Pacific.  But don&#8217;t let that confuse you either!  Just repeat after me until it makes perfect sense: &quot;The easterlies blow west from West Coast to Far East&quot;.)</p>
<p>
Okay: silly terminology aside, I hope everything makes perfect sense so far.  The trade winds have a good intrinsic reason to blow west, but in the La Ni&ntilde;a phase they&#8217;re also part of a feedback loop where they make the western Pacific warmer&#8230; which in turn <i>helps</i> the trade winds blow west.
</p>
<p>
But then comes an El Ni&ntilde;o!  Now for some reason the westward winds weaken.  This lets the built-up warm water in the western Pacific slosh back east.  And with weaker westward winds, less cold water is pulled up to the surface in the east.  So, the eastern Pacific warms up.  This makes for more clouds and rain in the eastern Pacific &mdash; that&#8217;s when we get floods in Southern California.  And with the ocean warmer in the eastern Pacific, hot air rises there, which tends to counteract the westward winds even more!
</p>
<p>
In other words, all the feedbacks reverse themselves.
</p>
<p>
But note: the trade winds never <i>mainly</i> blow east.  During an El Ni&ntilde;o they still blow west, just a bit <i>less</i>.  So, the climate is not flip-flopping between two symmetrical alternatives.  It&#8217;s flip-flopping between two <i>asymmetrical</i> alternatives.
</p>
<p>
I hope all this makes sense&#8230; except for one thing.  There&#8217;s another big question, and I hope you&#8217;re asking it.  Namely:
</p>
<p>
<i>Why</i> do the westward trade winds weaken?
</p>
<p>
We could also ask the same question about the start of the La Ni&ntilde;a phase: why do the westward trade winds get stronger?
</p>
<p>
The short answer is that nobody knows.  Or at least there&#8217;s no <i>one story</i> that everyone agrees on.  There are actually several stories&#8230; and perhaps more than one of them is true.  But now let me just show you the data:</p>
<p>
</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/ensocycle/soi.shtml"><br />
<img border="none" width="450" src="http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/ensocycle/soi_nino34.gif" /><br />
</a>
</div>
</p>
<p>
The top graph shows variations in the water temperature of the tropical Eastern Pacific ocean.  When it&#8217;s hot we have El Ni&ntilde;os: those are the red hills in the top graph.  The blue valleys are La Ni&ntilde;as.  Note that it&#8217;s possible to have two El Ni&ntilde;os in a row without an intervening La Ni&ntilde;a, or vice versa!
</p>
<p>
The bottom graph shows the &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni%C3%B1o-Southern_Oscillation#Southern_Oscillation">Southern Oscillation Index</a>&quot; or &quot;SOI&quot;.  This is the air pressure in Tahiti minus the air pressure in Darwin, Australia.  You can see those locations here:</p>
<p>
</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://www.bom.gov.au/watl/about-weather-and-climate/australian-climate-influences.shtml?bookmark=enso"><br />
<img border="none" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ENSO_animation_australian_bureau_of_meteorology.gif" /><br />
</a>
</div>
</p>
<p>
So, when the SOI is high, the air pressure is higher in the east Pacific than in the west Pacific.  This is what we expect in an La Ni&ntilde;a: that&#8217;s why the westward trade winds are strong then!  Conversely, the SOI is low in the El Ni&ntilde;o phase.  This variation in the SOI is called the Southern Oscillation.</p>
<p>
If you look at the graphs above, you&#8217;ll see how one looks almost like an upside-down version of the other.  So, El Ni&ntilde;o/La Ni&ntilde;a cycle is tightly linked to the Southern Oscillation.
</p>
<p>
Another thing you&#8217;ll see from is that ENSO cycle is far from perfectly periodic!  Here&#8217;s a graph of the Southern Oscillation Index going back a lot further:

</a>

</p>
<p>
This graph was made by William Kessler.  His explanations of the ENSO cycle are the first ones I really understood:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
William Kessler, <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/kessler/occasionally-asked-questions.html#q1">What is El Ni&ntilde;o and how does it relate to the usual situation in the tropical Pacific?</a>
</li>
<p />
<p><li>
William Kessler, <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/kessler/TALKS/ENSO-AMSteachers2.pdf">El Ni&ntilde;o: How it works, how we observe it</a>.
</li>
</p>
</ul>
<p>
My own explanation here is a slow-motion, watered-down version of his.  Any mistakes are, of course, mine.  To conclude, I want to quote his discussion of theories about why an El Ni&ntilde;o starts, and why it ends.  As you&#8217;ll see, this part is a bit more technical.  It involves three concepts I haven&#8217;t explained yet:</p>
<ul>
<li>
The &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermocline">thermocline</a>&quot; is the border between the warmer surface water in the ocean and the cold deep water, 100 to 200 meters below the surface.  During the La Ni&ntilde;a phase, warm water is blown to the western Pacific, and cold water is pulled up to the surface of the eastern Pacific.  So, the thermocline is deeper in the west than the east:</p>
<p><div align="center">

<img width="350" src="https://i1.wp.com/earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/ElNino/Images/sst_depth_1-97.jpg" /><br />
</a>
</div>
</p>
<p>When an El Ni&ntilde;o occurs, the thermocline flattens out:</p>
<p><div align="center">

</a>
</div>
</p>
<p><li>
&quot;<a href="http://www.coas.oregonstate.edu/research/po/research/rossby_waves/chelton.html">Oceanic Rossby waves</a>&quot; are very low-frequency waves in the ocean&#8217;s surface and thermocline.   At the ocean&#8217;s surface they are only 5 centimeters high, but hundreds of kilometers across.  They move at about 10 centimeters/second, requiring months to years to cross the ocean!  The surface waves are mirrored by waves in the thermocline, which are much larger, 10-50 meters in height. When the surface goes up, the thermocline goes down.
</li>
</p>
<p><li>
The &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden-Julian_oscillation">Madden-Julian Oscillation</a>&quot; or &quot;MJO&quot; is the largest form of variability in the tropical atmosphere on time scales of 30-90 days.  It&#8217;s a pulse that moves east across the Indian Ocean and Pacific ocean at 4-8 meters/second.  It manifests itself as patches of anomalously <i>high</i> rainfall and also anomalously <i>low</i> rainfall.  Strong Madden-Julian Oscillations are often seen 6-12 months before an El Ni&ntilde;o starts.
</li>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With this bit of background, let&#8217;s read what Kessler wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
There are two main theories at present. The first is that the event is initiated by the reflection from the western boundary of the Pacific of an oceanic Rossby wave (type of low-frequency planetary wave that moves only west). The reflected wave is supposed to lower the thermocline in the west-central Pacific and thereby warm the SST [sea surface temperature] by reducing the efficiency of upwelling to cool the surface. Then that makes winds blow towards the (slightly) warmer water and really start the event. The nice part about this theory is that the Rossby waves can be observed for months before the reflection, which implies that El Ni&ntilde;o is predictable.</p>
<p>The other idea is that the trigger is essentially random. The tropical convection (organized largescale thunderstorm activity) in the rising air tends to occur in bursts that last for about a month, and these bursts propagate out of the Indian Ocean (known as the Madden-Julian Oscillation). Since the storms are geostrophic (rotating according to the turning of the earth, which means they rotate clockwise in the southern hemisphere and counter-clockwise in the north), storm winds on the equator always blow towards the east. If the storms are strong enough, or last long enough, then those eastward winds may be enought to start the sloshing. But specific Madden-Julian Oscillation events are not predictable much in advance (just as specific weather events are not predictable in advance), and so to the extent that this is the main element, then El Ni&ntilde;o will not be predictable.</p>
<p>In my opinion both these two processes can be important in different El Ni&ntilde;os. Some models that did not have the MJO storms were successful in predicting the events of 1986-87 and 1991-92. That suggests that the Rossby wave part was a main influence at that time. But those same models have failed to predict the events since then, and the westerlies have appeared to come from nowhere. It is also quite possible that these two general sets of ideas are incomplete, and that there are other causes entirely. The fact that we have very intermittent skill at predicting the major turns of the ENSO cycle (as opposed to the very good forecasts that can be made once an event has begun) suggests that there remain important elements that are await explanation.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Next time I&#8217;ll talk a bit about mathematical models of the ENSO and another climate cycle &mdash; but please keep in mind that these cycles are still far from fully understood!</p>

				<h2><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/12/12/cancun/" rel="bookmark">Canc&uacute;n</a></h2>
				<small>12 December, 2010</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>What happened at the <a href="http://unfccc.int/2860.php">United Nations Climate Change Conference</a> in Canc&uacute;n this year?   I&#8217;m trying to figure that out, and I could use your help.</p>
<p>But if you&#8217;re just as confused as I am, this is an easy place to start:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.npr.org/2010/12/11/131988675/Climate-Talks-Wrap-With-Hope-For-Developing-Nations">Climate talks wrap with hope for developing nations</a>, <i>Weekend Edition Saturday</i>, National Public Radio.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve learned so far.</p>
<p>The good news is, first, that the negotiations didn&#8217;t completely collapse.  That was a real fear.</p>
<p>Second, 190 countries agreed to start a Green Climate Fund to raise and disburse $100 billion per year to help developing countries deal with climate change&#8230; starting in 2020.  </p>
<p>A good idea, but maybe too late.  <a href="http://beta.worldbank.org/content/adaptation-costs-global-estimate">The World Bank estimates</a> that the cost of adapting to a world that&#8217;s 2 &deg;C warmer by 2050 will be about $75-100 billion per year.    <a href="http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/">The International Energy Agency estimates</a> that the cost of supporting clean energy technology in developing countries is $110 billion per year if we&#8217;re going to keep the temperature rise below 2 &deg;C.  But these organizations say we need to start <i>now</i>, not a decade from now!  </p>
<p>And how to raise the money?  The Prime Minister of Norway, Jens Stoltenberg, leads the UN committee that&#8217;s supposed to answer this question.  He <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11954266">told the BBC</a> that the best approach would be a price on carbon that begins to reflect the damage it does:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carbon pricing has a double climate effect &mdash; it&#8217;s a huge source for revenue, but also gives the right incentives for reducing emissions by making it expensive to pollute.  The more ambitious we are, the higher the price will be &#8211; so there&#8217;s a very close link between the ceiling we set for emissions and the price.  We estimate that we need a price of about $20/25 per tonne to mobilise the $100bn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Third, our leaders made some steps towards saving the world&#8217;s forests.  Every year, forests equal to the area of England get cut down.  T This has got to stop, for all sorts of reasons.  For one thing, it causes 20% of the world&#8217;s greenhouse gas emissions &mdash; about the same as transportation worldwide!  </p>
<p>Cancun set up a framework called REDD+, which stands for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degrading Emissions, with the cute little + standing for broader ecosystem conservation.  This is supposed to create incentives to keep forests standing.  But there&#8217;s <a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/mexico/101210/redd-deforestation-climate-change-conference-cancun">a lot of work left</a>.  For example, while a $4.1 billion start-up fund is already in place, there&#8217;s no long-term plan for financing REDD+ yet.</p>
<p>The bad news?  Well, the main bad news is that there&#8217;s still a gap between what countries have pledged to do to reduce carbon emissions, and what they&#8217;d need to do to keep the expected rise in temperature below 2 &deg;C &mdash; or if you want a clearer goal, keeping CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations below 450 parts per million.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not as bad as you might think&#8230; at least if you believe this chart put out by the <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2010/12/so_close.html">Center for American Progress</a>.  They say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We found that even prior to the Copenhagen climate summit, if all parties did everything they claimed they would do at the time, the world was <b>only five gigatons of annual emissions shy</b> of the estimated 17 gigatons of carbon dioxide or CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent annual reductions needed to put us on a reasonable 2°C pathway. Since three gigatons of the projected reductions came from the economic downturn and improved projections on deforestation and peat emissions, the actual pledges of countries for additional reductions were slightly less than two-thirds of what was needed. But they were still not sufficient for the 2°C target.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and then:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After the Copenhagen Accord was finalized at the December 2009 climate summit, a January 2010 deadline was established for countries to submit pledges for actions by 2020 consistent with the accord’s 2°C goal. Two breakdowns of the pledges in February, and later in March, by Project Catalyst estimated that the five-gigaton gap had shrunk somewhat and more pledges had come in from developing countries. Part of the reason that pledges increased from developing countries was that the Copenhagen Accord had finally made a significant step forward on establishing a system of cooperation between developed and developing countries that had a chance at providing incentives for additional reductions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And now, they say, the gap is down to 4 gigatons per year.  This chart details it&#8230; click to make it bigger:</p>

</a>
</div>
<p>That 4-gigaton gap doesn&#8217;t sound so bad.  But of course, this estimate assumes that <i>pledges</i> translate into <i>reality!</i></p>
<p>So, the fingernail-biting saga of our planet continues&#8230;</p>

<p>
<b>JB</b>: I hear you are starting to build a climate science research group at Oxford.  What led you to this point?   What are your goals?
</p>
<p>
<b>TP</b>: I started my research career at Oxford University, doing a PhD in general relativity theory under the cosmologist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_William_Sciama">Dennis Sciama</a> (himself a student of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dirac">Paul Dirac</a>). Then I switched gear and have spent most of my career working on the dynamics and predictability of weather and climate, mostly working in national and international meteorological and climatological institutes. Now I&#8217;m back in Oxford as a Royal Society Research Professor in climate physics. Oxford has a lot of climate-related activities going on, both in basic science and in impact and policy issues. I want to develop activities in climate physics. Oxford has wonderful Physics and Mathematics Departments and I am keen to try to exploit human resources from these areas where possible.
</p>
<p>
The general area which interests me is in the area of uncertainty in climate prediction; finding ways to estimate uncertainty reliably and, of course, to reduce uncertainty. Over the years I have helped develop new techniques to predict uncertainty in weather forecasts. Because climate is a nonlinear system, the growth of initial uncertainty is flow dependent. Some days when the system is in a relatively stable part of state space, accurate weather predictions can be made a week or more ahead of time. In other more unstable situations, predictability is limited to a couple of days. Ensemble weather forecast techniques help estimate such flow dependent predictability, and this has enormous practical relevance.
</p>
<p>
How to estimate uncertainty in climate predictions is much more tricky than for weather prediction. There is, of course, the human element: how much we reduce greenhouse gas emissions will impact on future climate. But leaving this aside, there is the difficult issue of how to estimate the accuracy of the underlying computer models we use to predict climate.
</p>
<p>
To say a bit more about this, the problem is to do with how well climate models simulate the natural processes which amplify the anthropogenic increases in greenhouse gases (notably carbon dioxide). A key aspect of this amplification process is associated with the role of water in climate. For example, water vapour is itself a powerful greenhouse gas. If we were to assume that the relative humidity of the atmosphere (the percentage of the amount of water vapour at which the air would be saturated) was constant as the atmosphere warms under anthropogenic climate change, then humidity would amplify the climate change by a factor of two or more. On top of this, clouds &mdash; i.e. water in its liquid rather than gaseous form &mdash; have the potential to further amplify climate change (or indeed decrease it depending on the type or structure of the clouds). Finally, water in its solid phase can also be a significant amplifier of climate change. For example, sea ice reflects sunlight back to space. However as sea ice melts, e.g. in the Arctic, the underlying water absorbs more of the sunlight than before, again amplifying the underlying climate change signal.
</p>
<p>
We can approach these problems in two ways. Firstly we can use simplified mathematical models in which plausible assumptions (like the constant relative humidity one) are made to make the mathematics tractable. Secondly, we can try to simulate climate <i>ab initio</i> using the basic laws of physics (here, mostly, but not exclusively, the laws of classical physics).  If we are to have confidence in climate predictions, this <i>ab initio</i> approach has to be pursued. However, unlike, say temperature in the atmosphere, water vapour and cloud liquid water have more of a fractal distribution, with both large and small scales. We cannot simulate accurately the small scales in a global climate model with fixed (say 100km) grid, and this, perhaps more than anything, is the source of uncertainty in climate predictions.
</p>
<p>
This is not just a theoretical problem (although there is some interesting mathematics involved, e.g. of multifractal distribution theory and so on). In the coming years, governments will be looking to spend billions on new infrastructure for society to adapt to climate change: more reservoirs, better flood defences, bigger storm sewers etc etc. It is obviously important that this money is spent wisely. Hence we need to have some quantitative and reliable estimate of certainty that in regions where more reservoirs are to be built, the climate really will get drier and so on.
</p>
<p>
There is another reason for developing quantitative methods for estimating uncertainty: climate geoengineering. If we spray aerosols in the stratosphere, or whiten clouds by spraying sea salt into them, we need to be sure we are not doing something terrible to our climate, like shutting off the monsoons, or decreasing rainfall over Amazonia (which might then make the rainforest a source of carbon for the atmosphere rather than a sink). Reliable estimates of uncertainty of regional impacts of geoengineering are going to be essential in the future.
</p>
<p>
My goals? To bring quantitative methods from physics and maths into climate decision making.  One area that particularly interests me is the application of nonlinear stochastic-dynamic techniques to represent unresolved scales of motion in the <i>ab initio</i> models.  If you are interested to learn more about this, please see this book:
</p>
<p>&bull; Tim Palmer and Paul Williams, editors, <i>Stochastic Physics and Climate Modelling</i>, Cambridge U. Press, Cambridge, 2010.</p>
<p>
<b>JB</b>:  Thanks!  I&#8217;ve been reading that book.  I&#8217;ll talk about it next time on This Week&#8217;s Finds.
</p>
<p>
Suppose you were advising a college student who wanted to do something that would really make a difference when it comes to the world&#8217;s environmental problems.  What would you tell them?
</p>
<p>
<b>TP</b>: Well although this sounds a bit of a cliché, it&#8217;s important first and foremost to enjoy and be excited by what you are doing. If you have a burning ambition to work on some area of science without apparent application or use, but feel guilty because it&#8217;s not helping to save the planet, then stop feeling guilty and get on with fulfilling your dreams. If you work in some difficult area of science and achieve something significant, then this will give you a feeling of confidence that is impossible to be taught. Feeling confident in one&#8217;s abilities will make any subsequent move into new areas of activity, perhaps related to the environment, that much easier. If you demonstrate that confidence at interview, moving fields, even late in life, won&#8217;t be so difficult.
</p>
<p>
In my own case, I did a PhD in general relativity theory, and having achieved this goal (after a bleak period in the middle where nothing much seemed to be working out), I did sort of think to myself: if I can add to the pool of knowledge in this, traditionally difficult area of theoretical physics, I can pretty much tackle anything in science. I realize that sounds rather arrogant, and of course life is never as easy as that in practice.
</p>
<p>
<b>JB</b>: What if you were advising a mathematician or physicist who was already well underway in their career?  I know lots of such people who would like to do something &quot;good for the planet&quot;, but feel that they&#8217;re already specialized in other areas, and find it hard to switch gears.  In fact I might as well admit it &mdash; I&#8217;m such a person myself!
</p>
<p>
<b>TP</b>: Talk to the experts in the field. Face to face. As many as possible. Ask them how your expertise can be put to use. Get them to advise you on key meetings you should try to attend.
</p>
<p>
<b>JB</b>: Okay.  You&#8217;re an expert in the field, so I&#8217;ll start with you.  How can my expertise be put to use?  What are some meetings that I should try to attend?

<p>
<b>TP</b>: The <a href="http://www.agu.org/meetings/">American Geophysical Union</a> and the <a href="http://www.egu.eu/meetings/meeting-calendar.html">European Geophysical Union</a> have big multi-session conferences each year which include mathematicians with an interest in climate. On top of this, mathematical science institutes are increasingly holding meetings to engage mathematicians and climate scientists. For example, the <a>Isaac Newton Institute</a> at Cambridge University is holding a <a href="http://www.newton.ac.uk/programmes/CLP/">six-month programme on climate and mathematics</a>. I will be there for part of this programme. There have been similar programmes in the US and in Germany very recently.
</p>
<p>
Of course, as well as going to meetings, or perhaps before going to them, there is the small matter of some reading material. Can I strongly recommend the Working Group One report of the latest IPCC climate change assessments?  WG1 is tasked with summarizing the physical science underlying climate change. Start with the WG1 Summary for Policymakers from the Fourth Assessment Report:
</p>
<p>
&bull; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, <i>Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis</i>, <a href="http://www.ipcc-wg1.unibe.ch/publications/wg1-ar4/ar4-wg1-spm.pdf">Summary for Policymakers</a>.
</p>
<p>
and, if you are still interested, tackle the main WG1 report:
</p>
<p>
&bull; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, <i><a href="http://www.ipcc-wg1.unibe.ch/publications/wg1-ar4/wg1-ar4.html">Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis</a></i>, Cambridge U. Press, Cambridge, 2007.
</p>
<p>
There is a feeling that since the various so-called &quot;Climategate&quot; scandals, in which IPCC were implicated, climate scientists need to be more open about uncertainties in climate predictions and climate prediction models. But in truth, these uncertainties have always been openly discussed in the WG1 reports. These reports are absolutely not the alarmist documents many seem to think, and, I would say, give an extremely balanced picture of the science.  The latest report dates from 2007.
</p>
<p>
<b>JB</b>: I&#8217;ve been slowly learning what&#8217;s in this report, thanks in part to Nathan Urban, whom I interviewed in previous issues of This Week&#8217;s Finds.  I&#8217;ll have to keep at it.

</p>
<p></p>
<p>
You told me that there&#8217;s a big difference between the &quot;butterfly effect&quot; in chaotic systems with a few degrees of freedom, such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_attractor">Lorenz attractor</a> shown above, and the &quot;real butterfly effect&quot; in systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom, like the  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier-stokes_equations">Navier-Stokes equations</a>, the basic equations describing fluid flow.  What&#8217;s the main difference?
</p>
<p>
<b>TP</b>: Everyone knows, or at least think they know, what the butterfly effect is: the exponential growth of small initial uncertainties in chaotic systems, like the Lorenz system, after whom the butterfly effect was named by James Gleick in his excellent popular book:
</p>
<p>
&bull; James Gleick, <i>Chaos: Making a New Science</i>, Penguin, London, 1998.
</p>
<p>But in truth, this is not the butterfly effect as Lorenz had meant it (I knew Ed Lorenz quite well).  If you think about it, the possible effect of a flap of a butterfly&#8217;s wings on the weather some days later, involves not only an increase in the amplitude of the uncertainty, but also the scale. If we think of a turbulent system like the atmosphere, comprising a continuum of scales, its evolution is described by partial differential equations, not a low order set of ordinary differential equations. Each scale can be thought of as having its own characteristic dominant <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyapunov_exponent">Lyapunov exponent</a>, and these scales interact nonlinearly.</p>
<p> If we want to estimate the time for a flap of a butterfly&#8217;s wings to influence a large scale weather system, we can imagine summing up all the Lyapunov timescales associated with all the scales from the small scales to the large scales. If this sum diverges, then very good, we can say it will take a very long time for a small scale error or uncertainty to influence a large-scale system. But alas, simple scaling arguments suggest that there may be situations (in 3 dimensional turbulence) where this sum converges. Normally, we thinking of convergence as a good thing, but in this case it means that the small scale uncertainty, no matter how small scale it is, can affect the accuracy of the large scale prediction&#8230; in finite time. This is quite different to the conventional butterfly effect in low order chaos, where arbitrarily long predictions can be made by reducing initial uncertainty to sufficiently small levels.
</p>
<p>
<b>JB</b>: What are the practical implications of this difference?
</p>
<p>
<b>TP</b>: Climate models are finite truncations of the underlying partial differential equations of climate. A crucial question is: how do solutions converge as the truncation gets better and better?  More practically, how many floating point operations per second (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOPS">flops</a>) does my computer need to have, in order that I can simulate the large-scale components of climate accurately. Teraflops, petaflops, exaflops? Is there an irreducible uncertainty in our ability to simulate climate no matter how many flops we have? Because of the &quot;real&quot; butterfly effect, we simply don&#8217;t know. This has real practical implications.
</p>
<p>
<b>JB</b>: Nobody has proved existence and uniqueness for solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations.  Indeed Clay Mathematics Institute is offering a <a href="http://www.claymath.org/millennium/Navier-Stokes_Equations/">million-dollar prize</a> for settling this question.  But meteorologists use these equations to predict the weather with some success.  To mathematicians that might seem a bit strange.  What do you think is going on here?
</p>
<p>
<b>TP</b>: Actually, for certain simplifications to the Navier-Stokes equations, such as making them hydrostatic (which damps acoustic waves) then existence and uniqueness can be proven. And for weather forecasting we can get away with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_equations">hydrostatic approximation</a> for most applications. But in general existence and uniqueness haven&#8217;t been proven. The &quot;real&quot; butterfly effect is linked to this. Well obviously the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change can&#8217;t wait for the mathematicians to solve this problem, but as I tried to suggest above, I don&#8217;t think the problem is just an arcane mathematical conundrum, but rather may help us understand better what is possible to predict about climate change and what not.
</p>
<p>
<b>JB</b>:  Of course, meteorologists are really using a cleverly discretized version of the Navier-Stokes equations to predict the weather. Something vaguely similar happens in quantum field theory: we can use &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_QCD">lattice QCD</a>&quot; to compute the mass of the proton to reasonable accuracy, but nobody knows for sure if QCD makes sense in the continuum.  Indeed, there&#8217;s another million-dollar Clay Prize <a href="http://www.claymath.org/millennium/Yang-Mills_Theory/">waiting for the person who can figure that out</a>.   Could it be that sometimes a discrete approximation to a continuum theory does a pretty good job even if the continuum theory fundamentally doesn&#8217;t make sense?
</p>
<p>
<b>TP</b>: There you are! Spend a few years working on the continuum limit of lattice QCD and you may end up advising government on the likelihood of unexpected consequences on regional climate arising from some geoengineering proposal! The idea that two so apparently different fields could have elements in common is something bureaucrats find it hard to get their heads round.  We at the sharp end in science need to find ways of making it easier for scientists to move fields (even on a temporary basis) should they want to.</p>
<p>This reminds me of a story. When I was finishing my PhD, my supervisor, Dennis Sciama announced one day that the process of Hawking radiation, from black holes, could be understood using the Principle of Maximum Entropy Production in non-equilibrium thermodynamics. I had never heard of this Principle before, no doubt a gap in my physics education. However, a couple of weeks later, I was talking to a colleague of a colleague who was a climatologist, and he was telling me about a recent paper that purported to show that many of the properties of our climate system could be deduced from the Principle of Maximum Entropy Production. That there might be such a link between black hole theory and climate physics, was one reason that I thought changing fields might not be so difficult after all.
</p>
<p>
<b>JB</b>: To what extent is the problem of predicting climate insulated from the problems of predicting weather?  I bet this is a hard question, but it seems important.  What do people know about this?
</p>
<p>
<b>TP</b>: John Von Neumann was an important figure in meteorology (as well, for example, as in quantum theory). He oversaw a project at Princeton just after the Second World War, to develop a numerical weather prediction model based on a discretised version of the Navier-Stokes equations. It was one of the early applications of digital computers. Some years later, the first long-term climate models were developed based on these weather prediction models. But then the two areas of work diverged. People doing climate modelling needed to represent lots of physical processes: the oceans, the cryosphere, the biosphere etc, whereas weather prediction tended to focus on getting better and better discretised representations of the Navier-Stokes equations.
</p>
<p>
One rationale for this separation was that weather forecasting is an initial value problem whereas climate is a &quot;forced&quot; problem (e.g. how does climate change with a specified increase in carbon dioxide?). Hence, for example, climate people didn’t need to agonise over getting ultra accurate estimates of the initial conditions for their climate forecasts.
</p>
<p>
But the two communities are converging again. We realise there are lots of synergies between short term weather prediction and climate prediction. Let me give you one very simple example. Whether anthropogenic climate change is going to be catastrophic to society, or is something we will be able to adapt to without too many major problems, we need to understand, as mentioned above, how clouds interact with increasing levels of carbon dioxide. Clouds cannot be represented explicitly in climate models because they occur on scales that can’t be resolved due to computational constraints. So they have to be represented by simplified &quot;parametrisations&quot;.  We can test these parametrisations in weather forecast models. To put it crudely (to be honest too crudely) if the cloud parametrisations (and corresponding representations of water vapour) are systematically wrong, then the forecasts of tomorrow’s daily maximum temperature will also be systematically wrong.</p>
<p>To give another example, I myself for a number of years have been developing stochastic methods to represent truncation uncertainty in weather prediction models. I am now trying to apply these methods in climate prediction. The ability to test the skill of these stochastic schemes in weather prediction mode is crucial to having confidence in them in climate prediction mode. There are lots of other examples of where a synergy between the two areas is important.
</p>
<p>
<b>JB</b>: When we met recently, you mentioned that there are currently no high-end supercomputers dedicated to climate issues.  That seems a bit odd.  What sort of resources are there?  And how computationally intensive are the simulations people are doing now?
</p>
<p>
<b>TP</b>: By &quot;high end&quot; I mean very high end: that is, machines in the petaflop range of performance. If one takes the view that climate change is one of the gravest threats to society, then throwing all the resources that science and technology allows, to try to quantify exactly how grave this threat really is, seems quite sensible to me. On top of that, if we are to spend billions (dollars, pounds, euros etc.) on new technology to adapt to climate change, we had better make sure we are spending the money wisely &mdash; no point building new reservoirs if climate change will make your region wetter. So the predictions that it will get drier in such a such a place better be right. Finally, if we are to ever take these geoengineering proposals seriously we’d better be sure we understand the regional consequences. We don’t want to end up shutting off the monsoons! Reliable climate predictions really are essential.
</p>
<p>
I would say that there is no more computationally complex problem in science than climate prediction. There are two key modes of instability in the atmosphere, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convective_instability">convective instabilites</a> (thunderstorms) with scales of kilometers and what are called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroclinity">baroclinic instabilities</a> (midlatitude weather systems) with scales of thousands of kilometers. Simulating these two instabilities, and their mutual global interactions, is beyond the capability of current global climate models because of computational constraints. On top of this, climate models try to represent not only the physics of climate (including the oceans and the cryosphere), but the chemistry and biology too. That introduces considerable computational complexity in addition to the complexity caused by the multi-scale nature of climate.
</p>
<p>
By and large individual countries don’t have the financial resources (or at least they claim they don’t!) to fund such high end machines dedicated to climate. And the current economic crisis is not helping! On top of which, for reasons discussed above in relation to the &quot;real&quot; butterfly effect, I can’t go to government and say: &quot;Give me a 100 petaflop machine and I will absolutely definitely be able to reduce uncertainty in forecasts climate change by a factor of 10&quot;. In my view, the way forward may be to think about internationally funded supercomputing. So, just as we have internationally funded infrastructure in particle physics, astronomy, so too in climate prediction. Why not?
</p>
<p>
Actually, very recently the NSF in the US gave a consortium of climate scientists from the US, Europe and Japan, a few months of dedicated time on a top-end Cray XT4 computer called <a href="http://www.cray.com/Assets/PDF/successstories/climateprediction.pdf">Athena</a>. Athena wasn’t quite in the petaflop range, but not too far off, and using this dedicated time,  we produced some fantastic results, otherwise unachievable, showing what the international community could achieve, given the computational resources. Results from the Athena project are currently being written up &mdash; they demonstrate what can be done where there is a will from the funding agencies.
</p>
<p>
<b>JB</b>: In a Guardian article on human-caused climate change you were quoted as saying &quot;There might be a 50% risk of widespread problems or possibly only 1%.  Frankly, I would have said a risk of 1% was sufficient for us to take the problem seriously enough to start thinking about reducing emissions.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to argue with that, but <i>starting to think</i> about reducing emissions is vastly less costly than actually reducing them.  What would you say to someone who replied, &quot;If the risk is possibly just 1%, it&#8217;s premature to take action &mdash; we need more research first&quot;?
</p>
<p>
<b>TP</b>: The implication of your question is that a 1% risk is just too small to worry about or do anything about. But suppose the next time you checked in to fly to Europe, and they said at the desk that there was a 1% chance that volcanic ash would cause the aircraft engines to fail mid flight, leading the plane to crash, killing all on board. Would you fly? I doubt it!</p>
<p>My real point is that in assessing whether emissions cuts are too expensive, given the uncertainty in climate predictions, we need to assess how much we value things like the Amazon rainforest, or of (preventing the destruction of) countries like Bangladesh or the African Sahel. If we estimate the damage caused by dangerous climate change &mdash; let’s say associated with a 4 &deg;C or greater global warming &mdash; to be at least 100 times the cost of taking mitigating action, then it is worth taking this action even if the probability of dangerous climate change was just 1%. But of course, according to the latest predictions, the probability of realizing such dangerous climate changes is much nearer 50%.  So in reality, it is worth cutting emissions if the value you place on current climate is comparable or greater than the cost of cutting emissions.
</p>
<p>
Summarising, there are two key points here. Firstly, rational decisions can be made in the light of uncertain scientific input. Secondly, whilst we do certainly need more research, that should not itself be used as a reason for inaction.</p>
<p>
Thanks, John, for allowing me the opportunity to express some views about climate physics on your web site.
</p>
<p>
<b>JB</b>: Thank you!
