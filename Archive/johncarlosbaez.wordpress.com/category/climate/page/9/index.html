					<p>We&#8217;re trying to get a little insight into the Earth&#8217;s glacial cycles, using very simple models.  We have a long way to go, but let&#8217;s review where we are.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/11/06/mathematics-and-the-environment-part-5/">Part 5</a> and <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/11/10/mathematics-and-the-environment-part-6/">Part 6</a>, we studied a model where the Earth can be <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bistability">bistable</a></b>.  In other words, if the parameters are set right it has two stable states: one where it&#8217;s cold and stays cold because it&#8217;s icy and reflects lots of sunlight, and another where it&#8217;s hot and stays hot because it&#8217;s dark and absorbs lots of sunlight.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/11/13/mathematics-of-the-environment-part-7/">Part 7</a> we saw a  bistable system being pushed around by noise and also an oscillating &#8216;force&#8217;.  When the parameters are set right, we see <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_resonance">stochastic resonance</a></b>: the noise amplifies the system&#8217;s response to the oscillations!   This is supposed to remind us of how the Milankovich cycles in the Earth&#8217;s orbit may get amplified to cause glacial cycles.  But this system was not based on any model of the Earth&#8217;s climate.</p>
<p>Now a student in this course has put the pieces together!   Try this program by Michael Knap and see what happens:</p>

<p>Remember, our simple model of the Earth&#8217;s climate amounted to this differential equation:</p>

This is a rough estimate of how much energy it takes to heat a square meter of a dry planet.  It does not include effects of oceans or atmospheric water vapor: it&#8217;s about half the heat capacity at constant pressure of the column of dry air over a square meter.</p>

Here we are imagining, just for fun, that we can turn up the brightness of the Sun for a while!</p>
<p>Or, you can choose <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q%28t%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Q(t)" class="latex" /> to be a sinusoidal function:</p>

This is better for understanding stochastic resonance.</p>
<p>&bull; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%28T%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c(T)" class="latex" /> is the average <b>coalbedo</b> of the Earth: that is, the fraction of solar power it absorbs.  We approximate this by:</p>

<p>Here <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_i+%3D+0.35&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c_i = 0.35" class="latex" /> is the <b>icy coalbedo</b>, good for very low temperatures when much of the Earth is light in color.  <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_f+%3D+0.7+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c_f = 0.7 " class="latex" /> is the <b>ice-free coalbedo</b>, good for high temperatures when the Earth is darker.  Finally, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;gamma" class="latex" /> is the <b>coalbedo transition rate</b>, which says how rapidly the coalbedo changes as the Earth&#8217;s temperature increases.</p>
<p>Now Michael Knap is adding noise, giving this equation:</p>

<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w%28t%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="w(t)" class="latex" /> is white noise and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csigma&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;sigma" class="latex" /> is another constant.  To look like professionals we can also write this using differentials instead of derivatives:</p>

<p>Play around with Michael&#8217;s model and see what effects you can get!</p>
<p><b>Puzzle.</b>  List some of the main reasons this model is not yet ready for realistic investigations of how the Milankovitch cycles cause glacial cycles.</p>
<p>You can think of some big reasons just knowing what I&#8217;ve told you already in this course.  But you&#8217;ll be able to think of some more once you know more about Milankovitch cycles.</p>
<h3> Milankovitch cycles </h3>
<p>We&#8217;ve been having fun with models, and we&#8217;ve been learning something from them, but now it&#8217;s time to go back and think harder about what&#8217;s really going on.</p>
<p>As I keep hinting, a lot of scientists believe that the Earth&#8217;s glacial cycles are related to cyclic changes in the Earth&#8217;s orbit and the tilt of its axis.  Since one of the first scientists to carefully study this issue was Milutin Milankovitch, these are called <b>Milankovitch cycles</b>.  Now let&#8217;s look at them in more detail.</p>
<p>The three major types of Milankovitch cycle are:</p>
<p>&bull; changes in the <b>eccentricity</b> of the Earth&#8217;s orbit &#8211; that is, how much the orbit deviates from being a circle:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_eccentricity"><br />

</a> <br />
(changes greatly exaggerated)
</div>
<p>&bull; changes in the <b>obliquity</b>, or tilt of the Earth&#8217;s axis:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt"><br />
<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Earth_obliquity_range.svg/250px-Earth_obliquity_range.svg.png" /><br />
</a>
</div>
<p>&bull; <b>precession</b>, meaning changes in the direction of the Earth&#8217;s axis relative to the fixed stars:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_precession_%28astronomy%29"><br />
<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Earth_precession.svg/250px-Earth_precession.svg.png" /><br />
</a>
</div>
<p>The first important thing to realize is this: it&#8217;s not obvious that Milankovitch cycles can cause glacial cycles.  During a glacial period, the Earth is about 5&deg;C cooler than it is now.  But the Milankovitch cycles barely affect the overall annual amount of solar radiation hitting the Earth!</p>
<p>This fact is clear for precession or changes in obliquity, since these just involve the tilt of the Earth&#8217;s axis, and the Earth is nearly a sphere.  The amount of Sun hitting a sphere doesn&#8217;t depend on how the sphere is &#8217;tilted&#8217;.</p>
<p>For changes in the eccentricity of the Earth&#8217;s orbit, this fact is a bit less obvious.  After all, when the orbit is more eccentric, the Earth gets <i>closer</i> to the Sun sometimes, but <i>farther</i> at other times.   So you need to actually sit down and do some math to figure out the net effect.  Luckily, Greg Egan did this calculation in a very nice way, <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/07/02/a-quantum-of-warmth/#comment-6569">earlier here on the Azimuth blog</a>.  I&#8217;ll show you his calculation at the end of this article.  It turns out that when the Earth&#8217;s orbit is at its most eccentric, it gets <i>very, very slightly</i> more energy from the Sun each year: 0.167% more than when its orbit is at its least eccentric.  This is not enough to warm the Earth very much.</p>
<p>So, there are interesting puzzles involved in the Milankovitch cycles.  They don&#8217;t affect the total amount of radiation that hits the Earth each year&#8212;not much, anyway&#8212;but they <i>do</i> cause substantial changes in the amount of radiation that hits the Earth at various different <i>latitudes</i> in various different <i>seasons</i>.  We need to understand what such changes might do.</p>
<p>James Croll was one of the first to think about this, back around 1875.  He decided that what really matters is the amount of sunlight hitting the far northern latitudes in <i>winter</i>.  When this was low, he claimed, glaciers would tend to form and an ice age would start.  But later, in the 1920s, Milankovitch made the opposite claim: what really matters is the amount of sunlight hitting the far northern latitudes in <i>summer</i>.  When <i>this</i> was low, an ice age would start.</p>
<p>If we take a quick look at the data, we see that the truth is not obvious:</p>

</div>
<p>I like this graph because it&#8217;s pretty&#8230;  but I wish the vertical axes were labelled.  We will see some more precise graphs in future weeks.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, this graph gives some idea of what&#8217;s going on.  Precession, obliquity and eccentricity vary in complex but still predictable ways.  From this you can compute the amount of solar energy that hits the surface of the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere on July 1st at a latitude of 65&deg; N.   That&#8217;s the yellow curve.    People believe this quantity has <i>some</i> relation to the Earth&#8217;s temperature, as shown by the black curve at bottom.  However, the relation is <i>far from clear!</i></p>
<p>Indeed, if you only look at this graph, you might easily decide that Milankovitch cycles are <i>not</i> important in causing glacial cycles.   But people have analyzed temperature proxies over long spans of time, and found evidence for cyclic changes at periods that match those of the Milankovitch cycles.   Here&#8217;s a classic paper on this subject:</p>
<p>&bull; J. D. Hays, J. Imbrie, and N. J. Shackleton, <a href="http://www.mantleplumes.org/WebDocuments/Hays1976.pdf">Variations in the earth&#8217;s orbit: pacemaker of the Ice Ages</a>, <i>Science</i> <b>194</b> (1976), 1121-1132.</p>
<p>They selected two sediment cores from the Indian ocean, which contain sediments deposited over the last 450,000 years.  They measured:</p>
<p>1) Ts, an estimate of summer sea-surface temperatures at the core site, derived from a statistical analysis of tiny organisms called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiolarian">radiolarians</a> found in the sediments.</p>
<p>2) &delta;<sup>18</sup>O, the excess of the heavy isotope of oxygen in tiny organisms called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foraminifera">foraminifera</a> also found in the sediments.</p>
<p>3) The percentage of radiolarians that are <i>Cycladophora davisiana</i>&#8212;a certain species not used in the estimation of Ts.</p>
<p>Identical samples were analyzed for the three variables at 10-centimeter intervals throughout each core.  Then they took a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform">Fourier transform</a> of this data to see at which frequencies these variables wiggle the most!  When we take the Fourier transform of a function and then square it, the result is called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_density">power spectrum</a>.  So, they actually graphed the power spectra for these three variables:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature/hays_imbrie_shackleton_spectra.jpg"><img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature/hays_imbrie_shackleton_spectra.jpg" alt="" /></a></div>
<p>The top graph shows the power spectra for Ts, &delta;<sup>18</sup>O, and the percentage of <i>Cycladophora davisiana</i>.  The second one shows the spectra after a bit of extra messing around.  Either way, there seem to be peaks at frequencies of 19, 23, 42 and <i>roughly</i> 100 thousand years.   However the last number is quite fuzzy: if you look, you&#8217;ll see the three different power spectra have peaks at 94, 106 and 122 thousand years.</p>
<p>So, some sort of cycles seem to be occurring.  This is far from the only piece of evidence, but it&#8217;s a famous one.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s go over the three major forms of Milankovitch cycle, and keep our eye out for cycles that take place every 19, 23, 42 or roughly 100 thousand years!</p>
<h3>Eccentricity</h3>
<p>The Earth&#8217;s orbit is an ellipse, and the <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_eccentricity">eccentricity</a></b> of this ellipse says how far it is from being circular.  But the eccentricity of the Earth&#8217;s orbit slowly changes: it varies from being nearly circular, with an eccentricity of 0.005, to being more strongly elliptical, with an eccentricity of 0.058.  The mean eccentricity is 0.028.  There are several periodic components to these variations.  The strongest occurs with a period of 413,000 years, and changes the eccentricity by ±0.012.  Two other components have periods of 95,000 and 123,000 years.</p>
<p>The eccentricity affects the percentage difference in incoming solar radiation between the <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perihelion">perihelion</a></b>, the point where the Earth is closest to the Sun, and the <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphelion">aphelion</a></b>, when it is farthest from the Sun.  This works as follows.  The percentage difference between the Earth&#8217;s distance from the Sun at perihelion and aphelion is twice the eccentricity, and the percentage change in incoming solar radiation is about twice that.  The first fact follows from the definition of eccentricity, while the second follows from differentiating the inverse-square relationship between brightness and distance.</p>
<p>Right now the eccentricity is 0.0167, or 1.67%.  Thus, the distance from the Earth to Sun varies 3.34% over the course of a year.  This in turn gives an annual variation in incoming solar radiation of about 6.68%.  Note that this is <i>not</i> the cause of the seasons: those arise due to the Earth&#8217;s tilt, and occur at different times in the northern and southern hemispheres.</p>
<h3>Obliquity</h3>
<p>The angle of the Earth&#8217;s axial tilt with respect to the plane of its orbit, called the <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt">obliquity</a></b>, varies between 22.1° and 24.5° in a roughly periodic way, with a period of 41,000 years.  When the obliquity is high, the strength of seasonal variations is stronger.</p>
<p>Right now the obliquity is 23.44°, roughly halfway between its extreme values.  It is decreasing, and will reach its minimum value around the year 10,000 CE.</p>
<h4> Precession</h4>
<p>The slow turning in the direction of the Earth&#8217;s axis of rotation relative to the fixed stars, called <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_precession_%28astronomy%29">precession</a></b>, has a period of roughly 23,000 years.   As precession occurs, the seasons drift in and out of phase with the perihelion and aphelion of the Earth&#8217;s orbit.</p>
<p>Right now the perihelion occurs during the southern hemisphere&#8217;s summer, while the aphelion is reached during the southern winter.  This tends to make the southern hemisphere seasons more extreme than the northern hemisphere seasons.</p>
<p>The gradual precession of the Earth is <i>not</i> due to the same physical mechanism as the wobbling of the top.  That sort of wobbling <i>does</i> occur, but it has a period of only 427 days.  The 23,000-year precession is due to tidal interactions between the Earth, Sun and Moon.  For details, see:</p>
<p>&bull; John Baez, <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/wobble/">The wobbling of the Earth and other curiosities</a>.</p>
<p>In the real world, most things get more complicated the more carefully you look at them.  For example, precession actually has several periodic components.  According to <a href="http://www2.academieroyale.be/academie/documents/BergerCV2008746.pdf">Andr&eacute; Berger</a>, a top expert on changes in the Earth&#8217;s orbit, the four biggest components have these periods:</p>
<p>&bull; 23,700 years</p>
<p>&bull; 22,400 years</p>
<p>&bull; 18,980 years</p>
<p>&bull; 19,160 years</p>
<p>in order of decreasing strength.  But in geology, these tend to show up either as a single peak around the mean value of 21,000 years, or two peaks at frequencies of 23,000 and 19,000 years.</p>
<p>To add to the fun, the three effects I&#8217;ve listed&mdash;changes in eccentricity, changes in obliquity, and precession&mdash;are not independent.  According to Berger, cycles in eccentricity arise from &#8216;beats&#8217; between different precession cycles:</p>
<p>&bull; The 95,000-year eccentricity cycle arises from a beat between the 23,700-year and 19,000-year precession cycles.</p>
<p>&bull; The 123,000-year eccentricity cycle arises from a beat between the 22,4000-year and 18,000-year precession cycles.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to delve into all this stuff more deeply someday, but I haven&#8217;t had time yet.  For now, let me just refer you to this classic review paper:</p>
<p>&bull; Andr&eacute; Berger, Pleistocene climatic variability at astronomical frequencies, <i><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/1040618289900165">Quaternary International</a></i> <b>2</b> (1989), 1-14.</p>
<p>Later, as I get up to speed, I&#8217;ll talk about more modern work.</p>
<h3> Paleontology versus astronomy </h3>
<p>Now we can compare the data from ocean sediments to the Milankovitch cycles as computed in astronomy:</p>
<p>&bull; The roughly 19,000-year cycle in ocean sediments may come from 18,980-year and 19,160-year <i>precession</i> cycles.</p>
<p>&bull; The roughly 23,000-year cycle in ocean sediments may come from 23,700-year <i>precession</i> cycle.</p>
<p>&bull; The roughly 42,000-year cycle in ocean sediments may come from the 41,000-year <i>obliquity</i> cycle.</p>
<p>&bull; The roughly 100,000-year cycle in ocean sediments may come from the 95,000-year and 123,000-year <i>eccentricity</i> cycles.</p>
<p>Again, the last one looks the most fuzzy.  As we saw, different kinds of sediments seem to indicate cycles of 94, 106 and 122 thousand years.  At least two of these periods match eccentricity cycles fairly well.  But a detailed analysis would be required to distinguish between real effects and coincidences in this subject!  Such analyses have been done, of course.  But until I study them more, I won&#8217;t try to discuss them.</p>

					<p><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/11/10/mathematics-and-the-environment-part-6/">Last time</a> we saw how the ice albedo effect could, in theory, make the Earth&#8217;s climate have two stable states.  In a very simple model, we saw that a hot Earth might stay hot since it&#8217;s dark and absorbs lots of sunlight, while a cold Earth might stay cold&#8212;since it&#8217;s icy and white and reflects most of the sunlight.  </p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t tried it yet, make sure to play around with this program pioneered by Lesley de Cruz and then implemented in Java by Allan Erskine:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/coalbedo/temperature.html">Temperature dynamics</a>.</p>
<p>The explanations were all given in <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/11/10/mathematics-and-the-environment-part-6/">Part 6</a> so I won&#8217;t repeat them here!   </p>
<p>This week, we&#8217;ll see how <i>noise</i> affects this simple climate model.   We&#8217;ll borrow lots of material from here:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Glyn+Adgie">Glyn Adgie</a> and <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Tim+van+Beek">Tim van Beek</a>, <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/07/30/increasing-the-signal-to-noise-ratio-with-more-noise/">Increasing the signal-to-noise ratio with more noise</a>.   </p>
<p>And we&#8217;ll use software written by these guys together with Allan Erskine.  The power of the Azimuth Project knows no bounds!</p>
<h3> Stochastic differential equations</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Milankovitch+cycle#Idea">Milankovich cycles</a> are periodic changes in how the Earth orbits the Sun.  One question is: can these changes can be responsible for the ice ages?  On the first sight it seems impossible, because the changes are simply too small. But it turns out that we can find a dynamical system where a small periodic external force is actually strengthened by random &#8216;noise&#8217; in the system. This phenomenon has been dubbed &#8216;stochastic resonance&#8217; and has been proposed as an explanation for the ice ages.  It also shows up in many other phenomena:</p>
<p>&bull; Roberto Benzi, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/nlin/0702008">Stochastic resonance: from climate to biology</a>.</p>
<p>But to understand it, we need to think a little about stochastic differential equations.</p>
<p>A lot of systems can be described by ordinary differential equations:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7Bd+x%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D+f%28x%2C+t%29%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{d x}{d t} = f(x, t)} " class="latex" /> </p>
<p>If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" /> is nice, the time evolution of the system will be a nice smooth function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%28t%29%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x(t)," class="latex" /> like the trajectory of a thrown stone. But there are situations where we have some kind of noise, a chaotic, fluctuating influence, that we would like to take into account. This could be, for example, turbulence in the air flow around a rocket. Or, in our case, short term fluctuations of the weather of the earth. If we take this into account, we get an equation of the form</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7Bd+x%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D+f%28x%2C+t%29+%2B+w%28t%29+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{d x}{d t} = f(x, t) + w(t) } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>where the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="w" class="latex" /> is a &#8216;random function&#8217; which models the noise.  Typically this noise is just a simplified way to take into account rapidly changing fine-grained aspects of the system at hand. This way we do not have to explicitly model these aspects, which is often impossible.   </p>
<h3> White noise </h3>
<p>We&#8217;ll look at a model of this sort:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7Bd+x%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D+f%28x%2C+t%29+%2B+w%28t%29+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{d x}{d t} = f(x, t) + w(t) } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w%28t%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="w(t)" class="latex" /> is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise">&#8216;white noise&#8217;</a>.  But what&#8217;s that?  </p>
<p>Very naively speaking, white noise is a random function that typically looks very wild, like this:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/White-noise.png/450px-White-noise.png" /></a></div>
<p>White noise actually has a sound, too: it sounds like <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/Whitenoisesound.ogg">this</a>! The idea is that you can take a random function like the one graphed above, and use it to drive the speakers of your computer, to produce sound waves of an equally wild sort.  And it sounds like static.</p>
<p>However, all this is naive.  Why?   The concept of a &#8216;random function&#8217; is not terribly hard to define, at least if you&#8217;ve taken the usual year-long course on real analysis that we force on our grad students at U.C. Riverside: it&#8217;s a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_measure">probability measure</a> on some space of functions.   But white noise is a bit too spiky and singular too be a random function: it&#8217;s a random <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_%28mathematics%29">distribution</a>.  </p>
<p>Distributions were envisioned by Dirac but formalized later by Laurent Schwarz and others.  A distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D%28t%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="D(t)" class="latex" /> is a bit like a function, but often distributions are too nasty to have well-defined values at points!   Instead, all that makes sense are expressions like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cint_%5Cinfty%5E%5Cinfty+D%28t%29+f%28t%29+%5C%2C+d+t%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;int_&#92;infty^&#92;infty D(t) f(t) &#92;, d t} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>where we multiply the distribution by any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_support#Compact_support">compactly supported</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_function">smooth function</a> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28t%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f(t)" class="latex" /> and then integrate it.  Indeed, we specify a distribution just by saying what all these integrals equal.  For example, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_delta_function">Dirac delta</a> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta%28t%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;delta(t)" class="latex" /> is a distribution defined by</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cint_%5Cinfty%5E%5Cinfty+%5Cdelta%28t%29+f%28t%29+%5C%2C+d+t+%3D+f%280%29+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;int_&#92;infty^&#92;infty &#92;delta(t) f(t) &#92;, d t = f(0) }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>If you try to imagine the Dirac delta as a function, you run into a paradox: it should be zero everywhere except at <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t+%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="t = 0" class="latex" />, but its integral should equal 1.  So, if you try to graph it, the region under the graph should be an infinitely skinny infinitely tall spike whose area is 1:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_delta_function"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Dirac_distribution_PDF.svg/300px-Dirac_distribution_PDF.svg.png" /></a></div>
<p>But that&#8217;s impossible, at least in the standard framework of mathematics&#8212;so such a function does not really exist!  </p>
<p>Similarly, white noise <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w%28t%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="w(t)" class="latex" /> is too spiky to be an honest random function, but if we multiply it by any compactly supported smooth function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28t%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f(t)" class="latex" /> and integrate, we get a random variable</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cint_%5Cinfty%5E%5Cinfty+w%28t%29+f%28t%29+%5C%2C+d+t+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;int_&#92;infty^&#92;infty w(t) f(t) &#92;, d t }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>whose probability distribution is a Gaussian with mean zero and standard deviation equal to</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Csqrt%7B+%5Cint_%5Cinfty%5E%5Cinfty+f%28t%29%5E2+%5C%2C+d+t%7D+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;sqrt{ &#92;int_&#92;infty^&#92;infty f(t)^2 &#92;, d t} } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>(Note: the word &#8216;distribution&#8217; has a completely different meaning when it shows up in the phrase <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function">probability distribution</a>!  I&#8217;m assuming you&#8217;re comfortable with <i>that</i> meaning already.)</p>
<p>Indeed, the above formulas make sense and are true, not just when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" /> is compactly supported and smooth, but whenever </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Csqrt%7B+%5Cint_%5Cinfty%5E%5Cinfty+f%28t%29%5E2+%5C%2C+d+t%7D+%7D+%3C+%5Cinfty+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;sqrt{ &#92;int_&#92;infty^&#92;infty f(t)^2 &#92;, d t} } &lt; &#92;infty " class="latex" /></p>
<p>If you know about Gaussians and you know about this sort of integral, which shows up all over math and physics, you&#8217;ll realize that white noise is an extremely natural concept!</p>
<h3> Brownian motion </h3>
<p>While white noise is not a random function, its integral</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+W%28s%29+%3D+%5Cint_0%5Es+w%28s%29+%5C%2C+ds+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ W(s) = &#92;int_0^s w(s) &#92;, ds } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>turns out to be a well-defined random function.  It has a lot of names, including: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_process">Wiener process</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion">Brownian motion</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_noise">red noise</a> and&#8212;as a kind of off-color joke&#8212;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colors_of_noise#Brown.28ian.29_noise">brown noise</a>.  </p>
<p>The capital W here stands for Wiener: that is, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener">Norbert Wiener</a>, the <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/article/424363/the-original-absent-minded-professor/">famously absent-minded</a> MIT professor who studied this random function&#8230; and also invented <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics">cybernetics</a>:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://cyberneticzoo.com/?tag=norbert-wiener"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/cyberneticzoo.com/wp-content/uploads/Wiener_May1949.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>Brownian noise sounds like <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Brown_noise.ogg">this</a>. </p>
<p><b>Puzzle:</b>  How does it sound different from white noise, and why?</p>
<p>It looks like this:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_process#Brownian_scaling"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/Wiener_process_animated.gif" /></a>
</div>
<p>Here we are zooming in on closer and closer, while rescaling the vertical axis as well.  We see that Brownian noise is self-similar: if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W%28t%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="W(t)" class="latex" /> is Brownian noise, so is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W%28c+t%29%2F%5Csqrt%7Bc%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="W(c t)/&#92;sqrt{c}" class="latex" /> for all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+%3E+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c &gt; 0" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>More importantly for us, Brownian noise is the solution of this differential equation:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7Bd+W%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D+w%28t%29+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{d W}{d t} = w(t) } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w%28t%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="w(t)" class="latex" /> is white noise.  This is essentially true by definition, but making it rigorous takes some work.  More fancy stochastic differential equations </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7Bd+x%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D+f%28x%2C+t%29+%2B+w%28t%29+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{d x}{d t} = f(x, t) + w(t) } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>take even more work to rigorously formulate and solve.  You can read about them here:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Stochastic+differential+equation">Stochastic differential equation</a>, Azimuth Library.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s actually much easier to explain the <i>difference equations</i> we use to <i>approximately</i> solve these stochastic differential equation on the computer.  Suppose we discretize time into steps like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t_i+%3D+i+%5CDelta+t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="t_i = i &#92;Delta t" class="latex" /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CDelta+t+%3E+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;Delta t &gt; 0" class="latex" /> is some fixed number, our &#8216;time step&#8217;.  Then we can define</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%28t_%7Bi%2B1%7D%29+%3D+x%28t_i%29+%2B+f%28x%28t_i%29%2C+t_i%29+%5C%3B+%5CDelta+t+%2B+w_i+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x(t_{i+1}) = x(t_i) + f(x(t_i), t_i) &#92;; &#92;Delta t + w_i " class="latex" /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="w_i" class="latex" /> are independent Gaussian random variables with mean zero and standard deviation </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B+%5CDelta+t%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;sqrt{ &#92;Delta t}" class="latex" /></p>
<p>The square root in this formula comes from the definition I gave of white noise.</p>
<p>If we use a random number generator to crank out random numbers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="w_i" class="latex" /> distributed in this way, we can write a program to work out the numbers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%28t_i%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x(t_i)" class="latex" /> if we are given some initial value <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%280%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x(0)" class="latex" />.  And if the time step <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CDelta+t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;Delta t" class="latex" /> is small enough, we can hope to get a &#8216;good approximation to the true solution&#8217;.  Of course defining what we mean by a &#8216;good approximation&#8217; is tricky here&#8230; but I think it&#8217;s more important to just plunge in and see what happens, to get a feel for what&#8217;s going on here.</p>
<h3> Stochastic resonance </h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s do an example of this equation:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7Bd+x%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D+f%28x%2C+t%29+%2B+w%28t%29+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{d x}{d t} = f(x, t) + w(t) } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>which exhibits &#8216;stochastic resonance&#8217;.  Namely:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7Bd+x%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D+x%28t%29+-+x%28t%29%5E3+%2B+A+%5C%3B++%5Csin%28t%29++%2B+%5Csqrt%7B2D%7D+w%28t%29+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{d x}{d t} = x(t) - x(t)^3 + A &#92;;  &#92;sin(t)  + &#92;sqrt{2D} w(t) } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Here <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="D" class="latex" /> are constants we get to choose.  If we set them both to zero we get:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7Bd+x%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D+x%28t%29+-+x%28t%29%5E3+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{d x}{d t} = x(t) - x(t)^3 } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>This has stable equilibrium solutions at <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%3D+%5Cpm+1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x = &#92;pm 1" class="latex" /> and an unstable equilibrium in between at <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x = 0" class="latex" />.  So, this is a bistable model similar to the one we&#8217;ve been studying, but mathematically simpler!  </p>
<p>Then we can add an oscillating time-dependent term:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7Bd+x%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D+x%28t%29+-+x%28t%29%5E3+%2B+A+%5C%3B++%5Csin%28t%29+%7D++&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{d x}{d t} = x(t) - x(t)^3 + A &#92;;  &#92;sin(t) }  " class="latex" /></p>
<p>which wiggles the system back and forth.  This can make it jump from one equilibrium to another.  </p>
<p>And then we can add on noise:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7Bd+x%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D+x%28t%29+-+x%28t%29%5E3+%2B+A+%5C%3B++%5Csin%28t%29++%2B+%5Csqrt%7B2D%7D+w%28t%29+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{d x}{d t} = x(t) - x(t)^3 + A &#92;;  &#92;sin(t)  + &#92;sqrt{2D} w(t) } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see what the solutions look like!</p>
<p>In the following graphs, the green curve is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+%5Csin%28t%29%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A &#92;sin(t)," class="latex" />, while the red curve is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%28t%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x(t)" class="latex" />.  Here is a simulation with a low level of noise:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/files/stochres_weaknoise.jpg" alt="low noise level" />
</div>
<p>As you can see, within the time of the simulation there is no transition from the stable state at 1 to the one at -1. If we were doing a climate model, this would be like the Earth staying in the warm state.</p>
<p>Here is a simulation with a high noise level:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/Stochastic_Resonance_High_Noise_Level.JPG" alt="high noise level" />
</div>
<p>The solution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%28t%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x(t)" class="latex" /> jumps around wildly. By inspecting the graph with your eyes only, you don&#8217;t see any pattern in it, do you?</p>
<p>But finally, here is a simulation where the noise level is not too small, and not too big:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/files/stochres_intermednoise.jpg" alt="high noise level" />
</div>
<p>Here we see the noise helping the solution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%28t%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x(t)" class="latex" /> hops from around <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%3D+-1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x = -1" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%3D+1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x = 1" class="latex" />, or vice versa.  The solution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%28t%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x(t)" class="latex" /> is not at all &#8216;periodic&#8217;&#8212;it&#8217;s quite random.  But still, it tends to hop back and forth thanks to the combination of the sinusoidal term <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+%5Csin%28t%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A &#92;sin(t)" class="latex" /> and the noise.</p>
<p>Glyn Adgie, Allan Erskine, Jim Stuttard and Tim van Beek have created an online model that lets you solve this stochastic differential equation for different values of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="D" class="latex" />.  You can try it here:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.adgie.f9.co.uk/azimuth/stochastic-resonance/Javascript/StochasticResonanceEuler.html">Stochastic resonance example</a>.</p>
<p>You can change the values using the sliders under the graphic and see what happens. You can also choose different &#8216;random seeds&#8217;, which means that the random numbers used in the simulation will be different.</p>

<p>In future weeks I hope to say more about the actual <i>evidence</i> that stochastic resonance plays a role in our glacial cycles!  It would also be great to go back to our climate model from <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/11/10/mathematics-and-the-environment-part-6/">last time</a> and add noise.   We&#8217;re working on that.</p>

					<h3> Frosty dunes </h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/astronomical/mars_polar_dunes_big.jpg"><img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/astronomical/mars_polar_dunes.jpg" /></a>
</div>
<p>I love this photo, because it shows that Mars is a lively place with wind and water.  These dunes near the north pole, occupying a region the size of Texas, have been sculpted by wind into long lines with crests 500 meters apart. Their hollows are covered with frost, which appears bluish-white in this infrared photograph. The big white spot near the bottom is a hill 100 meters high.</p>
<p>For more info, go here:</p>
<p>&bull; THEMIS, <a href="http://themis.mars.asu.edu/features/polardunes">North polar sand sea</a>. </p>
<p>If you download the full-sized version of this photo, either by clicking on my picture or going to this webpage, you&#8217;ll see it&#8217;s astoundingly detailed!  </p>
<p><a href="http://themis.asu.edu/">THEMIS</a> is the Thermal Emission Imaging System aboard the Mars Odyssey spacecraft, which has been orbiting Mars since 2002.   It combines a 5-wavelength visual imaging system with a 9-wavelength infrared imaging system.  It&#8217;s been taking great pictures&#8212;especially of regions that are too rugged for rovers like Opportunity, Spirit and Curiosity.  </p>
<p>Because those rovers landed in places that were chosen to be safe, the pictures they take sometimes make Mars look&#8230; well, a bit dull.  It&#8217;s not!</p>
<p>Let me show you what I mean.</p>
<h3> Barchans </h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/astronomical/mars_barchans.jpg"><img width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/astronomical/mars_barchans_vertical.jpg" /></a>
</div>
<p>These are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barchan">barchans</a> on Mars, C-shaped sand dunes that slowly move through the desert like this:</p>
<p>C<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;C<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C</p>
<p>And see the dark fuzzy stuff?   More on that later!</p>
<p>Barchans are also found on Earth, and surely on many other planets across the Universe.  They&#8217;re one of several basic dune patterns&#8212;an inevitable consequence of the laws of nature under fairly common conditions.</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barchan"><img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/astronomical/barchan.jpg" /></a>
</div>
<p>Sand gradually accumulates on the upwind side of a barchan.  Then it falls down the other side, called the &#8216;slip face&#8217;.  The upwind slope is gentle, while the slope of the slip face is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_of_repose">angle of repose</a> for sand: the maximum angle it can tolerate before it starts slipping down.  On Earth that&#8217;s between 32 and 34 degrees.</p>
<p><b>Puzzle:</b> What is the angle of repose of sand on Mars?  Does the weaker pull of gravity let sandpiles be steeper?  Or are they just as steep as on Earth?</p>
<p>Barchans gradually migrate in the direction of the wind, with small barchans moving faster than big ones.  And when barchans collide, the smaller ones pass right through the big ones!  So, they&#8217;re a bit like what physicists call <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soliton">solitons</a>: waves that maintain their identity like particles.  However, they display more complicated behaviors.</p>
<p>This simulation shows what can happen when two collide:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/astronomical/barchan_collision_no_offset_duran_et_al.jpg"><img width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/astronomical/barchan_collision_no_offset_duran_et_al.jpg" /></a>
</div>
<p> Depending on the parameters, they can:</p>
<p><b>c</b>: <b>c</b>oalesce into one barchan,</p>
<p><b>b</b>: <b>b</b>reed to form more barchans,</p>
<p><b>bu</b>: <b>bu</b>d, with the smaller one splitting in two, or</p>
<p><b>s</b>: act like <b>s</b>olitons, with one going right through the other!  </p>

<p>In this picture there is no &#8216;offset&#8217; between the colliding barchans: they hit head-on.  With an offset, more complicated things can happen &#8211; check out this picture:</p>

</div>
<p>It may seem surprising that there&#8217;s enough wind on Mars to create dunes.  After all, the air pressure there is about 1% what it is here on Earth!  But in fact the wind speed on Mars often exceeds 200 kilometers per hour, with gusts up to 600 kilometers per hour. There are dust storms on Mars so big they were first seen from telescopes on Earth long ago.  So, wind is a big factor in Martian geology:</p>
<p>&bull; NASA, <a href="http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/gallery/duststorms/">Mars exploration program: dust storms</a>.</p>
<p>The Mars rover Spirit even got its solar panels cleaned by some dust devils, and it took some movies of them:</p>

<h3> Geysers? </h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/007962_2635.jpg"><img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/007962_2635.jpg" /></a>
</div>
<p>This picture shows a dune field less than 400 kilometers from the north pole, bordered on both sides by flat regions&#8212;but also a big cliff at one end.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a closeup of those dunes&#8230; with stands of trees on top?!?  </p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/astronomical/mars_possible_geysers_big.jpg"><img width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/astronomical/mars_possible_geysers.jpg" /></a>
</div>
<p>No, that&#8217;s an optical illusion.  But whatever it is, it&#8217;s something strange.  Robert Krulwich put it nicely:</p>
<blockquote><p>They were first seen in 1998; they don&#8217;t look like anything we have here on Earth. To this day, no one is sure what they are, but we now know this: They come, then they go. Every Martian spring, they appear out of nowhere, showing up&mdash;70 percent of the time&mdash;where they were the year before. They pop up suddenly, sometimes overnight. When winter comes, they vanish.</p></blockquote>
<p>In 2010, astronomer Candy Hansen tried to explain what&#8217;s going on, writing:</p>
<blockquote><p>
There is a vast region of sand dunes at high northern latitudes on Mars. In the winter, a layer of carbon dioxide ice covers the dunes, and in the spring as the sun warms the ice it evaporates. This is a very active process, and sand dislodged from the crests of the dunes cascades down, forming dark streaks.
</p></blockquote>
<p>She focused our attention on this piece of the image:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/astronomical/mars_possible_geysers_subimage.jpg"><img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/astronomical/mars_possible_geysers_subimage.jpg" /></a>
</div>
<p>and she wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
 In the subimage falling material has kicked up a small cloud of dust. The color of the ice surrounding adjacent streaks of material suggests that dust has settled on the ice at the bottom after similar events.</p>
<p>Also discernible in this subimage are polygonal cracks in the ice on the dunes (the cracks disappear when the ice is gone).
</p></blockquote>
<p>More recently, though, scientists have suggested that geysers are involved in this process, which might make it very active indeed!</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/astronomical/mars_geysers.jpg"><img width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/astronomical/mars_geysers.jpg" /></a>
</div>
<p>Geysers formed as frozen carbon dioxide turns to gas, shooting out clumps of dark, basaltic sand, which slide down the dunes&#8230; that&#8217;s the most popular explanation.  But maybe they&#8217;re colonies of photosynthetic Martian microorganisms soaking up the sunlight!  Or maybe geysers are shooting up dark stuff that&#8217;s organic matter formed by some biological process.  A bunch form right around sunrise, so something is being rapidly triggered by the sun.</p>
<p>This has some nice prose and awesome pictures:</p>

There is an enigmatic region near the south pole of Mars known as the &#8220;cryptic&#8221; terrain. It stays cold in the spring, even as its albedo darkens and the sun rises in the sky.</p>
<p>This region is covered by a layer of translucent seasonal carbon dioxide ice that warms and evaporates from below. As carbon dioxide gas escapes from below the slab of seasonal ice it scours dust from the surface. The gas vents to the surface, where the dust is carried downwind by the prevailing wind.</p>
<p>The channels carved by the escaping gas are often radially organized and are known informally as &#8220;spiders.&#8221;

<h3> Vastitas Borealis </h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s ice in a crater in the northern plains on Mars&mdash;the region with the wonderful name <b>Vastitas Borealis</b>:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/astronomical/mars_crater_ice.jpg"><img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/astronomical/mars_crater_ice.jpg" /></a>

<p>Many scientists believe this huge plain was an ocean during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hesperian">Hesperian Epoch</a>, a period of Martian history that stretches from about 3.5 to about 1.8 billion years ago.   Later, around the end of the Hesperian, they think about 30% of the water on Mars evaporated and left the atmosphere, drifting off into outer space&#8230; part of the danger of life on a planet without much gravity.  The oceans then froze.  Most of them  slowly sublimated, disappearing into water vapor without ever melting.  This water vapor was also lost to outer space. </p>
<p>&bull; Linda M. V. Martel, <a href="http://www.psrd.hawaii.edu/July03/MartianSea.html">Ancient floodwaters and seas on Mars</a>.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s still a lot of water left, especially in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martian_polar_ice_caps">polar ice caps</a>.  The north pole has an ice cap with 820,000 cubic kilometers of ice!  That&#8217;s equal to 30% of the Earth&#8217;s Greenland ice sheet&mdash;enough to cover the whole surface of Mars to a depth of 5.6 meters if it melted, if we pretend Mars is flat.  </p>
<p>And the south pole is covered by a slab of ice about 3 kilometers thick, a mixture of 85% carbon dioxide ice and 15% water ice, surrounded by steep slopes made almost entirely of water ice.   This has enough water that if it melted it would cover the whole surface to a depth of 11 meters!</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also lots of permafrost underground, and frost on the surface, and bits of ice like this.  The picture above was taken by the Mars Express satellite:</p>

<p>The image is close to natural color, but the vertical relief is exaggerated by a factor of 3. The crater is 35 kilometers wide and 2 kilometers deep. It&#8217;s incredible how they can get this kind of picture from satellite photos and lots of clever image processing. I hope they didn&#8217;t do too much stuff just to make it look pretty.</p>
<h3> Chasma Boreale </h3>
<p>Here is the north pole of Mars:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/astronomical/chasma_boreale.jpg"><img width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/astronomical/mars_north_pole.jpg" /></a>
</div>
<p>As in Antarctica and Greenland, cold dense air flows downwards off the polar ice cap, creating intense winds called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katabatic_wind">katabatic winds</a>. These pick up and redeposit surface ice to make grooves in the ice.  The swirly pattern comes from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_effect">Coriolis effect</a>: while the winds are blowing more or less straight, Mars is turning around its pole, so they seem to swerve.</p>
<p>As you can see, the north polar ice cap has a huge canyon running through it, called <b>Chasma Boreale</b>:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/astronomical/chasma_boreale.jpg"><img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/astronomical/mars_north_pole_ice_cap.jpg" /></a>
</div>
<p>Here&#8217;s an amazing picture of what it&#8217;d be like to stand near the head of this chasm:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/astronomical/chasma_boreale.jpg"><img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/astronomical/chasma_boreale.jpg" /></a>
</div>
<p>Click to enlarge this&mdash;it deserves to be bigger!   Here&#8217;s the story:</p>
<blockquote><p>Climatic cycles of ice and dust built the Martian polar caps, season by season, year by year&mdash;and then whittled down their size when the climate changed. Here we are looking at the head of Chasma Boreale, a canyon that reaches 570 kilometers (350 miles) into the north polar cap. Canyon walls rise about 1,400 meters (4,600 feet) above the floor. Where the edge of the ice cap has retreated, sheets of sand are emerging that accumulated during earlier ice-free climatic cycles. Winds blowing off the ice have pushed loose sand into dunes, then driven them down-canyon in a westward direction, toward our viewpoint.</p></blockquote>
<p>The above picture was cleverly created using photos from THEMIS.   The vertical scale has been exaggerated by a factor of 2.5, I&#8217;m sad to say.  You can download a 9-megabyte version from here:</p>
<p>&bull; THEMIS, <a href="http://themis.asu.edu/node/5488">Chasma Boreale and the north polar ice cap</a>.</p>
<p>and you can see an actual photo of this same canyon here:</p>
<p>&bull; THEMIS, <a href="http://themis.asu.edu/feature/19">Dunes and ice in Chasma Boreale</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s beautifully detailed; here&#8217;s a miniature version:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://themis.asu.edu/feature/19"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/astronomical/chasma_boreale_vertical.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>and a sub-image that shows the layers of ice and sand:</p>

<p>Scientists are studying these layers in the ice cap to see if they match computer simulations of the climate of Mars.  Just as the Earth&#8217;s orbit goes through changes called <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week318.html">Milankovitch cycles</a>, so does the orbit of Mars.  These affect the climate: for example, when the tilt is big the tropics become colder, and polar ice migrates toward the equator.   I don&#8217;t know much about this, despite my interest in Milankovitch cycles.  What&#8217;s a good place to start learning more?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a closer view of icy dunes near the North pole:</p>

<h3> Martian Sunset </h3>
<p>As we&#8217;ve seen, Mars is a beautiful world, but a world in a minor key, a world whose glory days&mdash;the Hesperian Epoch&mdash;are long gone, whose once grand oceans are now reduced to windy canyons, icy dunes, and the massive ice caps of the poles.  Let&#8217;s say goodbye to it for now&#8230; leaving off with this Martian sunset, photographed by the rover Spirit in Gusev Crater on May 19th, 2005.</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/astronomical/mars_sunset_big.jpg"><img width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/astronomical/mars_sunset.jpg" /></a>
</div>
<p>&bull; NASA Mars Exploration Rover Mission, <a href="http://marsrovers.nasa.gov/gallery/press/spirit/20050610a.html">A moment frozen in time</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>
This Panoramic Camera (Pancam) mosaic was taken around 6:07 in the evening of the rover&#8217;s 489th martian day, or sol. Spirit was commanded to stay awake briefly after sending that sol&#8217;s data to the Mars Odyssey orbiter just before sunset. This small panorama of the western sky was obtained using Pancam&#8217;s 750-nanometer, 530-nanometer and 430-nanometer color filters. This filter combination allows false color images to be generated that are similar to what a human would see, but with the colors slightly exaggerated. In this image, the bluish glow in the sky above the Sun would be visible to us if we were there, but an artifact of the Pancam&#8217;s infrared imaging capabilities is that with this filter combination the redness of the sky farther from the sunset is exaggerated compared to the daytime colors of the martian sky.</p>
<p>Because Mars is farther from the Sun than the Earth is, the Sun appears only about two-thirds the size that it appears in a sunset seen from the Earth. The terrain in the foreground is the rock outcrop &#8220;Jibsheet&#8221;, a feature that Spirit has been investigating for several weeks (rover tracks are dimly visible leading up to Jibsheet). The floor of Gusev crater is visible in the distance, and the Sun is setting behind the wall of Gusev some 80 km (50 miles) in the distance.</p>
<p>This mosaic is yet another example from MER of a beautiful, sublime martian scene that also captures some important scientific information. Specifically, sunset and twilight images are occasionally acquired by the science team to determine how high into the atmosphere the martian dust extends, and to look for dust or ice clouds. Other images have shown that the twilight glow remains visible, but increasingly fainter, for up to two hours before sunrise or after sunset. The long martian twilight (compared to Earth&#8217;s) is caused by sunlight scattered around to the night side of the planet by abundant high altitude dust. Similar long twilights or extra-colorful sunrises and sunsets sometimes occur on Earth when tiny dust grains that are erupted from powerful volcanoes scatter light high in the atmosphere.

					<p><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/11/06/mathematics-and-the-environment-part-5/">Last time</a> we saw a &#8216;bistable&#8217; climate model, where the temperatures compatible with a given amount of sunshine can form an S-shaped curve like this:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="400" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week319_temperature_versus_insolation.jpg" />
</div>
<p>The horizontal axis is insolation, the vertical is temperature.  Between the green and the red lines the Earth can have 3 temperatures compatible with a given insolation.    For example, the black vertical line intersects the S-shaped curve in three points.  So we get three possible solutions: a hot Earth, a cold Earth, and an intermediate Earth.  </p>
<p>But last time I claimed the intermediate Earth was unstable, so there are just two stable solutions.  So, we say this model is <b>bistable</b>.  This is like a simple light switch, which has two stable positions but also an intermediate unstable position halfway in between.  </p>
<p>(Have you ever enjoyed putting a light switch into this intermediate position?  If not, you must not be a physicist.)</p>
<p>Why is the intermediate equilibrium unstable?  It seems plausible from the light switch example, but to be sure, we need to go back and study the original equation:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+C+%5Cfrac%7Bd+T%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D+-+A+-+B+T+%2B+Q+c%28T%28t%29%29+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ C &#92;frac{d T}{d t} = - A - B T + Q c(T(t)) }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>We need see what happens when we push <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T" class="latex" /> slightly away from one of its equilibrium values.  We could do this analytically or numerically.  </p>
<p>Luckily, Allan Erskine has made a wonderful program that lets us study it numerically: check it out!</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/coalbedo/temperature.html">Temperature dynamics</a>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s you&#8217;ll see a bunch of graphs of temperature as a function of time, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T%28t%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T(t)." class="latex" />  To spice things up, Allan has made the insolation a function of time, which starts out big for some interval <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5B0%2C%5Ctau%5D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="[0,&#92;tau]" class="latex" /> and then drops to its usual value <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q+%3D+341.5.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Q = 341.5." class="latex" />  So, these graphs are solutions of</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+C+%5Cfrac%7Bd+T%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D+-+A+-+B+T+%2B+Q%28t%29+c%28T%28t%29%29+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ C &#92;frac{d T}{d t} = - A - B T + Q(t) c(T(t)) } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q%28t%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Q(t)" class="latex" /> is a step function with</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q%28t%29+%3D+%5Cleft%5C%7B+%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Bccl%7D+Q+%2B+X+%26+%5Cmathrm%7Bfor%7D+%26+0+%5Cle+t+%5Cle+%5Ctau+%5C%5C++Q+%26+%5Cmathrm%7Bfor%7D+%26+t+%3E+%5Ctau++%5Cend%7Barray%7D+%5Cright.+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Q(t) = &#92;left&#92;{ &#92;begin{array}{ccl} Q + X &amp; &#92;mathrm{for} &amp; 0 &#92;le t &#92;le &#92;tau &#92;&#92;  Q &amp; &#92;mathrm{for} &amp; t &gt; &#92;tau  &#92;end{array} &#92;right. " class="latex" /></p>
<p>The different graphs show solutions with different initial conditions, ranging from <font color="red">hot</font> to <font color="blue">cold</font>.  Using sliders on the bottom, you can adjust:</p>
<p>&bull; the coalbedo transition rate <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;gamma," class="latex" /></p>
<p>&bull; the amount <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> of extra insolation, </p>
<p>&bull; the time <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;tau" class="latex" /> at which the extra insolation ends.</p>
<p>I urge you to start by setting <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;tau" class="latex" /> to its maximum value.  That will make the insolation be constant as a function of time.  Then you  if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;gamma" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> are big enough, you&#8217;ll get bistability.  For example:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ecological/bistable_climate_model_1.jpg"><img width="300" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ecological/bistable_climate_model_1.jpg" /></a>
</div>
<p>I get this with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;gamma" class="latex" /> about 0.08, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> about 28.5.  You can see a hot stable equilibrium, a cold one, and a solution that hesitates between the two for quite a while before going up to the hot one.  This intermediate solution must be starting out very slightly above the unstable equilibrium.  </p>
<p>When <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> is zero, there&#8217;s only one equilibrium solution: the cold Earth.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t make <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> so big that the hot Earth is the only equilibrium, but it&#8217;s possible according to our model: I&#8217;ll need to change the software a bit to let us make the insolation bigger.</p>
<p>All sorts of more interesting things happen when we move <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;tau" class="latex" /> down from its maximum value.   I hope you play with the parameters and see what happens.  But essentially, what happens is that the hot Earth is only stable before <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t+%3D+%5Ctau%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="t = &#92;tau," class="latex" /> since we need the extra insolation to make that happen.  After that, the Earth is fated to go to a cold state.</p>
<p>Needless to say, these results should not be trusted when it comes to the actual climate of our actual planet!  More about that later.</p>
<p>We can also check the bistability in a more analytical way.  We get an equilibrium solution of </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+C+%5Cfrac%7Bd+T%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D+-+A+-+B+T+%2B+Q+c%28T%28t%29%29+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ C &#92;frac{d T}{d t} = - A - B T + Q c(T(t)) } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>whenever we find a number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T" class="latex" /> obeying this equation:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=-+A+-+B+T+%2B+Q+c%28T%29+%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="- A - B T + Q c(T) = 0" class="latex" /></p>
<p>We can show that for certain values of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;gamma" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Q," class="latex" /> we get solutions for three different temperatures <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T." class="latex" />  It&#8217;s easy to see that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=-+A+-+B+T+%2B+Q+c%28T%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="- A - B T + Q c(T) " class="latex" /> is positive for very small <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T" class="latex" />: if the Earth were extremely cold, the Sun would warm it up.  Similarly, this quantity is negative for very large <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T" class="latex" />: the Earth would cool down if it were very hot.   So, the reason </p>

<p>has three solutions is that it starts out positive, then goes down below zero, then goes up above zero, and then goes down below zero again.  So, for the intermediate point at which it&#8217;s zero, we have</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B%5Cfrac%7Bd%7D%7BdT%7D%28+-A+-+B+T+%2B+Q+c%28T%29%29+%3E+0++%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{&#92;frac{d}{dT}( -A - B T + Q c(T)) &gt; 0  }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>That means that if it starts out slightly warmer than this value of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T," class="latex" /> the temperature will <i>increase</i>&#8212;so this solution is unstable.  For the hot and cold solutions, we get</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7Bd%7D%7BdT%7D%28-A+-+B+T+%2B+Q+c%28T%29%29+%3C+0++%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{d}{dT}(-A - B T + Q c(T)) &lt; 0  }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>so these equilibria are stable. </p>
<h3> A moral </h3>
<p>What morals can we extract from this model?</p>
<p>As far as climate science goes, one moral is that it pays to spend some time making sure we understand simple models before we dive into more complicated ones.  Right now we&#8217;re looking at a <i>very</i> simple one, but we&#8217;re already seeing some interesting phenomena.  The kind of model we&#8217;re looking at now is called a <b>Budyko-Sellers model</b>. These have been studied since the late 1960&#8217;s:</p>

Atmos. Sci.</a></i> <b>36</b> (1979), 255-259.</p>
<p>I should talk more about some slightly more complex models someday.</p>
<p>It also pays to compare our models to reality!   For example, the graphs we&#8217;ve seen show some remarkably hot and cold temperatures for the Earth.  That&#8217;s a bit unnerving.  Let&#8217;s investigate.  Suppose we set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma+%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;gamma = 0" class="latex" /> on our slider.  Then the coalbedo of the Earth becomes independent of temperature: it&#8217;s 0.525, halfway between its icy and ice-free values.  Then, when the insolation takes its actual value of 342.5 watts per square meter, the model says the Earth&#8217;s temperature is very chilly: about -20 &deg;C!</p>
<p>Does that mean the model is fundamentally flawed?  Maybe not!  After all, it&#8217;s based on very light-colored Earth.  Suppose we use the <i>actual</i> albedo of the Earth.  Of course that&#8217;s hard to define, much less determine.  But let&#8217;s just look up some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo#Terrestrial_albedo">average value of the Earth&#8217;s albedo</a>: supposedly it&#8217;s about 0.3.  That gives a coalbedo of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+%3D+0.7.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c = 0.7." class="latex" />  If we plug that in our formula:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+Q+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B+A+%2B+B+T+%7D+%7Bc%7D+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ Q = &#92;frac{ A + B T } {c} }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>we get 11 &deg;C.  That&#8217;s not too far from the Earth&#8217;s actual average temperature, namely about 15 &deg;C.   So the chilly temperature of -20 &deg;C seems to come from an Earth that&#8217;s a lot lighter in color than ours.  </p>
<p>Our model includes the greenhouse effect, since the coeficients <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B" class="latex" /> were determined by satellite measurements of how much radiation actually escapes the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere and shoots out into space.  As a further check to our model, we can look at an even <i>simpler</i> zero-dimensional energy balance model: a completely black Earth with no greenhouse effect.  We discussed that earlier.</p>
<p>As he explains, this model gives the Earth a temperature of 6 &deg;C.  He also shows that in this model, lowering the albedo to a realistic value of 0.3 lowers the temperature to a chilly -18 &deg; C.  To get from that to something like our Earth, we must take the greenhouse effect into account.</p>
<p>This sort of fiddling around is the sort of thing we must do to study the flaws and virtues of a climate model.  Of course, any <i>realistic</i> climate model is vastly more sophisticated than the little toy we&#8217;ve been looking at, so the &#8216;fiddling around&#8217; must also be more sophisticated.  With a more sophisticated model, we can also be more demanding.  For example, when I said 11 &deg;C is &#8220;is not too far from the Earth&#8217;s actual average temperature, namely about 15 &deg;C&#8221;, I was being very blas&eacute; about what&#8217;s actually a big discrepancy.  I only took that attitude because the calculations we&#8217;re doing now are very preliminary.   </p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>We saw <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/10/22/mathematics-of-the-environment-part-4/">last time</a> that the Earth&#8217;s temperature seems to have been getting colder but also more erratic for the last 30 million years or so.  Here&#8217;s the last 5 million again:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://www.globalwarmingart.com/wiki/File:Five_Myr_Climate_Change_Rev_png"><img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature/5Myr.png" /></a></div>
<p>People think these glacial cycles are due to variations in the Earth&#8217;s orbit, but as we&#8217;ll see later, those cause quite small changes in &#8216;insolation&#8217;&#8212;roughly, the amount of sunshine hitting the Earth (as a function of time and location).   So, M. I. Budyko, an expert on the glacial cycles, wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Thus, the present thermal regime and glaciations of the Earth prove to be characterized by high instability. Comparatively small changes of radiation—only by 1.0-1.5%—are sufficient for the development of ice cover on the land and oceans that reaches temperate latitudes.
</p></blockquote>
<p>How can small changes in the amount of sunlight hitting the Earth, or other parameters, create big changes in the Earth&#8217;s temperature?   The obvious answer is <i>positive feedback</i>: some sort of amplifying effect.  </p>
<p>But what could it be?  Do we know feedback mechanisms that can amplify small changes in temperature?  Yes.  Here are a few obvious ones:</p>
<p>&bull; <b><a href="http://geotest.tamu.edu/userfiles/216/dessler09.pdf">Water vapor feedback</a></b>.  When it gets warmer, more water evaporates, and the air becomes more humid. But water vapor is a greenhouse gas, which causes additional warming.  Conversely, when the Earth cools down, the air becomes drier, so the greenhouse effect becomes weaker, which tends to cool things down.</p>
<p>&bull; <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice-albedo_feedback">Ice albedo feedback</a>.</b>  Snow and ice reflect more light than liquid oceans or soil.  When the Earth warms up, snow and ice melt, so the Earth becomes darker, absorbs more light, and tends to get get even warmer.  Conversely, when the Earth cools down, more snow and ice form, so the Earth becomes lighter, absorbs less light, and tends to get even cooler.</p>
<p>&bull; <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_feedback#CO2_in_the_oceans">Carbon dioxide solubility feedback</a>.</b>  Cold water can hold more carbon dioxide than warm water: that&#8217;s why opening a warm can of soda can be so explosive.  So, when the Earth&#8217;s oceans warm up, they release carbon dioxide.  But carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, which causes additional warming.  Conversely, when the oceaans cool down, they absorb more carbon dioxide, so the greenhouse effect becomes weaker, which tends to cool things down.</p>
<p>Of course, there are also negative feedbacks: otherwise the climate would be utterly unstable!  There are also complicated feedbacks whose overall effect is harder to evaluate:</p>
<p>&bull; <b>Planck feedback.</b>  A hotter world radiates more heat, which cools it down.  This is the big negative feedback that keeps all the positive feedbacks from making the Earth insanely hot or insanely cold.</p>
<p>&bull; <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_feedback">Cloud feedback</a>.</b> A warmer Earth has more clouds, which reflect more light but also increase the greenhouse effect. </p>
<p>&bull; <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_feedback#Lapse_rate">Lapse rate feedback</a>.</b>   An increased greenhouse effect changes the vertical temperature profile of the atmosphere, which has effects of its own&mdash;but this works differently near the poles and near the equator.    </p>
<p>See also <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week302.html">&#8220;week302&#8221;</a> of <i>This Week&#8217;s Finds</i>, where <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Nathan+Urban">Nathan Urban</a> tells us more about feedbacks and how big they&#8217;re likely to be.  </p>
<p>Understanding all these feedbacks, and which ones are important for the glacial cycles we see, is a complicated business.  Instead of diving straight into this, let&#8217;s try something much simpler.  Let&#8217;s just think about how the ice albedo effect could, in theory, make the Earth bistable.</p>
<p>To do this, let&#8217;s look at the very simplest model in this great not-yet-published book:</p>
<p>&bull; Gerald R. North, <i>Simple Models of Global Climate</i>.</p>
<p>This is a <b>zero-dimensional energy balance model</b>, meaning that it only involves the average temperature of the earth, the average solar radiation coming in, and the average infrared radiation going out.</p>
<p>The average temperature will be <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T," class="latex" /> measured in Celsius.  We&#8217;ll assume the Earth radiates power square meter equal to</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+A+%2B+B+T+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ A + B T }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+%3D+218&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A = 218" class="latex" /> watts/meter<sup>2</sup> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B+%3D+1.90&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B = 1.90" class="latex" /> watts/meter<sup>2</sup> per degree Celsius.  This is a linear approximation taken from satellite data on our Earth.  In reality, the power emitted grows faster than linearly with temperature.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll assume the Earth absorbs solar energy power per square meter equal to</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q+c%28T%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Q c(T) " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Here:</p>
<p>&bull; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Q" class="latex" /> is the average <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insolation">insolation</a></b>: that is, the amount of solar power per square meter hitting the top of the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere, averaged over location and time of year. In reality <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Q" class="latex" /> is about 341.5 watts/meter<sup>2</sup>.  This is one quarter of the <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Solar%20radiation"><b>solar constant</b></a>, meaning the solar power per square meter that would hit a panel hovering in space above the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere and facing directly at the Sun.  (Why a quarter?  We&#8217;ve seen why: it&#8217;s because the area of a sphere is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=4+%5Cpi+r%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="4 &#92;pi r^2" class="latex" /> while the area of a circle is just <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi+r%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;pi r^2" class="latex" />.)</p>
<p>&bull; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%28T%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c(T)" class="latex" /> is the <b>coalbedo</b>: the fraction of solar power that gets absorbed.  The coalbedo depends on the temperature; we&#8217;ll have to say how.</p>
<p>Given all this, we get</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+C+%5Cfrac%7Bd+T%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D+-+A+-+B+T+%2B+Q+c%28T%28t%29%29+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ C &#92;frac{d T}{d t} = - A - B T + Q c(T(t)) }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C" class="latex" /> is Earth&#8217;s heat capacity in joules per degree per square meter.  Of course this is a funny thing, because heat energy is stored not only at the surface but also in the air and/or water, and the details vary a lot depending on where we are.  But if we consider a uniform planet with dry air and no ocean, North says we may roughly take <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C" class="latex" /> equal to about half the heat capacity at constant pressure of the column of dry air over a square meter, namely 5 million joules per degree Celsius.</p>
<p>The easiest thing to do is find equilibrium solutions, meaning solutions where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7Bd+T%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D+0%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;frac{d T}{d t} = 0," class="latex" /> so that</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+%2B+B+T+%3D+Q+c%28T%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A + B T = Q c(T) " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Now <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C" class="latex" /> doesn&#8217;t matter anymore!  We&#8217;d like to solve for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T" class="latex" /> as a function of the insolation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Q," class="latex" /> but it&#8217;s easier to solve for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Q" class="latex" /> as a function of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T" class="latex" />:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+Q+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B+A+%2B+B+T+%7D+%7Bc%28T%29%7D+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ Q = &#92;frac{ A + B T } {c(T)} }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>To go further, we need to guess some formula for the coalbedo <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%28T%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c(T)." class="latex" /> The coalbedo, remember, is the fraction of sunlight that gets absorbed when it hits the Earth.  It&#8217;s 1 minus the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo"><b>albedo</b></a>, which is the fraction that gets reflected.  Here&#8217;s a little chart of albedos:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Albedo-e_hg.svg/429px-Albedo-e_hg.svg.png" /></a></div>
<p>If you get mixed up between albedo and coalbedo, just remember: coal has a high coalbedo.</p>
<p>Since we&#8217;re trying to keep things very simple right not, <i>not</i> model nature in all its glorious complexity, let&#8217;s just say the average albedo of the Earth is 0.65 when it&#8217;s very cold and there&#8217;s lots of snow.  So, let</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_i+%3D+1++-+0.65+%3D++0.35+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c_i = 1  - 0.65 =  0.35 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>be the &#8216;<b>i</b>cy&#8217; coalbedo, good for very low temperatures.  Similarly, let&#8217;s say the average albedo drops to 0.3 when its very hot and the Earth is darker.  So, let </p>

<p>be the &#8216;ice-<b>f</b>ree&#8217; coalbedo, good for high temperatures when the Earth is darker.  </p>
<p>Then, we need a function of temperature that interpolates between <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c_i" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_f.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c_f." class="latex" />  Let&#8217;s try this:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%28T%29+%3D+c_i+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D+%28c_f-c_i%29+%281+%2B+%5Ctanh%28%5Cgamma+T%29%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c(T) = c_i + &#92;frac{1}{2} (c_f-c_i) (1 + &#92;tanh(&#92;gamma T)) " class="latex" /></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not a fan of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_function">hyperbolic tangent</a> function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctanh%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;tanh," class="latex" /> this may seem scary.  But don&#8217;t be intimidated!</p>
<p>The function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%281+%2B+%5Ctanh%28%5Cgamma+T%29%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;frac{1}{2}(1 + &#92;tanh(&#92;gamma T)) " class="latex" /> is just a function that goes smoothly from 0 at low temperatures to 1 at high temperatures.  This ensures that the coalbedo is near its icy value <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c_i" class="latex" /> at low temperatures, and near its ice-free value <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c_f" class="latex" /> at high temperatures.  But the fun part here is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;gamma," class="latex" /> a parameter that says how rapidly the coalbedo rises as the Earth gets warmer.  Depending on this, we&#8217;ll get different effects!</p>
<p>The function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%28T%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c(T)" class="latex" /> rises fastest at <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T+%3D+0%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T = 0," class="latex" /> since that&#8217;s where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctanh+%28%5Cgamma+T%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;tanh (&#92;gamma T)" class="latex" /> has the biggest slope.  We&#8217;re just lucky that in Celsius <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T+%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T = 0" class="latex" /> is the melting point of ice, so this makes a bit of sense.</p>
<p>Now <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Allan+Erskine">Allan Erskine</a>&#8216;s programming magic comes into play!  I&#8217;m very fortunate that the Azimuth Project has attracted some programmers who can make nice software for me to show you.  Unfortunately his software doesn&#8217;t work on this blog&mdash;yet!&mdash;so please hop over here to see it in action:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/coalbedo/coalbedo_new.html">Temperature versus insolation</a>.</p>
<p>You can slide a slider to adjust the parameter <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;gamma" class="latex" /> to various values between 0 and 1.  </p>
<p>In the little graph at right, you can see how the coalbedo <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%28T%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c(T)" class="latex" /> changes as a function of the temperature <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T." class="latex" /> In this graph the temperature ranges from -50 &deg;C and 50 &deg;C; the graph depends on what value of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;gamma" class="latex" /> you choose with slider.</p>
<p>In the big graph at left, you can see how the insolation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Q" class="latex" /> required to yield a given temperature <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T" class="latex" /> between -50 &deg;C and 50 &deg;C.   As we&#8217;ve seen, it&#8217;s easiest to graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Q" class="latex" /> as a function of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T%3A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T:" class="latex" /> </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+Q+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B+A+%2B+B+T+%7D+%7Bc_i+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D+%28c_f-c_i%29+%281+%2B+%5Ctanh%28%5Cgamma+T%29%29%7D+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ Q = &#92;frac{ A + B T } {c_i + &#92;frac{1}{2} (c_f-c_i) (1 + &#92;tanh(&#92;gamma T))} }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>Solving for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T" class="latex" /> here is hard, but we can just flip the graph over to see what equilibrium temperatures <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T" class="latex" /> are allowed for a given insolation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Q" class="latex" /> between 200 and 500 watts per square mater.</p>
<p>The exciting thing is that when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;gamma" class="latex" /> gets big enough, <i>three different temperatures are compatible with the same amount of insolation!</i>  This means the Earth can be hot, cold or something intermediate even when the amount of sunlight hitting it is fixed.  The intermediate state is unstable, it turns out&#8212;we&#8217;ll see why later.  Only the hot and cold states are stable.  So, we say the Earth is <b>bistable</b> in this simplified model.</p>
<p>Can you see how big <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;gamma" class="latex" /> needs to be for this bistability to kick in?  It&#8217;s certainly there when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma+%3D+0.05%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;gamma = 0.05," class="latex" /> since then we get a graph like this:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week319_temperature_versus_insolation.jpg" />
</div>
<p>When the insolation is less than about 385 W/m<sup>2</sup> there&#8217;s only a cold state.  When it hits 385 W/m<sup>2</sup>, as shown by the <font color="green"><b>green line</b></font>, suddenly there are two possible temperatures: a cold one and a much hotter one.  When the insolation is higher, as shown by the <b>black line</b>, there are three possible temperatures: a cold one, and unstable intermediate one, and a hot one.  And when the insolation gets above 465 W/m<sup>2</sup>, as shown by the <font color="red"><b>red line</b></font>, there&#8217;s only a hot state! </p>
<p>Mathematically, this model illustrates catastrophe theory.  As we slowly turn up <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;gamma," class="latex" /> we get different curves showing how temperature is a function of insolation&#8230; until suddenly the curve isn&#8217;t the graph of a function anymore: it becomes infinitely steep at one point!  After that, we get bistability:</p>

<p>This is called a <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catastrophe_theory#Cusp_catastrophe">cusp catastrophe</a></b>, and you can visualize these curves as slices of a surface in 3d, which looks roughly like this picture:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CuspCatastrophe.html"><br />
<img border="none" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/cusp_catastrophe.jpg" /><br />
</a>
</div>
<p>from here:</p>
<p>&bull; Wolfram Mathworld, <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CuspCatastrophe.html">Cusp catastrophe</a>.  (Includes Mathematica package.)</p>
<p>The cusp catastrophe is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_stability">&#8216;structurally stable&#8217;</a>, meaning that small perturbations don&#8217;t change its qualitative behavior.  In other words, <i>whenever</i> you have a smooth graph of a function that gets steeper and steeper until it &#8216;overhangs&#8217; and ceases to be the graph of a function, it looks like this cusp catastrophe.   This statement is quite vague as I&#8217;ve just said it&#8212; but it&#8217;s made 100% precise in catastrophe theory.  </p>
<p>Structural stability is a useful concept, because it focuses our attention on <i>robust</i> features of models: features that don&#8217;t go away if the model is slightly wrong, as it always is.</p>
<p>There are lots more things to say, but the most urgent question to answer is this: why is the intermediate state unstable when it exists?  Why are the other two equilibria stable?  We&#8217;ll talk about that next time!</p>

<b>Abstract:</b> The International Mathematical Union has declared 2013 to be the year of <a href="http://mpe2013.org/">The Mathematics of Planet Earth</a>.  The global warming crisis is part of a bigger transformation in which humanity realizes that the Earth is a finite system and that our population, energy usage, and the like cannot continue to grow exponentially.  If civilization survives this transformation, it will affect mathematics&#8212;and be affected by it&#8212;just as dramatically as the agricultural revolution or industrial revolution.  We cannot know for sure what the effect will be, but we can already make some guesses.  </p></blockquote>

				<small>27 October, 2012</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>Earlier this week I gave a talk on the <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/planet/planet_usc.pdf">Mathematics of Planet Earth</a> at the University of Southern California, and someone there recommended that I look into John Harte&#8217;s work on maximum entropy methods in ecology.  He works at U.C. Berkeley.  </p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltobias/2011/08/29/climate-shock-uc-berkeley-scientist-dr-john-harte-puts-the-world-on-notice/"><img width="300" src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs-images.forbes.com/michaeltobias/files/2011/08/John-Harte1.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>I checked out <a href="http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~hartelab/">his website</a> and found that his goals resemble mine: save the planet and understand its ecosystems.  He&#8217;s a lot further along than I am, since he comes from a long background in ecology while I&#8217;ve just recently blundered in from mathematical physics.  I can&#8217;t really say what I think of his work since I&#8217;m just learning about it.  But I thought I should point out its existence.</p>
<p>This free book is something a lot of people would find interesting:</p>
<p>&bull; John and Mary Ellen Harte, <a href="http://www.cooltheearth.us/download.php"><i>Cool the Earth, Save the Economy: Solving the Climate Crisis Is EASY</i></a>, 2008.</p>
<p>EASY?  Well, it&#8217;s an acronym.  Here&#8217;s the basic idea of the US-based plan described in this book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any proposed energy policy should include these two components:</p>
<p>&bull; <b>Technical/Behavioral</b>: What resources and technologies are to be used to supply energy? On the demand side, what technologies and lifestyle changes are being proposed to consumers?</p>
<p>&bull; <b>Incentives/Economic Policy</b>: How are the desired supply and demand options to be encouraged or forced? Here the options include taxes, subsidies, regulations, permits, research and development, and education.</p>
<p>And a successful energy policy should satisfy the AAA criteria:</p>
<p>&bull; <b>Availability</b>. The climate crisis will rapidly become costly to society if we do not take action expeditiously. We need to adopt now those technologies that are currently available, provided they meet the following two additional criteria:</p>
<p>&bull; <b>Affordability</b>. Because of the central role of energy in our society, its cost to consumers should not increase significantly. In fact, a successful energy policy could ultimately save consumers money.</p>
<p>&bull; <b>Acceptability</b>. All energy strategies have environmental, land use, and health and safety implications; these must be acceptable to the public. Moreover, while some interest groups will undoubtedly oppose any particular energy policy, political acceptability at a broad scale is necessary.</p>
<p>Our strategy for preventing climate catastrophe and achieving energy independence includes:</p>
<p>&bull; <b>Energy Efficient Technology</b> at home and at the workplace. Huge reductions in home energy use can be achieved with available technologies, including more efficient appliances such as refrigerators, water heaters, and light bulbs. Home retrofits and new home design features such as “smart” window coatings, lighter-colored roofs where there are hot summers, better home insulation, and passive solar designs can also reduce energy use. Together, energy efficiency in home and industry can save the U.S. up to approximately half of the energy currently consumed in those sectors, and at no net cost&#8212;just by making different choices. Sounds good, doesn’t it?</p>
<p>&bull; <b>Automobile Fuel Efficiency</b>. Phase in higher Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards for automobiles, SUVs and light trucks by requiring vehicles to go 35 miles per gallon of gas (mpg) by 2015, 45 mpg by 2020, and 60 mpg by 2030. This would rapidly wipe out our dependence on foreign oil and cut emissions from the vehicle sector by two-thirds. A combination of plug-in hybrid, lighter car body materials, re-design and other innovations could readily achieve these standards. This sounds good, too!</p>
<p>&bull; <b>Solar and Wind Energy</b>. Rooftop photovoltaic panels and solar water heating units should be phased in over the next 20 years, with the goal of solar installation on 75% of U.S. homes and commercial buildings by 2030. (Not all roofs receive sufficient sunlight to make solar panels practical for them.) Large wind farms, solar photovoltaic stations, and solar thermal stations should also be phased in so that by 2030, all U.S. electricity demand will be supplied by existing hydroelectric, existing and possibly some new nuclear, and, most importantly, new solar and wind units. This will require investment in expansion of the grid to bring the new supply to the demand, and in research and development to improve overnight storage systems. Achieving this goal would reduce our dependence on coal to practically zero. More good news!</p>
<p>&bull; <b>You</b> are part of the answer. Voting wisely for leaders who promote the first three components is one of the most important individual actions one can make. Other actions help, too. Just as molecules make up mountains, individual actions taken collectively have huge impacts. Improved driving skills, automobile maintenance, reusing and recycling, walking and biking, wearing sweaters in winter and light clothing in summer, installing timers on thermostats and insulating houses, carpooling, paying attention to energy efficiency labels on appliances, and many other simple practices and behaviors hugely influence energy consumption. A major education campaign, both in schools for youngsters and by the media for everyone, should be mounted to promote these consumer practices.</p>
<p>No part of EASY can be left out; all parts are closely integrated. Some parts might create much larger changes&#8212;for example, more efficient home appliances and automobiles&#8212;but all parts are essential. If, for example, we do not achieve the decrease in electricity demand that can be brought about with the E of EASY, then it is extremely doubtful that we could meet our electricity needs with the S of EASY.</p>
<p>It is equally urgent that once we start implementing the plan, we aggressively export it to other major emitting nations. We can reduce our own emissions all we want, but the planet will continue to warm if we can’t convince other major global emitters to reduce their emissions substantially, too.</p>
<p><b>What EASY will achieve.</b> If no actions are taken to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, in the year 2030 the U.S. will be emitting about 2.2 billion tons of carbon in the form of carbon dioxide. This will be an increase of 25% from today’s emission rate of about 1.75 billion tons per year of carbon. By following the EASY plan, the U.S. share in a global effort to solve the climate crisis (that is, prevent catastrophic warming) will result in U.S emissions of only about 0.4 billion tons of carbon by 2030, which represents a little less than 25% of 2007 carbon dioxide emissions.128 Stated differently, the plan provides a way to eliminate 1.8 billion tons per year of carbon by that date.</p>
<p>We must act urgently: in the 14 months it took us to write this book, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels rose by several billion tons of carbon, and more climatic consequences have been observed. Let’s assume that we conserve our forests and other natural carbon reservoirs at our current levels, as well as maintain our current nuclear and hydroelectric plants (or replace them with more solar and wind generators). Here’s what implementing EASY will achieve, as illustrated by Figure 3.1 on the next page.

However, the abstract is visible to all, and of course I can use my academic superpowers to get ahold of the paper for myself:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<b>Abstract</b>: The biodiversity scaling metrics widely studied in macroecology include the species-area relationship (SAR), the scale-dependent species-abundance distribution (SAD), the distribution of masses or metabolic energies of individuals within and across species, the abundance-energy or abundance-mass relationship across species, and the species-level occupancy distributions across space. We propose a theoretical framework for predicting the scaling forms of these and other metrics based on the state-variable concept and an analytical method derived from information theory. In statistical physics, a method of inference based on information entropy results in a complete macro-scale description of classical thermodynamic systems in terms of the state variables volume, temperature, and number of molecules. In analogy, we take the state variables of an ecosystem to be its total area, the total number of species within any specified taxonomic group in that area, the total number of individuals across those species, and the summed metabolic energy rate for all those individuals. In terms solely of ratios of those state variables, and without invoking any specific ecological mechanisms, we show that realistic functional forms for the macroecological metrics listed above are inferred based on information entropy. The Fisher log series SAD emerges naturally from the theory. The SAR is predicted to have negative curvature on a log-log plot, but as the ratio of the number of species to the number of individuals decreases, the SAR becomes better and better approximated by a power law, with the predicted slope z in the range of 0.14-0.20. Using the 3/4 power mass-metabolism scaling relation to relate energy requirements and measured body sizes, the Damuth scaling rule relating mass and abundance is also predicted by the theory. We argue that the predicted forms of the macroecological metrics are in reasonable agreement with the patterns observed from plant census data across habitats and spatial scales. While this is encouraging, given the absence of adjustable fitting parameters in the theory, we further argue that even small discrepancies between data and predictions can help identify ecological mechanisms that influence macroecological patterns.

				<div class="entry">
					<p>We&#8217;ve <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/10/13/mathematics-of-the-environment-part-3/">been looking</a> at some very simple models of the Earth&#8217;s climate.  Pretty soon I want to show you one that illustrates the <b>ice albedo effect</b>.  This effect says that when it&#8217;s colder, there&#8217;s more ice and snow, so the Earth gets lighter in color, so it reflects more sunlight and tends to get even colder.  In other words, it&#8217;s a <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_feedback">positive feedback</a></b> mechanism: a reaction that strengthens the process that caused the reaction. </p>
<p>Since a higher temperature leads to a higher radiation and therefore to cooling, and a lower temperature leads to a lower radiation, according to the Planck distribution, there is always also a <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_feedback">negative feedback</a></b> present in the climate system of the earth. This is dubbed the <b>Planck feedback</b>, and this is what ultimately protects the Earth against getting arbitrarily hot or cold.</p>
<p>However, the ice albedo effect may be important for the &#8216;ice ages&#8217; or more properly &#8216;glacial cycles&#8217; that we&#8217;ve been having for the last few ten million years&#8230; and also for much earlier, much colder <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowball_Earth">Snowball Earth</a> events.  In reverse, melting ice now tends to make the Earth darker and even warmer.  So, this is an interesting topic for many reasons&#8230; including the math, which we&#8217;ll get to later.</p>
<p>Now, obviously the dinosaurs did not keep records of the temperature, so how we estimate temperatures on the ancient Earth is an important question, which deserves a long discussion&#8212;but not today!  Today I&#8217;ll be fairly sketchy about that.  I just want you to get a feel for the overall story, and some open questions.</p>
<h3> The Earth&#8217;s temperature since the last glacial period </h3>
<p>First, here&#8217;s a graph of Greenland temperatures over the last 18,000 years:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature/greenland.18kyr.gif"><img width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature/greenland.18kyr.gif" /></a></div>
<p>(As usual, click to enlarge and/or get more information.)   This chart is based on ice cores, taken from:</p>
<p>&bull; Richard B. Alley, <em>The Two-Mile Time Machine: Ice Cores, Abrupt Climate Change, and our Future</em>, Princeton U. Press, Princeton, 2002.</p>
<p>This is a good book for learning how people reconstruct the<br />
history of temperatures in Greenland from looking at a two-mile-long ice core drilled out of the glaciers there.</p>
<p>As you can see, first Greenland was very cold, and then it warmed up at the end of the last &#8216;ice age&#8217;, or glacial period.  But there are lot of other things to see in this graph.  For example, there was a severe cold spell between 12.9 and 11.5 thousand years ago: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Younger_Dryas"><b>Younger Dryas</b></a> event.</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dryas_octopetala"><img width="350" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/Mountainavens2.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>I love that name!   It comes from the tough little Arctic flower<br />
<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dryas_octopetala">Dryas octopetala</a></em>, whose plentiful pollen in certain ice samples gave evidence that this time period was chilly.    Was there an Older Dryas?  Yes: before the Younger Dryas there was a warm spell called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aller%C3%B8d_Oscillation">Aller&oslash;d</a>, and before that a cold period called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Older_Dryas">Older Dryas</a>.</p>
<p>The Younger Dryas lasted about 1400 years.  Temperatures dropped dramatically in Europe: about 7 &deg;C in only 20 years!   In Greenland, it was 15 &deg;C colder during the Younger Dryas than today.  In England, the average annual temperature was -5 &deg;C, so glaciers started forming.  We can see evidence of this event from <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature/temperature.html#greenland.20kyr">oxygen isotope records</a> and <a href="http://www.agu.org/revgeophys/mayews01/node6.html">many other things</a>.  </p>
<p>Why the sudden chill?  One popular theory is that the melting of the ice sheet on North America lowered the salinity of North Atlantic waters.  This in turn blocked a current called the<br />
<a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/AMOC">Atlantic meridional overturning circulation</a>, or AMOC for short, which normally brings warm water up the coast of Europe.   Proponents of this theory argue that this current is what makes London much warmer than, say, Winnipeg in Canada or Irkutsk in Russia.  Turn it off and&mdash;<em>wham!</em>&mdash;you&#8217;ll get glaciers forming in England.</p>
<p>Anyway, whatever caused it, the Younger Dryas ended as suddenly at it began, with temperatures jumping 7 &deg;C.   Since then, the Earth continued warming up until about 6 thousand years ago&#8212;the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_climatic_optimum">mid-Holocene thermal maximum</a>.   The earth was about 1&deg; or 2&deg; Celsius warmer than today.  Since then, it&#8217;s basically been cooling off&#8212;not counting various smaller variations, like the global warming we&#8217;re experiencing in this century.</p>
<p>However, these smaller variations are very interesting!  From 6000 to 2500 years ago things cooled down, with the coolest<br />
stretch occurring between 4000 and 2500 years ago: the <a HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Age_Cold_Epoch"><b>Iron Age Cold Epoch</b></a>.  </p>
<p>Then things warmed up for a while, and then they cooled down<br />
from 500 to 1000 AD.  Yes, the so-called &quot;Dark Ages&quot; were also chilly!  </p>
<p>After this came the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Warm_Period"><b>Medieval Warm Period</b></a>, a period from about 1000 to 1300 AD:  </p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://www.globalwarmingart.com/wiki/File:2000_Year_Temperature_Comparison_png"><img width="450" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/2000_Year_Temperature_Comparison.png" /></a></div>
<p>From 1450 AD to 1890 there was a period of cooling, often called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Ice_Age"><b>Little Ice Age</b></a>.  This killed off the Icelandic colonies in Greenland, as described in this gripping book:</p>
<p>&bull; Jane Smiley, <em>The Greenlanders</em>, Ballantine Books, New York, 1996. </p>
<p>However, the term &quot;Little Ice Age&quot; exaggerates the importance of a small blip in the grand scheme of things.  It was nowhere near as big as the Younger Dryas: temperatures may have dropped a measly 0.2&deg; Celsius from the Medieval optimum, and it may have happened only in Europe&#8212;though this was a subject of debate when I last checked.</p>
<p>Since then, things have been warming up:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://www.globalwarmingart.com/wiki/File:1000_Year_Temperature_Comparison_png"><img width="450" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/1000_Year_Temperature_Comparison.png" /></a></div>
<p>The subject has big political implications, and is thus subject to enormous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature_record_of_the_past_1000_years">controversy</a>. But, I think it&#8217;s quite safe to say that we&#8217;ve been seeing a rapid temperature rise since 1900, with the Northern Hemisphere average temperature rising roughly 1 &deg;C since then.  Each of the last 11 years, from 2001 to 2011, was one of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_temperature_record#Warmest_years">12 warmest years since 1901</a>.  (The other one was 1998.)</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:Instrumental_Temperature_Record_%28NASA%29.svg&amp;page=1"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Instrumental_Temperature_Record_%28NASA%29.svg/450px-Instrumental_Temperature_Record_%28NASA%29.svg.png" /></a></div>
<p>All these recent variations in the Earth&#8217;s climate are very much worth trying to understand.   but now let&#8217;s back off to longer time periods!  We don&#8217;t have many Earth-like planets whose climate we can study in detail&#8212;at least not yet, since they&#8217;re too far away.  But we do have one planet, the Earth, that&#8217;s gone through many changes.  The climate since the end of the last ice age is just a tiny sliver of a long and exciting story!</p>
<h3> The Earth&#8217;s long-term climate history </h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s a nice old chart showing estimates of the Earth&#8217;s average temperature in the last 150 years, the last 16,000 years, the last 150,000 years and the last million years:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature/1Myr.jpg"><img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature/1Myr.jpg" /><br />
</a></div>
<p>Here &#8220;ka&#8221; or &#8220;kilo-annum&#8221; means a thousand years.  These temperatures are estimated by various methods; I got this chart from:</p>
<p>&bull; Barry Saltzman, <i>Dynamical Paleoclimatology: Generalized Theory of Global Climate Change</i>, Academic Press, New York, 2002, fig. 3-4. </p>
<p>As we keep zooming in towards the present we keep seeing more detail:</p>
<p>&bull; Over the last million years there have been about ten glacial periods&#8212;though trying to count them is a bit like trying to count &#8216;very deep valleys&#8217; in a hilly landscape!</p>
<p>&bull; From 150 to 120 thousand years ago it warmed up rather rapidly. From 120 thousand years ago to 16 thousand years ago it cooled down&#8212;that was the last glacial period. Then it warmed up rather rapidly again.</p>
<p>&bull; Over the last 10 thousand years temperatures have been unusually constant.</p>
<p>&bull; Over the last 150 years it&#8217;s been warming up slightly. </p>
<p>If we go back further, say to 5 million years, we see that temperatures have been colder but also more erratic during this period:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://www.globalwarmingart.com/wiki/File:Five_Myr_Climate_Change_Rev_png"><img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature/5Myr.png" /></a></div>
<p>This figure is based on this paper:</p>
<p>&bull; L. E. Lisiecki and M. E. Raymo, A Pliocene-Pleistocene stack of 57 globally distributed benthic &delta;<sup>18</sup>O records, <i><a href="http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2005/2004PA001071.shtml">Paleoceanography</a></i> <b>20</b> (2005), PA1003. </p>
<p>Lisieki and Raymo combined measurements of oxygen isotopes in the shells of tiny sea creatures called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foraminifera">foraminifera</a> from 57 globally distributed deep sea sediment cores.  But beware: they constructed this record by first applying a computer aided process to align the data in each sediment core.  Then the resulting stacked record was tuned to make the positions of peaks and valleys match the known <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles">Milankovitch cycles</a> in the Earth&#8217;s orbit.  The temperature scale was chosen to match <a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/icecore/antarctica/vostok/vostok.html">Vostok ice core data</a>.  So, there are a lot of theoretical assumptions built into this graph.</p>
<p>Going back 65 million years, we see how unusual the current glacial cycles are:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature/65Myr.png"><img width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature/65Myr.png" /><br />
</a></div>
<p>Click to make this graph bigger; it&#8217;s from:</p>
<p>&bull; Robert Rohde, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:65_Myr_Climate_Change.png">65 million years of climate change</a>, at <a href="http://www.globalwarmingart.com/">Global Warming Art</a>.</p>
<p>This graph shows the Earth&#8217;s temperature since the extinction of the dinosaurs about 65 million years ago&mdash;the end of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a> and beginning of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cenozoic">Cenozoic</a>.  At first the Earth warmed up, reaching its warmest  50 million years ago: the &quot;Eocene Optimum&quot;. The spike before that labelled &quot;PETM&quot; is a fascinating event called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleocene-Eocene_Thermal_Maximum"> Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum</a>.   At the end of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eocene">Eocene</a> the Earth cooled rapidly and the Antarctic acquired year-round ice. After a warming spell near the end of the  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eocene">Oligocene</a>, further cooling and an increasingly jittery climate led ultimately to the current age of rapid glacial cycles.  </p>
<p>Why is the Earth&#8217;s climate so jittery nowadays?  That&#8217;s a fascinating puzzle, which I&#8217;d like to discuss in the weeks to come.  </p>
<p>Why did the Earth suddenly cool at the end of the Eocene 34 million years ago?  One theory relies on the fact that this is when Antarctica first became separated from Australia and South America.  After the <a href="http://a.ennyu.com/pdf/Exon_JoiJour_00.pdf">Tasmanian Gateway</a> between Australia and Antarctica opened, the only thing that kept water from swirling endlessly around Antarctica, getting colder and colder, was the connection between this continent and South America.  South America seems to have separated from Antarctica around the end of the Eocene. </p>
<p>In the early Eocene, Antarctica was fringed with a warm temperate to sub-tropical rainforest.  But as the Eocene progressed it became colder, and by the start of the Oligocene it had deciduous forests and vast stretches of tundra.  Eventually it became almost completely covered with ice.</p>
<p>Thanks to the ice albedo effect, an icy Antarctic tends to keep the Earth cooler.  But is that the only or even the <i>main</i> explanation of the overall cooling trend over the last 30 million years?  Scientists argue about this.</p>
<p>Going back further:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature/4600Myr.jpg"><img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature/4600Myr.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>Here &quot;Ma&quot; or &quot;mega-annum&quot; means &quot;million years&quot;.   This chart was drawn from many sources; I got it from: </p>
<p>&bull; Barry Saltzman, <em>Dynamical Paleoclimatology: Generalized Theory of Global Climate Change</em>, Academic Press, New York, 2002, fig. 1-3. </p>
<p>Among other things on this chart, you can sort of see hints of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowball_Earth">Snowball Earth</a> events that may have happened early in the Earth&#8217;s history.  These are thought to have occurred during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryogenian">Cryogenian period</a> 850 to 635 million years ago, and also during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huronian_glaciation">Huronian glaciation</a> 2400 to 2100 million years ago.  In both these events a large portion of the Earth was frozen&#8212;much more, it seems, than in the recent glacial periods!  Ice albedo feedback plays a big role in theories of these events&#8230; though also, of course, there must be some explanation of why they <i>ended</i>.</p>
<p>As you can see, there&#8217;s a lot of things a really universal climate model might seek to explain.  We don&#8217;t <i>necessarily</i> need to understand the whole Earth&#8217;s history to model it well <i>now</i>, but thinking about other eras is a good way to check our understanding of the present-day Earth.</p>

					<p>This week I&#8217;ll release these notes <i>before</i> my seminar, so my students (and all of you, too) can read them ahead of time.  The reason is that I&#8217;m pushing into topics I don&#8217;t understand as well as I&#8217;d like.  So, my notes wrestle with some ideas in too much detail to cover in class&#8212;and I&#8217;m hoping some students will look at these notes ahead of time to prepare.  Also, I&#8217;d appreciate your comments!</p>
<p>This week I&#8217;ll borrow material shamelessly from here:</p>
<p>&bull; Seymour L. Hess, <i>Introduction to Theoretical Meteorology</i>, Henry Holt and Company, New York, 1959.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an old book: for example, it talks about working out the area under a curve using a gadget called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planimeter">planimeter</a>, which is what people did before computers.</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planimeter"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Polarplanimeter_01.JPG/320px-Polarplanimeter_01.JPG" /></a></div>
<p>It also talks about how people measured the solar constant (roughly, the brightness of the Sun) before we could easily put satellites up above the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere!   And it doesn&#8217;t mention global warming.  </p>
<p>But despite or perhaps even because of these quaint features, it&#8217;s simple and clear.  In case it&#8217;s not obvious yet, I&#8217;m teaching this quarter&#8217;s seminar in order to learn stuff.  So, I&#8217;ll sometimes talk about old work&#8230; but if you catch me saying things that are seriously wrong (as opposed to merely primitive), please let me know.</p>
<h3> The plan </h3>
<p>Last time we considered a simple model Earth, a blackbody at uniform constant temperature absorbing sunlight and re-emitting the same amount of power in the form of blackbody radiation.  We worked out that its temperature would be 6 &deg;C, which is not bad.  But then we took into account the fact that the Earth is not black.  We got a temperature of -18 &deg;C, which is too cold.  The reason is that we haven&#8217;t yet equipped our model Earth with an atmosphere!  So today let&#8217;s try that.</p>
<p>At this point things get a lot more complicated, even if we try a 1-dimensional model where the temperature, pressure and other features of the atmosphere only depend on altitude.  So, I&#8217;ll only do what I can easily do. I&#8217;ll explain some basic laws governing radiation, and then sketch how people applied them to the Earth.</p>
<p>It&#8217;ll be good to start with a comment about what we did last time.</p>
<h3> Kirchoff&#8217;s law of radiation </h3>
<p>When we admitted the Earth wasn&#8217;t black, we said that it <i>absorbed</i> only about 70% of the radiation hitting it&#8230; but we still modeled it as <i>emitting</i> radiation just like a blackbody!  Isn&#8217;t there something fishy about this?   </p>
<p>Well, no.  The Earth is mainly absorbing sunlight at visible frequencies, and at these frequencies it only absorbs about 70% of the radiation that hits it.  But it mainly emits infrared light, and at these frequencies it acts like it&#8217;s almost black.  These frequencies are almost completely different from those where absorption occurs.</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ecological/earth_and_sun_emission.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p>But still, this issue is worth thinking about.</p>
<p>After all, emission and absorption are flip sides of the same coin.  There&#8217;s a deep principle in physics, called <b>reciprocity</b>, which says that how X affects Y is not a separate question from how Y affects X.  In fact, if you know the answer to one of these questions, you can figure out the answer to the other!</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion#Newton.27s_third_law"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Skaters_showing_newtons_third_law.svg/300px-Skaters_showing_newtons_third_law.svg.png" /></a></div>
<p>The first place most people see this principle is Newton&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion#Newton.27s_third_law">third law of classical mechanics</a>, saying that if X exerts a force on Y, Y exerts an equal and opposite force on X.  </p>
<p>For example: if I punched your nose, your nose punched my fist just as hard, so you have no right to complain.  <img src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/emoticons/grumpy.gif" />   </p>
<p>This law is still often stated in its old-fashioned form:</p>
<blockquote><p>
For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I found this confusing as a student, because &#8216;force&#8217; was part of the formal terminology of classical mechanics, but not &#8216;action&#8217;&#8212;at least not as used in this sentence!&#8212;and certainly not &#8216;reaction&#8217;.   But as a statement of the basic intuition behind reciprocity, it&#8217;s got a certain charm.  </p>
<p>In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocity_%28engineering%29">engineering</a>, the principle of reciprocity is sometimes stated like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Reciprocity in linear systems is the principle that the response <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R_%7Bab%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="R_{ab}" class="latex" /> measured at a location <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a" class="latex" /> when the system is excited at a location <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="b" class="latex" /> is exactly equal to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R_%7Bba%7D%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="R_{ba}," class="latex" /> which is the response at location <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="b" class="latex" /> when that same excitation is applied at <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a." class="latex" />  This applies for all frequencies of the excitation.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Again this is a bit confusing, at least if you&#8217;re a mathematician who would like to know exactly how a &#8216;response&#8217; or an &#8216;excitation&#8217; is defined.  It&#8217;s also disappointing to see the principle stated in a way that limits it to linear systems.  Nonetheless it&#8217;s tremendously inspiring.  <i>What&#8217;s really going on here?</i>   </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t claim to have gotten to the bottom of it.   My hunch is that to a large extent it will come down to the fact that mixed partial derivatives commute.  If we&#8217;ve got a smooth function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" /> of a bunch of variables <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+x_n%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x_1, &#92;dots, x_n," class="latex" /> and we set</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+R_%7Bab%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial%5E2+f%7D%7B%5Cpartial+x_a+%5Cpartial+x_b%7D+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ R_{ab} = &#92;frac{&#92;partial^2 f}{&#92;partial x_a &#92;partial x_b} } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>then </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R_%7Bab%7D+%3D+R_%7Bba%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="R_{ab} = R_{ba} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>However, I haven&#8217;t gotten around to showing that reciprocity boils down to this in all the examples yet.  Yet another unification project to add to my list!</p>
<p>Anyway: reciprocity has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocity_%28electromagnetism%29">lots of interesting applications to electromagnetism</a>.   And that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re really talking about now.  After all, light is electromagnetic radiation!  </p>
<p>The simplest application is one we learn as children: </p>
<blockquote><p>
If I can see you, then you can see me.
</p></blockquote>
<p>or at least:</p>
<blockquote><p>
If light can go from X to Y in a static environment, it can also go from Y to X.
</p></blockquote>
<p>But we want something that sounds a bit different.  Namely: </p>
<blockquote><p>
The tendency of a substance to <i>absorb</i> light at some frequency equals its tendency to <i>emit</i> light at that frequency.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is too vague.  We should make it precise, and in a minute I&#8217;ll try, but first let me motivate this idea with a thought experiment.  Suppose we have a black rock and a white rock in a sealed mirrored container.  Suppose they&#8217;re in thermal equilibrium at a very high temperature, so they&#8217;re glowing red-hot.  So, there&#8217;s red light bouncing around the container.   The black rock will absorb more of this light.  But since they&#8217;re in thermal equilibrium, the black rock must also be <i>emitting</i> more of this light, or it would gain energy and get hotter than the white one.  That would violate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeroth_law_of_thermodynamics">zeroth law of thermodynamics</a>, which implies that in thermal equilibrium, all the parts of a system must be at the same temperature.</p>
<p>More precisely, we have:</p>
<p><b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchhoff%27s_law_of_thermal_radiation">Kirchoff&#8217;s Law of Thermal Radiation</a>.</b>  For any body in thermal equilibrium, its emissivity equals its absorptivity.</p>
<p>Let me explain.  Suppose we have a surface made of some homogeneous isotropic material in thermal equilibrium at temperature <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T." class="latex" />  If it&#8217;s perfectly black, we saw <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/10/11/mathematics-of-the-environment-part-2/">last time</a> that it emits light with a monochromatic energy flux given by the <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_law">Planck distribution</a></b>:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+f_%7B%5Clambda%7D%28T%29+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B2+hc%5E2%7D%7B%5Clambda%5E5%7D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B+e%5E%7B%5Cfrac%7Bhc%7D%7B%5Clambda+k+T%7D%7D+-+1+%7D+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ f_{&#92;lambda}(T) = &#92;frac{2 hc^2}{&#92;lambda^5} &#92;frac{1}{ e^{&#92;frac{hc}{&#92;lambda k T}} - 1 } } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Here <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;lambda" class="latex" /> is the wavelength of light and the &#8216;monochromatic energy flux&#8217; has units of power per area per wavelength.</p>
<p>But if our surface is not perfectly black, we have to multiply this by a fudge factor between 0 and 1 to get the right answer.  This factor is called the <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emissivity">emissivity</a></b> of the substance.  It can depend on the wavelength of the light quite a lot, and also on the surface&#8217;s temperature (since for example ice melts at high temperatures and gets darker).  So, let&#8217;s call it <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e_%5Clambda%28T%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="e_&#92;lambda(T)." class="latex" /></p>
<p>We can also talk about the <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorbance">absorptivity</a></b> of our surface, which is the fraction of light it absorbs.  Again this depends on the wavelength of the light and the temperature of our surface.  So, let&#8217;s call it <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_%5Clambda%28T%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a_&#92;lambda(T)." class="latex" /></p>
<p>Then Kirchoff&#8217;s law of thermal radiation says</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e_%5Clambda%28T%29+%3D+a_%5Clambda%28T%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="e_&#92;lambda(T) = a_&#92;lambda(T) " class="latex" /></p>
<p>So, for each frequency the emissivity must equal the absorptivity&#8230; but it&#8217;s still possible for the Earth to have an average emissivity near 1 at the wavelengths of infrared light and near 0.7 at the wavelengths of visible light.  So there&#8217;s no paradox.</p>
<p><b>Puzzle 1.</b>  Is this law named after the same guy who discovered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchhoff%27s_circuit_laws">Kirchhoff&#8217;s laws</a> governing electrical circuits?</p>
<h3> Schwarzschild&#8217;s equation </h3>
<p>Now let&#8217;s talk about light shining through the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere.   Or more generally, light shining through a medium.   What happens?  It can get absorbed.  It can get scattered, bouncing off in different directions.  Light can also get <i>emitted</i>, especially if the medium is hot.  The air in our atmosphere isn&#8217;t hot enough to emit a lot of visible light, but it definitely emits infrared light and microwaves.</p>
<p>It sounds complicated, and it is, but there are things we can say about it.  Let me tell you about Schwarzschild&#8217;s equation.</p>
<p>Light comes in different wavelengths.  So, can ask how much power per square meter this light carries per wavelength.   We call this the <b>monochromatic energy flux</b> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I_%7B%5Clambda%7D%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="I_{&#92;lambda}," class="latex" /> since it depends on the wavelength <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;lambda." class="latex" />   As mentioned <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/10/11/mathematics-of-the-environment-part-2/">last time</a>, this has units W/m<sup>2</sup>μm, where μm stands for micrometers, a unit of wavelength.   </p>
<p>However, because light gets absorbed, scattered and emitted the monochromatic energy flux is really a function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I_%7B%5Clambda%7D%28s%29%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="I_{&#92;lambda}(s)," class="latex" /> where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="s" class="latex" /> is the distance through the medium.  Here I&#8217;m imagining an essentially one-dimensional situation, like a beam of sunlight coming down through the air when the Sun is directly overhead.  We can generalize this later.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s figure out the basic equation describing how <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I_%7B%5Clambda%7D%28s%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="I_{&#92;lambda}(s)" class="latex" /> changes as a function of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="s." class="latex" />  This is called the <a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiative_transfer"><b>equation of radiative transfer</b></a>, or <b>Schwarzschild&#8217;s equation</b>.  It won&#8217;t tell us how different gases absorb different amounts of light of different frequencies&#8212;for that we need to do hard calculations, or experiments.  But we can feed the results of these calculations into Schwarzschild&#8217;s equation.</p>
<p>For starters, let&#8217;s assume that light only gets absorbed but not emitted or scattered.  Later we&#8217;ll include emission, which is very important for what we&#8217;re doing: the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere is warm enough to emit significant amounts of infrared light (though not hot enough to emit much visible light).  Scattering is also very important, but it can be treated as a combination of absorption and emission.</p>
<p>For absorption only, we have the <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer%E2%80%93Lambert_law">Beer&#8211;Lambert law</a></b>:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B++%5Cfrac%7Bd+I_%5Clambda%28s%29%7D%7Bd+s%7D+%3D+-+a_%5Clambda%28s%29+I_%5Clambda%28s%29++%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{  &#92;frac{d I_&#92;lambda(s)}{d s} = - a_&#92;lambda(s) I_&#92;lambda(s)  }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>In other words, the amount of radiation that gets absorbed per distance is proportional to the amount of radiation.  However, the constant of proportionality <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_%5Clambda+%28s%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a_&#92;lambda (s)" class="latex" /> can depend on the frequency and the details of our medium at the position <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="s." class="latex" />   I don&#8217;t know the standard name for this constant <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_%5Clambda+%28s%29%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a_&#92;lambda (s)," class="latex" /> so let&#8217;s call it the <b>absorption rate</b>.  </p>
<p><b>Puzzle 2.</b>  Assuming the Beer&#8211;Lambert law, show that the intensity of light at two positions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s_1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="s_1" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s_2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="s_2" class="latex" /> is related by</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+I_%5Clambda%28s_2%29+%3D+e%5E%7B-%5Ctau%7D+%5C%3B+I_%5Clambda%28s_1%29+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ I_&#92;lambda(s_2) = e^{-&#92;tau} &#92;; I_&#92;lambda(s_1) } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>where the <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_depth">optical depth</a></b> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;tau" class="latex" /> of the intervening medium is defined by</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Ctau+%3D+%5Cint_%7Bs_1%7D%5E%7Bs_2%7D+a_%5Clambda%28s%29+%5C%2C+ds+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;tau = &#92;int_{s_1}^{s_2} a_&#92;lambda(s) &#92;, ds } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>So, a layer of stuff has optical depth equal to 1 if light shining through it has its intensity reduced by a factor of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2Fe.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="1/e." class="latex" />  </p>
<p>We can go a bit further if our medium is a rather thin gas like the air in our atmosphere.  Then the absorption rate is given by</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_%5Clambda%28s%29+%3D+k_%5Clambda%28s%29+%5C%2C+%5Crho%28s%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a_&#92;lambda(s) = k_&#92;lambda(s) &#92;, &#92;rho(s) " class="latex" /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho%28s%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;rho(s)" class="latex" /> is the density of the air at the position <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="s" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k_%5Clambda%28s%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k_&#92;lambda(s)" class="latex" /> is its <b>absorption coefficient</b>.   </p>
<p>In other words, air absorbs light at a rate proportional to its density, but also depending on what it&#8217;s made of, which may vary with position.  For example, both the density and the humidity of the atmosphere can depend on its altitude.</p>
<p>What about emission?  Air doesn&#8217;t just absorb infrared light, it also emits significant amounts of it!   As mentioned, a blackbody at temperature <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T" class="latex" /> emits light with a monochromatic energy flux given by the <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_law">Planck distribution</a></b>:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+f_%7B%5Clambda%7D%28T%29+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B2+hc%5E2%7D%7B%5Clambda%5E5%7D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B+e%5E%7B%5Cfrac%7Bhc%7D%7B%5Clambda+k+T%7D%7D+-+1+%7D+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ f_{&#92;lambda}(T) = &#92;frac{2 hc^2}{&#92;lambda^5} &#92;frac{1}{ e^{&#92;frac{hc}{&#92;lambda k T}} - 1 } } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>But a gas like air is far from a blackbody, so we have to multiply this by a fudge factor.  Luckily, thanks to Kirchoff&#8217;s law of radiation, this factor isn&#8217;t so fudgy: it&#8217;s just the absorption rate <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_%5Clambda%28s%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a_&#92;lambda(s)." class="latex" /> </p>
<p>Here are we generalizing Kirchoff&#8217;s law from a surface to a column of air, but that&#8217;s okay because we can treat a column as a stack of surfaces; letting these become very thin we arrive at a differential formulation of the law that applies to absorption and emission rates instead of absorptivity and emissivity.  (If you&#8217;re very sharp, you&#8217;ll remember that Kirchoff&#8217;s law applies to thermal equilibrium, and wonder about that.  Air in the atmosphere isn&#8217;t in perfect thermal equilibrium, but it&#8217;s close enough for what we&#8217;re doing here.)</p>
<p>So, when we take absorption <i>and also emission</i> into account, Beer&#8217;s law gets another term:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B++%5Cfrac%7Bd+I_%5Clambda%28s%29%7D%7Bd+s%7D+%3D+-+a_%5Clambda%28s%29+I_%5Clambda%28s%29+%2B+a_%5Clambda%28s%29+f_%5Clambda%28T%28s%29%29+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{  &#92;frac{d I_&#92;lambda(s)}{d s} = - a_&#92;lambda(s) I_&#92;lambda(s) + a_&#92;lambda(s) f_&#92;lambda(T(s)) }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T" class="latex" /> is the temperature of our gas at the position <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="s." class="latex" />  In other words:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B++%5Cfrac%7Bd+I_%5Clambda%28s%29%7D%7Bd+s%7D+%3D++a_%5Clambda%28s%29+%28+f_%5Clambda%28T%29+-+I_%5Clambda%28s%29%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{  &#92;frac{d I_&#92;lambda(s)}{d s} =  a_&#92;lambda(s) ( f_&#92;lambda(T) - I_&#92;lambda(s))}" class="latex" /></p>
<p>This is <b>Schwarzschild&#8217;s equation</b>.</p>
<p><b>Puzzle 3.</b>  Is this equation named after the same guy who discovered the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_metric">Schwarzschild metric</a> in general relativity, describing a spherically symmetric black hole?</p>
<h3> Application to the atmosphere </h3>
<p>In principle, we can use Schwarzschild&#8217;s equation to help work out how much sunlight of any frequency actually makes it through the atmosphere down to the Earth, and also how much infrared radiation makes it through the atmosphere out to space.  But this is not a calculation I can do here today, because it&#8217;s very complicated.</p>
<p>If we actually measure what fraction of radiation of different frequencies makes it through the atmosphere, you&#8217;ll see why:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Atmospheric_Transmission.png"><br />
<img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ecological/atmospheric_transmission.png" /></a>
</div>
<p>Everything here is a function of the wavelength, measured in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micrometre">micrometers</a>.    The smooth red curve is the Planck distribution for light coming from the Sun at a temperature of 5325 K.  Most of it is visible light, with a wavelength between 0.4 and 0.7 micrometers.  The jagged red region shows how much of this gets through&#8212;on a clear day, I assume&#8212;and you can see that most of it gets through.   The smooth bluish curves are the Planck distributions for light coming from the Earth at various temperatures between 210 K and 310 K.  Most of it is infrared light, and not much of it gets through.  </p>
<p><i>This, in a nutshell, is what keeps the Earth warmer than the chilly -18 &deg;C we got last time for an Earth with no atmosphere!</i>  </p>
<p>This is the <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect">greenhouse effect</a></b>.  As you can see, the absorption of infrared light is mainly due to water vapor, and then carbon dioxide, and then other lesser greenhouse gases, mainly methane, nitrous oxide.   Oxygen and ozone also play a minor role, but ozone is more important in blocking ultraviolet light.  Rayleigh scattering&#8212;the scattering of light by small particles, including molecules and atoms&#8212;is also important at short wavelengths, because its strength is proportional to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2F%5Clambda%5E4.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="1/&#92;lambda^4." class="latex" />  This is why the sky is blue!</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering"><img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ecological/rayleigh_sunlight_scattering.png" /></a></div>
<p>Here the wavelengths are measured in nanometers; there are 1000 nanometers in a micrometer.  Rayleigh scattering continues to become more important in the ultraviolet.</p>
<p>But right now I want to talk about the infrared.  As you can see, the all-important absorption of infrared radiation by water vapor and carbon dioxide is quite complicated.  You need quantum mechanics to predict how this works from first principles.  Tim van Beek gave a gentle introduction to some of the key ideas here:</p>
<p>&bull; Tim van Beek, <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/07/02/a-quantum-of-warmth/">A quantum of warmth</a>, Azimuth, 2 July 2011.</p>
<p>Someday it would be fun to get into the details.  Not today, though!</p>
<p>You can see what&#8217;s going on a bit more clearly here:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Atmosfaerisk_spredning.gif"><br />
<img width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ecological/atmospheric_transmission.gif" /></a>
</div>
<p>The key fact is that infrared is almost completely absorbed for wavelengths between 5.5 and 7 micrometers, or over 14 micrometers.  (A &#8216;micron&#8217; is just an old name for a micrometer.)</p>
<h3> The work of Simpson </h3>
<p>The first person to give a reasonably successful explanation of how the power of radiation emitted by the Earth balances the power of the sunlight it absorbs was George Simpson.  He did it in 1928:</p>
<p>&bull; George C. Simpson, <a href="http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/056/mwr-056-08-0322.pdf">Further studies in terrestrial radiation</a>, <i>Mem. Roy. Meteor. Soc.</i> <b>3</b> (1928), 1&#8211;26. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.aos.princeton.edu/WWWPUBLIC/gkv/history/Simpson-studies27.pdf">One year earlier</a>, he had tried and failed to understand this problem using a &#8216;gray atmosphere&#8217; model where the fraction of light that gets through was independent of its wavelength.  If you&#8217;ve been paying attention, I think you can see why that didn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>In 1928, since he didn&#8217;t have a computer, he made a simple model that treated emission of infrared radiation as follows.  </p>
<p>He treated the atmosphere as made of layers of varying thickness, each layer containing 0.03 grams per centimeter<sup>2</sup> of water vapor.  The Earth&#8217;s surface radiates infrared almost as a black body.  Part of the power is absorbed by the first layer above the surface, while some makes it through.  The first layer then re-radiates at the same wavelengths at a rate determined by its temperature.  Half this goes downward, while half goes up.  Of the part going upward, some is absorbed by the next layer&#8230; and so on, up to the top layer.  He took this top layer to end at the stratosphere, since the atmosphere is much drier in the stratosphere.  </p>
<p>He did this all in a way that depends on the wavelength, but using a simplified model of how each of these layers absorbs infrared light.  He assumed it was:</p>
<p>&bull; completely opaque from 5.5 to 7 micrometers (due to water vapor),</p>
<p>&bull; partly transparent from 7 to 8.5 micrometers (interpolating between opaque and transparent),</p>
<p>&bull; completely transparent from 8.5 to 11 micrometers,</p>
<p>&bull; partly transparent from 11 to 14 micrometers (interpolating between transparent and opaque),</p>
<p>&bull; completely opaque above 14 micrometers (due to carbon dioxide and water vapor).</p>
<p>He got this result, at the latitude 50&deg; on a clear day:</p>
<div align="center"><a href=""><br />
<img src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ecological/simpson_outgoing_radiation.jpg" /></a>
</div>
<p>The upper smooth curve is the Planck distribution for a temperature of 280 K, corresponding to the ground.  The lower smooth curve is the Planck distribution at 218 K, corresponding to the stratosphere.  The shaded region is his calculation of the monochromatic flux emitted into space by the Earth.  As you can see, it matches the Planck distribution for the stratosphere where the lower atmosphere is completely opaque in his model&#8212;between 5.5 and 7 micrometers, and over 14 micrometers.  It matches the Planck distribution for the stratosphere where the lower atmosphere is completely transparent.  Elsewhere, it interpolates between the two.  </p>
<p>The area of this shaded region&#8212;calculated with a planimeter, perhaps?&#8212;is the total flux emitted into space.</p>
<p>This is just part of the story: he also took clouds into account, and he did different calculations at different latitudes.   He got a reasonably good balance between the incoming and outgoing power.  In short, he showed that an Earth with its observed temperatures is roughly compatible with his model of how the Earth absorbs and emits radiation.   Note that this is just another way to tackle the problem of <i>predicting</i> the temperature <i>given</i> a model. </p>
<p>Also note that Simpson didn&#8217;t quite use the Schwarzschild equation.  But I guess that in some sense he discretized it&#8212;right?</p>
<h3> And so on </h3>
<p>This was just the beginning of a series of more and more sophisticated models.   I&#8217;m too tired to go on right now.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll note one big thing we&#8217;ve omitted: any sort of calculation of how the pressure, temperature and humidity of the air varies with altitude!  To the extent we talked about those at all, we treated them as <i>inputs</i>.  But for a full-fledged one-dimensional model of the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere, we&#8217;d want to <i>derive</i> them from some principles.  There are, after all, some important puzzles:</p>
<p><b>Puzzle 4.</b>  If hot air rises, why does the atmosphere generally get colder as you go upward, at least until you reach the stratosphere?</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://www.srh.noaa.gov/jetstream/atmos/atmprofile.htm"><img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ecological/atmosphere_temperature_profile.jpg" /></a></div>
<p><b>Puzzle 5.</b>  Why is there a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropopause">tropopause</a>? In other words, why is there a fairly sudden transition 10 kilometers up between the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troposphere">troposphere</a>, where the air is moist, cooler the higher you go, and turbulent, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere">stratosphere</a>, where the air is drier, warmer the higher you go, and not turbulent?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a limit to how much we can understand these puzzles using a 1-dimensional model, but we should at least <i>try</i> to make a model of a thin column of air with pressure, temperature and humidity varying as a function of altitude, with sunlight streaming downward and infrared radiation generally going up.  If we can&#8217;t do that, we&#8217;ll never understand more complicated things, like the actual atmosphere.</p>
