<h4> The Case of the Missing 33 Kelvin, Continued </h4>
<p>Last time, when we talked about <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/06/19/putting-the-earth-in-a-box/">putting the Earth in a box</a>, we saw that a simple back-of-the-envelope calculation of the energy balance and resulting black body temperature of the earth comes surprisingly close to the right answer.  </p>
<p>But there was a gap: the black body temperature calculated with a zero-dimensional <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Energy+balance+model">energy balance model</a> is about 33 kelvin lower than the estimated average surface temperature on Earth.  </p>
<p>In other words, this simplified model predicts an Earth that&#8217;s 33 &deg;C colder than it really is!</p>
<p>In such a situation, as theoretical physicists, we start by taking a bow, patting ourselves on the back, and congratulating ourselves on a successful first approximation.    </p>
<p>Then we look for the next most important effect that we need to include in our model.</p>
<p>This effect needs to: </p>
<p>1) have a steady and continuous influence over thousands of years,</p>
<p>2) have a global impact,</p>
<p>3) be rather strong, because heating the planet Earth by 33 kelvin on the average needs a lot of power.</p>
<p>The simplest explanation would of course be that there is something fundamentally wrong with our back-of-the-envelope calculation.  <img src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/emoticons/tongue2.gif" /></p>
<p>One possibility, as <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/06/19/putting-the-earth-in-a-box/#comment-6435">Itai Bar-Natan mentioned</a> last time, is geothermal energy.  It certainly matches point 1, maybe matches point 2, but it is hard to guess if it matches point 3.  As <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/06/19/putting-the-earth-in-a-box/#comment-6427">John pointed out</a>, we can check the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_energy_budget">Earth&#8217;s energy budget</a> on Wikipedia.  This suggests that the geothermal heating is very small. Should we trust Wikipedia?  I don&#8217;t know.  We should check it out! </p>
<p>But I will not do that today. Instead I would like to talk about the most prominent explanation:</p>
<p>Most of you will of course have heard about the effect that climate scientists talk about, which is often&mdash;but confusingly&mdash;called the &#8216;greenhouse effect&#8217;, or &#8216;back radiation&#8217;.   However, the term that is most accurate is <b>downward longwave radiation</b> (DLR), so I would like to use <i>that</i> instead. </p>
<p>In order to assess if this is a viable explanation of the missing 33 kelvin, we will first have to understand the effect better. So this is what I will talk about today.</p>
<p>In order to get a better understanding, we will have to peek into our simple model&#8217;s box and figure out what is going on in there in more detail.</p>
<h4> Peeking into the Box: Surface and Atmosphere </h4>
<p>To get a better approximation, instead of treating the whole earth as a black body, we will have to split up the system into the Earth itself, and its atmosphere. For the surface of the Earth it is still a good approximation to say that it is a black body.</p>
<p>The atmosphere is more complicated. In a next approximation step, I would like to pretend that the atmosphere is a body of its own, hovering above the surface of the earth, as a separate system. So we will ignore that there are several different layers in the atmosphere doing different things, including interactions with the surface.  Well, we are not going to ignore the interaction with the surface completely, as you will see.</p>
<p>Since one can quickly get lost in details when discussing the atmosphere, I&#8217;m going to cheat and look up the overall average effects in an introductory meteorology textbook: </p>
<p>&bull; C. Donald Ahrens: <i>Meteorology Today</i>, 9th edition, Brooks/Cole, Florence, Kentucky, 2009.</p>
<p>Here is what atmosphere and Earth&#8217;s surface do to the incoming radiation from the Sun (from page 48):</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/files/incoming_sun_radiation_balance.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>Of 100 units of inbound solar energy flux, 30 are reflected or scattered back to space without a contribution to the energy balance of the Earth.  This corresponds to an overall average albedo of 0.3 for the Earth.</p>
<p>The next graphic shows the most important processes of heat and mass transport caused by the remaining 70 units of energy flux, with their overall average effect (from page 49):</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/files/energy_balance_atmosphere.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>Maybe you have some questions about this graphic; I certainly do.</p>
<h4>Conduction and Convection?</h4>
<p>Introductory classes for partial differential equations sometimes start with the one dimensional heat equation.  This equation describes the temperature distribution of a rod of metal that is heated on one end and kept cool on the other. The kind of heat transfer occurring here is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conduction_%28heat%29"><b>conduction</b></a>. The atoms or molecules stay where they are and transfer energy by interacting with their neighbors. </p>
<p>However, heat transfer by conduction is <i>negligible for gases</i> like the atmosphere.  Why is it there in the graphic? The answer may be that conduction is still important for boundary layers. Or maybe the author wanted to include it to avoid the question &#8220;why is conduction <i>not</i> in the graphic?&#8221; I don&#8217;t know. But I&#8217;ll trust that the number associated with the &#8220;convection and conduction&#8221; part is correct, for now.</p>
<h4>What is Latent Heat?</h4>
<p>There is a label &#8220;latent heat&#8221; on the left part of the atmosphere: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_heat"><b>latent heat</b></a> is energy <i>input</i> that does not result in a temperature <i>increase</i>, or energy <i>output</i> that does not result in a temperature <i>decrease</i>. This can happen, when there is a phase change of a component of the system.  For example, when liquid water at 0°C freezes, it turns into ice at 0°C while losing energy to its environment. But the temperature of the whole system stays at 0°C.</p>
<p>The human body uses this effect, too, when it cools itself by sweating. This cooling effect works as long as the fluid water turns into water vapor and withdraws energy from the skin in the process. </p>
<div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/files/freezing_forest.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>The picture above shows a forest with water vapor (invisible), fluid (dispersed in the air) and snow. As the Sun sets, parts of the water vapor will eventually condense, and fluid water will turn into ice, releasing energy to the environment. During the phase changes there will be energy loss without a temperature decrease of the water. </p>
<h4>Downward Longwave Radiation</h4>
<blockquote><p> <i>When there is a lot of light there are also dark shadows.</i> &mdash; main character in Johann Wolfgang von Goethe&#8217;s <i>Götz von Berlichingen</i> </p></blockquote>
<p>Last time we pretended that the Earth as a whole behaves like a black body.</p>
<p>Now that we split up the Earth into surface and atmosphere, you may notice that: </p>
<p>a) a lot of sunlight passes through the atmosphere and reaches the surface, and</p>
<p>b) there is a lot of energy flowing downwards from the atmosphere to the surface in form of infrared radiation. This is called <b>downward longwave radiation</b>. </p>
<p>Observation a) shows that the atmosphere does not act like a black body at all. Instead, it has a nonzero <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmittance"><b>transmittance</b></a>, which means that not <i>all</i> incoming radiation is absorbed. </p>
<p>Observation b) shows that assuming that the black body temperature of the Earth is equal to the average surface temperature <i>could</i> go wrong, because&mdash;from the viewpoint of the surface&mdash;there is an additional inbound energy flux from the atmosphere.</p>
<p>The reason for both observations is that the atmosphere consists of various gases, like O<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O (water vapor) and CO<sub>2</sub>.  Any gas molecule can absorb and emit radiation only at certain frequencies, which are called its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_spectrum"><b>emission spectrum</b></a>.  This fact led to the development of quantum mechanics, which can be used to calculate the emission spectrum of any molecule.</p>
<h4>Molecules and Degrees of Freedom</h4>
<p>When a photon hits a molecule, the molecule can absorb the photon and gain energy in three main ways:</p>
<p>&bull; One of its electron can climb to a higher energy level.</p>
<p>&bull; The molecule can vibrate more strongly.</p>
<p>&bull; The molecule can rotate more rapidly.</p>
<p>To get a first impression of the energy levels involved in these three processes, let&#8217;s have a look at this graphic:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/files/molecular_degrees_of_freedom.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>This is taken from the book</p>
<p>* Sune Svanberg, _Atomic and Molecular Spectroscopy: Basic Aspects and Practical Applications_, 4th edition, Advanced Texts in Physics, Springer, Berlin, 2004.</p>
<p>The y-axis shows the energy difference in &#8216;eV&#8217;, or &#8216;electron volts&#8217;.  An <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_volt"><b>electron volt</b></a> is the amount of energy an electron gains or loses as its potential changes by one volt.</p>
<p>Accoding to quantum mechanics, a molecule can emit and absorb only photons whose energy matches the difference of one of the discrete energy levels in the graphic, for any one of the three processes. </p>
<p>It is possible to use the characteristic absorption and emission properties of molecules of different chemical species to analyze the chemical composition of an unknown probe of gases (and other materials, too). These methods are usually called names involving the word <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy">&#8216;spectroscopy&#8217;</a>.  For example, infrared spectroscopy involves methods that examine what happens to infrared radiation when you send it to your probe.</p>
<p>By the way, Wikipedia has a funny animated picture of the different vibrational modes of a molecule on the page about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_spectroscopy">infrared spectroscopy</a>.  </p>
<p>But why does so much of radiation from the Sun pass through the atmosphere, while a lot of infrared radiation emitted by the Earth instead bounces back to the surface?  The answer to this puzzle involves a specific property of certain components of the atmosphere. </p>
<h4>Can You See an Electron Hopping?</h4>
<p>Here is a nice overview of the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation: </p>
<div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/files/electromagnetic_radiation.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p>The energy <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="E" class="latex" /> and the wavelength <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;lambda" class="latex" /> of a photon have a very simple relationship:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+E+%3D+%5Cfrac%7Bc+%5C%3B+h%7D%7B%5Clambda%7D%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ E = &#92;frac{c &#92;; h}{&#92;lambda}} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="h" class="latex" /> is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant">Planck&#8217;s constant</a> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c" class="latex" /> is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light">speed of light</a>.  In short, photons with longer wavelengths have less energy.</p>
<p>Planck&#8217;s constant is </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h+%5Capprox+6+%5Ctimes+10%5E%7B-15%7D+%5C%3B+eV+%5Ctimes+s+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="h &#92;approx 6 &#92;times 10^{-15} &#92;; eV &#92;times s " class="latex" /></p>
<p>while the speed of light is</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+%5Capprox+3+%5Ctimes+10%5E%7B8%7D+%5C%3B+m%2Fs&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c &#92;approx 3 &#92;times 10^{8} &#92;; m/s" class="latex" /></p>
<p>Plugging these into the formula we get that a photon with an energy of one electron volt has a wavelength of about 1.2 micrometers, which is just outside the visible range, a bit towards the infrared direction. The visible range corresponds to 1.6 to 3.4 electron volts. If you want, you can scroll up to the graphic with the energy levels and calculate which processese will result in which kind of radiation.</p>
<p>Electrons that take a step down the orbital ladder in an atom emit a photon. Depending on the atom and the kind of transition, some of those photons will be in the visible range, and some will be in the ultraviolet.</p>
<h4>There is no Infrared from the Sun (?)</h4>
<p>From the Planck distribution, we can determine that the Sun and Earth, which are approximately black bodies, emit radiation mostly at very different wavelengths:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/files/earth_and_sun_emission.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p>This graphic is sometimes called &#8216;twin peak graph&#8217;.</p>
<p>Oversimplifying, we could say: The Earth emits infrared radiation; the Sun emits almost no infrared. So, if you find infrared radiation on earth, you can be sure that it did not come from the Sun.</p>
<p>The problem with this statement is that, strictly speaking, the Sun <i>does</i> emit radiation at wavelengths that are in the infrared range. This is the reason why people have come up with the term <b>near-infra-red radiation</b>, which we define to be the range of 0.85 and 5.0 micrometer wavelength. Radiation with longer wavelengths is called <b>far infrared</b>. With these definitions we can say that the Sun radiates in the near-infra-red range, and earth does not.  </p>
<p>Only certain components of the atmosphere emit and absorb radiation in the infrared part. These are called&mdash;somewhat misleadingly&mdash;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas">greenhouse gases</a>. I would like to call them &#8216;infrared-active gases&#8217; instead, but unfortunately the &#8216;greenhouse gas&#8217; misnomer is very popular. Two prominent ones are H<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub>: </p>
<div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/files/CO2_and_HO2_spectra.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_window"><b>atmospheric window</b></a> at 8 to 12μm is quite transparent, which means that this radiation passes from the surface through the atmosphere into space without much ado. Therefore, this window is used by satellites to estimate the surface temperature. </p>
<p>Since most radiation coming from the Earth is infrared, and only some constituents of the atmosphere react to it&mdash;excluding the major ones&mdash;a small amount of, say, CO<sub>2</sub> <i>could</i> have a lot of influence on the energy balance. Like being the only one in a group of hundreds with a boom box. But we should check that more thoroughly.</p>
<h4>Can a Cold Body Warm a Warmer Body?</h4>
<p>Downward longwave radiation warms the surface, but the atmosphere is colder than the surface, so how can radiation from the colder atmosphere result in a higher surface temperature? Doesn&#8217;t that violate the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics">second law of thermodynamics</a>?</p>
<p>The answer is: no, it does not. It turns out that others have already taken pains to explain this on the blogosphere, so I&#8217;d like to point you there instead of trying to do a better job here:</p>
<p>&bull; Roy Spencer, <a href="http://www.drroyspencer.com/2010/07/yes-virginia-cooler-objects-can-make-warmer-objects-even-warmer-still">Yes, Virginia, cooler objects can make warmer objects even warmer still</a>, 23 July 2010.</p>
<p>&bull; The Science of Doom, <a href="http://scienceofdoom.com/2010/07/17/the-amazing-case-of-back-radiation">The amazing case of “back-radiation”</a>, 27 July 2010.</p>
<h4>It&#8217;s the Numbers, Stupid!</h4>
<blockquote><p> <i>Shut up and calculate!</i> &mdash; Leitmotiv of several prominent physicists after becoming exhausted by philosophical discussions about the interpretation of quantum mechanics. </p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe we have succeeded by now to convince the imaginary advisory board of the zero dimensional energy balance model project that there really is an effect like &#8216;downward longwave radiation&#8217;. It certainly should be there if quantum mechanics is right. But I have not explained yet how <i>big</i> it is. According to the book <i>Meteorology Today</i>, it is big. But maybe the people who contributed to the graphic got fooled somehow; and there really is a different explanation for the case of the missing 33 kelvin. </p>
<p>What do <i>you</i> think? </p>
<p>When we dip our toes into a new topic, it is important to keep simple yet fundamental questions like this in mind, and keep asking them.</p>
<p>In this case we are lucky: it is possible to measure the amount of downward longwave radiation. There are a lot of field studies, and the results have been incorporated in global climate models. But we will have to defer this story to another day.</p>

<h4> Fried on Mercury </h4>
<p>Is it possible to fly to Mercury in a spaceship without being fried? </p>
<p>If you think it should be possible to do a simple back-on-the-envelope calculation that answers this question, you&#8217;re right! And NASA has already done it:</p>
<div align="center">

</div>
<p>This is interesting for astronauts&mdash;but it&#8217;s interesting for a first estimation of the climate of planets, too. In particular, for the Earth. In this post, I would like to talk about how this estimate is done and what it means for climate science.</p>
<h4> The Simplest Possible Model </h4>
<blockquote><p>
<i>How do physicists model a farm? They say: &#8220;First, let&#8217;s assume that all cows are spherical with homogeneous milk distribution&#8221;.</i> &#8211; Anonymous
</p></blockquote>
<p>Theoretical physicists have a knack for creating the simplest possible model for very complicated systems and still have some measure of success with it. This is no different when the system is the whole climate of the earth:</p>
<p>The back-on-the-envelope calculation mentioned above has a name; people call it a &#8216;zero-dimensional <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Energy+balance+model">energy balance model</a>&#8216;. </p>
<p>Surprisingly, the story of energy balance models starts with a prominent figure in physics and one of the most important discoveries of 20th century physics: Max Planck and &#8216;black body radiation&#8217;.</p>
<h4> Black Body Radiation </h4>
<p>Matter emits electromagnetic radiation&mdash;at least the matter that we know best. Physicists have also postulated the existence of matter out in space that does not radiate at all, called &#8216;dark matter&#8217;, but that doesn&#8217;t need to concern us here. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/emoticons/wink.gif" /></p>
<p>Around 1900, the German physicist Max Planck set out to solve an important problem of thermodynamics: to calculate the amount of radiation emitted by matter based on first principles.</p>
<p>To solve the problem, Planck made a couple of simplifying assumptions about the kind of matter he would think of. These assumptions characterize what is known in physics as a perfect &#8216;black body&#8217;.</p>
<p>A <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_body">black body</a></b> is an object that perfectly absorbs and therefore also perfectly emits all electromagnetic radiation at all frequencies.  Real bodies don&#8217;t have this property; instead, they absorb radiation at certain frequencies better than others, and some not at all. But there are materials that do come rather close to a black body. Usually one adds another assumption to the characterization of an ideal black body: namely, that the <i>radiation is independent of the direction</i>.</p>
<p>When the black body has a certain temperature <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T" class="latex" />, it will emit electromagnetic radiation, so it will send out a certain amount of energy per second for every square meter of surface area.  We will call this the <b>energy flux</b> and denote this as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" />.  The SI unit for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" /> is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W%2Fm%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="W/m^2" class="latex" />: that is, watts per square meter.   Here the <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt">watt</a></b> is a unit of energy per time.</p>
<p>This electromagnetic radiation comes in different wavelengths.  So, can ask how much energy flux our black body emits per change in wavelength.  This depends on the wavelength.  We will call this the <b>monochromatic energy flux</b> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%7B%5Clambda%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_{&#92;lambda}" class="latex" />.  The SI unit for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%7B%5Clambda%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_{&#92;lambda}" class="latex" /> is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W%2F%28m%5E2+%5C%3B+%5Cmu+m%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="W/(m^2 &#92;; &#92;mu m)" class="latex" />, where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu+m&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mu m" class="latex" /> stands for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micrometre"><b>micrometer</b></a>: a millionth of a meter, which is a unit of wavelength.  We call <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%5Clambda&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_&#92;lambda" class="latex" /> the &#8216;monochromatic&#8217; energy flux because it gives a number for any fixed wavelength <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;lambda" class="latex" />. When we integrate the monochromatic energy flux over all wavelengths, we get the energy flux <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>For the ideal black body, it turned out to be possible for Max Planck to calculate the monochromatic energy flux <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%7B%5Clambda%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_{&#92;lambda}" class="latex" />, but to his surprise, Planck had to introduce in addition the assumption that energy comes in quanta.  This turned out to be the birth of quantum mechanics!</p>
<h4>Understanding Thermodynamics: The Planck Distribution </h4>
<p>His result is called the <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_law">Planck distribution</a></b>:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+f_%7B%5Clambda%7D%28T%29+%3D+%5Cfrac%7Bc_1%7D%7B%5Clambda%5E5+%28e%5E%7Bc_2%2F%5Clambda+T%7D+-+1%29%7D+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ f_{&#92;lambda}(T) = &#92;frac{c_1}{&#92;lambda^5 (e^{c_2/&#92;lambda T} - 1)} }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>Here I have written <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c_1" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c_2" class="latex" /> for two constants. These can be calculated in terms of fundamental constants of physics. But for us this does not matter now.  What matters is what the function looks like as a function of the wavelength <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;lambda" class="latex" /> for the temperature of the Sun and the Earth. </p>
<p>As usual, Wikipedia has a great page about this:</p>
<p>&bull;  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_body_radiation">Black body radiation</a>, Wikipedia.</p>
<p>The following picture shows the energy flux as a function of the wavelength, for different temperatures:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/files/blackbody_radiation.jpg" alt="" />
</div>
<p>The Earth radiates roughly like the 300 kelvin curve and the Sun like the 5800 kelvin curve. You may notice that the maximum of the Sun&#8217;s radiation is at the wavelengths that are visible to human eyes.</p>
<p>Real surfaces are a little bit different than the ideal black body:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/files/blackbody_radiation_real_surface.jpg" alt="" />
</div>
<p>As we can see, the real surface emits less radiation than the ideal black body. This is not a coincidence: the black body is by definition the body that generates the highest energy flux at a fixed temperature. </p>
<p>A simple way to take this into account is to talk about a <b>grey body</b>, which is a body that has the same monochromatic energy flux as the black body, but reduced by a constant factor, the <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emissivity">emissivity</a></b>.</p>
<p>It is possible to integrate the black body radiation over all wavelengths, to get the relation between temperature <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T" class="latex" /> and energy flux <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" />.  The answer is surprisingly simple:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f+%3D+%5Csigma+%5C%3B+T%5E4+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f = &#92;sigma &#92;; T^4 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>This is called the <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan-Boltzmann_law">Stefan-Boltzmann law</a></b>, and the constant <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csigma&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;sigma" class="latex" /> is called the <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan-Boltzmann_constant">Stefan-Boltzmann constant</a></b>. Using this formula, we can assign to every energy flux <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" /> a black body temperature <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T" class="latex" />, which is the temperature that an ideal black body would need to have to emit <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" />. </p>
<h4> Energy Balance of Planets </h4>
<p>A planet like Earth gets energy from the Sun and loses energy by radiating to space. Since the Earth sits in empty space, these two processes are the only relevant ones that describe the energy flow. </p>
<div align="center">
<img width="350" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/files/apollo8.jpg" alt="" />
</div>
<p>The radiation emitted by the Sun results at the distance of earth to an energy flux of about 1370 watts per square meter. We need to account for the fact, however, that the Earth receives energy from the Sun on one half of the globe only, on the area of a circle with the radius of the Earth, but radiates from the whole surface of the whole sphere. This means that the average outbound energy flux is actually <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B4%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;frac{1}{4}" class="latex" /> of the inbound energy flux.   (The question if there is some deeper reason for this simple relation was posed as a <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/10/11/geometry-puzzle/">geometry puzzle</a> here on Azimuth.)</p>
<p>So, now we are in a position to check if NASA got it right!</p>
<p>The Stefan-Boltzmann constant has a value of </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csigma+%3D+5.670+400+%5Ctimes+10%5E%7B-8%7D+%5Cfrac%7BW%7D%7Bm%5E2+K%5E4%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;sigma = 5.670 400 &#92;times 10^{-8} &#92;frac{W}{m^2 K^4} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>which results in a black body temperature of about 279 kelvin, which is about 6 &deg;C:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B1370%7D%7B4%7D+W+m%5E%7B-2%7D+%5C%3B%5Capprox+%5C%3B+5.67+%5C%2C%5Ctimes+%5C%2C10%5E%7B-8%7D+%5Cfrac%7BW%7D%7Bm%5E2+K%5E4%7D+%5C%2C+%5Ctimes+%5C%2C+%28279+K%29%5E4+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;frac{1370}{4} W m^{-2} &#92;;&#92;approx &#92;; 5.67 &#92;,&#92;times &#92;,10^{-8} &#92;frac{W}{m^2 K^4} &#92;, &#92;times &#92;, (279 K)^4 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>That is not bad for a first approximation! The next step is to take into account the &#8216;albedo&#8217; of the Earth. The <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo">albedo</a></b> is the fraction of radiation that is instantly reflected without being absorbed. The albedo of a surface does depend on the material of the surface, and in particular on the wavelength of the radiation, of course. But in a first approximation for the average albedo of earth we can take:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7Balbedo%7D_%7B%5Cmathrm%7BEarth%7D%7D+%3D+0.3+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{albedo}_{&#92;mathrm{Earth}} = 0.3 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>This means that 30% of the radiation is instantly reflected and only 70% contributes to heating earth. When we take this into account by multiplying the left side of the previous equation by 0.7, we get a black body temperature of 255 kelvin, which is -18 &deg;C. </p>
<p>Note that the emissivity factor for grey bodies <i>does not change the equation</i>, because it works both ways: the absorption of the incoming radiation is reduced by the same factor as the emitted radiation.</p>
<p>The average temperature of earth is actually estimated to be some 33 kelvin higher, that is about +15 &deg;C. This should not be a surprise: after all, 70% of the planet is covered by liquid water! This is an indication that the average temperature is most probably not below the freezing point of water.  </p>
<p>The albedo depends a lot on the material: for example, it is almost 1 for fresh snow.  This is one reason people wear sunglasses for winter sports, even though the winter sun is considerably dimmer than the summer sun in high latitudes.</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="350" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/files/snowboarder.gif" alt="" /></div>
<p>Since a higher albedo results in a lower temperature for the Earth, you may wonder what happens when there is more snow and ice?  This results in a lower absorption, which leads to less heat, which results in even more snow and ice. This is an example of <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_feedback">positive feedback</a></b>, which is a reaction that strengthens the process that caused the reaction. There is a theory that something like this happened to the Earth about 600 million years ago. The scenario is aptly called <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Snowball+Earth">Snowball Earth</a>.  This theory is based on geological evidence that at that time there was a glaciation that reached the equator! And it works the other way around, too.</p>
<p>Since a higher temperature leads to a higher radiation and therefore to cooling, and a lower temperature leads to a lower radiation, according to the Planck distribution, there is always a <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_feedback">negative feedback</a></b> present in the climate system of the earth. This is dubbed the <b>Planck feedback</b> and has already been mentioned in <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/09/09/this-weeks-finds-week-302/">week 302</a> of &#8220;This Weeks Finds&#8221; here on Azimuth.</p>
<p>Now, the only variable that a zero dimensional energy balance model calculates is the average temperature of earth. But does it even make sense to talk about the &#8220;average&#8221; temperature of the whole planet?</p>
<h4> The Role of the Atmosphere and Rotation </h4>
<p>It is always possible to &#8220;put a planet into a box&#8221;, calculate the inbound energy flux, and compute from this a black body temperature <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T" class="latex" />&mdash;given that the inbound energy per second is equal to the outgoing energy per second, which is the condition of thermodynamic equilibrium for this system. We will always be able to calculate this temperature <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T" class="latex" />, but of course there may be very strange things going on inside the box, that make it nonsense to talk about an average temperature. As far as we know, one side of the planet may be burning and the other side may be freezing, for example.</p>
<p>For planets with slow rotation and no atmosphere, this actually happens! This applies to Mercury and the moon of the Earth, for example. In the case of Earth itself, most of the heat energy is stored in the oceans and it spins rather fast. This means that it is not completely implausible to talk about a &#8216;mean surface air temperature&#8217;. But it could be interesting to take into account the different energy input at different latitudes! Models that do that are called &#8216;one-dimensional&#8217; energy balance models. And we should of course take a closer look at the heat and mass transfer processes of the earth. But since this post is already rather long, I&#8217;ll skip that for now. </p>
<h4> The Case of the Missing 33 Kelvins </h4>
<p>The simple back-of-the-envelope calculation of the simplest possible climate model shows that there is a difference of roughly 33 kelvin between the black body temperature and the mean surface temperature on earth. </p>
<p>There is an explanation for this difference; I bet that you have already heard of it! But I&#8217;ll postpone that one for another post.</p>
<p>If you would like to learn more about climate models, you should check out this book:</p>
<p>&bull; Kendal McGuffie and Ann Henderson-Sellers, <i>A Climate Modelling Primer</i>, 3rd edition, Wiley, New York, 2005.</p>
<p>Whenever I wrote &#8220;NASA&#8221; I was actually referring to this paper:</p>
<p>&bull; Albert J. Juhasz, <a href="http://gltrs.grc.nasa.gov/reports/2001/TM-2001-210063.pdf">An analysis and procedure for determining space environmental sink temperatures with selected computational results</a>, NASA/TM—2001-210063, 2001.</p>
<p>The pictures of black body radiation are taken from this book:</p>
<p>&bull; Frank P. Incropera, David P. DeWitt, Theodore L. Bergman, Adrienne S. Lavine, <i>Fundamentals of Heat and Mass Transfer</i>, 6th edition, Wiley, New York, 2006.</p>
<h4> Being Cool on Mercury </h4>
<blockquote><p> <i>I want to paint it black.</i> &mdash; The Rolling Stones</p></blockquote>
<p>Last but not least: you can fly to Mercury without getting fried&#8230; but you have to paint your spaceship <i>white</i> in order to get a higher albedo.  </p>
<p>Really?   Well, it depends on the albedo of the whitest paint you can find: the one that reflects the Sun&#8217;s energy flux the most.  </p>
<p>So, here&#8217;s a puzzle: what&#8217;s the whitest paint you can find?   What&#8217;s its albedo?  And how hot would a spaceship with this paint get, if it were in Mercury&#8217;s orbit?</p>

					<p><i>guest post by <b><a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Tim+van+Beek">Tim van Beek</a></b></i></p>
<p>Among the prominent tools in climate science are complicated computer models.  For more on those, try this blog:</p>
<p>&bull; Steve Easterbrook, <a href="http://www.easterbrook.ca/steve/">Serendipity, or What has Software Engineering got to do with Climate Change?</a></p>
<p>After reading <a href="http://www.easterbrook.ca/steve/?p=2032">Easterbrook&#8217;s blog post about &#8220;climate model validation&#8221;</a>, and some discussions of this topic elsewhere, I noticed that there is some &#8220;computer terminology&#8221; floating around that disguises itself as plain English! This has led to some confusion, so I&#8217;d like to explain some of it here.</p>
<h3>Technobabble: The Quest for Cooperation</h3>
<p>Climate change may be the first problem in the history of humankind that has to be tackled on a global scale, by people all over the world working together. Of course, a prerequisite of working together is a mutual understanding and a mutual language. Unfortunately every single one of the many professions that scientists and engineers engage in have created their own dialect.  And most experts are proud of it! </p>
<p>When I read about the confusion that &#8220;validation&#8221; versus &#8220;verification&#8221; of climate models has caused, I was reminded of the phrase &#8220;technobabble&#8221;, which screenwriters for the TV series <i>Star Trek</i> used whenever they had to write a dialog involving the engineers on the Starship Enterprise. Something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p> &#8220;Captain, we have to send an inverse tachyon beam through the main deflector dish!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Ok, make it so!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Fortunately, neither Captain Picard nor the audience had to understand what was really going on.   </p>
<p>It&#8217;s a bit different in the real world, where not everyone may have the luxury of staying on the sidelines while the trustworthy crew members in the Enterprise&#8217;s engine room solve all the problems. We can start today by explaining some software engineering technobabble that came up in the context of climate models.  But why would software engineers bother in the first place? </p>
<h3> Short Review of Climate Models</h3>
<p>Climate models come in a hierarchy of complexity.  The simplest ones only try to simulate the energy balance of the planet earth.  These are called <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Energy+balance+model">energy balance models</a>.  They don&#8217;t take into account the spherical shape of the earth, for example.  </p>
<p>At the opposite extreme, the most complex ones try to simulate the material and heat flow of the atmosphere and the oceans on a topographical model of the spinning earth.  These are called <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/General+circulation+model">general circulation models</a>, or GCMs for short. GCMs have a lot of code, sometimes more than a million lines of code.</p>
<p>A line of code is basically one instruction for the computer to carry out, like:</p>
<blockquote><p> add 1/2 and 1/6 and store the result in a variable called e</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p> print e on the console</p></blockquote>
<p>In order to understand what a computer program does, in theory, one has to memorize every single line of code and understand it. And most programs use a lot of other programs, so in theory one would have to understand those, too. This is of course not possible for a single person!</p>
<p>We hope that taking into account a lot of effects, which results in a lot of lines of code, makes the models more accurate.  But it certainly means that they are complex enough to be interesting for software engineers.</p>
<p>In the case of software that is used to run an internet shop, a million lines of code isn&#8217;t much.  But it is already too big for one single person to handle. Basically, this is where all the problems start, that software engineering seeks to solve.</p>
<blockquote><p> <i>When more than one person works on a software project things often get complicated.</i> </p>
<p>(From the manual of CVS, the &#8220;Concurrent Versions System&#8221;.)
</p></blockquote>
<h3> Software Design Circle</h3>
<p>The job of software engineer is in some terms similar to the work of an architect.  The differences are mainly due to the abstract nature of software.   Everybody can see if a building is finished or if it isn&#8217;t, but that&#8217;s not possible with software. Nevertheless every software project does come to an end, and people have to decide whether or not the product, the software, is finished and does what it should.  But since software is so abstract, people have come up with special ideas about how the software &#8220;production process&#8221; should work and how to tell if the software is correct.  I would like to explain these a little bit further.</p>
<h4> Stakeholders and Shifts in Stakeholder Analysis</h4>
<p>There are many different people working in an office building with different interests: cleaning squads, janitors, plant security, and so on. When you design a new office building, you need to identify and take into account all the different interests of all these groups.  Most software projects are similar, and the process just mentioned is usually called <b>stakeholder analysis</b>.</p>
<p>Of course, if you take into account <i>only</i> the groups already mentioned, you&#8217;ll build an office building without any offices, because that would obviously be the simplest one to monitor and to keep working.   Such an office building wouldn&#8217;t make much sense, of course!  This is because we made a fatal mistake with our stakeholder analysis: we failed to take into account the most important stakeholders, the people who will actually <i>use</i> the offices. These are the <b>key stakeholders</b> of the office building project. </p>
<p>After all, the primary purpose of an office building is to provide offices. And in the end, if we have an office building without offices, we&#8217;ll notice that no one will pay us for our efforts. </p>
<h4> Gathering Requirements</h4>
<p>While it may be obvious what most people want from an office building, the situation is usually much more abstract, hence much more complicated, for software projects. </p>
<p>This is why software people carry out a <b>requirement analysis</b>, where they ask the stakeholders what they would like the software to do. A requirement for an office building might be, for example, &#8220;we need a railway station nearby, because most of the people who will work in the building don&#8217;t have cars.&#8221; A requirement for a software project might be, for example, &#8220;we need the system to send email notifications to our clients on a specific schedule&#8221;. </p>
<p>In an ideal world, the requirement analysis would result in a document &mdash;usually called something like a <b>system specification</b>&mdash;that contains both the requirements, and also descriptions of the test cases that are needed to test whether the finished system meets the requirements.  For example:</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;Employee A lives in an apartment 29 km away from the office building and does not have a car. She gets to work within 30 minutes by using public transportation.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<h4> Verification versus Validation</h4>
<p>When we have finished the office building (or the software system), we&#8217;ll have to do some <b>acceptance testing</b>, in order to convince our customer that she should pay us (or simply to use the system, if it is for free). When you buy a car, your &#8220;acceptance test&#8221; is driving away with it&mdash;if that does not work, you know that there is something wrong with your car! But for complicated software&mdash;or office buildings&mdash;we need to agree on what we do to test if the system is finished. That&#8217;s what we need the test cases for.</p>
<p>If we are lucky, the relevant test cases will already be described in the system specification, as noted above. But that is not the whole story. </p>
<p>Every scientific community that has its own identity invents its own new language, often borrowing words from everyday language and defining new, surprising, special meanings for them. Software engineers are no different. There are, for example, two very different aspects to testing  a system:</p>
<p>&bull; Did we do everything according to the system specification?</p>
<p>and:</p>
<p>&bull; Now that the system is there, and our key stakeholders can see it for themselves, did we get the system specification right: is our product useful to them?</p>
<p>The first is called  <b>verification</b>, the second <b>validation</b>. As you can see, software engineers took two almost synonymous words from everyday language and gave them quite different meanings!</p>
<p>For example, if you wrote in the specification for an online book seller:</p>
<blockquote><p> &#8220;we calculate the book price by multiplying the ISBN number by pi&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>and the final software system does just that, then the system is <i>verified</i>.  But if the book seller would like to stay in business, I bet that he won&#8217;t say the system has been <i>validated</i>.</p>
<h3> Stakeholders of Climate Models</h3>
<p>So, for business applications, it&#8217;s not quite right to ask &#8220;is the software correct?&#8221;  The really important question is: &#8220;is the software as useful for the key stakeholders as it should be?&#8221;</p>
<h4> But in Mathematics Everything is Either True or False!</h4>
<p>One may wonder if this &#8220;true versus useful&#8221; stuff above makes any sense when we think about a piece of software that calculates, for example, a known mathematical function like a &#8220;modified Bessel function of the first kind&#8221;. After all, it is defined precisely in mathematics what these functions look like.  </p>
<p>If we are talking about creating a program that can evaluate these functions, there are a lot of <i>technical</i> choices that need to be specified.  Here is a random example (if you don&#8217;t understand it, don&#8217;t worry, that is not necessary to get the point):</p>
<p>&bull; Current computers know data types with a finite value range and finite precision only, so we need to agree on which such data type we want as a model of the real or complex numbers.  For example, we might want to use the &#8220;double precision floating-point format&#8221;, which is an international standard.</p>
<p>Another aspect is, for example, &#8220;how long may the function take to return a value?&#8221; This is an example of a non-functional requirement (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-functional_requirement">Wikipedia</a>). These requirements will play a role in the implementation too, of course.</p>
<p>However, apart from these technical choices, there is no ambiguity as to what the function should do, so there is no need to distinguish verification and validation. Thank god that mathematics is eternal! A Bessel function will always be the same, for all of eternity.  <img src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/emoticons/tongue.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is no longer true when a computer program computes something that we would like to compare to the real world. Like, for example, a weather forecast. In this case the computer model will, like all models, include some aspects of the real world. Or rather, some specific implementations of a mathematical model of a part of the real world.</p>
<p>Verification will still be the same, if we understand it to be the stage where we test to see if the single pieces of the program compute what they are supposed to. The parts of the program that do things that can be defined in a mathematically precise way. But validation will be a whole different step if understood in the sense of &#8220;is the model useful?&#8221;</p>
<h4> But Everybody Knows What Weather Is!</h4>
<p>But still, does this apply to climate models at all? I mean, everybody knows what &#8220;climate&#8221; is, and &#8220;climate models&#8221; should simulate just that, right? </p>
<p>As it turns out, it is not so easy, because climate models serve very different purposes:</p>
<p>&bull; Climate scientists want to test their understanding of basic climate processes, just as physicists calculate a lot of solutions to their favorite theories to gain a better understanding of what these theories can and do model.</p>
<p>&bull; Climate models are also used to analyse observational data, to supplement such data and/or to correct them. Climate models have had success in detecting misconfiguration and biases in observational instruments. </p>
<p>&bull; Finally, climate models are also used for global and/or local predictions of climate change.</p>
<p>The question &#8220;is my climate model right?&#8221; therefore translates to the question &#8220;is my climate model useful?&#8221;  This question has to refer to a specific use of the model, or rather: to the viewpoint of the key stakeholders.</p>
<h4> The Shift of Stakeholders </h4>
<p>One problem of the discussions of the past seems to be due to a shift of the key stakeholders.  For example: some climate models have been developed as a tool for climate scientists to play around with certain aspects of the climate. When the scientists published papers, including insights gained from these models, they usually did not publish anything about the implementation details. Mostly, they did not publish anything about the model at all. </p>
<p>This is nothing unusual. After all, a physicist or mathematician will routinely publish her results and conclusions&mdash;maybe with proofs. But she is not required to publish every single thought she had to think to produce her results. </p>
<p>But after the results of climate science became a topic in international politics, a change of the key stakeholders occurred: a lot of people outside the climate science community developed an interest in the models. This is a good thing. There is a legitimate need of researchers to limit participation in the review process, of course. But when the results of a scientific community become the basis of far-reaching political decisions, there is a legitimate public interest in the details of the ongoing research process, too. The problem in this case is that the requirements of the new key stakeholders, such as interested software engineers outside the climate research community, are quite different from the requirements of the former key stakeholders, climate scientists.</p>
<p>For example, if you write a program for your own eyes only, there is hardly any need to write a detailed documentation of it. If you write it for others to understand it, as rule of thumb, you&#8217;ll have to produce at least as much documentation as code.</p>
<h4> Back to the Start: Farms, Fields and Forests</h4>
<p>As an example of a rather prominent critic of climate models, let&#8217;s quote the physicist <a href="http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=985641c9-8594-43c2-802d-947d65555e8e">Freeman Dyson</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p> The models solve the equations of fluid dynamics and do a very good job of describing the fluid motions of the atmosphere and the oceans.</p>
<p>They do a very poor job of describing the clouds, the dust, the chemistry and the biology of fields, farms and forests. They are full of fudge factors so the models more or less agree with the observed data. But there is no reason to believe the same fudge factors would give the right behaviour in a world with different chemistry, for example in a world with increased CO<sub>2</sub>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Let&#8217;s assume that Dyson is talking here about GCMs, with all their parametrizations of unresolved processes (which he calls &#8220;fudge factors&#8221;). Then the first question that comes to my mind is &#8220;why would a climate model <i>need</i> to describe fields, farms and forests in more detail?&#8221; </p>
<p>I&#8217;m quite sure that the answer will depend on what aspects of the climate the model should represent, in what regions and over what timescale. </p>
<p>And that certainly depends on the answer to the question &#8220;what will we use our model for?&#8221; Dyson seems to assume that the answer to this question is obvious, but I don&#8217;t think that this is true. So, maybe we should start with  &#8220;stakeholder analysis&#8221; first.</p>

				<small>9 June, 2011</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>Let&#8217;s try answering this question on Quora: </p>
<p><b><a href="http://www.quora.com/How-will-global-warming-and-particularly-sea-level-rises-affect-New-York-City">How will global warming, and particularly sea level rises, affect New York City?</a></b></p>
<p>I doubt sea level rise will be the first way we&#8217;ll get badly hurt by global warming.  I think it&#8217;ll be crop losses caused by floods, droughts and heat waves, and property damage caused by storms.  But the question focuses on sea level rise, so perhaps we should think about that&#8230; along with any other ways that New York City is <i>particularly</i> susceptible to the effects of global warming.</p>
<p>Suppose you know a lot about New York, but you need an estimate of sea level rise to get started.  In the Azimuth Project page on <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Sea+level+rise">sea level rise</a>, you&#8217;ll see a lot of discussion of this subject.  Naturally, it&#8217;s complicated.  But say you just want some numbers.  Okay: very roughly, by the end of the century we can expect a sea level of <b>at least 0.6 meters</b>, not counting any melting from Greenland and Antarctica and <b>at most 2 meters</b>, including Greenland and Antarctica.   That&#8217;s roughly between 2 and 6 feet.  </p>
<p>On the other hand, there&#8217;s at least one report saying <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090315155112.htm">sea levels may rise in the Northeast US at twice the average global rate</a>.  What&#8217;s the latest word on that?</p>
<p>Now, here&#8217;s a website that claims to show what various amounts of sea level rise would do to different areas:</p>
<p>&bull; Firetree.net, <a href="http://flood.firetree.net/?ll=43.3251,-101.6015&amp;z=13&amp;m=1">Flood maps</a>, including <a href="http://geology.com/sea-level-rise/new-york.shtml">New York City</a>.</p>
<p>Details on how these maps were made are <a href="http://blog.firetree.net/2006/05/18/more-about-flood-maps/">here</a>.  One problem is that they focus too much on really big sea level rises: the smallest rise shown is 1 meter, then 2 meters&#8230; and it goes up to 60 meters! </p>
<p>Anyway, here&#8217;s part of New York City now:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/new_york_city_map.jpg"><img width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/new_york_city_map.jpg" alt="" /></a></div>
<p>Here it is after a 1-meter (3-foot) sea level rise:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/new_york_city_map_1_meter_sea_level_rise.jpg"><br />
<img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/new_york_city_map_1_meter_sea_level_rise.jpg" alt="" /></a></div>
<p>(Click to enlarge any of these.)   And here&#8217;s 2 meters, or 6 feet:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/new_york_city_map_2_meter_sea_level_rise.jpg"><br />
<img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/new_york_city_map_2_meter_sea_level_rise.jpg" alt="" /></a></div>
<p>It&#8217;s a bit hard to spot the effects in Manhattan.  They&#8217;re much more noticeable in the low-lying areas between Jersey City and Secaucus.   What are those: parks, industrial areas, or suburbs?  I&#8217;ve heard New Yorkers crack jokes about the &#8216;swamps of Jersey&#8217;&#8230;</p>
<p>But of course, a lot of the city is underground.  What will happen to subways and other infrastructure, like sewage systems?  And what about water supplies?  On coastlines, saltwater can infiltrate into surface waters and aquifers.  Where does freshwater meet saltwater near New York City?  How will the effect of floods and storms change?</p>
<p>And of course, there are other parts of New York City these little maps don&#8217;t show: for those, go <a href="http://geology.com/sea-level-rise/new-york.shtml">here</a>.  But watch out: at first you&#8217;ll see the effect of a <i>7-meter</i> sea level rise&#8230; you&#8217;ll need to change the settings to see the effects of a more realistic rise.</p>
<p>If you live in a place that will be flooded, let me know!</p>
<p>Luckily, we don&#8217;t have to figure everything out ourselves: the state of New York has a task force devoted to this.  And as task forces do, they&#8217;ve written a report:</p>
<p>&bull; New York Department of Environmental Conservation, <a href="http://www.dec.ny.gov/energy/45202.html">Sea Level Rise Task Force</a>, <a href="http://www.dec.ny.gov/energy/67778.html">Final Report</a>.</p>
<p>New York City also has an ambitious environmental plan:</p>
<p>&bull; New York City, <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/planyc2030/html/theplan/the-plan.shtml">PlaNYC 2030</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, let me quote part of this:</p>
<p>&bull; Jim O&#8217;Grady, <a href="http://www.wnyc.org/articles/wnyc-news/2011/feb/09/climate-change/">Sea level rise could turn New York into Venice, experts warn</a>, <i>WNYC News</i>, 9 February 2011.</p>
<p>Because it looks ahead 200 years, this article paints a more dire picture than my remarks above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.gothamgazette.com/blogs/wonkster/2010/08/11/new-sustainability-director-selected/" target="_blank">David Bragdon</a>, Director of the <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/ops/html/long_term/long_term.shtml" target="_blank">Mayor&#8217;s Office of Long-Term Planning &amp; Sustainability</a>, is charged with preparing for the dangers of climate change. He said the city is taking precautions like raising the pumps at a wastewater treatment plant in the Rockaways and building the Willets Point development in Queens on six feet of landfill. The goal is to manage the risk from 100-year storms&mdash;one of the most severe. The mayor’s report says by the end of this century, 100-year storms could start arriving every 15 to 35 years.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sipa.columbia.edu/academics/directory/khj1-fac.html" target="_blank">Klaus Jacob</a>, a Columbia  University research scientist who specializes in disaster risk management, said that estimate may be too conservative. “What is now the impact of a 100-year storm will be, by the end of this century, roughly a 10-year storm,”  he warned.</p>
<p>Back on the waterfront, oceanographer <a href="http://stormy.msrc.sunysb.edu/mjb/biography.html">Malcolm Bowman</a> offered what he said is a suitably outsized solution to this existential threat: <a href="http://dvice.com/archives/2007/11/maeslant-storm-surge-barrier-s.php" target="_blank">storm surge barriers</a>.</p>
<p>They would rise from the waters at Throgs Neck, where Long Island Sound and the East River meet, and at the opening to the lower harbor between the Rockaways and Sandy Hook, New Jersey. Like the barriers on the Thames River that protect London, they would stay open most of the time to let ships pass but close to protect the city during hurricanes and severe storms. </p>
<p>The structures at their highest points would be 30 feet above the harbor surface. Preliminary engineering studies put the cost at around $11 billion.</p>
<div align="center"><a><img src="https://i0.wp.com/parmenides.wnyc.org/media/photologue/photos/lower-bay.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="301" /></a></div>
<p>Jacob suggested a different but equally drastic approach. He said sea level rise may force New Yorkers to pull back from vulnerable neighborhoods. “We will have to densify the high-lying areas and use the low-lying areas as parks and buffer zones,” he said.</p>
<p>In this scenario, New York in 200 years looks like <a href="http://www.veniceonline.it/Maps/Map2_VeniceOnLine.jpg" target="_blank">Venice</a>. Concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have melted ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica and raised our local sea level by six to eight feet. Inundating storms at certain times of year swell the harbor until it spills into the streets. Dozens of skyscrapers in Lower Manhattan have been sealed at the base and entrances added to higher floors. The streets of the financial district have become canals.</p>
<p>“You may have to build bridges or get Venice gondolas or your little speed boats ferrying yourself up to those buildings,” Jacob said.</p>
<p>David Bragdon is not comfortable with such scenarios. He’d rather talk about the concrete steps he’s taking now, like updating the city’s flood evacuation plan to show more neighborhoods at risk. That would help the people living in them be better prepared to evacuate.</p>
<p>He said it&#8217;s too soon to contemplate the &#8220;extreme&#8221; step of moving &#8220;two, three, four hundred thousand people out of areas they’ve occupied for generations,&#8221; and disinvesting &#8220;literally billions of dollars of infrastructure in those areas.&#8221; On the other hand: &#8220;Another extreme would be to hide our heads in the sand and say, ‘Nothing’s going to happen.’”</p>
<p>Bragdon said he doesn&#8217;t think New Yorkers of the future will have to retreat very far from shore, if at all, but he’s not sure. And he would neither commit to storm surge barriers nor eliminate them as an option. He said what’s needed is more study—and that he’ll have further details in April, when the city updates <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/planyc2030/html/home/home.shtml" target="_blank">PlaNYC</a>.</p>
<p>Jacob warned that in preparing for disaster, no matter how far off, there&#8217;s a gulf between study and action. &#8220;There’s a good intent,&#8221; he said of New York&#8217;s climate change planning to date. &#8220;But, you know, mother nature doesn’t care about intent. Mother nature wants to see resiliency. And that is questionable, whether we have that.”

					<p>Some good news!</p>
<p>The International Mathematical Union or <a href="http://www.mathunion.org/">IMU</a> is mainly famous for running the International Congress of Mathematicians every four years.  But they do <a href="http://www.mathunion.org/publications/bulletins/archive/no-38-december-1994/what-is-imu0/part-i/">other things, too</a>.  The new vice-president of the IMU is <a href="http://www.dms.umontreal.ca/Professeurs/rousseac/">Christiane Rousseau</a>.   Rousseau was already spearheading the <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/03/20/mathematics-of-planet-earth/">Mathematics of Planet Earth 2013</a> project.  Now she&#8217;s trying to get the IMU involved in a ten-year research initiative on sustainability.</p>
<p>As you can see from this editorial, she treats climate change and sustainability with the seriousness they deserve.  Let&#8217;s hope more mathematicians join in!</p>
<p>I would like to get involved somehow, but I&#8217;m not exactly sure how.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Editorial</h4>
<p>I had the privilege of being elected Vice-president of the IMU at the last General Assembly, and it is now five months that I am following the activities of the IMU. The subjects discussed at the Executive Committee are quite diverse, from the establishment of the permanent office to the ranking and pricing of journals, to mathematics in developing countries and the future ICM, and the members of the<br />
Executive Committee tend to specialize on one or two dossiers. Although I am a pure mathematician myself, I am becoming more and more interested in the science of sustainability, so let me talk to you of this. </p>
<p>IMU is one of the international unions inside the International Council of Science (<a href="http://www.icsu.org/">ICSU</a>). At the Executive we regularly receive messages from ICSU asking for input from its members. While it is not new that scientists are involved in the study of climate change and sustainability issues, a new feeling of emergency has developed. <b>The warning signs are becoming more numerous that urgent action is needed if we want to save the planet from a disastrous future</b>, since we may not be far from a point of no return: climate change with more extreme weather events, rising of the sea level with the melting of glaciers, shortage of food and water in the near future because of the increase of the world population and the climate change, loss of biodiversity, new epidemics or invasive species, etc. This explains why ICSU is starting a new 10-year research initiative: EARTH SYSTEM RESEARCH FOR GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY, and a Steering Committee for this initiative is presently nominated. The goals of the Initiative are to:</p>
<p>1. Deliver at global and regional scales the knowledge that societies need to effectively respond to global change while meeting economic and social goals;</p>
<p>2. Coordinate and focus international scientific research to address the <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/grand-challenges/">Grand Challenges</a> and <a href="http://www.igfagcr.org/index.php/challenge">Belmont Challenge</a>;</p>
<p>3. Engage a new generation of researchers in the social, economic, natural, health, and engineering sciences in global sustainability research.</p>
<p>In the same spirit, ICSU is preparing a strong scientific presence at the next United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (<a href="http://www.uncsd2012.org/rio20/">Rio+20</a>) that will take place on June 4-6, 2012 in Rio de Janeiro. For this, ICSU is organizing a number of preparatory regional and global meetings. It is clear that mathematical sciences have an essential role in the interdisciplinary research that needs to take place in order to achieve significant impact. The other scientific disciplines concerned are numerous from physics, to biology, to economics, etc.</p>
<p>Let me quote <a href="http://www.chichilnisky.com/">Graciela Chichilnisky</a>, the author of the carbon market of the UN Kyoto Protocol: &#8220;It is the physicists that study the climate change, but it is the economists who advise the politicians that take the decisions.&#8221; Considering the importance of the contribution of mathematical sciences in sustainability issues, IMU has asked to participate actively in these preparatory meetings and be represented at Rio+20.  This should be an occasion to build partnerships with the other scientific unions inside ICSU. More and more mathematicians and research institutes around the world become interested in sustainable development as is acknowledged by the large participation in <a href="http://www.mpe2013.org">Mathematics of Planet Earth 2013</a> which was recently endorsed by IMU. But the world needs more than a one year initiative. The science of sustainability is full of challenging problems which are very interesting mathematically. Many of these problems require new mathematical techniques. We could hope that these initiatives will allow training a new generation of researchers in mathematical sciences who will be able to work in interdisciplinary teams to address these issues.</p>

				<h2><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/06/01/the-stockholm-memorandum/" rel="bookmark">The Stockholm Memorandum</a></h2>
				<small>1 June, 2011</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>In May this year, the <a href="http://globalsymposium2011.org/">3rd Nobel Laureate Symposium</a> produced a document called <a href="http://globalsymposium2011.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/The-Stockholm-Memorandum.pdf">The Stockholm Memorandum</a> signed by 17 Nobel laureates, presumably from among <a href="http://globalsymposium2011.org/participants">these participants</a>.   It&#8217;s a clear call to action, so I&#8217;ll reproduce it all here.</p>
<h3>I. Mind-shift for a Great Transformation</h3>
<p>The Earth system is complex. There are many aspects that we do not yet understand. Nevertheless, we are the first generation with the insight of the new global risks facing humanity.</p>
<p>We face the evidence that our progress as the dominant species has come at a very high price. Unsustainable patterns of production, consumption, and population growth are challenging the resilience of the planet to support human activity. At the same time, inequalities between and within societies remain high, leaving behind billions with unmet basic human needs and disproportionate vulnerability to global environmental change.</p>
<p>This situation concerns us deeply. As members of the 3rd Nobel Laureate Symposium we call upon all leaders of the 21st century to exercise a collective responsibility of planetary stewardship. This means laying the foundation for a sustainable and equitable global civilization in which the entire Earth community is secure and prosperous.</p>
<p>Science indicates that we are transgressing <a href="http://multivu.prnewswire.com/mnr/stockholmresilience/40125/">planetary boundaries</a> that have kept civilization safe for the past 10,000 years. Evidence is growing that human pressures are starting to overwhelm the Earth’s buffering capacity.</p>
<p>Humans are now the most significant driver of global change, propelling the planet into a new geological epoch, the <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropocene">Anthropocene</a></i>. We can no longer exclude the possibility that our collective actions will trigger <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Tipping+point">tipping points</a>, risking abrupt and irreversible consequences for human communities and ecological systems.</p>
<p>We cannot continue on our current path. The time for procrastination is over. We cannot afford the luxury of denial. We must respond rationally, equipped with scientific evidence.</p>
<p>Our predicament can only be redressed by reconnecting human development and global sustainability, moving away from the false dichotomy that places them in opposition.</p>
<p>In an interconnected and constrained world, in which we have a symbiotic relationship with the planet, environmental sustainability is a precondition for poverty eradication, economic development, and social justice.</p>
<p>Our call is for fundamental transformation and innovation in all spheres and at all scales in order to stop and reverse global environmental change and move toward fair and lasting prosperity for present and future generations.</p>
<h3>II. Priorities for Coherent Global Action </h3>
<p>We recommend a dual track approach:</p>
<p>a) emergency solutions now, that begin to stop and reverse negative environmental trends and redress inequalities in the inadequate institutional frameworks within which we operate, and</p>
<p>b) long term structural solutions that gradually change values, institutions and policy frameworks. We need to support our ability to innovate, adapt, and learn.</p>
<h4>1. Reaching a more equitable world</h4>
<p>Unequal distribution of the benefits of economic development are at the root of poverty. Despite efforts to address poverty, more than a third of the world’s population still live on less than $2 per day. This needs our immediate attention. Environment and development must go hand in hand. We need to:</p>
<p>• Achieve the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Development_Goals">Millennium Development Goals</a>, in the spirit of the <a href="http://www.un.org/millennium/declaration/ares552e.htm">Millennium Declaration</a>, recognising that global sustainability is a precondition of success.</p>
<p>• Adopt a global contract between industrialized and developing countries to scale up investment in approaches that integrate poverty reduction, climate stabilization, and ecosystem stewardship.</p>
<h4>2. Managing the climate &#8211; energy challenge</h4>
<p>We urge governments to agree on global emission reductions guided by science and embedded in ethics and justice. At the same time, the energy needs of the three billion people who lack access to reliable sources of energy need to be fulfilled. Global efforts need to:</p>
<p>• Keep global warming below 2&deg;C, implying a peak in global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions no later than 2015 and recognise that even a warming of 2&deg;C carries a very high risk of serious impacts and the need for major adaptation efforts.</p>
<p>• Put a sufficiently high price on carbon and deliver the G-20 commitment to phase out fossil fuel subsidies, using these funds to contribute to the several hundred billion US dollars per year needed to scale up investments in renewable energy.</p>
<h4>3. Creating an efficiency revolution</h4>
<p>We must transform the way we use energy and materials. In practice this means massive efforts to enhance energy efficiency and resource productivity, avoiding unintended secondary consequences. The “throw away concept” must give way to systematic efforts to develop circular material flows. We must:</p>
<p>• Introduce strict resource efficiency standards to enable a decoupling of economic growth from resource use.</p>
<p>• Develop new business models, based on radically improved energy and material efficiency.</p>
<h4>4. Ensuring affordable food for all</h4>
<p>Current food production systems are often unsustainable, inefficient and wasteful, and increasingly threatened by dwindling oil and phosphorus resources, financial speculation, and climate impacts. This is already causing widespread hunger and malnutrition today. We can no longer afford the massive loss of biodiversity and reduction in carbon sinks when ecosystems are converted into cropland. We need to:</p>
<p>• Foster a new agricultural revolution where more food is produced in a sustainable way on current agricultural land and within safe boundaries of water resources.</p>
<p>• Fund appropriate sustainable agricultural technology to deliver significant yield increases on small farms in developing countries.</p>
<h4>5. Moving beyond green growth</h4>
<p>There are compelling reasons to rethink the conventional model of economic development. Tinkering with the economic system that generated the global crises is not enough. Markets and entrepreneurship will be prime drivers of decision making and economic change, but must be complemented by policy frameworks that promote a new industrial metabolism and resource use. We should:</p>
<p>• Take account of natural capital, ecosystem services and social aspects of progress in all economic decisions and poverty reduction strategies. This requires the development of new welfare indicators that address the shortcomings of GDP as an indicator of growth.</p>
<p>• Reset economic incentives so that innovation is driven by wider societal interests and reaches the large proportion of the global population that is currently not benefitting from these innovations.</p>
<h4>6. Reducing human pressures</h4>
<p>Consumerism, inefficient resource use and inappropriate technologies are the primary drivers of humanity’s growing impact on the planet. However, population growth also needs attention. We must:</p>
<p>• Raise public awareness about the impacts of unsustainable consumption and shift away from the prevailing culture of consumerism to sustainability.</p>
<p>• Greatly increase access to reproductive health services, education and credit, aiming at empowering women all over the world. Such measures are important in their own right but will also reduce birth rates.</p>
<h4>7. Strengthening earth system governance</h4>
<p>The multilateral system must be reformed to cope with the defining challenges of our time, namely transforming humanity&#8217;s relationship with the planet and rebuilding trust between people and nations. Global governance must be strengthened to respect planetary boundaries and to support regional, national and local approaches. We should:</p>
<p>• Develop and strengthen institutions that can integrate the climate, biodiversity and development agendas.</p>
<p>• Explore new institutions that help to address the legitimate interests of future generations.</p>
<h4>8. Enacting a new contract between science and society</h4>
<p>Filling gaps in our knowledge and deepening our understanding is necessary to find solutions to the challenges of the Anthropocene, and calls for major investments in science. A dialogue with decision-makers and the general public is also an important part of a new contract between science and society. We need to:</p>
<p>• Launch a major initiative on the earth system research for global sustainability, at a scale similar to those devoted to areas such as space, defence and health, to tap all sources of ingenuity across disciplines and across the globe.</p>
<p>• Scale up our education efforts to increase scientific literacy especially among the young.</p>
<p>We are the first generation facing the evidence of global change. It therefore falls upon us to change our relationship with the planet, in order to tip the scales towards a sustainable world for future generations.</p>

				<small>27 May, 2011</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>There&#8217;s a website called <a href="http://www.quora.com/">Quora</a> where people can ask and answer questions of all sorts.  Lots of people use it, so Curtis Faith suggested that we&mdash;that is, everyone here reading this blog&mdash;try answering some of the questions there.  That sounded like a nice idea, so now there&#8217;s a  &#8216;topic&#8217; on Quora called <a href="http://www.quora.com/Azimuth-Project-1">Azimuth Project</a>.  The questions we tackle will be listed there, so people can easily find them.</p>
<p>To get the ball rolling, Curtis posted this question:</p>
<p><b><a href="http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-one-best-thing-everyone-could-do-to-slow-down-climate-change">What is the one best thing everyone could do to slow down climate change?</a></b></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re like me, the first thing you&#8217;ll want to do is question the question.  Are we really looking for the <i><b>one</b></i> best thing <i><b>everyone</b></i> could do?   Everyone in the world, including the billion poorest people?  </p>
<p>In that case, many answers that leap to mind are no good.  We can&#8217;t say &#8220;take fewer airplane trips&#8221; because most of those people don&#8217;t take airplane trips to begin with.  We can&#8217;t say &#8220;drive less&#8221; because most of those people don&#8217;t have cars.  And so on.  It&#8217;s no fair!  We need an easier question!  </p>
<p>Well&#8230; let&#8217;s not try to second-guess the question.  It&#8217;s actually fun to take it seriously and try to answer it.  It&#8217;ll force us to think about the world as a whole, instead of the sins of our rich neighbors.</p>
<p>Here are 50 tips for how to fight global warming from <a href="http://globalwarming-facts.info/50-tips.html">Global Warming Facts</a>.  Could any of <i>these</i> be the right answer?   How many of these are things that <i>everyone</i> on this Earth can do? </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Replace a regular incandescent light bulb with a compact fluorescent light bulb (cfl)</strong><br />
CFLs use 60% less energy than a regular bulb. This simple switch will save about 300 pounds of carbon dioxide a year.<br />
We recommend you <a href="http://clickserve.cc-dt.com/link/click?lid=41000000026494257" rel="nofollow">purchase your CFL bulbs at 1000bulbs.com</a>, they have great deals on both screw-in and plug-in light bulbs.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Install a programmable thermostat</strong><br />
Programmable thermostats will automatically lower the heat or air conditioning at night and raise them again in the morning. They can save you $100 a year on your energy bill.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Move your thermostat down 2° in winter and up 2° in summer</strong><br />
Almost half of the energy we use in our homes goes to heating and cooling. You could save about 2,000 pounds of carbon dioxide a year with this simple adjustment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Clean or replace filters on your furnace and air conditioner</strong><br />
Cleaning a dirty air filter can save 350 pounds of carbon dioxide a year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Choose energy efficient appliances when making new purchases</strong><br />
Look for the <a href="http://www.energystar.gov">Energy Star</a> label on new appliances to  choose the most <a href="http://www.buyenergyefficient.org/">energy efficient products</a><br />
available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Do not leave appliances on standby</strong><br />
Use the &#8220;on/off&#8221; function on the machine itself. A TV set that&#8217;s switched on for 3 hours a day  (the average time Europeans spend watching TV) and in standby mode during the remaining 21 hours  uses about 40% of its energy in standby mode.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wrap your water heater in an insulation blanket</strong><br />
You’ll save 1,000 pounds of carbon dioxide a year with this simple action. You can save another 550 pounds per year by setting the thermostat no higher than 50°C. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Move your fridge and freezer</strong><br />
Placing them next to the cooker or boiler consumes much more energy than if they were standing on  their own. For example, if you put them in a hot cellar room where the room temperature is 30-35ºC,  energy use is almost double and causes an extra 160 kg of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for fridges per year and  320 kg for freezers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Defrost old fridges and freezers regularly</strong><br />
Even better is to replace them with newer models, which all have automatic defrost cycles and are  generally up to two times more energy-efficient than their predecessors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t let heat escape from your house over a long period</strong><br />
When airing your house, open the windows for only a few minutes. If you leave a small opening all  day long, the energy needed to keep it warm inside during six cold months (10ºC or less outside  temperature) would result in almost 1 ton of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Replace your old single-glazed windows with double-glazing</strong><br />
This requires a bit of upfront investment, but will halve the energy lost through windows and pay  off in the long term. If you go for the best the market has to offer (wooden-framed double-glazed  units with low-emission glass and filled with argon gas), you can even save more than 70% of the energy lost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Get a home energy audit</strong><br />
Many utilities offer free home energy audits to find where your home is poorly insulated or energy  inefficient. You can save up to 30% off your energy bill and 1,000 pounds of carbon dioxide a year.  Energy Star can help you find an energy specialist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cover your pots while cooking</strong><br />
Doing so can save a lot of the energy needed for preparing the dish. Even better are pressure cookers  and steamers: they can save around 70%!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use the washing machine or dishwasher only when they are full</strong><br />
If you need to use it when it is half full, then use the half-load or economy setting. There is also no  need to set the temperatures high. Nowadays detergents are so efficient that they get your clothes and  dishes clean at low temperatures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Take a shower instead of a bath</strong><br />
A shower takes up to four times less energy than a bath. To maximize the energy saving, avoid power  showers and use low-flow showerheads, which are cheap and provide the same comfort.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use less hot water</strong><br />
It takes a lot of energy to heat water. You can use less hot water by installing a low flow showerhead (350 pounds of carbon dioxide saved per year) and washing your clothes in cold or warm water (500 pounds saved per year) instead of hot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use a clothesline instead of a dryer whenever possible</strong><br />
You can save 700 pounds of carbon dioxide when you air dry your clothes for 6 months out of the year.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Insulate and weatherize your home</strong><br />Properly insulating your walls and ceilings can save 25% of your home heating bill and 2,000 pounds  of carbon dioxide a year. Caulking and weather-stripping can save another 1,700 pounds per year.  <a href="http://www.buyenergyefficient.org/">Energy Efficient</a> has more information on how to better insulate your home.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be sure you’re recycling at home</strong><br />
You can save 2,400 pounds of carbon dioxide a year by recycling half of the waste your household generates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Recycle your organic waste</strong><br />
Around 3% of the greenhouse gas emissions through the methane is released by decomposing bio-degradable waste.  By recycling organic waste or composting it if you have a garden, you can help eliminate this problem! Just make  sure that you compost it properly, so it decomposes with sufficient oxygen, otherwise your compost will cause methane emissions and smell foul.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Buy intelligently</strong><br /> One bottle of 1.5l requires less energy and produces less waste than three bottles of 0.5l. As well, buy  recycled paper products: it takes less 70 to 90% less energy to make recycled paper and it prevents the loss  of forests worldwide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Choose products that come with little packaging and buy refills when you can</strong><br />
You will also cut down on waste production and energy use&#8230; another help against <a style="color:#000;text-decoration:none;" rel="PreventCopyingWithoutAttribution" href="http://globalwarming-facts.info/">global warming</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reuse your shopping bag</strong><br />
When shopping, it saves energy and waste to use a reusable bag instead of accepting a disposable one in each shop. Waste not only discharges CO2 and methane into the atmosphere, it can also pollute the air,  groundwater and soil.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reduce waste</strong><br />
Most products we buy cause greenhouse gas emissions in one or another way, e.g. during production and distribution. By taking your lunch in a reusable lunch box instead of a disposable one, you save the energy needed to produce new lunch boxes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Plant a tree</strong><br />
A single tree will absorb one ton of carbon dioxide over its lifetime. Shade provided by trees can also reduce your air conditioning bill by 10 to 15%. The <a href="http://www.arborday.org/">Arbor Day Foundation</a> has information on planting and provides trees you can plant with membership.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Switch to green power</strong><br />
In many areas, you can switch to energy generated by clean, renewable sources such as wind and solar.  In some of these, you can even get refunds by government if you choose to switch to a clean energy producer,  and you can also earn money by selling the energy you produce and don&#8217;t use for yourself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Buy locally grown and produced foods</strong><br />
The average meal in the United States travels 1,200 miles from the farm to your plate. Buying locally will  save fuel and keep money in your community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Buy fresh foods instead of frozen</strong><br />
Frozen food uses 10 times more energy to produce.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Seek out and support local farmers markets</strong><br /> They reduce the amount of energy required to grow and transport the food to you by one fifth. Seek farmer’s markets in your area, and go for them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Buy organic foods as much as possible</strong><br /> Organic soils capture and store carbon dioxide at much higher levels than soils from conventional farms. If we grew all of our corn and soybeans organically, we’d remove 580 billion pounds of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere! </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Eat less meat</strong><br /> Methane is the second most significant greenhouse gas and cows are one of the greatest methane emitters. Their grassy diet and multiple stomachs cause them to produce methane, which they exhale with every breath. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reduce the number of miles you drive by walking, biking, carpooling or taking mass transit wherever possible</strong><br />
Avoiding just 10 miles of driving every week would eliminate about 500 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions a year! Look for transit options in your area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Start a carpool with your coworkers or classmates</strong><br />
Sharing a ride with someone just 2 days a week will reduce your carbon dioxide emissions by 1,590 pounds a year. <a href="http://www.erideshare.com/" rel="nofollow">eRideShare.com</a> runs a free service connecting North American commuters and travelers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>	<strong>Don&#8217;t leave an empty roof rack on your car</strong><br />
This can increase fuel consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by up to 10% due to wind resistance and the extra weight &#8211; removing it is a better idea.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Keep your car tuned up</strong><br />
Regular maintenance helps improve fuel efficiency and reduces emissions. When just 1% of car owners properly maintain their cars, nearly a billion pounds of carbon dioxide are kept out of the atmosphere. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Drive carefully and do not waste fuel</strong><br />
You can reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by readjusting your driving style. Choose proper gears, do not abuse the gas pedal, use the engine brake instead of the pedal brake when possible and turn off your engine when your vehicle is motionless for more than one minute. By readjusting your driving style you can save money on both fuel and car maintenance. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Check your tires weekly to make sure they’re properly inflated</strong><br />
Proper <a href="http://www.carcare.org/Tires_Wheels/inflation.shtml" rel="nofollow">tire inflation</a> can improve gas mileage by more than 3%. Since every gallon of gasoline saved keeps 20 pounds of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, every increase in fuel efficiency makes a difference! </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>When it is time for a new car, choose a more fuel efficient vehicle</strong><br />
You can save 3,000 pounds of carbon dioxide every year if your new car gets only 3 miles per gallon more than your current one. You can get up to 60 miles per gallon with a hybrid! You can find information on fuel efficiency on <a href="http://www.fueleconomy.gov/" rel="nofollow">FuelEconomy</a> and on <a href="http://www.greencars.com/">GreenCars</a> websites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Try car sharing</strong><br />
Need a car but don’t want to buy one? Community car sharing organizations provide access to a car and your membership fee covers gas, maintenance and insurance. Many companies – such as  <a href="http://www.flexcar.com/" rel="nofollow">Flexcar</a> &#8211; offer low emission or  hybrid cars too! Also, see <a href="http://www.zipcar.com/" rel="nofollow">ZipCar</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong> Try telecommuting from home</strong><br />
Telecommuting can help you drastically reduce the number of miles you drive every week.  For more information, check out the <a href="http://www.telcoa.org/" rel="nofollow">Telework Coalition</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fly less</strong><br />
Air travel produces large amounts of emissions so reducing how much you fly by even one or two trips a year can reduce your emissions significantly. You can also <a href="http://www.nativeenergy.com/">offset your air travel carbon emissions</a> by investing in renewable energy projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Encourage your school or business to reduce emissions</strong><br />
You can extend your positive influence on global warming well beyond your home by actively encouraging other to take action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Join the virtual march</strong><br />
The Stop Global Warming Virtual March is a non-political effort to bring people concerned about global warming together in one place. <a href="http://www.stopglobalwarming.org/">Add your voice</a> to the hundreds of<br />
thousands of other people urging action on this issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Encourage the switch to renewable energy</strong><br />
Successfully combating global warming requires a national transition to renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and biomass. These technologies are ready to be deployed more widely but there are regulatory barriers impeding them. U.S. citizens, take action to break down those barriers with <a href="http://www.votesolar.org/">Vote Solar</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Protect and conserve forest worldwide</strong><br />
Forests play a critical role in global warming: they store carbon. When forests are burned or cut down, their stored carbon is release into the atmosphere &#8211; deforestation now accounts for about 20% of carbon dioxide emissions each year.  <a href="http://www.conservation.org/learn/forests/Pages/overview.aspx">Conservation International</a> has more information on saving forests from global warming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider the impact of your investments</strong><br />
If you invest your money, you should consider the impact that your investments and savings will have on global warming. Check out  <a href="http://www.socialinvest.org/" rel="nofollow">SocialInvest</a> and <a href="http://www.ceres.org/" rel="nofollow">Ceres</a> to can learn more about how to ensure your money is being invested in companies, products and projects that address issues related to climate change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Make your city cool</strong><br />
Cities and states around the country have taken action to stop global warming by passing innovative transportation and energy saving legislation. If you&#8217;re in the U.S., join the <a href="http://coolcities.us/">cool cities list</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tell Congress to act</strong><br />
The McCain Lieberman Climate Stewardship and Innovation Act would set a firm limit on carbon dioxide emissions and then use free market incentives to lower costs, promote efficiency and spur innovation. <a href="http://action.environmentaldefense.org/campaign/globalwarming_petition" rel="nofollow">Tell</a> your representative to support it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Make sure your voice is heard!</strong><br />
Americans must have a stronger commitment from their government in order to stop global warming and implement solutions and such a commitment won’t come without a dramatic increase in citizen lobbying for new laws with teeth. <a href="http://www.vote-smart.org/pre_10.htm" rel="nofollow">Get the facts</a>  about U.S. politicians and candidates at Project Vote Smart and  <a href="http://www.lcv.org/scorecard/">The League of Conservation Voters</a>.

				<h2><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/05/19/the-melting-of-greenland-and-west-antarctica/" rel="bookmark">The Melting of Greenland and West&nbsp;Antarctica</a></h2>
				<small>19 May, 2011</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>Ice is melting at an accelerating pace in Greenland and the Antarctic.  You may know all about this.  But maybe like me you&#8217;re still just catching up on the basics.   If so, here&#8217;s a quick intro.</p>
<p>If all the ice in Antarctica melted, it would raise the sea by 61 meters!  Such mammoth sea level changes do happen:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://www.cmar.csiro.au/sealevel/sl_hist_intro.html"><img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.cmar.csiro.au/sealevel/images/fig_hist_1.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>But it seems they take millennia.  In the shorter term, meaning the next century or two, people tend to focus their concern on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Antarctic_Ice_Sheet">WAIS</a>:</p>
<div align="center">

<p>If the entire WAIS melted, it would make sea levels rise 4.8 meters.   Another region of concern is Greenland: if all the ice there melted, it would cause a global sea level rise of 7.2 meters. This would inundate many of the world’s coastal cities.   </p>
<p>Luckily, it seems no reputable glaciologists think the WAIS or Greenland will completely melt in the coming century.  But amount of melting of these ice sheets has been a big challenge to predict.  </p>
<p>The last International Panel on Climate Change report, back in 2007, took a pretty conservative stance, and assumed these ice sheets would melt at a slow and more or less constant rate until 2100.  Their <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch10s10-es-8-sea-level.html">conclusion</a> was that about 75% of sea level rise would be caused by the oceans expanding as they warmed.  The melting of small glaciers, ice caps and Greenland would account for most of the rest.  The Antarctic, they believed, would actually provide a small net <i>reduction</i> in sea levels, with increases in snowfall more than enough to outweigh the effects of melting.  They predicted an overall sea level rise of between 0.18 and 0.59 meters, with most of the uncertainty arising from different assumptions about what the world economy will do.</p>
<p>However, almost as soon as the 4th IPCC report was released, evidence started accumulating that the melting of Greenland and the West Antarctic Ice Sheet were speeding up.  For example:</p>

<p>This graph, taken from <a href="http://www.skepticalscience.com/Accelerating-ice-loss-from-Antarctica-and-Greenland.html">Skeptical Science</a>, shows <a href="http://www.faculty.uci.edu/profile.cfm?faculty_id=5518">Isabella Velicogna&#8217;s</a> estimates of the mass of the Greenland ice sheet. Unfiltered data are blue crosses. Data filtered to eliminate seasonal variations are shown as red crosses. The best fit by a quadratic function is shown in green.  The data came from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment&mdash;or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_Recovery_and_Climate_Experiment#How_GRACE_works">GRACE</a>, for short.  This remarkable project uses a pair of satellites to accurately measure small variations from place to place in the Earth&#8217;s gravitational field.  When ice sheets melt, GRACE can detect it.</p>
<p>The big news, of course, was that the melting is speeding up.  Here&#8217;s the same sort of graph for Antarctica, again created by Velicogna:</p>

<p>&bull; I. Velicogna, <a href="http://pages.csam.montclair.edu/~chopping/rs/grace_ice-loss.pdf">Increasing rates of ice mass loss from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets revealed by GRACE</a>, <i><a href="http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2009/2009GL040222.shtml">Geophysical Research Letters</a></i>, <b>36</b> (2009), L19503. </p>
<p>More recently, <a href="http://www.faculty.uci.edu/profile.cfm?faculty_id=5467">Eric Rignot <i>et al</i></a> compared GRACE data to another way of keeping track of these ice sheets:</p>
<p>&bull; Eric Rignot, <a href="http://sciences.blogs.liberation.fr/files/calottes-fondent.pdf">Acceleration of the contribution of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets to sea level rise</a>, <a href="http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2011/2011GL046583.shtml"><i>Geophysical Research Letters</i></a> <b>38</b>, L05503.</p>
<p> Satellites and radio echo soundings measure ice leaving these sheets, while regional atmospheric climate model data can be used to estimate the amount of snow being added.  The difference should be the overall loss of ice.  </p>
<p>These graphs show Rignot&#8217;s results:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/524783main_earth20110308fig-full.jpg"><br />
<img width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.nasa.gov/images/content/524783main_earth20110308fig-full.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>Graph <b>a</b> is Greenland, graph <b>b</b> is Antarctica and graph <b>c</b> is the total of both.  These graphs show not the amount of ice, but the <i>rate at which the amount of ice is changing</i>, in gigatonnes per year.  So, a line sloping down would mean that the ice loss is accelerating at a constant rate. </p>
<p>By fitting a line to satellite and atmospheric data, Rignot&#8217;s team found that over the last 18 years, Greenland has been losing an average of 22 gigatonnes more ice each year.  Antarctica has been losing an average of 14.5 gigatonnes more each year.  </p>
<p>But also note the black versus the red on the top two graphs!  The GRACE data is in red.  The other approach is in black.  They match fairly well, though of course not perfectly.  </p>
<p>The upshot?  <a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2011-070">Rignot says</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That ice sheets will dominate future sea level rise is not surprising&mdash;they hold a lot more ice mass than mountain glaciers.  What is surprising is this increased contribution by the ice sheets is already happening. If present trends continue, sea level is likely to be significantly higher than levels projected by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2007. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>But how much sea level rise, exactly?  Opinions still vary.   A recent <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/NRC+climate+stabilization+targets">National Academy of Sciences</a> report said at least 0.6 meters by 2100.  But this still doesn&#8217;t include any melting of Greenland or the Antarctic!</p>
<p>This paper tries to take Greenland and the Antarctic into account:</p>
<p>&bull; S. Jevrejeva, J. C. Moore and A. Grinsted, How will sea level respond to changes in natural and anthropogenic forcings by 2100?, <a href="http://www.agu.org/journals/ABS/2010/2010GL042947.shtml"><i>Geophysical Research Letters</i></a> <b>37</b> (2010), L07703.</p>
<p>The authors say their estimates are in line with past sea level responses to temperature change, and they suggest that estimates based on ice and ocean thermal responses alone may be misleading.  With six different IPCC scenarios they estimate a sea level rise of 0.6–1.6 meters by 2100, and are confident the rise will be between 0.59 and 1.8 meters.</p>
<p>This paper suggests an upper bound on sea level rise 2 meters per century (if you max out everything) and a more realistic upper bound of 1 meter/century for this century (it could accelerate later):</p>
<p>&bull; W. T. Pfeffer, J. T. Harper and S. O&#8217;Neel, Kinematic constraints on glacier contributions to 21st-century sea-level rise, <i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/321/5894/1340.abstract">Science</a></i> <b>321</b> (2008), 1340-1343.</p>
<p>So, <a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/09/on-straw-men-and-greenland-tad-pfeffer-responds/">except for James Hansen</a>, it sounds like most people would agree on an upper bound of about 2 meters of sea level rise by 2100.  This is considerably more than the 4th IPCC report: remember, that gave an upper bound of about 0.6 meters. </p>
<p>I guess one moral is: stay tuned for further developments. </p>

				<small>15 May, 2011</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>Here are some conferences on climate change and related issues, specially designed to get mathematicians interacting with scientists who work on these things!  If you know of any more coming up, please let me know.  These ones are sponsored by the <a href="http://www.mathclimate.org/">Mathematics and Climate Research Network</a>, a US-based organization, but there are probably others.</p>
<p>&bull; <b><a href="http://www.siam.org/meetings/ds11">Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) Conference on Applications of Dynamical Systems</a></b>, Snowbird, Utah, US, 22-26 May, 2011.  Organized by Jonathan Dawes and Vivien Kirk. </p>
<p>Climate modeling and data assimilation are among the themes of this conference, which is aimed at starting communication between mathematicians who develop dynamical systems techniques and the applied scientists who use them.</p>
<p>&bull; <b><a href="http://mbi.osu.edu/2010/ws6description.html">Mathematical Biosciences Institute (MBI) Workshop on Ocean Ecologies and their Physical Habitats in a Changing Climate</a></b>, Columbus, Ohio, US, June 2011.  Organized by <a href="http://www.math.utah.edu/~golden/">Ken Golden</a>, <a href="http://www.amath.unc.edu/Faculty/ckrtj/">Chris Jones</a>, <a href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/~kaper/">Hans Kaper,</a> and <a href="http://www.bowdoin.edu/faculty/m/mlzeeman/">Mary Lou Zeeman</a>.	</p>
<p>The goal of this workshop is to bring together biologists studying ocean and polar ecologies; oceanographers, biogeochemists, and climate scientists studying the changing physical habitats; and mathematicians with ecological and physical expertise. The interactions between ocean ecological systems and their physical environments may dramatically impact both marine biodiversity and the planetary response to the changing atmosphere. The types of mathematics used to model ecological and physical processes are typically quite different. The team organizing this workshop anticipates interesting new mathematical challenges arising from combining these different approaches. The workshop will focus on two main themes:</p>
<p>1)  polar and sea ice ecologies;</p>
<p>2)  phytoplankton and the carbon cycle.</p>
<p>&bull; <b><a href="http://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=10879">Minisymposium on the Dynamics of the Earth&#8217;s Climate</a></b>, as part of the International Congress on Industrial and Applied Mathematics (ICIAM), Vancouver, British Columbia, July 2011.<br />
Organized by Hans G. Kaper, Mary C. Silber and Mary Lou Zeeman.</p>
<p>The speakers in this mini-symposium will highlight some interesting mathematical problems that have come from climate science and can be addressed with techniques developed in the dynamical systems community.  </p>
<p>&bull; <b><a href="http://www.ima.org.uk/viewItem.cfm?cit_id=383274">Institute of Mathematics and its Applications (IMA) Conference on Mathematics of the Climate System</a></b>, University of Reading, United Kingdom, 12-15 September, 2011.  Organized by Paul Williams, Colin Cotter, Mike Cullen, Mike Davey, Christopher Ferro, John Huthnance and David Stainforth.</p>
<p>This conference is about the construction and use of mathematical models of the climate system.  The conference will focus on three related topics:</p>
<p>1) the extraction of mathematical models from climate data and climate-model output (homogenisation, stochastic model reduction, bistability and metastable states, low frequency variability, data-driven coarse-graining, set-oriented methods, trend identification, time-series analysis);</p>
<p>2) reduced models and their dynamics (linear response theory, bifurcations, extreme events, uncertainty);</p>
<p>3) testing hypotheses about the climate system using statistical frameworks (emulators, Bayesian methods, nonparametric methods, equitability).</p>

				<h2><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/04/21/stabilization-wedges-part-5/" rel="bookmark">Stabilization Wedges (Part&nbsp;5)</a></h2>
				<small>21 April, 2011</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>In 2004, Pacala and Socolow laid out a list of ways we can battle global warming using current technologies.  They said that to avoid serious trouble, we need to choose seven <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Stabilization+wedges">&#8216;stabilization wedges&#8217;</a>: that is, seven ways to cut carbon emissions by 1 gigatonne per year within 50 years.  They listed 15 wedges to choose from, and I&#8217;ve told you about them here:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/11/16/stabilization-wedges/">Part 1</a> &#8211; efficiency and conservation.</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/11/23/stabilization-wedges-part-2/">Part 2</a> &#8211; shifting from coal to natural gas, carbon capture and storage.</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/12/17/stabilization-wedges-part-3/">Part 3</a> &#8211; nuclear power and renewable energy.</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/01/16/stabilization-wedges-part-4/">Part 4</a> &#8211; reforestation, good soil management.</p>
<p>According to Pacala:</p>
<blockquote><p>
 The message was a very positive one: &#8220;gee, we can solve this problem: there are <i>lots</i> of ways to solve it, and lots of ways for the marketplace to solve it.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I find that interesting, because to me each wedge seems like a gargantuan enterprise&mdash;and taken together, they seem like the Seven Labors of Hercules.  They&#8217;re technically feasible, but who has the stomach for them?  I fear things need to get worse before we come to our senses and take action at the scale that&#8217;s required.  </p>
<p>Anyway, that&#8217;s just me.  But three years ago, Pacala publicly reconsidered his ideas for a very different reason.  Based on new evidence, he gave a <a>talk at Stanford</a> where he said:</p>
<blockquote><p>
 It&#8217;s at least possible that we&#8217;ve already let this thing go too far, and that the biosphere may start to fall apart on us, even if we do all this.  We may have to fall back on some sort of dramatic Plan B.  We have to stay vigilant as a species.
</p></blockquote>
<p>You can watch his talk here:</p>

<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="450" height="390" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2X2u7-R3Wrc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span></div>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty damned interesting: he&#8217;s a good speaker.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a dry summary of a few key points.   I won&#8217;t try to add caveats: I&#8217;m sure he would add some himself in print, but I&#8217;d rather keep the message simple.  I also won&#8217;t try to update his information!  Not in this blog entry, anyway.  But I&#8217;ll ask some questions, and I&#8217;ll be delighted if you help me out on those.</p>
<h4>Emissions targets</h4>
<p>First, Pacala&#8217;s review of different carbon emissions targets.</p>
<p>The old scientific view, circa 1998: if we could keep the CO<sub>2</sub> from <i>doubling</i> from its preindustrial level of 280 parts per million, that would count as a success.   Namely, most of the &#8216;monsters behind the door&#8217; would not come out: continental ice sheets falling into the sea and swamping coastal cities, the collapse of the Atlantic ocean circulation, a <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16322101">drought in the Sahel region of Africa</a>, etcetera.</p>
<p>Many experts say we&#8217;d be lucky to get away with CO<sub>2</sub> merely doubling.  At current burn rates we&#8217;ll double it by 2050, and <i>quadruple</i> it by the end of this century. We&#8217;ve got enough fossil fuels to send it to <i>seven times</i> its preindustrial levels.</p>
<p>Doubling it would take us to 560 parts per million.  A lot of people think that&#8217;s too high to be safe.  But going for lower levels gets harder:</p>
<p>&bull; In Pacala and Socolow&#8217;s original paper, they talked about <b>keeping CO<sub>2</sub> below 500 ppm</b>.  This would require keeping CO<sub>2</sub> emissions constant until 2050.  This could be achieved by <b>a radical decarbonization of the economies of rich countries, while allowing carbon emissions in poor countries to grow almost freely until that time</b>.</p>
<p>&bull; For a long time the IPCC and many organizations advocated <b>keeping CO<sub>2</sub> below 450 ppm</b>.  This would require cutting CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 50% by 2050, which could be achieved by <b>a radical decarbonization in rich countries, and moderate decarbonization in poor countries</b>.</p>
<p>&bull; But by 2008 the IPCC and many groups wanted a cap of 2&deg;C global warming, or <b>keeping CO<sub>2</sub> below 430 ppm</b>.  This would mean cutting CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 80% by 2050, which would require <b>a radical decarbonization in both rich and poor countries</b>.</p>
<p>The difference here is what poor people have to do.  The rich countries need to radically cut carbon emissions in <i>all</i> these scenarios.  In the USA, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America%27s_Climate_Security_Act_of_2007">Lieberman-Warner bill</a> would have forced the complete decarbonization of the economy by 2050.  </p>
<p>Then, Pacala spoke about 3 things that make him nervous:</p>
<h4>1. Faster emissions growth </h4>
<p>A <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/104/47/18866.full">2007 paper by Canadell <i>et al</i></a> pointed out that starting in 2000, fossil fuel emissions started growing at 3% per year instead of the earlier figure of 1.5%.  This could be due to China&#8217;s industrialization.  Will this keep up in years to come?  If so, the original Pacala-Socolow plan won&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>(How much, exactly, did the economic recession change this story?)</p>
<h4>2. The ocean sink</h4>
<p>Each year fossil fuel burning puts about 8 gigatons of carbon in the atmosphere.  The ocean absorbs about 2 gigatons and the land absorbs about 2, leaving about 4 gigatons in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>However, as CO<sub>2</sub> emissions rise, the oceanic CO<sub>2</sub> sink has been growing less than anticipated.  This seems to be due to a change in wind patterns, itself a consequence of global warming.  </p>
<p>(What&#8217;s the latest story here?)</p>
<h4>3. The land sink </h4>
<p>As the CO<sub>2</sub> levels go up, people expected plants to grow better and suck up more CO<sub>2</sub>.    In the third IPCC report, models predicted that by 2050, plants will be drawing down 6 gigatonnes more carbon per year than they do now!  The fourth IPCC report was similar.</p>
<p>This is huge: remember that right now we emit about 8 gigatonnes per year.  Indeed, this effect, called CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization, could be the difference between the land being a big carbon <i>sink</i> and a big carbon <i>source</i>.  Why a carbon source?  For one thing, without the plants sucking up CO<sub>2</sub>, temperatures will rise faster, and the Amazon rainforest may start to die, and permafrost in the Arctic may release more greenhouse gases (especially methane) as it melts.    </p>
<p>In a simulation run by Pacala, where he deliberately assumed that plants <i>fail</i> to suck up more carbon dioxide, these effects happened and the biosphere dumped a huge amount of extra CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere: the equivalent of 26 stabilization wedges.</p>
<p>So, <b>plans based on the IPCC models are essentially counting on plants to save us from ourselves</b>.  </p>
<p>But is there any reason to think plants might <i>not</i> suck up CO<sub>2</sub> at the predicted rates?  </p>
<p>Maybe.  First, people have actually grown forests in doubled CO<sub>2</sub> conditions to see how much faster plants grow then.  But the <a href="http://face.env.duke.edu/description.cfm">classic experiment</a> along these lines used <i>young</i> trees.  In 2005, <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/309/5739/1360">K&ouml;rner <i>et al</i></a> did an experiment using <i>mature</i> trees&#8230; and they didn&#8217;t see them growing any faster!    </p>
<p>Second, models in the third IPCC report assumed that as plants grew faster, they&#8217;d have no trouble getting all the <i>nitrogen</i> they need.  But <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/302/5650/1512.summary">Hungate <i>et al</i></a> have argued otherwise.  On the other hand, <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~lhedin/Project9.htm">Alexander Barron</a> discovered that some tropical plants were unexpectedly good at ramping up the rate at which they grab ahold of nitrogen from the atmosphere.  But on the third hand, that only applies to the tropics.  And on the fourth hand&mdash;a complicated problem like this requires one of those Indian gods with lots of hands&mdash;nitrogen isn&#8217;t the only limiting factor to worry about: there&#8217;s also phosphorus, for example.</p>
<p>Pacala goes on and discusses even more complicating factors.  But his main point is simple.  The details of CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization matter a <i>lot</i>.  It could make the difference between their original plan being roughly good enough&#8230; and being <i>nowhere near good enough!</i></p>
<p>(What&#8217;s the latest story here?)</p>

			<div class="textwidget"><p>You can <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics">include math in your comments using LaTeX</a>,  but you need to do it this way:</p>
<p>&#036;latex  E = mc^2&#036;</p>
<p>You need the word 'latex' right after the first dollar sign, and it needs a space after it.  Double dollar signs don't work, and other limitations apply, some described <a href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/latex/">here</a>.  You can't preview comments here, but I'm happy to fix errors.</p>
