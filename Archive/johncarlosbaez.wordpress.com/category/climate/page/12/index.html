<p>But beware: I&#8217;m still enjoying the case of scotch I won from David Ring. I bet there&#8217;d be no &#8220;strong evidence for supersymmetry&#8221; within the first year of operation of the Large Hadron Collider.
</p></blockquote>
<p>It took a couple of days, but I finally got someone willing to take me up on this.  And&#8212;surprise!&#8212;it was none other than <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Frederik+De+Roo">Frederick De Roo</a>, one of the key contributors to the Azimuth Project.</p>
<p>But he&#8217;s playing for higher stakes than I&#8217;d expected:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Hi John,</p>
<p>actually I&#8217;m willing to take a bet.</p>
<p>I propose to bet (even though I don&#8217;t believe it) that</p>
<blockquote><p>
  neutrinos can go faster than light
</p></blockquote>
<p>The loser of the bet will promise to the winner not to fly for one whole year! (for a year chosen within a specified number of years after the bet has expired)</p>
<p>How about that? The earth wins regardless who&#8217;s right ;-)
</p></blockquote>
<p>I asked him if we could discuss the details here, and he said okay.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a tricky business. While I&#8217;ve got the odds on my side, I&#8217;ve also got more to lose!  </p>
<p>Frederik lives in Europe, where there are lots of trains.  His idea of a fun vacation is a month-long bike trip.  What&#8217;s he got to lose?</p>
<p>I could easily survive a year of not flying to conferences.  It would hurt a bit.  Still, I&#8217;d say yes in a minute if it were just up to me.  But Lisa and I have permanent positions at the University of California in Riverside, and we&#8217;re trying to work out a deal where we work in Singapore every summer.  So, I can&#8217;t really agree to this bet unless I get her okay!  </p>
<p>How do I convince a non-physicist&#8212;and not just any non-physicist, but my <i>wife</i>&#8212;that it&#8217;s really, <i>really</i> safe to bet a summer of being together on the possibility that neutrinos go faster than light?  </p>
<p>We spent seven years on opposite sides of the country before she got a job at UC Riverside.  We promised we&#8217;d never do something like that again.  And now I&#8217;m saying &#8220;oh, don&#8217;t worry, dear: special relativity is very well tested.&#8221;  If you haven&#8217;t been in this situation, you don&#8217;t know how unconvincing that sounds.</p>
<p>Should I look into cruises from Southern California to Singapore?  How long do those take, anyway?  It would be a bummer to get there only have to head straight back.</p>

<p>What would you say, Frederik, if I changed the the terms of the bet to something like this?  If I lose the bet, for each plane trip I take during the specified year, I&#8217;ll donate $10,000 to your favorite environmental organization.  Carbon offsets, or whatever you like.  That way if I lose, I suffer, but not my marriage.</p>

					<p>The <a href="http://climaterealityproject.org/">Climate Reality Project</a> is planning a presentation called &#8220;24 Hours of Reality&#8221; beginning at 7 pm Central Time on September 14th, arguing for the connection between more extreme weather and climate change.  &#8220;There will be a full-on assault on climate skeptics, exploring where they get their funding from.&#8221;</p>
<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="560" height="345" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PY-mboZkhD0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span>
<p>The Washington Post has an interview with Al Gore about this project:</p>
<p>&bull; Brad Plumer, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/al-gore-the-message-still-has-to-be-about-the-reality-were-facing/2011/09/12/gIQAZjNxMK_blog.html">Al Gore: ‘The message still has to be about the reality we’re facing’ </a>, <i>Washington Post</i>, 12 September 2011.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll quote a bit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Brad Plumer</b>: “An Inconvenient Truth” was basically a primer on global warming—the causes, the problems it creates, the ways we can avert it. So what more is there to add? How will this new presentation be different?</p>
<p><b>Al Gore</b>: It’s very different—a few of the images are the same, but 95 percent of the slides are completely new. The science linking the increased frequency and severity of extreme weather to the climate crisis has matured tremendously in the last couple of years. Think about the last year, we’ve had floods in Pakistan displacing 20 million people and further destabilizing a nuclear-armed country. We’ve had drought and wildfires in Russia. In Australia you’ve got floods the size of France and Germany combined. Then there’s drought in Texas—out of 254 counties in Texas, 252 are on fire. I’m talking to you from Nashville, where the city lost the equivalent of an entire year’s budget from recent floods—the area has never been flooded like this before, so no one had flood insurance.</p>
<p>That’s the reality we’ve got to focus on. This presentation is a defense of the science and the scientists, against the timeworn claims by deniers.</p>
<p><b>BP</b>: Now, whenever a natural disaster happens—say, a flood or a wildfire—you typically see scientists quoted in the press saying, “Well, it’s hard to attribute any single event to global warming, although this is the sort of event we should see more of as the planet warms.” As I understand it, this sort of extra-careful hedge is becoming outdated. Scientists actually are <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/romm/2010/06/14/206133/ncar-trenberth-global-warming-extreme-weather-rain-deluge/">making tighter connections</a> between current disasters and climate change, correct?</p>
<p><b>AG</b>: Yes, that shift in the way scientists describe the linkage is one of the elements of this new slideshow. It’s a subtle but extremely important shift. They used to say that the climate crisis changes the odds of extreme weather events—this was the old metaphor of “loading the dice.” Now, they say there’s not only a greater likelihood of rolling 12s, but we’re actually loading 13s and could soon be rolling 15s and 16s. As scientists like James Hansen [of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies] and Kevin Trenberth [of the National Center for Atmospheric Research] point out, the changes brought about by man-made global-warming pollution have reached the stage that every event is now being affected by it in some way.</p>
<p>In the last 30 years, for instance, we’ve seen water vapor above the oceans increase by 4 percent, and many storms reach as far as 2,000 miles out to collect water vapor. So when you have a 4 percent increase over such a large area, the storms are now fueled with more water vapor than was the case 30 years ago. That means we’re getting larger downpours. And in drought-prone areas, we’re seeing increasing intervals between downpours, which is one of several reasons why we’re seeing extreme droughts.</p>
<p><b>BP</b>: Now, you’re talking about presenting the stark facts as a way of persuading people that climate change is a problem. Yet when you <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/how-the-tea-party-changed-the-climate-debate/2011/09/07/gIQAVMMh9J_blog.html">look at polls on climate belief</a>, one thing that stands out is that the people most dismissive of global warming tend to be the most confident that they have all the information they need. Doesn’t that suggest there’s a point at which more information doesn’t actually persuade anyone?</p>
<p><b>AG</b>: Well, that logic hasn’t led deniers to stop pressing the inaccurate disinformation about climate science. And the fact is that quite a few of the large carbon polluters and their allies in the ideological right wing have been spending hundreds of millions of dollars per year to mislead people. Have you read Naomi Oreske’s book <i><a href="http://www.merchantsofdoubt.org/">Merchants of Doubt</a></i>? The tobacco companies a few decades ago pioneered this organized disinformation technique to create artificial doubt about the science of their product—they hired actors to dress them up as doctors and had them say, “I’m a doctor, there’s nothing wrong with smoking cigarettes; in fact, it’ll make you feel better.” And some of the same people who took money from tobacco companies to lie about tobacco science are now taking money from large carbon polluters to lie about the reality of the climate crisis.</p>
<p><b>BP</b>: Okay, but taking that opposition is a given, there’s been a lot of discussion about whether something more is needed to fight it than yet another recital of climate science facts.</p>
<p><b>AG</b>: Right, you hear a lot of people giving advice on how to talk about climate science—how you need to dress differently or stand on your head and deliver the message in rhyme. And I respect all that, and I hope a lot of people will present the message in their own way. But my message is about presenting the reality. I have faith in the United States and our ability to make good decisions based on the facts. And I believe Mother Nature is speaking very loudly and clearly. We’ve had ten disasters in the United States this year alone costing more than $1 billion and which were climate-related. It’s only a matter of time before reality sinks in, and we need both parties involved. And the only way to get the right answer is to understand the question.

				<div class="entry">
					<p>The US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is running out of money! </p>
<p>So far this year, ten weather disasters have each caused over a billion dollars of damage in the United States.  This beats the record set in 2008, when there were nine.  FEMA now has less than a billion dollars in its fund:</p>
<p>&bull; Brian Naylor, <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/08/30/140042914/costs-of-irene-add-up-as-fema-runs-out-of-cash">Costs Of Irene Add Up As FEMA Runs Out Of Cash</a>, <i>Morning Edition</i>, National Public Radio, 30 August 2011.</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/08/30/140042914/costs-of-irene-add-up-as-fema-runs-out-of-cash"><img width="400" src="https://i0.wp.com/media.npr.org/assets/img/2011/08/29/irene_road_custom.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>Let&#8217;s review these disasters:</p>
<p>10) Hurricane Irene, August 27-28: A large and powerful Atlantic hurricane that left extensive flood and wind damage along its path through the Caribbean, the east coast of the US and as far north as Atlantic Canada.  Early estimates say Irene caused <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Damage-from-Irene-appears-to-apf-1228197775.html"><b>$7 billion in damages</b></a> in the US.</p>
<p>9) Upper Midwest flooding, summer: An above-average snowpack across the northern Rocky Mountains, combined with rainstorms, caused the Missouri and Souris rivers to swell beyond their banks across the Upper Midwest. An estimated 11,000 people were forced to evacuate Minot, N.D. Numerous levees were breached along the Missouri River, flooding thousands of acres of farmland. <b>Over $2 billion in damages</b>.</p>
<p>8) Mississippi River flooding, spring-summer: Persistent rainfall (nearly triple the normal amount in the Ohio Valley), combined with melting snowpack, caused historical flooding along the Mississippi River and its tributaries. At least two people died. <b>$2 to $4 billion in damages</b>.</p>
<p>7) Southern Plains/Southwest drought, heat wave and wildfires, spring and summer: Drought, heat waves, and wildfires hit Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona, southern Kansas, western Arkansas and Louisiana this year. Wildfire fighting costs for the region are about $1 million per day, with over 2,000 homes and structures lost by mid-August. <b>Over $5 billion in damages so far</b>.</p>
<p>6) Midwest/Southeast tornadoes, May 22-27: Central and southern states saw approximately 180 twisters and 177 deaths within a week. A tornado in Joplin, Mo., caused at least 141 deaths&#8212;the deadliest single tornado to strike the United States since modern record keeping began in 1950. <b>Over $7 billion in damages</b>.</p>
<p>5) Southeast/Ohio Valley/Midwest tornadoes, April 25-30: This outbreak of tornadoes over central and southern states led to 327 deaths. Of those fatalities, 240 occurred in Alabama. The deadliest of the estimated 305 tornadoes in the outbreak was an EF-5 that hit northern Alabama, killing 78 people. Several big cities were directly affected by strong tornadoes, including Tuscaloosa, Birmingham and Huntsville in Alabama, and Chattanooga in Tennessee. <b>Over $9 billion in damages</b>.</p>
<p>4) Midwest/Southeast tornadoes, April 14-16: An outbreak over central and southern states produced an estimated 160 tornadoes. Thirty-eight people died, 22 of them in North Carolina. <b>Over $2 billion in damages</b>.</p>
<p>3) Southeast/Midwest tornadoes, April 8-11: An outbreak of tornadoes over central and southern states saw an estimated 59 tornadoes. <b>Over $2.2 billion in damages</b>.</p>
<p>2) Midwest/Southeast tornadoes, April 4-5: An outbreak of tornadoes over central and southern states saw an estimated 46 tornadoes. Nine people died. <b>Over $2.3 billion in damages</b>.</p>
<p>1) Blizzard, Jan 29-Feb 3: A large winter storm hit many central, eastern and northeastern states. 36 people died. <b>Over $2 billion in damages</b>.</p>
<p>I got most of this information from this article, which was written before Irene pushed 2011 into the lead:</p>
<p>&bull; Brett Israel, <a href="http://www.ouramazingplanet.com/billion-dollar-weather-disasters-1883/">2011 ties for most billion-dollar weather disasters</a>, <i>Our Amazing Planet</i>, 18 August 2011.</p>
<p>We can expect more weather disasters as global warming proceeds.  The <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/NRC+climate+stabilization+targets">National Academy of Sciences</a> says:</p>
<p>• Increases of precipitation at high latitudes and drying of the already semi-arid regions are projected with increasing global warming, with seasonal changes in several regions expected to be about 5-10% per degree of warming.  However, patterns of precipitation show much larger variability across models than patterns of temperature.</p>
<p>• Large increases in the area burned by wildfire are expected in parts of Australia, western Canada, Eurasia and the United States.</p>
<p>• Extreme precipitation events&#8212;that is, days with the top 15% of rainfall&#8212;are expected to increase by 3-10% per degree of warming.</p>
<p>• In many regions the amount of flow in streams and rivers is expected to change by 5-15% per degree of warming, with decreases in some areas and increases in others.</p>
<p>• The total number of tropical cyclones should decrease slightly or remain unchanged. Their wind speed is expected to increase by 1-4% per degree of warming.</p>
<p>Some people worry about sea level rise, but I think the bite from weather disasters and ensuing crop failures will hurt much more, much sooner.</p>
<p>Since it doesn&#8217;t look like politicians will do enough to cut carbon emissions, <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/the-god-clause-and-the-reinsurance-industry-09012011_page_5.html">insurance companies are moving to act on their own</a>&#8212;not to prevent weather disasters, but to minimize their effect:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Swiss Re’s global headquarters face Lake Zurich, overlooking a small yacht harbor. Bresch and a colleague, Andreas Schraft, sometimes walk the 20 minutes to the train station together after work, past more yachts, an arboretum, and a series of bridges. In September 2005, probably on one of these walks, the two began to discuss what they now call “Faktor K,” for “Kultur”: the culture factor. Losses from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma had been much higher than expected in ways the existing windstorm models hadn’t predicted, and it wasn’t because they were far off on wind velocities.</p>
<p>The problem had to do more with how people on the Gulf Coast were assessing windstorm risk as a group. Mangrove swamps on the Louisiana coast had been cut down and used as fertilizer, stripping away a barrier that could have sapped the storm of some of its energy. Levees were underbuilt, not overbuilt. Reinsurers and modeling firms had focused on technology and the natural sciences; they were missing lessons from economists and social scientists. “We can’t just add another bell and whistle to the model,” says Bresch, “It’s about how societies tolerate risk.”</p>
<p>“We approach a lot of things as much as we can from the point of statistics and hard data,” says David Smith, head of model development for Eqecat, a natural hazards modeling firm. “It’s not the perfect expression.” The discrepancy between the loss his firm modeled for Katrina and the ultimate claims-based loss number for his clients was the largest Smith had seen. Like others in the industry, Eqecat had failed to anticipate the extent of levee failure. Construction quality in the Gulf states before Katrina was poorer than anticipated, and Eqecat was surprised by a surge in demand after the storm that inflated prices for labor and materials to rebuild. Smith recognizes that these are questions for sociologists and economists as well as engineers, and he consults with the softer sciences to get his models right. But his own market has its demands, too. “The more we can base the model on empirical data,” he says, “the more defendable it is.”</p>
<p>After their walk around the lake in 2005, Swiss Re’s Bresch and Schraft began meeting with social scientists and laying out two goals. First, they wanted to better understand the culture factor and, ultimately, the risks they were underwriting. Second, they wanted to use that understanding to help the insured prevent losses before they had to be paid for.</p>
<p>The business of insurers and reinsurers rests on balancing a risk between two extremes. If the risk isn’t probable enough, or the potential loss isn’t expensive enough, there’s no reason for anyone to buy insurance for it. If it’s too probable and the loss too expensive, the premium will be unaffordable. This is bad for both the insured and the insurer. So the insurance industry has an interest in what it calls “loss mitigation.” It encourages potential customers to keep their property from being destroyed in the first place. If Swiss Re is trying to affect the behavior of the property owners it underwrites, it’s sending a signal: Some behavior is so risky that it’s hard to price. Keep it up, and you’ll have no insurance and we’ll have no business. That’s bad for everyone.</p>
<p>To that end, Swiss Re has started speaking about climate risk, not climate change. <b>That the climate is changing has been established in the eyes of the industry. “For a long time,” says Bresch, “people thought we only needed to do detailed modeling to truly understand in a specific region how the climate will change. … You can do that forever.” In many places, he says, climate change is only part of the story. The other part is economic development. In other words, we’re building in the wrong places in the wrong way, so wrong that what we build often isn’t even insurable.</b> In an interview published by Swiss Re, Wolf Dombrowsky, of the Disaster Research Center at Kiel University in Germany, points out that it’s wrong to say that a natural disaster destroyed something; the destruction was not nature’s fault but our own.</p>
<p>In 1888 the city of Sundsvall in Sweden, built of wood, burned to the ground. A group of reinsurers, Swiss Re among them, let Sweden’s insurers know there was going to be a limit in the future on losses from wooden houses, and it was going to be low. Sweden began building with stone. Reinsurance is a product, but also a carrot in the negotiation between culture and reality; it lets societies know what habits are unsustainable.</p>
<p><b>More recently, the company has been working with McKinsey &amp; Co., the European Commission, and several environmental groups to develop a methodology it calls the “economics of climate adaptation,” a way to encourage city planners to build in a way that will be insurable in the future</b>. A study of the U.K. port of Hull looks at potential losses by 2030 under several different climate scenarios. Even under the most extreme, losses were expected to grow by $17 million due to climate change and by $23 million due to economic growth. How Hull builds in the next two decades matters more to it than the levels of carbon dioxide in the air. A similar study for Entergy (ETR), a New Orleans-based utility, concluded that adaptations on the Gulf Coast—such as tightening building codes, restoring wetlands and barrier islands, building levees around chemical plants, and requiring that new homes in high-risk areas be elevated—could almost completely offset the predicted cost of 100-year storms happening every 40 years.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I actually disagree somewhat with the statement &#8220;it’s wrong to say that a natural disaster destroyed something; the destruction was not nature’s fault but our own.&#8221;  There&#8217;s some truth to this, but also some untruth.  The question of &#8220;fault&#8221; or &#8220;blame&#8221; is a slippery one here, and there&#8217;s probably no way to completely settle it.  </p>
<p>Is it the &#8220;fault&#8221; of people in Vermont that they weren&#8217;t fully prepared for a hurricane?  After all, it&#8217;s rare&#8212;or at least it <i>used</i> to be rare&#8212;for hurricanes to make it that far north.  The governor of Vermont, Peter Shumlin, <a href="http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/aug2011/2011-08-30-092.html">recently said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
I find it extraordinary that so many political leaders won&#8217;t actually talk about the relationship between climate change, fossil fuels, our continuing irrational exuberance about burning fossil fuels, in light of these storm patterns that we&#8217;ve been experiencing.</p>
<p>We had storms this spring that flooded our downtowns and put us through many of the same exercises that we&#8217;re going through right now. We didn&#8217;t used to get weather patterns like this in Vermont. We didn&#8217;t get tropical storms. We didn&#8217;t get flash flooding.</p>
<p>We in the colder states are going to see the results of climate change first.  Myself, Premier Charest up in Quebec, Governor Cuomo over in New York, we understand that the flooding and the extraordinary weather patterns that we&#8217;re seeing are a result of our burnings of fossil fuel. We&#8217;ve got to get off fossil fuels as quickly as we know how, to make this planet livable for our children and our grandchildren.
</p></blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, you could say that it <i>is</i> the fault of Vermonters, or at least humanity as a whole, for causing global warming in the first place. </p>
<p>But ultimately, pinning blame on someone or something is less important than figuring out how to solve the problems we face.</p>

					<p>Some people worry about rising sea levels due to global warming.  But that will happen slowly.  I worry about tipping points.</p>
<p>The word &#8220;tipping point&#8221; should remind you of pushing on a glass of water.  If you push it a little, and then stop, it&#8217;ll right itself: no harm done.  But if you push it past a certain point, it starts tipping over.  Then it&#8217;s hard to stop.</p>
<p>So, we need to study possible tipping points in the Earth&#8217;s climate system.  Here&#8217;s a list of them:</p>

<p>Today I want to talk about one: melting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permafrost">permafrost</a>.  When melting permafrost in the Arctic starts releasing lots of carbon dioxide and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_methane">methane</a>&#8212;a vastly more potent greenhouse gas&#8212;the Earth will get even hotter.  That, in turn, will melt even more permafrost.  In theory, this feedback loop could tip the Earth over to a much hotter state.  But how much should we worry about this?</p>
<p>Climate activist <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Joseph+Romm">Joe Romm</a> takes it very seriously:</p>
<p>&bull; Joe Romm, <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/romm/2011/02/17/207552/nsidc-thawing-permafrost-will-turn-from-carbon-sink-to-source-in-mid-2020s-releasing-100-billion-tons-of-carbon-by-2100/">NSIDC bombshell: Thawing permafrost feedback will turn Arctic from carbon sink to source in the 2020s, releasing 100 billion tons of carbon by 2100</a>, <i>Climate Progress</i>, 17 February 2011.</p>
<p>If you click on just one link of mine today, let it be this!  He writes in a clear, snappy way.  But let me take you through some of the details in my own more pedestrian fashion.</p>
<p>For starters, the Arctic is melting.  Here&#8217;s a graph of Arctic sea ice volume created by the <a href="http://psc.apl.washington.edu/wordpress/research/projects/arctic-sea-ice-volume-anomaly/">Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System</a>&mdash;click to enlarge:</p>

<p>The blue line is the linear best fit, but you can see it&#8217;s been melting faster lately.  Is this a glitch or a new trend?  Time will tell.  </p>
<p>2011 is considerably worse than 2007, the previous record-holder.  Here you can clearly see the estimated total volume in thousands of cubic kilometers, and how it changes with the seasons:</p>

</a></div>
<p>As the Arctic melts, many things are changing.  The fabled Northwest Passage is becoming a practical waterway, so battles are starting to heat up over who controls it. The U.S. and other nations see it as an international waterway. But Canada <i>says</i> they own it, and have the right to regulate and protect it:</p>

<p>But the 800-pound gorilla in the room is the melting permafrost.   A lot of the Arctic is covered by permafrost, and it stores a lot of carbon, both as peat and as methane.  After all, peat is rotten plant material, and rotting plants make methane.   Recent work estimates that between 1400 and 1700 gigatonnes of carbon is stored in permafrost soils worldwide:</p>
<p>&bull; C. Tarnocai, J. G. Canadell, E. A. G. Schuur, P. Kuhry, G. Mazhitova, and S. Zimov, <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/search;jsessionid=54ECC51F1C0E23292094E566C265B629?q=Soil+organic+carbon+pools+in+the+northern+circumpolar+permafrost+region%2C&amp;submit=Search&amp;sort=rel">Soil organic carbon pools in the northern circumpolar permafrost region</a>, <i><a href="http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2009/2008GB003327.shtml">Global Biogeochemical Cycles</a></i> <b>23</b> (2009), GB2023.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s more carbon than currently resides in all living things, and twice as much carbon as held by the atmosphere!</p>
<p>How much of this carbon will be released as the Arctic melts&#8212;and how fast?  There&#8217;s a new paper about that:</p>
<p>&bull; Kevin Schaefer, Tingjun Zhang, Lori Bruhwiler, Andrew Barrett, Amount and timing of permafrost carbon release in response to climate warming, <i><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0889.2011.00527.x/full">Tellus B</a></i> <b>63</b> (2011), 165–180.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not free, but you can read <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/romm/2011/02/17/207552/nsidc-thawing-permafrost-will-turn-from-carbon-sink-to-source-in-mid-2020s-releasing-100-billion-tons-of-carbon-by-2100/">Joe Romm&#8217;s summary</a>.  Here&#8217;s their estimate on how carbon will be released by melting permafrost:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://thinkprogress.org/romm/2011/02/17/207552/nsidc-thawing-permafrost-will-turn-from-carbon-sink-to-source-in-mid-2020s-releasing-100-billion-tons-of-carbon-by-2100/"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature/permafrost_carbon_flux_Schaefer_et_al.gif" /></a></div>
<p>So, they&#8217;re guessing that melting permafrost will release a gigatonne of carbon per year by the mid-2030s.  Moreover, they say:</p>
<blockquote><p>
We predict that the PCF [permafrost carbon feedback] will change the Arctic from a carbon sink to a source after the mid-2020s and is strong enough to cancel 42-88% of the total global land sink. The thaw and decay of permafrost carbon is irreversible and accounting for the PCF will require larger reductions in fossil fuel emissions to reach a target atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration.
</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the authors explains more details <a href="http://nsidc.org/news/press/20110216_permafrost.html">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;The amount of carbon released [by 2200] is equivalent to half the amount of carbon that has been released into the atmosphere since the dawn of the industrial age,” said NSIDC scientist Kevin Schaefer.  &#8220;That is a lot of carbon.&#8221;</p>
<p>The carbon from permanently frozen ground known as permafrost &#8220;will make its impact, not only on the climate, but also on international strategies to reduce climate change Schaefer said.  &#8220;If we want to hit a target carbon concentration, then we have to reduce fossil fuel emissions that much lower than previously calculated to account for this additional carbon from the permafrost,&#8221; Schaefer said. &#8220;Otherwise we will end up with a warmer Earth than we want.&#8221;</p>
<p>The carbon comes from plant material frozen in soil during the ice age of the Pleistocene: the icy soil trapped and preserved the biomass for thousands of years.  Schaefer equates the mechanism to storing broccoli in the home freezer: &#8220;As long as it stays frozen, it stays stable for many years,&#8221; he said. “But you take it out of the freezer and it will thaw out and decay.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, permafrost is thawing in a warming climate and &#8220;just like the broccoli&#8221; the biomass will thaw and decay, releasing carbon into the atmosphere like any other decomposing plant material, Schaefer said.  To predict how much carbon will enter the atmosphere and when, Schaefer and coauthors modeled the thaw and decay of organic matter currently frozen in permafrost under potential future warming conditions as predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.</p>
<p>They found that between 29-59 percent of the permafrost will disappear by 2200. That permafrost took tens of thousands of years to form, but will melt in less than 200, Schaefer said.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Sound alarmist?  In fact, there are three unrealistically conservative assumptions built into this paper:</p>
<p>1) The authors assume the &#8216;moderate warming&#8217; scenario called A1B, which has atmospheric concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> reaching 520 ppm by 2050 and stabilizing at 700 ppm in 2100.   But so far we seem to be living out the <a href="http://www.ipcc-data.org/sres/ddc_sres_emissions.html">A1F1 scenario</a>, which reaches 1000 ppm by century’s end.</p>
<p>2) Their estimate of future temperatures neglects the effect of greenhouse gases released by melting permafrost.</p>
<p>3) They assume all carbon emitted by permafrost will be in the form of CO<sub>2</sub>, not methane.</p>
<p>Point 2) means that <i>the whole question of a feedback loop is not explored in this paper</i>.  I understand why.  To do that, you can&#8217;t use someone else&#8217;s climate model: you need to build your own!  But it&#8217;s something we need to study.  Do you know anyone who is?  Joe Romm says:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Countless studies make clear that global warming will release vast quantities of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere this decade.  Yet, <b>no climate model currently incorporates the amplifying feedback from methane released by a defrosting tundra.</b>
</p></blockquote>
<p>If we try to understand this feedback, point 3) becomes important.  After all, while methane goes away faster than CO<sub>2</sub>, its greenhouse effect is much stronger while it lasts.   For the first 20 years, methane has about 72 times the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global-warming_potential">global warming potential</a> of carbon dioxide.  Over the first 100 years, it&#8217;s about 25 times as powerful.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s think about that a minute.  In 2008, we burnt about 8 gigatonnes of carbon.  If Schaefer <i>et al</i> are right, we can expect 1 extra gigatonne of carbon to be released from Arctic permafrost by around 2035.  If that&#8217;s almost all in the form of carbon dioxide, it makes our situation slightly worse.  But if a lot of it is methane, which is&#8212;let&#8217;s roughly say&#8212;72 times as bad&#8212;then our situation will be <i>dramatically</i> worse.  </p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t know how much of the carbon released will be in the form of methane.  I also don&#8217;t know how much of the methane will turn into other organic compounds before it gets into the atmosphere.  I&#8217;d really like to know!</p>

					<h3>Or: A very short introduction to turbulence</h3>

<p>Isn&#8217;t it strange that clouds in the sky would show the same pattern as some gases in a small laboratory experiment? The reason for this is not quite understood today. In this post, I would like to talk a little bit about what is known. </p>
<h4>Matter that tries to get out of its own way</h4>
<p>Fluids like water and air can be well described by Newton&#8217;s laws of classical mechanics. When you start learning about classical mechanics, you consider discrete masses, most of the time.  Billiard balls, for example. But it is possible to formulate Newton&#8217;s laws of motion for fluids by treating them as &#8216;infinitely many infinitesimally small&#8217; billiard balls, all pushing and rubbing against each other and therefore trying to get out of the way of each other.</p>
<p>If we do this, we get some equations describing fluid flow: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier-Stokes">Navier-Stokes equations</a>.  </p>
<p>The Navier-Stokes equations are a complicated set of nonlinear partial differential equations. A lot of mathematical questions about them are still unanswered, like: under what conditions is there a smooth solution to these equations? If you can answer that question, you will win one of the <a href="http://www.claymath.org/millennium/Navier-Stokes_Equations">a million dollars</a> from the Clay Mathematics Institute.</p>
<p>If you completed the standard curriculum of physics as I did, chances are that you never attended a class on fluid dynamics. At least I never did. When you take a first look at the field, you will notice: the literature about the Navier-Stokes equations alone is <i>huge!</i> Not to mention all the special aspects of numerical simulations, special aspects of the climate and so on. </p>
<p>So it is nice to find a pedagogical introduction to the subject for people who have some background knowledge in partial differential equations, for the mathematical theory:</p>
<p>&bull; C. Foias, R. Rosa, O. Manley and R. Temam, <i>Navier-Stokes Equations and Turbulence</i>, Cambridge U. Press, Cambridge, 2001.  </p>
<p>So, there is a lot of fun to be had for the mathematically inclined. But today I would like to talk about an aspect of fluid flows that also has a tremendous <i>practical</i> importance, especially for the climate of the Earth: <i>turbulence!</i></p>
<p>There is no precise definition of turbulence, but people know it when they see it. A fluid can flow in layers, with one layer above the other, maybe slightly slower or faster. Material of one layer does hardly mix with material of another layer. These flows are called <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminar_flow">laminar flows</a></b>. When a laminar flow gets faster and faster, it turns into a turbulent flow at some point:</p>
<div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/files/laminar_to_turbulent_flow.png" alt="" />
</div>
<p>This is a fluid flow inside a circular pipe, with a layer of some darker fluid in the middle.</p>
<p>As a first guess we could say that a characteristic property of turbulent flow is the presence of circular flows, commonly called <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_%28fluid_dynamics%29">eddies</a></b>.</p>
<h4>Tempests in Teapots</h4>
<p>A funny aspect of the Navier-Stokes equations is that they don&#8217;t come with any recommended length scale. Properties of the fluid flow like velocity and pressure are modelled as smooth functions of continuous time and space. Of course we know that this model does not work on a atomic length scale, where we have to consider individual atoms. Pressure and velocity of a fluid flow don&#8217;t make any sense on a length scale that is smaller than the average distance between electrons and the atom nucleus. </p>
<p>We know this, but this is a fact that is not present in the model comprised by the Navier-Stokes equations! </p>
<p>But let us look at bigger length scales.  An interesting feature of the solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations is that there are fluid flows that stretch over hundreds of meters that look like fluid flows that stretch over centimeters only. And it is really astonishing that this phenomenon can be observed in nature. This is another example of the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematical models.</p>
<p>You have seen an example of this in the introduction already. That was a boundary layer instability. Here is a full blown turbulent example: </p>
<div align="center">
<img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/files/turbulence_at_different_length_scales.png" alt="" />
</div>
<p>The last two pictures are from the book:</p>
<p>&bull; Arkady Tsinober: <i>An Informal Conceptual Introduction to Turbulence</i>, 2nd edition, Springer, Fluid Mechanics and Its Applications Volume 92, Berlin, 2009. </p>
<p>This is a nice introduction to the subject, especially if you are more interested in phenomenology than mathematical details.</p>
<p>Maybe you noticed the &#8220;Reynolds number&#8221; in the label text of the last picture. What is that?</p>
<p>People in business administration like management ratios; they throw all the confusing information they have about a company into a big mixer and extract one or two numbers that tell them where they stand, like business volume and earnings. People in hydrodynamics are somewhat similar; they define all kinds of &#8220;numbers&#8221; that condense a lot of information about fluid flows. </p>
<p>A CEO would want to know if the earnings of his company are positive or negative. We would like to know a number that tells us if a fluid flow is laminar or turbulent. Luckily, such a number already exists. It is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynolds_number"><b>Reynolds number</b></a>! A low number indicates a laminar flow, a high number a turbulent flow. Like the calculation of the revenue of a company, the calculation of the Reynolds number of a given fluid flow is not an exact science. Instead there is some measure of estimation necessary. The definition involves, for example, a &#8220;characteristic length scale&#8221;. This is a fuzzy concept that usually involves some object that interacts with &#8211; in our case &#8211; the fluid flow. The characteristic length scale in this case is the physical dimension of the object. While there is usually no objectively correct way to assing a &#8220;characteristic length&#8221; to a three dimensional object, this concept allows us nevertheless to distinguish the scattering of water waves on a ocean liner (length scale &asymp; 10<sup></sup><sup>3</sup> meter) from their scattering on a peanut (length scale &asymp; 10<sup></sup><sup>-2</sup> meter).</p>
<p>The following graphic shows laminar and turbulent flows and their characteristic Reynolds numbers:</p>
<div align="center">

<p>This graphic is from the book</p>
<p>&bull; Thomas Bohr, Mogens H. Jensen, Giovanni Paladin and Angelo Vulpiani, <i>Dynamical Systems Approach to Turbulence</i>, Cambridge U. Press, Cambridge, 1998 </p>
<p>But let us leave the Reynolds number for now and turn to one of its ingredients: <i>viscosity</i>. Understanding viscosity is important for understanding how eddies in a fluid flow are connected to energy dissipation.</p>
<h4>Eddies dissipate kinetic energy</h4>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;Eddies,&#8221; said Ford, &#8220;in the space-time continuum.&#8221;</p>
<p>
&#8220;Ah,&#8221; nodded Arthur, &#8220;is he? Is he?&#8221; He pushed his hands into the pocket of his dressing gown and looked knowledgeably into the distance.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;What?&#8221; said Ford.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Er, who,&#8221; said Arthur, &#8220;is Eddy, then, exactly, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8211; from Douglas Adams: <i>Life, the Universe and Everything</i>
</p></blockquote>
<p>A fluid flow can be pictured as consisting of a lot of small fluid packages that move alongside each other. In many situations, there will be some friction between these packages. In the case of fluids, this friction is called <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscosity">viscosity</a></b>. </p>
<p>It is an empirical fact that at small velocities fluid flows are laminar: there are layers upon layers, with one layer moving at a constant speed, and almost no mixing. At the boundaries, the fluid will attach to the surrounding material, and the relative fluid flow will be zero. If you picture such a flow between a plate that is at rest, and a plate that is moving forward, you will see that due to friction between the layers a force needs to be exerted to keep the moving plate moving:</p>

<p>In the simplest approximation, you will have to exert some force <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F" class="latex" /> per unit area <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" />, in order to sustain a linear increase of the velocity of the upper plate along the y-axis, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpartial+u+%2F+%5Cpartial+y.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;partial u / &#92;partial y." class="latex" /> The constant of proportionality is called the viscosity <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mu" class="latex" />:</p>

<p>More friction means a bigger viscosity: honey has a bigger viscosity than water.</p>
<p>If you stir honey, the fluid flow will come to a halt rather fast. The energy that you put in to start the fluid flow is turned to heat by dissipation. This mechanism is of course related to friction and therefore to viscosity.</p>
<p>It is possible to formulate an exact formula for this dissipation process using the Navier-Stokes equations. It is not hard to prove it, but I will only explain the involved gadgets.</p>
<p>A fluid flow in three dimensions can be described by stating the velocity of the fluid flow at a certain time <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="t" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cvec%7Bx%7D+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;vec{x} &#92;in &#92;mathbb{R}^3" class="latex" /> (I&#8217;m not specifying the region of the fluid flow or any boundary or initial conditions). Let&#8217;s call the velocity <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cvec%7Bu%7D%28t%2C+%5Cvec%7Bx%7D%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;vec{u}(t, &#92;vec{x})" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s assume that the fluid has a constant density <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;rho" class="latex" />. Such a fluid is called <b>incompressible</b>. For convenience let us assume that the density is 1: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho+%3D+1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;rho = 1" class="latex" />. Then the <b>kinetic energy</b> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E%28%5Cvec%7Bu%7D%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="E(&#92;vec{u})" class="latex" /> of a fluid flow at a fixed time <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="t" class="latex" /> is given by</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+E%28%5Cvec%7Bu%7D%29+%3D+%5Cint+%5C%7C+%5Cvec%7Bu%7D%28t%2C+%5Cvec%7Bx%7D%29+%5C%7C%5E2+%5C%3B+d%5E3+x+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ E(&#92;vec{u}) = &#92;int &#92;| &#92;vec{u}(t, &#92;vec{x}) &#92;|^2 &#92;; d^3 x }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s just assume that this integral is finite for the moment. This is the first gadget we need.</p>
<p>The second gadget is called <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enstrophy">enstrophy</a></b> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;epsilon" class="latex" /> of the fluid flow. This is a measure of how much eddies there are. It is the integral</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B%5Cepsilon+%3D+%5Cint+%5C%7C+%5Cnabla+%5Ctimes+%5Cvec%7Bu%7D+%5C%7C%5E2+%5C%3B+d%5E3+x+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{&#92;epsilon = &#92;int &#92;| &#92;nabla &#92;times &#92;vec{u} &#92;|^2 &#92;; d^3 x }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla+%5Ctimes&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;nabla &#92;times" class="latex" /> denotes the <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curl_%28mathematics%29">curl</a></b> of the fluid velocity. The faster the fluid rotates, the bigger the curl is. </p>
<p>(The math geeks will notice that the vector fields <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cvec%7Bu%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;vec{u}" class="latex" /> that have a finite kinetic energy and a finite enstrophy are precisely the elements of the Sobolev space <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H%5E1%28%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E3%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="H^1(&#92;mathbb{R}^3)" class="latex" />)</p>
<p>Here is the relationship of the decay of the kinetic energy and the enstrophy, which is a consequence of the Navier-Stokes equations (and suitable boundary conditions):</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B%5Cfrac%7Bd%7D%7Bd+t%7D+E+%3D+-+%5Cmu+%5Cepsilon%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{&#92;frac{d}{d t} E = - &#92;mu &#92;epsilon} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>This equation says that the energy decays with time, and it decays faster if there is a higher viscosity, and if there are more and stronger eddies.</p>
<p>If you are interested in the mathematically precise derivation of this equation, you can look it up in the book I already mentioned:</p>
<p>&bull; C. Foias, R. Rosa, O. Manley and R. Temam, <i>Navier-Stokes Equations and Turbulence</i>, Cambridge U. Press, Cambridge, 2001.  </p>
<p>This connection of eddies and dissipation could indicate that there is also a connection of eddies and some maximum entropy principle. Since eddies maximize dissipation, natural fluid flows should somehow tend towards the production of eddies. It would be interesting to know more about this!</p>
<p>In this post we have seen eddies at different length scales. There are buzzwords in meteorology for this:</p>

</div>
<p>You have seen eddies at the &#8216;microscale&#8217; (left) and at the &#8216;mesoscale&#8217; (middle).  A blog post about eddies should of course mention the most famous eddy of the last decade, which formed at the &#8216;synoptic scale&#8217;:</p>

</div>
<p>Do you recognize it? That was Hurricane Katrina.</p>
<p>It is obviously important to understand disasters like this one on the synoptic scale. This is an active topic of ongoing research, both in meteorology and in climate science.</p>

				<small>21 August, 2011</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>The Earth&#8217;s climate is complicated.  How well do we understand how it will react to the drastic increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide that we&#8217;re imposing on it?  One reason it&#8217;s hard to be 100% sure is that the truly dramatic changes most scientists expect lie mostly in the <i>future</i>.  There&#8217;s a lot of important evidence we&#8217;ll get only when it&#8217;s too late. </p>
<p>Luckily, the Earth&#8217;s <i>past</i> also shows signs of dramatic climate change: for example, the glacial cycles I began discussing last time in <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/07/22/this-weeks-finds-week-317/">&quot;week317&quot;</a>.  These cycles make an interesting test of how well we understand climate change.  Of course, their mechanism is very different from that of human-caused global warming, so we might understand one but not the other.  Indeed, earlier episodes like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleocene-Eocene_Thermal_Maximum">Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum</a> might shed more light on what we&#8217;re doing to the Earth now!  But still, the glacial cycles are an impressive instance of dramatic climate change, which we&#8217;d do well to understand.  </p>
<p>As I hinted last week, a lot of scientists believe that the Earth&#8217;s glacial cycles are related to cyclic changes in the Earth&#8217;s orbit and the tilt of its axis.  Since one of the first scientists to carefully study this issue was Milutin Milankovitch, these are called <b>Milankovitch cycles</b>.  The three major types of Milankovitch cycle are:</p>
<p>&bull; changes in the <b>eccentricity</b> of the Earth&#8217;s orbit &#8211; that is, how much the orbit deviates from being a circle:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_eccentricity"><br />
<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Eccentricity_zero.svg/200px-Eccentricity_zero.svg.png" /><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Eccentricity_half.svg/171px-Eccentricity_half.svg.png" /><br />
</a> <br />
(changes greatly exaggerated)
</div>
<p>&bull; changes in the <b>obliquity</b>, or tilt of the Earth&#8217;s axis:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt"><br />
<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Earth_obliquity_range.svg/250px-Earth_obliquity_range.svg.png" /><br />
</a>
</div>
<p>&bull; <b>precession</b>, meaning changes in the direction of the Earth&#8217;s axis relative to the fixed stars:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_precession_%28astronomy%29"><br />
<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Earth_precession.svg/250px-Earth_precession.svg.png" /><br />
</a>
</div>
<p>Now, the first important thing to realize is this: it&#8217;s not obvious that Milankovitch cycles can cause glacial cycles.  During a glacial period, the Earth is about 5&deg;C cooler than it is now.  But the Milankovitch cycles barely affect the overall annual amount of solar radiation hitting the Earth!</p>
<p>This fact is clear for precession or changes in obliquity, since these just involve the tilt of the Earth&#8217;s axis, and the Earth is nearly a sphere.  The amount of Sun hitting a sphere doesn&#8217;t depend on how the sphere is &#8217;tilted&#8217;.</p>
<p>For changes in the eccentricity of the Earth&#8217;s orbit, this fact is a bit less obvious.  After all, when the orbit is more eccentric, the Earth gets <i>closer</i> to the Sun sometimes, but <i>farther</i> at other times.   So you need to actually sit down and do some math to figure out the net effect.  Luckily, Greg Egan did this for us&#8212;I&#8217;ll show you his calculation at the end of this article.  It turns out that when the Earth&#8217;s orbit is at its most eccentric, it gets <i>very, very slightly</i> more energy from the Sun each year: 0.167% more than when its orbit is at its least eccentric.  </p>
<p>So, there are interesting puzzles involved in the Milankovitch cycles.  They don&#8217;t affect the total amount of radiation that hits the Earth each year&#8212;not much, anyway&#8212;but they <i>do</i> cause substantial changes in the amount of radiation that hits the Earth at various different <i>latitudes</i> in various different <i>seasons</i>.  We need to understand what such changes might do.</p>
<p>James Croll was one of the first to think about this, back around 1875.  He decided that what really matters is the amount of sunlight hitting the far northern latitudes in <i>winter</i>.  When this was low, he claimed, glaciers would tend to form and an ice age would start.  But later, in the 1920s, Milankovitch made the opposite claim: what really matters is the amount of sunlight hitting the far northern latitudes in <i>summer</i>.  When <i>this</i> was low, an ice age would start.  </p>
<p>If we take a quick look at the data, we see that the truth is not obvious:</p>

</div>
<p>I like this graph because it&#8217;s pretty&#8230;  but I wish the vertical axes were labelled.  We will see some more precise graphs in future weeks.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, this graph gives some idea of what&#8217;s going on.  Precession, obliquity and eccentricity vary in complex but still predictable ways.  From this you can compute the amount of solar energy that hits the surface of the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere on July 1st at a latitude of 65&deg; N.   That&#8217;s the yellow curve.    People believe this quantity has <i>some</i> relation to the Earth&#8217;s temperature, as shown by the black curve at bottom.  However, the relation is <i>far from clear!</i>   </p>
<p>Indeed, if you only look at this graph, you might easily decide that Milankovitch cycles are <i>not</i> important in causing glacial cycles.   But people have analyzed temperature proxies over long spans of time, and found evidence for cyclic changes at periods that match those of the Milankovitch cycles.   Here&#8217;s a classic paper on this subject:</p>
<p>&bull; J. D. Hays, J. Imbrie, and N. J. Shackleton, <a href="http://www.mantleplumes.org/WebDocuments/Hays1976.pdf">Variations in the earth&#8217;s orbit: pacemaker of the Ice Ages</a>, <i>Science</i> <b>194</b> (1976), 1121-1132.</p>
<p>They selected two sediment cores from the Indian ocean, which contain sediments deposited over the last 450,000 years.  They measured:</p>
<p>1) Ts, an estimate of summer sea-surface temperatures at the core site, derived from a statistical analysis of tiny organisms called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiolarian">radiolarians</a> found in the sediments.</p>
<p>2) &delta;<sup>18</sup>O, the excess of the heavy isotope of oxygen in tiny organisms called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foraminifera">foraminifera</a> also found in the sediments.</p>
<p>3) The percentage of radiolarians that are <i>Cycladophora davisiana</i>&#8212;a certain species not used in the estimation of Ts. </p>
<p>Identical samples were analyzed for the three variables at 10-centimeter intervals throughout each core.  Then they took a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform">Fourier transform</a> of this data to see at which frequencies these variables wiggle the most!  When we take the Fourier transform of a function and then square it, the result is called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_density">power spectrum</a>.  So, they actually graphed the power spectra for these three variables:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature/hays_imbrie_shackleton_spectra.jpg"><img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature/hays_imbrie_shackleton_spectra.jpg" alt="" /></a></div>
<p>The top graph shows the power spectra for Ts, &delta;<sup>18</sup>O, and the percentage of <i>Cycladophora davisiana</i>.  The second one shows the spectra after a bit of extra messing around.  Either way, there seem to be peaks at frequencies of 19, 23, 42 and <i>roughly</i> 100 thousand years.   However the last number is quite fuzzy: if you look, you&#8217;ll see the three different power spectra have peaks at 94, 106 and 122 thousand years.</p>
<p>So, some sort of cycles seem to be occurring.  This is far from the only piece of evidence, but it&#8217;s a famous one.  </p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s go over the three major forms of Milankovitch cycle, and keep our eye out for cycles that take place every 19, 23, 42 or roughly 100 thousand years!</p>
<h4>Eccentricity</h4>
<p>The Earth&#8217;s orbit is an ellipse, and the <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_eccentricity">eccentricity</a></b> of this ellipse says how far it is from being circular.  But the eccentricity of the Earth&#8217;s orbit slowly changes: it varies from being nearly circular, with an eccentricity of 0.005, to being more strongly elliptical, with an eccentricity of 0.058.  The mean eccentricity is 0.028.  There are several periodic components to these variations.  The strongest occurs with a period of 413,000 years, and changes the eccentricity by ±0.012.  Two other components have periods of 95,000 and 123,000 years.   </p>
<p>The eccentricity affects the percentage difference in incoming solar radiation between the <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perihelion">perihelion</a></b>, the point where the Earth is closest to the Sun, and the <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphelion">aphelion</a></b>, when it is farthest from the Sun.  This works as follows.  The percentage difference between the Earth&#8217;s distance from the Sun at perihelion and aphelion is twice the eccentricity, and the percentage change in incoming solar radiation is about twice that.  The first fact follows from the definition of eccentricity, while the second follows from differentiating the inverse-square relationship between brightness and distance.</p>
<p>Right now the eccentricity is 0.0167, or 1.67%.  Thus, the distance from the Earth to Sun varies 3.34% over the course of a year.  This in turn gives an annual variation in incoming solar radiation of about 6.68%.  Note that this is <i>not</i> the cause of the seasons: those arise due to the Earth&#8217;s tilt, and occur at different times in the northern and southern hemispheres.</p>
<h4>Obliquity</h4>
<p>The angle of the Earth&#8217;s axial tilt with respect to the plane of its orbit, called the <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt">obliquity</a></b>, varies between 22.1° and 24.5° in a roughly periodic way, with a period of 41,000 years.  When the obliquity is high, the strength of seasonal variations is stronger.  </p>
<p>Right now the obliquity is 23.44°, roughly halfway between its extreme values.  It is decreasing, and will reach its minimum value around the year 10,000 CE.</p>
<h4> Precession</h4>
<p>The slow turning in the direction of the Earth&#8217;s axis of rotation relative to the fixed stars, called <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_precession_%28astronomy%29">precession</a></b>, has a period of roughly 23,000 years.   As precession occurs, the seasons drift in and out of phase with the perihelion and aphelion of the Earth&#8217;s orbit.   </p>
<p>Right now the perihelion occurs during the southern hemisphere&#8217;s summer, while the aphelion is reached during the southern winter.  This tends to make the southern hemisphere seasons more extreme than the northern hemisphere seasons.</p>
<p>The gradual precession of the Earth is <i>not</i> due to the same physical mechanism as the wobbling of the top.  That sort of wobbling <i>does</i> occur, but it has a period of only 427 days.  The 23,000-year precession is due to tidal interactions between the Earth, Sun and Moon.  For details, see:</p>
<p>&bull; John Baez, <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/wobble/">The wobbling of the Earth and other curiosities</a>.</p>
<p>In the real world, most things get more complicated the more carefully you look at them.  For example, precession actually has several periodic components.  According to <a href="http://www2.academieroyale.be/academie/documents/BergerCV2008746.pdf">Andr&eacute; Berger</a>, a top expert on changes in the Earth&#8217;s orbit, the four biggest components have these periods:</p>
<p>&bull; 23,700 years </p>
<p>&bull; 22,400 years </p>
<p>&bull; 18,980 years</p>
<p>&bull; 19,160 years</p>
<p>in order of decreasing strength.  But in geology, these tend to show up either as a single peak around the mean value of 21,000 years, or two peaks at frequencies of 23,000 and 19,000 years.</p>
<p>To add to the fun, the three effects I&#8217;ve listed&mdash;changes in eccentricity, changes in obliquity, and precession&mdash;are not independent.  According to Berger, cycles in eccentricity arise from &#8216;beats&#8217; between different precession cycles:</p>
<p>&bull; The 95,000-year eccentricity cycle arises from a beat between the 23,700-year and 19,000-year precession cycles.</p>
<p>&bull; The 123,000-year eccentricity cycle arises from a beat between the 22,4000-year and 18,000-year precession cycles.</p>
<p>We should delve into all this stuff more deeply someday.  For now, let me just refer you to this classic review paper:</p>
<p>&bull; Andr&eacute; Berger, Pleistocene climatic variability at astronomical frequencies, <i><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/1040618289900165">Quaternary International</a></i> <b>2</b> (1989), 1-14.</p>
<p>Later, as I get up to speed, I&#8217;ll talk about more modern work.</p>
<h4> Paleontology versus astronomy </h4>
<p>So now we can compare the data from ocean sediments to the Milankovitch cycles as computed in astronomy:</p>
<p>&bull; The roughly 19,000-year cycle in ocean sediments may come from 18,980-year and 19,160-year <i>precession</i> cycles.</p>
<p>&bull; The roughly 23,000-year cycle in ocean sediments may come from 23,700-year <i>precession</i> cycle.</p>
<p>&bull; The roughly 42,000-year cycle in ocean sediments may come from the 41,000-year <i>obliquity</i> cycle.</p>
<p>&bull; The roughly 100,000-year cycle in ocean sediments may come from the 95,000-year and 123,000-year <i>eccentricity</i> cycles. </p>
<p>Again, the last one looks the most fuzzy.  As we saw, different kinds of sediments seem to indicate cycles of 94, 106 and 122 thousand years.  At least two of these periods match eccentricity cycles fairly well.  But a detailed analysis would be required to distinguish between real effects and coincidences in this subject!</p>
<h4> The effect of eccentricity </h4>
<p>I bet some of you are hungry for some actual math.  As I mentioned, it takes some work to see how changes in the eccentricity of the Earth&#8217;s orbit affect the annual average of sunlight hitting the top of the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere.    Luckily <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/07/02/a-quantum-of-warmth/#comment-6569">Greg Egan</a> has done this work for us.  While the result is surely not new, his approach makes nice use of the fact that both gravity and solar radiation obey an inverse-square law.  That&#8217;s pretty cool.</p>
<p>Here is his calculation:</p>
<p>The angular velocity of a planet is</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B%5Cfrac%7Bd+%5Ctheta%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7BJ%7D%7Bm+r%5E2%7D+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{&#92;frac{d &#92;theta}{d t} = &#92;frac{J}{m r^2} } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=J&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="J" class="latex" /> is the constant orbital angular momentum of the planet and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="m" class="latex" /> is its mass.  Thus the radiant energy delivered per unit time to the planet is </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7Bd+U%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7BC%7D%7Br%5E2%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{d U}{d t} = &#92;frac{C}{r^2}}" class="latex" /> </p>
<p>for some constant <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C" class="latex" />.  It follows that the energy delivered per unit of angular progress around the orbit is </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7Bd+U%7D%7Bd+%5Ctheta%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7BC%7D%7Br%5E2%7D+%5Cfrac%7Bd+t%7D%7Bd+%5Ctheta%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7BC+m%7D%7BJ%7D+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{d U}{d &#92;theta} = &#92;frac{C}{r^2} &#92;frac{d t}{d &#92;theta} = &#92;frac{C m}{J} } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>So, the total energy delivered in one period will be </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+U%3D%5Cfrac%7B2%5Cpi+C+m%7D%7BJ%7D+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ U=&#92;frac{2&#92;pi C m}{J} } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>How can we relate the orbital angular momentum <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=J&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="J" class="latex" /> to the shape of the orbit?  If you equate the total energy of the planet, kinetic <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7Dm+v%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;frac{1}{2}m v^2" class="latex" /> plus potential <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=-%5Cfrac%7BG+M+m%7D%7Br%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="-&#92;frac{G M m}{r}" class="latex" />, at its aphelion <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r_1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r_1" class="latex" /> and perihelion <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r_2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r_2" class="latex" />, and use <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=J&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="J" class="latex" /> to get the velocity in the kinetic energy term from its distance, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v%3D%5Cfrac%7BJ%7D%7Bm+r%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="v=&#92;frac{J}{m r}" class="latex" />, when we solve for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=J&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="J" class="latex" /> we get:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7BJ+%3D+m+%5Csqrt%7B%5Cfrac%7B2+G+M+r_1+r_2%7D%7Br_1%2Br_2%7D%7D+%3D+m+b+%5Csqrt%7B%5Cfrac%7BG+M%7D%7Ba%7D%7D%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{J = m &#92;sqrt{&#92;frac{2 G M r_1 r_2}{r_1+r_2}} = m b &#92;sqrt{&#92;frac{G M}{a}}} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>where </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+a%3D%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D+%28r_1%2Br_2%29%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ a=&#92;frac{1}{2} (r_1+r_2)} " class="latex" /> </p>
<p>is the semi-major axis of the orbit and </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+b%3D%5Csqrt%7Br_1+r_2%7D+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ b=&#92;sqrt{r_1 r_2} } " class="latex" /> </p>
<p>is the semi-minor axis.  But we can also relate <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=J&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="J" class="latex" /> to the period of the orbit, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T" class="latex" />, by integrating the rate at which orbital area is swept out by the planet:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D++r%5E2+%5Cfrac%7Bd+%5Ctheta%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7BJ%7D%7B2+m%7D+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{&#92;frac{1}{2}  r^2 &#92;frac{d &#92;theta}{d t} = &#92;frac{J}{2 m} } " class="latex" /> </p>
<p>over one orbit.  Since the area of an ellipse is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi+a+b&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;pi a b" class="latex" />, this gives us:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+J+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B2+%5Cpi+a+b+m%7D%7BT%7D+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ J = &#92;frac{2 &#92;pi a b m}{T} } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Equating these two expressions for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=J&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="J" class="latex" /> shows that the period is:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+T+%3D+2+%5Cpi+%5Csqrt%7B%5Cfrac%7Ba%5E3%7D%7BG+M%7D%7D%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ T = 2 &#92;pi &#92;sqrt{&#92;frac{a^3}{G M}}} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>So the period depends only on the semi-major axis; for a fixed value of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a" class="latex" />, it&#8217;s independent of the eccentricity.</p>
<p>As the eccentricity of the Earth&#8217;s orbit changes, the orbital period <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T" class="latex" />, and hence the semi-major axis <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a" class="latex" />, remains almost constant.  So, we have:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+U%3D%5Cfrac%7B2%5Cpi+C+m%7D%7BJ%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B2%5Cpi+C%7D%7Bb%7D+%5Csqrt%7B%5Cfrac%7Ba%7D%7BG+M%7D%7D+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ U=&#92;frac{2&#92;pi C m}{J} = &#92;frac{2&#92;pi C}{b} &#92;sqrt{&#92;frac{a}{G M}} } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Expressing the semi-minor axis in terms of the semi-major axis and the eccentricity, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b%5E2+%3D+a%5E2+%281-e%5E2%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="b^2 = a^2 (1-e^2)" class="latex" />, we get:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7BU%3D%5Cfrac%7B2%5Cpi+C%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7BG+M+a+%281-e%5E2%29%7D%7D%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{U=&#92;frac{2&#92;pi C}{&#92;sqrt{G M a (1-e^2)}}} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>So to second order in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="e" class="latex" />, we have:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7BU+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpi+C%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7BG+M+a%7D%7D+%282%2Be%5E2%29+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{U = &#92;frac{&#92;pi C}{&#92;sqrt{G M a}} (2+e^2) }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>The expressions simplify if we consider average rate of energy delivery over an orbit, which makes all the grungy constants related to gravitational dynamics go away:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B%5Cfrac%7BU%7D%7BT%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7BC%7D%7Ba%5E2+%5Csqrt%7B1-e%5E2%7D%7D+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{&#92;frac{U}{T} = &#92;frac{C}{a^2 &#92;sqrt{1-e^2}} } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>or to second order in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="e" class="latex" />:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7BU%7D%7BT%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7BC%7D%7Ba%5E2%7D+%281%2B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D+e%5E2%29+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{U}{T} = &#92;frac{C}{a^2} (1+&#92;frac{1}{2} e^2) } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>We can now work out how much the actual changes in the Earth&#8217;s orbit affect the amount of solar radiation it gets!  The eccentricity of the Earth&#8217;s orbit varies between 0.005 and 0.058.  The total energy the Earth gets each year from solar radiation is proportional to </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B1-e%5E2%7D%7D+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{1}{&#92;sqrt{1-e^2}} } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="e" class="latex" /> is the eccentricity.  When the eccentricity is at its lowest value, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e+%3D+0.005&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="e = 0.005" class="latex" />, we get</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B1-e%5E2%7D%7D+%3D+1.0000125+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{1}{&#92;sqrt{1-e^2}} = 1.0000125 } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>When the eccentricity is at its highest value, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e+%3D+0.058&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="e = 0.058" class="latex" />, we get</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B1-e%5E2%7D%7D+%3D+1.00168626+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{&#92;frac{1}{&#92;sqrt{1-e^2}} = 1.00168626 } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>So, the change is about </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B1.00168626%2F1.0000125+%3D+1.00167373+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{1.00168626/1.0000125 = 1.00167373 } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>In other words, a change of merely 0.167%.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s very small  And the effect on the Earth&#8217;s temperature would <i>naively</i> be even less!</p>
<p>Naively, we can treat the Earth as a <b><a href="http://www.taftan.com/thermodynamics/GREYBODY.HTM">greybody</a></b>: an ideal object whose tendency to absorb or emit radiation is the same at all wavelengths and temperatures. Since the temperature of a greybody is proportional to the fourth root of the power it receives, a 0.167% change in solar energy received per year corresponds to a percentage change in temperature roughly one fourth as big.  That&#8217;s a 0.042% change in temperature.   If we imagine starting with an Earth like ours, with an average temperature of roughly 290 kelvin, that&#8217;s a change of just 0.12 kelvin!  </p>
<p>The upshot seems to be this: <i>in a naive model without any amplifying effects, changes in the eccentricity of the Earth&#8217;s orbit would cause temperature changes of just 0.12 &deg;C!</i></p>
<p>This is much less than the roughly 5 &deg;C change we see between glacial and interglacial periods.  So, if changes in eccentricity are important in glacial cycles, we have some explaining to do.  Possible explanations include season-dependent phenomena and climate feedback effects.  Probably <i>both</i> are very important!  </p>
<p>Next time I&#8217;ll start talking about some theories of how Milankovitch cycles might cause the glacial cycles.  I thank Frederik De Roo, Martin Gisser and Cameron Smith for suggesting improvements to this issue before its release, over  <a href="http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Mathforge/Azimuth/comments.php?DiscussionID=793&amp;Focus=5206#Comment_5206">on the Azimuth Forum</a>.

				<div class="entry">
					<p>I was unable to access this blog last week while I was in Changchun&#8212;sorry!  </p>
<p>But I&#8217;m back in Singapore now, so here&#8217;s some news, mostly from the 2 August 2011 edition of <i>China Daily</i>, the government&#8217;s official English newspaper.  As you&#8217;ll see, they&#8217;re pretty concerned about environmental problems.   But to balance the picture, here&#8217;s a picture from Changbai Mountain, illustrating the awesome beauty of the parts of China that remain wild:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/diary/changbaishan/green_pool.jpg"><img width="400" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/diary/changbaishan/green_pool.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>The Chinese have fallen in love with cars.  Though less than 6% of Chinese own cars so far, that&#8217;s already <a href="http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90778/90860/7006415.html">75 million cars</a>, a market exceeded only by the US.</p>
<p>The price of real estate in China is shooting up&#8212;but as car ownership soars, you&#8217;ll have to pay a lot more if you want to buy a <i>parking lot</i> for your apartment.  The old apartments don&#8217;t have them.  In Beijing the average price of a parking lot is 140,000 yuan, which is about $22,000.  In Shanghai it&#8217;s 150,000 yuan.  But in fancy neighborhoods the price can be much higher: for example, up to 800,000 yuan in Beijing! </p>
<p>For comparison, the  <a href="http://english.sina.com/china/1/2007/0327/107816.html">average salary in Beijing</a> was 36,000 yuan in 2007&#8212;and the median is probably much lower, since there are lots of poor people and just a few rich ones.  On top of that, I bet this figure doesn&#8217;t include the many undocumented people who have come from the countryside to work in Beijing.  The big cities in China are much richer than the rest of the country: the average salary throughout the country was 11,000 yuan, and the average rural wage was just 3,600 yuan.  This disparity is causing young people to flood into the cities, leaving behind villages mostly full of old folks.</p>
<p>Thanks to intensive use of coal, increasing car ownership and often-ignored regulations, air quality is bad in most Chinese cities.  In Changchun, a typical summer day resembles the very worst days in Los Angeles, where the air is yellowish-grey except for a small blue region directly overhead.  </p>
<p>In a campaign to improve the air quality in Beijing, drivers are getting subsidized to turn in cars made in 1995 or earlier.  As usual, it&#8217;s the old clunkers that stink the worst: 27% of the cars in Beijing are over 8 years old, but they make 60% of the air pollution. The government is hoping to eliminate 400,000 old cars and cut the emission of nitrogen oxide by more than 10,000 tonnes per year by 2015.  </p>
<p>But this policy is also supposed to stoke the market for new automobiles.  That&#8217;s a bit strange, since Beijing is a huge city with massive traffic jams&#8212;some say the worst in the world! As a result, the government has taken strong steps to <i>limit</i> car sales in Beijing.</p>

<p>In Beijing, if you want to buy a car, you have to enter a lottery to get a license plate!   Car sales have been capped at 240,000 this year, and for the first lottery people&#8217;s chances of winning were just one in ten:</p>
<p>&bull; Louisa Lim, <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/01/26/133231061/license-plate-lottery-meant-to-curb-beijing-traffic">License plate lottery meant to curb Beijing traffic</a>, <i>Morning Edition</i>, 26 January 2011.</p>
<p>Why is the government trying to stoke new car sales in Beijing while simultaneously trying to limit them?  Maybe it&#8217;s just a rhetorical move to placate the car dealers, who hate the lottery system.  Or maybe it&#8217;s because the government makes money from selling cars: it&#8217;s a state-controlled industry.</p>
<p>On another front, since July there has been a drought in the provinces of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gansu">Gansu</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guizhou">Guizhou</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunan">Hunan</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_Mongolia">Inner Mongolia</a> autonomous region, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ningxia">Ningxia Hui autonomous region</a>, which is home to many non-Han ethnic groups including the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hui_people">Hui</a>.   It&#8217;s caused water shortages for 4.3 million people.  In some villages all the crops have died.  Drought relief agencies are sending out more water pumps and delivering drinking water.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gansu">Gansu</a> province, at least, the current drought is part of a bigger desertification process.</p>
<div align="center">

<p>Once they grew rice in Gansu, but then they moved to wheat:</p>
<p>&bull; Tu Xin-Yi, <a href="http://tw.tzuchi.org/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=707%3Adrought-in-gansu-&amp;catid=93%3Ahot-topic&amp;lang=en">Drought in Gansu</a>, <i>Tzu Chi</i>, 5 January 2011. </p>
<blockquote><p>
China is among the nations that are experiencing severe desertification. One of the hardest hit areas is Gansu Province, deep in the nation&#8217;s heartland. The province, which includes parts of the Gobi, Badain Jaran, and Tengger Deserts, is suffering moisture drawdown year after year. As water goes up into the air, so does irrigation and agriculture. People can hardly make a living from the arid land.</p>
<p>But the land was once quite rich and hospitable to agriculture, a far cry from what greets the eye today. Ruoli, in central Gansu, epitomizes the big dry-up. The area used to be verdant farmland where, with abundant rainfall, all kinds of plants grew lush and dense; but now the land is dry and yields next to nothing. All this dramatic change has come about in just 50 years—lightning-fast, a mere blink of an eye in geological terms.</p>
<p>Rapid desertification is forcing many parties, including the government, to take action. Some residents have moved away to seek better livelihoods elsewhere, and the government offers incentives for people to relocate to the lowlands Tzu Chi built a new village to accommodate some of these migrants.
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://tw.tzuchi.org/en/">Tzu Chi</a> is a Buddhist organization with a strong interest in <a href="http://tw.tzuchi.org/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=206%3Alets-protect-the-earth-together&amp;catid=82%3Amiscellaneous&amp;Itemid=326&amp;lang=en">climate change</a>.  The dramatic change they speak of seems to be part of a longer-term drying trend in this region.  Here is one of a series of watchtowers near <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunhuang">Dunhuang</a>, once a thriving city at the eastern end of the Silk Road.   I don&#8217;t think this area was such a desert back then:</p>

<p>Meanwhile, down in southern China, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangxi">Guanxi Zhuang autonomous region</a> is seeing its worst electricity shortage in the last 2 decades, with 30% of the demand for electric power unmet, and rolling blackouts.  They blame the situation on a shortage of coal and the fact that the local river isn&#8217;t deep enough to provide hydropower.</p>
<div align="center"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/China_Guangxi.svg/350px-China_Guangxi.svg.png" /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanxi"><img src="" alt="" /></a></div>
<p>On the bright side, China is investing a lot in wind power.  Their response to the financial crisis of of 2009 included $220 billion investment in renewable energy.  Baoding province is now one of the world&#8217;s <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43497449/ns/world_news-world_environment/t/power-surge-chinas-clean-energy-city/">centers for producing wind turbines</a>, and by 2020 China plans to have 100 gigawatts of peak wind power online.  </p>
<p>That&#8217;s pretty good!  Remember our discussion of <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Stabilization+wedges">Pacala and Socolow&#8217;s stabilization wedges</a>?   The world needs to reduce carbon emissions by roughly 10 gigatonnes per year by about 2050 to stay out of trouble.   Pacala and Socolow call each 1-gigatonne slice of this carbon pie a &#8216;wedge&#8217;.  We could reduce carbon emissions by one &#8216;wedge&#8217; by switching 700 gigawatts of coal power to 2000 gigawatts of peak wind power.  Why 700 of coal for 2000 of wind?   Because unfortunately most of the time wind power doesn&#8217;t work at peak efficiency!</p>
<p>So, the Chinese plan to do 1/20 of a wedge of wind power by 2020.  Multiply that effort by a factor of 200 worldwide by 2050, and we&#8217;ll be in okay shape.   That&#8217;s quite a challenge!  Of course we won&#8217;t do it all with wind.</p>
<p>And while the US and Europe are worried about excessive government and private debt, China is struggling to figure out how to manage its vast savings.  China has a $3.2 trillion foreign reserve, which is 30% of the world&#8217;s total.  The fraction invested in the US dollars has dropped from 71% in 1999 to 61% in 2010, but that&#8217;s still a lot of money, so any talk of the US defaulting, or a drop in the dollar, makes the Chinese government very nervous.  This article goes into a bit more detail:</p>
<p>&bull; Zhang Monan, <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/business/2011-08/02/content_13035089.htm">Dollar depreciation dilemma</a>, <i>China Daily</i>, 2 August 2011.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a move to keep the value of their foreign reserves and improve their ratio of return, an increasing number of countries have set up sovereign wealth funds in recent years, especially since the onset of the global financial crisis. So far, nearly 30 countries or regions have established sovereign wealth funds and the total assets at their disposal amounted to $3.98 trillion in early 2011. </p>
<p>Compared to its mammoth official foreign reserve, China has made much slower progress than many countries in the expansion of its sovereign wealth funds, especially in its stock investments. Currently, China has only three main sovereign wealth funds: One with assets of $347.1 billion is managed by the Hong Kong-based SAFE Investment Co Ltd; the second, with assets of $288.8 billion, is managed by the China Investment Corporation, a wholly State-owned enterprise engaging in foreign assets investment; the third fund of $146.5 billion is managed by the National Social Security Fund. </p>
<p>From the perspective of its investment structure, China&#8217;s sovereign wealth funds have long attached excessive importance to mobility and security. For example, the China Investment Corporation has invested 87.4 percent of its funds in cash assets and only 3.2 percent in stocks, in sharp contrast to the global average of 45 percent in stock investments. </p></blockquote>
<p>What&#8217;s interesting to me is that on the one hand we have these big problems, like global warming, and on the other hand these people with tons of money struggling to find good ways to invest it.  Is there a way to make each of these problems the solution to the other?   </p>

<p>If you&#8217;re on Google Plus, and you want to get Azimuth-related news items, please let me know, either here or there.  I&#8217;ll add you to my Azimuth circle. </p>
<p><b>Or even better</b>, tell me how to broadcast items on Google Plus so that 1) everyone can see them, but 2) only people who want Azimuth stuff <i>needs</i> to see them.  I can send stuff to &#8220;Public&#8221;, but so far I&#8217;ve been using that for fun stuff I think <i>everyone</i> would enjoy.  Maybe future improvements to Google Plus will help me solve my dilemma.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a sample of Azimuth items on Google Plus.  But note: these look a lot <i>nicer</i> on Google Plus.</p>
<p>&bull;  <a href="http://inhabitat.com/study-discovers-that-solar-panels-have-a-cooling-effect-on-buildings/">Solar panels could reduce heat reaching the rooftop by as much as 38%</a>. So, while making electricity you also spend less energy cooling your building in the summer. Not so nice in the winter, maybe.</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,15234798,00.html">Japan has been paying the dues for other countries in the International Whaling Commission</a> &mdash; and then these countries vote against banning whaling. Japanese academic Atsushi Ishii said that this form of vote-buying was &#8220;very likely,&#8221; but added &#8220;I would not call it corruption.&#8221;  Yeah, right.  But the good news: now things may change a bit, since the International Whaling Commission has decided to ban this practice!</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.good.is/post/liter-of-light-outfits-filipino-shacks-with-plastic-bottle-solar-bulbs/">A plastic bottle filled with water refracts sunlight and acts like a 55-watt bulb</a> &mdash; during the day, if you have a hole in your roof. For many that would be a good thing.</p>

This would be a good thing in many ways.  Even some bioethanol producers say they don&#8217;t need this subsidy anymore.  After all, there are laws requiring the use of ethanol in fuels, and as oil prices continue to rise, ethanol is becoming competitive.</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/print/2011-07-21/koch-exxon-mobil-among-corporations-helping-write-state-laws.html">Koch Industries Inc. and Exxon Mobil helped write legislation</a> that&#8217;s been introduced in Montana, New Mexico, New Hampshire, Oregon, Washington and other states in the USA.  It includes these words: “a tremendous amount of economic growth would be sacrificed for a reduction in carbon emissions that would have no appreciable impact on global concentrations of carbon dioxide.” They did this through an organization called the American Legislative Exchange Council (<a href="http://www.alec.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home">ALEC</a>).</p>

Students who viewed a fake &#8220;grassroots&#8221; website with arguments against the existence of manmade global warming not only became less certain about the cause of global warming; they also believed that the issue was less important than before!  Worst, the responses of participants who had viewed sites &#8220;Funded by Exxon-Mobil&#8221; weren&#8217;t different than those who had viewed sites funded by the &#8220;Conservation Heritage Fund,&#8221; by &#8220;donations by people like you,&#8221; or sites that didn&#8217;t list the source of funding at all.</p>

				<small>22 July, 2011</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>Anyone seriously interested in global warming needs to learn about the &#8216;ice ages&#8217;, or more technically &#8216;glacial periods&#8217;.  After all, these are some of the most prominent <i>natural</i> variations in the Earth&#8217;s temperature.  And they&#8217;re rather mysterious.   They could be caused by changes in the Earth&#8217;s orbit called <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Milankovitch+cycle">Milankovich cycles</a>&#8230; but the evidence is not completely compelling.  I want to talk about that.</p>
<p>But to understand ice ages, the first thing we need to know is that the Earth hasn&#8217;t always had them!  The Earth&#8217;s climate has been cooling and becoming more erratic for the last 35 million years, with full-blown glacial periods kicking in only about 1.8 million years ago.  </p>
<p>So, this week let&#8217;s start with a little tour of the Earth&#8217;s climate history.  Somewhat arbitrarily, let&#8217;s begin with the extinction of the dinosaurs about 65 million years ago.   Here&#8217;s a graph of what the temperature has been doing since then:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://www.globalwarmingart.com/wiki/File:65_Myr_Climate_Change_Rev_png"><img width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature/65Myr.png" alt="" /></a></div>
<p>Of course you should have lots of questions about how this graph was made, and how well we really know these ancient temperatures!  But for now I&#8217;m just giving a quick overview&mdash;click on the graphs for more.  In future weeks I should delve into more technical details.  </p>
<h4> The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eocene">Paleocene Epoch</a>, 65 &#8211; 55 million years ago </h4>
<p>The Paleocene began with a bang, as an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicxulub_crater">asteroid 10 kilometers across</a> hit the Gulf of Mexico in an explosion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicxulub_crater#Impact_specifics">two million times larger</a> than the biggest nuclear weapon ever detonated.  A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megatsunami">megatsunami</a> thousands of meters high ripped across the Atlantic, and molten quartz hurled high into the atmosphere ignited wildfires over the whole planet.  A day to remember, for sure.</p>
<p>The Earth looked like this back then:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://www.scotese.com/K/t.htm"><img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.scotese.com/images/066.jpg" alt="" /></a></div>
<p>The Paleocene started out <i>hot</i>: the ocean was 10&deg; to 15&deg; Celsius warmer than today.   Then it got even hotter!  Besides a gradual temperature rise, at the very end of this epoch there was a drastic incident called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleocene-Eocene_Thermal_Maximum">Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum</a>&mdash; that&#8217;s the spike labelled &quot;PETM&quot;. Ocean surface  temperatures worldwide shot up by 5-8&deg;C for a few thousand years&mdash;but in the Arctic, it heated up even more, to a balmy 23&deg;C.   This caused a severe dieoff of little ocean critters called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foraminifera">foraminifera</a>, and a drastic change of the dominant mammal species.  What caused it?  That&#8217;s a good question, but right now I&#8217;m just giving you a quick tour.  </p>
<h4> The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eocene">Eocene Epoch</a>, 55 &#8211; 34 million years ago </h4>
<p>During the Eocene, temperatures continued to rise until the so-called &#8216;Eocene Optimum&#8217;, about halfway through.  Even at the start, the continents were close to where they are now&mdash;but the average annual temperature in arctic Canada and Siberia was a balmy 18 &deg;C.  The dominant plants up there were palm trees and cycads.  Fossil monitor lizards (sort of like alligators)  dating back to this era have been found in <a href="http://www.mapzones.com/world/europe/greenland/mapindex.php">Svalbard</a>,  an island north of Greenland that&#8217;s now covered with ice all year.  Antarctica was home to cool temperate forests, including  beech trees and ferns.  In particular, our Earth had <i>no permanent polar ice caps!</i>  </p>
<p>Life back then was very different.   The biggest member of the order <a href="http://tolweb.org/tree?group=Carnivora&amp;contgroup=Eutheria">Carnivora</a>, which now includes dogs, cats, bears, and the like, was merely the size of a housecat.  The largest predatory mammals were of another, now extinct order: the <a href="http://www.paleocene-mammals.de/predators.htm">creodonts</a>, like this one drawn by Dmitry Bogdanov:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creodonta"><br />
<img width="300" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Patriofelis22DB.jpg" alt="" /></a>
</div>
<p>But the biggest predator of all was not a mammal: it was<br />
<a href="http://hoopermuseum.earthsci.carleton.ca//flightless/diatryma.htm">Diatryma</a>,  the 8-foot tall &quot;terror bird&quot;, with a fearsome beak!</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creodonta"><br />
<img width="300" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/diatryma.jpg" alt="" /></a></div>
<p>But it&#8217;s not as huge as it looks here, because horses were only <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_the_horse#Hyracotherium">half a meter high back then</a>!</p>
<p>For more on this strange world and its end as the Earth cooled, see:</p>
<p>&bull; Donald R. Prothero, <i>The Eocene-Oligocene Transition: Paradise Lost</i>, Critical Moments in Paleobiology and Earth History Series, Columbia University Press, New York, 1994.</p>
<h4> The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligocene">Oligocene Epoch</a>, 34 &#8211; 24 million years ago</h4>
<p>As the Eocene drew to a close, temperatures began to drop.  And at the start of the Oligocene, they plummeted!   Glaciers started forming in Antarctica.  The growth of ice sheets led to a dropping of the sea level. Tropical jungles gave ground to cooler woodlands.  </p>
<p>What caused this?  That&#8217;s another good question.  Some seek the answer in plate tectonics.  The Oligocene is when India collided with Asia, throwing up the Himalayas and the vast Tibetan plateau. Some argue this led to a significant change in global weather patterns. But this is also the time when Australia and South America finally separated from Antarctica. Some argue that the formation of an ocean completely surrounding Antarctica led to the cooling weather patterns. After all, that lets cold water go round and round Antarctica without ever being driven up towards the equator.</p>
<h4> The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miocene">Miocene Epoch</a>, 24 &#8211; 5.3 million years ago </h4>
<div align="center"><a href="http://www.scotese.com/miocene.htm"><img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.scotese.com/images/014.jpg" alt="" /></a></div>
<p>Near the end of the Oligocene temperatures shot up again and the Antarctic thawed.   Then it cooled, then it warmed again&#8230; but by the middle of the Miocene, temperatures began to drop more seriously, and glaciers again formed on the Antarctic.  It&#8217;s been frozen ever since.  Why all these temperature fluctuations?  That&#8217;s another good question. </p>
<p>The Miocene is when grasslands first became common. It&#8217;s sort of amazing that something we take so much for granted&mdash;grass&mdash;can be so new! But grasslands, as opposed to thicker forests and jungles, are characteristic of cooler climates. And as Nigel Calder has suggested, grasslands were crucial to the development of humans!  Early hominids lived on the border between forests and grasslands.  That has a lot to do with why we stand on our hind legs and have hands rather than paws.  Much later, the agricultural revolution relied heavily on grasses like <a href="http://waynesword.palomar.edu/ecoph12.htm">wheat, rice, corn, sorghum, rye, and millet</a>. As we ate more of these plants, we drastically transformed them by breeding, and removed forests to grow more grasses.  In return, the grasses drastically transformed us: the ability to stockpile surplus grains ended our hunter-gatherer lifestyle and gave rise to cities, kingdoms, and slave labor.</p>
<p>So, you could say we coevolved with grasses!</p>
<p>Indeed, the sequence of developments leading to humans came shortly after the rise of grasslands. Apes split off from monkeys 21 million years ago, in the Miocene. The genus <i>Homo</i> split off from other apes like gorillas and chimpanzees 5 million years ago, near the beginning of the Pliocene.  The fully bipedal <i>Homo erectus</i> dates back to 1.9 million years ago, near the end of the Pliocene.  But we&#8217;re getting ahead of ourselves&#8230;</p>
<h4> The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliocene">Pliocene Epoch</a>, 5.3 &#8211; 1.8 million years ago </h4>
<div align="center"><a href="http://www.globalwarmingart.com/wiki/File:Five_Myr_Climate_Change_Rev_png"><img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature/5Myr.png" alt="" /></a></div>
<p>Starting around the Pliocene, the Earth&#8217;s temperature has been getting every more <i>jittery</i> as it cools.  Something is making the temperature unstable!  And these fluctuations are not just getting more severe&mdash;they&#8217;re also lasting longer.</p>
<p>These temperature fluctuations are far from being neatly periodic, despite the optimistic labels on the above graph saying &#8220;41 kiloyear cycle&#8221; and &#8220;100 kiloyear cycle&#8221;.  And beware: the data in the above graph was manipulated so it would synchronize with the Milankovitch cycles!  Is that really justified?  Do these cycles really cause the changes in the Earth&#8217;s climate?  More good questions.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a graph that shows more clearly the noisy nature of the Earth&#8217;s climate in the last 7 million years:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pliocene_benthic_carbonate_18O.png"><img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature/7Myr.png" alt="" /></a></div>
<p>You can tell this graph was made by a real paleontologist, because they like to put the present on the <i>left</i> instead of on the right. </p>
<p>And maybe you&#8217;re getting curious about this &#8220;&delta;<sup>18</sup>O benthic carbonate&#8221; business?  Well, we can&#8217;t directly measure the temperatures long ago by sticking a thermometer into an ancient rock!   We need to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_%28climate%29">&#8216;climate proxies&#8217;</a>: things we can measure now, that we <i>believe</i> are correlated to features of the climate long ago.  &delta;<sup>18</sup>O is the change in the amount of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen-18">oxygen-18</a> (a less common, heavier isotope of oxygen) in carbonate deposits dug up from ancient ocean sediments.  These deposits were made by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foraminifera">foraminifera</a> and other tiny ocean critters.  The amount of oxygen-18 in these deposits is used as temperature proxy: the more of it there is, the colder we think it was.  Why?  That&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9418O">another good question</a>.</p>
<h4> The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleistocene">Pleistocene Epoch</a>, 1.8 &#8211; .01 million years ago </h4>
<p>By the beginning of the Pleistocene, the Earth&#8217;s jerky temperature variations became full-fledged <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_age">&#8216;glacial cycles&#8217;</a>.  In the last million years there have been about ten glacial cycles, though it&#8217;s hard to count them in any precise way&mdash;it&#8217;s like counting mountains in a mountain range:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature.html#6Myr"><img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature/6Myr.jpg" alt="" /></a></div>
<p>Now the present is on the right again&mdash;but just to keep you on your toes, here <i>up</i> means <i>cold</i>, or at least more oxygen-18.  I copied this graph from:</p>
<p>&bull; Barry Saltzman, <em>Dynamical Paleoclimatology: Generalized<br />
Theory of Global Climate Change</em>, Academic Press, New York,<br />
2002, fig. 1-4.</p>
<p>We can get some more detail on the last four glacial periods from the change in the amount of deuterium in <a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/icecore/antarctica/vostok/vostok.html">Vostok</a> and <a href="http://www.esf.org/index.php?id=855">EPICA</a> ice core samples, and also changes in the amount of oxygen-18 in foraminifera (that&#8217;s the graph labelled &#8216;Ice Volume&#8217;):</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://www.globalwarmingart.com/wiki/File:Ice_Age_Temperature_Rev_png"><img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature/450kyr.png" alt="" /></a></div>
<p>As you can see here, the third-to-last glacial ended about 380,000 years ago.  In the warm period that followed, the first signs of <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neanderthal">Homo neanderthalensis</a></em> appear about 350,000 years ago, and the first  <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_sapiens">Homo sapiens</a></em> about 250,000 years ago.</p>
<p>Then, 200,000 years ago, came the second-to-last glacial period: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolstonian_Stage">Wolstonian</a>.  This lasted until about 130,000 years ago.  Then came a warm period called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eemian">Eemian</a>, which lasted until about 110,000 years ago.  During the Eemian, Neanderthalers hunted rhinos in Switzerland!  It was a bit warmer then that it is now, and sea levels may have been about 4-6 meters higher&mdash;worth thinking about, if you&#8217;re interested in the effects of global warming.  </p>
<p>The last glacial period started around 110,000 years ago.  This is called the Winsconsinan or W&uuml;rm period, depending on location&#8230; but let&#8217;s just call it the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_glacial_period">last glacial period</a>.   </p>
<p>A lot happened during the last glacial period.  <i>Homo sapiens</i> reached the Middle East 100,000 years ago, and arrived in central Asia 50 thousand years ago.  The Neanderthalers died out in Asia around that time.  They died out in Europe 35 thousand years ago, about when <i>Homo sapiens</i> got there.  Anyone notice a pattern?</p>
<p>The oldest cave paintings are 32 thousand years old, and the oldest known calendars and flutes also date back to about this time.   It&#8217;s striking how many radical innovations go back to about this time.  </p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://www.scotese.com/lastice.htm"><img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.scotese.com/images/LGM.jpg" alt="" /></a></div>
<p>The glaciers reached their maximum extent around 26 to 18 thousand years ago.   There were ice sheets down to the Great Lakes in America, and covering the British Isles, Scandinavia, and northern Germany.  Much of Europe was tundra.   And so much water was locked up in ice that the sea level was <a href="http://www.cmar.csiro.au/sealevel/sl_hist_intro.html">120 meters lower</a> than it is today!  </p>
<p>Then things started to warm up.  About 18 thousand years ago, <i>Homo sapiens</i> arrived in America.   In Eurasia, people started cultivating plants and herding of animals around this time.  </p>
<p>There was, however, a shocking setback 12,700 years ago: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Younger_Dryas">Younger Dryas</a> episode, a cold period lasting about 1,300 years.  We talked about this in <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/10/15/this-weeks-finds-week-304/">&#8220;week304&#8221;</a>, so I won&#8217;t go into it again here.  </p>
<p>The Younger Dryas ended about 11,500 years ago.  The last glacial period, and with it the Pleistocene, officially ended 10,000 years ago.  Or more precisely: 10,000 BP.  Whenever I&#8217;ve been saying &#8216;years ago&#8217;, I really mean <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Present">&#8216;Before Present&#8217;</a>, where the &#8216;present&#8217;, you&#8217;ll be amused to learn, is officially set in 1950.  Of course the precise definition of &#8216;the present&#8217; doesn&#8217;t matter much for very ancient events, but it would be annoying if a thousand years from now we had to revise all the textbooks to say the Pleistocene ended 11,000 years ago.  It&#8217;ll still be 10,000 BP.  </p>
<p>(But if 1950 was the <i>present</i>, now it&#8217;s the <i>future!</i>  This could explain why such weird science-fiction-type stuff is happening.)</p>
<h4> The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene">Holocene Epoch</a>, .01 &#8211; 0 million years ago </h4>
<p>As far as geology goes, the Holocene is a rather silly epoch, not like the rest.  It&#8217;s just a name for the time since the last ice age ended.  In the long run it&#8217;ll probably be called the Early <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropocene">Anthropocene</a>, since it marks the start of truly massive impacts of <i>Homo sapiens</i> on the biosphere.  We may have started killing off species in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternary_extinction_event">late Pleistocene</a>, but now <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_extinction">we&#8217;re killing more</a>&mdash;and changing the climate, perhaps even <a href="http://geosci.uchicago.edu/~archer/reprints/archer.2005.trigger.pdf">postponing the next glacial period</a>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what the temperature has been doing since 12000 BC:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://www.globalwarmingart.com/wiki/File:Holocene_Temperature_Variations_Rev_png"><img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.globalwarmingart.com/images/b/bb/Holocene_Temperature_Variations_Rev.png" alt="" /></a></div>
<p>Finally, here&#8217;s a closeup of a tiny sliver of time: the last 2000 years:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://www.globalwarmingart.com/wiki/File:2000_Year_Temperature_Comparison_png"><img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.globalwarmingart.com/images/c/c1/2000_Year_Temperature_Comparison.png" /></a></div>
<p>In both these graphs, different colored lines correspond to different studies; click for details.  The biggish error bars give people lots to argue about, as you may have noticed.  But right now I&#8217;m more interested in the big picture, and questions like these:</p>
<p>&bull; Why was it so hot in the early Eocene?</p>
<p>&bull; Why has it generally been cooling down ever since the Eocene?</p>
<p>&bull;  Why have temperature fluctuations been growing since the Miocene?  </p>
<p>&bull;  What causes the glacial cycles?   </p>
<h4>For More</h4>
<p>Next time we&#8217;ll get into a bit more detail.  For now, here are some fun easy things to read.  </p>
<p>This is a very enjoyable overview of climate change during the Holocene, and its effect on human civilization:</p>
<p>&bull; Brian Fagan, <i>The Long Summer</i>, Basic Books, New York, 2005.  Summary available at <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/The+Long+Summer">Azimuth Library</a>.</p>
<p>These dig a bit further back:</p>
<p>&bull; Chris Turney, <i>Ice, Mud and Blood: Lessons from Climates Past</i>, Macmillan, New York, 2008.</p>
<p>&bull; Steven Mithen, <i>After the Ice: A Global Human History 20,000-5000 BC</i>, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 2005.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t stomach the style of the second one: it&#8217;s written as a narrative, with a character named Lubbock travelling through time.  But a lot of people like it, and they say it&#8217;s well-researched.</p>
<p>For a history of how people discovered and learned about ice ages, try:</p>
<p>&bull; Doug Macdougall, <i>Frozen Earth: The Once and Future Story of Ice Ages</i>, University of California Press, Berkeley, 2004.</p>
<p>For something a bit more technical, but still introductory, try:</p>
<p>&bull; Richard W. Battarbee and Heather A. Binney, <i>Natural Climate Variability and Global Warming: a Holocene Perspective</i>, Wiley-Blackwell, Chichester, 2008.</p>
<p>To learn how this graph was made:</p>
<div align="center">

<p>and read a good overview of the Earth&#8217;s climate throughout the Cenozoic, read this:</p>
<p>&bull; James Zachos, Mark Pagani, Lisa Sloan, Ellen Thomas and Katharina Billups, <a href="http://www.essc.psu.edu/essc_web/seminars/spring2006/jan18/Zachosetal.pdf">Trends, rhythms, and aberrations in global climate 65 Ma to present</a>, <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/292/5517/686"><i>Science</i></a> <b>292</b> (27 April 2001), 686-693. </p>
<p>I got the beautiful maps illustrating continental drift from here:</p>
<p>&bull; Christopher R. Scotes, <a href="http://www.scotese.com/">Paleomap Project</a>.</p>
<p>and I urge you to check out this website for a nice visual tour of the Earth&#8217;s history.</p>
<p>Finally, I thank Frederik de Roo and Nathan Urban for suggesting improvements to this issue.  You can see what they said <a href="http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Mathforge/Azimuth/comments.php?DiscussionID=758&amp;Focus=4842#Comment_4842">on the Azimuth Forum</a>.  If you <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Forum+help">join</a> the forum, you too can help write This Week&#8217;s Finds!  I could really use help from earth scientists, biologists, paleontologists and folks like that: I&#8217;m okay at math and physics, but I&#8217;m trying to broaden the scope now.</p>

				<small>14 July, 2011</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>It&#8217;s hot in the United States!  This picture from the <a href="http://www.nnvl.noaa.gov/">NOAA Environmental Visualization Laboratory</a> shows the temperature at 5 pm Eastern Time on the 12th of July:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://www.nnvl.noaa.gov/MediaDetail.php?MediaID=775&amp;MediaTypeID=1"><img width="450" src="http://www.nnvl.noaa.gov/images/low_resolution/775_20110712_US_Heatwave.jpg" /></a>
</div>
<p>Half the population is suffering under <a href="http://www.weather.gov/glossary/index.php?word=heat%20advisory">&#8216;heat advisories&#8217;</a>.   These kick in when the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_index">heat index</a>&#8212;a measure of perceived temperature that takes humidity into account&#8212;surpasses 105°F (about 40 &deg;C), or when the nighttime low exceeds 80°F (about 27 &deg;C) for two consecutive nights.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/post/us-bakes-under-extreme-heat-half-of-population-under-heat-advisory-or-warning/2011/07/12/gIQAMUO1AI_blog.html?tid=sm_twitter_washingtonpost">Capital Weather Gang</a> has to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>East of the continental divide, it&#8217;s difficult to escape today&#8217;s searing heat.  <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/JustinNOAA/status/90833518246105088">NOAA reported</a> that as of 1 p.m., heat advisories or excessive heat warnings  affected 150 million Americans in 23 states.  Washington, D.C. had been under a heat advisory earlier today, but it was canceled when it became clear temperatures would fall just below advisory criteria.</p>
<p>Almost all of the south central and southeast states have seen <a target="_blank" href="http://www.weather.com/maps/maptype/currentweatherusnational/uscurrentheatindex_large.html?clip=undefined&amp;region=undefined&amp;collection=localwxforecast&amp;presname=undefined">heat indices exceed 105 degrees Tuesday afternoon</a>.  Some sample readings at 3 p.m.: Little Rock 109, St. Louis 109, Raleigh 105, Memphis 111, Charleston 108.</p>
<p>In recent days, the searing heat has set scores of new record high  temperatures across the eastern two thirds of the country.  Yesterday alone, 41 record highs were set including Ft. Smith, Ar. (107), Indianapolis, In. (96), Louisville, Ky. (97), Watertown, Ny. (90), Altoona, Pa. (94), and Charleston, WV (95).</p>
<p>Record high minimum temperatures have been more even pervasive, offering little nighttime relief from the oppressive afternoon heat. On Monday, 132 record high lows were set.</p>
<p>In Louisville, Kentucky this morning, the low dropped to a mere 84 degrees.  Meteorologist Eric Fisher at The Weather Channel <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/#!/EricFisherTWC/status/90780128975667200">tweeted</a>: &ldquo;That. Is. Filthy. Heat Index was still above 100 at 5am.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Some of the most remarkable heat occurred on in central Plains on July 9 and 10.  Oklahoma City reached 110 degrees on the 9th, tying its all-time high for the month.  Wichita, Kansas rose to 111 degrees on the 10th, its hottest temperature in 30 years. See <a target="_blank" href="http://capitalclimate.blogspot.com/2011/07/110-temperatures-scorch-oklahoma-record.html">CapitalClimate for more on the records</a> which extended into Arkansas and Missouri.</p>
<p>In both Oklahoma City (13 days) and Dallas (10  days), the mercury has reached  100 or better for at least ten straight days. Hot weather is predicted to persist there through the weekend, at least.</p>
<p>Across the country during the month of July, record highs have outnumbered record lows 349 to 68 (or more than 5:1).
</p></blockquote>
<p>Could any of this be related to, umm, global warming?  Joe Romm has a blistering critique of the American media&#8217;s failure to mention this possibility:</p>
<p>&bull; Joe Romm, <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/romm/2011/07/13/267754/heat-wave-nbc/">After Story on Monster Heat Wave, NBC Asks “What Explains This?” The Answer: “We’re Stuck in a Summer Pattern”!</a>, <i>Climate Progress</i>, 13 July 2011.</p>
<p>Inference is a tricky business.  It&#8217;s easy to spot patterns where they don&#8217;t exist, especially when the patterns are as subtle as an increase in extreme weather events, also known as <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/17/opinion/17friedman.html">&#8216;global weirding&#8217;</a>.   If there&#8217;s a flood, or a drought, we can easily explain it this way.  The human mind, after all, is programmed to seek out patterns: we can see faces in clouds.  </p>
<p>But it&#8217;s also easy to fail to recognize patterns where they do exist&#8212;especially when acknowledging them would require difficult changes in behavior.  &#8220;Am I an alcoholic?  No, I just got really drunk last night&#8230; and, okay, the night before&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Earlier this spring, Bill McKibben had a sarcastic editorial about this:</p>
<p>&bull; Bill McKibben, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/a-link-between-climate-change-and-joplin-tornadoes-never/2011/05/23/AFrVC49G_story.html">A link between climate change and Joplin tornadoes? Never!</a>, <i>Washington Post</i>, 24 May 2011.</p>
<p>It starts:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Caution: It is vitally important not to make connections. When you see pictures of rubble like <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/official-fatalities-reported-as-tornado-hits-southwest-missouri/2011/05/22/AFXAiP9G_story.html">this week&rsquo;s shots from Joplin, Mo.</a>, you should not wonder: Is this somehow related to the tornado outbreak three weeks ago <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/the-tuscaloosa-tornado-aftermath-viewed-through-an-ambulances-windshield/2011/04/28/AFdTrU8E_story.html">in Tuscaloosa, Ala.</a>, or the enormous outbreak a couple of weeks before that (which, together, comprised the most active April for tornadoes in U.S. history). No, that doesn&#8217;t mean a thing.</p>
<p>It is far better to think of these as isolated, unpredictable, discrete events. It is not advisable to try to connect them in your mind with, say, the fires burning across Texas &mdash; fires that have burned more of America at this point this year than any wildfires have in previous years. Texas, and adjoining parts of Oklahoma and New Mexico, are drier than they&#8217;ve ever been &mdash; the drought is worse than that of the Dust Bowl. But do not wonder if they&#8217;re somehow connected. </p>
<p>If you did wonder, you see, you would also have to wonder about whether this year’s record snowfalls and rainfalls across the Midwest — resulting in record flooding along the Mississippi — could somehow be related. And then you might find your thoughts wandering to, oh, global warming, and to the fact that climatologists have been predicting for years that as we flood the atmosphere with carbon we will also start both drying and flooding the planet, since warm air holds more water vapor than cold air.</p>
<p>It’s far smarter to repeat to yourself the comforting mantra that no single weather event can ever be directly tied to climate change. There have been tornadoes before, and floods — that’s the important thing. Just be careful to make sure you don’t let yourself wonder why all these record-breaking events are happening in such proximity — that is, why there have been unprecedented megafloods in Australia, New Zealand and Pakistan in the past year. Why it’s just now that the Arctic has melted for the first time in thousands of years. No, better to focus on the immediate casualties, watch the videotape from the store cameras as the shelves are blown over. Look at the news anchorman standing in his waders in the rising river as the water approaches his chest. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Luckily, scientists are busy at work on these questions.  For example, these papers on floods came out in February:</p>
<p>&bull; Pardeep Pall, Tolu Aina, Dáithí Stone, Peter Stott, Toru Nozawa, Arno Hilberts, Dag Lohmann, and Myles Allen, Anthropogenic greenhouse gas contribution to flood risk in England and Wales in autumn 2000, <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v470/n7334/full/nature09762.html"><i>Nature</i></a> <b>470</b>  (17 February 2011), 382–385.  <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v470/n7334/extref/nature09762-s1.pdf">Supplementary information available for free online</a>.</p>
<p>&bull; Seung-Ki Min,    Xuebin Zhang,     Francis W. Zwiers and Gabriele C. Hegerl, Human contribution to more-intense precipitation extremes, <i><a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v470/n7334/full/nature09763.html">Nature</a></i> <b>470</b> (17 February 2011), 378-381.</p>
<p>I believe that someday we <i>will</i> understand whether and how extreme weather events are linked to global warming&mdash;if not individually, at least statistically.  Whether we&#8217;ll understand it soon enough for it to make much difference&#8212;I&#8217;m less sure about that.</p>
<p>Luckily, I&#8217;m back in Singapore now, so I don&#8217;t <i>personally</i> have to worry about the heat wave in the USA.  No heat advisory here!  The weather is quite normal, with the heat index a nice cool 100 &deg;F (or 38 &deg;C).  </p>

			<div class="textwidget"><p>You can <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics">include math in your comments using LaTeX</a>,  but you need to do it this way:</p>
<p>&#036;latex  E = mc^2&#036;</p>
<p>You need the word 'latex' right after the first dollar sign, and it needs a space after it.  Double dollar signs don't work, and other limitations apply, some described <a href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/latex/">here</a>.  You can't preview comments here, but I'm happy to fix errors.</p>
