<p>In <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/04/07/resource-convertibility-part-1/">Part 1</a>, I introduced ordered commutative monoids as a mathematical formalization of resources and their convertibility. Today I&#8217;m going to say something about what to do with this formalization. Let&#8217;s start with a quick recap!</p>
<p><b>Definition</b>: An <b>ordered commutative monoid</b> is a set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> equipped with a binary relation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgeq%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;geq," class="latex" /> a binary operation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%2B%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="+," class="latex" /> and a distinguished element <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="0" class="latex" /> such that the following hold:</p>
<p>&bull; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%2B&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="+" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="0" class="latex" /> equip <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> with the structure of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoid#Commutative_monoid">commutative monoid</a>;</p>
<p>&bull; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgeq&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;geq" class="latex" /> equips <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> with the structure of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set">partially ordered set</a>;</p>
<p>&bull; addition is monotone: if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5Cgeq+y%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x&#92;geq y," class="latex" /> then also <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%2B+z+%5Cgeq+y+%2B+z.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x + z &#92;geq y + z." class="latex" /></p>
<p>Recall also that we think of the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2Cy%5Cin+A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x,y&#92;in A" class="latex" /> as resource objects such that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2By&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x+y" class="latex" /> represents the object consisting of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y" class="latex" /> together, and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5Cgeq+y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x&#92;geq y" class="latex" /> means that the resource object <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> can be converted into <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y." class="latex" /></p>
<p>When confronted with an abstract definition like this, many people ask: so what is it useful for? The answer to this is twofold: first, it provides a language which we can use to guide our thoughts in any application context. Second, the <i>definition</i> itself is just the very start: we can now also prove <i>theorems</i> about ordered commutative monoids, which can be instantiated in any particular application context. So the theory of ordered commutative monoids will provide a useful toolbox for talking about concrete resource theories and studying them. In the remainder of this post, I&#8217;d like to say a bit about what this toolbox contains. For more, you&#8217;ll have to read <a href="http://perimeterinstitute.ca/personal/tfritz/ordered_commutative_monoids.pdf">the paper</a>!</p>
<p>To start, let&#8217;s consider <i>catalysis</i> as one of the resource-theoretic phenomena neatly captured by ordered commutative monoids. Catalysis is the phenomenon that certain conversions become possible only due to the presence of a <b>catalyst</b>, which is an additional resource object which does not get consumed in the process of the conversion. For example, we have</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctext%7Btimber+%2B+nails%7D%5Cnot%5Cgeq+%5Ctext%7Btable%7D%2C+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;text{timber + nails}&#92;not&#92;geq &#92;text{table}, " class="latex" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctext%7Btimber+%2B+nails+%2B+saw+%2B+hammer%7D+%5Cgeq+%5Ctext%7Btable+%2B+saw+%2B+hammer%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;text{timber + nails + saw + hammer} &#92;geq &#92;text{table + saw + hammer}" class="latex" /></p>
<p>because making a table from timber and nails requires a saw and a hammer as tools. So in this example, &#8216;saw <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%2B&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="+" class="latex" /> hammer&#8217; is a catalyst for the conversion of &#8216;timber <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%2B&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="+" class="latex" /> nails&#8217; into &#8216;table&#8217;. In mathematical language, catalysis occurs precisely when the ordered commutative monoid is not <b>cancellative</b>, which means that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%2B+z%5Cgeq+y+%2B+z&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x + z&#92;geq y + z" class="latex" /> sometimes holds even though <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5Cgeq+y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x&#92;geq y" class="latex" /> does not. So, the notion of catalysis perfectly matches up with a very natural and familiar notion from algebra.</p>
<p>One can continue along these lines and study those ordered commutative monoids which are cancellative. It turns out that every ordered commutative monoid can be <i>made</i> cancellative in a universal way; in the resource-theoretic interpretation, this boils down to replacing the convertibility relation by <b>catalytic convertibility</b>, in which <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> is declared to be convertible into <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y" class="latex" /> as soon as there exists a catalyst which achieves this conversion. Making an ordered commutative monoid cancellative like this is a kind of &#8216;regularization&#8217;: it leads to a mathematically more well-behaved structure. As it turns out, there are several additional steps of regularization that can be performed, and all of these are both mathematically natural and have an appealing resource-theoretic interpretation. These regularizations successively take us from the world of ordered commutative monoids to the realm of linear algebra and functional analysis, where powerful theorems are available. For now, let me not go into the details, but only try to summarize one of the consequences of this development. This requires a bit of preparation.</p>
<p>In many situations, it is not just of interest to convert a single copy of some resource object <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> into a single copy of some <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3B&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y;" class="latex" /> instead, one may be interested in converting <i>many</i> copies of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> into <i>many</i> copies of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y" class="latex" /> all together, and thereby maximizing (or minimizing) the ratio of the resulting number of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y" class="latex" />&#8216;s compared to the number of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" />&#8216;s that get consumed. This ratio is measured by the maximal rate:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+R_%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bmax%7D%7D%28x%5Cto+y%29+%3D+%5Csup+%5Cleft%5C%7B+%5Cfrac%7Bm%7D%7Bn%7D+%5C%3A%7C%5C%3A+nx+%5Cgeq+my+%5Cright%5C%7D+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ R_{&#92;mathrm{max}}(x&#92;to y) = &#92;sup &#92;left&#92;{ &#92;frac{m}{n} &#92;:|&#92;: nx &#92;geq my &#92;right&#92;} }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>Here, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="m" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" /> are natural numbers, and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=nx&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="nx" class="latex" /> stands for the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" />-fold sum <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2B%5Ccdots%2Bx%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x+&#92;cdots+x," class="latex" /> and similarly for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=my.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="my." class="latex" /> So this maximal rate quantifies how many <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y" class="latex" />’ s we can get out of one copy of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x," class="latex" /> when working in a &#8216;mass production&#8217; setting. There is also a notion of <b>regularized rate</b>, which has a slightly more complicated definition that I don&#8217;t want to spell out here, but is similar in spirit. The toolbox of ordered commutative monoids now provides the following result:</p>
<p><b>Rate Theorem:</b> If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5Cgeq+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x&#92;geq 0" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%5Cgeq+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y&#92;geq 0" class="latex" /> in an ordered commutative monoid <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> which satisfies a mild technical assumption, then the maximal regularized rate from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y" class="latex" /> can be computed like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+R_%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bmax%7D%7D%5E%7B%5Cmathrm%7Breg%7D%7D%28x%5Cto+y%29+%3D+%5Cinf_f+%5Cfrac%7Bf%28y%29%7D%7Bf%28x%29%7D+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ R_{&#92;mathrm{max}}^{&#92;mathrm{reg}}(x&#92;to y) = &#92;inf_f &#92;frac{f(y)}{f(x)} }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" /> ranges over all functionals on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28y%29%5Cneq+0.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f(y)&#92;neq 0." class="latex" /></p>
<p>Wait a minute, what&#8217;s a &#8216;functional&#8217;? It&#8217;s defined to be a map <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%3AA%5Cto%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f:A&#92;to&#92;mathbb{R}" class="latex" /> which is monotone,</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5Cgeq+y+%5C%3A%5CRightarrow%5C%3A+f%28x%29%5Cgeq+f%28y%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x&#92;geq y &#92;:&#92;Rightarrow&#92;: f(x)&#92;geq f(y)" class="latex" /></p>
<p>and additive,</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%2By%29+%3D+f%28x%29+%2B+f%28y%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y)" class="latex" /></p>
<p>In economic terms, we can think of a functional as a consistent assignment of prices to all resource objects. If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> is at least as useful as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y," class="latex" /> then the price of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> should be at least as high as the price of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y" class="latex" />; and the price of two objects together should be the sum of their individual prices. So the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" /> in the rate formula above ranges over all &#8216;markets&#8217; on which resource objects can be &#8216;traded&#8217; at consistent prices. The term &#8216;functional&#8217; is supposed to hint at a relation to functional analysis. In fact, the proof of the theorem crucially relies on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hahn%E2%80%93Banach_theorem">Hahn&ndash;Banach Theorem</a>.</p>
<p>The mild technical mentioned in the Rate Theorem is that the ordered commutative monoid needs to have a <b>generating pair</b>. This turns out to hold in the applications that I have considered so far, and I hope that it will turn out to hold in most others as well. For the full gory details, see <a href="http://perimeterinstitute.ca/personal/tfritz/ordered_commutative_monoids.pdf">the paper</a>.</p>
<p>So this provides some idea of what kinds of gadgets one can find in the toolbox of ordered commutative monoids. Next time, I&#8217;ll show some applications to graph theory and zero-error communication and say a bit about where this project might be going next.</p>

					<p><i>guest post by <b><a href="http://perimeterinstitute.ca/personal/tfritz/">Tobias Fritz</a></b></i></p>
<p>Hi! I am Tobias Fritz, a mathematician at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Canada. I like to work on all sorts of mathematical structures which pop up in probability theory, information theory, and other sorts of applied math. Today I would like to tell you about my latest paper:</p>
<p>&bull;  <a href="http://perimeterinstitute.ca/personal/tfritz/ordered_commutative_monoids.pdf">The mathematical structure of theories of resource convertibility, I</a>.</p>
<p>It should be of interest to Azimuth readers as it forms part of what John likes to call <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2013/02/15/prospects-for-a-green-mathematics/">&#8216;green mathematics&#8217;</a>. So let&#8217;s get started!</p>
<p>Resources and their management are an essential part of our everyday life. We deal with the management of time or money pretty much every day. We also consume natural resources in order to afford food and amenities for (some of) the 7 billion people on our planet. Many of the objects that we deal with in science and engineering can be considered as resources. For example, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_%28communications%29">communication channel</a> is a resource for sending information from one party to another. But for now, let&#8217;s stick with a toy example: timber and nails constitute a resource for making a table. In mathematical notation, this looks like so:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7Btimber%7D+%2B+%5Cmathrm%7Bnails%7D+%5Cgeq+%5Cmathrm%7Btable%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{timber} + &#92;mathrm{nails} &#92;geq &#92;mathrm{table}" class="latex" /></p>
<p>We interpret this inequality as saying that &#8220;given timber and nails, we can make a table&#8221;. I like to write it as an inequality like this, which I think of as stating that having timber and nails is at least as good as having a table, because the timber and nails can always be turned into a table whenever one needs a table.</p>
<p>To be more precise, we should also take into account that making the table requires some tools. These tools do not get consumed in the process, so we also get them back out:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctext%7Btimber%7D+%2B+%5Ctext%7Bnails%7D+%2B+%5Ctext%7Bsaw%7D+%2B+%5Ctext%7Bhammer%7D+%5Cgeq+%5Ctext%7Btable%7D+%2B+%5Ctext%7Bhammer%7D+%2B+%5Ctext%7Bsaw%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;text{timber} + &#92;text{nails} + &#92;text{saw} + &#92;text{hammer} &#92;geq &#92;text{table} + &#92;text{hammer} + &#92;text{saw}" class="latex" /></p>
<p>Notice that this kind of equation is analogous to a chemical reaction equation like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2+%5Cmathrm%7BH%7D_2+%2B+%5Cmathrm%7BO%7D_2+%5Cgeq+%5Cmathrm%7BH%7D_2%5Cmathrm%7BO%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="2 &#92;mathrm{H}_2 + &#92;mathrm{O}_2 &#92;geq &#92;mathrm{H}_2&#92;mathrm{O} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>So given a hydrogen molecules and an oxygen molecule, we can let them react such as to form a molecule of water. In chemistry, this kind of equation would usually be written with an arrow &#8216;<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crightarrow&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;rightarrow" class="latex" />’  instead of an ordering symbol &#8216;<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgeq&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;geq" class="latex" />’ , but here we interpret the equation slightly differently. As with the timber and the nails and nails above, the inequality says that if we have two hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom, then we <i>can</i> let them react to a molecule of water, but we don&#8217;t <i>have</i> to. In this sense, having two hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom is at least as good as having a molecule of water.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s going on here, mathematically? In all of the above equations, we have a bunch of stuff on each side and an inequality &#8216;<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgeq&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;geq" class="latex" />’  in between. The stuff on each side consists of a bunch of objects tacked together via &#8216;<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%2B&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="+" class="latex" />’ . With respect to these two pieces of structure, the collection of all our resource objects forms an <i>ordered commutative monoid</i>:</p>
<p><b>Definition</b>: An ordered commutative monoid is a set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> equipped with a binary relation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgeq%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;geq," class="latex" /> a binary operation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%2B%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="+," class="latex" /> and a distinguished element <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="0" class="latex" /> such that the following hold:</p>
<p>&bull; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%2B&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="+" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="0" class="latex" /> equip <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> with the structure of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoid#Commutative_monoid">commutative monoid</a>;</p>
<p>&bull; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgeq&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;geq" class="latex" /> equips <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> with the structure of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set">partially ordered set</a>;</p>
<p>&bull; addition is monotone: if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5Cgeq+y%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x&#92;geq y," class="latex" /> then also <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%2B+z+%5Cgeq+y+%2B+z.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x + z &#92;geq y + z." class="latex" /></p>
<p>Here, the third axiom is the most important, since it tells us how the additive structure interacts with the ordering structure.</p>
<p>Ordered commutative monoids are the mathematical formalization of resource convertibility and combinability as follows. The elements <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2Cy%5Cin+A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x,y&#92;in A" class="latex" /> are the resource objects, corresponding to the &#8216;collections of stuff&#8217; in our earlier examples, such as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%3D+%5Ctext%7Btimber%7D+%2B+%5Ctext%7Bnails%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x = &#92;text{timber} + &#92;text{nails}" class="latex" /> or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y+%3D+2+%5Ctext%7BH%7D_2+%2B+%5Ctext%7BO%7D_2.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y = 2 &#92;text{H}_2 + &#92;text{O}_2." class="latex" /> Then the addition operation simply joins up collections of stuff into bigger collections of stuff. The ordering relation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgeq&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;geq" class="latex" /> is what formalizes resource convertibility, as in the examples above. The third axiom states that if we can convert <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> into <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y," class="latex" /> then we can also convert <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> together with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="z" class="latex" /> into <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y" class="latex" /> together with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="z" class="latex" /> for any <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="z," class="latex" /> for example by doing nothing to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="z." class="latex" /></p>
<p>A mathematically minded reader might object that requiring <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> to form a partially ordered set under <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgeq&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;geq" class="latex" /> is too strong a requirement, since it requires two resource objects to be equal as soon as they are mutually interconvertible: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%5Cgeq+y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x &#92;geq y" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y+%5Cgeq+x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y &#92;geq x" class="latex" /> implies <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%3D+y.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x = y." class="latex" /> However, I think that this is not an essential restriction, because we can regard this implication as the <i>definition</i> of equality: &#8216;<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%3D+y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x = y" class="latex" />’ is just a shorthand notation for &#8216;<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5Cgeq+y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x&#92;geq y" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%5Cgeq+x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y&#92;geq x" class="latex" />’ which formalizes the perfect interconvertibility of resource objects.</p>
<p>We could now go back to the original examples and try to model carpentry and chemistry in terms of ordered commutative monoids. But as a mathematician, I needed to start out with something mathematically precise and rigorous as a testing ground for the formalism. This helps ensure that the mathematics is sensible and useful before diving into real-world applications. So, the main example in my paper is the ordered commutative monoid of graphs, which has a resource-theoretic interpretation in terms of <a href="http://alon.ucsd.edu/papers/zer_err_it.ps">zero-error information theory</a>. As graph theory is a difficult and traditional subject, this application constitutes the perfect training camp for the mathematics of ordered commutative monoids. I will get to this in Part 3.</p>
<p>In Part 2, I will say something about what one can do with ordered commutative monoids. In the meantime, I&#8217;d be curious to know what you think about what I&#8217;ve said so far!</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>For those who have been following the posts on <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/networks_17.html">reaction networks</a>, this workshop should be interesting!  I hope to see you there.</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.math.ku.dk/~efeliu/trendsrnt/index.html">Workshop on Mathematical Trends in Reaction Network Theory</a>, 1-3 July 2015, Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of Copenhagen.  Organized by <a href="http://www.math.ku.dk/~efeliu/">Elisenda Feliu</a> and <a href="http://www.math.ku.dk/~pbx512/">Carsten Wiuf</a>.</p>
<h3>Description </h3>
<p>This workshop focuses on current and new trends in mathematical reaction network theory, which we consider broadly to be the theory describing the behaviour of systems of (bio)chemical reactions. In recent years, new interesting approaches using theory from dynamical systems, stochastics, algebra and beyond, have appeared. We aim to provide a forum for discussion of these new approaches and to bring together researchers from different communities.</p>
<h3>Structure</h3>
<p>The workshop starts in the morning of Wednesday, July 1st, and finishes at lunchtime on Friday, July 3rd. In the morning there will be invited talks, followed by contributed talks in the afternoon. There will be a reception and poster session Wednesday in the afternoon, and a conference dinner Thursday. For those participants staying Friday afternoon, a sightseeing event will be arranged.</p>
<h3>Organization</h3>
<p>The workshop is organized by the research group on <a href="http://www.math.ku.dk/english/research/reaction-networks/">Mathematics of Reaction Networks</a> at the Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of Copenhagen. The event is sponsored by the Danish Research Council, the Department of Mathematical Sciences and the <a href="http://dsin.ku.dk/">Dynamical Systems Interdisciplinary Network</a>, which is part of the UCPH Excellence Programme for Interdisciplinary Research.</p>

<p>They&#8217;ve written some interesting papers on reaction networks, including some that discuss chemical reactions with <i>more than one stationary state</i>.  This is a highly nonlinear regime that&#8217;s very important in biology:</p>
<p>&bull; Elisenda Feliu and Carsten Wiuf, <a href="http://www.math.ku.dk/~pbx512/journalWiuf/bioinformatics29.pdf">A computational method to preclude multistationarity in networks of interacting species</a>, <i>Bioinformatics</i> <b>29</b> (2013), 2327-2334.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<b>Motivation.</b> Modeling and analysis of complex systems are important aspects of understanding systemic behavior. In the lack of detailed knowledge about a system, we often choose modeling equations out of convenience and search the (high-dimensional) parameter space randomly to learn about model properties. Qualitative modeling sidesteps the issue of choosing specific modeling equations and frees the inference from specific properties of the equations. We consider classes of ordinary differential equation (ODE) models arising from interactions of species/entities, such as (bio)chemical reaction networks or ecosystems. A class is defined by imposing mild assumptions on the interaction rates. In this framework, we investigate whether there can be multiple positive steady states in some ODE models in a given class.</p>
<p><b>Results.</b> We have developed and implemented a method to decide whether any ODE model in a given class cannot have multiple steady states. The method runs efficiently on models of moderate size. We tested the method on a large set of models for gene silencing by sRNA interference and on two publicly available databases of biological models, KEGG and Biomodels. We recommend that this method is used as (i) a pre-screening step for selecting an appropriate model and (ii) for investigating the robustness of non-existence of multiple steady state for a given ODE model with respect to variation in interaction rates.</p>
<p><b>Availability and Implementation.</b> Scripts and examples in Maple are available in the Supplementary Information.

<blockquote><p>
<b>Abstract.</b> Polynomial dynamical systems are widely used to model and study real phenomena. In biochemistry, they are the preferred choice for modelling the concentration of chemical species in reaction networks with mass-action kinetics. These systems are typically parameterised by many (unknown) parameters. A goal is to understand how properties of the dynamical systems depend on the parameters. Qualitative properties relating to the behaviour of a dynamical system are locally inferred from the system at steady state. Here we focus on steady states that are the positive solutions to a parameterised system of generalised polynomial equations. In recent years, methods from computational algebra have been developed to understand these solutions, but our knowledge is limited: for example, we cannot efficiently decide how many positive solutions the system has as a function of the parameters. Even deciding whether there is one or more solutions is non-trivial. We present a new method, based on so-called injectivity, to preclude or assert that multiple positive solutions exist. The results apply to generalised polynomials and variables can be restricted to the linear, parameter-independent first integrals of the dynamical system. The method has been tested in a wide range of systems.

<p>The first two are about ways one chemical reaction network can simulate another.  This is important for a couple of reasons.  First, in biology, a bunch of different chemical reactions can &#8216;accomplish the same task&#8217;&#8212;and we&#8217;d like to make this idea precise.  That&#8217;s what Luca Cardelli spoke about.  Second, people trying to do computation with chemistry are starting to simulate quite general reactions using DNA!  That&#8217;s what Sheung Woo Shin spoke about.</p>
<h3> Luca Cardelli </h3>
<p><a href="http://lucacardelli.name/">Luca Cardelli</a> was at Oxford when I was visiting this spring, but unfortunately I didn&#8217;t meet him!  He works for Microsoft on the interface of biology and computation.  At Banff, he talked about ways one chemical reaction network can simulate another.  His slides are here:</p>

<p>He has a paper that gives a more detailed explanation of these ideas:</p>

<p>Here is my own disorganized explanation&#8230; with lots of informative but confusing digressions.  A <b>population protocol</b> is a chemical reaction with only 2-in, 2-out reactions. For example, this paper presents a population protocol that does &#8216;approximate majority detection&#8217;:</p>
<p>&bull; Dana Angluin, James Aspnes, and David Eisenstat, <a href="http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/aspnes/papers/approximate-majority-abstract.html">A simple population protocol for fast robust approximate majority</a>, <i>Distributed Computing</i> <b>21</b> (2008), 87–102. </p>
<p>What&#8217;s the idea?  We start with two kinds of molecules, say <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" />’s and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y" class="latex" />’s, and we want to see which one is in the majority, so we run these chemical reactions:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%2B+y+%5Cto+x+%2B+b&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x + y &#92;to x + b" class="latex" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%2B+y+%5Cto+y+%2B+b&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x + y &#92;to y + b" class="latex" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%2B+b+%5Cto+2x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x + b &#92;to 2x" class="latex" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y+%2B+b+%5Cto+2y+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y + b &#92;to 2y " class="latex" /></p>
<p>See?  All the reactions have 2 molecules going in and 2 going out. The <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="b" class="latex" /> molecules act as &#8216;undecided voters&#8217; who become either an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> or a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y," class="latex" /> depending on who they meet first.  </p>
<p>If we start with about <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" /> molecules, in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28n+%5Clog+n%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O(n &#92;log n)" class="latex" /> time these reactions are very likely to convert all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" />’s and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y" class="latex" />’s to whatever kind of molecule was in the <i>majority</i> initially&#8230; at least if the gap in the number of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" />’s and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y" class="latex" />’s is big enough.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another population protocol that also does the job:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%2B+y+%5Cto+2b+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x + y &#92;to 2b " class="latex" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%2B+b+%5Cto+2x+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x + b &#92;to 2x " class="latex" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y+%2B+b+%5Cto+2y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y + b &#92;to 2y" class="latex" /></p>
<p>And here&#8217;s a proof that one of these algorithms actually works&#8212;most of the time, when the initial difference in populations is big enough:</p>
<p>&bull; Etienne Perron, Dinkar Vasudevan, and Milan Vojonvic, <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/78881/tr-2008-114.pdf">Using three states for binary consensus on complete graphs</a>, Technical Report, MSR-TR-2008-114, Microsoft, September 2008.</p>
<p>If we use a discrete-time formalism to describe the dynamics, the proof seems to get harder.  See the paper by Angluin, Aspnes, and Eisenstat for the only known proof!  </p>
<p>Anyway, Luca Cardelli is interested in chemical reaction networks actually found in biology.  This approximate majority algorithm is seen quite clearly in a certain biological system: a certain &#8216;epigenetic switch&#8217;.  However, it is usually &#8216;obfuscated&#8217; or &#8216;encrypted&#8217;: hidden in a bigger, more complicated chemical reaction network.  For example, see:</p>
<p>&bull; Luca Cardelli and Attila Csikász-Nagy, <a href="http://www.nature.com/srep/2012/120913/srep00656/full/srep00656.html">The cell cycle switch is approximate majority obfuscated</a>, <i>Scientific Reports</i> <b>2</b> (2012).</p>
<p>This got him interested in developing a theory of morphisms between reaction networks, which could answer questions like: When can one CRN emulate another?  But these questions turn out to be much easier if we use the <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/09/09/network-theory-part-8/">rate equation</a> than with the master equation.  So, he asks: when can one CRN give the same rate equation as another?   </p>
<p>He found a sufficient condition that&#8217;s &#8216;purely syntactic&#8217;: you can tell if it holds by looking at the reaction networks, regardless of the rate constants.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the idea.  We say one network <b>emulates</b> another if for any rate constants of the second, we can find rate constants for the first that makes its rate equation have solutions exactly mimicking that of the second, but where several species in the first correspond to one in the second.  </p>
<p>For this to make sense, we assume there is a map sending:</p>
<p>&bull; species to species<br />
&bull; reactions to reactions</p>
<p>In a <b>chemical reaction network homomorphism</b>, the map on reactions is determined by the map on species in the obvious way.  For example, if species <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> is sent to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28A%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f(A)" class="latex" /> and species <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B" class="latex" /> is sent to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28B%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f(B)" class="latex" /> then the reaction</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2A+%2B+B+%5Cto+3B+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="2A + B &#92;to 3B " class="latex" /></p>
<p>is sent to the reaction </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2f%28A%29+%2B+f%28B%29+%5Cto+3+f%28B%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="2f(A) + f(B) &#92;to 3 f(B)" class="latex" /></p>
<p>In this situation, to make the first network emulate the second, we need to set equal the initial concentrations of all species in the inverse image of a given species.</p>
<p>A <b>reactant homomorphism</b> from one chemical reaction network to another is more general: it sends species to species, and for any reaction in the first chemical reaction network with input </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+%2B+B+%2B+C+%5Ccdots&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A + B + C &#92;cdots" class="latex" /> </p>
<p>there&#8217;s a reaction in the second with input </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28A%29+%2B+f%28B%29+%2B+f%28C%29+%2B+%5Ccdots+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f(A) + f(B) + f(C) + &#92;cdots " class="latex" />  </p>
<p>(<b>Reactant</b> is another name for input.)</p>
<p>A <b>stoichiomorphism</b> is a kind of morphism that takes rate constants into account. See Cardelli&#8217;s paper for the definition.</p>
<p>The main theorem: given a stoichiomorphism from one chemical reaction network to another that&#8217;s also a reactant homomorphism, then the first emulates the second.</p>
<p>For a better explanation, read <a href="http://lucacardelli.name/Papers/CRN%20Morphisms%20%28draft%29.pdf">his paper</a>!  Here&#8217;s a cool picture from his paper showing a bunch of chemical reaction networks including the approximate majority network (labelled <b>AM</b>), many of which show up in biology, and morphisms between them:</p>
<p><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/cardelli_network_morphisms.jpg"><br />
<img width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/cardelli_network_morphisms.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>Click to enlarge!  These chemical reaction networks are drawn in a special style: as <b>influence networks</b>, consisting of &#8216;gates&#8217; where process activates or deactivates another.  Each gate is a chemical reaction network of a certain form, schematically like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7Boff%7D+%5Cleftrightarrow+%5Cmathrm%7Bintermediate%7D+%5Cleftrightarrow+%5Cmathrm%7Bon%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{off} &#92;leftrightarrow &#92;mathrm{intermediate} &#92;leftrightarrow &#92;mathrm{on}" class="latex" /> </p>
<p>where the forward reactions are catalyzed by one chemical and the reverse reactions are catalyzed by another.  A gate is like a switch that can be turned on or off.</p>
<p>While listening to this talk, I thought the way in which one CRN emulates another in Cardelli&#8217;s formalism looks awfully similar to the way one dynamical system emulates another in Eugene Lerman&#8217;s formalism:</p>

<p>The following picture from Cardelli&#8217;s paper shows that one of his morphisms of reaction networks is like &#8216;covering map&#8217;.  This reminds me a lot of what&#8217;s happening in Lerman&#8217;s work.</p>

<h3> Seung Woo Shin </h3>
<p>Seung Woo Shin was actually Brendan Fong&#8217;s roommate at the National University of Singapore while Brendan was working with me on chemical reaction networks.  Apparently they never talked about their work!  </p>
<p>Shin spoke about some other concepts of &#8216;morphism&#8217; between chemical reaction networks.  These other concepts do not involve reaction rates, just which chemicals can turn into which.  You can see his slides here:</p>
<p>&bull; Seung Woo Shin, <a href="http://crn.thachuk.com/images/a/a1/Shin_Banff_June2014.pdf">Verifying CRN implementations</a>.</p>
<p>and read his thesis for more details:</p>
<p>&bull; Seung Woo Shin, <a href="http://thesis.library.caltech.edu/6676/">Compiling and verifying DNA-based chemical reaction network implementations</a>, Masters thesis, Caltech, 2012.</p>
<blockquote><p> <b>Abstract:</b> One goal of molecular programming and synthetic biology is to build chemical circuits that can control chemical processes at the molecular level. Remarkably, it has been shown that synthesized DNA molecules can be used to construct complex chemical circuits that operate without any enzyme or cellular component. However, designing DNA molecules at the individual nucleotide base level is often difficult and laborious, and thus chemical reaction networks (CRNs) have been proposed as a higher-level programming language. So far, several general-purpose schemes have been described for designing synthetic DNA molecules that simulate the behavior of arbitrary CRNs, and many more are being actively investigated.</p>
<p>Here, we solve two problems related to this topic. First, we present a general-purpose CRN-to-DNA compiler that can apply user-defined compilation schemes for translating formal CRNs to domain-level specifications for DNA molecules. In doing so, we develop a language in which such schemes can be concisely and precisely described. This compiler can greatly reduce the amount of tedious manual labor faced by researchers working in the field. Second, we present a general method for the formal verification of the correctness of such compilation. We first show that this problem reduces to testing a notion of behavioral equivalence between two CRNs, and then we construct a mathematical formalism in which that notion can be precisely defined. Finally, we provide algorithms for testing that notion. This verification process can be thought of as an equivalent of model checking in molecular computation, and we hope that the generality of our verification techniques will eventually allow us to apply them not only to DNA-based CRN implementations but to a wider class of molecular programs.

<p>I think this work is fascinating and deeply related to category theory, so I talked to Shin and Winfree about it, and this is what we came up with:</p>

<h3> David Anderson </h3>
<p>Brendan Fong and I wrote about David Anderson&#8217;s work in <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/networks_9.html">Part 9</a> of the network theory series.  It&#8217;s so impressive that I expected him to be older&#8230; older than me, I guess.  He&#8217;s not!</p>
<p>In his tutorial, he gave an overview of chemical reaction networks with an emphasis on the deficiency zero theorem.  Since many people were puzzled by the &#8216;deficiency&#8217; concept, they asked lots of questions.  But I&#8217;ve already explained that idea in <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/networks_21.html">Part 21</a>.  So, I&#8217;ll just mention a couple of cool theorems he told us about!</p>
<p><b>Theorem (Horn and Jackson).</b>  If a reaction network has a complex balanced equilibrium, then:</p>
<p>1. It has no equilibria that are not complex balanced.</p>
<p>2. The reaction network must be weakly reversible.</p>
<p>3.  Every stochiometric compatibility class contains precisely one complex balanced equilibrium.</p>
<p>I should have known this, since this work is classic.  But I don&#8217;t think I knew that the existence of <i>one</i> complex balanced equilibrium implied all this stuff!</p>
<p>He also mentioned this paper:</p>
<p>&bull; Guy Shinar and Martin Feinberg, Structural sources of robustness in biochemical reaction networks, <i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/327/5971/1389.full">Science</a></i> (2010).</p>
<p>which contains this amazing theorem:</p>
<p><b>Theorem (Shinar and Feinberg).</b>  Suppose there is a chemical reaction network such that: </p>
<p>1.  its deficiency equals one;</p>
<p>2.  it has a positive steady state;</p>
<p>3.  it has two &#8220;non-terminal complexes&#8221; that differ only in one species <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S." class="latex" />  (&#8220;Non-terminal&#8221; is a concept that&#8217;s easier to explain with a picture of a reaction network).</p>
<p>Then the species <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S" class="latex" /> is <b>absolutely robust</b>: with any initial conditions, the rate equation will approach an equilibrium where the concentration of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S" class="latex" /> approaches a specific fixed value <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c," class="latex" /> independent of the initial conditions!</p>
<p>However, things work very differently if we treat the system stochastically, using the master equation:</p>

<h3> More </h3>
<p>A lot more happened at this workshop!  There was a huge amount of discussion of the leader election problem, which is about how to cook up chemical reactions that create a &#8216;leader&#8217;: a single molecule of some sort.  </p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://crn.thachuk.com/index.php/Open_Problems#Leader_election">Leader election</a>: the problem, and references.</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://crn.thachuk.com/index.php/Leader_election">Leader election</a>: progress report.</p>
<p>As I explained before, David Soloveichik talked about various forms of <i>digital</i> computation with chemical reaction networks.  David Doty talked about the very important flip side of the coin: <i>analog</i> computation.</p>
<p>&bull; David Doty, <a href="http://www.dna.caltech.edu/~ddoty/papers/riccrn-talk.pdf">Rate-independent computation by real-valued chemistry</a>.</p>
<p>There were also great talks by Lulu Qian and Erik Winfree, which I won&#8217;t try to summarize.  Qian does a lot of work in the lab making things actually happen, so if you&#8217;re a practical sort this is the talk to look at:</p>
<p>&bull; Lulu Qian, <a href="http://crn.thachuk.com/images/4/45/Qian_Banff_June2014.pdf">Implementing complex CRNs with modular DNA components</a>.</p>
<p>All in all, a very stimulating workshop.  The diversity of things one can ask about chemical reaction networks is quite exciting!  </p>

David did his graduate work with Erik Winfree at Caltech, focusing on algorithmic self-assembly and on synthetic networks of nucleic-acid interactions based on strand displacement cascades. He is interested in &#8220;molecular programming&#8221;: the systematic design of complex molecular systems based on the principles of computer science and distributed computing. More generally, he is trying to create a theoretical foundation of chemical computation applicable to both synthetic and natural systems.
</p></blockquote>
<p>According to <a href="http://solo.ucsf.edu/">his webpage</a>, Soloveichik&#8217;s research interests are:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<b>Wet-lab:</b> the rational design of molecular interactions for synthetic biology, nanotechnology, and bioengineering.  The goal is to engineer autonomous molecular systems that can sense, compute, and perform various actions. Using nucleic-acid &#8220;strand displacement cascades&#8221; as the molecular primitive, we are able to attain freedom of design that hasn&#8217;t been previously possible.</p>
<p><b>Theory:</b> The theoretical foundation of chemical computation.  Once we have a way to program molecular interactions, what programming language shall we use? How molecules can process information and carry out computation is still not well-understood; however, a formal connection to models of concurrent computation may allow systematic and scalable design, rigorous analysis and verification. Further, computational principles may elucidate the design of biological regulatory networks.

<p>Here are my notes on his tutorial.</p>
<h3> Motivation </h3>
<p>We&#8217;ve got people here from different backgrounds: </p>
<p>&bull; computational complexity theory<br />
&bull; wetlab / experimental science<br />
&bull; pure and applied mathematics<br />
&bull; software verification</p>
<p>CRNs (chemical reaction networks) show up in:</p>
<p>&bull; chemistry<br />
&bull; population biology<br />
&bull; sensor networks<br />
&bull; math:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#9675; vector addition systems<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#9675; Petri nets<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#9675; commutative semigroups<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#9675; bounded context-free languages<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#9675; uniform recurrence equations</p>
<p>Why use them for computation?  People want to go beyond the von Neumann architecture for computation.  People also want to understand how cells process information.  However, with a few exceptions, the computational perspective in this talk has not yet proved relevant in biology.  So, there is a lot left to learn.</p>
<h3> The model </h3>
<p>The model of computation here will be the master equation for a chemical reaction network&#8230; since this has been explained starting <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/networks_4.html">Part 4</a> of the network theory series, I won&#8217;t review it!</p>
<p>Can all chemical reaction networks, even those without any conservation laws, be realized by actual chemical systems?</p>
<p>Though this is a subtle question, one answer is &#8220;yes, using strand displacement cascades&#8221;.  This is a trick for getting DNA to simulate other chemical reactions.  It&#8217;s been carried out in the lab!  See this paper and many subsequent ones:</p>
<p>&bull; Soloveichik, Seelig and Winfree, <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/107/12/5393.full">DNA as a universal substrate for chemical kinetics</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<b>Abstract:</b> Molecular programming aims to systematically engineer molecular and chemical systems of autonomous function and ever-increasing complexity. A key goal is to develop embedded control circuitry within a chemical system to direct molecular events. Here we show that systems of DNA molecules can be constructed that closely approximate the dynamic behavior of arbitrary systems of coupled chemical reactions. By using strand displacement reactions as a primitive, we construct reaction cascades with effectively unimolecular and bimolecular kinetics. Our construction allows individual reactions to be coupled in arbitrary ways such that reactants can participate in multiple reactions simultaneously, reproducing the desired dynamical properties. Thus arbitrary systems of chemical equations can be compiled into real chemical systems. We illustrate our method on the Lotka–Volterra oscillator, a limit-cycle oscillator, a chaotic system, and systems implementing feedback digital logic and algorithmic behavior.
</p></blockquote>
<p>However, even working with the master equation for a CRN, there are various things we might mean by having it compute something:</p>
<p>&bull; uniform vs non-uniform: is a single CRN supposed to handle all inputs, or do we allow adding extra reactions for larger inputs?  It&#8217;s a bit like Turing machines vs Boolean circuits.</p>
<p>&bull; deterministic vs probabilistic: is the correct output guaranteed or merely likely?</p>
<p>&bull; halting vs stabilizing: does the CRN &#8216;know&#8217; when it has finished, or not?  In the &#8216;halting&#8217; case the CRN irreversibly produces some molecules that signal that the computation is done.  In the &#8216;stabilizing&#8217; case, it eventually stabilizes to the right answer, but we may not know how long to wait.</p>
<p>These distinctions dramatically affect the computational power.  In the case of uniform computation:</p>
<p>&bull; deterministic and halting: this has finite computational power.  </p>
<p>&bull; deterministic and stabilizing: this can decide semilinear predicates.</p>
<p>&bull; probabilistic and halting: this is Turing-universal.</p>
<p>&bull; probabilistic and stabilizing: this can decide <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CDelta_2%5E0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;Delta_2^0" class="latex" /> predicates, which are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borel_hierarchy#Lightface_hierarchy">more general than computable ones</a>.  (Indeed, if we use Turing machines but don&#8217;t require them to signal when they&#8217;ve halted, the resulting infinitely long computations can &#8216;compute&#8217; stuff that&#8217;s not computable in the usual sense.)</p>
<h3> Deterministic stabilizing computations </h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at the deterministic stabilizing computations in a bit more detail.  We&#8217;ll look at decision problems.  We have a subset <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S+%5Csubseteq+%5Cmathbb%7BN%7D%5Ed%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S &#92;subseteq &#92;mathbb{N}^d," class="latex" /> and we want to answer this question: is the vector <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BN%7D%5Ed&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X &#92;in &#92;mathbb{N}^d" class="latex" /> in the set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%3F&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S?" class="latex" /></p>
<p>To do this, we represent the vector as a bunch of molecules: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X_1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X_1" class="latex" /> of the first kind, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X_2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X_2" class="latex" /> of the second kind, and so on.  We call this an <b>input</b>.  We may also include a fixed collection of additional molecules in our input, to help the reactions run.</p>
<p>Then we choose a chemical reaction network, and we let it run on our input.  The answer to our question will be encoded in some molecules called Y and N.  If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> is in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S," class="latex" /> we want our chemical reaction to produce Y molecules.  If it&#8217;s not, we want our reaction to produce N&#8217;s.</p>
<p>To make this more precise, we need to define what counts as an <b>output</b>.  If we&#8217;ve got a bunch of molecules that</p>
<p>&bull; contains Y but not N: then the output is YES.</p>
<p>&bull; contains N but not Y: then the output is NO.</p>
<p>Otherwise the output is undefined.</p>
<p><b>Output-stable states</b> are states with YES or NO output such that all states reachable from them via our chemical reactions give the same output.  We say an output-stable-state is <b>correct</b> if this output is the correct answer to the question: is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>Our chemical reaction network gives a <b>deterministic stabilizing computation</b> if for any input, and choosing any state reachable from that input, we can do further chemical reactions to reach a correct output-stable state.</p>
<p>In other words: starting from our input, and letting the chemical reactions &lt;run <i>any way they want</i>, we will eventually stabilize at an output that gives the right answer to the question &#8220;is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S" class="latex" />?&#8221;</p>
<h3> Examples </h3>
<p>This sounds a bit complicated, but it&#8217;s really not.   Let&#8217;s look at some examples!</p>
<p><b>Example 1.</b> Suppose you want to check two numbers and see if one is greater than or equal to another.  Here </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S+%3D+%5C%7B%28X_1%2CX_2%29+%3A+X_2+%5Cge+X_1+%5C%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S = &#92;{(X_1,X_2) : X_2 &#92;ge X_1 &#92;}" class="latex" /></p>
<p>How can you decide if a pair of numbers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28X_1%2CX_2%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(X_1,X_2)" class="latex" /> is in this set? </p>
<p>You start with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X_1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X_1" class="latex" /> molecules of type <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A," class="latex" /> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X_2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X_2" class="latex" /> molecules of type <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B," class="latex" /> and one molecule of type <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Y" class="latex" />.  Then you use a chemical reaction network with these reactions:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+%2B+N+%5Cto+Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A + N &#92;to Y" class="latex" /><br />

<p>If you let these reactions run, the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Y" class="latex" /> switches to a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="N" class="latex" /> each time the reactions destroy an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" />.  But the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="N" class="latex" /> switches back to a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Y" class="latex" /> each time the reactions destroy a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B." class="latex" /></p>
<p>When no more reactions are possible, we are left with either one <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Y" class="latex" /> or one <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="N" class="latex" />, which is the correct answer to your question!</p>
<p><b>Example 2.</b> Suppose you want to check two numbers and see if one is equal to another. Here </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S+%3D+%5C%7B%28X_1%2CX_2%29+%3A+X_2+%3D+X_1+%5C%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S = &#92;{(X_1,X_2) : X_2 = X_1 &#92;}" class="latex" /></p>

<p>This is a bit harder!  As before, you start with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X_1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X_1" class="latex" /> molecules of type <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A," class="latex" /> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X_2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X_2" class="latex" /> molecules of type <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B," class="latex" /> and one molecule of type <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Y." class="latex" />  Then you use a chemical reaction network with these reactions:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+%2B+B+%5Cto+Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A + B &#92;to Y" class="latex" /><br />

<p>The first reaction lets an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> and a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B" class="latex" /> cancel out, producing a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Y" class="latex" />. If you only run this reaction, you&#8217;ll eventually be left with either a bunch of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%5Cmathrm%7Bs%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A&#92;mathrm{s}" class="latex" /> or a bunch of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B%5Cmathrm%7Bs%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B&#92;mathrm{s}" class="latex" /> or nothing but <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y%5Cmathrm%7Bs%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Y&#92;mathrm{s}" class="latex" />.  </p>
<p>If you have <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y%5Cmathrm%7Bs%7D%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Y&#92;mathrm{s}," class="latex" /> your numbers were equal.  The other reactions deal with the cases where you have <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%5Cmathrm%7Bs%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A&#92;mathrm{s}" class="latex" /> or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B%5Cmathrm%7Bs%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B&#92;mathrm{s}" class="latex" /> left over. But the key thing to check is that <i>no matter what order we run the reactions, we&#8217;ll eventually get the right answer!</i>  In the end, you&#8217;ll have either <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y%5Cmathrm%7Bs%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Y&#92;mathrm{s}" class="latex" /> or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N%5Cmathrm%7Bs%7D%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="N&#92;mathrm{s}," class="latex" /> not both, and this will provide the yes-or-no answer to the question of whether <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X_1+%3D+X_2.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X_1 = X_2." class="latex" /></p>
<h3> What deterministic stabilizing computations can do </h3>
<p>We&#8217;ve looked at some examples of deterministic stabilizing computations.  The big question is: what kind of questions can they answer?</p>
<p>More precisely, for what subsets <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+%5Csubseteq+%5Cmathbb%7BN%7D%5Ed&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A &#92;subseteq &#92;mathbb{N}^d" class="latex" /> can we build a deterministic stabilizing computation that ends with output YES if the input <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> lies in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> and with output NO otherwise?  </p>
<p>The answer is: the &#8216;semilinear&#8217; subsets!</p>
<p>&bull; Dana Angluin, James Aspnes and David Eistenstat, <a href="http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/aspnes/papers/podc2006-proceedings.pdf">Stably computable predicates are semilinear</a>.</p>
<p>A set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S+%5Csubseteq+%5Cmathbb%7BN%7D%5Ed&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S &#92;subseteq &#92;mathbb{N}^d" class="latex" /> is <b>linear</b> if it&#8217;s of the form</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7Bu_0+%2B+n_1+u_1+%2B+%5Ccdots+%2B+n_p+u_p+%3A+n_i+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BN%7D++%5C%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;{u_0 + n_1 u_1 + &#92;cdots + n_p u_p : n_i &#92;in &#92;mathbb{N}  &#92;} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>for some fixed vectors of natural numbers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u_i+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BN%7D%5Ed.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="u_i &#92;in &#92;mathbb{N}^d." class="latex" /></p>
<p>A set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S+%5Csubseteq+%5Cmathbb%7BN%7D%5Ed&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S &#92;subseteq &#92;mathbb{N}^d" class="latex" /> <b>semilinear</b> if it&#8217;s a finite union of linear sets.</p>
<p>How did Angluin, Aspnes and Eisenstat prove their theorem?  Apparently the easy part is showing that membership in any semilinear set can be decided by a chemical reaction network.  David sketched the proof of the converse.  I won&#8217;t go into it, but it used a very nice fact:</p>
<p><b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dickson%27s_lemma">Dickson&#8217;s Lemma</a></b>. Any subset of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BN%7D%5Ed&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{N}^d" class="latex" /> has a finite set of minimal elements, where we define <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%5Cle+y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x &#92;le y" class="latex" /> if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_i+%5Cle+y_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x_i &#92;le y_i" class="latex" /> for all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>For example, the region above and to the right of the hyperbola here has five minimal elements:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dickson%27s_lemma"><img width="400" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Dickson_hyperbola9.svg/500px-Dickson_hyperbola9.svg.png" /></a></p>
<p>If you know some algebra, Dickson&#8217;s lemma should remind you of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_basis_theorem">Hilbert basis theorem</a>, saying (for example) that every ideal in a ring of multivariable polynomials over a field is finitely generated.  And in fact, Paul Gordan used Dickson&#8217;s Lemma in 1899 to help give a proof of Hilbert&#8217;s basis theorem.  </p>
<p>It&#8217;s very neat to see how this lemma applies to chemical reaction networks!  You can see how it works in <a href="http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/aspnes/papers/podc2006-proceedings.pdf">Angluin, Aspnes and Eistenstat&#8217;s paper</a>. But they call it &#8220;Higman&#8217;s lemma&#8221; for some reason.</p>

<h3> Description </h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s the workshop proposal on the BIRS website.  It&#8217;s a pretty interesting proposal, especially if you&#8217;ve already read <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/networks_26.html">Luca Cardelli&#8217;s description</a> of computing with chemical reaction networks, at the end of our <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/">series of posts</a> on chemical reaction networks.   The references include a lot of cool papers, so I&#8217;ve created links to those to help you get ahold of them.</p>
<blockquote><p>
This workshop will explore three of the most important research themes concerning stochastic chemical reaction networks (CRNs). Below we motivate each theme and highlight key questions that the workshop will address. Our main objective is to bring together distinct research communities in order to consider new problems that could not be fully appreciated in isolation. It is also our aim to determine commonalities between different disciplines and bodies of research. For example, research into population protocols, vector addition systems, and Petri networks provide a rich body of theoretical results that may already address contemporary problems arising in the study of CRNs.</p>
<h4>Computational power of CRNs</h4>
<p>Before designing robust and practical systems, it is useful to know the limits to computing with a chemical soup. Some interesting theoretical results are already known for stochastic chemical reaction networks. The computational power of CRNs depend upon a number of factors, including: (i) is the computation deterministic, or probabilistic, and (ii) does the CRN have an initial context — certain species, independent of the input, that are initially present in some exact, constant count. </p>
<p>In general, CRNs with a constant number of species (independent of the input length) are capable of Turing universal computation [17], if the input is represented by the exact (unary) count of one molecular species, some small probability of error is permitted and an initial context in the form of a single-copy leader molecule is used. </p>
<p>Could the same result hold in the absence of an initial context? In a surprising result based on the distributed computing model of population protocols, it has been shown that if a computation must be error-free, then deterministic computation with CRNs having an initial context is limited to computing semilinear predicates [1], later extended to functions outputting natural numbers encoded by molecular counts [5]. </p>
<p>Furthermore, any semilinear predicate or function can be computed by that class of CRNs in expected time polylogarithmic in the input length. Building on this result, it was recently shown that by incurring an expected time linear in the input length, the same result holds for “leaderless” CRNs [8] — CRNs with no initial context. Can this result be improved to sub-linear expected time? Which class of functions can be computed deterministically by a CRN without an initial context in expected time polylogarithmic in the input length? </p>
<p>While (restricted) CRNs are Turing-universal, current results use space proportional to the computation time. Using a non-uniform construction, where the number of species is proportional to the input length and each initial species is present in some constant count, it is known that any S(n) space-bounded computation can be computed by a logically-reversible tagged CRN, within a reaction volume of size poly(S(n)) [18]. Tagged CRNs were introduced to model explicitly the fuel molecules in physical realizations of CRNs such as DNA strand displacement systems [6] that are necessary to supply matter and energy for implementing reactions such as X → X + Y that violate conservation of mass and/or energy. </p>
<p>Thus, for space-bounded computation, there exist CRNs that are time-efficient or are space-efficient. Does there exist time- and space-efficient CRNs to compute any space-bounded function?</p>
<h4>Designing and verifying robust CRNs</h4>
<p>While CRNs provide a concise model of chemistry, their physical realizations are often more complicated and more granular. How can one be sure they accurately implement the intended network behaviour? Probabilistic model checking has already been employed to find and correct inconsistencies between CRNs and their DNA strand displacement system (DSD) implementations [9]. However, at present, model checking of arbitrary CRNs is only capable of verifying the correctness of very small systems. Indeed, verification of these types of systems is a difficult problem: probabilistic state reachability is undecidable [17, 20] and general state reachability is EXPSPACE-hard [4]. </p>
<p>How can larger systems be verified? A deeper understanding of CRN behaviour may simplify the process of model checking. As a motivating example, there has been recent progress towards verifying that certain DSD implementations correctly simulate underlying CRNs [16, 7, 10]. This is an important step to ensuring correctness, prior to experiments. However, DSDs can also suffer from other errors when implementing CRNs, such as spurious hybridization or strand displacement. Can DSDs and more generally CRNs be designed to be robust to such predictable errors? Can error correcting codes and redundant circuit designs used in traditional computing be leveraged in these chemical computers? Many other problems arise when implementing CRNs. Currently, unique types of fuel molecules must be designed for every reaction type. This complicates the engineering process significantly. Can a universal type of fuel be designed to smartly implement any reaction?</p>
<h4>Energy efficient computing with CRNs</h4>
<p>Rolf Landauer showed that logically irreversible computation — computation as modeled by a standard Turing machine — dissipates an amount of energy proportional to the number of bits of information lost, such as previous state information, and therefore cannot be energy efficient [11]. However, Charles Bennett showed that, in principle, energy efficient computation is possible, by proposing a universal Turing machine to perform logically-reversible computation and identified nucleic acids (RNA/DNA) as a potential medium to realize logically-reversible computation in a physical system [2]. </p>
<p>There have been examples of logically-reversible DNA strand displacement systems — a physical realization of CRNs — that are, in theory, capable of complex computation [12, 19]. Are these systems energy efficient in a physical sense? How can this argument be made formally to satisfy both the computer science and the physics communities? Is a physical experiment feasible, or are these results merely theoretical footnotes?</p>

<p>Chemists are secretly doing applied category theory!  When chemists list a bunch of chemical reactions like</p>
<div align="center">
C + O₂ → CO₂
</div>
<p>they are secretly describing a &#8216;category&#8217;.</p>
<p>That shouldn&#8217;t be surprising.  A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory"><b>category</b></a> is simply a collection of things called <b>objects</b> together with things called <b>morphisms</b> going from one object to another, often written</p>
<div align="center">
f: x → y
</div>
<p>The rules of a category say:</p>
<p>1) we can compose a morphism f: x → y and another morphism g: y → z to get an arrow gf: x → z,</p>
<p>2) (hg)f = h(gf), so we don&#8217;t need to bother with parentheses when composing arrows,</p>
<p>3) every object x has an identity morphism 1ₓ: x → x that obeys 1ₓ f = f and f 1ₓ = f.</p>
<p>Whenever we have a bunch of things (objects) and processes (arrows) that take one thing to another, we&#8217;re likely to have a category.  In chemistry, the objects are bunches of molecules and the arrows are chemical reactions.  But we can &#8216;add&#8217; bunches of molecules and also add reactions, so we have something more than a mere category: we have something called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_monoidal_category">symmetric monoidal category</a>.</p>
<p>My talk here, part of <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2014/02/07/network-theory-talks-at-oxford/">a series</a>, is an explanation of this viewpoint and how we can use it to take ideas from elementary particle physics and apply them to chemistry!  ﻿For more details try this free book:</p>

					<p><i>guest post by <b><a href="http://www.tcs.tifr.res.in/~manoj/">Manoj Gopalkrishnan</a></b></i></p>
<p><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2013/10/11/autocatalysis-in-reaction-networks/">A few weeks back</a>, I promised to tell you more about a long-standing open problem in reaction networks, the &#8216;global attractor conjecture&#8217;. I am not going to quite get there today, but we shall take one step in that direction. </p>
<p>Today&#8217;s plan is to help you make friends with a very useful function we will call the &#8216;free energy&#8217; which comes up <i>all the time</i> in the study of chemical reaction networks. We will see that for complex-balanced systems, the free energy function decreases along trajectories of the rate equation. I&#8217;m going to explain this statement, and give you most of the proof! </p>
<p>The point of doing all this work is that we will then be able to invoke <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyapunov_stability">Lyapunov&#8217;s theorem</a> which implies stability of the dynamics. In Greek mythology, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus">Sisyphus</a> was cursed to roll a boulder up a hill only to have it roll down again, so that he had to keep repeating the task for all eternity.  When I think of an unstable equilibrium, I imagine a boulder delicately balanced on top of a hill, which will fall off if given the slightest push:</p>
<div align="center"><img width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/static.panoramio.com/photos/large/19658582.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p>or, more abstractly:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Unstable_equilibrium.svg/200px-Unstable_equilibrium.svg.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>On the other hand, I picture a stable equilibrium as a pebble at the very bottom of a hill.  Whichever way a perturbation takes it is up, so it will roll down again to the bottom:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/gopalkrishnan/Stable_Equilibrium.jpg" /></div>
<p>Lyapunov&#8217;s theorem guarantees stability provided we can exhibit a nice enough function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="V" class="latex" /> that decreases along trajectories. <i>&#8216;Nice enough&#8217;</i> means that, viewing <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="V" class="latex" /> as a height function for the hill, the equilibrium configuration should be at the bottom, and every direction from there should be up. If Sisyphus had dug a pit at the top of the hill for the boulder to rest in, Lyapunov&#8217;s theorem would have applied, and he could have gone home to rest. The moral of the story is that it pays to learn dynamical systems theory!</p>
<p>Because of the connection to Lyapunov&#8217;s theorem, such functions that decrease along trajectories are also called <b>Lyapunov functions</b>.  A similar situation is seen in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-theorem">Boltzmann&#8217;s H-theorem</a>, and hence such functions are sometimes called <b>H-functions</b> by physicists.</p>
<p>Another reason for me to talk about these ideas now is that I have posted a new article on the arXiv: </p>
<p>&bull; Manoj Gopalkrishnan, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.3043">On the Lyapunov function for complex-balanced mass-action systems</a>.</p>
<p>The free energy function in chemical reaction networks goes back at least to 1972, to this paper:</p>
<p>&bull; Friedrich Horn and Roy Jackson, General mass action kinetics, <i>Arch. Rational Mech. Analysis</i> <b>49</b> (1972), 81&ndash;116.</p>
<p>Many of us credit Horn and Jackson&#8217;s paper with starting the mathematical study of reaction networks. My paper is an exposition of the main result of Horn and Jackson, with a shorter and simpler proof. The gain comes because Horn and Jackson proved all their results from scratch, whereas I&#8217;m using some easy results from graph theory, and the log-sum inequality.</p>
<p>We shall be talking about reaction networks.  Remember the idea from the  <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/">network theory</a> series.  We have a set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S" class="latex" /> whose elements are called <b>species</b>, for example</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S+%3D+%5C%7B+%5Cmathrm%7BH%7D_2%5Cmathrm%7BO%7D%2C+%5Cmathrm%7BH%7D%5E%2B%2C+%5Cmathrm%7BOH%7D%5E-+%5C%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S = &#92;{ &#92;mathrm{H}_2&#92;mathrm{O}, &#92;mathrm{H}^+, &#92;mathrm{OH}^- &#92;}" class="latex" /></p>
<p>A <b>complex</b> is a vector of natural numbers saying how many items of each species we have.  For example, we could have a complex <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%282%2C3%2C1%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(2,3,1)." class="latex" />  But chemists would usually write this as</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2+%5Cmathrm%7BH%7D_2%5Cmathrm%7BO%7D+%2B+3+%5Cmathrm%7BH%7D%5E%2B+%2B+%5Cmathrm%7BOH%7D%5E-&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="2 &#92;mathrm{H}_2&#92;mathrm{O} + 3 &#92;mathrm{H}^+ + &#92;mathrm{OH}^-" class="latex" /></p>
<p>A <b>reaction network</b> is a set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S" class="latex" /> of species and a set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T" class="latex" /> of <b>transitions</b> or <b>reactions</b>, where each transition <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau+%5Cin+T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;tau &#92;in T" class="latex" /> goes from some complex <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%28%5Ctau%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="m(&#92;tau)" class="latex" /> to some complex <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%28%5Ctau%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n(&#92;tau)." class="latex" />  For example, we could have a transition <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;tau" class="latex" /> with </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%28%5Ctau%29+%3D+%5Cmathrm%7BH%7D_2%5Cmathrm%7BO%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="m(&#92;tau) = &#92;mathrm{H}_2&#92;mathrm{O}" class="latex" /> </p>
<p>and </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%28%5Ctau%29+%3D+%5Cmathrm%7BH%7D%5E%2B+%2B+%5Cmathrm%7BOH%7D%5E-&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n(&#92;tau) = &#92;mathrm{H}^+ + &#92;mathrm{OH}^-" class="latex" /> </p>
<p>In this situation chemists usually write </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BH%7D_2%5Cmathrm%7BO%7D+%5Cto+%5Cmathrm%7BH%7D%5E%2B+%2B+%5Cmathrm%7BOH%7D%5E-&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{H}_2&#92;mathrm{O} &#92;to &#92;mathrm{H}^+ + &#92;mathrm{OH}^-" class="latex" /> </p>
<p>but we want names like <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;tau" class="latex" /> for our transitions, so we might write</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau+%3A+%5Cmathrm%7BH%7D_2%5Cmathrm%7BO%7D+%5Cto+%5Cmathrm%7BH%7D%5E%2B+%2B+%5Cmathrm%7BOH%7D%5E-&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;tau : &#92;mathrm{H}_2&#92;mathrm{O} &#92;to &#92;mathrm{H}^+ + &#92;mathrm{OH}^-" class="latex" /></p>
<p>or </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BH%7D_2%5Cmathrm%7BO%7D+%5Cstackrel%7B%5Ctau%7D%7B%5Clongrightarrow%7D+%5Cmathrm%7BH%7D%5E%2B+%2B+%5Cmathrm%7BOH%7D%5E-&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathrm{H}_2&#92;mathrm{O} &#92;stackrel{&#92;tau}{&#92;longrightarrow} &#92;mathrm{H}^+ + &#92;mathrm{OH}^-" class="latex" /></p>
<p>As John explained in <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/networks_3.html">Part 3</a> of the network theory series, chemists like to work with a vector of nonnegative real numbers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%28t%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x(t)" class="latex" /> saying the <b>concentration</b> of each species at time <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="t." class="latex" />  If we know a <b>rate constant</b> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%28%5Ctau%29+%3E+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r(&#92;tau) &gt; 0" class="latex" /> for each transition <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;tau," class="latex" /> we can write down an equation saying how these concentrations change with time:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7Bd+x%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D+%5Csum_%7B%5Ctau+%5Cin+T%7D+r%28%5Ctau%29+%28n%28%5Ctau%29+-+m%28%5Ctau%29%29+x%5E%7Bm%28%5Ctau%29%7D+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{d x}{d t} = &#92;sum_{&#92;tau &#92;in T} r(&#92;tau) (n(&#92;tau) - m(&#92;tau)) x^{m(&#92;tau)} }" class="latex" /> </p>
<p>This is called the <b>rate equation</b>.  It&#8217;s really a system of ODEs describing how the concentration of each species change with time. Here an expression like <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5Em&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x^m" class="latex" /> is shorthand for the monomial <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_1%7D%5E%7Bm_1%7D+%5Ccdots+%7Bx_k%7D%5E%7Bm_k%7D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="{x_1}^{m_1} &#92;cdots {x_k}^{m_k}." class="latex" /></p>
<p>John and Brendan talked about <i>complex balance</i> in <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/networks_9.html">Part 9</a>.  I&#8217;m going to recall this definition, from a slightly different point of view that will be helpful for the result we are trying to prove. </p>
<p>We can draw a reaction network as a graph!  The vertices of this graph are all the complexes <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%28%5Ctau%29%2C+n%28%5Ctau%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="m(&#92;tau), n(&#92;tau)" class="latex" /> where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau+%5Cin+T.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;tau &#92;in T." class="latex" />  The edges are all the transitions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau%5Cin+T.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;tau&#92;in T." class="latex" />   We think of each edge <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;tau" class="latex" /> as directed, going from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%28%5Ctau%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="m(&#92;tau)" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%28%5Ctau%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n(&#92;tau)." class="latex" /></p>
<p>We will call the map that sends each transition <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;tau" class="latex" /> to the positive real number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%28%5Ctau%29+x%5E%7Bm%28%5Ctau%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r(&#92;tau) x^{m(&#92;tau)}" class="latex" /> the <b>flow</b> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_x%28%5Ctau%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_x(&#92;tau)" class="latex" /> on this graph. The rate equation can be rewritten very simply in terms of this flow as:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cfrac%7Bd+x%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D+%5Csum_%7B%5Ctau+%5Cin+T%7D%28n%28%5Ctau%29+-+m%28%5Ctau%29%29+%5C%2C+f_x%28%5Ctau%29+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;frac{d x}{d t} = &#92;sum_{&#92;tau &#92;in T}(n(&#92;tau) - m(&#92;tau)) &#92;, f_x(&#92;tau) }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>where the right-hand side is now a linear expression in the flow <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_x.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_x." class="latex" /> </p>
<p>Flows of water, or electric current, obey a version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchhoff's_circuit_laws#Kirchhoff.27s_current_law_.28KCL.29">Kirchhoff&#8217;s current law</a>. Such flows are called <b>conservative flows</b>. The following two lemmas from graph theory are immediate for conservative flows:</p>
<p><b>Lemma 1.</b> If f is a conservative flow then the net flow across every cut is zero.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut_%28graph_theory%29">cut</a> is a way of chopping the graph in two, like this:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut_%28graph_theory%29"><br />
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Max-cut.svg/200px-Max-cut.svg.png" /></a></div>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to prove Lemma 1 by induction, moving one vertex across the cut at a time.</p>
<p><b>Lemma 2.</b> If a conservative flow exists then every edge <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau%5Cin+T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;tau&#92;in T" class="latex" /> is part of a directed cycle. </p>
<p>Why is Lemma 2 true? Suppose there exists an edge <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau+%3A+m+%5Cto+n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;tau : m &#92;to n" class="latex" /> that is not part of any directed cycle. We will exhibit a cut with non-zero net flow. By Lemma 1, this will imply that the flow is not conservative. </p>
<p>One side of the cut will consist of all vertices from which <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="m" class="latex" /> is reachable by a directed path in the reaction network. The other side of the cut contains at least <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n," class="latex" /> since <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="m" class="latex" /> is not reachable from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n," class="latex" /> by the assumption that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;tau" class="latex" /> is not part of a directed cycle.  There is flow going from left to right of the cut, across the transition <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;tau." class="latex" /> Since there can be no flow coming back, this cut has nonzero net flow, and we&#8217;re done.   &nbsp; &nbsp; &#9646;</p>
<p>Now, back to the rate equation!  We can ask if the flow <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_x" class="latex" /> is conservative. That is, we can ask if, for every complex <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" />:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Csum_%7B%5Ctau+%3A+m+%5Cto+n%7D+f_x%28m%2Cn%29+%3D+%5Csum_%7B%5Ctau+%3A+n+%5Cto+p%7D+f_x%28n%2Cp%29.+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;sum_{&#92;tau : m &#92;to n} f_x(m,n) = &#92;sum_{&#92;tau : n &#92;to p} f_x(n,p). }" class="latex" /> </p>
<p>In words, we are asking if the sum of the flow through all transitions coming in to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" /> equals the sum of the flow through all transitions going out of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n." class="latex" /> If this condition is satisfied at a vector of concentrations <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%3D+%5Calpha%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x = &#92;alpha," class="latex" /> so that the flow <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%5Calpha&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_&#92;alpha" class="latex" /> is conservative, then we call <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;alpha" class="latex" /> a <b>point of complex balance</b>. If in addition, every component of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;alpha" class="latex" /> is <i>strictly positive</i>, then we say that the system is <b>complex balanced</b>.</p>
<p>Clearly if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;alpha" class="latex" /> is a point of complex balance, it&#8217;s an <b>equilibrium solution</b> of the rate equation.  In other words, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%28t%29+%3D+%5Calpha&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x(t) = &#92;alpha" class="latex" /> is a solution of the rate equation, where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%28t%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x(t)" class="latex" /> never changes.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;m using &#8216;equilibrium&#8217; the way mathematicians do.  But I should warn you that chemists use &#8216;equilibrium&#8217; to mean something more than merely a solution that doesn&#8217;t change with time.  They often also mean it&#8217;s a point of complex balance, or even more.  People actually get into arguments about this at conferences.</p>
<p>Complex balance implies more than mere equilibrium.  For starters, if a reaction network is such that every edge belongs to a directed cycle, then one says that the reaction network is <b>weakly reversible</b>. So Lemmas 1 and 2 establish that complex-balanced systems must be weakly reversible!</p>
<p>From here on, we fix a complex-balanced system, with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;alpha" class="latex" /> a strictly positive point of complex balance.</p>
<p><b>Definition.</b> The <b>free energy function</b> is the function </p>

<p>The whole point of defining the function this way is because it is the unique function, up to an additive constant, whose partial derivative with respect to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_s&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x_s" class="latex" /> is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clog+x_s%2F%5Calpha_s.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;log x_s/&#92;alpha_s." class="latex" /> This is important enough that we write it as a lemma.

<p>I find precise mathematical statements reassuring. You can often make up your mind about the truth value from a few examples. Very often, though not always, a few well-chosen examples are all you need to get the general idea for the proof. Such is the case for the above theorem. There are three key examples: the two-cycle, the three-cycle, and the figure-eight.</p>
<p><b>The two-cycle.</b>   The two-cycle is this reaction network:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/gopalkrishnan/2cycle.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>It has two complexes <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="m" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" /> and two transitions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau_1+%3D+m%5Cto+n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;tau_1 = m&#92;to n" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau_2+%3D+n%5Cto+m%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;tau_2 = n&#92;to m," class="latex" /> with rates <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r_1+%3D+r%28%5Ctau_1%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r_1 = r(&#92;tau_1)" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r_2+%3D+r%28%5Ctau_2%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r_2 = r(&#92;tau_2)" class="latex" /> respectively.</p>
<p>Fix a solution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%28t%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x(t)" class="latex" /> of the rate equation. Then the flow from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="m" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" /> equals <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r_1+x%5Em&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r_1 x^m" class="latex" /> and the backward flow equals <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r_2+x%5En.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r_2 x^n." class="latex" /> The condition for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%5Calpha&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_&#92;alpha" class="latex" /> to be a conservative flow requires that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%5Calpha+%3D+r_1+%5Calpha%5Em+%3D+r_2+%5Calpha%5En.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_&#92;alpha = r_1 &#92;alpha^m = r_2 &#92;alpha^n." class="latex" /> This is one binomial equation in at least one variable, and clearly has a solution in the positive reals. We have just shown that every two-cycle is complex balanced.</p>
<p>The derivative <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d+g_%5Calpha%28x%28t%29%29%2Fd+t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="d g_&#92;alpha(x(t))/d t" class="latex" /> can now be computed by the chain rule, using Lemma 3.  It works out to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%5Calpha&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_&#92;alpha" class="latex" /> times</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cleft%28%28x%2F%5Calpha%29%5Em+-+%28x%2F%5Calpha%29%5En%5Cright%29+%5C%2C+%5Clog%5Cfrac%7B%28x%2F%5Calpha%29%5En%7D%7B%28x%2F%5Calpha%29%5Em%7D+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;left((x/&#92;alpha)^m - (x/&#92;alpha)^n&#92;right) &#92;, &#92;log&#92;frac{(x/&#92;alpha)^n}{(x/&#92;alpha)^m} }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>This is never positive, and it&#8217;s zero if and only if </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2F%5Calpha%29%5Em+%3D+%28x%2F%5Calpha%29%5En&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(x/&#92;alpha)^m = (x/&#92;alpha)^n" class="latex" />   </p>
<p>Why is this? Simply because the logarithm of something greater than 1 is positive, while the log of something less than 1 is negative, so that the sign of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2F%5Calpha%29%5Em+-+%28x%2F%5Calpha%29%5En&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(x/&#92;alpha)^m - (x/&#92;alpha)^n" class="latex" /> is always opposite the sign of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clog+%5Cfrac%7B%28x%2F%5Calpha%29%5En%7D%7B%28x%2F%5Calpha%29%5Em%7D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;log &#92;frac{(x/&#92;alpha)^n}{(x/&#92;alpha)^m}." class="latex" /> We have verified our theorem for this example. </p>
<p>(Note that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2F%5Calpha%29%5Em+%3D+%28x%2F%5Calpha%29%5En&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(x/&#92;alpha)^m = (x/&#92;alpha)^n" class="latex" /> occurs when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%3D+%5Calpha%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x = &#92;alpha," class="latex" /> but also at other points: in this example, there is a whole <i>hypersurface</i> consisting of points of complex balance.)</p>
<p>In fact, this simple calculation achieves much more. </p>
<p><b>Definition.</b> A reaction network is <b>reversible</b> if for every transition <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau++%3A+m+%5Cto+n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;tau  : m &#92;to n" class="latex" /> there is a transition <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau%27+%3A+m+%5Cto+n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;tau&#039; : m &#92;to n" class="latex" /> going back, called the <b>reverse</b> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;tau." class="latex" />   Suppose we have a reversible reaction network and a vector of concentrations <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;alpha" class="latex" /> such that the flow along each edge equals that along the edge going back:</p>

<p>whenever <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau%27&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;tau&#039;" class="latex" /> is the reverse <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;tau." class="latex" /> Then we say the reaction network is <b>detailed balanced</b>, and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;alpha" class="latex" /> is a <b>point of detailed balance</b>.</p>
<p>For a detailed-balanced system, the time derivative of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g_%5Calpha&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="g_&#92;alpha" class="latex" /> is a sum over the contributions of pairs consisting of an edge and its reverse.  Hence, the two-cycle calculation shows that the theorem holds for all detailed balanced systems!</p>
<p>This linearity trick is going to prove very valuable. It will allow us to treat the general case of complex balanced systems <i>one cycle at a time</i>. The proof for a single cycle is essentially contained in the example of a three-cycle, which we treat next:</p>
<p><b>The three-cycle.</b>  The three-cycle is this reaction network:</p>

<p>We need to think about the sign of this quantity:</p>
<p><b>Lemma 3.</b> Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%2Cb%2Cc&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a,b,c" class="latex" /> be positive numbers. Then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a+%5Clog+b%2Fa+%2B+b%5Clog+c%2Fb+%2B+c%5Clog+a%2Fc&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a &#92;log b/a + b&#92;log c/b + c&#92;log a/c" class="latex" /> is less than or equal to zero, with equality precisely when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3Db%3Dc.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a=b=c." class="latex" /></p>
<p>The proof is a direct application of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_sum_inequality">log sum inequality</a>. In fact, this holds not just for three numbers, but for any finite list of numbers. Indeed, that is precisely how one obtains the proof for cycles of arbitrary length. Even the two-cycle proof is a special case! If you are wondering how the log sum inequality is proved, it is an application of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen's_inequality">Jensen&#8217;s inequality</a>, that workhorse of convex analysis.</p>
<p>The three-cycle calculation extends to a proof for the theorem <i>so long as there is no directed edge that is shared between two directed cycles</i>. When there are such edges, we need to argue that the flows <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%5Calpha&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_&#92;alpha" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_x" class="latex" /> can be split between the cycles sharing that edge in a consistent manner, so that the cycles can be analyzed independently. We will need the following simple lemma about conservative flows from graph theory. We will apply this lemma to the flow <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%5Calpha.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_&#92;alpha." class="latex" /></p>
<p><b>Lemma 4.</b> Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" /> be a conservative flow on a graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="G." class="latex" /> Then there exist directed cycles <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_1%2C+C_2%2C%5Cdots%2C+C_k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C_1, C_2,&#92;dots, C_k" class="latex" /> in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="G," class="latex" /> and nonnegative real &#8216;flows&#8217; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_1%2Cf_2%2C%5Cdots%2Cf_k+%5Cin+%5B0%2C%5Cinfty%5D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_1,f_2,&#92;dots,f_k &#92;in [0,&#92;infty]" class="latex" /> such that for each directed edge <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="e" class="latex" /> in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="G," class="latex" /> the flow <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28e%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f(e)" class="latex" /> equals the sum of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_i" class="latex" /> over <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i" class="latex" /> such the cycle <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C_i" class="latex" /> contains the edge <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="e." class="latex" /></p>
<p>Intuitively, this lemma says that conservative flows come from constant flows on the directed cycles of the graph. How does one show this lemma? I&#8217;m sure there are several proofs, and I hope some of you can share some of the really neat ones with me. The one I employed was algorithmic. The idea is to pick a cycle, any cycle, and subtract the maximum constant flow that this cycle allows, and repeat. This is most easily understood by looking at the example of the figure-eight:</p>
<p><b>The figure-eight.</b>  This reaction network consists of two three-cycles sharing an edge:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/gopalkrishnan/figure8.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>Here&#8217;s the proof for Lemma 4. Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" /> be a conservative flow on this graph. We want to exhibit cycles and flows on this graph according to Lemma 4. We arbitrarily pick <i>any cycle</i> in the graph. For example, in the figure-eight, suppose we pick the cycle <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u_0%5Cto+u_1%5Cto+u_2%5Cto+u_0.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="u_0&#92;to u_1&#92;to u_2&#92;to u_0." class="latex" /> We pick an edge in this cycle on which the flow is minimum. In this case, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28u_0%5Cto+u_1%29+%3D+f%28u_2%5Cto+u_0%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f(u_0&#92;to u_1) = f(u_2&#92;to u_0)" class="latex" /> is the minimum.  We define a <b>remainder flow</b> by subtracting from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" /> this constant flow which was restricted to one cycle. So the remainder flow is the same as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" /> on edges that don&#8217;t belong to the picked cycle. For edges that belong to the cycle, the remainder flow is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" /> minus the minimum of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" /> on this cycle. We observe that this remainder flow satisfies the conditions of Lemma 4 on a graph with strictly fewer edges. Continuing in this way, since the lemma is trivially true for the empty graph, we are done by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_infinite_descent">infinite descent</a>.</p>
<p>Now that we know how to split the flow <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%5Calpha&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_&#92;alpha" class="latex" /> across cycles, we can figure out how to split the rates across the different cycles. This will tell us how to split the flow <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_x" class="latex" /> across cycles. Again, this is best illustrated by an example.</p>
<p><b>The figure-eight.</b>  Again, this reaction network looks like</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/gopalkrishnan/figure8.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>Suppose as in Lemma 4, we obtain the cycles </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_1+%3D+u_0%5Cto+u_1%5Cto+u_2%5Cto+u_0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C_1 = u_0&#92;to u_1&#92;to u_2&#92;to u_0" class="latex" /> </p>
<p>with constant flow <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%5Calpha%5E1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_&#92;alpha^1" class="latex" /> </p>
<p>and </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_2+%3D+u_3%5Cto+u_1%5Cto+u_2%5Cto+u_3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C_2 = u_3&#92;to u_1&#92;to u_2&#92;to u_3" class="latex" /> with constant flow <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%5Calpha%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_&#92;alpha^2" class="latex" /> such that </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%5Calpha%5E1+%2B+f_%5Calpha%5E2+%3D+f_%5Calpha%28u_1%5Cto+u_2%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_&#92;alpha^1 + f_&#92;alpha^2 = f_&#92;alpha(u_1&#92;to u_2)" class="latex" /></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the picture: </p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/gopalkrishnan/figure8n.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>Then we obtain rates <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%5E1%28u_1%5Cto+u_2%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r^1(u_1&#92;to u_2)" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%5E2%28u_1%5Cto+u_2%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r^2(u_1&#92;to u_2)" class="latex" /> by solving the equations</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5E1_%5Calpha+%3D+r%5E1%28u_1%5Cto+u_2%29+%5Calpha%5E%7Bu_1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f^1_&#92;alpha = r^1(u_1&#92;to u_2) &#92;alpha^{u_1}" class="latex" /> </p>

<p>Using these rates, we can define non-constant flows <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5E1_x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f^1_x" class="latex" /> on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C_1" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5E2_x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f^2_x" class="latex" /> on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C_2" class="latex" /> by the usual formulas:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5E1_x%28u_1%5Cto+u_2%29+%3D+r%5E1%28u_1%5Cto+u_2%29+x%5E%7Bu_1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f^1_x(u_1&#92;to u_2) = r^1(u_1&#92;to u_2) x^{u_1}" class="latex" /></p>
<p>and similarly for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5E2_x.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f^2_x." class="latex" />  In particular, this gives us</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5E1_x%28u_1%5Cto+u_2%29%2Ff%5E1_%5Calpha+%3D+%28x%2F%5Calpha%29%5E%7Bu_1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f^1_x(u_1&#92;to u_2)/f^1_&#92;alpha = (x/&#92;alpha)^{u_1}" class="latex" /></p>
<p>and similarly for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5E2_x.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f^2_x." class="latex" /></p>
<p>Using this, we obtain the proof of the Theorem!  The time derivative of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g_%5Calpha&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="g_&#92;alpha" class="latex" /> along a trajectory has a contribution from each cycle <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C" class="latex" /> as in Lemma 4, where each cycle is treated as a separate system with the new rates <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%5EC%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r^C," class="latex" /> and the new flows <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5EC_%5Calpha&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f^C_&#92;alpha" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5EC_x.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f^C_x." class="latex" />  So, we&#8217;ve reduced the problem to the case of a cycle, which we&#8217;ve already done.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s review what happened. The time derivative of the function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g_%5Calpha&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="g_&#92;alpha" class="latex" /> has a very nice form, which is linear in the flow <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_x.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_x." class="latex" /> The reaction network can be broken up into cycles. Th e conservative flow <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%5Calpha&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_&#92;alpha" class="latex" /> for a complex balanced system can be split into conservative flows on cycles by Lemma 4. This informs us how to split the non-conservative flow <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_x" class="latex" /> across cycles. By linearity of the time derivative, we can separately treat the case for every cycle. For each cycle, we get an expression to which the log sum inequality applies, giving us the final result that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g_%5Calpha&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="g_&#92;alpha" class="latex" /> decreases along trajectories of the rate equation.</p>
<p>Now that we have a Lyapunov function, we will put it to use to obtain some nice theorems about the dynamics, and finally state the global attractor conjecture. All that and more, in the next blog post!</p>

On average, for every 555 million molecules of water, <i>one</i> is split into a negatively charged OH⁻ and a positively charged H⁺.  And this actually matters a lot, in chemistry.  It&#8217;s the reason we say water has pH 7.</p>
<p>Why?  By definition, pH 7 means that for every liter of water, there&#8217;s 10<sup>-7</sup> moles of H⁺.  That&#8217;s where the 7 comes from.  But there&#8217;s 55.5 moles of water in every liter, at least when the water is cold so its density is almost 1 kilogram/liter.  So, do the math and you see one that for 555 million molecules of water, there&#8217;s only one H⁺.</p>
<p>Acids have a lot more.  For example, lemon juice has one H⁺ per 8800 water molecules.</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s think about this H⁺ thing.  What is it, really?  It&#8217;s a hydrogen atom missing its electron: a proton, all by itself!</p>
<p>But what happens when you&#8217;ve got a lone proton in water?   It doesn&#8217;t just sit there.  It quickly attaches to a water molecule, forming H₃O⁺.  This is called a <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydronium">hydronium</a></b> ion, and it looks like this:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydronium"><br />
<img width="100" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/chemical/hydronium.png" /></a></div>
<p>But hydronium is still positively charged, so it will attract electrons in <i>other</i> water molecules!  Different things can happen.  Here you see a hydronium ion water molecule surrounded by three water molecules in a symmetrical way:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://kb.osu.edu/dspace/handle/1811/52464"><br />
<img src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/chemical/Eigen_cation.gif" /></a></div>
<p>This is called an <b>Eigen cation</b>, with chemical formula H₉O₄⁺.  I believe it&#8217;s named after the Nobel-prize-winning chemist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manfred_Eigen">Manfred Eigen</a>&#8212;not his grandfather Günther, the mathematician of &#8216;eigenvector&#8217; fame.</p>
<p>And here you see a hydronium ion at lower right, attracted to water molecule at left:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydronium#Solvation"><br />
<img width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/chemical/Zundel_cation.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>The is a <b>Zundel cation</b>, with chemical formula H₅O₂⁺.  It&#8217;s named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Zundel">Georg Zundel</a>, the German expert on hydrogen bonds.  The H⁺ in the middle looks more tightly connected to the water at right than the water at left.  But it should be completely symmetrical&#8212;at least, that&#8217;s the theory of how a Zundel cation works.</p>
<p>But the Eigen and Zundel cations are <i>still</i> positively charged, so they attract more water molecules, making bigger and bigger structures.  Nowadays chemists are studying these using computer simulations, and comparing the results to experiments.  In 2010, Evgenii Stoyanov, Irina Stoyanova and Christopher Reed used infrared spectroscopy to argue that a lone proton often attaches itself to 6 water molecules, forming H⁺(H₂O)₆, or H₁₃O₆⁺, like this:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydronium#Solvation"><br />
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/chemical/water_stoyanov.gif" /></a></div>
<p>As you can see, this forms when each hydrogen in a Zundel cation attracts an extra water molecule.</p>
<p>Even this larger structure attracts more water molecules:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydronium"><br />
<img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/chemical/water_stoyanov.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>But the positive charge, they claim, stays roughly within the dotted line.</p>
<p>Wait.  Didn&#8217;t I say the lone proton was right in the middle?  Isn&#8217;t that what the picture shows&#8212;the H in the middle?</p>
<p>Well, the picture is a bit misleading!   First, everything is wiggling around a lot.  And second, quantum mechanics says we don&#8217;t know the position of that proton precisely!  Instead, it&#8217;s a &#8216;probability cloud&#8217; smeared over a large region, ending roughly at the dashed line.  (You can&#8217;t say precisely where a cloud ends.)</p>
<p>It seems that something about these subtleties makes the distance between the two oxygen nuclei at the center is surprisingly large.  In an ordinary water molecule, the distance between the hydrogen and oxygen is a bit less than 100 pm&#8212;that&#8217;s 100 picometers, or 100 × 10<sup>-12</sup> meters, or one angstrom (Å) in chemist&#8217;s units:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Properties_of_water"><br />
<img width="300" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/chemical/water_labelled.png" /></a></div>
<p>In ordinary ice, there are also weaker bonds called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_bond"><b>hydrogen bonds</b></a> that attach neighboring water molecules.  These bonds are a bit longer, as shown in this picture by <a href="http://www.chem1.com/acad/webtext/states/water.html">Stephen Lower</a>, who also drew that great picture of ice:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://www.chem1.com/acad/webtext/states/state-images/water_H-bonding.png"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/chemical/water_H-bonding.png" /></a></div>
<p>But the distance between the two central oxygens in H₁₃O₆⁺ is about 2.57 angstroms, or twice 1.28:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydronium"><br />
<img src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/chemical/water_stoyanov_labelled.gif" /></a></div>
<p>Stoyanov, Stoyanova and Reed put the exclamation mark here. I guess the big distance came as a big surprise!</p>
<p>I should emphasize that this work is new and still controversial.   There&#8217;s some evidence, which I don&#8217;t understand, that 20 is a &#8216;magic number&#8217;: a lone proton is happiest when accompanied by 20 water molecules, forming H⁺(H₂O)₂₀.  One possibility is that the proton is surrounded by a symmetrical cage of 20 water molecules shaped like a dodecahedron!  But in 2005, a team of scientists did computer simulations and arrived at a different geometry, like this:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/jcp/123/8/10.1063/1.2007628"><img width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/chemical/water_iyengar.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>This is not symmetrical: there&#8217;s a Zundel cation highlighted at right, together with 20 water molecules.</p>
<p>Of course, in reality a number of <i>different</i> structures may predominate, in a rapidly changing and random way.  Computer simulations should eventually let us figure this out.  We&#8217;ve known the relevant laws of nature for over 80 years.    But running them on a computer is not easy!  Kieron Taylor did his PhD work on simulating water, and he wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
It&#8217;s a most vexatious substance to simulate in useful time scales. Including the proton exchange or even flexible multipoles requires immense computation.
</p></blockquote>
<p>It would be very interesting if the computational complexity of water were higher, in some precise sense, than many other liquids.  It&#8217;s weird in other ways.  It takes a lot of energy to heat water, it expands when it freezes, and its molecules have a large &#8216;dipole moment&#8217;&#8212;meaning the electric charge is distributed in a very lopsided way, thanks to the &#8216;Mickey Mouse&#8217; way the two H&#8217;s are attached to the O.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been talking about the fate of the H⁺ when a water molecule splits into H⁺ and OH⁻.   I should add that in heavy water, H⁺ could be something other than a lone proton.  It could be a <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuteron#Nuclear_properties_.28the_deuteron.29">deuteron</a></b>: a proton and a neutron stuck together.  Or it could be a <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tritium">triton</a></b>: a proton and <i>two</i> neutrons.   For this reason, while most chemists call H⁺ simply a &#8216;proton&#8217;, the pedantically precise ones call it a <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydron_%28chemistry%29">hydron</a></b>, which covers all the possibilities!</p>
<p>But what about the OH⁻?  This is called a <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxide">hydroxide ion</a></b>:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxide"><br />
<img width="100" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/chemical/hydroxide.png" /></a></div>
<p>But this, too, attracts other water molecules.  First it grabs one and forms a <b>bihydroxide ion</b>, which is a chain like this:</p>
<div align="center">
H&#8212;O&#8212;H&#8212;O&#8212;H
</div>
<p>with chemical formula H₃O₂⁻.  And then the bihydroxide ion attracts other water molecules, perhaps like this:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxide"><br />
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/chemical/bihydroxide.png" /></a></div>
<p>Again, this is a guess&#8212;and certainly a simplified picture of a dynamic, quantum-mechanical system.  Here&#8217;s a nice picture of the chemist <a href="https://crystallography365.wordpress.com/2014/05/10/jd-bernal-and-the-structure-of-water/">J. D. Bernal</a> with a model of liquid water molecules:</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b>  The H⁺(aq) ion in ionized strong aqueous acids is an unexpectedly unique H₁₃O₆⁺ entity, unlike those in gas phase H⁺(H₂O)n clusters or typical crystalline acid hydrates. IR spectroscopy indicates that the core structure has neither H₉O₄⁺ Eigen-like nor typical H₅O₂⁺ Zundel-like character. Rather, extensive delocalization of the positive charge leads to a H₁₃O₆⁺ ion having an unexpectedly long central OO separation of 2.57 Å and four conjugated OO separations of 2.7 Å. These dimensions are in conflict with the shorter OO separations found in structures calculated by theory. Ultrafast dynamic properties of the five H atoms involved in these H-bonds lead to a substantial collapse of normal IR vibrations and the appearance of a continuous broad absorption (cba) across the entire IR spectrum. This cba is distinguishable from the broad IR bands associated with typical low-barrier H-bonds. The solvation shell outside of the H₁₃O₆⁺ ion defines the boundary of positive charge delocalization. At low acid concentrations, the H₁₃O₆⁺ ion is a constituent part of an ion pair that has contact with the first hydration shell of the conjugate base anion. At higher concentrations, or with weaker acids, one or two H₂O molecules of H₁₃O₆⁺ cation are shared with the hydration shell of the anion. Even the strongest acids show evidence of ion pairing.﻿

<b>Abstract.</b> The <i>ab initio</i> atom-centered density-matrix propagation approach and the multistate empirical valence bond method have been employed to study the structure, dynamics, and rovibrational spectrum of a hydrated proton in the “magic” 21 water cluster. In addition to the conclusion that the hydrated proton tends to reside on the surface of the cluster, with the lone pair on the protonated oxygen pointing “outwards,” it is also found that dynamical effects play an important role in determining the vibrational properties of such clusters.

					<p><i>guest post by <b><a href="http://www.tcs.tifr.res.in/~manoj/">Manoj Gopalkrishnan</a></b></i></p>
<p>Since this is my first time writing a blog post here, let me start with a word of introduction. I am a computer scientist at the <a href="http://www.tifr.res.in/">Tata Institute of Fundamental Research</a>, broadly interested in connections between Biology and Computer Science, with a particular interest in reaction networks. I first started thinking about them during my Ph.D. at the <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/molecular-science/">Laboratory for Molecular Science</a>.  My fascination with them has been predominantly mathematical. As a graduate student, I encountered an area with rich connections between combinatorics and dynamics, and surprisingly easy-to-state and compelling unsolved conjectures, and got hooked.</p>
<p>There is a story about Richard Feynman that he used to take bets with mathematicians. If any mathematician could make Feynman understand a mathematical statement, then Feynman would guess whether or not the statement was true. Of course, Feynman was in a habit of winning these bets, which allowed him to make the boast that mathematics, especially in its obsession for proof, was essentially irrelevant, since a relative novice like himself could after a moment&#8217;s thought guess at the truth of these mathematical statements. I have always felt Feynman&#8217;s claim to be unjust, but have often wondered what mathematical statement I would put to him so that his chances of winning were no better than random.</p>
<p>Today I want to tell you of a result about reaction networks that I have recently discovered with Abhishek Deshpande. The statement seems like a fine candidate to throw at Feynman because until we proved it, I would not have bet either way about its truth. Even after we obtained a short and elementary proof, I do not completely &#8216;see&#8217; why it must be true. I am hoping some of you will be able to demystify it for me. So, I&#8217;m just going to introduce enough terms to be able to make the statement of our result, and let you think about how to prove it.</p>
<p>John and his colleagues have been talking about reaction networks as Petri nets in the <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/">network theory</a> series on this blog.  As discussed in <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/03/31/network-theory-part-2/">part 2</a> of that series, a Petri net is a diagram like this:</p>
<div align="center"><img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/wolf-rabbit.png" /></div>
<p>Following John&#8217;s terminology, I will call the aqua squares &#8216;transitions&#8217; and the yellow circles &#8216;species&#8217;.  If we have some number #rabbit of rabbits and some number #wolf of wolves, we draw #rabbit many black dots called &#8216;tokens&#8217; inside the yellow circle for rabbit, and #wolf tokens inside the yellow circle for wolf, like this:</p>
<div align="center"><img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/wolf-rabbit_3_4.png" /></div>
<p>Here #rabbit = 4 and #wolf = 3.  The predation transition consumes one &#8216;rabbit&#8217; token and one &#8216;wolf&#8217; token, and produces two &#8216;wolf&#8217; tokens, taking us here:</p>
<div align="center"><img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/wolf-rabbit_4_3.png" /></div>
<p>John explained in <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/networks_2.html">parts 2</a> and <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/04/03/network-theory-part-3/">3</a> how one can put rates on different transitions. For today I am only going to be concerned with &#8216;reachability:&#8217; what token states are reachable from what other token states.  John talked about this idea in <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/networks_25.html">part 25</a>.</p>
<p>By a <b>complex</b> I will mean a population vector: a snapshot of the number of tokens in each species.  In the example above, (#rabbit, #wolf) is a complex. If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%2C+y%27&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y, y&#039;" class="latex" /> are two complexes, then we write </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y+%5Cto+y%27&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y &#92;to y&#039;" class="latex" /> </p>
<p>if we can get from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%27&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y&#039;" class="latex" /> by a single transition in our Petri net.  For example, we just saw that </p>

<p><b>Reachability</b>, denoted <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cto%5E%2A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;to^*" class="latex" />, is the transitive closure of the relation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cto&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;to" class="latex" />.

<p>I am very interested in switches. After all, a computer is essentially a box of switches! You can build computers by connecting switches together. In fact, that&#8217;s how early computers like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z3_%28computer%29">Z3</a> were built. The CMOS gates at the heart of modern computers are essentially switches. By analogy, the study of switches in reaction networks may help us understand biochemical circuits.</p>
<p>A <b>siphon</b> is a set of species that is &#8216;switch-offable&#8217;. That is, if there are no tokens in the siphon states, then they will remain absent in future.  Equivalently, the only reactions that can produce tokens in the siphon states are those that require tokens from the siphon states before they can fire. Note that no matter how many rabbits there are, if there are no wolves, there will continue to be no wolves. So {wolf} is a siphon. Similarly, {rabbit} is a siphon, as is the union {rabbit, wolf}. However, when Hydrogen and Oxygen form Water, {Water} is not a siphon.  </p>
<p>For another example, consider this Petri net:</p>
<div align="center"><img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/chemistryNetBasicA.png" /></div>
<p>The set {HCl, NaCl} is a siphon. However, there is a conservation law: whenever an HCl token is destroyed, an NaCl token is created, so that #HCl + #NaCl is invariant. If both HCl and NaCl were present to begin with, the complexes where both are absent are not reachable.  In this sense, this siphon is not &#8216;really&#8217; switch-offable.   As a first pass at capturing this idea, we will introduce the notion of &#8216;critical set&#8217;.  </p>
<p>A <b>conservation law</b> is a linear expression involving numbers of tokens that is invariant under every transition in the Petri net. A conservation law is <b>positive</b> if all the coefficients are non-negative.  A <b>critical set</b> of states is a set that does not contain the support of a positive conservation law.  </p>
<p>For example, the support of the positive conservation law #HCl + #NaCl is {HCl, NaCl}, and hence no set containing this set is critical.  Thus {HCl, NaCl} is a siphon, but not critical.  On the other hand, the set {NaCl} is critical but not a siphon.   {HCl} is a critical siphon.  And in our other example, {Wolf, Rabbit} is a critical siphon. </p>
<p>Of particular interest to us will be <b>minimal critical siphons</b>, the minimal sets among critical siphons.  Consider this example:</p>
<div align="center"><img width="350" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/siphons.png" /></div>
<p>Here we have two transitions: </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X+%5Cto+2Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X &#92;to 2Y" class="latex" /> </p>
<p>and </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2X+%5Cto+Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="2X &#92;to Y" class="latex" />  </p>
<p>The set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7BX%2CY%5C%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;{X,Y&#92;}" class="latex" /> is a critical siphon.  But so is the smaller set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7BX%5C%7D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;{X&#92;}." class="latex" />  So, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7BX%2CY%5C%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;{X,Y&#92;}" class="latex" /> is not minimal.</p>
<p>We define a <b>self-replicable</b> set to be a set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> of species such that there exist complexes <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%27&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y&#039;" class="latex" /> with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%5Cto%5E%2A+y%27&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y&#92;to^* y&#039;" class="latex" /> such that for all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i+%5Cin+A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="i &#92;in A" class="latex" /> we have </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%27_i+%3E+y_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y&#039;_i &gt; y_i" class="latex" /> </p>
<p>So, there are transitions that accomplish the job of creating more tokens for all the species in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A." class="latex" />  In other words: these species can &#8216;replicate themselves&#8217;.</p>
<p>We define a <b>drainable</b> set by changing the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%3E&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&gt;" class="latex" /> to a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%3C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&lt;" class="latex" />.  So, there are transitions that accomplish the job of <i>reducing</i> the number of tokens for all the species in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A." class="latex" />  These species can &#8216;drain away&#8217;.</p>
<p>Now here comes the statement: </p>
<div align="center">
<i>Every minimal critical siphon is either drainable or self-replicable!</i></div>
<p>We prove it in this paper:</p>
<p>&bull; Abhishek Deshpande and Manoj Gopalkrishnan,  <a href="https://selectedpapers.net/arxiv/1309.3957">Autocatalysis in reaction networks</a>.</p>
<p>But first note that the statement becomes false if the critical siphon is not minimal.  Look at this example again:</p>
<div align="center"><img width="350" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/siphons.png" /></div>
<p>The set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7BX%2CY%5C%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;{X,Y&#92;}" class="latex" /> is a critical siphon.  However <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7BX%2CY%5C%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;{X,Y&#92;}" class="latex" /> is neither self-replicable (since every reaction destroys <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" />) nor drainable (since every reaction produces <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Y" class="latex" />).   But we&#8217;ve already seen that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7BX%2CY%5C%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;{X,Y&#92;}" class="latex" /> is not minimal.  It has a critical subsiphon, namely <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7BX%5C%7D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;{X&#92;}." class="latex" />   This one <i>is</i> minimal&mdash;and it obeys our theorem, because it is drainable.  </p>
<p>Checking these statements is a good way to make sure you understand the concepts!  I know I&#8217;ve introduced a lot of terminology here, and it takes a while to absorb.</p>
<p>Anyway: our proof that every minimal critical siphon is either drainable or self-replicable makes use of a fun result about matrices. Consider a real square matrix with a sign pattern like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cleft%28+%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Bcccc%7D+%3C0+%26+%3E0+%26+%5Ccdots+%26+%3E+0+%5C%5C+%3E0+%26+%3C0+%26+%5Ccdots+%26%3E+0+%5C%5C+%5Cvdots+%26+%5Cvdots+%26+%3C0+%26%3E+0+%5C%5C+%3E0+%26+%3E0+%26+%5Ccdots+%26+%3C0+%5Cend%7Barray%7D+%5Cright%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;left( &#92;begin{array}{cccc} &lt;0 &amp; &gt;0 &amp; &#92;cdots &amp; &gt; 0 &#92;&#92; &gt;0 &amp; &lt;0 &amp; &#92;cdots &amp;&gt; 0 &#92;&#92; &#92;vdots &amp; &#92;vdots &amp; &lt;0 &amp;&gt; 0 &#92;&#92; &gt;0 &amp; &gt;0 &amp; &#92;cdots &amp; &lt;0 &#92;end{array} &#92;right)" class="latex" /></p>
<p>If the matrix is full-rank then there is a positive linear combination of the rows of the matrix so that all the entries are nonzero and have the same sign.  In fact, we prove something stronger in Theorem 5.9 of our paper.  At first, we thought this statement about matrices should be equivalent to one of the many well-known alternative statements of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farkas%27_lemma">Farkas&#8217; lemma</a>, like Gordan&#8217;s theorem. </p>
<p>However, we could not find a way to make this work, so we ended up proving it by a different technique. Later, my colleague <a href="http://www.tcs.tifr.res.in/%7Ejaikumar/">Jaikumar Radhakrishnan</a> came up with a clever proof that uses Farkas&#8217; lemma twice. However, so far we have not obtained the stronger result in Theorem 5.9 with this proof technique.</p>
<p>My interest in the result that every minimal critical siphon is either drainable or self-replicable is not purely aesthetic (though aesthetics is a big part of it). There is a research community of folks who are thinking of reaction networks as a programming language, and synthesizing molecular systems that exhibit sophisticated dynamical behavior as per specification:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.dna-computing.org/">International Conference on DNA Computing and Molecular Programming</a>.</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.cs.duke.edu/FNANO/">Foundations of Nanoscience: Self-Assembled Architectures and Devices</a>.</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://molecular-programming.org/">Molecular Programming Architectures, Abstractions, Algorithms and Applications</a>. </p>
<p>Networks that exhibit some kind of catalytic behavior are a recurring theme among such systems, and even more so in biochemical circuits. </p>
<p>Here is an example of catalytic behavior:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+%2B+C+%5Cto+B+%2B+C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A + C &#92;to B + C" class="latex" /></p>
<p>The &#8216;catalyst&#8217; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C" class="latex" /> helps transform <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B." class="latex" /> In the absence of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C," class="latex" /> the reaction is turned off. Hence, catalysts are switches in chemical circuits! From this point of view, it is hardly surprising that they are required for the synthesis of complex behaviors.</p>
<p>In information processing, one needs amplification to make sure that a signal can propagate through a circuit without being overwhelmed by errors. Here is a chemical counterpart to such amplification:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+%2B+C+%5Cto+2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A + C &#92;to 2C" class="latex" /></p>
<p>Here the catalyst <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C" class="latex" /> catalyzes its own production: it is an &#8216;autocatalyst&#8217;, or a self-replicating species. By analogy, autocatalysis is key for scaling synthetic molecular systems.</p>
<p>Our work deals with these notions on a network level. We generalize the notion of catalysis in two ways. First, we allow a catalyst to be a set of species instead of a single species; second, its absence can turn off a reaction pathway instead of a single reaction. We propose the notion of self-replicable siphons as a generalization of the notion of autocatalysis. In particular, &#8216;weakly reversible&#8217; networks have critical siphons precisely when they exhibit autocatalytic behavior.  I was led to this work when I noticed the manifestation of this last statement in many examples.</p>
<p>Another hope I have is that perhaps one can study the dynamics of each minimal critical siphon of a reaction network separately, and then somehow be able to answer interesting questions about the dynamics of the entire network, by stitching together what we know for each minimal critical siphon. On the synthesis side, perhaps this could lead to a programming language to synthesize a reaction network that will achieve a specified dynamics. If any of this works out, it would be really cool! I think of how abelian group theory (and more broadly, the theory of abelian categories, which includes categories of vector bundles) benefits from a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_group#Classification">fundamental theorem</a> that lets you break a finite abelian group into parts that are easy to study&mdash;or how number theory benefits from a special case, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic">fundamental theorem of arithmetic</a>.  John has also pointed out that reaction networks are really presentations of symmetric monoidal categories, so perhaps this could point the way to a Fundamental Theorem for Symmetric Monoidal Categories. </p>
<p>And then there is the Global Attractor Conjecture, a<br />
long-standing open problem concerning the long-term behavior of solutions to the <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/04/03/network-theory-part-3/">rate equations</a>. Now that is a whole story by itself, and will have to wait for another day.</p>

			<div class="textwidget"><p>You can <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics">include math in your comments using LaTeX</a>,  but you need to do it this way:</p>
<p>&#036;latex  E = mc^2&#036;</p>
<p>You need the word 'latex' right after the first dollar sign, and it needs a space after it.  Double dollar signs don't work, and other limitations apply, some described <a href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/latex/">here</a>.  You can't preview comments here, but I'm happy to fix errors.</p>
