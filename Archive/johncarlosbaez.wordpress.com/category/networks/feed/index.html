<p>Decorated cospans are a framework for studying open systems invented by Brendan Fong.  Since I&#8217;m now visiting the institute he and David Spivak set up&#8212;the <a href="https://topos.institute/">Topos Institute</a>&#8212;it was a great time to give a talk explaining the history of decorated cospans, their problems, and how those problems have been solved:</p>
<p><b>Structured vs Decorated Cospans</b></p>
<blockquote><p>
  <b>Abstract.</b> One goal of applied category theory is to understand open systems: that is, systems that can interact with the external world. We compare two approaches to describing open systems as morphisms: structured and decorated cospans.  Each approach provides a symmetric monoidal double category.   Structured cospans are easier, decorated cospans are more general, but under certain conditions the two approaches are equivalent.  We take this opportunity to explain some tricky issues that have only recently been resolved.
</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s probably best to <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/structured_vs_decorated/structured_vs_decorated_topos_web.pdf">get the slides here</a> and look at them while watching this video:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>guest post by <b><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/John_Foley10">John Foley</a></b></i></p>
<p>Though the <a href="http://www.darpa.mil/program/complex-adaptive-system-composition-and-design-environment">Complex Adaptive System Composition and Design Environment</a> (CASCADE) program concluded in Fall 2020, just this week <b>two</b> new articles came out reviewing the work and future research directions:</p>
<p>• John Baez and John Foley, <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/202106/rnoti-p1005.pdf">Operads for designing systems of systems</a>, <i>Notices of the American Mathematical Society</i> <b>68</b> (2021), 1005&#8211;1007.</p>
<p>• John Foley, <a href="https://www.nist.gov/people/spencer-breiner">Spencer Breiner</a>, <a href="https://engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/subrahmanian-eswaran.html">Eswaran Subrahmanian</a> and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/John-Dusel">John Dusel</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rspa.2021.0099">Operads for complex system design specification, analysis and synthesis</a>, <i>Proceedings of the Royal Society A</i> <b>477</b> (2021), 20210099.</p>
<h4>Operads for Designing Systems of Systems</h4>
<p>The first is short and sweet (~2 pages!), aimed at a general mathematical audience.  It describes the motivation for CASCADE and how basic modeling issues for point-to-point communications led to the development <i>network operads</i>:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/202106/rnoti-p1005.pdf"><img data-attachment-id="31172" data-permalink="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2021/06/25/complex-adaptive-system-design-part-10/syntaxsem/" data-orig-file="https://johncarlosbaez.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/syntaxsem.png" data-orig-size="350,133" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="SyntaxSem" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://johncarlosbaez.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/syntaxsem.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://johncarlosbaez.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/syntaxsem.png?w=350" src="https://johncarlosbaez.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/syntaxsem.png?w=450" alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-31172" srcset="https://johncarlosbaez.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/syntaxsem.png 350w, https://johncarlosbaez.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/syntaxsem.png?w=150 150w, https://johncarlosbaez.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/syntaxsem.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px"   /><br />
</a></div>
<p>This figure depicts the prototypical example of this style of operad, the &#8216;simple network operad&#8217;, acting on an algebra of graphs whose nodes are endowed with locations and edges can be no longer than a fixed range limit. For more information, check out <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/202106/rnoti-p1005.pdf">the article</a> or <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2017/08/22/complex-adaptive-system-design-part-4/">Part 4</a> of this series.</p>
<p>For a quick, retrospective overview of CASCADE, this note is hard to beat, so I won’t repeat more here.</p>
<h4>Operads for complex system design specification, analysis and synthesis</h4>
<p>The second article is a full length review, aimed at a general applied science audience:</p>
<blockquote><p>
We introduce operads for design to a general scientific audience by explaining what the operads do relative to broadly applied techniques and how specific domain problems are modelled. Research directions are presented with an eye towards opening up interdisciplinary partnerships and continuing application-driven investigations to build on recent insights.</p></blockquote>
<p>The review describes how operads apply to system design problems through three examples:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rspa.2021.0099"><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="31176" data-permalink="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2021/06/25/complex-adaptive-system-design-part-10/specanalsyn/" data-orig-file="https://johncarlosbaez.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/specanalsyn.png" data-orig-size="507,154" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="SpecAnalSyn" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://johncarlosbaez.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/specanalsyn.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://johncarlosbaez.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/specanalsyn.png?w=450" src="https://johncarlosbaez.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/specanalsyn.png?w=450&#038;h=137" alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-31176" width="450" height="137" srcset="https://johncarlosbaez.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/specanalsyn.png?w=450&amp;h=137 450w, https://johncarlosbaez.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/specanalsyn.png?w=150&amp;h=46 150w, https://johncarlosbaez.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/specanalsyn.png?w=300&amp;h=91 300w, https://johncarlosbaez.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/specanalsyn.png 507w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></div>
<p>and concludes with a discussion of future research directions.  The specification and synthesis examples come from applications of network operads in CASCADE, but the analysis example was contributed by collaborators <a href="https://www.nist.gov/people/spencer-breiner">Spencer Breiner</a> and <a href="https://engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/subrahmanian-eswaran.html">Eswaran Subrahmanian</a> at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), who analyzed the Length Scale Interferometer (LSI) at NIST headquarters.  Readers interested in a quick introduction to these examples should head directly to Section 3 of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rspa.2021.0099">the review</a>.</p>
<p>As we describe:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The present article captures an intermediate stage of technical maturity: operad-based design has shown its practicality by lowering barriers of entry for applied practitioners and demonstrating applied examples across many domains. However, it has not realized its full potential as an applied meta-language. Much of this recent progress is not focused solely on the analytic power of operads to separate concerns. Significant progress on explicit specification of domain models and techniques to automatically synthesize designs from basic building blocks has been made.
</p></blockquote>
<p>With this context, CASCADE’s contribution was prototyping general-purpose methods to specify basic building blocks and synthesize composite systems from atoms.  By testing these methods against specific domain problems, we learned that domain-specific information should be exploited but <i>systematically</i> fitting together general-purpose and computationally efficient methods is challenging.  Moreover, no reconciliation between the analytic point-of-view on operads for system design and the `generative’ perspective of network operads, which facilitate specification and synthesis, has been established.  The review does not address how these threads might fit together precisely, but perhaps the answer looks something like this:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://topos.institute/">Topos Institute</a> is in business!  I&#8217;m really excited about visiting there this summer and working on applied category theory.</p>
<p>They recently had a meeting with some people concerned about AI risks, called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhgq-BqyZ7i7XQX41HUfMO4TJeF0mOXbJ">Finding the Right Abstractions</a>, organized by Scott Garrabrant, David Spivak, and Andrew Critch.  I gave a gentle introduction to the uses of symmetric monoidal categories:</p>
<p>&bull; Symmetric monoidal categories: a Rosetta Stone.</p>
<blockquote><p>
To describe systems composed of interacting parts, scientists and engineers draw diagrams of networks: flow charts, Petri nets, electrical circuit diagrams, signal-flow graphs, chemical reaction networks, Feynman diagrams and the like.  All these different diagrams fit into a common framework: the mathematics of symmetric monoidal categories.  While originally the morphisms in such categories were mainly used to describe <i>processes</i>, we can also use them to describe <i>open systems</i>.

<p>Together with <a href="">William Cannon</a> and <a href="https://iigb.ucr.edu/blli/">Larry Li</a>, I&#8217;m helping run a minisymposium as part of <a href="https://www.smb2021.org/home">SMB2021</a>, the annual meeting of the Society for Mathematical Biology:</p>
<p>• Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics in Biology: from Chemical Reaction Networks to Natural Selection, Monday June 14, 2021, beginning 9:30 am Pacific Time.</p>
<p>You can register for free <a href="https://www.smb2021.org/registration">here</a> before May 31st, 11:59 pm Pacific Time.  You need to register to watch the talks live on Zoom.  I think the talks will be recorded.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the idea:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <strong>Abstract:</strong> Since Lotka, ﻿physical scientists have argued that living things belong to a class of complex and orderly systems that exist not despite the second law of thermodynamics, but because of it. Life and evolution, through natural selection of dissipative structures, are based on non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The challenge is to develop an understanding of what the respective physical laws can tell us about flows of energy and matter in living systems, and about growth, death and selection. This session will address current challenges including understanding emergence, regulation and control across scales, and entropy production, from metabolism in microbes to evolving ecosystems.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s exciting to me because I want to get back into work on thermodynamics and reaction networks, and we&#8217;ll have some excellent speakers on these topics.  I think the talks will be in this order&#8230; later I will learn the exact schedule.</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Heat flows adjust local ion concentrations in favor of prebiotic chemistry</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <strong>Abstract:</strong> Prebiotic reactions often require certain initial concentrations of ions. For example, the activity of RNA enzymes requires a lot of divalent magnesium salt, whereas too much monovalent sodium salt leads to a reduction in enzyme function. However, it is known from leaching experiments that prebiotically relevant geomaterial such as basalt releases mainly a lot of sodium and only little magnesium. A natural solution to this problem is heat fluxes through thin rock fractures, through which magnesium is actively enriched and sodium is depleted by thermogravitational convection and thermophoresis. This process establishes suitable conditions for ribozyme function from a basaltic leach. It can take place in a spatially distributed system of rock cracks and is therefore particularly stable to natural fluctuations and disturbances.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Stochastic chemical reaction networks</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <strong>Abstract:</strong> The study of chemical reaction networks (CRNs) is a very active field. Earlier well-known results (Feinberg Chem. Enc. Sci. 42 2229 (1987), Anderson et al Bull. Math. Biol. 72 1947 (2010)) identify a topological quantity called deficiency, easy to compute for CRNs of any size, which, when exactly equal to zero, leads to a unique factorized (non-equilibrium) steady-state for these networks. No general results exist however for the steady states of non-zero-deficiency networks. In recent work, we show how to write the full moment-hierarchy for any non-zero-deficiency CRN obeying mass-action kinetics, in terms of equations for the factorial moments. Using these, we can recursively predict values for lower moments from higher moments, reversing the procedure usually used to solve moment hierarchies. We show, for non-trivial examples, that in this manner we can predict any moment of interest, for CRNs with non-zero deficiency and non-factorizable steady states. It is however an open question how scalable these techniques are for large networks.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Nonequilibrium biomolecular information processes</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <strong>Abstract:</strong> Nearly 70 years have passed since the discovery of DNA structure and its role in coding genetic information. Yet, the kinetics and thermodynamics of genetic information processing in DNA replication, transcription, and translation remain poorly understood. These template-directed copolymerization processes are running away from equilibrium, being powered by extracellular energy sources. Recent advances show that their kinetic equations can be exactly solved in terms of so-called iterated function systems. Remarkably, iterated function systems can determine the effects of genome sequence on replication errors, up to a million times faster than kinetic Monte Carlo algorithms. With these new methods, fundamental links can be established between molecular information processing and the second law of thermodynamics, shedding a new light on genetic drift, mutations, and evolution.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Reduction and the Quasi-Steady State Approximation</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <strong>Abstract:</strong> Chemical reactions often occur at different time-scales. In applications of chemical reaction network theory it is often desirable to reduce a reaction network to a smaller reaction network by elimination of fast species or fast reactions. There exist various techniques for doing so, e.g. the Quasi-Steady-State Approximation or the Rapid Equilibrium Approximation. However, these methods are not always mathematically justifiable.  Here, a method is presented for which (so-called) non-interacting species are eliminated by means of QSSA. It is argued that this method is mathematically sound. Various examples are given (Michaelis-Menten mechanism, two-substrate mechanism, &#8230;) and older related techniques from the 50-60ies are briefly discussed.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Deficiency of chemical reaction networks and thermodynamics</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <strong>Abstract:</strong> Deficiency is a topological property of a Chemical Reaction Network linked to important dynamical features, in particular of deterministic fixed points and of stochastic stationary states. Here we link it to thermodynamics: in particular we discuss the validity of a strong vs. weak zeroth law, the existence of time-reversed mass-action kinetics, and the possibility to formulate marginal fluctuation relations. Finally we illustrate some subtleties of the Python module we created for MCMC stochastic simulation of CRNs, soon to be made public.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> The principle of maximum caliber of nonequilibria</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <strong>Abstract:</strong> Maximum Caliber is a principle for inferring pathways and rate distributions of kinetic processes.  The structure and foundations of MaxCal are much like those of Maximum Entropy for static distributions.  We have explored how MaxCal may serve as a general variational principle for nonequilibrium statistical physics &#8211; giving well-known results, such as the Green-Kubo relations, Onsager&#8217;s reciprocal relations and Prigogine&#8217;s Minimum Entropy Production principle near equilibrium, but is also applicable far from equilibrium.  I will also discuss some applications, such as finding reaction coordinates in molecular simulations non-linear dynamics in gene circuits, power-law-tail distributions in &#8220;social-physics&#8221; networks, and others.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Using the maximum entropy production principle to understand and predict microbial biogeochemistry</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <strong>Abstract:</strong> Natural microbial communities contain billions of individuals per liter and can exceed a trillion cells per liter in sediments, as well as harbor thousands of species in the same volume. The high species diversity contributes to extensive metabolic functional capabilities to extract chemical energy from the environment, such as methanogenesis, sulfate reduction, anaerobic photosynthesis, chemoautotrophy, and many others, most of which are only expressed by bacteria and archaea. Reductionist modeling of natural communities is problematic, as we lack knowledge on growth kinetics for most organisms and have even less understanding on the mechanisms governing predation, viral lysis, and predator avoidance in these systems. As a result, existing models that describe microbial communities contain dozens to hundreds of parameters, and state variables are extensively aggregated. Overall, the models are little more than non-linear parameter fitting exercises that have limited, to no, extrapolation potential, as there are few principles governing organization and function of complex self-assembling systems. Over the last decade, we have been developing a systems approach that models microbial communities as a distributed metabolic network that focuses on metabolic function rather than describing individuals or species. We use an optimization approach to determine which metabolic functions in the network should be up regulated versus those that should be down regulated based on the non-equilibrium thermodynamics principle of maximum entropy production (MEP). Derived from statistical mechanics, MEP proposes that steady state systems will likely organize to maximize free energy dissipation rate. We have extended this conjecture to apply to non-steady state systems and have proposed that living systems maximize entropy production integrated over time and space, while non-living systems maximize instantaneous entropy production. Our presentation will provide a brief overview of the theory and approach, as well as present several examples of applying MEP to describe the biogeochemistry of microbial systems in laboratory experiments and natural ecosystems.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Persistence, permanence, and global stability in reaction network models: some results inspired by thermodynamic principles</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <strong>Abstract:</strong> The standard mathematical model for the dynamics of concentrations in biochemical networks is called mass-action kinetics. We describe mass-action kinetics and discuss the connection between special classes of mass-action systems (such as detailed balanced and complex balanced systems) and the Boltzmann equation. We also discuss the connection between the &#8220;global attractor conjecture&#8221; for complex balanced mass-action systems and Boltzmann&#8217;s H-theorem. We also describe some implications for biochemical mechanisms that implement noise filtering and cellular homeostasis.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Large deviations theory and emergent landscapes in biological dynamics</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <strong>Abstract:</strong> The mathematical theory of large deviations provides a nonequilibrium thermodynamic description of complex biological systems that consist of heterogeneous individuals. In terms of the notions of stochastic elementary reactions and pure kinetic species, the continuous-time, integer-valued Markov process dictates a thermodynamic structure that generalizes (i) Gibbs’ macroscopic chemical thermodynamics of equilibrium matters to nonequilibrium small systems such as living cells and tissues; and (ii) Gibbs’ potential function to the landscapes for biological dynamics, such as that of C. H. Waddington’s and S. Wright’s.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Coauthors:</strong> Micah Brush, Kaito Umemura</p>
<p><strong>Title:</strong> Nonequilibrium dynamics of disturbed ecosystems</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <strong>Abstract:</strong> The Maximum Entropy Theory of Ecology (METE) predicts the shapes of macroecological metrics in relatively static ecosystems, across spatial scales, taxonomic categories, and habitats, using constraints imposed by static state variables. In disturbed ecosystems, however, with time-varying state variables, its predictions often fail. We extend macroecological theory from static to dynamic, by combining the MaxEnt inference procedure with explicit mechanisms governing disturbance. In the static limit, the resulting theory, DynaMETE, reduces to METE but also predicts a new scaling relationship among static state variables. Under disturbances, expressed as shifts in demographic, ontogenic growth, or migration rates, DynaMETE predicts the time trajectories of the state variables as well as the time-varying shapes of macroecological metrics such as the species abundance distribution and the distribution of metabolic rates over individuals. An iterative procedure for solving the dynamic theory is presented. Characteristic signatures of the deviation from static predictions of macroecological patterns are shown to result from different kinds of disturbance. By combining MaxEnt inference with explicit dynamical mechanisms of disturbance, DynaMETE is a candidate theory of macroecology for ecosystems responding to anthropogenic or natural disturbances.</p></blockquote>

<p>Some of us just finished a paper clarifying the connection between two approaches to describing open systems&#8212;that is, systems that can interact with their environment, and can be composed to form larger open systems:</p>
<p>&bull; John Baez, Kenny Courser and Christina Vasilakopolou, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09363">Structured versus decorated cospans</a>.</p>
<p>And, next week I&#8217;m giving a talk about it at YAMCaTS!  This is not a conference for felines who like sweet potatoes: it&#8217;s the <a href="https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/mathematics/extranet/staff-material/staff-profiles/simona-paoli/yorkshire-and-midlands-category-theory-seminar-yamcats">Yorkshire and Midlands Category Seminar</a>, organized by Simona Paoli, Nicola Gambino and Steve Vickers.</p>
<p>In my talk, I&#8217;ll start by sketching some ideas behind Halter and Patterson&#8217;s software for quickly assembling larger models of COVID-19 from smaller models.  Then, I&#8217;ll dig deeper into the underlying math, where we use &#8216;structured&#8217; or &#8216;decorated&#8217; cospans to model open systems.</p>
<p>This quickly gets into some serious category theory&#8212;and since YAMCaTS is a category theory seminar, I won&#8217;t shy away from that.   Here are my slides:</p>
<p>&bull; John Baez, <a href="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/structured_vs_decorated/">Structured vs decorated cospans</a>, YAMCaTS, Friday 5 February 2021, 17:00 UTC.  <a href="https://universityofleeds.zoom.us/j/81042397132?pwd=RTg3MFV1TUt2YzJXZVZJSkhoOEQwQT09">Zoom link here</a>, meeting ID 810 4239 7132; to get in use 68302x where x is a one-digit perfect number.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <strong>Abstract.</strong> One goal of applied category theory is to understand open systems: that is, systems that can interact with the external world. We compare two approaches to describing open systems as cospans equipped with extra data: structured and decorated cospans. Each approach provides a symmetric monoidal double category, and we prove that under certain conditions these symmetric monoidal double categories are isomorphic. We illustrate these ideas with applications to dynamical systems and epidemiological modeling. This is joint work with Kenny Courser and Christina Vasilakopoulou.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if my talk will be recorded, but it will be on Zoom so recording it would be easy, and I&#8217;ll try to get the organizers to do that.</p>

<p>You may wonder why I&#8217;m returning to this <i>now</i>, after three months of silence.  The reason is that Kenny, Christina Vasilakopolou, and I just finished a paper that continues this story:</p>
<p>• John Baez, Kenny Courser and Christina Vasilakopoulou, <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/cospans.pdf">Structured versus decorated cospans</a>.</p>
<p>We showed that under certain conditions, structured and decorated cospans are equivalent.  So, I&#8217;m excited about this stuff again.</p>
<p>Last time I explained Fong&#8217;s theorem about decorated cospans:</p>
<p><b><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.00872">Fong&#8217;s Theorem.</a></b>  Suppose <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathsf%7BA%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathsf{A}" class="latex" /> is a category with finite <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/colimit">colimits</a>, and make <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathsf%7BA%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathsf{A}" class="latex" /> into a <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/symmetric+monoidal+category">symmetric monoidal category</a> with its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coproduct">coproduct</a> as the tensor product.  Suppose <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%5Ccolon+%28%5Cmathsf%7BA%7D%2C%2B%29+%5Cto+%28%5Cmathsf%7BSet%7D%2C%5Ctimes%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F&#92;colon (&#92;mathsf{A},+) &#92;to (&#92;mathsf{Set},&#92;times)" class="latex" /> is a <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/monoidal+functor">symmetric lax monoidal functor</a>. Define an <b><i>F</i>-decorated cospan</b> to be a cospan</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/decorated_cospans/decorated_cospan_without_decoration.png"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/decorated_cospans/decorated_cospan_without_decoration.png" width="190" /></a></div>
<p>in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathsf%7BA%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathsf{A}" class="latex" /> together with an element <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5Cin+F%28N%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x&#92;in F(N)" class="latex" /> called a <b>decoration</b>.  Then there is a symmetric monoidal category with</p>
<p>• objects of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathsf%7BA%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathsf{A}" class="latex" /> as objects,<br />
• isomorphism classes of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F" class="latex" />-decorated cospans as morphisms.</p>
<p>The theorem is <i>true</i>, but it doesn&#8217;t apply to all the examples we wanted it to.  The problem is that it&#8217;s &#8216;not categorified enough&#8217;.   It&#8217;s fine if we want to decorate the apex <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="N" class="latex" /> of our cospan with some extra <i>structure</i>: we do this by choosing an element of some <i>set</i> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%28N%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F(N)." class="latex" />  But in practice, we often want to decorate <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="N" class="latex" /> with some extra <i>stuff</i>, which means choosing an object of a <i>category</i> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%28N%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F(N)." class="latex" />   So we should really use not a functor</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%5Ccolon+%28%5Cmathsf%7BA%7D%2C%2B%29+%5Cto+%28%5Cmathsf%7BSet%7D%2C%5Ctimes%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F&#92;colon (&#92;mathsf{A},+) &#92;to (&#92;mathsf{Set},&#92;times)" class="latex" />
</div>
<p>but something like a functor</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%5Ccolon+%28%5Cmathsf%7BA%7D%2C%2B%29+%5Cto+%28%5Cmathbf%7BCat%7D%2C%5Ctimes%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F&#92;colon (&#92;mathsf{A},+) &#92;to (&#92;mathbf{Cat},&#92;times)" class="latex" />
</div>
<p>What do I mean by &#8216;something like a functor?&#8217;   Well, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbf%7BCat%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbf{Cat}" class="latex" /> is not just a category but a 2-category: it has categories as objects, functors as morphisms, but also natural transformations as 2-morphisms.   The natural notion of &#8216;something like a functor&#8217; from a category to a 2-category is called a <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/pseudofunctor">pseudofunctor</a>.   And just as we can define symmetric lax monoidal functor, we can define a symmetric lax monoidal pseudofunctor.</p>
<p>All these nuances really matter when we&#8217;re studying open graphs, as we were <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2020/09/16/open-systems-a-double-categorical-perspective-part-2/">last time</a>!</p>
<p>Here we want the feet of our structured cospan to be finite sets and the apex to be a finite graph.   So, we have <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathsf%7BA%7D+%3D+%5Cmathsf%7BFinSet%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathsf{A} = &#92;mathsf{FinSet}" class="latex" /> and for any <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N+%5Cin+%5Cmathsf%7BFinSet%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="N &#92;in &#92;mathsf{FinSet}" class="latex" /> we want <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%28N%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F(N)" class="latex" /> to be the set, or category, of finite graphs having <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="N" class="latex" /> as their set of nodes.</p>
<p>I explained last time all the disasters that ensue when you try to let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%28N%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F(N)" class="latex" /> be the <i>set</i> of finite graphs having <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="N" class="latex" /> as its set of nodes.  You can try, but you will pay dearly for it!   You can struggle and fight, like Hercules trying to chop all the heads off the Hydra, but you still can&#8217;t get a symmetric lax monoidal functor</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%5Ccolon+%28%5Cmathsf%7BA%7D%2C%2B%29+%5Cto+%28%5Cmathsf%7BSet%7D%2C%5Ctimes%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F&#92;colon (&#92;mathsf{A},+) &#92;to (&#92;mathsf{Set},&#92;times)" class="latex" />
</div>
<p>that sends any finite set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="N" class="latex" /> to the set of graphs having <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="N" class="latex" /> as their set of nodes.</p>
<p>But there is a perfectly nice <i>category</i> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%28N%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F(N)" class="latex" /> of all finite graphs having <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="N" class="latex" /> as their set of nodes.  And you <i>can</i> get a symmetric lax monoidal pseudofunctor</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%5Ccolon+%28%5Cmathsf%7BA%7D%2C%2B%29+%5Cto+%28%5Cmathbf%7BCat%7D%2C%5Ctimes%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F&#92;colon (&#92;mathsf{A},+) &#92;to (&#92;mathbf{Cat},&#92;times)" class="latex" />
</div>
<p>that sends any any finite set to the <i>category</i> of finite graphs having it as nodes.  So you should stop fighting and go with the flow.</p>
<p>Kenny, Christina and I proved an enhanced version of Fong&#8217;s theorem that works starting from this more general kind of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F." class="latex" />   And instead of just giving you a symmetric monoidal <i>category</i>, this theorem gives you a symmetric monoidal <i>double category</i>.</p>
<p>In fact, that is something you should have wanted already, even with Fong&#8217;s original hypotheses!  The clue is that Fong&#8217;s theorem uses <i>isomorphism classes</i> of decorated cospans, which suggests we&#8217;d get something better if we used decorated cospans themselves.  Kenny tackled this a while ago, getting a version of Fong&#8217;s theorem that produces a symmetric monoidal double category, and another version that produces a symmetric monoidal bicategory:</p>
<p>&bull; Kenny Courser, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08100">A bicategory of decorated cospans</a>, <i>Theory and Applications of Categories</i> <b>32</b> (2017), 995&#8211;1027.</p>
<p>Over the years we&#8217;ve realized that the double category is better, because it contains more information and is easier to work with.   So, in our new improved approach to decorated cospans, we go straight for the jugular and get a double category.   And here&#8217;s how it works:</p>
<p><b><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/cospans.pdf">Theorem.</a></b>  Suppose <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathsf%7BA%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathsf{A}" class="latex" /> is a category with finite colimits, and make <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathsf%7BA%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathsf{A}" class="latex" /> into a symmetric monoidal category with its coproduct as the tensor product.  Suppose <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%5Ccolon+%28%5Cmathsf%7BA%7D%2C%2B%29+%5Cto+%28%5Cmathbf%7BCat%7D%2C%5Ctimes%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F&#92;colon (&#92;mathsf{A},+) &#92;to (&#92;mathbf{Cat},&#92;times)" class="latex" /> is a symmetric lax monoidal pseudofunctor.   Then there is a symmetric monoidal double category <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%5Cmathbb%7BC%7D%5Cmathbf%7Bsp%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F&#92;mathbb{C}&#92;mathbf{sp}" class="latex" /> in which</p>
<p>• an object is an object of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathsf%7BA%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathsf{A}" class="latex" /><br />
&bull; a vertical morphism is a morphism in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathsf%7BA%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathsf{A}" class="latex" /><br />
• a horizontal morphism is an <b><i>F</i>-decorated cospan</b>, meaning a cospan in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathsf%7BA%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathsf{A}" class="latex" /> together with a decoration:</p>

<p>&bull; a 2-morphism is a <b>map of decorated cospans</b>, meaning a commutative diagram in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathsf%7BA%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathsf{A}" class="latex" />:</p>

<p>together with a morphism <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau+%5Ccolon+F%28h%29%28x%29+%5Cto+x%27%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;tau &#92;colon F(h)(x) &#92;to x&#039;," class="latex" /> the <b>map of decorations</b>.</p>
<p>We call <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%5Cmathbb%7BC%7D%5Cmathbf%7Bsp%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="F&#92;mathbb{C}&#92;mathbf{sp}" class="latex" /> a <b>decorated cospan double category</b>.  And as our paper explains, this idea lets us fix all the broken attempted applications of Fong&#8217;s original decorated cospan categories!</p>
<p>All this is just what any category theorist worth their salt would try, in order to fix the original problems with decorated cospans.  It turns out that <i>proving</i> the theorem above is not so easy, mainly because the definition of &#8216;symmetric monoidal double category&#8217; is rather complex.  But if you accept the theorem&mdash;including the details of how you get the symmetric monoidal structure on the double category, which I have spared you here&mdash;then it doesn&#8217;t really matter much that the proof takes work.</p>
<p>Next time I&#8217;ll tell you about the <i>other</i> way to fix the original decorated cospan formalism: structured cospans.  When these work, they are often easier to use.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>guest post by <strong><a href="https://home.sandiego.edu/~shulman/">Michael Shulman</a></strong></em></p>
<p>Now that John gave an <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2021/01/17/categories-of-nets/">overview</a> of the Petri nets paper that he and I have just written with Jade and Fabrizio, I want to dive a bit more into what we accomplish.  The genesis of this paper was a paper written by Fabrizio and several other folks entitled <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12974">Computational Petri Nets: Adjunctions Considered Harmful</a>, which of course sounds to a category theorist like a challenge.  Our paper, and particularly the notion of &Sigma;-net and the adjunction in the middle column relating &Sigma;-nets to symmetric strict monoidal categories, is an answer to that challenge.</p>
<p>Suppose you wanted to &#8220;freely&#8221; generate a symmetric monoidal category from some combinatorial data.  What could that data be?  In other words (for a category theorist at least), what sort of category <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathsf%7BC%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathsf{C}" class="latex" /> appears in an adjunction <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathsf%7BC%7D+%5Crightleftarrows+%5Cmathsf%7BSMC%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathsf{C} &#92;rightleftarrows &#92;mathsf{SMC}" class="latex" />?  (By the way, all monoidal categories in this post will be strict, so I&#8217;m going to drop that adjective for conciseness.)</p>
<p>Perhaps the simplest choice is the same data that naturally generates a plain category, namely a directed graph.  However, this is pretty limited in terms of what symmetric monoidal categories it can generate, since the generating morphisms will always only have single generating objects as their domain and codomain.</p>
<p>Another natural choice is the same data that naturally generates a <em>multicategory</em>, which might be called a &#8220;multigraph&#8221;: a set of objects together with, for every tuple of objects <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_n&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x_1,&#92;dots,x_n" class="latex" /> and single object <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y" class="latex" />, a set of arrows from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_n%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(x_1,&#92;dots,x_n)" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="y" class="latex" />.  In the generated symmetric monoidal category, such an arrow gives rise to a morphism <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1%5Cotimes%5Ccdots%5Cotimes+x_n+%5Cto+y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x_1&#92;otimes&#92;cdots&#92;otimes x_n &#92;to y" class="latex" />; thus we can now have multiple generating objects in the domains of generating morphisms, but not the codomains.</p>
<p>Of course, this suggests an even better solution: a set of objects, together with a set of arrows for every pair of tuples <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_m%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(x_1,&#92;dots,x_m)" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28y_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cy_n%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(y_1,&#92;dots,y_n)" class="latex" />.  I&#8217;d be tempted to call this a &#8220;polygraph&#8221;, since it also naturally generates a polycategory.  But other folks got there first and called it a &#8220;tensor scheme&#8221; and also a &#8220;pre-net&#8221;.  In the latter case, the objects are called &#8220;places&#8221; and the morphisms &#8220;transitions&#8221;.  But whatever we call it, it allows us to generate free symmetric monoidal categories in which the domains and codomains of generating morphisms can both be arbitrary tensor products of generating objects.  For those who like fancy higher-categorical machinery, it&#8217;s the notion of <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/computad">computad</a> obtained from the monad for symmetric monoidal categories.</p>
<p>However, pre-nets are not without flaws.  One of the most glaring, for people who actually want to compute with freely generated symmetric monoidal categories, is that there aren&#8217;t enough morphisms between them.  For instance, suppose one pre-net <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="N" class="latex" /> has three places <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2Cy%2Cz&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x,y,z" class="latex" /> and a transition <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%3A%28x%2Cx%2Cy%29+%5Cto+z&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f:(x,x,y) &#92;to z" class="latex" />, while a second pre-net <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N%27&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="N&#039;" class="latex" /> has three places <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%27%2Cy%27%2Cz%27&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x&#039;,y&#039;,z&#039;" class="latex" /> and a transition <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%27%3A%28x%27%2Cy%27%2Cx%27%29+%5Cto+z%27&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f&#039;:(x&#039;,y&#039;,x&#039;) &#92;to z&#039;" class="latex" />.  Once we generate a symmetric monoidal category, then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" /> can be composed with a symmetry <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5Cotimes+y+%5Cotimes+x+%5Ccong+x%5Cotimes+x%5Cotimes+y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x&#92;otimes y &#92;otimes x &#92;cong x&#92;otimes x&#92;otimes y" class="latex" /> and similarly for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%27&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f&#039;" class="latex" />; so the symmetric monoidal categories generated by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="N" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N%27&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="N&#039;" class="latex" /> are isomorphic.  But there isn&#8217;t even a single <em>map</em> of pre-nets from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="N" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N%27&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="N&#039;" class="latex" /> or vice versa, because a map of pre-nets has to preserve the ordering on the inputs and outputs.  This is weird and annoying for combinatorial data that&#8217;s supposed to present a <em>symmetric</em> monoidal category.</p>
<p>Another way of making essentially the same point is that just as the adjunction between SMCs and directed graphs factors through categories, and the adjunction between SMCs and multigraphs factors through multicategories, the adjunction between SMCs and pre-nets factors through non-symmetric monoidal categories.  In other words, a pre-net is really better viewed as data for generating a non-symmetric monoidal category, which we can then freely add symmetries to.</p>
<p>By contrast, in the objects that we call &#8220;Petri nets&#8221;, the domain and codomain of each generating morphism are elements of the free <em>commutative monoid</em> on the set of places&#8212;as opposed to elements of the free <em>monoid</em>, which is what they are for a pre-net.  Thus, the domain of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%27&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f&#039;" class="latex" /> above would be <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2Bx%2By&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x+x+y" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2By%2Bx&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x+y+x" class="latex" /> respectively, which in a commutative monoid are equal (both are <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2x%2By&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="2x+y" class="latex" />).  So the corresponding Petri nets of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="N" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N%27&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="N&#039;" class="latex" /> are indeed isomorphic.  However, once we squash everything down in this way, we lose the ability to functorially generate a <em>symmetric</em> monoidal category; all we can generate is a <em>commutative</em> monoidal category where all the symmetries are identities.</p>
<p>At this point we&#8217;ve described the upper row and the left- and right-hand columns in John&#8217;s diagram:</p>
<div align="center">

</div>
<p>What&#8217;s missing is a kind of net in the middle that corresponds to symmetric monoidal categories.  To motivate the definition of &Sigma;-net, consider how to solve the problem above of the &#8220;missing morphisms&#8221;.  We want to send <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%3A%28x%2Cx%2Cy%29+%5Cto+z&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f:(x,x,y) &#92;to z" class="latex" /> to a &#8220;permuted version&#8221; of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%27%3A%28x%27%2Cy%27%2Cx%27%29+%5Cto+z%27&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f&#039;:(x&#039;,y&#039;,x&#039;) &#92;to z&#039;" class="latex" />.  For this to be implemented by an actual set-map, we need this &#8220;permuted version&#8221; to be <em>present</em> in the data of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N%27&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="N&#039;" class="latex" /> somehow.  This suggests that the transitions should come with a permutation action like that of, say, a symmetric multicategory.  Then inside <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N%27&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="N&#039;" class="latex" /> we can actually act on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%27&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f&#039;" class="latex" /> by the transposition <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau+%3D+%282%2C3%29+%5Cin+S_3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;tau = (2,3) &#92;in S_3" class="latex" />, yielding a new morphism <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau%28f%27%29+%3A+%28x%27%2Cx%27%2Cy%27%29%5Cto+z%27&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;tau(f&#039;) : (x&#039;,x&#039;,y&#039;)&#92;to z&#039;" class="latex" /> which we can take to be the image of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" />.  Of course, we can also act on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%27&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f&#039;" class="latex" /> by other permutations, and likewise on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" />; but since these permutation actions are part of the structure they must be preserved by the morphism, so sending <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau%28f%27%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;tau(f&#039;)" class="latex" /> uniquely determines where we have to send all these permutation images.</p>
<p>Now you can go back and look again at John&#8217;s definition of &Sigma;-net: a set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S" class="latex" />, a groupoid <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T" class="latex" />, and a discrete opfibration <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T+%5Cto+P+S+%5Ctimes+P+S+%5E%7Bop%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T &#92;to P S &#92;times P S ^{op}" class="latex" />, where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="P" class="latex" /> denotes the free-symmetric-strict-monoidal-category functor <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathsf%7BSet%7D+%5Cto+%5Cmathsf%7BCat%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathsf{Set} &#92;to &#92;mathsf{Cat}" class="latex" />.  Such a discrete opfibration is the same as a functor <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N+%5Ccolon+P+S+%5Ctimes+P+S+%5E%7Bop%7D+%5Cto+%5Cmathsf%7BSet%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="N &#92;colon P S &#92;times P S ^{op} &#92;to &#92;mathsf{Set}" class="latex" />, and the objects of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P+S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="P S" class="latex" /> are the finite sequences of elements of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S" class="latex" /> while its morphisms are permutations; thus this is precisely a pre-net (the action of the functor <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="N" class="latex" /> on objects) with permutation actions as described above.  I won&#8217;t get into the details of constructing the adjunction relating &Sigma;-nets to symmetric monoidal categories; you can read the paper, or maybe I&#8217;ll blog about it later.</p>
<p>However, in solving the &#8220;missing morphisms&#8221; problem, we&#8217;ve introduced a new possibility.  Suppose we act on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f+%5Ccolon+%28x%2Cx%2Cy%29+%5Cto+z&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f &#92;colon (x,x,y) &#92;to z" class="latex" /> by the transposition <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csigma+%3D+%281%2C2%29+%5Cin+S_3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;sigma = (1,2) &#92;in S_3" class="latex" /> that switches the <em>first</em> two entries.  We get another transition <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2Cx%2Cy%29%5Cto+z&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(x,x,y)&#92;to z" class="latex" /> with the same domain and codomain as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" />; so it might <em>equal</em> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" />, or it might not!  In other words, transitions in a &Sigma;-net can have <em>isotropy</em>.  If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csigma%28f%29%3Df&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;sigma(f)=f" class="latex" />, then when we generate a free symmetric monoidal category from our &Sigma;-net, the corresponding morphism <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%3Ax%5Cotimes+x+%5Cotimes+y+%5Cto+z&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f:x&#92;otimes x &#92;otimes y &#92;to z" class="latex" /> will have the property that when we compose it with the symmetry morphism <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5Cotimes+x%5Cotimes+y+%5Ccong+x%5Cotimes+x%5Cotimes+y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x&#92;otimes x&#92;otimes y &#92;cong x&#92;otimes x&#92;otimes y" class="latex" /> we get back <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" /> again.  No symmetric monoidal category generated by a pre-net has this property; it&#8217;s more like the behavior of the commutative monoidal category generated by a Petri net, except that in the latter case the symmetry <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5Cotimes+x%5Cotimes+y+%5Ccong+x%5Cotimes+x%5Cotimes+y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x&#92;otimes x&#92;otimes y &#92;cong x&#92;otimes x&#92;otimes y" class="latex" /> itself <em>is</em> the identity, rather than just acting by the identity on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>This suggests that &Sigma;-nets can either &#8220;behave like pre-nets&#8221; or &#8220;behave like Petri nets&#8221;.  This is made precise by the bottom row of adjunctions in the diagram.  On one hand, we can map a pre-net to a &Sigma;-net by freely generating the action of all permutations.  This has a right adjoint that just forgets the permutation action (which actually has a further right adjoint, although that&#8217;s a bit weird).  On the other hand, we can map a Petri net to a &Sigma;-net by making all the permutations act as trivially as possible; this has a left adjoint that identifies each transition with all its permutation images.  And these adjunctions commute with the three &#8220;free monoidal category&#8221; adjunctions in reasonable ways (see the paper for details).</p>
<p>The right adjoint mapping Petri nets into &Sigma;-nets is fully faithful, so we really can say that &Sigma;-nets &#8220;include&#8221; Petri nets.  The left adjoint mapping pre-nets to &Sigma;-nets is not fully faithful&#8212;it can&#8217;t possibly be, since the whole point of introducing &Sigma;-nets was that pre-nets don&#8217;t have enough morphisms!  But the full image of this functor is equivalent to a fourth kind of net: Kock&#8217;s <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05108">whole-grain Petri nets</a>.  Kock&#8217;s approach to solving the problem of pre-nets is somewhat different, more analogous to the notion of &#8220;fat&#8221; symmetric monoidal category: he takes the domain and codomain of each transition to be a family of places indexed by a finite set.  But his category turns out to be equivalent to the category of &Sigma;-nets that are freely generated by some pre-net.  (Kock actually proved this himself, as well as sketching the adjunction between &Sigma;-nets and symmetric monoidal categories.  He called &Sigma;-nets &#8220;digraphical species&#8221;.)</p>
<p>So &Sigma;-nets &#8220;include&#8221; both Petri nets and pre-nets, in an appropriate sense.  The pre-nets (or, more precisely, whole-grain nets) are the &Sigma;-nets with free permutation actions (trivial isotropy), while the Petri nets are the &Sigma;-nets with trivial permutation actions (maximal isotropy).  In Petri-net-ese, these correspond to the &#8220;individual token philosophy&#8221; and the &#8220;collective token philosophy&#8221;, respectively.  (This makes it tempting to refer to the functors from &Sigma;-nets to pre-nets and Petri nets as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individuation">individuation</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_farming">collectivization</a> respectively.)  But &Sigma;-nets also allow us to mix and match the two philosophies, having some transitions with trivial isotropy, others with maximal isotropy, and still others with intermediate isotropy.</p>
<p>I like to think of &Sigma;-nets as a Petri net analogue of orbifolds.  Commutative-monoid-based Petri nets are like &#8220;coarse moduli spaces&#8221;, where we&#8217;ve quotiented by all symmetries but destroyed all the isotropy information; while whole-grain Petri nets are like manifolds, where we have no singularities but can only quotient by free actions.  Pre-nets can then be thought of a &#8220;presentation&#8221; of a manifold, such as by a particular way of gluing coordinate patches together: useful in concrete examples, but not the &#8220;invariant&#8221; object we really want to study mathematically.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a wonderful development!  Micah Halter and Evan Patterson have taken my work on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04630">structured cospans</a> with Kenny Courser and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05415">open Petri nets</a> with Jade Master,  together with Joachim Kock&#8217;s <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05108">whole-grain Petri nets</a>, and turned them into a practical software tool!</p>
<p>Then they used <i>that</i> to build a tool for &#8216;compositional&#8217; modeling of the spread of infectious disease.  By &#8216;compositional&#8217;, I mean that they make it easy to build more complex models by sticking together smaller, simpler models.</p>
<p>Even better, they&#8217;ve illustrated the use of this tool by rebuilding part of the model that the UK has been using to make policy decisions about COVID19.</p>
<p>All this software was written in the programming language <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_(programming_language)">Julia</a>.</p>
<p>I had expected structured cospans to be useful in programming and modeling, but I didn&#8217;t expect it to happen so fast!</p>
<p>For details, read this great article:</p>
<p>• Micah Halter and Evan Patterson, <a href="https://www.algebraicjulia.org/blog/post/2020/10/structured-cospans">Compositional epidemiological modeling using structured cospans</a>, 17 October 2020.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <strong>Abstract.</strong> The field of applied category theory (ACT) aims to put the compositionality inherent to scientific and engineering processes on a firm mathematical footing. In this post, we show how the mathematics of ACT can be operationalized to build complex epidemiological models in a compositional way. In the first two sections, we review the idea of structured cospans, a formalism for turning closed systems into open ones, and we illustrate its use in Catlab through the simple example of open graphs. Finally, we put this machinery to work in the setting of Petri nets and epidemiological models. We construct a portion of the COEXIST model for the COVID-19 pandemic and we simulate the resulting ODEs.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>  <strong>Open Petri Nets and Their Categories of Processes</strong></p>
<p><strong>Abstract.</strong> In this talk we will discuss Petri nets from a categorical perspective. A Petri net freely generates a symmetric monoidal category whose morphisms represent its executions. We will discuss how to make Petri nets &#8216;open&#8217;&#8212;i.e., equip them with input and output boundaries where resources can flow in and out. Open Petri nets freely generate open symmetric monoidal categories: symmetric monoidal categories which can be glued together along a shared boundary. The mapping from open Petri nets to their open symmetric monoidal categories is functorial and this gives a compositional framework for reasoning about the executions of Petri nets.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>
• <strong><a href="http://math.ucr/edu/home/baez/master_QPL2019.pdf">Open Petri nets</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Abstract.</strong> The reachability semantics for Petri nets can be studied using open Petri nets. For us an &#8216;open&#8217; Petri net is one with certain places designated as inputs and outputs via a cospan of sets. We can compose open Petri nets by gluing the outputs of one to the inputs of another. Open Petri nets can be treated as morphisms of a category <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathsf%7BOpen%7D%28%5Cmathsf%7BPetri%7D%29%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathsf{Open}(&#92;mathsf{Petri})," class="latex" /> which becomes symmetric monoidal under disjoint union. However, since the composite of open Petri nets is defined only up to isomorphism, it is better to treat them as morphisms of a symmetric monoidal <em>double</em> category <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BO%7D%5Cmathbf%7Bpen%7D%28%5Cmathsf%7BPetri%7D%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{O}&#92;mathbf{pen}(&#92;mathsf{Petri})." class="latex" />  Various choices of semantics for open Petri nets can be described using symmetric monoidal double functors out of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BO%7D%5Cmathbf%7Bpen%7D%28%5Cmathsf%7BPetri%7D%29.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{O}&#92;mathbf{pen}(&#92;mathsf{Petri})." class="latex" />  Here we describe the reachability semantics, which assigns to each open Petri net the relation saying which markings of the outputs can be obtained from a given marking of the inputs via a sequence of transitions. We show this semantics gives a symmetric monoidal lax double functor from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BO%7D%5Cmathbf%7Bpen%7D%28%5Cmathsf%7BPetri%7D%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{O}&#92;mathbf{pen}(&#92;mathsf{Petri})" class="latex" /> to the double category of relations. A key step in the proof is to treat Petri nets as presentations of symmetric monoidal categories; for this we use the work of Meseguer, Montanari, Sassone and others.</p></blockquote>

He&#8217;ll be working with <a href="https://www.nist.gov/people/spencer-breiner">Spencer Breiner</a> and <a href="https://engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/subrahmanian-eswaran.html">Eswaran Subrahmanian</a> on categories in engineering and system design.</p>
<p>Joe Moeller will be talking about his work on &#8216;network models&#8217; at the online category theory seminar at UNAM on Wednesday October 14th at 18:00 UTC (11 am Pacific Time):</p>
<blockquote><p>  <strong>Network Models</strong></p>
<p><strong>Abstract.</strong> Networks can be combined in various ways, such as overlaying one on top of another or setting two side by side. We introduce `network models&#8217; to encode these ways of combining networks. Different network models describe different kinds of networks. We show that each network model gives rise to an operad, whose operations are ways of assembling a network of the given kind from smaller parts. Such operads, and their algebras, can serve as tools for designing networks. Technically, a network model is a lax symmetric monoidal functor from the free symmetric monoidal category on some set to Cat, and the construction of the corresponding operad proceeds via a symmetric monoidal version of the Grothendieck construction.</p></blockquote>
