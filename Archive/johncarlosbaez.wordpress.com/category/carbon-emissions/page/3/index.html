					<p>I&#8217;m talking about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_scrubber">carbon dioxide scrubbers</a>.  This post will just be an extended quote from an excellent book, which is free online:</p>
<p>&bull; David McKay, <em><a href="http://www.withouthotair.com/Contents.html">Sustainable Energy: Without the Hot Air</a></em>.</p>
<p>It will help us begin to understand the economics.   But some numbers may have changed since this was written!   Also, the passage I&#8217;m quoting focuses on taking carbon dioxide out of the air.  This not really what I&#8217;m researching now: I&#8217;m actually interested in removing carbon dioxide from the exhaust from coal-fired power plants, at least until we manage to eliminate these plants.  But the two problems have enough similarities that it&#8217;s worth looking at the former.</p>
<p>Here is what McKay says:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>The cost of sucking</h3>
<p>Today, pumping carbon out of the ground is big bucks. In the future, perhaps pumping carbon <em>into</em> the ground is going to be big bucks. Assuming that inadequate action is taken now to halt global carbon pollution, perhaps a coalition of the willing will in a few decades pay to create a giant vacuum cleaner, and clean up everyone&rsquo;s mess.</p>
<p>Before we go into details of how to capture carbon from thin air, let&rsquo;s discuss the unavoidable energy cost of carbon capture. Whatever technologies we use, they have to respect the laws of physics, and unfortunately grabbing CO<sub>2</sub> from thin air and concentrating it requires energy. The laws of physics say that the energy required must be at least 0.2 kWh per kg of CO<sub>2</sub> (table 31.5). Given that real processes are typically 35% efficient at best, I&rsquo;d be amazed if the energy cost of carbon capture is ever reduced below 0.55 kWh per kg.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s assume that we wish to neutralize a typical European&rsquo;s CO<sub>2</sub> output of 11 tons per year, which is 30 kg per day per person. The energy required, assuming a cost of 0.55 kWh per kg of CO<sub>2</sub>, is <span class="red">16.5 kWh per day per person</span>. This is exactly the same as <span class="red">British electricity consumption</span>. So powering the giant vacuum cleaner may require us to <em>double</em> our electricity production &ndash; or at least, to somehow obtain extra power equal to our current electricity production.</p>
<p>If the cost of running giant vacuum cleaners can be brought down, brilliant, let&rsquo;s make them. But no amount of research and development can get round the laws of physics, which say that grabbing CO<sub>2</sub> from thin air and concentrating it into liquid CO<sub>2</sub> requires at least 0.2 kWh per kg of CO<sub>2</sub>. </p>
<p>Now, what&rsquo;s the best way to suck CO<sub>2</sub> from thin air?  I&rsquo;ll discuss four technologies for building the giant vacuum cleaner:</p>
<p>A. chemical pumps;<br />
B. trees;<br />
C. accelerated weathering of rocks;<br />
D. ocean nourishment.  </p>
<h3>A. Chemical technologies for carbon capture</h3>
<p>The chemical technologies typically deal with carbon dioxide in two steps.</p>
<table id="p245" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>concentrate</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>compress</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0.03% CO<sub>2</sub></td>
<td>&rarr;</td>
<td>Pure CO<sub>2</sub></td>
<td>&rarr;</td>
<td>Liquid CO<sub>2</sub></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>First, they <em>concentrate</em> CO<sub>2</sub> from its low concentration in the atmosphere; then they <em>compress</em> it into a small volume ready for shoving somewhere (either down a hole in the ground or deep in the ocean). Each of these steps has an energy cost. The costs required by the laws of physics are shown in table 31.5.</p>
<p>In 2005, the best published methods for CO<sub>2</sub> capture from thin air were quite inefficient: the energy cost was about 3.3 kWh per kg, with a financial cost of about $140 per ton of CO<sub>2</sub>. At this energy cost, capturing a European&rsquo;s 30 kg per day would cost <span class="red">100 kWh per day</span> &ndash; almost the same as the European&rsquo;s energy consumption of 125 kWh per day. Can better vacuum cleaners be designed?</p>
<p>Recently, Wallace Broecker, climate scientist, &ldquo;perhaps the world&rsquo;s foremost interpreter of the Earth&rsquo;s operation as a biological, chemical, and physical system,&rdquo; has been promoting an as yet unpublished technology developed by physicist Klaus Lackner for capturing CO<sub>2</sub> from thin air. Broecker imagines that the world could carry on burning fossil fuels at much the same rate as it does now, and 60 million CO<sub>2</sub>-scrubbers (each the size of an up-ended shipping container) will vacuum up the CO<sub>2</sub>. What energy does Lackner&rsquo;s process require? In June 2007 Lackner told me that his lab was achieving 1.3 kWh per kg, but since then they have developed a new process based on a resin that absorbs CO<sub>2</sub> when dry and releases CO<sub>2</sub> when moist. Lackner told me in June 2008 that, in a dry climate, the concentration cost has been reduced to about 0.18&ndash;0.37 kWh of low-grade heat per kg CO<sub>2</sub>. The compression cost is 0.11 kWh per kg. Thus Lackner&rsquo;s total cost is 0.48 kWh or less per kg. For a European&rsquo;s emissions of 30 kg CO<sub>2</sub> per day, we are still talking about a cost of <span class="red">14 kWh per day</span>, of which <span class="red">3.3 kWh per day</span> would be electricity, and the rest heat.</p>
<p>Hurray for technical progress! But please don&rsquo;t think that this is a small cost. We would require roughly a 20% increase in world energy production, just to run the vacuum cleaners.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3> Conclusion </h3>
<p>Okay, this is me again: John Baez.</p>
<p>If you want to read about the other methods&#8212;trees, accelerated weathering of rocks, and ocean nourishment, <a href="http://withouthotair.com/c31/page_245.shtml">go to McKay&#8217;s book</a>.  <i>I&#8217;m not saying that they are less interesting!</i>   I am not trying, in this particular series of posts, to scan all technologies and find the best ones.  I&#8217;m trying to study <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_scrubber">carbon dioxide scrubbers</a>.</p>

<a href="http://www.climeworks.com/news/"><br />
<img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.climeworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/20170510DSC_6501_PhotosbyJuliaDunlop.jpg" /></a>

<p>This article describes some recent work on &#8216;direct air capture&#8217; of carbon dioxide&#8212;essentially, sucking it out of the air:</p>
<p>• Jon Gerntner, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/magazine/climeworks-business-climate-change.html">The tiny Swiss company that thinks it can help stop climate change</a>, <em>New York Times Magazine</em>, 12 February 2019.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a Swiss company called <a href="http://www.climeworks.com/">Climeworks</a> that&#8217;s built machines that do this&#8212;shown in the picture above.  So far they are using these machines for purposes other than reducing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations: namely, making carbonated water for soft drinks, and getting greenhouses to have lots of carbon dioxide in the air, for tastier vegetables.  And they&#8217;re just experimental, not economically viable yet:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The company is not turning a profit. To build and install the 18 units at Hinwil, hand-assembled in a second-floor workshop in Zurich, cost between $3 million and $4 million, which is the primary reason it costs the firm between $500 and $600 to remove a metric ton of CO₂ from the air. Even as the company has attracted about $50 million in private investments and grants, it faces the same daunting task that confronted Carl Bosch a century ago: How much can it bring costs down? And how fast can it scale up?
</p></blockquote>
<p>If they ever make it in these markets, greenhouses and carbonation might want 6 megatonnes of CO₂ annually.  This is nothing compared to the 37 gigatonnes of CO₂ that we put into the atmosphere in 2018.  <em>In principle</em> the technology Climeworks is using could be massively scaled up.  After all, Napoleon used aluminum silverware, back when aluminum was more precious than gold&#8230; and only later did the technology for making aluminum improve to the point where the metal gained a mass market.</p>
<p>But can Climeworks&#8217; technology <em>actually</em> be scaled up?  Some are dubious:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  M.I.T.’s Howard Herzog, for instance, an engineer who has spent years looking at the potential for these machines, told me that he thinks the costs will remain between $600 and $1,000 per metric ton. Some of Herzog’s reasons for skepticism are highly technical and relate to the physics of separating gases. Some are more easily grasped. He points out that because direct-air-capture machines have to move tremendous amounts of air through a filter or solution to glean a ton of CO₂ — the gas, for all its global impact, makes up only about 0.04 percent of our atmosphere — the process necessitates large expenditures for energy and big equipment. What he has likewise observed, in analyzing similar industries that separate gases, suggests that translating spreadsheet projections for capturing CO₂ into real-world applications will reveal hidden costs. “I think there has been a lot of hype about this, and it’s not going to revolutionize anything,” he told me, adding that he thinks other negative-emissions technologies will prove cheaper. “At best it’s going to be a bit player.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>What actually <em>is</em> the technology Climeworks is using?  And what other technologies are available for sucking carbon dioxide out of the air&#8212;or out of the exhaust from fossil-fuel-burning power plants, or out of water?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll have a lot more to say about the latter question in future articles.   As for Climeworks, they describe their technology rather briefly here:</p>
<p>• Climeworks, <a href="http://www.climeworks.com/our-technology/">Our technology</a>.</p>
<p>They write:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Our plants capture atmospheric carbon with a filter. Air is drawn into the plant and the CO2 within the air is chemically bound to the filter.</p>
<p>  Once the filter is saturated with CO<sub>2</sub> it is heated (using mainly low-grade heat as an energy source) to around 100 °C (212 °F). The CO<sub>2</sub> is then released from the filter and collected as concentrated CO2 gas to supply to customers or for negative emissions technologies.</p>
<p>  CO<sub>2</sub>-free air is released back into the atmosphere. This continuous cycle is then ready to start again. The filter is reused many times and lasts for several thousand cycles.</p>
<p>  <strong>What is the filter material?</strong></p>
<p>  The filter material is made of porous granulates modified with amines, which bind the CO<sub>2</sub> in conjunction with the moisture in the air. This bond is dissolved at temperatures of 100 °C.
</p></blockquote>
<p>So, it seems their technology is an example of &#8216;amine gas treating&#8217;:</p>
<p>• Wikipedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine_gas_treating">Amine gas treating</a>.</p>
<p>In future posts I&#8217;ll talk a bit more about amine gas treating, but also other methods for absorbing carbon dioxide from air or from solution in water.  Maybe you can help me figure out what&#8217;s the best method!</p>

<blockquote><p>
  <strong>Abstract.</strong> The global warming crisis is part of a bigger transformation in which humanity realizes that the Earth is a finite system and that our population, energy usage, and the like cannot continue to grow exponentially. If civilization survives this transformation, it will affect mathematics&#8212;and be affected by it&#8212;just as dramatically as the agricultural revolution or industrial revolution. We should get ready!

				<div class="entry">
					<p>On January 25th, Jerry Brown, governor of California, gave his last annual <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2018/01/25/governor-brown-delivers-2018-state-of-the-state-address-california-is-setting-the-pace-for-america/">State of the State</a> speech.    It&#8217;s about looking forward to the future: tackling hard problems <em>now</em>.   I wish more politicians were focused on this.</p>
<p>You can see the whole speech annotated <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-jerry-brown-state-of-state-speech-transcript-20180125-story.html">here</a>.   Here is the first part.  The last line states the vision:</p>
<div align="center">
<i>The bolder path is still our way forward.</i>
</div>
<h3> State of the State (first part) </h3>
<p>Good morning. As our Constitution requires, I&#8217;m here to report on the condition of our state.</p>
<p>Simply put, California is prospering. While it faces its share of difficulties, we should never forget the bounty and the endless opportunities bestowed on this special place&#8212;or the distance we&#8217;ve all traveled together these last few years.</p>
<p>It is now hard to visualize&#8212;or even remember&#8212;the hardships, the bankruptcies and the home foreclosures so many experienced during the Great Recession. Unemployment was above 12 percent and 1.3 million Californians lost their jobs.</p>
<p>The deficit was $27 billion in 2011. The New York Times, they called us: &#8220;The Coast of Dystopia.&#8221; The Wall Street Journal saw: &#8220;The Great California Exodus.&#8221; The Economist of London pronounced us: &#8220;The Ungovernable State.&#8221; And the Business Insider simply said: &#8220;California is Doomed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even today, you will find critics who claim that the California dream is dead. But I&#8217;m used to that. Back in my first term, a prestigious report told us that California had the worst business climate in America. In point of fact, personal income in 1975, my first year as governor, was $154 billion. Today it has grown to $2.4 trillion. In just the last eight years alone, California&#8217;s personal income has grown $845 billion and 2.8 million new jobs have been created. Very few places in the world can match that record.</p>
<p>That is one of the reasons why confidence in the work that you are doing has risen so high. That contrasts sharply with the abysmal approval ratings given to the United States Congress. Certainly our on-time budgets are well received, thanks in large part to the lowering of the two-thirds vote to a simple majority to pass the budget.</p>
<p>But public confidence has also been inspired by your passing&#8212;with both Republicans and Democratic votes:</p>
<p>• Pension reform&#8212;and don’t minimize that, that was a big pension reform. May not be the final one, but it was there and you did it, Republicans and Democrats;</p>
<p>• Workers’ Compensation reform, another vote with Republicans and Democrats there;</p>
<p>• The Water Bond;</p>
<p>• The Rainy Day Fund; and</p>
<p>• The Cap-and-Trade Program.</p>
<p>And by the way, you Republicans, as I look over here and I look over there, don’t worry, I’ve got your back!</p>
<p>All these programs are big and very important to our future. And their passage demonstrates that some American governments can actually get things done&#8212;even in the face of deepening partisan division.</p>
<p>The recent fires and mudslides show us how much we are affected by natural disasters and how we can rise to the occasion&#8212;at the local level, at the state level and with major help from the federal government. I want to especially thank all of the firefighters, first responders and volunteers. They answered the call to help their fellow neighbors, in some cases even when their own homes were burning. Here we see an example of people working together irrespective of party.</p>
<p>The president himself has given California substantial assistance and the congressional leadership is now sponsoring legislation to help California, as well as the other states that have suffered major disasters&#8212;Texas, Florida and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>In this regard, we should never forget our dependency on the natural environment and the fundamental challenges it presents to the way we live. We can&#8217;t fight nature. We have to learn how to get along with her. And I want to say that again: We can&#8217;t fight nature. We have to learn how to get along with her.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s not so easy. For thousands of years this land now called California supported no more than 300,000 people. That&#8217;s 300,000 people and they did that for thousands and thousands&#8212;some people say, as long as 20,000 years. Today, 40 million people live in the same place and their sheer impact on the soils, the forests and the entire ecosystem has no long-term precedent. That&#8217;s why we have to innovate constantly and create all manner of shelter, machines and creative technologies. That will continue, but only with ever greater public and private investment.</p>
<p>The devastating forest fires and the mudslides are a profound and growing challenge. Eight of the state&#8217;s most destructive fires have occurred in the last five years. Last year&#8217;s Thomas fire in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties was the largest in recorded history. The mudslides that followed were among the most lethal the state has ever encountered. In 2017, we had the highest average summer temperatures in recorded history. Over the last 40 years, California&#8217;s fire season has increased 78 days&#8212;and in some places it is nearly year-round.</p>
<p>So we have to be ready with the necessary firefighting capability and communication systems to warn residents of impending danger. We also have to manage our forests&#8212;and soils&#8212;much more intelligently.</p>
<p>Toward that end, I will convene a task force composed of scientists and knowledgeable forest practitioners to review thoroughly the way our forests are managed and suggest ways to reduce the threat of devastating fires. They will also consider how California can increase resiliency and carbon storage capacity. Trees in California should absorb CO<sub>2</sub>, not generate huge amounts of black carbon and greenhouse gas as they do today when forest fires rage across the land.</p>
<p>Despite what is widely believed by some of the most powerful people in Washington, the science of climate change is not in doubt. The national academies of science of every major country in the world&#8212;including Russia and China&#8212;have all endorsed the mainstream view that human caused greenhouse gases are trapping heat in the oceans and in the atmosphere and that action must be taken to avert catastrophic changes in our weather systems. All nations agree except one and that is solely because of one man: our current president.</p>
<p>Here in California, we follow a different path. Enlightened by top scientists at the University of California, Stanford and Caltech, among others, our state has led the way. I&#8217;ll enumerate just how:</p>
<p>•   Building and appliance efficiency standards;</p>
<p>•   Renewable electricity&#8212;reaching 50 percent in just a few years;</p>
<p>•   A powerful low-carbon fuel standard; incentives for zero-emission vehicles;</p>
<p>•   Ambitious policies to reduce short-lived climate pollutants like methane and black carbon;</p>
<p>•   A UN sponsored climate summit this September in San Francisco; and</p>
<p>•   The nation’s only functioning cap-and-trade system.</p>
<p>I will shortly provide an expenditure plan for the revenues that the cap-and-trade auctions have generated. Your renewing this program on a bipartisan basis was a major achievement and will ensure that we will have substantial sums to invest in communities all across the state&#8212;both urban and agricultural.</p>
<p>The goal is to make our neighborhoods and farms healthier, our vehicles cleaner&#8212;zero emission the sooner the better&#8212;and all our technologies increasingly lowering their carbon output. To meet these ambitious goals, we will need five million zero-emission vehicles on the road by 2030. And we&#8217;re going to get there. Believe me. We only have 350,000 today, so we&#8217;ve all got a lot of work. And think of all the jobs and how much cleaner our air will be then.</p>
<p>When you passed cap-and-trade legislation, you also passed a far-reaching air pollution measure that for the first time focuses on pollutants that disproportionately affect specific neighborhoods. Instead of just measuring pollutants over vast swaths of land, regulators will zero in on those communities which are particularly disadvantaged by trains, trucks or factories.</p>
<p>Along with clean air, clean water is a fundamental good that must be protected and made available on a sustainable basis. When droughts occur, conservation measures become imperative. In recent years, you have passed historic legislation to manage California&#8217;s groundwater, which local governments are now implementing.</p>
<p>In addition, you passed&#8212;and more than two-thirds of voters approved&#8212;a water bond that invests in safe drinking water, conservation and storage. As a result, we will soon begin expending funds on some of the storage we&#8217;ve needed for decades.</p>
<p>As the climate changes and more water arrives as rain instead of snow, it is crucial that we are able to capture the overflow in a timely and responsible way. That, together with recycling and rainwater recapture will put us in the best position to use water wisely and in the most efficient way possible. We are also restoring the Sacramento and San Joaquin watersheds to protect water supplies and improve California&#8217;s iconic salmon runs.</p>
<p>Finally, we have the California Waterfix, a long studied and carefully designed project to modernize our broken water system. I am convinced that it will conserve water, protect the fish and the habitat in the Delta and ensure the delivery of badly needed water to the millions of people who depend on California&#8217;s aqueducts. Local water districts&#8212;in both the North and South&#8212;are providing the leadership and the financing because they know it is vital for their communities, and for the whole state. That is true, and that is the reason why I have persisted.</p>
<p>Our economy, the sixth largest in the world, depends on mobility, which only a modern and efficient transportation system provides. The vote on the gas tax was not easy but it was essential, given the vast network of roads and bridges on which California depends and the estimated $67 billion in deferred maintenance on our infrastructure. Tens of millions of cars and trucks travel over 330 billion miles a year. The sun&#8217;s only 93 million miles away.</p>
<p>The funds that SB 1 makes available are absolutely necessary if we are going to maintain our roads and transit systems in good repair. Twenty-five other states have raised gas taxes. Even the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has called for a federal gas tax because the highway trust fund is nearly broke.</p>
<p>Government does what individuals can&#8217;t do, like build roads and bridges and support local bus and light rail systems. This is our common endeavor by which we pool our resources through the public sector and improve all of our lives. Fighting a gas tax may appear to be good politics, but it isn&#8217;t. I will do everything in my power to defeat any repeal effort that gets on the ballot. You can count on that.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking for that one Republican. A brave, brave man.</p>
<p>Since I have talked about tunnels and transportation, I will bring up one more item of infrastructure: high-speed rail. I make no bones about it. I like trains and I like high-speed trains even better. So did the voters in 2008 when they approved the bond. Look, 11 other countries have high-speed trains. They are now taken for granted all over Europe, in Japan and in China. President Reagan himself said in Japan on November 11, 1983 the following, and I quote: &#8220;The State of California is planning to build a rapid speed train that is adapted from your highly successful bullet train.&#8221; Yes, we were, and now we are actually building it. Takes a long time.</p>
<p>Like any big project, there are obstacles. There were for the Bay Area Rapid Transit System, for the Golden Gate Bridge and the Panama Canal. I&#8217;ll pass over in silence the Bay bridge, that was almost 20 years. And by the way, it was over budget by $6 billion on a $1 billion project. So that happens. But not with the high-speed rail, we&#8217;ve got that covered.</p>
<p>But build it they did and build it we will&#8212;America&#8217;s first high-speed rail system. One link between San Jose and San Francisco&#8212;an electrified Caltrain&#8212;is financed and ready to go. Another billion, with matching funds, will be invested in Los Angeles to improve Union Station as a major transportation hub and fix the Anaheim corridor.</p>
<p>The next step is completing the Valley segment and getting an operating system connected to San Jose. Yes, it costs lots of money but it is still cheaper and more convenient than expanding airports, which nobody wants to, and building new freeways, which landowners often object to. All of that is to meet the growing demand. It will be fast, quiet and powered by renewable electricity and last for a hundred years. After all you guys are gone.</p>
<p>Already, more than 1,500 construction workers are on the job at 17 sites and hundreds of California businesses are providing services, generating thousands of job years of employment. As the global economy puts more Americans out of work and lowers wages, infrastructure projects like this will be a key source of well-paid California jobs.</p>
<p>Difficulties challenge us but they can&#8217;t discourage or stop us. Whether it&#8217;s roads or trains or dams or renewable energy installations or zero-emission cars, California is setting the pace for the entire nation. Yes, there are critics, there are lawsuits and there are countless obstacles. But California was built on dreams and perseverance and the bolder path is still our way forward.</p>
<h3> What&#8217;s next? </h3>
<p>On January 26th, the governor&#8217;s office made this announcement:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Taking action to further California’s climate leadership, Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today signed an executive order to boost the supply of zero-emission vehicles and charging and refueling stations in California. The Governor also detailed the new plan for investing $1.25 billion in cap-and-trade auction proceeds to reduce carbon pollution and improve public health and the environment.</p>
<p>  “This executive order aims to curb carbon pollution from cars and trucks and boost the number of zero-emission vehicles driven in California,” said Governor Brown. “In addition, the cap-and-trade investments will, in varying degrees, reduce California’s carbon footprint and improve the quality of life for all.”</p>
<p>  <b>Zero-Emission Vehicle Executive Order</b></p>
<p>  California is taking action to dramatically reduce carbon emissions from transportation&#8212;a sector that accounts for 50 percent of the state’s greenhouse gas emissions and 80 percent of smog-forming pollutants.</p>
<p>  To continue to meet California’s climate goals and clean air standards, California must go even further to accelerate the market for zero-emission vehicles. Today’s executive order implements the Governor’s call for a new target of 5 million ZEVs in California by 2030, announced in his State of the State address yesterday, and will help significantly expand vehicle charging infrastructure.</p>
<p>  The Administration is also proposing a new eight-year initiative to continue the state’s clean vehicle rebates and spur more infrastructure investments. This $2.5 billion initiative will help bring 250,000 vehicle charging stations and 200 hydrogen fueling stations to California by 2025.</p>
<p>  Today’s action builds on past efforts to boost zero-emission vehicles, including: legislation signed last year and in 2014 and 2013; adopting the 2016 Zero-Emission Vehicle Plan and the Advanced Clean Cars program; hosting a Zero-Emission Vehicle Summit; launching a multi-state ZEV Action Plan; co-founding the International ZEV Alliance; and issuing Executive Order B-16-12 in 2012 to help bring 1.5 million zero-emission vehicles to California by 2025.</p>
<p>  In addition to today’s executive order, the Governor also released the 2018 plan for California’s Climate Investments&#8212;a statewide initiative that puts billions of cap-and-trade dollars to work reducing greenhouse gas emissions, strengthening the economy and improving public health and the environment–particularly in disadvantaged communities.</p>
<p>  California Climate Investments projects include affordable housing, renewable energy, public transportation, zero-emission vehicles, environmental restoration, more sustainable agriculture and recycling, among other projects. At least 35 percent of these investments are made in disadvantaged and low-income communities.</p>

				<small>17 January, 2017</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>The president of the US recently came out with an article in <em>Science</em>.   It&#8217;s about climate change and clean energy:</p>
<p>&bull; Barack Obama, <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/355/6321/126.full">The irreversible momentum of clean energy</a>, <em>Science</em>, 13 January 2017.</p>
<p>Since it&#8217;s open-access, I&#8217;m going to take the liberty of quoting the whole thing, minus the references, which provide support for a lot of his facts and figures.</p>
<h3> The irreversible momentum of clean energy </h3>
<p>The release of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases (GHGs) due to human activity is increasing global average surface air temperatures, disrupting weather patterns, and acidifying the ocean. Left unchecked, the continued growth of GHG emissions could cause global average temperatures to increase by another 4°C or more by 2100 and by 1.5 to 2 times as much in many midcontinent and far northern locations. Although our understanding of the impacts of climate change is increasingly and disturbingly clear, there is still debate about the proper course for U.S. policy — a debate that is very much on display during the current presidential transition. But putting near-term politics aside, the mounting economic and scientific evidence leave me confident that trends toward a clean-energy economy that have emerged during my presidency will continue and that the economic opportunity for our country to harness that trend will only grow. This Policy Forum will focus on the four reasons I believe the trend toward clean energy is irreversible.</p>
<p><strong>ECONOMIES GROW, EMISSIONS FALL</strong></p>
<p>The United States is showing that GHG mitigation need not conflict with economic growth. Rather, it can boost efficiency, productivity, and innovation. Since 2008, the United States has experienced the first sustained period of rapid GHG emissions reductions and simultaneous economic growth on record. Specifically, CO2 emissions from the energy sector fell by 9.5% from 2008 to 2015, while the economy grew by more than 10%. In this same period, the amount of energy consumed per dollar of real gross domestic product (GDP) fell by almost 11%, the amount of CO2 emitted per unit of energy consumed declined by 8%, and CO2 emitted per dollar of GDP declined by 18%.</p>
<p>The importance of this trend cannot be overstated. This “decoupling”  of energy sector emissions and economic growth should put to rest the argument that combatting climate change requires accepting lower growth or a lower standard of living. In fact, although this decoupling is most pronounced in the United States, evidence that economies can grow while emissions do not is emerging around the world. The International Energy Agency’s (IEA’s) preliminary estimate of energy related CO2 emissions in 2015 reveals that emissions stayed flat compared with the year before, whereas the global economy grew. The IEA noted that “There have been only four periods in the past 40 years in which CO2 emission levels were flat or fell compared with the previous year, with three of those — the early 1980s, 1992, and 2009 — being associated with global economic weakness. By contrast, the recent halt in emissions growth comes in a period of economic growth.”</p>
<p>At the same time, evidence is mounting that any economic strategy that ignores carbon pollution will impose tremendous costs to the global economy and will result in fewer jobs and less economic growth over the long term. Estimates of the economic damages from warming of 4°C over preindustrial levels range from 1% to 5% of global GDP each year by 2100. One of the most frequently cited economic models pins the estimate of annual damages from warming of 4°C at ~4% of global GDP, which could lead to lost U.S. federal revenue of roughly $340 billion to $690 billion annually.</p>
<p>Moreover, these estimates do not include the possibility of GHG increases triggering catastrophic events, such as the accelerated shrinkage of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, drastic changes in ocean currents, or sizable releases of GHGs from previously frozen soils and sediments that rapidly accelerate warming. In addition, these estimates factor in economic damages but do not address the critical question of whether the underlying rate of economic growth (rather than just the level of GDP) is affected by climate change, so these studies could substantially understate the potential damage of climate change on the global macroeconomy.</p>
<p>As a result, it is becoming increasingly clear that, regardless of the inherent uncertainties in predicting future climate and weather patterns, the investments needed to reduce emissions — and to increase resilience and preparedness for the changes in climate that can no longer be avoided — will be modest in comparison with the benefits from avoided climate-change damages.  This means, in the coming years, states, localities, and businesses will need to continue making these critical investments, in addition to taking common-sense steps to disclose climate risk to taxpayers, homeowners, shareholders, and customers.  Global insurance and reinsurance businesses are already taking such steps as their analytical models reveal growing climate risk.</p>
<p><strong>PRIVATE-SECTOR EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS</strong></p>
<p>Beyond the macroeconomic case, businesses are coming to the conclusion that reducing emissions is not just good for the environment — it can also boost bottom lines, cut costs for consumers, and deliver returns for shareholders.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most compelling example is energy efficiency. Government has played a role in encouraging this kind of investment and innovation.  My Administration has put in place (i) fuel economy standards that are net beneficial and are projected to cut more than 8 billion tons of carbon pollution over the lifetime of new vehicles sold between 2012 and 2029 and (ii) 44 appliance standards and new building codes that are projected to cut 2.4 billion tons of carbon pollution and save $550 billion for consumers by 2030.</p>
<p>But ultimately, these investments are being made by firms that decide to cut their energy waste in order to save money and invest in other areas of their businesses. For example, Alcoa has set a goal of reducing its GHG intensity 30% by 2020 from its 2005 baseline, and General Motors is working to reduce its energy intensity from facilities by 20% from its 2011 baseline over the same timeframe. Investments like these are contributing to what we are seeing take place across the economy: Total energy consumption in 2015 was 2.5% lower than it was in 2008, whereas the economy was 10% larger.</p>
<p>This kind of corporate decision-making can save money, but it also has the potential to create jobs that pay well. A U.S. Department of Energy report released this week found that ~2.2 million Americans are currently employed in the design, installation, and manufacture of energy-efficiency products and services. This compares with the roughly 1.1 million Americans who are employed in the production of fossil fuels and their use for electric power generation. Policies that continue to encourage businesses to save money by cutting energy waste could pay a major employment dividend and are based on stronger economic logic than continuing the nearly $5 billion per year in federal fossil-fuel subsidies, a market distortion that should be corrected on its own or in the context of corporate tax reform.</p>
<p><strong>MARKET FORCES IN THE POWER SECTOR</strong></p>
<p>The American electric-power sector — the largest source of GHG emissions in our economy — is being transformed, in large part, because of market dynamics. In 2008, natural gas made up ~21% of U.S. electricity generation. Today, it makes up ~33%, an increase due almost entirely to the shift from higher-emitting coal to lower-emitting natural gas, brought about primarily by the increased availability of low-cost gas due to new production techniques. Because the cost of new electricity generation using natural gas is projected to remain low relative to coal, it is unlikely that utilities will change course and choose to build coal-fired power plants, which would be more expensive than natural gas plants, regardless of any near-term changes in federal policy. Although methane emissions from natural gas production are a serious concern, firms have an economic incentive over the long term to put in place waste-reducing measures consistent with standards my Administration has put in place, and states will continue making important progress toward addressing this issue, irrespective of near-term federal policy.</p>
<p>Renewable electricity costs also fell dramatically between 2008 and 2015: the cost of electricity fell 41% for wind, 54% for rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) installations, and 64% for utility-scale PV. According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, 2015 was a record year for clean energy investment, with those energy sources attracting twice as much global capital as fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Public policy — ranging from Recovery Act investments to recent tax credit extensions — has played a crucial role, but technology advances and market forces will continue to drive renewable deployment.  The levelized cost of electricity from new renewables like wind and solar in some parts of the United States is already lower than that for new coal generation, without counting subsidies for renewables.</p>
<p>That is why American businesses are making the move toward renewable energy sources. Google, for example, announced last month that, in 2017, it plans to power 100% of its operations using renewable energy — in large part through large-scale, long-term contracts to buy renewable energy directly. Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, has set a goal of getting 100% of its energy from renewables in the coming years. And economy-wide, solar and wind firms now employ more than 360,000 Americans, compared with around 160,000 Americans who work in coal electric generation and support.</p>
<p>Beyond market forces, state-level policy will continue to drive clean-energy momentum. States representing 40% of the U.S. population are continuing to move ahead with clean-energy plans, and even outside of those states, clean energy is expanding. For example, wind power alone made up 12% of Texas’s electricity production in 2015 and, at certain points in 2015, that number was &gt;40%, and wind provided 32% of Iowa’s total electricity generation in 2015, up from 8% in 2008 (a higher fraction than in any other state).</p>
<p><strong>GLOBAL MOMENTUM</strong></p>
<p>Outside the United States, countries and their businesses are moving forward, seeking to reap benefits for their countries by being at the front of the clean-energy race.  This has not always been the case. A short time ago, many believed that only a small number of advanced economies should be responsible for reducing GHG emissions and contributing to the fight against climate change. But nations agreed in Paris that all countries should put forward increasingly ambitious climate policies and be subject to consistent transparency and accountability requirements. This was a fundamental shift in the diplomatic landscape, which has already yielded substantial dividends. The Paris Agreement entered into force in less than a year, and, at the follow-up meeting this fall in Marrakesh, countries agreed that, with more than 110 countries representing more than 75% of global emissions having already joined the Paris Agreement, climate action “momentum is irreversible”. Although substantive action over decades will be required to realize the vision of Paris, analysis of countries’ individual contributions suggests that meeting mediumterm respective targets and increasing their ambition in the years ahead — coupled with scaled-up investment in clean-energy technologies — could increase the international community’s probability of limiting warming to 2°C by as much as 50%.</p>
<p>Were the United States to step away from Paris, it would lose its seat at the table to hold other countries to their commitments, demand transparency, and encourage ambition. This does not mean the next Administration needs to follow identical domestic policies to my Administration’s. There are multiple paths and mechanisms by which this country can achieve — efficiently and economically — the targets we embraced in the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement itself is based on a nationally determined structure whereby each country sets and updates its own commitments. Regardless of U.S. domestic policies, it would undermine our economic interests to walk away from the opportunity to hold countries representing two-thirds of global emissions — including China, India, Mexico, European Union members, and others — accountable. This should not be a partisan issue. It is good business and good economics to lead a technological revolution and define market trends. And it is smart planning to set long term emission-reduction targets and give American companies, entrepreneurs, and investors certainty so they can invest and manufacture the emission-reducing technologies that we can use domestically and export to the rest of the world. That is why hundreds of major companies — including energy-related companies from ExxonMobil and Shell, to DuPont and Rio Tinto, to Berkshire Hathaway Energy, Calpine, and Pacific Gas and Electric Company — have supported the Paris process, and leading investors have committed $1 billion in patient, private capital to support clean-energy breakthroughs that could make even greater climate ambition possible.</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>We have long known, on the basis of a massive scientific record, that the urgency of acting to mitigate climate change is real and cannot be ignored. In recent years, we have also seen that the economic case for action — and against inaction — is just as clear, the business case for clean energy is growing, and the trend toward a cleaner power sector can be sustained regardless of near-term federal policies.</p>
<p>Despite the policy uncertainty that we face, I remain convinced that no country is better suited to confront the climate challenge and reap the economic benefits of a low-carbon future than the United States and that continued participation in the Paris process will yield great benefit for the American people, as well as the international community. Prudent U.S. policy over the next several decades would prioritize, among other actions, decarbonizing the U.S. energy system, storing carbon and reducing emissions within U.S. lands, and reducing non-CO2 emissions.</p>
<p>Of course, one of the great advantages of our system of government is that each president is able to chart his or her own policy course. And President-elect Donald Trump will have the opportunity to do so. The latest science and economics provide a helpful guide for what the future may bring, in many cases independent of near-term policy choices, when it comes to combatting climate change and transitioning to a clean energy economy.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve been busy backing up climate data before Trump becomes President. Now you can help too, with some money to pay for servers and storage space.   Please give what you can at our Kickstarter campaign here:</p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/592742410/azimuth-climate-data-backup-project">Azimuth Climate Data Backup Project</a>.</p>
<p>If we get $5000 by the end of January, we can save this data until we convince bigger organizations to take over.   If we don&#8217;t get that much, we get nothing.  That&#8217;s how Kickstarter works.  Also, if you donate now, you won&#8217;t be billed until January 31st.</p>
<p>So, please help!   It&#8217;s urgent.</p>
<p>I will make public how we spend this money.  And if we get more than $5000, I&#8217;ll make sure it&#8217;s put to good use.  There&#8217;s a lot of work we could do to make sure the data is authenticated, made easily accessible, and so on.</p>
<h3> The idea </h3>
<p>The safety of US government climate data is at risk. Trump plans to have climate change deniers running every agency concerned with climate change.  So, scientists are rushing to back up the many climate databases held by US government agencies before he takes office.</p>
<p>We hope he won&#8217;t be rash enough to delete these precious records. But: <i>better safe than sorry!</i></p>
<p>The <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/azimuth_backup_project/">Azimuth Climate Data Backup Project</a> is part of this effort. So far our volunteers have backed up nearly 1 terabyte of climate data from NASA and other agencies. We&#8217;ll do a lot more!  We just need some funds to pay for storage space and a server until larger institutions take over this task.</p>
<h3> The team</h3>
<p>• <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Jan+Galkowski">Jan Galkowski</a> is a statistician with a strong interest in climate science. He works at Akamai Technologies, a company responsible for serving at least 15% of all web traffic. He began downloading climate data on the 11th of December.</p>
<p>• Shortly thereafter <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/">John Baez</a>, a mathematician and science blogger at U. C. Riverside, joined in to publicize the project. He’d already founded an organization called the Azimuth Project, which helps scientists and engineers cooperate on environmental issues.</p>
<p>• When Jan started running out of storage space, <a href="https://plus.google.com/112648317373638762082">Scott Maxwell</a> jumped in. He used to work for NASA&#8212;driving a Mars rover among other things&#8212;and now he works for Google. He set up a 10-terabyte account on Google Drive and started backing up data himself.</p>
<p>• A couple of days later <a href="https://plus.google.com/+SakariMaaranen/about">Sakari Maaranen</a> joined the team. He’s a systems architect at Ubisecure, a Finnish firm, with access to a high-bandwidth connection. He set up a server, he&#8217;s downloading lots of data, he showed us how to authenticate it with SHA-256 hashes, and he&#8217;s managing many other technical aspects of this project.</p>
<p>There are other people involved too.  You can watch the nitty-gritty details of our progress here:</p>

					<div align="center"><a href="http://under2mou.org/"><img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/under2mou.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Under2MOU_logo_tagline-2016.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking hard about climate change since at least 2010.  That&#8217;s why I started this blog.  But the last couple years I&#8217;ve focused on basic research in <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/">network theory</a> as a preliminary step toward <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/networks_1.html">green mathematics</a>.  Basic research is what I&#8217;m best at, and there are plenty of people working on the more immediate, more urgent aspects of climate change.</p>
<p>Indeed, after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement">Paris Agreement</a>, I started hoping that politicians were taking this issue seriously and that we&#8217;d ultimately deal with it&#8212;even though I knew this agreement was not itself enough to keep warming below 2° C:</p>
<blockquote><p>
There is a troubling paradox at the heart of climate policy.  On the one hand, nobody can doubt the historic success of the Paris Agreement. On the other hand, everybody willing to look can see the impact of our changing climate. People already face rising seas, expanding desertification and coastal erosion. They take little comfort from agreements to adopt mitigation measures and finance adaptation in the future. They need action today.</p>
<p>That is why the <a href="http://web.unep.org/emissionsgap/">Emissions Gap Report</a> tracks our progress in restricting global warming to 1.5 &#8211; 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by the end of this century. This year’s data shows that overall emissions are still rising, but more slowly, and in the case of carbon dioxide, hardly at all. The report foresees further reductions in the short term and increased ambition in the medium term. Make no mistake; the Paris Agreement will slow climate change. The recent <a href="www.nytimes.com/2016/10/15/world/africa/kigali-deal-hfc-air-conditioners.html">Kigali Amendment</a> to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Protocol">Montreal Protocol</a> will do the same.</p>
<p>But not enough: not nearly enough and not fast enough. This report estimates we are actually on track for global warming of up to 3.4 degrees Celsius. Current commitments will reduce emissions by no more than a third of the levels required by 2030 to avert disaster. The Kigali Amendment will take off 0.5 degrees Celsius, although not until well after 2030. Action on short-lived climate pollutants, such as black carbon, can take off a further 0.5 degrees Celsius. This means we need to find another one degree from somewhere to meet the stronger, and safer, target of 1.5 degrees Celsius warming.</p>
<p>So, we must take urgent action. If we don’t, we will mourn the loss of biodiversity and natural resources. We will regret the economic fallout. Most of all, we will grieve over the avoidable human tragedy; the growing numbers of climate refugees hit by hunger, poverty, illness and conflict will be a constant reminder of our failure to deliver.
</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s from an annual report put out by the <a href="http://www.unep.org/">United Nations Environment Programme</a>, or <strong>UNEP</strong>:</p>
<p>• United Nations Environment Programme, <i><a href="http://capacity4dev.ec.europa.eu/unep/document/emissions-gap-report-2016-unep-synthesis-report">The Emissions Gap Report 2016</a></i>.</p>
<p>As this report makes clear, we <i>can</i> bridge the gap and keep global warming below 2&deg; C, if we work very hard.</p>
<p>But my limited optimism was shaken by the US presidential election, and especially by the choice of  <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/117663015413546257905/posts/1tKE8kik9sx">Myron Ebell</a> to head the &#8216;transition team&#8217; for the Environmental Protection Agency.   For the US government to dismantle the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_Power_Plan">Clean Power Plan</a> and abandon the Paris Agreement would seriously threaten the fight against climate change.</p>
<p>Luckily, people already recognize that even <i>with</i> the Paris Agreement, a lot of work must happen at the &#8216;subnational&#8217; level.  This work will go on even if the US federal government gives up.  So I want to learn more about it, and get involved somehow.</p>
<p>This is where the Under2 Coalition comes in.</p>
<h3>The Under2 Coalition</h3>
<p>California, Connecticut, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington have signed onto a spinoff of the Paris Climate Agreement.  It&#8217;s called the <a href="http://under2mou.org/the-mou/">Under2 Memorandum of Understanding</a>, or <b>Under2 MOU</b> for short.</p>
<p>&#8220;Under 2&#8221; stands for two goals:</p>
<p>• under 2 degrees Celsius of global warming, and<br />
• under 2 tonnes of carbon dioxide emitted per person per year.</p>
<p>These states have agreed to cut greenhouse gas emissions to 80-95% below 1990 levels by 2050.  They&#8217;ve also agreed to share technology and scientific research, expand use of zero-emission vehicles, etc., etc.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s not just US states that are involved in this!  A total of 165 jurisdictions in 33 countries and six continents have signed or endorsed the Under2 MOU. Together, they form the <b>Under2 Coalition</b>.   They represent more than 1.08 billion people and $25.7 trillion in GDP, more than a third of the global economy:</p>
<p>• <a href="http://under2mou.org/coalition/">Under2 Coalition</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll list the members, starting with ones near the US.  If you go to the link you can find out exactly what each of these &#8216;sub-national entities&#8217; are promising to do.   In a future post, I&#8217;ll say more about the details, since I want Riverside to join this coalition.  Jim Stuttard has already started a page about a city in the UK which is not a member of the Under2 Coalition, but has done a lot of work to figure out how to cut carbon emissions:</p>
<p>• Azimuth Wiki, <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Birmingham+Green+Commission">Birmingham Green Commission</a>.</p>

</a></div>
<p>About a year ago, the <a href="http://www.iea.org/">International Energy Agency</a> announced some important news.  Although the global GDP grew by 3.4% in 2014, greenhouse gas emissions due to energy use did not increase!   We spewed 32.3 gigtonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere by burning stuff to produce energy&#8212;just as we had in 2013.</p>
<p>Of course, leveling off is not good enough.  Since <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Carbon+is+forever">carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere essentially &#8216;forever&#8217;</a>, we need to essentially <em>quit</em> burning stuff.  You can&#8217;t stop a clogged sink from overflowing by <em>levelling off</em> the rate at which you pour in water.  You have to <em>turn off the faucet!</em></p>
<p>But still, it&#8217;s a promising start.</p>
<p>And now the IEA is saying the same thing about 2015.  While the global GDP grew 3.1% in 2015, we spewed just 32.1 billion gigatonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> into the air by burning stuff to make energy.  So these carbon emissions are flat or even slightly down from 2014!</p>
<p>The IEA put out a press release about this:</p>
<p>&bull; International Energy Agency, <a href="http://www.iea.org/newsroomandevents/pressreleases/2016/march/decoupling-of-global-emissions-and-economic-growth-confirmed.html">Decoupling of global emissions and economic growth confirmed</a>, 16 March 2016.</p>
<p>and here is some of what it says:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The new figures confirm last year’s surprising but welcome news: we now have seen two straight years of greenhouse gas emissions decoupling from economic growth,” said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol. “Coming just a few months after the landmark COP21 agreement in Paris, this is yet another boost to the global fight against climate change.”</p>
<p>  Global emissions of carbon dioxide stood at 32.1 billion tonnes in 2015, having remained essentially flat since 2013. The IEA preliminary data suggest that electricity generated by renewables played a critical role, having accounted for around 90% of new electricity generation in 2015; wind alone produced more than half of new electricity generation. In parallel, the global economy continued to grow by more than 3%, offering further evidence that the link between economic growth and emissions growth is weakening.</p>
<p>  In the more than 40 years in which the IEA has been providing information on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, there have been only four periods in which emissions stood still or fell compared to the previous year. Three of those&#8212;the early 1980s, 1992 and 2009&#8212;were associated with global economic weakness. But the recent stall in emissions comes amid economic expansion: according to the International Monetary Fund, global GDP grew by 3.4% in 2014 and 3.1% in 2015.</p>
<p>  The two largest emitters, China and the United States, both registered a decline in energy-related CO<sub>2</sub> in 2015. In China, emissions declined by 1.5%, as coal use dropped for the second year in a row. The economic restructuring towards less energy-intensive industries and the government’s efforts to decarbonise electricity generation pushed coal use down. In 2015, coal generated less than 70% of Chinese electricity, ten percentage points less than four years ago (in 2011). Over the same period low-carbon sources jumped from 19% to 28%, with hydro and wind accounting for most of the increase. In the United States, emissions declined by 2%, as a large switch from coal to natural gas use in electricity generation took place.</p>
<p>  The decline observed in the two major emitters was offset by increasing emissions in most other Asian developing economies and the Middle East, and also a moderate increase in Europe.</p>
<p>  More details on the data and analysis will be included in a World Energy Outlook special report on energy and air quality that will be released at the end of June. The report will go beyond CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and will provide a first in-depth analysis of the role the energy sector plays in air pollution, a crucial policy issue that today results in 7 million premature deaths a year. The report will provide the outlook for emissions and their impact on health, and provide policy makers with strategies to mitigate energy-related air pollution in the short and long term.</p>

<h3>Decarbonization since the Paris Agreement</h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s an optimistic assessment of what&#8217;s been going since the Paris Agreement was sealed on 12 December 2015:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/blog-post/2451682/paris-agreement-100-days-on-the-dawn-of-a-new-era?utm_source=Daily+Carbon+Briefing&amp;utm_campaign=9b3488b6fa-cb_daily&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_876aab4fd7-9b3488b6fa-303441369">Paris Agreement 100 days on: The dawn of a new era?</a>, <i>BusinessGreen</i>, 21 March 2016.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s mainly interesting to me because it has a passage with lots of links.  I&#8217;ll quote that part:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Just days after the agreement, the Obama administration pulled off another coup <a href="http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/analysis/2439960/us-poised-for-renewables-boom-following-tax-credit-extension">extending renewable energy tax credits</a> and effectively engineering an acceleration of the country&#8217;s renewable energy boom. China followed a few months later with a <a href="http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/analysis/2449912/china-promises-to-slash-energy-consumption-in-new-five-year-plan-dedicated-to-greener-growth">Five Year Plan that majored on environmental progress</a> and further fuelled speculation the superpower&#8217;s coal use has already peaked. Canada continued its rehabilitation from climate villain to climate champion, inking a <a href="http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/2450209/us-and-canada-join-forces-for-fresh-climate-action-push" target="_blank">comprehensive bilateral agreement</a> with the US to crackdown on methane emissions and put another stake through the heart of Arctic drilling plans. <a href="http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/feature/2448771/can-sweden-really-deliver-on-its-carbon-neutral-goal">Sweden edged forward</a> with plans for a carbon neutral economy, as <a href="http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/2451065/japan-details-plan-for-post-paris-agreement-carbon-cuts" target="_blank" title="Japan details plan for post-Paris Agreement carbon cuts">Japan revealed plans</a> to accelerate its emission reductions through to 2030. And the UK government, sadly still a byword for climate policy contrariness, revealed it would take the over-arching goal of the Paris Agreement and enshrine it in national law through a <a href="http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/2450973/government-confirms-zero-emission-paris-goal-to-be-enshrined-in-law" target="_blank">new target to build a net zero emission economy</a>.</p>
<p>This global policy push, coupled with inexorable technological progress (witness the latest record-breaking solar cells and the blistering pace of improvements in energy storage technology), is working. Just weeks after the Paris Agreement the clean energy investment and greenhouse gas emission data for 2015 started to come in, and the stats were better than anyone could have expected. Clean energy investment <a href="http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/2441828/clean-energy-attracts-record-usd329bn-investment-despite-fossil-fuel-price-crash">reached a record $329bn</a>, as it became increasingly clear renewables are now the generation option of choice in multiple markets around the world. In industrialised countries such as the UK emissions <a href="http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/analysis/2444871/official-uk-emissions-down-35-per-cent-since-1990">kept falling fast</a>, while the <a href="http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/2451196/iea-confirms-decoupling-of-emissions-and-economic-growth">IEA suggested emissions globally are remaining flat</a>, despite increasing wealth.</p>
<p>These mega trends are inevitably being felt at the coal face, so to speak, of modern business. Since Paris, US coal giant <a href="http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/2441199/arch-coal-files-for-bankruptcy-in-bid-to-tackle-usd45bn-debt-mountain">Arch Coal filed for bankruptcy</a> and <a href="http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/2451406/peabody-energy-warns-of-latest-coal-bankruptcy-risk">Peabody Energy warned it may have to do the same</a>. In the UK, mainstream energy trade body Energy UK delivered its own Road to Damascus moment, announcing its members were <a href="http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/analysis/2448205/energy-executives-reveal-readiness-for-low-carbon-transition">primed and ready to deliver a low carbon transition</a>. Iberdrola, one of the few European utilities closely associated with a full bore commitment to decarbonisation, became one of the few European utilities to <a href="http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/2448525/wind-investments-power-uptick-in-iberdrola-profits">report decent financial results</a>. The march of the divestment movement continued, as savvy investors all over the world have internalised the logic of the Paris Agreement&#8217;s goals and recognised that carbon intensive business models&#8217; days are numbered. The flight from high risk coal assets gathered pace, just as the development of high risk oil assets slowed.

<p>The video here is quite gripping: you should watch it!</p>
<p>Despite the title, Gore starts with a long and terrifying account of what climate change is doing.   So what&#8217;s his case for optimism?  A lot of it concerns solar power, though he also mentions nuclear power:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  So the answer to the first question, &#8220;Must we change?&#8221; is yes, we have to change. Second question, &#8220;Can we change?&#8221; This is the exciting news! The best projections in the world 16 years ago were that by 2010, the world would be able to install 30 gigawatts of wind capacity. We beat that mark by 14 and a half times over. We see an exponential curve for wind installations now. We see the cost coming down dramatically. Some countries&#8212;take Germany, an industrial powerhouse with a climate not that different from Vancouver&#8217;s, by the way&#8212;one day last December, got 81 percent of all its energy from renewable resources, mainly solar and wind. A lot of countries are getting more than half on an average basis.</p>
<p>  More good news: energy storage, from batteries particularly, is now beginning to take off because the cost has been coming down very dramatically to solve the intermittency problem. With solar, the news is even more exciting! The best projections 14 years ago were that we would install one gigawatt per year by 2010. When 2010 came around, we beat that mark by 17 times over. Last year, we beat it by 58 times over. This year, we&#8217;re on track to beat it 68 times over.</p>
<p>  We&#8217;re going to win this. We are going to prevail. The exponential curve on solar is even steeper and more dramatic. When I came to this stage 10 years ago, this is where it was. We have seen a revolutionary breakthrough in the emergence of these exponential curves.</p>
<p>  And the cost has come down 10 percent per year for 30 years. And it&#8217;s continuing to come down.</p>
<p>  Now, the business community has certainly noticed this, because it&#8217;s crossing the grid parity point. Cheaper solar penetration rates are beginning to rise. Grid parity is understood as that line, that threshold, below which renewable electricity is cheaper than electricity from burning fossil fuels. That threshold is a little bit like the difference between 32 degrees Fahrenheit and 33 degrees Fahrenheit, or zero and one Celsius. It&#8217;s a difference of more than one degree, it&#8217;s the difference between ice and water. And it&#8217;s the difference between markets that are frozen up, and liquid flows of capital into new opportunities for investment. This is the biggest new business opportunity in the history of the world, and two-thirds of it is in the private sector. We are seeing an explosion of new investment. Starting in 2010, investments globally in renewable electricity generation surpassed fossils. The gap has been growing ever since. The projections for the future are even more dramatic, even though fossil energy is now still subsidized at a rate 40 times larger than renewables. And by the way, if you add the projections for nuclear on here, particularly if you assume that the work many are doing to try to break through to safer and more acceptable, more affordable forms of nuclear, this could change even more dramatically.</p>
<p>  So is there any precedent for such a rapid adoption of a new technology? Well, there are many, but let&#8217;s look at cell phones. In 1980, AT&amp;T, then Ma Bell, commissioned McKinsey to do a global market survey of those clunky new mobile phones that appeared then. &#8220;How many can we sell by the year 2000?&#8221; they asked. McKinsey came back and said, &#8220;900,000.&#8221; And sure enough, when the year 2000 arrived, they did sell 900,000&#8212;in the first three days. And for the balance of the year, they sold 120 times more. And now there are more cell connections than there are people in the world.</p>
<p>  So, why were they not only wrong, but way wrong? I&#8217;ve asked that question myself, &#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>  And I think the answer is in three parts. First, the cost came down much faster than anybody expected, even as the quality went up. And low-income countries, places that did not have a landline grid&#8212;they leap-frogged to the new technology. The big expansion has been in the developing counties. So what about the electricity grids in the developing world? Well, not so hot. And in many areas, they don&#8217;t exist. There are more people without any electricity at all in India than the entire population of the United States of America. So now we&#8217;re getting this: solar panels on grass huts and new business models that make it affordable. Muhammad Yunus financed this one in Bangladesh with micro-credit. This is a village market. Bangladesh is now the fastest-deploying country in the world: two systems per minute on average, night and day. And we have all we need: enough energy from the Sun comes to the Earth every hour to supply the full world&#8217;s energy needs for an entire year. It&#8217;s actually a little bit less than an hour. So the answer to the second question, &#8220;Can we change?&#8221; is clearly &#8220;Yes.&#8221; And it&#8217;s an ever-firmer &#8220;yes.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Some people are much less sanguine about solar power, and they would point out all the things that Gore doesn&#8217;t mention here.  For example, while Gore claims that &#8220;one day last December&#8221; Germany &#8220;got 81 percent of all its energy from renewable resources, mainly solar and wind&#8221;, the picture in general is not so good:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.energiewende2015.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Factsheet-Renewables-from-Germany.pdf"><br />
<img width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ecological/german_electric_power_2014.jpg" /><br />
</a></p>
<p>This is from 2014, the most recent I could easily find.  At least back then, renewables were only slightly ahead of &#8216;brown coal&#8217;, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lignite">lignite</a>&#8212;the dirtiest kind of coal.  Furthermore, among renewables, burning &#8216;biomass&#8217; produced about as much power as wind&#8212;and more than solar.  And what&#8217;s &#8216;biomass&#8217;, exactly?  A lot of it is wood pellets!  Some is even imported:</p>
<p>&bull; John Baez, <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2013/09/18/the-eus-biggest-renewable-energy-source/">The EU&#8217;s biggest renewable eneergy source</a>, 18 September 2013.</p>
<p>So, for every piece of good news one can find a piece of bad news.  But the drop in price of solar power is impressive, and photovoltaic solar power is starting to hit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_parity">&#8216;grid parity&#8217;</a>: the point at which it&#8217;s as cheap as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_electricity_by_source">usual cost of electricity off the grid</a>:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Grid_parity_map.svg"><br />
<img width="450" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Grid_parity_map.svg/450px-Grid_parity_map.svg.png" /></a>
</div>
<p>According to this map based on reports put out by Deutsche Bank (<a href="https://www.deutschebank.nl/nl/docs/Solar_-_2014_Outlook_Let_the_Second_Gold_Rush_Begin.pdf">here</a> and <a href="https://www.db.com/cr/en/docs/solar_report_full_length.pdf">here</a>), the green countries reached grid parity before 2014.  The blue countries reached it after 2014.  The olive countries have reached it only for peak grid prices.  The orange regions are US states that were &#8216;poised to reach grid parity&#8217; in 2015.</p>
<p>But of course there are other issues: the intermittency of solar power, the difficulties of storing energy, etc.  How optimistic should we be?</p>
