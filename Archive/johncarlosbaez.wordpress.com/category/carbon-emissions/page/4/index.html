				<div class="entry">
					<p>Famous climate scientist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Caldeira">Ken Caldeira</a> has a new article out:</p>
<p>&bull; Ken Caldeira, <a href="http://globalecology.stanford.edu/labs/caldeiralab/Caldeira_research/Caldeira_MIT.html">Stop Emissions!</a>, <em>Technology Review</em>, January/February 2016, 41&#8211;43.</p>
<p>Let me quote a bit:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Many years ago, I protested at the gates of a nuclear power plant. For a long time, I believed it would be easy to get energy from biomass, wind, and solar. Small is beautiful. Distributed power, not centralized.</p>
<p>I wish I could still believe that.</p>
<p>My thinking changed when I worked with <a href="http://thebreakthrough.org/people/profile/marty-hoffert">Marty Hoffert</a> of New York University on <a href="http://stephenschneider.stanford.edu/Publications/PDF_Papers/HoffertEtAl.pdf">research that was first published in <i>Nature</i> in 1998</a>. It was the first peer-reviewed study that examined the amount of near-zero-emission energy we would need in order to solve the climate problem. Unfortunately, our conclusions still hold. We need massive deployment of affordable and dependable near-zero-emission energy, and we need a major research and development program to develop better energy and transportation systems.</p>
<p>It’s true that wind and solar power have been getting much more attractive in recent years. Both have gotten significantly cheaper. Even so, neither wind nor solar is dependable enough, and batteries do not yet exist that can store enough energy at affordable prices to get a modern industrial society through those times when the wind is not blowing and the sun is not shining.</p>
<p>Recent analyses suggest that wind and solar power, connected by a continental-scale electric grid and using natural-gas power plants to provide backup, could reduce greenhouse-gas emissions from electricity production by about two-thirds. But generating electricity is responsible for only about one-third of total global carbon dioxide emissions, which are increasing by more than 2 percent a year. So even if we had this better electric sector tomorrow, within a decade or two emissions would be back where they are today.</p>
<p>We need to bring much, much more to bear on the climate problem. It can’t be solved unless it is addressed as seriously as we address national security. The politicians who go to the Paris Climate Conference are making commitments that fall far short of what would be needed to substantially reduce climate risk.</p>
<h3> Daunting math </h3>
<p>Four weeks ago, a hurricane-strength cyclone smashed into Yemen, in the Arabian Peninsula, for the first time in recorded history. Also this fall, a hurricane with the most powerful winds ever measured slammed into the Pacific coast of Mexico.</p>
<p>Unusually intense storms such as these are a predicted consequence of global warming, as are longer heat waves and droughts and many other negative weather-related events that we can expect to become more commonplace. Already, in the middle latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, average temperatures are increasing at a rate that is equivalent to moving south about 10 meters (30 feet) each day. This rate is about 100 times faster than most climate change that we can observe in the geologic record, and it gravely threatens biodiversity in many parts of the world. We are already losing about two coral reefs each week, largely as a direct consequence of our greenhouse-gas emissions.</p>
<p>Recently, my colleagues and I studied what will happen in the long term if we continue pulling fossil carbon out of the ground and releasing it into the atmosphere. We found that it would take many thousands of years for the planet to recover from this insult. If we burn all available fossil-fuel resources and dump the resulting carbon dioxide waste in the sky, we can expect global average temperatures to be 9 °C (15 °F) warmer than today even 10,000 years into the future. We can expect sea levels to be about 60 meters (200 feet) higher than today. In much of the tropics, it is possible that mammals (including us) would not be able to survive outdoors in the daytime heat. Thus, it is essential to our long-term well-being that fossil-fuel carbon does not go into our atmosphere.</p>

</div>
<p>If we want to reduce the threat of climate change in the near future, there are actions to take now: reduce emissions of short-lived pollutants such as black carbon, cut emissions of methane from natural-gas fields and landfills, and so on. We need to slow and then reverse deforestation, adopt electric cars, and build solar, wind, and nuclear plants.</p>
<p>But while existing technologies can start us down the path, they can’t get us to our goal. Most analysts believe we should decarbonize electricity generation and use electricity for transportation, industry, and even home heating. (Using electricity for heating is wildly inefficient, but there may be no better solution in a carbon-constrained world.) This would require a system of electricity generation several times larger than the one we have now. Can we really use existing technology to scale up our system so dramatically while markedly reducing emissions from that sector?</p>
<p>Solar power is the only energy source that we know can power civilization indefinitely. Unfortunately, we do not have global-scale electricity grids that could wheel solar energy from day to night. At the scale of the regional electric grid, we do not have batteries that can balance daytime electricity generation with nighttime demand.</p>
<p>We should do what we know how to do. But all the while, we need to be thinking about what we don’t know how to do. We need to find better ways to generate, store, and transmit electricity. We also need better zero-carbon fuels for the parts of the economy that can’t be electrified. And most important, perhaps, we need better ways of using energy.</p>
<p>Energy is a means, not an end. We don’t want energy so much as we want what it makes possible: transportation, entertainment, shelter, and nutrition. Given United Nations estimates that the world will have at least 11 billion people by the end of this century (50 percent more than today), and given that we can expect developing economies to grow rapidly, demand for services that require energy is likely to increase by a factor of 10 or more over the next century. If we want to stabilize the climate, we need to reduce total emissions from today’s level by a factor of 10. Put another way, if we want to destroy neither our environment nor our economy, we need to reduce the emissions per energy service provided by a factor of 100. This requires something of an energy miracle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The essay continues.</p>
<p>Near the end, he writes &#8220;despite all these reasons for despair, I&#8217;m hopeful&#8221;.  He is hopeful that a collective change of heart is underway that will enable humanity to solve this problem.  But he doesn&#8217;t claim to know any workable solution to the problem.  In fact, he mostly list reasons why various possible solutions won&#8217;t be enough.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.news.com.au/technology/environment/nasa-warns-of-worst-ever-forest-fires-environmental-disaster-as-smoke-blankets-six-countries/story-e6frflp0-1227585225331"><img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ecological/indonesia_fires_2015.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>I lived in Singapore for two years, and I go back to work there every summer.  I love Southeast Asia, its beautiful landscapes, its friendly people, and its huge biological and cultural diversity.  It&#8217;s a magical place.</p>
<p>But in 2013 there was a horrible haze from fires in nearby Sumatra.  And this year it&#8217;s even worse.  It makes me want to cry, thinking about how millions of people all over this region are being choked as the rain forest burns.</p>
<p>This part of the world has a dry season from May to October and then a wet season.  In the dry season, Indonesian farmers slash down jungle growth, burn it, and plant crops.  That is nothing new.</p>
<p>But now, palm oil plantations run by big companies do this on a massive scale.  Jungles are disappearing at an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation_in_Borneo">astonishing rate</a>.  Some of this is illegal, but corrupt government officials are paid to look the other way.  Whenever we buy palm oil&mdash;in soap, cookies, bread, margarine, detergents, and many other products&mdash;we become part of the problem.</p>
<p>This year the fires are worse.  One reason is that we&#8217;re having an El Niño.  That typically means more rain in California&mdash;which we desperately need.  But it means less rain in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>This summer it was very dry in Singapore.  Then, in September, the haze started.  We got used to rarely seeing the sun&mdash;only yellow-brown light filtering through the smoke.  When it stinks outside, you try to stay indoors.</p>
<p>When I left on September 19th, the PSI index of air pollution had risen above 200, which is &#8216;very unhealthy&#8217;.   Singapore had offered troops to help fight the fires, but Indonesia turned down the offer, saying they could handle the situation themselves.  That was completely false: thousands of fires were burning out of control in Sumatra, Borneo and other Indonesian islands.</p>
<p>I believe the Indonesian government just didn&#8217;t want foreign troops out their land.  Satellites could detect the many hot spots where fires were burning.  But outrageously, the government refused to say who owned those lands.</p>
<p>A few days after I left, the PSI index in Singapore had shot above 300, which is &#8216;hazardous&#8217;.  But in parts of Borneo the PSI had reached 1,986.  The only name for that is <i>hell</i>.</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/30/indonesia-fires-disaster-21st-century-world-media"><img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ecological/indonesia_fires_2015_ulet_ifansasti.jpg" /></a>
</div>
<p>By now Indonesia has accepted help from Singapore.  Thanks to changing winds, the PSI in Singapore has been slowly dropping throughout October.  In the last few days the rainy season has begun.   Each time the rain clears the air, Singaporeans can see something beautiful and almost forgotten: a blue sky.</p>
<p>Rain is also helping in Borneo.  But the hellish fires continue.  There have been over 100,000 individual fires&mdash;mostly in Sumatra, Borneo and Papua.  In many places, peat in the ground has caught on fire!  It&#8217;s very hard to put out a peat fire.</p>
<p>If you care about the Earth, this is very disheartening.  These fires have been putting over 15 million tons of carbon dioxide into the air per day &#8211; more than the whole US economy!  And so far this year they&#8217;ve put out 1.5 billion tons of CO<sub>2</sub>.  That&#8217;s more than Germany&#8217;s carbon emissions for the whole year&mdash;in fact, even more than Japan&#8217;s.  How can we make progress on reducing carbon emissions with this going on?</p>
<p>For you and me, the first thing is to stop buying products with palm oil.  The problem is largely one of government corruption driven by money from palm oil plantations.  But the real heart of the problem lies in Indonesia.  Luckily Widodo, the president of this country, may be part of the solution.  But the solution will be difficult.</p>
<p>Quoting National Public Radio:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Widodo is Indonesia&#8217;s first president with a track record of efficient local governance in running two large cities. Strong action on the haze issue could help fulfill the promise of reform that motivated Indonesian voters to put him in office in October 2014.</p>
<p>The president has deployed thousands of firefighters and accepted international assistance. He has ordered a moratorium on new licenses to use peat land and ordered law enforcers to prosecute people and companies who clear land by burning forests.</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be stopped, we mustn&#8217;t allow our tropical rainforests to disappear because of monoculture plantations like oil palms,&#8221; Widodo said early in his administration.</p>
<p>Land recently burned and planted with palm trees is now under police investigation in Kalimantan [the Indonesian part of Borneo].</p>
<p>The problem of Indonesia&#8217;s illegal forest fires is so complex that it&#8217;s very hard to say exactly who is responsible for causing it.</p>
<p>Indonesia&#8217;s government has blamed both big palm oil companies and small freeholders. Poynton [executive director of the Forest Trust] says the culprits are often mid-sized companies with strong ties to local politicians. He describes them as lawless middlemen who pay local farmers to burn forests and plant oil palms, often on other companies&#8217; concessions.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are these sort of low-level, Mafioso-type guys that basically say, &#8216;You get in there and clear the land, and I&#8217;ll then finance you to establish a palm oil plantation,'&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>The problem is exacerbated by ingrained government corruption, in which politicians grant land use permits for forests and peat lands to agribusiness in exchange for financial and political support.</p>
<p>&#8220;The disaster is not in the fires,&#8221; says independent Jakarta-based commentator Wimar Witoelar. &#8220;It&#8217;s in the way that past Indonesian governments have colluded with big palm oil businesses to make the peat lands a recipe for disaster.&#8221;

<p>The quote is from here:</p>
<p>• Anthony Kuhn, <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2015/11/01/453141693/as-indonesias-annual-fires-rage-plenty-of-blame-but-no-responsibility">As Indonesia&#8217;s annual fires rage, plenty of blame but no responsibility</a>.</p>
<p>For how to avoid using palm oil, see for example:</p>
<p>• Lael Goodman, <a href="http://blog.ucsusa.org/how-many-products-with-palm-oil-do-i-use-in-a-day">How many products with palm oil do I use in a day?</a></p>
<p>First, avoid processed foods.  That&#8217;s smart for other reasons too.</p>
<p>Second, avoid stuff that contains stearic acid, sodium palmitate, sodium laureth sulfate, cetyl alcohol, glyceryl stearate and <a href="http://philadelphiazoo.org/unless-pdfs/Common-Names-for-Palm-Oil-and-Palm-Oil-Derivatives.htm">related compounds</a>&mdash;various forms of artificial grease that are often made from palm oil.   It takes work to avoid all this stuff, but at least be aware of it.  These chemicals are not made in laboratories from pure carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen!  The raw ingredients often come from palm plantations, huge monocultures that are replacing the wonderful diversity of rainforest life.﻿</p>
<p>For more nuanced suggestions, see the comments below.  Right now I&#8217;m just so disgusted that I want to avoid palm oil.</p>

<p>This shows a man in Malaysia in September.  Click on the pictures for more details.  The picture at top shows a woman named a woman named Gaye Thavisin in Indonesia&mdash;perhaps in Kalimantan, the Indonesian half of Borneo, the third largest island in the world.  Here is a bit of <a href="http://www.wowborneo.com/about-us">her story</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The Jungle River Cruise is run by Kalimantan Tour Destinations a foreign owned company set up by two women pioneering the introduction of ecotourism into a part of Central Kalimantan that to date has virtually no tourism.</p>
<p>Inspired by the untapped potential of Central Kalimantan’s mighty rivers, Gaye Thavisin and Lorna Dowson-Collins converted a traditional Kalimantan barge into a comfortable cruise boat with five double cabins, an inside sitting area and a upper viewing deck, bringing the first jungle cruises to the area.</p>
<p>Originally Lorna Dowson-Collins worked in Central Kalimantan with a local NGO on a sustainable livelihoods programme. The future livelihoods of the local people were under threat as logging left the land devastated with poor soils and no forest to fend from.</p>
<p>Kalimantan was teeming with the potential of her people and their fascinating culture, with beautiful forests of diverse flora and fauna, including the iconic orang-utan, and her mighty rivers providing access to these wonderful treasures.</p>
<p>An idea for a social enterprise emerged , which involved building a boat to journey guests to inaccessible places and provide comfortable accommodation.</p>
<p>Gaye Thavisin, an Australian expatriate, for 4 years operated an attractive, new hotel 36 km out of Palangkaraya in Kalimantan. Gaye was passionate about developing the tourism potential of Central Kalimantan and was also looking at the idea of boats. With her contract at the hotel coming to an end, the Jungle Cruise began to take shape!

				<h2><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/07/14/carbon-budget/" rel="bookmark">Carbon Budget</a></h2>
				<small>14 July, 2015</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p>On Quora someone asked:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  What is the most agreed-on figure for our future carbon budget?
</p></blockquote>
<p>My answer:</p>
<p>Asking &#8220;what is our future carbon budget?&#8221; is a bit like asking how many calories a day you can eat.  There&#8217;s really no limit on how much you can eat if you don&#8217;t care how overweight and unhealthy you become.  So, to set a carbon budget, you need to say how much global warming you will accept.</p>
<p>That said, here&#8217;s a picture of how we&#8217;re burning through our carbon budget:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/WEO2015SpecialReportonEnergyandClimateChange.pdf"><br />
<img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ecological/global_carbon_budget.jpg" /></a>
</div>
<p>It says that our civilization has burnt <b>60% of the carbon we&#8217;re allowed to while still having a 50-50 chance of keeping global warming below 2 °C.</b></p>
<p>This chart appears in the <i><a href="https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/weo-2015-special-report-energy-climate-change.html﻿">International Energy Agency report World Energy Outlook Special Report 2015</a></i>, which is free and definitely worth reading.</p>
<p>The orange bars show CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per year, in gigatonnes.  The blue curve shows the fraction of the total carbon budget we have left to burn, based on data from the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change.  The projection of <em>future</em> carbon emissions is based on the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) that governments are currently submitting to the United Nations.  So, based on what governments had offered to do by June 2015, we may burn through this carbon budget in 2040.</p>
<p><b>Our civilization&#8217;s total carbon budget for staying below 2 °C was about 1 trillion tonnes.  We have now burnt almost 60% of that.</b>  You can watch the amount rise as we speak:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://trillionthtonne.org/">Trillionth Tonne</a>.</p>
<p>Quoting the International Energy Agency report:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The transition away from fossil fuels is gradual in the INDC Scenario, with the share of fossil fuels in the world’s primary energy mix declining from more than 80% today to around three-quarters in 2030 [&#8230;] The projected path for energy-related emissions in the INDC Scenario means that, based on IPCC estimates, the world’s remaining carbon budget consistent with a 50% chance of keeping a temperature increase of below 2 °C would be exhausted around 2040, adding a grace period of only around eight months, compared to the date at which the budget would be exhausted in the absence of INDCs (Figure 2.3). This date is already within the lifetime of many existing energy sector assets: fossil-fuelled power plants often operate for 30-40 years or more, while existing fossil-fuel resources could, if all developed, sustain production levels far beyond 2040. If energy sector investors believed that not only new investments but also existing fossil-fuel operations would be halted at that critical point, this would have a profound effect on investment even today.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Since we seem likely to go above 2 &deg;C warming over pre-industrial levels, it would be nice to make a similar chart for a carbon budget based on 3 &deg; C warming.  The <a href="http://trillionthtonne.org/">Trillionth Tonne</a> website projects that with current trends we&#8217;ll burn 1.5 trillion tonnes, for a warming of 3 &deg;C in a cautious scenario, by 2056.</p>
<p>But: we would never burn the 1.5 trillionth tonne if emissions dropped by 1.2% per year from now on.  And we&#8217;d not even burn the trillionth tonne if they dropped by 2.6% per year.</p>

Global energy-related CO2 emissions in the INDC scenario and remaining carbon budget for a &gt;50% chance of keeping to 2&deg;C (IPCC and IEA data; IEA analysis)
</div>
<p>The <a href="http://www.lowyinterpreter.org/post/2015/06/15/Road-to-Paris-10-days-and-counting.aspx">big international climate negotiations</a> to be concluded in Paris in December 2015 bring these issues to the forefront in a dramatic way.  Countries are already saying what they plan to do: you can read their <a href="http://www4.unfccc.int/submissions/indc/Submission%20Pages/submissions.aspx">Intended Nationally Determined Contributions</a> online!</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s hard to get an overall picture of the situation.  Here&#8217;s a new report that helps:</p>
<p>&bull; International Energy Agency, <i><a href="http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/weo-2015-special-report-energy-climate-change.html">World Energy Outlook Special Report 2015: Energy and Climate Change</a></i>.</p>
<p>Since the International Energy Agency seems intelligent to me, I&#8217;ll just quote their executive summary.  If you&#8217;re too busy for even the executive summary, let me summarize the summary:</p>
<blockquote><p>  <i>Given the actions that countries are now planning, we could have an increase of around 2.6 °C over preindustrial temperature by 2100, and more after that.</i>
</p></blockquote>
<h3> Executive summary </h3>
<p><b>A major milestone in efforts to combat climate change is fast approaching</b>. The importance of the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21) – to be held in Paris in December 2015 – rests not only in its specific achievements by way of new contributions, but also in the direction it sets. There are already some encouraging signs with a historic joint announcement by the United States and China on climate change, and climate pledges for COP21 being submitted by a diverse range of countries and in development in many others. The overall test of success for COP21 will be the conviction it conveys that governments are determined to act to the full extent necessary to achieve the goal they have already set to keep the rise in global average temperatures below 2 degrees Celsius (°C), relative to pre-industrial levels.</p>
<p><b>Energy will be at the core of the discussion.</b> Energy production and use account for two-thirds of the world’s greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions, meaning that the pledges made at COP21 must bring deep cuts in these emissions, while yet sustaining the growth of the world economy, boosting energy security around the world and bringing modern energy to the billions who lack it today. The agreement reached at COP21 must be comprehensive geographically, which means it must be equitable, reflecting both national responsibilities and prevailing circumstances. The importance of the energy component is why this World Energy Outlook Special Report presents detailed energy and climate analysis for the sector and recommends four key pillars on which COP21 can build success.</p>
<h4>Energy and emissions: moving apart?</h4>
<p><b>The use of low-carbon energy sources is expanding rapidly, and there are signs that growth in the global economy and energy-related emissions may be starting to decouple.</b>  The global economy grew by around 3% in 2014 but energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions stayed flat, the first time in at least 40 years that such an outcome has occurred outside economic crisis.</p>
<p>Renewables accounted for nearly half of all new power generation capacity in 2014, led by growth in China, the United States, Japan and Germany, with investment remaining strong (at $270 billion) and costs continuing to fall. The energy intensity of the global economy dropped by 2.3% in 2014, more than double the average rate of fall over the last decade, a result stemming from improved energy efficiency and structural changes in some economies, such as China.</p>
<p>Around 11% of global energy-related CO2 emissions arise in areas that operate a carbon market (where the average price is $7 per tonne of CO2), while 13% of energy-related CO2 emissions arise in markets with fossil-fuel consumption subsidies (an incentive equivalent to $115 per tonne of CO2, on average). There are some encouraging signs on both fronts, with reform in sight for the European Union’s Emissions Trading Scheme and countries including India, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand taking the opportunity of lower oil prices to diminish fossil-fuel subsidies, cutting the incentive for wasteful consumption.</p>
<h4> The energy contribution to COP21 </h4>
<p><b>Nationally determined pledges are the foundation of COP21.</b> Intended Nationally<br />
Determined Contributions (<a href="http://www4.unfccc.int/submissions/indc/Submission%20Pages/submissions.aspx">INDCs</a>) submitted by countries in advance of COP21 may vary in scope but will contain, implicitly or explicitly, commitments relating to the energy sector. As of 14 May 2015, countries accounting for 34% of energy-related emissions had submitted their new pledges.</p>
<p>A first assessment of the impact of these INDCs and related policy statements (such as by China) on future energy trends is presented in this report in an “INDC Scenario”. This shows, for example, that the United States’ pledge to cut net greenhouse-gas emissions by 26% to 28% by 2025 (relative to 2005 levels) would deliver a major reduction in emissions while the economy grows by more than one-third over current levels. The European Union’s pledge to cut GHG emissions by at least 40% by 2030 (relative to 1990 levels) would see energy-related CO2 emissions decline at nearly twice the rate achieved since 2000, making it one of the world’s least carbon-intensive energy economies. Russia’s energy-related emissions decline slightly from 2013 to 2030 and it meets its 2030 target comfortably, while implementation of Mexico’s pledge would see its energy-related emissions increase slightly while its economy grows much more rapidly. China has yet to submit its INDC, but has stated an intention to achieve a peak in its CO2 emissions around 2030 (if not earlier), an important change in direction, given the pace at which they have grown on average since 2000.</p>
<p><b>Growth in global energy-related GHG emissions slows but there is no peak by 2030 in the INDC Scenario.</b> The link between global economic output and energy-related GHG emissions weakens significantly, but is not broken: the economy grows by 88% from 2013 to 2030 and energy-related CO2 emissions by 8% (reaching 34.8 gigatonnes). Renewables become the leading source of electricity by 2030, as average annual investment in nonhydro renewables is 80% higher than levels seen since 2000, but inefficient coal-fired power generation capacity declines only slightly.</p>
<p>With INDCs submitted so far, and the planned energy policies in countries that have yet to submit, the world’s estimated remaining carbon budget consistent with a 50% chance of keeping the rise in temperature below 2 °C is consumed by around 2040&#8212;eight months later than is projected in the absence of INDCs. This underlines the need for all countries to submit ambitious INDCs for COP21 and for these INDCs to be recognised as a basis upon which to build stronger future action, including from opportunities for collaborative/co-ordinated action or those enabled by a transfer of resources (such as technology and finance). If stronger action is not forthcoming after 2030, the path in the INDC Scenario would be consistent with an an average temperature increase of around 2.6 °C by 2100 and 3.5 °C after 2200.</p>
<h4> What does the energy sector need from COP21?</p>
<p>National pledges submitted for COP21 need to form the basis for a “virtuous circle” of rising ambition. From COP21, the energy sector needs to see a projection from political leaders at the highest level of clarity of purpose and certainty of action, creating a clear expectation of global and national low-carbon development. Four pillars can support that achievement:</p>
<p>1. Peak in emissions – set the conditions which will achieve an early peak in global<br />
energy-related emissions.</p>
<p>2. Five-year revision – review contributions regularly, to test the scope to lift the level of ambition.</p>
<p>3. Lock in the vision – translate the established climate goal into a collective long-term emissions goal, with shorter-term commitments that are consistent with the long-term vision.</p>
<p>4. Track the transition – establish an effective process for tracking achievements in<br />
the energy sector.</p>
<h3> Peak in emissions</h3>
<p>The IEA proposes a bridging strategy that could deliver a peak in global energy-related<br />
emissions by 2020. A commitment to target such a near-term peak would send a clear message of political determination to stay below the 2 °C climate limit. The peak can be<br />
achieved relying solely on proven technologies and policies, without changing the economic and development prospects of any region, and is presented in a “Bridge Scenario”. The technologies and policies reflected in the Bridge Scenario are essential to secure the long-term decarbonisation of the energy sector and their near-term adoption can help keep the door to the 2 °C goal open. For countries that have submitted their INDCs, the proposed strategy identifies possible areas for over-achievement. For those that have yet to make a submission, it sets out a pragmatic baseline for ambition.</p>
<p>The Bridge Scenario depends upon five measures:</p>
<p>&bull; Increasing energy efficiency in the industry, buildings and transport sectors.</p>
<p>&bull; Progressively reducing the use of the least-efficient coal-fired power plants and<br />
banning their construction.</p>
<p>&bull; Increasing investment in renewable energy technologies in the power sector from<br />
$270 billion in 2014 to $400 billion in 2030.</p>
<p>&bull; Gradual phasing out of fossil-fuel subsidies to end-users by 2030.</p>
<p>&bull; Reducing methane emissions in oil and gas production.</p>
<p><b>These measures have profound implications for the global energy mix, putting a brake on growth in oil and coal use within the next five years and further boosting renewables.</b> In the Bridge Scenario, coal use peaks before 2020 and then declines while oil demand rises to 2020 and then plateaus. Total energy-related GHG emissions peak around 2020. Both the energy intensity of the global economy and the carbon intensity of power generation improve by 40% by 2030. <i>China</i> decouples its economic expansion from emissions growth by around 2020, much earlier than otherwise expected, mainly through improving the energy efficiency of industrial motors and the buildings sector, including through standards for appliances and lighting. In countries where emissions are already in decline today, the decoupling of economic growth and emissions is significantly accelerated; compared with recent years, the pace of this decoupling is almost 30% faster in the <i>European Union</i> (due to improved energy efficiency) and in the <i>United States</i> (where renewables contribute one-third of the achieved emissions savings in 2030). In other regions, the link between economic growth and emissions growth is weakened significantly, but the relative importance of different measures varies. <i>India</i> utilises energy more efficiently, helping it<br />
to reach its energy sector targets and moderate emissions growth, while the reduction of<br />
methane releases from oil and gas production and reforming fossil-fuel subsidies (while<br />
providing targeted support for the poorest) are key measures in the <i>Middle East</i> and <i>Africa</i>, and a portfolio of options helps reduce emissions in <i>Southeast Asia</i>. While universal access to modern energy is not achieved in the Bridge Scenario, the efforts to reduce energy related emissions do go hand-in-hand with delivering access to electricity to 1.7 billion people and access to clean cookstoves to 1.6 billion people by 2030.<br />

				<h2><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/05/15/carbon-emissions-stop-growing/" rel="bookmark">Carbon Emissions Stopped&nbsp;Growing?</a></h2>
				<small>15 May, 2015</small><br />


				<div class="entry">
					<p><em>In 2014, global carbon dioxide emissions from energy production stopped growing!</em></p>
<p>At least, that&#8217;s what preliminary data from the International Energy Agency say.  It seems the big difference is China.  The Chinese made more electricity from renewable sources, such as hydropower, solar and wind, and burned less coal.</p>
<p>In fact, a report by Greenpeace says that from April 2014 to April 2015, China&#8217;s carbon emissions dropped by an amount equal to the <em>entire carbon emissions of the United Kingdom!</em></p>
<p>I want to check this, because it would be wonderful if true: a 5% drop.  They say that if this trend continues, China will close out 2015 with the biggest reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions every recorded by a single country.</p>
<p>The International Energy Agency also credits Europe&#8217;s improved attempts to cut carbon emissions for the turnaround.   In the US, carbon emissions has basically been dropping since 2006&#8212;with a big drop in 2009 due to the economic collapse, a partial bounce-back in 2010, but a general downward trend.</p>
<p>In the last 40 years, there have only been 3 times in which emissions stood still or fell compared to the previous year, all during global economic crises: the early 1980&#8217;s, 1992, and 2009.  In 2014, however, the global economy expanded by 3%.</p>
<p>So, the tide may be turning!   But please remember: while carbon emissions may start dropping, they&#8217;re still huge.  The amount of the CO2 in the air <a href="http://climate.nasa.gov/400ppmquotes/">shot above 400 parts per million</a> in March this year.  As <a href="http://climate.nasa.gov/400ppmquotes/">Erika Podest of NASA put it</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  CO2 concentrations haven&#8217;t been this high in millions of years. Even more alarming is the rate of increase in the last five decades and the fact that CO2 stays in the atmosphere for hundreds or thousands of years. This milestone is a wake up call that our actions in response to climate change need to match the persistent rise in CO2. Climate change is a threat to life on Earth and we can no longer afford to be spectators.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Here is the announcement by the International Energy Agency:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.iea.org/newsroomandevents/news/2015/march/global-energy-related-emissions-of-carbon-dioxide-stalled-in-2014.html">Global energy-related emissions of carbon dioxide stalled in 2014</a>, IEA, 13 March 2015.</p>
<p>Their full report on this subject will come out on 15 June 2015.  Here is the report by Greenpeace EnergyDesk:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://energydesk.greenpeace.org/2015/05/14/china-coal-consumption-drops-further-carbon-emissions-set-to-fall-by-equivalent-of-uk-total-in-one-year/">China coal use falls: CO<sub>2</sub> reduction this year could equal UK total emissions over same period</a>, Greenpeace EnergyDesk.</p>
<p>I trust them less than the IEA when it comes to using statistics correctly, but someone should be able to verify their claims if true.</p>

</div>
<p>Russian scientists have recently found more new craters in Siberia, apparently formed by explosions of methane.  Three were found last summer.  They looked for more using satellite photos&#8230; and found more!</p>
<p>“What I think is happening here is, the permafrost has been acting as a cap or seal on the ground, through which gas can’t permeate,” says Paul Overduin, a permafrost expert at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany. “And it reaches a particular temperature where there’s not enough ice in it to act that way anymore. And then gas can rush out.”</p>
<p>It&#8217;s rather dramatic.  Some Russian villagers have even claimed to see flashes in the distance when these explosions occur.  But how bad is it?</p>
<h3> <i>The Siberian Times</i> </h3>
<p>An English-language newspaper called <i>The Siberian Times</i> has a good article about these craters, which I&#8217;ll quote extensively:</p>
<p>&bull; Anna Liesowska <a href="http://siberiantimes.com/science/casestudy/news/n0127-dozens-of-mysterious-new-craters-suspected-in-northern-russia/">Dozens of new craters suspected in northern Russia</a>, <i>The Siberian Times</i>, 23 February 2015.</p>

</div>
<blockquote><p>
Respected Moscow scientist Professor Vasily Bogoyavlensky has called for &#8216;urgent&#8217; investigation of the new phenomenon amid safety fears.</p>
<p>Until now, only three large craters were known about in northern Russia with several scientific sources speculating last year that heating from above the surface due to unusually warm climatic conditions, and from below, due to geological fault lines, led to a huge release of gas hydrates, so causing the formation of these craters in Arctic regions. </p>
<p>Two of the newly-discovered large craters&mdash;also known as funnels to scientists&mdash;have turned into lakes, revealed Professor Bogoyavlensky, deputy director of the Moscow-based Oil and Gas Research Institute, part of the Russian Academy of Sciences. </p>
<p>Examination using satellite images has helped Russian experts understand that the craters are more widespread than was first realised, with one large hole surrounded by as many as 20 mini-craters, <i>The Siberian Times</i> can reveal.

<blockquote><p>
&#8216;We know now of seven craters in the Arctic area,&#8217; he said. &#8216;Five are directly on the Yamal peninsula, one in Yamal Autonomous district, and one is on the north of the Krasnoyarsk region, near the Taimyr peninsula. </p>
<p>&#8216;We have exact locations for only four of them. The other three were spotted by reindeer herders. But I am sure that there are more craters on Yamal, we just need to search for them. </p>
<p>&#8216;I would compare this with mushrooms: when you find one mushroom, be sure there are few more around. I suppose there could be 20 to 30 craters more.&#8217;</p>
<p>He is anxious to investigate the craters further because of serious concerns for safety in these regions.</p>
<p>The study of satellite images showed that near the famous hole, located in 30 kilometres from Bovanenkovo are two potentially dangerous objects, where the gas emission can occur at any moment.

He warned: &#8216;These objects need to be studied, but it is rather dangerous for the researchers. We know that there can occur a series of gas emissions over an extended period of time, but we do not know exactly when they might happen.</p>
<p>&#8216;For example, you all remember the magnificent shots of the Yamal crater in winter, made during the latest expedition in Novomber 2014. But do you know that Vladimir Pushkarev, director of the Russian Centre of Arctic Exploration, was the first man in the world who went down the crater of gas emission? </p>
<p>&#8216;More than this, it was very risky, because no one could guarantee there would not be new emissions.&#8217;</p>
<p>Professor Bogoyavlensky told The Siberian Times: &#8216;One of the most interesting objects here is the crater that we mark as B2, located 10 kilometres to the south of Bovanenkovo. On the satellite image you can see that it is one big lake surrounded by more than 20 small craters filled with water. </p>
<p>&#8216;Studying the satellite images we found out that initially there were no craters nor a lake. Some craters appeared, then more. Then, I suppose that the craters filled with water and turned to several lakes, then merged into one large lake, 50 by 100 metres in diameter. </p>
<p>&#8216;This big lake is surrounded by the network of  more than 20 &#8216;baby&#8217; craters now filled with water and I suppose that new ones could appear last summer or even now. We now counting them and making a catalogue. Some of them are very small, no more than 2 metres in diameter.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;We have not been at the spot yet,&#8217; he said. &#8216;Probably some local reindeer herders were there, but so far no scientists.&#8217;</p>
<p>He explained: &#8216;After studying this object I am pretty sure that there was a series of gas emissions over an extended period of time. Sadly, we do not know, when exactly these emissions occur, i.e. mostly in summer, or in winter too. We see only the results of this emissions.&#8217;</p>
<p>The object B2 is now attracting special attention from the researchers as they seek to understand and explain the phenomenon. This is only 10km from Bovanenkovo, a major gas field, developed by Gazprom, in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug. Yet older satellite images do not show the existence of a lake, nor any craters, in this location. </p>
<p>Not only the new craters constantly forming on Yamal show that the process of gas emission is ongoing actively.</p>

<blockquote><p>
He commented: &#8216;This haze that you see on the surface shows that gas seeps that go from the bottom of the lake to the surface. We call this process &#8216;degassing&#8217;. </p>
<p>&#8216;We do not know, if there was a crater previously and then turned to lake, or the lake formed during some other process. More important is that the gases from within are actively seeping through this lake.</p>
<p>&#8216;Degassing was revealed on the territory of Yamal Autonomous District about 45 years ago, but now we think that it can give us some clues about the formation of the craters and gas emissions. Anyway, we must research this phenomenon urgently, to prevent possible disasters.&#8217;</p>
<p>Professor Bogoyavlensky stressed: &#8216;For now, we can speak only about the results of our work in the laboratory, using the images from space. </p>
<p>&#8216;No one knows what is happening in these craters at the moment. We plan a new expedition. Also we want to put not less than four seismic stations in Yamal district, so they can fix small earthquakes, that occur when the crater appears. </p>
<p>&#8216;In two cases locals told us that they felt earth tremors. The nearest seismic station was yet too far to register these tremors.</p>
<p>&#8216;I think that at the moment we know enough about the crater B1. There were several expeditions, we took probes and made measurements. I believe that we need to visit the other craters, namely B2, B3 and B4, and then visit the rest three craters, when we will know their exact location. It will give us more information and will bring us closer to understanding the phenomenon.&#8217;</p>
<p>He urged: &#8216;It is important not to scare people, but to understand that it is a very serious problem and we must research this.&#8217;</p>
<p>In an article for Drilling and Oil magazine, Professor Bogoyavlensky said the parapet of these craters suggests an underground explosion.</p>
<p>&#8216;The absence of charred rock and traces of  significant erosion due to possible water leaks speaks in favour of mighty eruption (pneumatic exhaust) of gas from a shallow underground reservoir, which left no traces on soil which contained a high percentage of ice,&#8217; he wrote. </p>
<p>&#8216;In other words, it was a gas-explosive mechanism that worked there. A concentration of 5-to-16% of methane is explosive. The most explosive concentration is 9.5%.&#8217;</p>
<p>Gas probably concentrated underground in a cavity &#8216;which formed due to the gradual melting of buried ice&#8217;. Then &#8216;gas was replacing ice and water&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8216;Years of experience has shown that gas emissions can cause serious damage to drilling rigs, oil and gas fields and offshore pipelines,&#8217; he said. &#8216;Yamal craters are inherently similar to pockmarks. </p>
<p>&#8216;We cannot rule out new gas emissions in the Arctic and in some cases they can ignite.&#8217;</p>
<p>This was possible in the case of the crater found at Antipayuta, on the Yamal peninsula. </p>
<p>&#8216;The Antipayuta residents told how they saw some flash. Probably the gas ignited when appeared the crater B4, near Taimyr peninsula. This shows us, that such explosion could be rather dangerous and destructive. </p>
<p>&#8216;We need to answer now the basic questions: what areas and under what conditions are the most dangerous? These questions are important for safe operation of the northern cities and infrastructure of oil and gas complexes.&#8217;

<h3> How bad is it? </h3>
<p>Since methane is a powerful greenhouse gas, some people are getting nervous.  If global warming releases the huge amounts of methane trapped under permafrost, will that create more global warming?  Could we be getting into a runaway feedback loop?</p>
<p>The <i>Washington Post</i> has a good article telling us to pay attention, but not panic:</p>
<p>&bull; Chris Mooney, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/03/02/why-you-shouldnt-freak-out-about-those-mysterious-siberian-craters/">Why you shouldn&#8217;t freak out about those mysterious Siberian craters</a>, Chris Mooney, 2 March 2015.</p>
<p>David Archer of the University of Chicago, a famous expert on climate change and the carbon cycle, took a look at thes craters and did some quick calculations.  He estimated that “it would take about 20,000,000 such eruptions within a few years to generate the standard Arctic Methane Apocalypse that people have been talking about.”</p>
<p>More importantly, people are measuring the amount of methane in the air.   We know how it&#8217;s doing.  For example, you can make graphs of methane concentration here:</p>

<p>Methane has gone up from about 1750 to 1900 nanomoles per mole from 1985 to 2015.  That&#8217;s a big increase&mdash;but not a sign of incipient disaster.</p>
<p>A larger perspective might help.  Apparently from 1750 to 2007 the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration increased about 40% while the methane concentration has increased about 160%.  The amount of additional radiative forcing due to CO<sub>2</sub> is about 1.6 watts per square meter, while for methane it&#8217;s about 0.5:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas#Natural_and_anthropogenic_sources">Greenhouse gas: natural and anthropogenic sources</a>, Wikipedia.</p>
<p>So, methane is significant, and increasing fast.  So far CO<sub>2</sub> is the 800-pound gorilla in the living room.  But I&#8217;m glad Russian scientists are doing things like this:</p>

<img width="445" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ecological/Xcel_wind_power.jpg" /><br />
</a></p>
<p>Electric power companies complain about wind power because it&#8217;s intermittent: if suddenly the wind stops, they have to bring in other sources of power.  </p>
<p>This is no big deal if we only use a little wind.  Across the US, wind now supplies 4% of electric power; even in Germany it&#8217;s just 8%.  The problem starts if we use a lot of wind.  If we&#8217;re not careful, we&#8217;ll need big fossil-fuel-powered electric plants when the wind stops.  And these need to be turned on, ready to pick up the slack at a moment&#8217;s notice! </p>
<p>So, a few years ago Xcel Energy, which supplies much of Colorado’s power, ran ads opposing a proposal that it use renewable sources for 10% of its power.   </p>
<p>But now things have changed.  Now Xcel gets about 15% of their power from wind, on average.  And sometimes this spikes to much more!  </p>
<p>What made the difference?</p>
<p>Every few seconds, hundreds of turbines measure the wind speed.  Every 5 minutes, they send this data to high-performance computers 100 miles away at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder.  NCAR crunches these numbers along with data from weather satellites, weather stations, and other wind farms &#8211; and creates highly accurate wind power forecasts.  </p>
<p>With better prediction, Xcel can do a better job of shutting down idling backup plants on days when they&#8217;re not needed.   Last year was a breakthrough year &#8211; better forecasts saved Xcel nearly as much money as they had in the three previous years combined.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all part of the emerging <b>smart grid</b>&#8212;an intelligent network that someday will include appliances and electric cars.  With a good smart grid, we could set our washing  machine to run when power is cheap.  Maybe electric cars could store solar power in the day, use it to power neighborhoods when electricity demand peaks in the evening &#8211; then recharge their batteries using wind power in the early morning hours.  And so on.</p>
<h3> References </h3>
<p>I would love if it the <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/">Network Theory</a> project could ever grow to the point of helping design the smart grid.  So far we are doing much more &#8216;foundational&#8217; work on control theory, along with a more applied project on predicting El Ni&ntilde;os.   I&#8217;ll talk about both of these soon!  But I have big hopes and dreams, so I want to keep learning more about power grids and the like.</p>

<p>The first is fun and easy to read.   The second has more technical details. It describes the software used (the picture on top of this article shows a bit of this), and also some of the underlying math and physics.  Let me quote a bit:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>
High-resolution Mesoscale Ensemble Prediction Model (EPM)<br />
</h4>
<p>It is known that atmospheric processes are chaotic in nature. This implies that even small errors in the model initial conditions combined with the imperfections inherent in the NWP model formulations, such as truncation errors and approximations in model dynamics and physics, can lead to a wind forecast with large errors for certain weather regimes. Thus, probabilistic wind prediction approaches are necessary for guiding wind power applications. Ensemble prediction is at present a practical approach for producing such probabilistic predictions. An innovative mesoscale Ensemble Real-Time Four Dimensional Data Assimilation (E-RTFDDA) and forecasting system that was developed at NCAR was used as the basis for incorporating this ensemble prediction capability into the Xcel forecasting system.
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_forecasting">Ensemble prediction</a> means that instead of a single weather forecast, we generate a probability distribution on the set of weather forecasts.  The paper has references explaining this in more detail.</p>
<p>We had a nice discussion of wind power and the smart grid <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/117663015413546257905/posts/gzMu9f27aDN">over on G+</a>.  Among other things, John Despujols mentioned the role of &#8216;smart inverters&#8217; in enhancing grid stability:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.digikey.com/en/articles/techzone/2013/nov/smart-solar-inverters-smooth-out-voltage-fluctuations-for-grid-stability">Smart solar inverters smooth out voltage fluctuations for grid stability</a>, <i>DigiKey article library</i>.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_inverter">solar inverter</a> converts the variable direct current output of a photovoltaic solar panel into alternating current usable by the electric grid.  There&#8217;s a lot of math involved here&#8212;click the link for a Wikipedia summary.  But solar inverters are getting smarter.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>
Wild fluctuations<br />
</h4>
<p>While the solar inverter has long been the essential link between the photovoltaic panel and the electricity distribution network and converting DC to AC, its role is expanding due to the massive growth in solar energy generation. Utility companies and grid operators have become increasingly concerned about managing what can potentially be wildly fluctuating levels of energy produced by the huge (and still growing) number of grid-connected solar systems, whether they are rooftop systems or utility-scale solar farms. Intermittent production due to cloud cover or temporary faults has the potential to destabilize the grid. In addition, grid operators are struggling to plan ahead due to lack of accurate data on production from these systems as well as on true energy consumption.</p>
<p>In large-scale facilities, virtually all output is fed to the national grid or micro-grid, and is typically well monitored. At the rooftop level, although individually small, collectively the amount of energy produced has a significant potential. California estimated it has more than 150,000 residential rooftop grid-connected solar systems with a potential to generate 2.7 MW.</p>
<p>However, while in some systems all the solar energy generated is fed to the grid and not accessible to the producer, others allow energy generated to be used immediately by the producer, with only the excess fed to the grid. In the latter case, smart meters may only measure the net output for billing purposes. In many cases, information on production and consumption, supplied by smart meters to utility companies, may not be available to the grid operators.</p>
<h4> Getting smarter</h4>
<p>The solution according to industry experts is the smart inverter. Every inverter, whether at panel level or megawatt-scale, has a role to play in grid stability. Traditional inverters have, for safety reasons, become controllable, so that they can be disconnected from the grid at any sign of grid instability. It has been reported that sudden, widespread disconnects can exacerbate grid instability rather than help settle it.</p>
<p>Smart inverters, however, provide a greater degree of control and have been designed to help maintain grid stability. One trend in this area is to use synchrophasor measurements to detect and identify a grid instability event, rather than conventional <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_power_point_tracker#Classification">‘perturb-and-observe’</a> methods. The aim is to distinguish between a true island condition and a voltage or frequency disturbance which may benefit from additional power generation by the inverter rather than a disconnect.</p>
<p>Smart inverters can change the power factor. They can input or receive reactive power to manage voltage and power fluctuations, driving voltage up or down depending on immediate requirements. Adaptive volts-amps reactive (VAR) compensation techniques could enable ‘self-healing’ on the grid.</p>
<p>Two-way communications between smart inverter and smart grid not only allow fundamental data on production to be transmitted to the grid operator on a timely basis, but upstream data on voltage and current can help the smart inverter adjust its operation to improve power quality, regulate voltage, and improve grid stability without compromising safety. There are considerable challenges still to overcome in terms of agreeing and evolving national and international technical standards, but this topic is not covered here.</p>
<p>The benefits of the smart inverter over traditional devices have been recognized in Germany, Europe’s largest solar energy producer, where an initiative is underway to convert all solar energy producers’ inverters to smart inverters. Although the cost of smart inverters is slightly higher than traditional systems, the advantages gained in grid balancing and accurate data for planning purposes are considered worthwhile. Key features of smart inverters required by German national standards include power ramping and volt/VAR control, which directly influence improved grid stability.

<p>The chart is a little hard to follow, but the main idea should be clear: whichever experiment we carry out, the results tend to lie on a straight line on this graph. You do get a slightly different slope in one experiment, the &#8220;1% percent CO2 increase per year&#8221; experiment, where only CO2 rises, and much more slowly than it has over the last few decades. All the more realistic scenarios lie in the orange band, and all have about the same slope.</p>
<p>This linear relationship is a useful insight, because it means that for any target ceiling for temperature rise (e.g. the UN&#8217;s commitment to not allow warming to rise more than 2°C above pre-industrial levels), we can easily determine a cumulative emissions budget that corresponds to that temperature. So that brings us to the most important paragraph in the entire report, which occurs towards the end of the summary for policymakers:</p>
<blockquote><p>Limiting the warming caused by anthropogenic CO2 emissions alone with a probability of &gt;33%, &gt;50%, and &gt;66% to less than 2°C since the period 1861–1880, will require cumulative CO2 emissions from all anthropogenic sources to stay between 0 and about 1560 GtC, 0 and about 1210 GtC, and 0 and about 1000 GtC since that period respectively. These upper amounts are reduced to about 880 GtC, 840 GtC, and 800 GtC respectively, when accounting for non-CO2 forcings as in RCP2.6. An amount of 531 [446 to 616] GtC, was already emitted by 2011.</p></blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, this paragraph is a little hard to follow, perhaps because there was <a title="See NYTimes, How To Slice a Global Carbon Pie" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/08/science/how-to-slice-a-global-carbon-pie.html" target="_blank">a major battle over the exact wording of it</a> in the final few hours of inter-governmental review of the &#8220;Summary for Policymakers&#8221;. Several oil states objected to any language that put a fixed limit on our total carbon budget. The compromise was to give several different targets for different levels of risk. </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s unpick them. First notice that the targets in the first sentence are based on looking at CO2 emissions alone; the lower targets in the second sentence take into account other greenhouse gases, and other earth systems feedbacks (e.g. release of methane from melting permafrost), and so are much lower. It&#8217;s these targets that really matter:</p>
<p>&bull; To give us a one third (33%) chance of staying below 2°C of warming over pre-industrial levels, we cannot ever emit more than 880 gigatonnes of carbon. </p>
<p>&bull; To give us a 50% chance, we cannot ever emit more than 840 gigatonnes of carbon.</p>
<p>&bull; To give us a 66% chance, we cannot ever emit more than 800 gigatonnes of carbon.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of industrialization, we have already emitted a little more than 500 gigatonnes. So our remaining budget is somewhere between 300 and 400 gigatonnes of carbon. Existing known fossil fuel reserves are enough <a title="Will Peak Oil Save us from Climate Change?" href="http://www.easterbrook.ca/steve/2009/11/will-peak-oil-save-us-from-climate-change/">to release at least 1000 gigatonnes</a>. New discoveries and unconventional sources will likely more than double this. That leads to one inescapable conclusion:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><em>Most of the remaining fossil fuel reserves must stay buried in the ground.</em></strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve never done that before. There is no political or economic system anywhere in the world currently that can persuade an energy company to leave a valuable fossil fuel resource untapped. There is no government in the world that has demonstrated the ability to forgo the economic wealth from natural resource extraction, for the good of the planet as a whole. We&#8217;re lacking both the political will and the political institutions to achieve this. Finding a way to achieve this presents us with a challenge far bigger than we ever imagined.</p>

<p><strong>(7) To stay below 2 °C of warming, the world must become carbon negative</strong></p>
<p>Only one of the four future scenarios (RCP2.6) shows us staying below the UN&#8217;s commitment to no more than 2 ºC of warming. In RCP2.6, emissions peak soon (within the next decade or so), and then drop fast, under a stronger emissions reduction policy than anyone has ever proposed in international negotiations to date. For example, the post-Kyoto negotiations have looked at targets in the region of 80% reductions in emissions over say a 50 year period. In contrast, the chart below shows something far more ambitious: we need more than 100% emissions reductions. We need to become carbon negative:</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_3957" style="width: 450px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.easterbrook.ca/steve/wp-content/IPCC-AR5-Fig12.46top.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3957" class="size-large wp-image-3957" alt="(Figure 12.46) a) CO2 emissions for the RCP2.6 scenario (black) and three illustrative modified emission pathways leading to the same warming, b) global temperature change relative to preindustrial for the pathways shown in panel (a)." src="https://i2.wp.com/www.easterbrook.ca/steve/wp-content/IPCC-AR5-Fig12.46top-1024x410.png" width="440" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-3957" class="wp-caption-text">(Figure 12.46) a) CO2 emissions for the RCP2.6 scenario (black) and three illustrative modified emission pathways leading to the same warming, b) global temperature change relative to preindustrial for the pathways shown in panel (a).</p></div>
<p>The graph on the left shows four possible CO2 emissions paths that would all deliver the RCP2.6 scenario, while the graph on the right shows the resulting temperature change for these four. They all give similar results for temperature change, but differ in how we go about reducing emissions. For example, the black curve shows CO2 emissions peaking by 2020 at a level barely above today&#8217;s, and then dropping steadily until emissions are below zero by about 2070. Two other curves show what happens if emissions peak higher and later: the eventual reduction has to happen much more steeply. The blue dashed curve offers an implausible scenario, so consider it a thought experiment: if we held emissions constant at today&#8217;s level, we have exactly 30 years left before we would have to instantly reduce emissions to zero forever.</p>
<p>Notice where the zero point is on the scale on that left-hand graph. Ignoring the unrealistic blue dashed curve, all of these pathways require the world to go <em>net carbon negative</em> sometime soon after mid-century. None of the emissions targets currently being discussed by any government anywhere in the world are sufficient to achieve this. We should be talking about how to become carbon negative.</p>
<p>One further detail. The graph above shows the temperature response staying well under 2°C for all four curves, although the uncertainty band reaches up to 2°C. But note that this analysis deals only with CO2. The other greenhouse gases have to be accounted for too, and together they push the temperature change right up to the 2°C threshold. There&#8217;s no margin for error.</p>

					<p><i>guest post by <b><a href="http://www.easterbrook.ca/steve/about/">Steve Easterbrook</a></b></i></p>
<p>In October, I trawled through the final draft of this report, which was released at that time:</p>
<p>&bull; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/"><i>Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis</i></a>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I think are its key messages:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2014/04/07/what-does-the-new-ipcc-report-say-about-climate-change-part-1/#1">The warming is unequivocal</a>.</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2014/04/09/what-does-the-new-ipcc-report-say-about-climate-change-part-2/">Humans caused the majority of it</a>.</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2014/04/10/what-does-the-new-ipcc-report-say-about-climate-change-part-3/">The warming is largely irreversible</a>.</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2014/04/11/what-does-the-new-ipcc-report-say-about-climate-change-part-4/">Most of the heat is going into the oceans</a>.</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2014/04/14/what-does-the-new-ipcc-report-say-about-climate-change-part-5/">Current rates of ocean acidification are unprecedented</a>.</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2014/04/16/what-does-the-new-ipcc-report-say-about-climate-change-part-6/">We have to choose which future we want very soon</a>.</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2014/04/18/what-does-the-new-ipcc-report-say-about-climate-change-part-7/">To stay below 2°C of warming, the world must become carbon negative</a>.</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2014/04/22/what-does-the-new-ipcc-report-say-about-climate-change-part-8/">To stay below 2°C of warming, most fossil fuels must stay buried in the ground</a>.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>I&#8217;ll talk about the first of these here, and the rest in future parts&#8212;click to get to any part you want.  But before I start, a little preamble. </p>
<p>The <a title="Brief history at the IPCC website" href="http://www.ipcc.ch/organization/organization.shtml#.UlNYAxbi28E" target="_blank">IPCC was set up in 1988</a> as a UN intergovernmental body to provide an overview of the science. Its job is to assess what the peer-reviewed science says, in order to inform policymaking, but it is not tasked with making specific policy recommendations. The IPCC and its workings <a title="For an overview of how the IPCC has been smeared, see this post at RealClimate" href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2010/02/ipcc-errors-facts-and-spin/" target="_blank">seem to be widely misunderstood</a> in the media. The dwindling group of people who are still <a title="and by &quot;in denial&quot;, I do mean in denial" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial">in denial</a> about climate change particularly like to indulge in IPCC-bashing, which seems like a classic case of &#8216;blame the messenger&#8217;. The IPCC itself has a very small staff (no more than a dozen or so people). However, the assessment reports are written and reviewed by a very large team of scientists (several thousands), all of whom volunteer their time to work on the reports. The scientists are are organised into three working groups: WG1 focuses on the physical science basis, WG2 focuses on impacts and climate adaptation, and WG3 focuses on how climate mitigation can be achieved.</p>
<p>In October, <a title="Available online at the IPCC website" href="http://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/#.UlQKohbi2KK" target="_blank">the WG1 report was released as a final draft</a>, although it was accompanied by bigger media event around the approval of the final wording on the WG1 &#8220;Summary for Policymakers&#8221;. The final version of the <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/">full WG1 report</a>, plus the <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg2/">WG2</a> and <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg3/">WG3</a> reports, have come out since then.  </p>
<p>I wrote about the WG1 draft in October, but John has solicited this post for <i>Azimuth</i> only now.  By now, the draft I&#8217;m talking about here has undergone some minor editing/correcting, and some of the figures might have ended up re-drawn. Even so, most of the text is unlikely to have changed, and the major findings can be considered final. </p>
<p>In this post and the parts to come I&#8217;ll give my take on the most important findings, along with a key figure to illustrate each.  </p>
<p><a name="1"></a><br />
<strong>(1) The warming is unequivocal</strong></p>
<p>The text of the summary for policymakers says: </p>
<blockquote><p>
Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia. The atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, sea level has risen, and the concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased.
</p></blockquote>

The top panel shows the annual values; the bottom panel shows decadal means. (Note: Anomalies are relative to the mean of 1961-1990).</p></div>
<p>Unfortunately, there has been much play in the press around a silly idea that the warming has &#8220;<a title="See for example, this analysis by Chris Mooney" href="http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2013/09/global-warming-pause-ipcc" target="_blank">paused</a>&#8221; in the last decade. If you squint at the last few years of the top graph, you might be able to convince yourself that the temperature has been nearly flat for a few years, but only if you cherry pick your starting date, and use a period that&#8217;s too short to count as climate. When you look at it in the context of an entire century and longer, such arguments are clearly just wishful thinking.</p>
<p>The other thing to point out here is that the <em>rate</em> of warming is unprecedented: </p>
<blockquote><p>
With very high confidence, the current rates of CO2, CH4 and N2O rise in atmospheric concentrations and the associated radiative forcing are unprecedented with respect to the highest resolution ice core records of the last 22,000 years</p></blockquote>
<p>and there is </p>
<blockquote><p>medium confidence that the rate of change of the observed greenhouse gas rise is also unprecedented compared with the lower resolution records of the past 800,000 years.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, there is nothing in any of the ice core records that is comparable to what we have done to the atmosphere over the last century. The earth has warmed and cooled in the past due to natural cycles, but never anywhere near as fast as modern climate change.</p>

			<div class="textwidget"><p>You can <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics">include math in your comments using LaTeX</a>,  but you need to do it this way:</p>
<p>&#036;latex  E = mc^2&#036;</p>
<p>You need the word 'latex' right after the first dollar sign, and it needs a space after it.  Double dollar signs don't work, and other limitations apply, some described <a href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/latex/">here</a>.  You can't preview comments here, but I'm happy to fix errors.</p>
