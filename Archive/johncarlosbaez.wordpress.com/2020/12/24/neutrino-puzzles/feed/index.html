PART 4.

Let&#039;s express the discussion from PART 3 differently.

We have two complex-linear maps $latex C_u,C_d$ between 3-dimensional unitary spaces; the target space is the same for both maps. We want to classify the possible pairs $latex (C_u,C_d)$ up to three separate unitary basis changes: on each domain and on the common target.

After introducing irrelevant bases everywhere, the task is to determine the orbit space of the following group action of the group $latex U(3)\times U(3)\times U(3)$ on the set $latex X:= \text{End}(\mathbb{C}^3) \times \text{End}(\mathbb{C}^3)$: For $latex A,B\in\text{End}(\mathbb{C}^3)$ and $latex U,V,W\in U(3)$,
$$latex  (U,V,W)\cdot(A,B) = (UAV^{-1},UBW^{-1}) . $$

Let $latex \mathbb{1}$ be the $latex 3\times3$ identity matrix, and let $latex G = (U(3)\times U(3)\times U(3)) / U(1)\cdot(\mathbb{1},\mathbb{1},\mathbb{1})$. The group action of $latex U(3)\times U(3)\times U(3)$ we just considered induces a group action of $latex G$ on $latex X$. We want to determine its orbit space.

We expect the dimension of the orbit space to be the (real) dimension of $latex X$ minus the dimension of $latex G$. That is, $latex 2\cdot2\cdot9 = 36$ minus $latex 3\cdot9 -1 = 26$. I.e., $latex 10$.

Let&#039;s consider the subset $latex X_0$ consisting of all $latex (A,B)\in X$ such that $latex A^*A$ and $latex B^*B$ each have three distinct positive eigenvalues. This is an open dense subset of $latex X$ which is preserved by the action of $latex G$. We expect the orbit space of the action on $latex X_0$ to be 10-dimensional as well.

Experiments show that the SM parameter $latex (C_u,C_d)$ lies in $latex X_0$. Therefore physicists care only about the orbit space of $latex X_0$.

The discussion from PART 3 boils down to the message that this orbit space can be parametrized by six numbers (the quark masses), which can be thought of as the noncompact part of the orbit space; and by the compact part, which can be thought of as the set of possible CKM matrices modulo a suitable group action. Namely the following action of the group $latex G&#039;:= (U(1)^3\times U(1)^3) / U(1)\cdot(\mathbb{1},\mathbb{1})$ on the set $latex U(3)$:
$$latex  (U,V)\cdot A = UAV^{-1} . $$

The expected dimension of the compact part is the dimension of $latex U(3)$ (i.e. $latex 9$) minus the dimension of $latex G&#039;$ (i.e. $latex 5$). Which yields an orbit space of expected dimension $latex 6+4 = 10$.

The whole point of this classification is that the three generation spaces are not identified but considered as separate spaces. This discussion can be found in physics textbooks (up to differences in notation and language, of course), for instance &lt;i&gt;O. Nachtmann: Elementary particle physics. Concepts and phenomena&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.de/books?id=Co3_CAAAQBAJ&#038;pg=PA362&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;pp. 362--364&lt;/a&gt;.

We should continue with a translation of &quot;flavor eigenstates&quot; into the language above...]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  The PMNS matrix for the leptons is analogous to the CKM matrix for the quarks, so let’s consider only the latter.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One thing that I&amp;apos;ve learnt over the course of the past few days (and discussed somewhat in the comments to Part 2 of these neutrino posts) is that flavour is defined differently for neutrinos than it is for quarks.  For quarks and charged leptons, flavour states are mass states; for neutrinos, they&amp;apos;re not.  There are practical and historical reasons for this difference, but it is ultimately an arbitrary choice.  So when you translate this discussion about quarks into a discussion about leptons, you turn u,c,b into e,μ,τ but d,s,t into ν₁,ν₂,ν₃.  The PMNS matrix expresses νₑ etc as linear combinations of ν₁,ν₂,ν₃; analogously, the CMK matrix expresses d′,s′,t′ as linear combinations of d,s,t.

So the real distinction is not between mass states and flavour states but between mass states and weak states.  For neutrinos, the flavour states are defined to be the weak states; for everything else, they&amp;apos;re defined to be the mass states.  The mass states, of course, are eigenstates of mass; the weak states are eigenstates of mass-after-emitting-or-absorbing-a-W-boson.  That is, an interaction mediated by a W boson turns a mass state into a weak state or vice versa.  It turns flavour states into flavour states if you&#039;re talking about leptons, but not if you&#039;re talking about quarks; this is only because the conventions are different, not the underlying mathematics and physics.]]></description>

PART 3.

Now the Yukawa terms.

Let $latex \phi$ denote the Higgs field. There are two Yukawa quark terms. One involves $latex q,u,\phi$, the other one involves $latex q,d,\phi$. Only the generation tensor factors are relevant for our discussion. The Higgs field does not have a generation factor, hence can be ignored here.

We just need sesquilinear forms $latex C&#039;_u: V_q\times V_u\to\C$ and $latex C&#039;_d: V_q\times V_d\to\C$ to write down the Yukawa terms. Since $latex V_q$ is equipped with a (sesquilinear) scalar product $latex \langle.,.\rangle$ (this is not the bilinear form from PART 2; clash of notation), we can identify $latex C&#039;_u$ with a $latex \mathbb{C}$-linear map $latex C_u: V_u \to V_q$ via $latex C&#039;_u(v,w) = \langle v,C_u(w)\rangle$. Analogously $latex C&#039;_d$ corresponds to a $latex \mathbb{C}$-linear map $latex C_d: V_d \to V_q$.

These two maps $latex C_u,C_d$ are parameters of the SM Lagrangian and determine the Yukawa quark terms. (I will not describe these terms in detail. They involve invariant trilinear forms on the non-generation tensor factors. Again these trilinear forms are essentially unique.)

(The Yukawa terms are the only renormalizable two-fermions-one-Higgs Lagrangians which we can form from $latex q,u,d,\phi$ and which are allowed by general symmetry principles. The two maps $latex C_u,C_d$ parametrise all possibilities!)

Now we can figure out which decompositions of the vector spaces $latex V_u,V_d,V_q$ these maps induce.

Via the scalar products we get adjoints $latex C_u^*: V_q\to V_u$ and $latex C_d^*: V_q\to V_d$. The obvious decompositions are:


the $latex C_d^*C_d$-eigenspace decomposition of $latex V_d$ (the corresponding eigenvalues are physically the squares of the down-quark masses);
the $latex C_dC_d^*$-eigenspace decomposition of $latex V_q$ (with the same eigenvalues as $latex C_d^*C_d$);
the $latex C_u^*C_u$-eigenspace decomposition of $latex V_u$ (the corresponding eigenvalues are physically the squares of the up-quark masses);
the $latex C_uC_u^*$-eigenspace decomposition of $latex V_q$ (with the same eigenvalues as $latex C_u^*C_u$).


(If $latex V_u,V_d,V_q$ were somehow identified, we would get many additional endomorphisms and hence many other decompositions from the Lagrangian parameters $latex C_u,C_d$!)

In the physically relevant (and mathematically generic) case, all eigenvalues are distinct. Hence (in this case) each decomposition is an orthogonal decomposition into three one-dimensional subspaces.

Now we have two orthogonal decompositions of $latex V_q$ into one-dimensional subspaces: one decomposition $latex V^u_{q,1}\oplus V^u_{q,2}\oplus V^u_{q,3}$ induced by $latex C_u$, the other $latex V^d_{q,1}\oplus V^d_{q,2}\oplus V^d_{q,3}$ by $latex C_d$. Let&#039;s say $latex V^u_{q,i}$ is the eigenspace for the eigenvalue $latex m_{u,i}^2$, where $latex 0 &#060; m_{u,1} &#060; m_{u,2} &#060; m_{u,3}$; analogously with $latex d$ instead of $latex u$.

If we fix in each of these subspaces a vector of norm 1, then we get a matrix $latex \textbf{V}\in U(3)$ describing the basis change from the $latex d$-basis to the $latex u$-basis. Each such matrix is called a &#034;CKM matrix&#034;. There are many such matrices, because there are many ways to fix vectors of norm 1 in the eigenspaces: multiplying each of the six chosen vectors with an element of $latex U(1)$ yields another possible choice. Each CKM matrix arising in this way describes the same physics: only the eigenspace decompositions are physically/operationally meaningful.

[In PART 1, the numbering of my two-item ordered HTML list got lost in the translation.]

PART 2.

Let&#039;s start with the first type of fermion-involving Lagrangian. (Is there a standard name for these terms, analogous to &quot;Yukawa terms&quot;?)

The (real-valued) bilinear form $latex \langle.,.\rangle$ is determined by a sesquilinear form $latex B_\psi: V_\psi\times V_\psi \to \mathbb{C}$, as follows: $latex \psi$ is a section in the associated bundle $latex E_\psi$ constructed from the representation $latex \rho_\psi\otimes 1$ on $S_\psi\otimes V_\psi$, and $latex \mathcal{D}^A\psi$ is a section in another associated bundle constructed from a representation $latex \rho&#039;_\psi\otimes 1$ of $latex H$ on some tensor product $latex S&#039;_\psi\otimes V_\psi$. There is a nonzero sesquilinear form $latex b_\psi: S_\psi\times S&#039;_\psi \to \mathbb{C}$ which is invariant under simultaneous application of $latex \rho_\psi,\rho&#039;_\psi$ on the left-hand resp.\ right-hand side. This sesquilinear form is unique up to multiplication with a complex number. We may pick any such form without loss of generality. From $latex b_\psi$ and $latex B_\psi$ we get in the obvious way a sesquilinear form $latex (S_\psi\otimes V_\psi) \times (S&#039;_\psi\otimes V_\psi) \to \mathbb{C}$ whose real part gives us the bilinear form $latex \langle.,.\rangle$.

Without loss of generality we may assume that $latex B_\psi$ is hermitian: The antihermitian part yields a Lagrangian term that vanishes due to a partial integration argument (as long as we consider for instance compactly supported fields).

We can regard the hermitian forms $latex B_u,B_d,B_q$ as parameters of the SM Lagrangian. But, as an experimental fact, each of them is positive definite, i.e. a scalar product, for the universe we live in. (What does a universe look like where they have other signatures?)

Since all scalar products are isomorphic, they produce the same physics. In this sense, there is no need to include $latex B_u,B_d,B_q$ in the list of SM parameters. (Alternatively, we can include their isomorphism classes [i.e. their signatures] as a finite-valued parameter of the SM.)

To summarize PART 2: The a priori structureless generation vector spaces $latex V_u,V_d,V_q$ obtain scalar products from the first type of fermion-involving SM Lagrangians. They still have no decomposition into one-dimensional subspaces at this point, and there are no identifications between them.

<p>The (real-valued) bilinear form <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle.%2C.%5Crangle&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;langle.,.&#92;rangle" class="latex" /> is determined by a sesquilinear form <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B_%5Cpsi%3A+V_%5Cpsi%5Ctimes+V_%5Cpsi+%5Cto+%5Cmathbb%7BC%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B_&#92;psi: V_&#92;psi&#92;times V_&#92;psi &#92;to &#92;mathbb{C}" class="latex" />, as follows: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpsi&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;psi" class="latex" /> is a section in the associated bundle <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E_%5Cpsi&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="E_&#92;psi" class="latex" /> constructed from the representation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho_%5Cpsi%5Cotimes+1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;rho_&#92;psi&#92;otimes 1" class="latex" /> on $S_\psi\otimes V_\psi$, and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BD%7D%5EA%5Cpsi&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathcal{D}^A&#92;psi" class="latex" /> is a section in another associated bundle constructed from a representation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho%27_%5Cpsi%5Cotimes+1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;rho&#039;_&#92;psi&#92;otimes 1" class="latex" /> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="H" class="latex" /> on some tensor product <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%27_%5Cpsi%5Cotimes+V_%5Cpsi&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="S&#039;_&#92;psi&#92;otimes V_&#92;psi" class="latex" />. There is a nonzero sesquilinear form <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_%5Cpsi%3A+S_%5Cpsi%5Ctimes+S%27_%5Cpsi+%5Cto+%5Cmathbb%7BC%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="b_&#92;psi: S_&#92;psi&#92;times S&#039;_&#92;psi &#92;to &#92;mathbb{C}" class="latex" /> which is invariant under simultaneous application of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho_%5Cpsi%2C%5Crho%27_%5Cpsi&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;rho_&#92;psi,&#92;rho&#039;_&#92;psi" class="latex" /> on the left-hand resp.\ right-hand side. This sesquilinear form is unique up to multiplication with a complex number. We may pick any such form without loss of generality. From <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_%5Cpsi&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="b_&#92;psi" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B_%5Cpsi&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B_&#92;psi" class="latex" /> we get in the obvious way a sesquilinear form <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28S_%5Cpsi%5Cotimes+V_%5Cpsi%29+%5Ctimes+%28S%27_%5Cpsi%5Cotimes+V_%5Cpsi%29+%5Cto+%5Cmathbb%7BC%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="(S_&#92;psi&#92;otimes V_&#92;psi) &#92;times (S&#039;_&#92;psi&#92;otimes V_&#92;psi) &#92;to &#92;mathbb{C}" class="latex" /> whose real part gives us the bilinear form <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle.%2C.%5Crangle&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;langle.,.&#92;rangle" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>Without loss of generality we may assume that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B_%5Cpsi&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B_&#92;psi" class="latex" /> is hermitian: The antihermitian part yields a Lagrangian term that vanishes due to a partial integration argument (as long as we consider for instance compactly supported fields).</p>
<p>We can regard the hermitian forms <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B_u%2CB_d%2CB_q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B_u,B_d,B_q" class="latex" /> as parameters of the SM Lagrangian. But, as an experimental fact, each of them is positive definite, i.e. a scalar product, for the universe we live in. (What does a universe look like where they have other signatures?)</p>
<p>Since all scalar products are isomorphic, they produce the same physics. In this sense, there is no need to include <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B_u%2CB_d%2CB_q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B_u,B_d,B_q" class="latex" /> in the list of SM parameters. (Alternatively, we can include their isomorphism classes [i.e. their signatures] as a finite-valued parameter of the SM.)</p>
<p>To summarize PART 2: The a priori structureless generation vector spaces <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V_u%2CV_d%2CV_q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="V_u,V_d,V_q" class="latex" /> obtain scalar products from the first type of fermion-involving SM Lagrangians. They still have no decomposition into one-dimensional subspaces at this point, and there are no identifications between them.</p>

Apologies for the delayed reply. It&#039;s still incomplete, and I see that Toby Bartels has by now said some things similar to what I wanted to say. Anyway, here is my take on the issue.

First one remark. You wrote: &quot;Let me start by doing it operationally, as if I were an experimentalist. I&#039;m sure you will find this infuriating [...]&quot; Quite the contrary. If someone doesn&#039;t understand a physical concept, operational explanations are ultimately the only ones that can help. But I think we can figure this out without getting too operational.

You said: &quot;If you succeed in doing the translation, please explain it to me!&quot; I&#039;ll try. I hope to avoid the old trap of &quot;mathematicians translating something into their own language and henceforth it&#039;s something completely different&quot;.

PART 1.

Let $latex H = \text{Spin}^0(3,1)\times S(U(2)\times U(3))$. In the Standard Model (SM), fermionic fields of type $latex \psi$ correspond to sections in a certain complex vector bundle $latex E_\psi$ over spacetime, namely the associated vector bundle of some $latex H$-principal bundle via a suitable representation $latex \rho_\psi\otimes 1$ of $latex H$ on a tensor product $latex S_\psi\otimes V_\psi$. Here $latex \rho_\psi$ is a representation of $latex H$ on a complex vector space $latex S_\psi$; and $latex 1$ is the trivial representation of $latex H$ on a 3-dimensional complex vector space $latex V_\psi$, which I&#039;ll call the &quot;generation space&quot; of $latex \psi$. In the following discussion we do not have to care too much about $latex \rho_\psi$ and $latex S_\psi$. (You know what they are.)

The PMNS matrix for the leptons is analogous to the CKM matrix for the quarks, so let&#039;s consider only the latter. The relevant fermion types are the (right-handed) up-quark field $latex u$ (in all three generations: up, charm, top), the (right-handed) down-quark field $latex d$ (in all three generations: down, strange, bottom), and the (left-handed) quark-field $latex q$ (a &quot;doublet&quot; in physics lingo).

The generation spaces $latex V_u,V_d,V_q$ are a priori not equipped with any structure: no scalar product, no decomposition into one-dimensional subspaces, no identifications between them. (You said that the three spaces should be identified. I hope to convince you that they shouldn&#039;t.)

The (renormalizable part of the) SM Lagrangian contains two types of terms involving fermions:


Terms that describe interactions of two fermions (of the same type $latex \psi$) with a gauge boson. Schematically they look like $latex \langle\psi,\mathcal{D}^A\psi\rangle$, where $latex \mathcal{D}^A$ is a certain first-order differential operator constructed from the gauge-boson field $latex A$ (a &quot;twisted Dirac operator&quot; in mathematical lingo). More about the bilinear form $latex \langle.,.\rangle$ below.
Yukawa terms that describe interactions of two fermions (in our quark case: $latex q$ and either $latex u$ or $latex d$) and one Higgs boson.

Wow, that&#039;s cool!
