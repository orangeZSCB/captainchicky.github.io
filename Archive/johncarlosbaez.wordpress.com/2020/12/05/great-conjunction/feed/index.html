					<description><![CDATA[Yesterday, 21 December 2021, Lisa and I sat out in the driveway, drinking wine and eating chili almonds while admiring the Great Conjunction.  Here&#039;s a picture I took of it with an ordinary camera at 7:22 Pacific Time:

The elliptical shape of Saturn is actually due to the rings of Saturn, though it&#039;s hard to tell.

Here&#039;s a much better picture:

I don&#039;t know.  But you&#039;re making me wonder if there&#039;s anything interesting that comes of letting time be complex, analytically continuing the planet&#039;s paths to functions defined on some subset of the complex plane, and considering &quot;complex conjunctions&quot;---i.e. conjunctions that happen at complex times?

Letting time be complex is a big deal in statistical mechanics and quantum field theory, but I haven&#039;t thought about &quot;complex celestial mechanics&quot;.  Probably someone has!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[John was too kind to mention, the case of a real cubic crossing the x-axis zero times actually never happens.

It spurs the reflection that according to Bezout&#039;s theorem, two cubics (in the broader sense i.e f(x,y)=0, g(x,y)=0 where f and g are bivariate polynomials of order 3) cross 3x3=9 times. Some of the crossings might be imaginary, some might be points at infinity, some might be repeated roots. A well-known example is two circles. These can have at most two real crossings but also share two imaginary points at infinity. In homogeneous coordinates these are (1,i,0) and (1,-i,0).

So: if we approximate a planet&#039;s apparent path in a small part of the sky as a cubic curve, do 9 associated conjunctions ever occur?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Toby created some nice pictures answering the Puzzle.   Let me show them here, though it&#039;s better to click on these pictures and go to his pages!

When studying some basic aspects of great conjunctions, we might as well be studying the space of pairs of curves $latex y = f(x)$ in the plane where $latex f$ is a cubic polynomial.  There&#039;s an open set of pairs that intersect in 3 points:

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.desmos.com/calculator/4tppmmwndy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/astronomical/triple_conjunction.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

These are triple conjunctions.

There&#039;s also a set of pairs that intersect in 2 points:

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.desmos.com/calculator/efu3lzzxfr&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/astronomical/double_conjunction.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

These are double conjunctions.  But &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; set has empty interior, so double conjunctions are rare.]]></description>

Right!   It&#039;s theoretically possible to have a double conjunction; the probability of a &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt; double conjunction is zero, but if Saturn and Jupiter cross by each other twice in very rapid succession that&#039;s one conjunction for all practical purposes, so we can get a double conjunction that way... or another way, where once Saturn and Jupiter don&#039;t &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; cross each other, but come so close it counts as a conjunction for all practical purposes.

All of this can be thought of as math involving the space of pairs of cubic curves $latex y = f(x)$, and how they can intersect.  Pairs with a single intersection form an open set $latex X.$  Pairs with a triple intersection form an open set $latex Y.$   But the set

$latex \overline{X \cup Y} - X - Y$

contains pairs that intersect twice.]]></description>

If Jupiter and Saturn were point particles, then double would almost never happen (by the mathematicians&#039; meaning of ‘almost never’, which means 0% of the time).  This is what my comment about tangents is about.  But since they have some angular width, double should be possible.  But that doesn&#039;t mean that it ever happens in practice.]]></description>

Ps. I see John already knows all this. The answer to the puzzle is, if you win a race from behind but the other guy was briefly ahead, you have to overtake, be overtaken, overtake again. Or more cycles but it&#039;s always an odd number.

There&#039;s probably a refinement to this. Was John&#039;s &quot;more common&quot; (triple than double) the mathematical &quot;more&quot; (including &quot;double never happens&quot;) or the common person&#039;s &quot;more&quot; (double happens but not that often) ?]]></description>
