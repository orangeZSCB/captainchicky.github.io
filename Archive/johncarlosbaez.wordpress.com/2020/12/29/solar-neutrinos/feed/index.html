					<description><![CDATA[By the way, the solution to the riddle of the 2 factor is easy done for 2 neutrino species...
Take: $latex A=\exp(ix/2)$, $latex B=\exp(iy/2)$. And suppose only two neutrino especies, mixing as $latex \Psi&#039;=\sum_{i=1}^2 U_i\Psi$, and assume for simplicity that the PMNS mixing matrix is the unit or Kronecker delta matrix (ironically speaking, it happens to be aproximately true for quarks not for neutrinos or leptons) 
The transition matrix would be roughly

$latex \langle i\vert j\rangle\rightarrow \mathcal{A}(i,j)=\vert \langle i\vert j\rangle \vert^2. $

Then, simple complex calculus provides

$latex \langle i\vert j\rangle^2\propto 4\cos^2(x-y)/2\sim 4\sin^2(x-y)/2. $

where the last step is true up to a phase...Take $latex x=m_1^2/2L$, $latex y=m_2^2/2L$, then you get roughly

$latex (x-y)/2\sim \Delta m^2 c^3/4E\hbar=1/L_{\nu} =k_\nu$.

In the complete 3 flavor (or N-flavor) case, you get for the probability something like

$latex \delta_{ij}-4Re (B_{ij})\sin^2(\Delta m_{ij} c^2L/4E\hbar)+2Im (C_{ij})\sin^2(\Delta m_{ij} c^2L/2E\hbar)$

Indeed, to consider $latex \Delta m^2c^3 L/4E\hbar$ as the basic phase or $latex \Delta m^2c^3 L/2E\hbar$ is not too important, since the point is phase differences! And the point that makes all this thing important is that massless neutrinos (Weyl fermions) can not explain the neutrino oscillations. I did as undergraduate a work about this for my Astrophysics class...The old SM died the day we discovered neutrino oscillations. They are evidence for new physics beyond the Standard Model! Indeed, not only the spectrum is mysterious, as well it is the number of massive neutrinos! What? Yes, in principle since we do measure mass differences, it could show up that one neutrino flavor could be indeed massless. I think. I have not read about this topic since my graduated ages...In principle, I believe, a quasidegenerated neutrino spectrum is &quot;almost&quot; excluded. And at least, there should be 2 massive neutrino species (there can be 3 as well, of course). People have been trying models of neutrino masses through symmetries of the PMNS matrix (complementary somehow to the CKM quark mixing matrix). Before the measurement of $latex \theta_{13}$ tribimaximal matrices were preferred for mixing models of neutrinos, I am not sure of what is the state-of-art of this stuff right now...I should read but my desktop computer is apparently dead, and my current laptop is also 7 years old, so I am minimizing workflows until new PC comes in...

In summary, the observation of neutrino oscillations give up Weyl neutrino for the 3 flavor states, since we measure differences between flavor squared masses of flavor states. Moreover, the seesaw mechanism provides a way to explain neutrino masses BUT the upper scale can not be Planck scale or even the GUT scale, ...Using seesaw Type I you can guess that arount 1-100 PeV some new physics should arise due to neutrinos (maybe PeV scale Right-Handed superheavy neutrinos / dark matter? No one knows...Cosmic rays and other extreme astronomy is important there for those neutrino/cosmic ray events). Finally, Majorana phases are relevant but could be harder to detect than expected (some recent papers on the arXiv warn us about it...). Hard work is ahead of us...]]></description>

That may be why I kept up as well as I did! I feel that I understand SR okay. (Enough to presume to write blog posts about it!)

I&#039;ve read your recent neutrino posts, and the comments, with great interest. I had no idea the flavor and mass eigenstates were so different, let alone about the possibility of the masses being inverted. (I agreed with your comment it would be weird if that were so, and I saw the comments to the effect that we&#039;re now pretty sure it&#039;s not.)

I rather like that the SM still has its own mysteries! ;)]]></description>

Hmm, my instinctive reaction to that claim is suspicion.

In the last few weeks I&#039;ve taken to browsing the arXiv on selected aspects of particle physics.  It&#039;s amazing what a range of stuff there is.   Searching for the string &quot;neutrino mass matrix&quot; gets 960 hits.  One hopes that the better ideas get amplified, but I keep hoping for an unnoticed gem.]]></description>

Thanks for the long comment!  I got pulled into learning a bit more neutrino physics because I&#039;ve been thinking about &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2020/11/13/octonions-and-the-standard-model/&quot;&gt;octonions and the Standard Model&lt;/a&gt; and I realized I should learn more about the trickiest corner of the Standard Model: neutrinos!

&lt;blockquote&gt;
With respect to neutrinos, my master thesis topic 10 years ago, there is a relatively unknown interaction called coherent neutrino-nuclei scattering, mediated by neutral current interactions (via Z boson interchanges!) whose interaction cross-section is proportional to the Fermi constant squared and the so-called weak charge. It was detected, despite its tininess, by the COHERENT collaboration.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That&#039;s incredibly cool.  I&#039;d vaguely heard about that, which is why I wrote

&lt;blockquote&gt;
To keep things simple, let’s assume our electron neutrino gets out of the Sun without anything happening to it. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But I should learn more about it sometime.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I also have some posts about neutrino and beyond neutrino physics at my blog, but I will allow for eager readers to explore for them.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I&#039;ll check them out.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Many people bet that neutrinos, at least SM neutrinos, are Dirac particles, despite the fact it introduces the little hierarchy problem (or why neutrinos masses are so low as compared with any other SM fermion)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I guess I bet this too.  The miraculous similarity between quarks and leptons seems too good to be just &lt;i&gt;partially&lt;/i&gt; true; since quarks don&#039;t seem to have a Majorana mass it seems sad to spoil the similarity by giving neutrinos a Majorana mass, even it helps solve a &quot;hierarchy problem&quot;.  Since we don&#039;t really understand anything about why particles have the masses they do, it seems a bit risky to postulate new physics to get them to have masses on the right order of magnitude without fine-tuning.

Anyway, all this reasoning, including mine here, is very hand-wavy.  So I don&#039;t feel very certain about any of these things.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There are about 411 photons/m³ of the CMB recombination event, but also about 411/4 neutrinos/m³ of the CMB time! They have, asumming SM only physics, a current temperature around 2 K (more precisely about 1.945 K if T(CMB) is taken 2.725 K).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nice!  I had fun reading some papers about the entropy of the universe:

&#8226; Paul Frampton, Stephen D. H. Hsu, Thomas W. Kephart and David Reeb,&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/0801.1847&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;What is the entropy of the universe?&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Classical and Quantum Gravity&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;26&lt;/b&gt; (2009), 145005.

&#8226; Chas A. Egan and Charles H. Lineweaver, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/0909.3983&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;A 
larger estimate of the entropy of the universe&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;i&gt;The Astrophysical Journal&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;710&lt;/b&gt; (2010), 1825.

The first paper estimates the entropy of the observable universe at very roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;102&lt;/sup&gt; bits.  The second estimates it at very roughly 5 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;104&lt;/sup&gt; bits.   The difference is due to an increased estimate of the number of supermassive black holes: that is, black holes of masses at least 10 million times that of the Sun, living at the centers of galaxies.  These dominate the entropy of the universe!

But neutrinos also play a big role.  Measured in bits, here&#039;s how different things contribute to the entropy of the observable universe:

&#8226; stars: 10&lt;sup&gt;81&lt;/sup&gt; bits.

&#8226; interstellar and intergalactic gas and dust: 10&lt;sup&gt;82&lt;/sup&gt; bits.

&#8226; gravitons: 10&lt;sup&gt;88&lt;/sup&gt; bits.

&#8226; neutrinos: 10&lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt; bits.

&#8226; photons: 10&lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt; bits.

&#8226; stellar black holes: 10&lt;sup&gt;98&lt;/sup&gt; bits.

&#8226; supermassive black holes: 5 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;104&lt;/sup&gt; bits.]]></description>

<p>&bull; stars: 10<sup>81</sup> bits.</p>
<p>&bull; interstellar and intergalactic gas and dust: 10<sup>82</sup> bits.</p>
<p>&bull; gravitons: 10<sup>88</sup> bits.</p>
<p>&bull; neutrinos: 10<sup>90</sup> bits.</p>
<p>&bull; photons: 10<sup>90</sup> bits.</p>
<p>&bull; stellar black holes: 10<sup>98</sup> bits.</p>
<p>&bull; supermassive black holes: 5 &times; 10<sup>104</sup> bits.</p>

Great, thanks!  I&#039;d always wondered why we know the differences of squares of masses of neutrinos much better than their masses, so it was fun to work through this.  It turns out that&#039;s more about special relativity than quantum mechanics, though a little quantum mechanics comes into play.]]></description>

Thanks for putting me straight. I admit I glossed over the details of the calculation and just assumed that the reason you worked out the time experienced by the neutrino was because you needed it later on. It might help others avoid making the same mistake if you were to add something like &quot;(Working this out was just for fun - it&#039;s not used in the calculations below.)&quot; after you say &quot;it&#039;s about a 1/6 of a millisecond&quot;.]]></description>

Thanks!

BTW, I recently stumbled on this interesting, but possibly dated, paper that seems to raise the possibility that &lt;em&gt;chirality&lt;/em&gt; oscillations, in addition to the flavour oscillations, could help explain some observations:

The latest, best data from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nu-fit.org/?q=node/228#label10&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;NuFit 5.0 2020&lt;/a&gt; says that $latex \Delta m_{12}^2$ is $latex 7.42 \cdot 10^{-5} \; \textrm{keV}^2/c^4$, with one-&#963; error bars of 0.2. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nu-fit.org/?q=node/12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;NuFit&lt;/a&gt; is a website solely devoted to your neutrino data needs.    So I&#039;ll redo my calculation with that value.

By the way, the three-&#963; range for this quantity goes from $latex 6.82$ to $latex 8.04 \cdot 10^{-5}  \; \textrm{keV}^2/c^4$, showing how hard it is to measure these things!  We&#039;re not even sure of the first decimal, though it&#039;s probably 7.]]></description>
