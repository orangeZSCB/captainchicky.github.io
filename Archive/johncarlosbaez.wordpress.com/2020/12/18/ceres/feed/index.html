					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Today I found out about the Ceres investment management consortium from Azimuth. The big news from this organisation is that as of 11 December 2020, 30 investment managers responsible for the stewardship of 7 trillion USD in assets (in 2020 terms) have committed to this particular agreement. Essentially this amounts to a commitment to ensuring that all assets under their management are zero emission by 2050 – which implies commitment to a roadmap and vision to get there from here, sitting at the end of 2020. Furthermore, there is a recognition that committing to preventing a further 1.5C increase in temperature is very important, and this is part of this commitment. [&#8230;]]]></description>
