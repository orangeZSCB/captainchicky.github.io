Thanks, this is great!   Now I&#039;m becoming a bit less terrified and a bit more fascinated by this subject.

At some point I&#039;ll post a blog article about the gamma ray burster section of the &quot;open questions in physics&quot; FAQ.  I&#039;ll also post one about fast radio bursts.   I will probably many more questions then!

Right now, alas, it&#039;s the first week of class and I have to knuckle down a bit.  But I know what I want to read about.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  Of course there are even bigger open questions in e.g. neutron star and black hole physics, connections w/ GWs, testing GR, cosmology etc. that GRBs can be used as a tool to help study.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Can you list a few of the &#039;biggest&#039; of these bigger open questions?   I&#039;m hoping &#039;big&#039; means not just &#039;complicated&#039; but also &#039;fundamental&#039; and &#039;exciting&#039;.  The open questions FAQ is supposed to focus on really deep, exciting questions; anyone who gets serious about studying them will wind up needing to learn about a lot of smaller, more technical but also more manageable questions.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2020/12/26/neutrino-puzzles-part-2/#comment-168621&quot;&gt;John Baez&lt;/a&gt;.

Here&#039;s a few open questions, biased obviously towards what I think about, but poorly attempting to mind-model my colleagues as well:

1) What is the actual radiation emission process for the prompt (read: gamma) emission. Is it synchrotron cooling? synchrotron self-Compton? compton upscattering of thermal photons? other?
2) What is the short GRB &quot;extended emission&quot; and does it come from a post-merger non-BH remnant like a super/hypermassive magnetar?
3) What is the precise jet launching mechanism? Jet angular structure? What fraction of progenitor scenarios successfully launch a jet? Does the particle acceleration mechanism also produce high energy neutrinos? What processes drove the 1.6 second delay between merger and GRB in GW 170817? Is this delay ubiquitous?
4) What fraction of the apparent short GRBs are actually relatively local, but extragalactic (read: &#060; ~30 Mpc), Giant Magnetar Flares, and not cosmological compact object mergers? (wait for a press release next week)
5) Are the Soft Gamma Repeater sources also prolific producers of Fast Radio Bursts (see Swift discovered https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SGR_1935%2B2154)
6) Can collapsars also efficiently generate the r-process elements? (like the NS mergers can)
7) Are there other progenitors/other source classes of GRB-like phenomena? So far we&#039;ve found TDEs, exploding stars, colliding NSs, NS quakes, red dwarf flares....  Can NS-BH mergers generate GRBs like their NS-NS brethren?  can the earliest massive (pop III) stars generate GRBs?
8) Is the TeV emission from GRBs ubiquitous and only preferentially detected from nearby sources?

I &lt;em&gt;tried&lt;/em&gt; to stick to questions on GRB phenomenology itself, and there are certainly things I am leaving out. Of course there are even bigger open questions in e.g. neutron star and black hole physics, connections w/ GWs, testing GR, cosmology etc. that GRBs can be used as a tool to help study.  These are some of the most exciting areas in high energy astro right now, in my opinion.

Fast Radio Bursts are in a similar position now to what GRBs were when you wrote your original summary.

Might be helpful to peruse the schedule of one of the last major pre-covid GRB conferences:

Let me know if anything isn&#039;t clear, or if you are interested in more direct physics questions.]]></description>

Thanks---that&#039;s very helpful!   I know that a huge amount of progress has happened with gamma ray bursters in the last decade, but I don&#039;t really understand it: I just read news stories here and there, so I don&#039;t have a good picture of the current picture.  So this is one of the sections I&#039;m the most scared of updating... but it needs to be done, and I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll be fun when I get into it.

Can you list a few of what experts consider to be the biggest open questions?   That&#039;s what I need to write about.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yes, the GRB section is in need of an update, if that&#039;s your goal, as it seems you wrote it before the launch of Swift (+ then Fermi), which revolutionized the field (~1500 afterglows from Swift to date), and ended up settling many questions. In addition, GRBs have since been detected at increasingly higher energies (at GeVs with Fermi/LAT) and then at TeV energies starting ~2 years ago with the ground-based Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IACT) like MAGIC and HESS following Swift triggers.

The origin of the two classes is pretty well established at this point (long:collapsar/hypernova, short: compact object merger), and Swift has discovered a 3rd (ultra-long) class, which seems to be made up of some particularly super giant star classes and even the occassional Tidal Disruption Event. Most of these inferences came from detailed afterglow studies, population modelling and contextual evidence based on host galaxy properties, although obviously the GW detection of GW170817 coincident with GRB 170817 solidly confirmed the compact object merger progenitor hypothesis for at least that short GRB.

The hope of using GRBs themselves as standard candles (like SN Ia) with which to do higher redshift cosmology/Hubble constant mesurements hasn&#039;t really panned out due to the extremely large event-to-event variability and still uncertain microphysics. Neither has the hope to see Lorentz violation in GRB spectra (obviously).

Most attention nowadays concentrates in two areas: 
1) detecting very high redshift bursts (highest so far is a Swift burst at z=9) in order to probe the Epoch of Reionization and the formation/death of the first population of massive stars (as yet undetected Pop III stars: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_population#Population_III_stars) and 
2) finding very nearby (z&#060;&#060;0.1)  short bursts that can have detectable gravitational wave signals associated with their compact object merger. This was previously thought unlikely, as the (beamed) event rates in such a small local volume are low and the beam/jet opening angle small, but GW/GRB 170817 showed that for sufficiently nearby events the GRB can actually be detected appreciably off the jet axis (~30 deg), thus driving up the joint event rate, albeit with 3-4 order of magnitude less luminous in gamma-rays. 
So significant effort (from myself and many others) is going in to deep searches for faint short bursts, which then seed targeted searches for GWs on the LIGO/Virgo side, and vice versa.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  Where did you read this?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Physics StackExchange, mostly.  The answer at https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/76849/ explains that it&amp;apos;s just a convention to say that the weak and mass states of up-type quarks and charged leptons are the same, how we could have made this convention for down-type quarks and neutrinos instead, why we have the freedom to make this convention, and why we could make both conventions simultaneously (at least for leptons) if neutrinos were massless.  Similarly, it&amp;apos;s a convention to say that the flavour states are the mass states for the down-type quarks but the weak states for the neutrinos.  Much of this is also at https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/135441/ where it&amp;apos;s also explained why the conventions for quarks and neutrinos, while confusingly different, are each reasonable in their own way.

At this point, my thoughts are as follows:  In theory, the most natural states are the mass states, which (as Vanadium noted on the Physics Forums, in an excerpt that you quoted in a comment on the other neutrino puzzle post) are the only ones that are truly particle states in the sense that they have plane-wave solutions as free fields.  In the interaction picture, mass states evolve to mass states in strong and electromagnetic interactions (and presumably also in gravitational ones), and even in weak interactions mediated by Z bosons, but not in weak interactions mediated by W bosons.  The two mixing matrices describe this interaction in the basis of mass states.

This allows us to define &lt;em&gt;weak&lt;/em&gt; states as the states that arise from a mass state through an interaction mediated by a W.  Now, because this changes the electric charge, people want to change the name of the particle, which works out because they come in generations.  So we define the down weak state as what you get when the up mass state emits a positive W (or absorbs a negative one), the electron neutrino weak state as what you get when the electron mass state emits a negative W (or absorbs a positive one), etc.  This means that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; six quarks and &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; six leptons have both a mass state and a weak state, which are all different.

However, everybody ignores the weak states of the up-like quarks and of the charged leptons, because it&amp;apos;s never helpful to use the weak state on &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; ends of an interaction.  People also take the weak states of the neutrinos as the main ones and describe the mass states as superpositions of the weak states, even though they still take the mass states of the charged leptons and of the quarks (both up-like and down-like) as the main ones and describe the weak states (when they mention them at all) as superpositions of the mass states.

The reason that neutrinos are treated differently is that we are pretty much only interested in them as something that results from an interaction with a W boson.  Charged leptons and especially quarks get involved in a lot more stuff, but neutrinos don&amp;apos;t do much else.  It&amp;apos;s more convenient to be able to ignore mixing when working with leptons and only have to deal with it when working with quarks.  Except that you then get this fictitious force of neutrino oscillation; that&amp;apos;s where the bubble under the wallpaper went.]]></description>

Very interesting stuff, Toby.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  Incidentally, as I&#039;ve been reading more about generation-mixing, I see that flavour eigenstates are the same as mass eigenstates for quarks, but this is something of a convention, convenient for the strong force but messy for the weak force. There is a slightly different basis for quark generations whose eigenstates don&#039;t quite match the mass eigenstates, and if we wrote quarks this way, then the weak interactions would conserve these alternative generations, but quarks would undergo spontaneous mixing like neutrinos.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Where did you read this?  I&#039;m having trouble finding sources that go into detail on this business of &quot;what&#039;s reality and what&#039;s just a conventional choice of basis&quot; when it comes to Yukawa interactions that give rise to fermion masses.]]></description>

OK, I see your point, but I don&amp;apos;t like your example!  That weak interaction doesn&amp;apos;t preserve flavour per se, but it preserves both fermion generation and electric charge, and the flavour of a quark or lepton (although not a baryon) is determined by its generation and charge.  Since the CKM matrix is so close to the identity and neutrinos are so hard to detect, generation is conserved to a good approximation, even in weak interactions.  So the real reason that flavour eigenstates (which, since charge is invariant, are the same as charge+generation eigenstates) need not match mass eigenstates are the exceptions: on the quark side, interactions like the one shown but with the down quark replaced with a strange (or bottom) quark; on the leptonic side, neutrino oscillation.

Incidentally, as I&amp;apos;ve been reading more about generation-mixing, I see that flavour eigenstates &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; the same as mass eigenstates for quarks, but this is something of a convention, convenient for the strong force but messy for the weak force.  There is a slightly different basis for quark generations whose eigenstates don&amp;apos;t quite match the mass eigenstates, and if we wrote quarks this way, then the weak interactions would conserve these alternative generations, but quarks would undergo spontaneous mixing like neutrinos.  Conversely, if we describe neutrinos using the mass eigenstates ν₁, ν₂, and ν₃, then there is no oscillation between these, but instead a W boson will sometimes (in fact quite often) mediate between an electron and a ν₂ or even a ν₃ neutrino instead of a ν₁ neutrino, just like it will sometimes mediate between an up quark and a strange quark or even a bottom quark instead of a down quark.  This seems like a better overall approach, in that there are fewer fundamental interactions (at the cost of making the weak interaction more complicated to describe).

There&amp;apos;s also the mystery of why flavour and mass eigenstates match exactly for the charged leptons if they don&amp;apos;t need to.  Except that it looks like this is also a matter of convention; there is yet another way of looking at things in which flavour and mass eigenstates match exactly for neutrinos, weak interactions still preserve generation, and charged leptons undergo oscillation now.  But of course nobody would want to use this basis, since it makes it complicated even to talk about electrons, the most commonly encountered fundamental fermion of them all!]]></description>
