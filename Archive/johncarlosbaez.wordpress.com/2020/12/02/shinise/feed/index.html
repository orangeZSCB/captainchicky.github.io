Neat.  So the University of Bologna is about 1000 years old!]]></description>

Well i think growth can have different meanings here. Other than increase profits, a company might decide to grow its profit margin, market (number of customers), market share, size (number of employees), capital investments, and so on.

It seems to me that long living companies (must) achieve just the right size in terms of market share so that they can stably occupy one (or more) niches. So if your niche is &quot;small&quot; then you can stay &quot;small&quot;, but if your market has a large size, you have to grow your market share to occupy a good portion of it. Which normally means growing in the other dimensions too.

This is an article with interesting reflections: https://medium.com/the-long-now-foundation/the-data-of-long-lived-institutions-4e7743c95f07]]></description>

Yeah, you&#039;d think that growing a business bigger would tend to make it more robust and able to survive downturns... but I guess this is just &lt;em&gt;part&lt;/em&gt; of an optimal strategy if your goal is to maximize the lifetime of a business.   Maximizing expected growth in the next 5 years (say) may involve taking risks that are likely to kill off your business before a hundred years go by.   And it could be that for a business to survive for a &lt;em&gt;thousand&lt;/em&gt; years, size plays a very small role.  Studying thousand-year-old businesses would be the best way to find out what works.  (But the next thousand years are going to be quite different than the last thousand.)

Interesting to hear about the pressure that was put on that bakery to grow.   It&#039;s pretty annoying!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a bit surprised that growing would not also be a life maximizing strategy as well?

In any case, I&#039;m very sympathetic to searching other metrics than growth in the capitalist sense. I personally know of bakery owners who &quot;made it big&quot; and told me that they didn&#039;t plan to. They wanted to stay a cozy bakery, but business growing suppliers told them they would supply to bigger bakeries unless they would not also extend their orders. So they would have gone out of business if they didn&#039;t go along with expanding. It&#039;s out of a Marxist textbook.]]></description>

Thanks!  I&#039;m interested in population biology and the general lessons we can learn from it, and I realize I need to catch up on new ideas regarding the r-K paradigm.  Clearly there&#039;s a lot more to life than the logistic equation!]]></description>

&quot;How Soy Sauce Has Been Made in Japan for Over 220 Years&quot;

The second article on shinise that I cited is mainly about how and why certain Japanese companies survive so long:

• Innan Sasaki, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/how-to-build-a-business-that-lasts-more-than-200-years-lessons-from-japans-shinise-companies-116839&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;How to build a business that lasts more than 200 years---lessons from Japan’s shinise companies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Conversation&lt;/i&gt;, 6 June 2019.

It&#039;s definitely deliberate: &quot;One of the reasons that shinise firms last so long is that they put a strong emphasis on longevity and tradition.&quot;  The article also says more about how they do it.  One method: becoming famous for having lasted a long time, and making &quot;old-fashioned&quot; things, helps you last longer.]]></description>

I wasn&#039;t trying to say anything profound there.  I wouldn&#039;t say it&#039;s a trivial tautology, just an observation that (apparently) no organisms other than humans deliberately try to maximize their species&#039; lifespan.   This makes the fact that some but not all have enormous lifespans all the more interesting: why does this happen just in the cases that it does?

(Of course you could argue organisms try to maximize their &lt;i&gt;individual&lt;/i&gt; lifespan, in the sense of &quot;trying to not die&quot;.  And these days &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamarckism#Mechanisms_resembling_Lamarckism&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;epigenetics is giving new life to Lamarckism&lt;/a&gt;.  But I&#039;m not going to argue that organisms are effectively trying to increase their species&#039; lifespan.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Japanese manufacturing culture is very interesting at many levels. There are still a few old men making bespoke knives in little shops. The baton was handed over from generation to generation.  I have a hand made kitchen knife  with my name stamped in it made by one such shop. The big knife manufacturers (eg from Germany) now account for most of the sales of high end knives. I recall a single Japanese machinist in a cluttered little shop who did precision machining for Airbus and possibly NASA. There is a video of him in his 80s doing the final cut on the lathe by ear! He could tell by the sound when it had reached its dimension. The Nissan GTR engines are hand assembled and the technician&#039;s name is put on a plate on the engine.]]></description>
