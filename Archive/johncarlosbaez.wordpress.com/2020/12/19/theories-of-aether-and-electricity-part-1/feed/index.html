I don&#039;t know of any practical application like that for amber.  So I guess magnetism took the lead for practical applications at first!

I&#039;d heard the lodestone compass was invented in China, but I see now that happened long ago:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  The compass was invented more than 2000 years ago. The first compasses were made of lodestone, a naturally magnetized stone of iron, in Han dynasty China (20 BC – 20 AD). The compass was later used for navigation during the Chinese Song Dynasty (960–1279 AD), as described by Shen Kuo. Later compasses were made of iron needles, magnetized by striking them with a lodestone. Magnetized needles and compasses were first described in medieval Europe by the English theologian Alexander Neckam (1157–1217 AD). Dry compasses begin appearing around 1300 in Medieval Europe and the Medieval Islamic world.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[When we think of Newton we think about his seminal work on dynamics and perhaps also optics, not necessarily E&#038;M but of course he was very curious about everything.  The author you mention (Edmund Whittaker) is also the author of the classic text &#039;A Treatise on the Analytical Dynamics of Particles and Rigid Bodies&#039; (I have the 2nd Ed., 1917...but unfortunately it&#039;s just a pdf!).]]></description>

Well, Franklin had a 50-50 chance of getting it &quot;right&quot;; in an antimatter universe, he would be right. I guess he&#039;s also right in P-type semiconductors. Of course Franklin wasn&#039;t talking about electrons, just the current.

Triboelectricity, like ferromagnetism and the friction force, belong to the &quot;messy&quot; branches of physics. As I understand it, real progress in the theory of these phenomena has occurred only in the last couple of decades.

Faraday apparently thought the electric current was a tension rather than a flow. (Or so I recall from L. Pearce William&#039;s bio.)]]></description>

Whoops!  Yes.  I deleted that bit because it&#039;s not the main point.  By the way, Benjamin Franklin is responsible for the unfortunate convention of calling the charge of an electron &#039;negative&#039;.  I&#039;m not sure why.  You can blame my slip on him.

Why do the electrons move to the amber instead of the other way around?  You can read a completely useless answer here:

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/299096/why-do-electrons-move-from-amber-to-wool-during-static-electricity-charging&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Why do electrons move from amber to wool during static electricity charging?&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Physics Stack Exchange&lt;/em&gt;.

and likewise here:

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/331363/what-happens-when-amber-is-rubbed-with-silk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;What happens when amber is rubbed with silk?&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Physics Stack Exchange&lt;/em&gt;.

where when the questioner persists, the answerer replies &quot;Your question is no longer related to physics but has more to do with organic chemistry still I&#039;ll answer it...&quot; before coughing up something slightly more useful.]]></description>
