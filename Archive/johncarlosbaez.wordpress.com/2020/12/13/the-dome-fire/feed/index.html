					<description><![CDATA[The following is not about coastal redwoods; it&#039;s about sequoias:

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/california-fire-killed-10-percent-redwood-trees-63c80e8d28e32596637f3ecc29cfe3c8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Study: California fire killed 10% of world’s giant sequoias&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Associated Press&lt;/i&gt;, 2 June 2021.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
SEQUOIA NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (AP) — At least a tenth of the world’s mature giant sequoia trees were destroyed by a single California wildfire that tore through the southern Sierra Nevada last year, according to a draft report prepared by scientists with the National Park Service.

The Visalia Times-Delta newspaper obtained a copy of the report that describes catastrophic destruction from the Castle Fire, which charred 273 square miles (707 square km) of timber in Sequoia National Park.

Researchers used satellite imagery and modeling from previous fires to determine that between 7,500 and 10,000 of the towering species perished in the fire. That equates to 10% to 14% of the world’s mature giant sequoia population, the newspaper said.

“I cannot overemphasize how mind-blowing this is for all of us. These trees have lived for thousands of years. They’ve survived dozens of wildfires already,” said Christy Brigham, chief of resources management and science at Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks.

The consequences of losing large numbers of giant sequoias could be felt for decades, forest managers said. Redwood and sequoia forests are among the world’s most efficient at removing and storing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The groves also provide critical habitat for native wildlife and help protect the watershed that supplies farms and communities on the San Joaquin Valley floor.

Brigham, the study’s lead author, cautioned that the numbers are preliminary and the research paper has yet to be peer reviewed. Beginning next week, teams of scientists will hike to the groves that experienced the most fire damage for the first time since the ashes settled.

“I have a vain hope that once we get out on the ground the situation won’t be as bad, but that’s hope — that’s not science,” she said.

The newspaper said the extent of the damage to one of the world’s most treasured trees is noteworthy because the sequoias themselves are incredibly well adapted to fire. The old-growth trees — some of which are more than 2,000 years old and 250 feet (76 meters) tall — require fire to burst their pine cones and reproduce.

“One-hundred years of fire suppression, combined with climate change-driven hotter droughts, have changed how fires burn in the southern Sierra and that change has been very bad for sequoia,” Brigham said.

Sequoia and Kings Canyon have conducted controlled burns since the 1960s, about a thousand acres a year on average. Brigham estimates that the park will need to burn around 30 times that number to get the forest back to a healthy state.

The Castle Fire erupted on Aug. 19 in the Golden Trout Wilderness amid a flurry of lightning strikes. The Shotgun Fire, a much smaller blaze burning nearby, was discovered shortly afterward, and the two were renamed the Sequoia Complex.

The silly part is that the article doesn&#039;t claim any coastal redwoods died---just the subhead says &quot;countless redwoods&quot; died.  It would be easy to fix by removing just a few words.

I&#039;m curious whether the subhead was read and approved by the author of the article, John Branch.  I&#039;ve found that in science magazines the headlines are often written by flunkies who value drama over accuracy.  Often the authors have no control over these headlines.  I despise this practice.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;&quot;The New York Times is claiming in a long, front-page story today that recent fires killed &quot;countless ancient redwoods&quot; in California

The claim is false and should be immediately corrected

There is no evidence that the fire killed even a single ancient redwood tree&quot;&lt;/i&gt;
 https://twitter.com/ShellenbergerMD/status/1337396120733982720

&lt;i&gt;The Redwood Trees Will Be Just Fine
Less spectacular elements of the forest need our concern.

But redwoods are well adapted to handle fire, as the fact that they have stuck around might suggest. A number of ecologists have since clarified that most of the redwoods in the park, although charred, will likely survive. “Fire is a natural part of the redwood ecosystem,” says Anthony Ambrose, a forest ecologist and redwood expert.&lt;/i&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve only seen Joshua trees a few  times

(i hitchiked and jumped trains from texas to arizona--you could see them from the train or road or if you had a stop just walk around the desert) and i also saw them in Mexico where i went a few times.In the desert you see scorpions, lizards , rattlesnakes, road runner birds and more.  Very nice and interesting but i belong in the desert as much as i belong in the sea--also interesting to see. My areas are &#039;midatlantic from piedmont to appalachans--which are somewhat like Santa Cruz mtns though also different. In appalchianstyou can go from semi- arctic type areas to desert type areas in a 4 mile (very steep) walk.

Obviously i&#039;m pessimistic about the fate of the Joshua trees (and even coastal redwoods--or the east coast version  called Eastern Hemlock.  However, these are hardy trees. I&#039;ve seen entire areas of old growth  or virgin eastern hemlock forests wiped out or die off but some do persist  and i also have seen a few places whiich i thought were wiped out with new small ones coming back.   If they had less stress they possibly could come back---by themselves. You can&#039;t build roads, houses, or log in  these areas  or it will just be a desert.  I guess you can see forests on TV--maybe thats preferable. Some areas pay people to restore ecosystems at the same time they are destroying the ecosystem 100 feet away.)

I couldn&#039;t believe it when i heard there were fires in the coastal redwoods a few months agfo --i guess its true (i just looked it up) . Those areas in my experience were cool, humid , moist, with lots of small creeks---some with trout in them. My view was these never have fires except from lighteining strikes. But i guess drought gets them too.

(I view eastern hemlocks as the  miniature equivalent of coastal redwoods but in the east they look big (get up to 150 feet) , and live in same &#039;cool moist habitats&#039; and are also in many cases dying off--combination of global warming and invasive pests.

If you get a snowy winter that keeps the pests down. If you don&#039;t, or people decide to log the hemlock forest and maybe build houses, you end up with a hot semi-desert--and the   trout stream  and springs are gone.  along with all the frogs and salamanders. Mosquitos and ticks are back--and there&#039;s nowhere to sit anymore--so you need to buy an air conidtioner and stay inside.

(A lot of westerners say  the east has no mountains---they call the applachians &#039;hills&#039; (a few get over 6000 feet  ) but in the west they say to be a mountain it has to be 14000 feet.  (In India  and Tibet 13000 feet is the valley  ; mountains only occur above 22000 feet).

According to some westerners,  a tree has to be 400 feet so eastern hemlocks at 100 feet are  shrubs or ornamental plants or weeds.    The closest hemlock tree to here i know of  i&#039;ve seen for 10 years and is &#039;out of its range&#039;---its a &#039;singularity&#039; (in the past there were trout here, and probably more hemlocks, but not now)--and its growing rapidly--lives on a rock next to a creek and may  have grown 1 inch in 10 years.it seems to be getting fatter but not much taller.Maybe like Einstein who hysaid was a slow learner and talker its a sslow growther

The closest mountain to here is 1200 feet, which is the same elevation as where i used to stay in the valley where the highest moutain is 3300 feet, and you go over a few mountains you can get to valleys which are at 3000 feet with mountans at 4800 feet.

There are Joshua trees in Mexico--likely under threat as well--had fun times there and it was fairly cheap (i&#039;d go for 3 months and last time i did luxury class --200$ -- tho that didnt last long--thanks to some people they  releived me of carrying 180$  of it about 2nd day but i had 20$ hidden so i had to go back to economy class  (i can sort of handle thsi--my trip to India for 3 months  was done with 2$ in cash up front and then you do husiness....(eg sell your used camera and kewp going).

I mostly hiked through as much of it as i could--i stayed away from cities, and once met some sort of big cat (not a mountain lion--had a lot of spots on it like an ocelot which are smaller like a bobcat and more common---possibly one of the rare jaguars . It was on a mountain trail and  scared me so much i  decided to give it &#039;right of way and stepped off the trail and slipped down a small cliff --sort of got caught  in tree halfway down. I had a similar experience in Alaska with a Grizzly bear--met it on a trail on a mountaintop    (but it was a &#039;baby bear &#039; maybe only 500 pounds---so i ran it off--played it a little song on my guitar i was carrying. i&#039;ve found thats enough to run almost anyone or anything off. it didn&#039;t work for the jaguar--guitar went down the cliff with me. i had told some locals i&#039;d give them the guitar --(cash) poor &#039;indigenous people&#039; who treated me wit a visit to their &#039;home&#039; (in mexico you dont need a big house but you have a nice home--fruit trees (special indigeneous kinds which grow nowhere else and are a  delicacy ) .

I dont think i&#039;d go back to mexico now --even mountain areas i went through have been taken over by cartels i heard.

I think it&#039;s possible Joshua trees have a chance but they may  go extinct  due to climate change and development--turning Nevada and Arizona and SoCal into casinos ,  golf courses and &#039;conference nd event centers&#039;--i&#039;m &#039;amazed&#039; at how many scientific/secular humanist/rationalist type groups hold their conferences in Las Vegas

A lot of the &#039;scientific rationalist&#039; groups consider  gambling &#039;irrational&#039; and some even worry about climate change including things like depleting the Colorado aquifier but they want people to fly to their conference and spend 400$/day so they have a water fountain at their conference with prominent biologists, physcists, philosophers, etc. in a las vegas casino.

I wonder if any f the sceintists/skeptics/humanists&#039;/rationalists who go to the coference go  see the Joshua trees around there during break time, or just go to the casino and meet someone new...]]></description>

    “In a relative instant, countless ancient redwoods, hundreds of giant sequoias and more than one million Joshua trees perished.”
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  
  “Countless ancient redwoods” did not perish.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That&#039;s a subtitle.  The article doesn&#039;t talk about any coastal redwoods dying in fires, though it talks about a big fire.  The subtitle  is indeed wrong.  It may be a clumsy attempt to refer to this part of the article:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  The extinction of redwoods is hard to imagine, with a cool, soggy range still measured in the millions of acres. The fear is for the relatively few remaining old-growth trees.
  
  An estimated 95 percent of them were chopped down, mostly to fuel California’s building booms in the late 1800s and early 1900s.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I hope Joshua trees grow back to replace the million that burnt!  They take 60 years to reach maturity, so I won&#039;t see it.  Global warming will be much further along then, so their optimal habitat will have moved north.  Maybe someone can help them.]]></description>

&quot;In a relative instant, countless ancient redwoods, hundreds of giant sequoias and more than one million Joshua trees perished.&quot;

&quot;Countless ancient redwoods&quot; did not perish.

Further, on Joshua Trees, It is not unusual for them to be burned in fires, and they do recover although not well studied.

&lt;i&gt;Leary [58] suggests 3 reasons that fires were historically rarer in southwestern deserts than in other ecosystems. Vegetation spacing in the deserts did not promote fire spread. Litter and fuel levels were low in the deserts, and lastly, deserts were sparsely populated and had a reduced chance of human-caused fires. However, invasive species have changed the fuel and litter loads (see Changes in fire frequency and size with nonnatives), and human-caused fires have become more common ... &lt;/i&gt;

And Joshua tree seeds may be more likely to germinate after exposure to high temperatures possibly related to fire.

&lt;i&gt;Short durations of hot temperatures may increase Joshua tree germination. Germination percentages of seed, collected from several Joshua tree populations in the Mojave Desert and subjected to heat treatments, are provided below. Germination percentages for seed kept at 190 °F (90°C) for 5 minutes were significantly higher (p&#060;0.01) than seed under control conditions&lt;/i&gt;

So like many things in the natural world, it&#039;s complicated.]]></description>

I&#039;m glad that most of them survived!

What did the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; article say about coastal redwoods that&#039;s wrong?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot; ... along with the ancient coastal redwoods and giant sequouias that we also lost this year.&quot;

I don&#039;t know about the Joshua trees, but the NYT has it completely wrong about the redwoods.

&lt;blockquote&gt;BOULDER CREEK, Calif. - When a massive wildfire swept through California’s oldest state park last week it was feared many trees in a grove of old-growth redwoods, some of them 2,000 years old and among the tallest living things on Earth, may finally have succumbed.

But an Associated Press reporter and photographer hiked the renowned Redwood Trail at Big Basin Redwoods State Park on Monday and confirmed most of the ancient redwoods had withstood the blaze. Among the survivors is one dubbed Mother of the Forest.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
