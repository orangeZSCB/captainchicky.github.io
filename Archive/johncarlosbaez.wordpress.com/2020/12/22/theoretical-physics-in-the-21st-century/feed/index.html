It&#039;s really exciting to hear that there exists all this rich theoretical activity in condensed matter physics!]]></description>

I don&#039;t feel that way at all!  I work on applied category theory, which is building up a unified approach to networks of many kinds: chemical reaction networks, electrical circuits, and much more.  But if someone prefers traditional physics, condensed matter physics is incredibly exciting these days.  It&#039;s using almost all the wonderful techniques of quantum field theory that particle physics does, but with the advantage that you can test your theories on a small tabletop!  It&#039;s moving much faster than high-energy particle physics, and it&#039;s full of revolutionary new ideas.  I feel I have a duty to point young physicists toward condensed matter physics, where they have a much better chance of making important discoveries than if they do high-energy particle physics.]]></description>

I can understand that, but it does make me a bit sad. It feels like everything else either goes in the direction of engineering or in the direction of pure math, with no need to correspond to physical reality at all.]]></description>

If I thought my advice could completely shut down the field, I&#039;d say &lt;em&gt;&quot;almost all physicists should turn elsewhere---but please, a few of you keep working on particle physics.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;   However, I don&#039;t think I need to say that: no matter what I say, some physicists will keep working on particle physics.  If I persuade a few hundred young physicists to turn from particle physics to something more productive and exciting, I&#039;ll count that as a huge success.]]></description>

  I’ll argue that physicists should turn elsewhere!
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wow, that seems like a pretty radical statement. Is not particle physics doomed to die if there is not continued work in the field?]]></description>
