Lumping fusion in with nuclear power might be part of the problem.  Many non-physicists don’t understand the differences between fission and fusion in general, and the environmental impact in particular.  There have been several major catastrophes with fission.  As long as the fusion advocates continue to advocate fission as well, it is no wonder that the message doesn’t get through.]]></description>

Thanks, I&#039;ll read that!

Where are all the lobbyists pushing for research in fusion?  Alas, older people are more likely to vote, at least in the US, and they have lots of practical reasons for caring about cancer, heart disease etc... and fewer reasons to care about long-term health of the planet, and projects like nuclear fusion.   Environmentalists are pretty good at lobbying, but most of them haven&#039;t accepted the importance of nuclear power either.]]></description>

Some useful background on the travails of the U.S. effort to make fusion energy generation possible, especially the travails of the Princeton Plasma Physics Lab, is here:

Glaring is the paucity of government support for this exceedingly worthwhile endeavor.
Especially as compared to its funding for NIH.]]></description>

Two possibilities:
1. The govt has separate accounts for
&quot;Supporting scientific research&quot; and
&quot;Fighting climate change/global warming&quot;.
2. Funding for next year is flat, but then it increases dramatically.

The flat/jump scenario seems implausible to me.
The other scenario is possible.

I agree, this needs clarification.]]></description>

I don&#039;t know how to reconcile the figures.  I guess I trust &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt; more than &lt;i&gt;GreenTech Media&lt;/i&gt; for these numbers, but it&#039;s also possible &lt;i&gt;GreenTech&lt;/i&gt; was talking about an earlier draft of the bill, or maybe there&#039;s a difference between &quot;basic and applied research into nuclear fusion&quot; and &quot;fusion energy sciences&quot;, or maybe they just counted different items as fitting into these categories.  Someone should figure it out!]]></description>

Maybe I&#039;m misreading things, but &quot;Science Magazine&quot; seems to have a different take on funding for fusion research.

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/12/massive-2021-us-spending-bill-leaves-research-advocates-hoping-more&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Massive 2021 U.S. spending bill leaves research advocates hoping for more&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt;, 22 December 2020.

&quot;Fusion energy sciences and high-energy physics get only $1 million more than they received this year, some $671 million and $1.046 billion, respectively...&quot;

I&#039;m not sure how to reconcile that with the more rosy-eyed figures.   If that $4.7G is spread over 5 years, we have $4.7G/5yrs ~ $940M/year.   Different budget items?]]></description>

I looked around, and it seems &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Protocol#Chlorofluorocarbons_(CFCs)_Phase-out_Management_Plan&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;chlorofluorocarbons&lt;/a&gt; (CFCs) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Protocol#Hydrochlorofluorocarbons_(HCFCs)_Phase-out_Management_Plan_(HPMP)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;hydrochlorofluorocarbons&lt;/a&gt; (HCFCs) are being phased out under the Montreal Protocol.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Protocol#Hydrofluorocarbons_(HFCs)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Hydrofluorocarbons&lt;/a&gt; (HFCs) were dealt with later: they were covered by the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, which came into force in 2019.

However, Trump did not sign on to the Kigali Amendment, even though Republicans in Congress supported it:

&#8226; Phil McKenna, &lt;a href=&quot;https://insideclimatenews.org/news/12022019/kigali-amendment-trump-ratify-hfcs-short-lived-climate-pollutant-republican-business-support-montreal-protocol/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;What’s keeping Trump from ratifying a climate treaty even Republicans support?&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Inside Climate News&lt;/i&gt;, 12 February 2019.

Of course the question almost answers itself.

So, maybe the new bill does something similar to what signing the Kigali Accord would do.  I&#039;m not sure.

According to the &lt;i&gt;Washington Post&lt;/i&gt; article, nuclear power is getting $11 billion in funding from the new bill.   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/solar-and-wind-tax-credit-extensions-energy-rd-package-in-spending-bill-before-congress&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;GreenTech Media&lt;/a&gt; writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Nuclear power will receive $6.6 billion for modernizing nuclear power plants and develop &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/terrapower-x-energy-win-160m-in-doe-grants-to-build-advanced-nuclear-plants-by-2027&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;advanced reactor designs&lt;/a&gt;, and $4.7 billion will be used to fund basic and applied research into nuclear fusion.
