I realize this is stretching the definition of &quot;mathematical proof,&quot; but by way of comparison, the largest chess endgame tablebase (which records the optimal-play outcome of each reachable chess position having 7 or fewer pieces on the board) is a miniscule 140 TB.  Research is ongoing on an 8-piece tablebase, which is expected to exceed 1 petabyte in size.]]></description>

Nice!  Thanks, Royce.  There was a typo in formula which made it not compile; I hope I added parentheses in the right places.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2020/04/14/bigness-part-3/#comment-160839&quot;&gt;Wolfgang&lt;/a&gt;.

The proof I&#039;m discussing here was far more clever than an exhaustive search.  An exhaustive search would have taken vastly longer, and would be completely impractical.   This is already visible from the fact that they proved there are

12,418,001,077,381,302,684

semigroups of size 10 by listing just

718,981,858,383,872

of them.   The rest --- 99.994% of them --- were dealt with in a more clever way.   But even listing the ones they did would have been impractical without some serious mathematical tricks.

By the way: there never was a limit on the size of proofs.  Since there are infinitely many theorems (in most formalizations of mathematics), and only finitely many of size &#060; N for any number N (in any specific system), there have to be infinitely many of size &#062; N.

In particular, I know a theorem whose shortest proof (in your favorite consistent formalization of set theory) is so long that the number of digits in the number of digits in the number of digits in the number of steps in its shortest proof exceeds the number of atoms in the observable Universe.   I explain how to find such a theorem here:

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/10/19/insanely-long-proofs/&quot;&gt;Insanely long proofs&lt;/a&gt;.

But the question I&#039;m interested in &lt;i&gt;right now&lt;/i&gt; is: what&#039;s the longest proof that someone has actually &lt;i&gt;done&lt;/i&gt;?  If anyone knows one longer than 60 exabytes, please let me know!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Isn&#039;t it a bit odd to count an exhaustive search as a proof? Technically, I guess, it is one, of course. But then this just means, that there will be no limit to the size of a proof anymore. There are possibly an infinite amount of especially combinatorial enumeration problems which go on forever, each contributing an infinite sized proof.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In the book &quot;Enumeration of Finite Groups&quot;, a simple argument is given which proves that the number of semigroups of order n is eventually greater than $latex n^{n^2 (1 - \epsilon)} $, so it&#039;s quite close to the number $latex n^{n^2} $ of binary operations.  A more sophisticated argument gives a lower bound of $latex n^{n^2 (1 - (\log \log n / \log n))} - O (1/ \log n) $.]]></description>
