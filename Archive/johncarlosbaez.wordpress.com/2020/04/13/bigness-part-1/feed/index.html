I think enough mathematicians are doing proofs with computers now---and there&#039;s enough buzz about this---that few practicing mathematicians still think it&#039;s necessary for formal proofs to be extremely long.   At least few who read blogs, Twitter, and the like.  But there probably was an era when this was widely believed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think the &quot;classical&quot; lack of attention to formulating formal systems which permit practical-length formal definitions and proofs has had a very unfortunate real-world consequence: people who want to pursue projects such as CoQ, allowing automatic checking of actual formal proofs as a hopefully-someday-practical tool, have had to overcome an incorrect but strong impression that it&#039;s &lt;em&gt;inherently necessary&lt;/em&gt; for interesting formal proofs to be impractically long.

Probably a big reason for that was that automatic computers were not a well-known concept predicted to soon be practical, at the time these formal systems were first devised. Unfortunately, once that changed, it remained a rare realization that formal systems could be adapted to address that problem. Perhaps it still is (in spite of it having been mostly demonstrated to be possible) -- I&#039;m not sure.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Functional Role of Structures in Bourbaki by Gerhard Heinzmann and Jean Petitot

This chapter and the book &quot;The Prehistory of Mathematical Structuralism&quot; (Erich Reck, Georg Schiemer, eds),
have been published by Oxford University Press. 
PDF IS IN OPEN ACCESS:
https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-prehistory-of-mathematical-structuralism-9780190641221?cc=fr&#038;lang=en&#038;

Description:
Recently, debates about mathematical structuralism have picked up steam again within the philosophy of mathematics, probing ontological and epistemological issues in novel ways. These debates build on discussions of structuralism which began in the 1960s in the work of philosophers such as Paul Benacerraf and Hilary Putnam; going further than these previous thinkers, however, these new debates also recognize that the motivation for structuralist views should be tied to methodological developments within mathematics. In fact, practically all relevant ideas and methods have roots in the structuralist transformation that modern mathematics underwent in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

This edited volume of new essays by top scholars in the philosophy of mathematics explores this previously overlooked &#039;pre-history&#039; of mathematical structuralism. The contributors explore this historical background along two distinct but interconnected dimensions. First, they reconsider the methodological contributions of major figures in the history of mathematics, such as Dedekind, Hilbert, and Bourbaki, who are responsible for the introduction of new number systems, algebras, and geometries that transformed the landscape of mathematics. Second, they reexamine a range of philosophical reflections by mathematically inclined philosophers, like Russell, Cassirer, and Quine, whose work led to profound conclusions about logical, epistemological, and metaphysical aspects of structuralism.

Overall, the essays in this volume show not only that the pre-history of mathematical structuralism is much richer than commonly appreciated, but also that it is crucial to take into account this broader intellectual history for enriching current debates in the philosophy of mathematics. The insights included in this volume will interest scholars and students in the philosophy of mathematics, the philosophy of science, and the history of philosophy.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2020/04/13/bigness-part-1/#comment-160871&quot;&gt;John Baez&lt;/a&gt;.

That was fun to do (I remember a few years ago finding Mathias&#039;s paper and thinking about implementing a theorem prover based on Bourbaki&#039;s formal system; thankfully I didn&#039;t, it would have been horribly slow). I have two or three quick comments to make.

First, after reading Jose Grimm&#039;s second paper on Bourbaki (as prompted by comments by Timothy Chang), Grimm aroused my suspicion that Bourbaki&#039;s definition of cardinality may be different than the symbols used in the footnotes. Bourbaki defines cardinality as

$latex Card(x)=\tau_{z}Eq(x,z)$

where &quot;Eq(x,z)&quot; is the relation &quot;There exists a bijection from x to z&quot;. The symbols used in the footnote is not an &quot;on the nose translation&quot; of this. This would mean the length of &quot;2&quot; is even &lt;b&gt;bigger&lt;/b&gt; than I thought.

Second, consequently, there is &quot;wiggle room&quot; for writing equivalent definitions in Bourbaki&#039;s system which expands to a different number of symbols. The unordered pair is defined as

$latex \{a, b\} = \tau_{z}\forall y((y\in z)\iff(y=a\lor y=b)),$

which is fine. The singleton could be defined analogously as

$latex \{a\} = \tau_{z}\forall y((y\in z)\iff(y=a))$

or using the unordered pair

$latex \{a\} = \{a,a\}.$

Using the unordered pair requires more symbols, but it&#039;s a syntactic redundancy, namely writing $latex y=a\lor y=a$ instead of just $latex y=a$ once. There are many other places where similar variations could be made. These variations differ by just a few symbols each, but they add up. Consequently, when reporting lengths, they should be viewed as &quot;order of magnitude estimates&quot; rather than &quot;written in stone&quot;.  

Third, I realize my simplifications to reduce the size of &quot;1&quot; was inadequate. Basically, recall that Bourbaki writes &quot;(B &#124; x) A&quot; for &quot;replace every instance of &#039;x&#039; with &#039;B&#039; in &#039;A&#039;&quot;. I did the following: first remove all double negations in B and call this result B&#039;, then remove all double negations in A and call this result A&#039;, then replace every instance of x in A&#039; with B&#039;. BUT consider $latex (\neg y &#124; x) \neg x$. My simplification looks at the recipient of the substitution $latex \neg x$, realizes it is as simple as possible,  then looks at the substitutee $latex \neg y$, realizes it is as simple as possible, then makes the substitution yielding $latex \neg \neg y$. There&#039;s a residual double negation! If we then run the result through a &quot;remove double negation&quot; simplifier again, then we get the simpler result &quot;y&quot;. This is just a toy model of the generic problem, of course.

Consequently, when I look at the various sizes of constants and relations, they drastically reduce in size. (By which I mean, whereas it would take an asaṃkhyeya-kalpa to read the original version, now in its simplified form it&#039;s just the lifetime of the universe!) Specifically, &quot;1&quot; has length 155,057,161 and &quot;2&quot; has length 2,091,643,417.

There is a caveat here, because of how I wrote my code, performing these simplifications is quite computationally intense! The computer I ran this on had 32 GB of RAM and a very respectable processor, and it couldn&#039;t finish simplifying the relation &quot;1+1=2&quot; before it crashed. I may rewrite my code this weekend to try to avoid this, so as to give the length of &quot;1+1=2&quot; in its simplest form.]]></description>

My simplification looks at the recipient of the substitution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cneg+x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;neg x" class="latex" />, realizes it is as simple as possible,  then looks at the substitutee <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cneg+y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;neg y" class="latex" />, realizes it is as simple as possible, then makes the substitution yielding <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cneg+%5Cneg+y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;neg &#92;neg y" class="latex" />. There&#8217;s a residual double negation! If we then run the result through a &#8220;remove double negation&#8221; simplifier again, then we get the simpler result &#8220;y&#8221;. This is just a toy model of the generic problem, of course.</p>
<p>Consequently, when I look at the various sizes of constants and relations, they drastically reduce in size. (By which I mean, whereas it would take an asaṃkhyeya-kalpa to read the original version, now in its simplified form it&#8217;s just the lifetime of the universe!) Specifically, &#8220;1&#8221; has length 155,057,161 and &#8220;2&#8221; has length 2,091,643,417.</p>
<p>There is a caveat here, because of how I wrote my code, performing these simplifications is quite computationally intense! The computer I ran this on had 32 GB of RAM and a very respectable processor, and it couldn&#8217;t finish simplifying the relation &#8220;1+1=2&#8221; before it crashed. I may rewrite my code this weekend to try to avoid this, so as to give the length of &#8220;1+1=2&#8221; in its simplest form.</p>

Of course, other foundations can be used and can replace Bourbaki&#039;s set theory in their books, and this is probably one of the reasons which explains why they didn&#039;t spend too much time on fine-tuning that part. Actually, omitting ordinals (which are only covered in exercises) is in my opinion a much bigger drawback than using some inefficient coding device, or using a global choice primitive (the latter is part, I think, of the same philosophy from which it follows that there is &lt;em&gt;no question&lt;/em&gt; about what the real numbers are in Bourbaki...)

But note that any time Bourbaki uses Zorn&#039;s Lemma, they quote the corresponding result from &quot;Ensembles&quot; (where it is actually stated in the form of a fun variant of what is commonly used, which succeeds in &quot;factoring out&quot; a lot of the boilerplate arguments found in many other texts to show that the ordering used is inductive). Except for basic arguments with cardinals, this is more or less the only set theoretic thing that can be needed later for the kind of mathematics that they do (namely, to prove the Stokes formula...).]]></description>
