Speaking for everyone---thanks!  I&#039;ve been too busy running online seminars to go to many, but the great thing about having them recorded on YouTube is that they are available whenever one has time (though the live experience is nicer, since you can ask questions or at least dream of doing so).]]></description>

That&#039;s a really good point that I haven&#039;t paid attention to when sharing my slides. I will have to take that extra step in the future. Thanks!

Also, I&#039;d like to leave a note of general appreciation for John and everyone else involved in making these seminars happen. I&#039;ve dropped in twice now even though the topics have been at most adjacent to anything I officially work on. Partly, this was to keep my intellectual curiosity going, and partly it was to see how online seminars can work in practice as the community gets the bugs out of the process, since I hope to run one of my own not too long from now. They have been helpful on both counts.]]></description>
