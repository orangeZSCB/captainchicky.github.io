There&#039;s something true about this.  But these folks are going to give someone a $1,000,000 prize.   Lots of people are making lots of useful discoveries, inventing things, organizing people and doing other good work.    Which one should win the prize?  That&#039;s what I&#039;m asking.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This really is more about changing individual choices and values. It’s very simple. No great mind or scientist will change it. Also a lot of people overlook it’s not just about fossil fuels. It’s about over consumption of just about everything and being disconnected from nature.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I have been a long time reader of Azimuth and This Week’s Finds. You asked for potential candidates for a sustainability prize. Here are some ideas in a few different categories. I tried to pick people who have had important scientific and engineering achievements, but in some cases are less well known than they should be.

Studies of energy technology and transitions

&#8226;  Jessika Trancik (Prof. of Energy Systems, MIT; http://trancik.mit.edu)
&#8226;  Vaclav Smil (Prof. of Environmental Sciences (Emeritus), U. of Manitoba; http://vaclavsmil.com)
&#8226;  Arnulf Grubler (Research Scholar at IIASA and Prof. of Environmental Studies at Yale (Emeritus); https://iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/researchPrograms/TransitionstoNewTechnologies/Arnulf-Gruebler.en.html)

If the award committee is looking to help boost a talented and accomplished mid-career person, then Trancik is the better choice. If it is more of a lifetime achievement award, Smil and Grubler fit the bill (though both may still be publishing).

Renewable electricity

&#8226; Chris Eberspacher (Tandem PV, SunFab (Applied Materials), ARCO Solar, Unisun; https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-eberspacher-2552644)
&#8226;  Dick Swanson (SunPower, Stanford; https://us.sunpower.com/blog/2016/10/06/history-sunpower-solar-energy-innovation)
&#8226; Jeff Koplow (Sandia National Lab; https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeff-koplow-1b7a511b)

They may also want to check out the organization Activate, which trains academic scientists and engineers to make useful products from their discoveries, many in energy and environmental fields. (I participated in their program and vouch in general for the support and training provided. I am an alumnus and would not directly benefit if they were awarded this prize.)

https://www.activate.org

Hope this helps and good luck.

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2020/04/07/the-best-work-on-sustainability/#comment-160667&quot;&gt;nad&lt;/a&gt;.

nad--maybe Elon Musk  could use the Berlin water supply to fuel the self driving cars. then you just have your car drive to store and buy bottled water in plastic bottles. in my region (including &#039;Appalachia&#039; in eastern USA ) some companies have privatized the (spring) water.   it comes from the rain and snow in the (small) mountains. (some of my western aquaintances call them hills .  i&#039;ve been one time to himalayas, and also to alps , and other places in alaska and  mexico .  i view all these mountains as similar.  except no glaciers in appalachians. it can still go down to -34F but due to global warming perhaps that may not occur much anymore. )

my area has bike trails, a big park,  and public transit---and its free now due to COVID, ( the small parks are closed).   some people use these but some don&#039;t---  they&#039;d rather get in their car and go to McDonald&#039;s diive thru or a liquor store---this is considered an essential service .

my mother spent an insane amount of time dealing with law studies when an MIT economist who moved next door decided to use the rorf of the house i grew up in as part of his house--he had a bar and a suntan deck on his roof and wanted to use part of my parents house for that.  he won the case.  but he did remove his stairway to my roof.  (in the past my neighborhood and that house were not considered desirable areas ---the housesitters there who were sort of my friends but older-- turned out to be heroin addicts who did burglary of upscale stores for their  night job.  i was surprised when i saw how much &#039;loot&#039; they had in that house--police carried it out.  i was asleep the whole time.  there were screech owls in the hemlock trees in front of my window.)]]></description>

One could look up Mark Z Jacobson of Stanford U ---i imagine you know of him.  I think maybe &#039;battery storage&#039; for solar energy power is a priority.   If someone can invent that maybe they deserve a prze.  (i can&#039;t do that).

https://web.stanford.edu/group/emfh/jacobson

he has &#039;controversial papers&#039; in PNAS.

Prizes probably are ok or good for some people (&#039;mathematical olympiads&#039;  inspiired many good math people, but i was never a contest person  including sports.   i deliberately lost and also deliberately flunked my tests .)

a &#039;prize&#039; assigns a &#039;value&#039; to some activity. did einstein&#039;s or Ramanujan&#039;s mom get a prize?]]></description>

Prashanta, as far as I understood water.org is acting globally, not just in specific countries:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We are here to bring safe water and sanitation to the world through access to small, affordable loans.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I am not sure whether loans are always the right choice for helping. Plus- as I described in the comment above -it is also important not just to bring but also to &lt;em&gt;preserve&lt;/em&gt; safe water and sanitation. The planned Tesla Gigafactory for Berlin/Grünheide, Germany is a massive threat to Berlins drinking water. In particular the politicians here do not seem to look onto the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ufz.de/index.php?de=37937&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;drought monitor.&lt;/a&gt; So thanks for pointing out water.org but I would anyways doubt that Matt Damon&#039;s loans could change Musk&#039;s plans.]]></description>
