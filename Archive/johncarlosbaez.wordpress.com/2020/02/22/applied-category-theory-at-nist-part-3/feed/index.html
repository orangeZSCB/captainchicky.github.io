					<description><![CDATA[John
As I have previously confessed, I am not even a Neanderthal when it comes to the detail, but at a high level I think this type of structural or schematic application of CT in a real commercial setting is actually a major triumph. I am pleased to see that Blake et al have got interesting and important work based on CT. I walked out of Ross Street&#039;s advanced algebra course (a thinly veiled front for CT) for Fourier theory....such is life. It was the 70s.
Cheers
