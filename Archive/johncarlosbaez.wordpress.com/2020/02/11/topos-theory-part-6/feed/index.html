					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2020/02/11/topos-theory-part-6/#comment-158835&quot;&gt;Keith Harbaugh&lt;/a&gt;.

You can use different styles of arrows; for example, you wrote $latex \rightarrow$, while John wrote $latex \Rightarrow$.  You can also tell by context; if there&amp;apos;s a colon before $latex X \to Y$, then this means that the symbol in front of the colon is a morphism from $latex X$ to $latex Y$, while otherwise $latex X \to Y$ is the internal hom object.  Or you can embrace the ambiguity, and say that $latex f \colon A$ is allowed for &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; object $latex A$ and means that $latex f$ is an element of $latex A$.

This last option conflates a morphism with its name, so that kicks the ambiguity down the road.  You could resolve this by having different notation for a morphism generally than for a morphism thought of as an element.  For example, if you normally write composition as $latex g \circ f$, then you can write it as $latex g ( f )$ instead when $latex f$ is being thought of as an element.  Then if you have $latex f \colon X \to Y$ and later write $latex g \circ f$, then $latex g$ must be a morphism with domain $latex Y$ and this is ordinary composition; while if you write $latex g ( f )$, then $latex g$ must be a morphism with domain $latex X \to Y$ and this is really the composite of $latex g$ with the name $latex \tilde f$ of $latex f$.

This may seem more trouble than it&amp;apos;s worth, but it&amp;apos;s actually extremely common!  In ordinary mathematics, we often fail to distinguish between an object $latex A$ of a closed category and the underlying set of $latex A$ (the set of elements of $latex A$, or the hom-set from $latex 1$ to $latex A$).  And more generally, we don&amp;apos;t distinguish between an internal hom-set and an external hom-set.  This means that $latex \mathrm {hom} ( X , Y )$ is conflated with $latex [ X , Y ]$, which is conflated with $latex \mathrm { hom } ( 1 , [ X , Y ] )$; all of these are called the object of morphisms from $latex X$ to $latex Y$ (say, the vector space of linear transformations from $latex X$ to $latex Y$, to be concrete).  So the complicated notation of the previous paragraph recreates ordinary mathematical practice.]]></description>

To both John and Toby:
How do people using the arrow notation for the internal hom distinguish that from 
a specific arrow between the designated pair of objects,
i.e., an element of the external hom?
The lack of a label, e.g., $latex f:X \to Y$ for a specific, named, arrow versus the same without the label?
In general, I find Kelly&#039;s treatment of all this in Chapter 1 of &lt;a href=&quot;http://tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/10/tr10abs.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;BCECT&lt;/a&gt; the best approach for me.]]></description>

The arrow notation is good for any closed category; it emphasizes that $latex X \to Y$ consists of maps from $latex X$ to $latex Y$.  Although it might be good to &lt;em&gt;decorate&lt;/em&gt; the arrow whenever the closed category is non-cartesian.  For example, in a category of vector spaces, $latex X \to Y$ consists of the &lt;em&gt;linear&lt;/em&gt; transformations from $latex X$ to $latex Y$, so maybe the notation should reflect that.]]></description>

In my post I&#039;m sticking tightly to Mac Lane and Moerdijk&#039;s notation and not discussing anything else.  But it&#039;s great to talk about stuff in comments!

Another notation for exponentials in the cartesian closed case is

$latex X \Rightarrow Y$

(perhaps with some other kind of arrow) to mean the object of maps from $latex X$ to $latex Y$.   This seems to be especially popular in computer science.  It&#039;s good when you have exponentials of exponentials of exponentials... so the notation doesn&#039;t climb up the page.  It&#039;s also nice how it avoids the &#039;backwards&#039; quality of using $latex Y^X$ to mean the object of maps from $latex X$ to $latex Y.$]]></description>

I would agree with using $latex [X, Y]$ for general closed monoidal categories. But I&#039;d say $latex Y^X$ captures the right intuitions to have for &lt;em&gt;cartesian&lt;/em&gt; closed categories. Indeed, the canonical isomorphisms $latex (Y \times Z)^X \cong Y^X \times Z^X$ and $latex Z^{X + Y} \cong Z^X \times Z^Y$ (in cases where coproducts exist) and $latex Z^{Y \times X} \cong (Z^Y)^X$ are the correct categorifications of the familiar exponential laws.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know you&#039;re trying to keep this streamlined, but even so would it not be a good idea to observe, somewhere in the document, that it is common, notably in Max Kelly&#039;s work on enriched cat theory, to denote the internal hom with square brackets, e.g. $latex [X,Y]$, rather than using the exponential notation ? (Hope I got that latex right :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for explaining the &quot;currying&quot; operation so clearly.
