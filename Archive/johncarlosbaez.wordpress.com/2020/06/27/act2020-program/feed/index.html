Bose and Einstein realized photons were bosons by 1924 and we had lasers by 1960, so it went pretty quick.

As for applied category theory, you might listen to some of these 8-minute talks at ACT2020 by people working at companies that use category theory:

•  Arquimedes Canedo (Siemens Corporate Technology).

• Brendan Fong (Topos Institute).

• Jelle Herold (Statebox): Industrial strength CT.

• Steve Huntsman (BAE): Inhabiting the value proposition for category theory.

• Ilyas Khan (Cambridge Quantum Computing).

•  Alan Ransil (Protocol Labs): Compositional data structures for the decentralized web.

• Alberto Speranzon (Honeywell).

• Ryan Wisnesky (Conexus): Categorical informatics at scale.]]></description>

thanks.  open game theory sounds interesting.

economics is an issue in this area.

(it may be awhile before ACT goes mainstream--took quantum theory maybe 100 years.)]]></description>

Yes, but a lot of the ideas in applied category theory can be used in &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; applications.  For example: better databases (as being developed by David Spivak and Ryan Wisnewsky at Conexus), or better software for running organizations (as being developed by Jelle Herold and Fabrizio Genovese at Statebox), or open game theory for better economics.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[These are fascinating but above my pay grade.

I see they will be posted to youtube later (which is good---i don&#039;t want to sit in front of a computer for a week in summer--save them for a rainy or snowy day).

&#039;cyber kittens and categorical cybernetics&#039; has an interesting title, &#039;coarse graining of open markov processes&#039; i may understand a bit (long time topic from R C Tolman in 1930&#039;s), topics on language (they still look removed from the terminology used in debates between &#039;innatists and connectionists&#039;  in linguistics, and more.  Pierce&#039;s existential graphs is one topic i&#039;ve looked at and didn&#039;t understand or forgot.  (i have seen some papers on quantum field theory applied to Chomsky&#039;s &#039;minimalist program&#039; in linguistics. )

I sort of wonder if any of this applied CT has any applications to all the social unrest (protests etc.) , COVID , global warming and other issues in this area or the world.

It makes me think of some farmer in france or germany in 1800s tilling the soil who wonders whether s/he should study Gauss or Galois  rather than grow food.]]></description>
