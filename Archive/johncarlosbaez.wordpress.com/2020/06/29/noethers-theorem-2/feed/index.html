					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m curious if there is a simpler way to look at your last section; I&#039;m not a physicist and there is a great deal here let alone in the paper that I don&#039;t understand.  I&#039;m thinking the Hamiltonian is an energy distribution and you&#039;re dividing it by kT (joules) or hbar/t (torque in N*m = joules/radian). Work and torque * radians both represent force applied over a distance which can store or release energy, and using complex numbers seems to allow a single value to represent the direction.  More broadly, I would love to find a more intuitive explanation of Euler&#039;s identity and why and how the polar representation of complex numbers comes to be.  Can you draw a connection between i and radians as a unit?]]></description>

Thanks!  I explain everything in more detail in my paper than in this summary based on the introduction.   So, I hope it makes more sense.  If not, please ask questions.   Like every author of every paper, I&#039;m dying for questions from people who have actually looked at it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[John, I have followed you on Twitter ever since I wrote my undergraduate dissertation on Noether&#039;s Theorem a few (actually nearly five!) years ago. I found your writing on this topic really helpful back then, and while my background isn&#039;t really mathematical enough to understand everything here, it was an enjoyable read and I look forward to tackling your paper later. Thanks for writing about this truly fascinating and profound topic!]]></description>

Interesting!  I was tempted to generalize beyond Banach Lie groups, because classical mechanics as I described it doesn&#039;t easily fit in that framework: the relevant group is the group of Poisson diffeomorphisms of a Poisson manifold, and that&#039;s some more general sort of infinite-dimensional Lie group (unless one uses other tricks, which bring along their own technicalities).  But I decided that the essential points of the paper would be buried if I sank any deeper into questions like &quot;what&#039;s the best category of infinite-dimensional Lie groups?&quot;]]></description>

I should have added: the assignment $latex X \mapsto g$ is also postulated to be smooth for a regular Lie group, so this is rather strong!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Theorem 10 makes me wonder if a variant holds for all &quot;Milnor regular&quot; infinite-dimensional Lie groups. These are, roughly speaking, those Lie groups such that one has (unique) solutions to $latex g^{-1}dg = X$, where $latex X$ is a smooth curve in the Lie algebra. I think there is no known example of a non-regular Lie group.]]></description>
