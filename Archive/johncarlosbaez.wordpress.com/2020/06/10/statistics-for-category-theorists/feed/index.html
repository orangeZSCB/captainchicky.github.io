By the way, the obsessive focus on null hypotheses and significance testing is a mistake.   People are slowly switching to better methodologies.  I wish there were a free online version of Rindskopf&#039;s paper &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/nullhypothesis-tests-are-not-completely-stupid-but-bayesian-statistics-are-better/636881DA942AB7337AB473DE4B9D5E81&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Null-hypothesis tests are not completely stupid, but Bayesian statistics are better&lt;/a&gt;, but I don&#039;t see one.   These are free:

&#8226; Bruno Lecoutre, &lt;a&gt;The significance test controversy and the Bayesian alternative&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Encyclopedia of Mathematics&lt;/i&gt;.

&#8226; Jeffrey A. Gliner, Nancy L. Leech and George A, Morgan, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.andrews.edu/~rbailey/Chapter%20two/7217331.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Problems with null hypothesis significance testing (NHST): what do the textbooks say?&lt;/a&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for all the great links. I love reading about folks who are thinking about statistics and probability algebraically. One thing I have always wondered is if there is some category in which you can do statistics, and an associated category that maps those calculations to statements. I&#039;m always fascinated by the precise but seemingly convoluted logic of statistics, as in, we can not say that H1 is true, only that our calculations of a certain probability allows us to reject the validity of some Null hypothesis. This is the language of modern science. We don&#039;t prove a hypothesis is true, only that all competing hypothesis are wrong. Well, casually, we we just say, H1 is true. It all has the feeling of the logic the Bell uses in his calculus with infinitesimals book, constructive logic.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Shouldn’t it be easier for people to join?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It&#039;s quite easy.  In my blog article here it says &quot;If you want to join this reading group you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2020/03/25/category-theory-community-server/&quot;&gt;register&lt;/a&gt; for the Category Theory Community Server and then &lt;a href=&quot;https://categorytheory.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/232160-learning.3A-reading.20groups/topic/Statistics.20reading.20group/near/200202851&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;go here&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;  So just do that.]]></description>

I tried, but that directs you to a page saying you need an invitation without giving a link or contact address. Who sends out the invitation to join the zulip?

Given the recent talk of inclusion and broadening the community I wonder why the forum needs to be closed anyway - at least for reading if not for posting. Shouldn&#039;t it be easier for people to join?]]></description>

I was not doubting that but it is the  time element. I hope it is very successful as I think that the interplay of category theory with a whole lot of probabilistic and statistical problems could be very important in the future.]]></description>
