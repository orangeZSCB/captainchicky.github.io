					<description><![CDATA[Yes, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.law.columbia.edu/climatechange/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Climate Law Blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has been chronicling these all along.

I know it&#039;s early, but I think it would be wise for any party which supports the reversal of these atrocities against the natural world and ourselves to think carefully about what they need to do and how they need to proceed and talk to assure that environmental sensitivity is continued in 2024-2028.

I think being anti-business on any front is a sure way to limiting to one term.  I also think it would make sense to be really bipartisan, and reaching out to organizations like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.acc.eco/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;American Conservation Coalition&lt;/a&gt; and people like &lt;a href=&quot;https://benjibacker.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Benji Backer&lt;/a&gt;.

Yes, that happened on October 21st, after the October 15 update of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; article I got my information from.  Of course it&#039;s a slightly different kind of thing, but connected:
