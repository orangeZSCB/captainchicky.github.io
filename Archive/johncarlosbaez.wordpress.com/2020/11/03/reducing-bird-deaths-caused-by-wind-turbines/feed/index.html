Apparently rodents find it easy to dig burrows in the ground loosened by constructing the turbine, and this attracts raptors:

This picture is from a webpage claiming there&#039;s massive under-reporting of bird deaths due to wind turbines:

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;https://windmillskill.com/blog/wind-farms-slaughter-kept-hidden-public&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Wind farms: a slaughter kept hidden from the public&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Windmills Kill&lt;/i&gt;.

The issue has become politicized so everything everyone says needs to be taken with a grain of salt, and of course a single picture of a rabbit near a wind turbine proves little.   However, I once read from a trustworthy source that keeping rodents from nesting near the base of wind turbines was important.]]></description>

If the raptor death reduction bears out in larger trials, that is very good news.  &quot;It&#039;s also important to keep rodents from nesting near the base of the wind turbine.&quot;  Sounds like a problem where cats would be a good solution.  (:]]></description>

It&#039;s true: cats here kill lots of lizards and I bet also lots of finches and sparrows, but probably never any hawks.  The &quot;Paint it Black&quot; study claimed that painting one blade of wind turbine black is especially good at preventing raptor deaths.  I&#039;ve also read it&#039;s important to keep rodents from nesting near the base of the wind turbine.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is good news.  However, with respect to the relative number of bird deaths, one has to keep in mind that the birds the wind turbines kill are different than the birds killed by cats, for instance.  The former  tend to be large birds (ie raptors) and the latter, abundant and small bird species like sparrows.]]></description>
