I think it is a good idea. Plastic is like rocks. An almost eternal sink of any molecule put into it. The reason that millions of people have not learned to throw it away properly is a bad argument for not using it. Just stop throwing it into nature, rivers, the sea. Everyone can do this little him/herself. If not, then don&#039;t even think about other changes of daily behavior needed to find solutions.]]></description>

I would not blame carbon dioxide. Yes, it is a greenhouse gas. But blaming it on carbon dioxide alone is in my opinion a viewpoint far too narrow. The real problem is overpopulation and an economic system based on eternal growth. Mankind will face more challenges, and more difficult ones, other than climate change, because our consumption of resources will hit a wall in many ways. It is not only oil. It is about a lot of basic metals (and despite the fact that they are usually well recyclable), it is about helium (just imagine no MRI machine is working anymore), even sand usable for concrete is a limited resource! We cannot face climate change, if we do not face these problems, too, and maybe first, because it will depend on our abilities for technological improvement, how good or bad the outcome will be.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi John,

I wonder if you have a recent reference in mind for the idea that mature forests approach steady states in terms of carbon sequestration.

Wohlleben&#039;s Chapter 16 of &lt;em&gt;The Hidden Life of Trees&lt;/em&gt; argues that this is not true drawing on the 2009 report &lt;em&gt;CarboEurope-IP: An Assessment of the European Terrestrial Carbon balance&lt;/em&gt; (available here: ftp://ftp.bgc-jena.mpg.de/pub/outgoing/athuille/CE_booklet_final_packed/CE_booklet_Stand_02-03-09_screen.pdf).

From page 21 of the report.

It is generally thought that with ageing, old-growth forests as shown in Fig. 17 cease to accumulate carbon and are therefore carbon-neutral. For that reason they are not yet included in international treaties. But evidence examined by CarboEurope-IP suggests that these forests continue to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at rates that vary with climate and nitrogen deposition (see Page 30). The sequestered carbon dioxide is stored in live woody tissues and slowly decomposing organic matter in litter and soil. Old-growth forests therefore serve as a global carbon dioxide sink. Searching the literature and data- bases for forest carbon-flux estimates, revealed that in forests between 15 and 800 years of age, biomass continues to increase with age and the ratio of respiration over growth does not approach an equilibrium with age. Luyssaert et al. (2008) demonstrate that “the long standing view of forest growth seems to be deficient and even old growth forest continue to take up carbon. This means that for the next decades they will be sinks”. The ratio of respiration and growth remains below 1 up to very old stand ages.

A look at the graphs suggests that the rate of carbon sequestration per hectare of forest increases with age. The rate is perhaps quadratic in age? Take a look at Figure 18.

The guess from the report is that unmanaged primary forest accounts for 1.3 ± 0.5 sequestering gigatonnes of carbon per year, so this doesn&#039;t really make a difference in terms of your main argument. However, it does argue for preservation of existing forests as one expects their carbon sequestering abilities to &lt;em&gt;improve&lt;/em&gt; with time.

Yours,
Ben Antieau]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[All of the drawdown scenarios described here are well within the ability of our built environments to sequester CO2 at scale. 
A massive operation to sink crop residues to the bottom of the sea could just as well be insulating fibres sequestered as building products, as demand for renewables and low e building accelerates. Urban Mining existing materials, (industrial agricultural commercial), the necessary renewal of cities suggests a logical pathway to resource streams currently considered waste.
