&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I don&#039;t know how to do that.  I think of cocomplete categories and abelian groups as two not-very-close cousins in the family of &quot;gadgets with addition&quot;.

1) I think of abelian groups as a special case of commutative monoids.

2) I think of commutative monoids as a special case of symmetric monoidal categories.

3) I think of cocartesian categories as another special case of symmetric monoidal categories.  These are categories with finite coproducts, and I think of coproduct as &quot;addition&quot;.

4) I think of cocomplete categories as a special case of cocartesian categories.  These are categories where we can take the colimit of any diagram, not just diagrams that consist of a finite set of objects and no morphisms.  This is a remarkable enhancement of the concept of addition.

For each of these &quot;gadgets with addition&quot; it&#039;s important to understand the &quot;free gadget on 1, the terminal set&quot;.

1) The free abelian group on 1 is $latex \mathbb{Z}$.

2) The free commutative monoid on 1 is $latex \mathbb{N}$.

3) The free symmetric monoidal category on 1 is what I call $latex \mathsf{S}$, the groupoid of finite sets and bijections.

4) The free category with finite coproducts on 1 is $latex \mathsf{FinSet}$, the category of finite sets and functions.

5) The free cocomplete category on 1 is $latex \mathsf{Set}$.

All 5 of these things are fundamental in mathematics!  They&#039;re different variants of the same idea.  Each of them, being a free gadget with addition on 1, automatically gets a multiplication that distributes over addition.  (I leave it as a puzzle to see why.)

Note that I climbed a ladder of generality from 1) to 3) and then back down a different ladder from 3) to 5).  As a result, we have maps

$latex \mathbb{Z} \leftarrow \mathbb{N} \leftarrow \mathsf{S} \rightarrow \mathsf{FinSet} \rightarrow \mathsf{Set} $

The gadgets here are all symmetric monoidal categories (where we think of commutative monoids as symmetric monoidal categories with only identity morphisms).   The maps are all symmetric monoidal functors, meaning they preserve addition.   But in fact all the gadgets are &#039;symmetric rig categories&#039;, meaning they also have a multiplication that distributes over addition.  And all the maps are maps of symmetric rig categories!

This is part of what I call the &#039;backbone&#039; of mathematics: the most important structures, and their most important relationships.

Math is great!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2020/01/28/topos-theory-part-5/#comment-158170&quot;&gt;John Baez&lt;/a&gt;.

I see. So this explains why it&#039;s not too surprising to find my “UFS = U[blah]^S” in the wild.

It brings to mind another easy example: Take the free meet semilattice FS on a set S. The underlying set UFS can be identified with the set of all functions S --&#062; {0,1}, i.e. the power set of S.

Interestingly, though, this example seems genuinely different than the abelian group example, in that there’s a way to first equip S and {0,1} with common structure before applying the free functor to S. This is a familiar story, but I’ll share it here. I think it goes like this:

Start with the walking arrow 2 = {0 ≤ 1} or, perhaps more fitting in this context, &quot;the cocomplete category of truth values.&quot; So 2 is a poset-with-all-meets. What’s nice is that any set S can also be viewed as a poset—which I&#039;ll also denote by S—with s ≤ s’ iff s = s&#039;, in which case S = S^op. So, I believe, we can quite literally ask for its free cocompletion (where 2 now takes the place of Set, as in the previous comment) to get the power set FS = 2^S with subset inclusion as the partial order.

I hope I’ve gotten this right. If so, it seems pretty crucial to this example that “any set S can be viewed a poset.” (I realize there is a [en]rich[ed] theory behind this: &lt;em&gt;Categories enriched over 2 are posets!&lt;/em&gt;)

The abelian group example appears to be lacking a statement analogous to this.

This disconnect—if I’m assessing correctly—is puzzling to me. It’s like an obvious mystery waiting to be solved! (“Let’s find a way to treat the integers Z as a category so that Z^S is literally the free cocompletion of S!”) And yet I haven’t found much discussion in this area. Or maybe I&#039;m not looking in the right places.

But &lt;em&gt;now,&lt;/em&gt; actually, I&#039;m starting to wonder whether that quest isn’t too interesting from a categorical perspective—and perhaps there&#039;s no real mystery—because it&#039;s the &lt;em&gt;adjunction&lt;/em&gt; that&#039;s at the heart of everything, lying there in plain sight!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2020/01/28/topos-theory-part-5/#comment-158153&quot;&gt;Tai-Danae Bradley&lt;/a&gt;.

A second comment, more to the point of your question.  The group $latex \mathbb{Z}$ shows up in this game because it&#039;s the free abelian group on the terminal set, 1.  Since the functor

F: Set &#8594; AbGp

is a left adjoint, it preserves colimits.  Every set S is a coproduct of S copies of 1.  So, for every set S, FS is a coproduct of S copies of $latex \mathbb{Z}.$  When S is &lt;i&gt;finite&lt;/i&gt;, this gives

FS &#8773; $latex \mathbb{Z}^S$

But what&#039;s true in general is that FS is isomorphic to what I call $latex \mathbb{Z}[S]$: the set of all finite  $latex \mathbb{Z}$-linear combinations of elements of S.

All this has a partial analogue in the categorified case, because Set is the free cocomplete category on the terminal category, which I&#039;ll also call 1.  Alas, it&#039;s not true that every category C is a coproduct or even colimit of copies of 1.   But it&#039;s a colimit of copies of 2, the &#039;walking arrow&#039;, the category with two objects and just one non-identity morphism, which goes from the first object to the second.  I&#039;m not sure if the functor

F: Cat &#8594; CocompleteCat

is a left adjoint; as mentioned in my last comment this can only work if &quot;Cat&quot; means the category of &lt;em&gt;large&lt;/em&gt; categories, since the cocompletion even of a small category is typically large, and if F is a left adjoint we&#039;ll need a right adjoint

U: CocompleteCat &#8594; Cat

However, I believe the &quot;free cococomplete category&quot; functor

F: Cat &#8594; CocompleteCat

preserve colimits regardless of whether Cat stands for the category of small categories or the category of large categories.  So, for any category C, FC will be a colimit of copies of F2, and we can check by hand that

$latex F2 \cong {\mathrm{Set}}^{2^{\mathrm{op}}}$

I guess that if I were smart enough I could easily go from this to showing

$latex FC\cong {\mathrm{Set}}^{C^{\mathrm{op}}}$

whenever C is a small category.  As mentioned in my last comment, this formula isn&#039;t true when C is a large category.  But again, there&#039;s a modification of this formula that is true.

So the case of

F: Set &#8594; AbGp

is clean, while the other case is less so.  Luckily, the &quot;free vector space on a set&quot;, the &quot;free group on a set&quot;, and so on, all work just as cleanly as the free abelian group on a set!]]></description>

Hi!   There&#039;s a lot to say about this, probably more than I know, but here&#039;s something to get the ball rolling.

First, some technical crud that I feel obliged to mention.  There&#039;s an adjunction between sets and abelian groups.  There&#039;s also something like an adjunction between categories and cocomplete categories, though this is a bit slippery due to size issues: the category of presheaves on a small category is usually a large cocomplete category, but the underlying category of such a cocomplete category is usually not small!   And in fact a miniature version of these &#039;size issues&#039; afflicts what you wrote too: you mentioned an adjunction between abelian groups and finite sets, but that doesn&#039;t really exist: the free abelian group on a finite set is usually infinite, but the underlying set of such an abelian group is usually not finite.

You can read more about the first problem &lt;a href=&quot;https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/free+cocompletion&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  Briefly, the free cocompletion of a small category C is the category of functors from C&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt; to Set.   A large category C also has a free cocompletion, but we don&#039;t get it by taking &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; functors from C&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt; to Set, just those that are &#039;small&#039; in some sense.

The second problem is much more familiar but similar.  The free abelian group on a finite set S is the set of all functions from S to $latex \mathbb{Z}$.   An infinite set also has a free abelian group on it, but we don&#039;t get it by taking &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; functions from S to $latex \mathbb{Z}$, just those that are zero except at finitely many points of S.  This is again a kind of &#039;smallness&#039; condition.

(And yes, I should have said &lt;i&gt;the underlying category of&lt;/i&gt; the free cocompletion of a small category C is the category of functors from C&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt; to the &lt;i&gt;underlying category&lt;/i&gt; of the cocomplete category Set, and &lt;i&gt;the underlying set of&lt;/i&gt; the  free abelian group on a finite set S is the set of all functions from S to &lt;i&gt;the underlying set of&lt;/i&gt;the abelian group $latex \mathbb{Z}.$)

All this is less interesting than what I really wanted to say, but I felt I needed to put these technicalities on the record before going ahead!   It&#039;s late now; I&#039;ll say more later.  See you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi John, I love the story about the category of presheaves being analogous to the free abelian group on a finite set S. It seems the latter isn’t literally &quot;the free cocompletion of S,&quot; which bugs me. (I might’ve asked you about this a while ago.) But it looks like they are connected in a broader way.

They both seem to be part of a special kind of free-forgetful adjunction F ⊣ U. It’s special in that there exists a fixed, special object [blah] (say, the integers or the category Set) such that free object FX on an object X has the property that UFX can be identified with all morphisms X --&#062; U[blah].

In one case, the adjunction is between abelian groups and finite sets, and [blah] is the group of integers Z. The free abelian group FS on S can be identified with the set of functions S --&#062; UZ, so that UFS = UZ^S. (I think the U is pretty revealing here. It fixes the [nit-picky] problem that the types of S and Z don’t match in the phrase “a morphism S --&#062; Z,” or in the notation Z^S.)

In the other case, the adjunction must be, I imagine, between cocomplete categories and plain categories, and [blah] is Set (or any other cocomplete enriching category). The units of these adjunctions are the usual S --&#062; UZ^S and the (enriched) Yoneda embedding, and they fit into the nice, familiar universal properties.

I’ve fleshed out a bit on my own. It seems fine for a while, but things become murky when I want to do other things down the road. But this is all pretty elementary—adjunctions are bread and butter!—so I’m sure category theorists already know exactly what’s going on.

Do you know if a particular kind of “free forgetful adjunction with a special object [blah]&quot; has been investigated by anyone? Perhaps even on the nLab, nCafe, or in a paper somewhere? It’s hard to believe a story as great as this has gone untouched.]]></description>
