Thanks for your reply John Baez.  I will try to share this post and your reply with my group. (I also shared the  post on Einstein and Schrodinger--since the previous discussion was on quantum theory--Adam Becker&#039;s book  &#039;what is real&#039; about Bohmian mechanics--, and with another group i&#039;m in i shared ones on climate change issues--i view this blog as  somewhat like an encyclopedia. )

Much of what i know about entropy and nonequilibrium thermodynamics  derives from books and papers by Ilya Prigogine  so i think more in terms like &#039;dissipative structures in chemical reactions and ecosystems&#039;.  Gravity is a bit beyond my reach though its the same principal.

(I had to look up &#039;etale&#039; and &#039;sheaf&#039;&#039; in your course on topos theory--this is beyond me, but i like the formalism and ideas. ) .

I think https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crooks_fluctuation_theorem sort of gives the same answer you suggested.]]></description>

  1 kibibyte is 1024 bytes, not 10^24 bytes
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ha!  The first time I tried to post my comment Wordpress destroyed all the scientific notation, changing things like 2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; to 210.  The second time I tried to post it, Wordpress did it again. The third time I figured out a way around the problem---but I was tired by then, and I changed 1024 to 10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;.   &lt;img src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/emoticons/tongue2.gif&quot; /&gt;]]></description>

It&#039;s definitely fun to look at that bright dot close up!

I don&#039;t know the reason for those artifacts.  I can just quote you a bit from the ESO website of how this image was made, and we can try to imagine what&#039;s going on:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  “Observations of the bulge of the Milky Way are very hard because it is obscured by dust,” says Dante Minniti (Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Chile), co-author of the study. “To peer into the heart of the galaxy, we need to observe in infrared light, which is less affected by the dust.”
  
  The large mirror, wide field of view and very sensitive infrared detectors of ESO’s 4.1-metre Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy (VISTA) make it by far the best tool for this job. The team of astronomers is using data from the VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea programme (VVV) [1], one of six public surveys carried out with VISTA. The data have been used to create a monumental 108 200 by 81 500 pixel colour image containing nearly nine billion pixels. This is one of the biggest astronomical images ever produced. The team has now used these data to compile the largest catalogue of the central concentration of stars in the Milky Way ever created [2].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  [1] The VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) survey is an ESO public survey dedicated to scanning the southern plane and bulge of the Milky Way through five near-infrared filters. It started in 2010 and was granted a total of 1929 hours of observing time over a five-year period. Via Lactea is the Latin name for the Milky Way.

[2] The image used in this work covers about 315 square degrees of the sky (a bit less than 1% of the entire sky) and observations were carried out using three different infrared filters. The catalogue lists the positions of the stars along with their measured brightnesses through the different filters. It contains about 173 million objects, of which about 84 million have been confirmed as stars. The other objects were either too faint or blended with their neighbours or affected by other artefacts, so that accurate measurements were not possible. Others were extended objects such as distant galaxies.

  The image used here required a huge amount of data processing, which was performed by Ignacio Toledo at the ALMA OSF. It corresponds to a pixel scale of 0.6 arcseconds per pixel, down-sampled from the original pixel scale of 0.34 arcseconds per pixel.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  Not everyone agrees on the definition of ‘kilobyte’, ‘megabyte’, ‘gigabyte’, and so on! Originally people used ‘kilobyte’ to mean not 1000 but 10^24 bytes, since 10^24 = 2^10, and powers of 2 are nicer when you’re using binary.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I&#039;ve noticed a typo in your comment.
1 kibibyte is 1024 bytes, not 10^24 bytes. And 10^24 bytes is not 2^10 bytes.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  2^10 bytes is now officially a kibibyte, 2^20 bytes is a mebibyte, and so on. But I haven’t heard people actually say these words.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many FOSS utilities use the terms KiB, MiB and GiB to refer to kibibytes, mebibytes and gigibytes. Some use K, M and G without the &#039;B&#039; to refer to kibibytes and others. I&#039;ve only seen developers using these terms. This might be because in schools and many other places a kilobyte is used to mean 1024 bytes instead of 1000 bytes.]]></description>
