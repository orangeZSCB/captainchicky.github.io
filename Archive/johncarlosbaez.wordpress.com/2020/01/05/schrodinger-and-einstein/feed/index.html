&quot;I came to the conclusion that I was not competent enough to prepare a report in a way that really corresponded to the state of things. ...Partly because my abilities are not enough to fully embrace the rapid development of the theory, but also because I do not share the purely statistical way of thinking on which it is based&quot;

This is the Dirty Harry equivalent of saying &quot;A man&#039;s gotta know his limitations&quot;

A really revealing quote indeed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2020/01/05/schrodinger-and-einstein/#comment-158195&quot;&gt;Alexey Bekasov&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks!  This passage shows how Einstein had become quite alienated from quantum theory by 1927:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  Hendrik Anton Lorentz, President of the Solvay Scientific Committee, invited Einstein to deliver a plenary report at the congress. In a letter dated May 1, 1926, the great physicist agreed, emphasizing respect for his senior colleague: “If you want me to take up a report on quantum statistics, I will do it with pleasure, because if I’m not in a particularly difficult situation, then I can never say “no” to you&quot; (Mehra-Rechenberg - 6, 2000, p. 234).
  
  However, after serious reflection, Einstein refused to give a report at the Fifth Solvay Congress. In a letter to Lorentz dated June 17, 1927, he admitted: “I remember that I promised you to prepare a report on quantum statistics for the Solvay Conference. After much hesitation, I came to the conclusion that I was not competent enough to prepare a report in a way that really corresponded to the state of things. The reason is that I am not able to actively participate in the modern development of quantum theory to the extent that it is necessary for the goal. Partly because my abilities are not enough to fully embrace the rapid development of the theory, but also because I do not share the purely statistical way of thinking on which it is based ... Until the last moment I continued to hope that I could bring something to Brussels valuable. Now I have abandoned this hope. I ask you not to be angry with me because of this; it was not easy for me, although I tried my best” (Mehra - Rechenberg - 6, 2000, p. 241).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

That was my one-sentence explanation for why they spent so much time trying to unify classical electromagnetism and general relativity when other great physicists of their era (Pauli, Dirac, Heisenberg, etc.) were working on quantum field theory and fascinated by nucleons, mesons, neutrinos etc.   It&#039;s oversimplified---but Einstein and Schr&#246;dinger really did go in a different direction from the rest of the pack because of their reluctance to embrace quantum mechanics and especially quantum field theory.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  At least in some fields, a majority of physicists believe in the multiverse.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

How would you characterize those fields?  Would you say a majority of cosmologists believe in the multiverse, or just &quot;theoretical cosmologists&quot;, or just &quot;string-theoretic theoretical cosmologists&quot;, or what?]]></description>

&quot;Schweinerei&quot; is an expression quite rich in connotations. As a native german I would understand it both as &quot;awful mess&quot; but also with an expression of malice if referring to someone&#039;s actions. Thus, a messy place may be called like this, but also the action of someone which produced it, and even the ethical stance leading to this action, if it was done on purpose, especially if oneself is the victim of it (this would match &quot;skulduggery&quot;).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;&quot;Schrödinger fled Austria after the Nazis took over. In 1940 he got a job at the brand-new Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;

Before he came, he made sure that his unorthodox living arrangements wouldn&#039;t be a problem.  Schrödinger had a fascination, shall we say, for young girls, but also older women (not necessarily older than him, but women instead of girls), and when he moved to Dublin did so with his wife and mistress.  His wife knew about his sex life and didn&#039;t mind, as she had an interesting one of her own, her lover being none other than Hermann Weyl (whom she called Peter; his full name was Hermann Klaus Hugo Weyl).

I mention this as it is another similarity shared by Schrödinger and Einstein, who apparently had many groupies and wasted no time cutting to the chase.

Interesting that Einstein, Weyl, and Schrödinger were all interested in another sort of unification, so to speak.

Eddington, by contrast, never married, and lived with his mother and sister.  (Whether he was gay, I don&#039;t know.  I recently learned that &quot;he never married&quot; was a common euphemism for homosexuality in obituaries.  (And it was decades after I watched western films on television that I realized that all the dancing girls in the saloons of the Old West were of course mostly prostitutes.)  Of course, like Händel (also suspected by some of being gay), at that time and place he would have had to keep everything under wraps.]]></description>

I&#039;ve heard &quot;skulduggery&quot; as a translation for &quot;Schweinerei&quot;, but that is not accurate.  Having lived most of my life in Germany, but as a native speaker of (only) English, my own description would be &quot;a bad situation intentionally provoked by someone who should have known better, usually to further their own personal gain, with ill consequences for others which are much greater than the gain produced&quot;.]]></description>
