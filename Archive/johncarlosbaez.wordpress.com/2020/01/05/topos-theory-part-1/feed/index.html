I always link to whatever I think offers the best explanation for the audience I have in mind.  For people who have never heard of a subobject classifier, I feel the hand-holding &quot;introductory explanation&quot; of subobject classifiers in Wikipedia does what I want.   Of course everyone serious about category theory should consult the nLab too.]]></description>

I have McLarty&#039;s book and I&#039;d say it focuses more than MacLane and Moerdijk do on applications of elementary topoi to logic, much less on sheaves, Grothendieck topoi and the roots of topos theory in algebraic geometry.  It&#039;s also a &lt;em&gt;shorter&lt;/em&gt; book.]]></description>

I don&#039;t there&#039;s any &quot;cash value&quot; for Bohr toposes yet.  I wrote about some similar stuff long ago in This Week&#039;s Finds: it&#039;s nice how there&#039;s a poset of commutative subalgebras of a general C*-algebra, which give a preheaf of different &quot;classical views&quot; of a quantum system... but if you&#039;re mainly interested in physics rather than topos theory, it&#039;s safe to wait until a bunch of people shout &quot;Eureka!&quot;

Topos theory is interesting for &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; reasons.]]></description>

Yeah, it may not be completely clear, even for &lt;a href=&quot;https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2011/07/bohr_toposes.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Urs Schreiber&lt;/a&gt; who is the principal author of the relevant nLab articles, what that cash value is. Far be it from me to say much about it, except that there is this potential of bringing a huge wealth of experience with toposes to bear (googling &quot;Bohr topos&quot; will reveal some of this).

Urs makes a concerted effort to explain the relevant issues where the Bohr topos provides a convenient conceptual framework, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/order-theoretic+structure+in+quantum+mechanics&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. He emphasizes the close connection between the poset of commutative $latex \ast$-subalgebras and the underlying Jordan algebra, and that this together with the actual commutative algebra structures are what is key to the physics. But I&#039;d better quit here.]]></description>

The &quot;Bohr topos&quot; material has the appeal that the developers appear to have thought more carefully than is typical about what Bohr himself wrote. He could be quite a foggy writer, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-1454-9_4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;problem compounded&lt;/a&gt; by later generations simply not reading the pieces where he was the clearest and by the fact that very often he wasn&#039;t thinking about the same questions that those later generations had in mind.

I&#039;m not yet seeing what I might crassly call the &quot;cash value&quot; of Bohr toposes &#8212; yes, we can define all these things, but what do they make more clear than before? Maybe this series will shake something loose for me. My own work has fallen closer to the &quot;generalized probabilistic theories&quot; side, so I&#039;d like to see the pieces fit together.]]></description>

Of course there&#039;s a general notion of a point of a (Grothendieck) topos $latex E$, namely a so-called geometric morphism $latex \text{Set} \to E$. In the special case where $latex E$ is sheaves on a topological space, this is exactly the skyscaper sheaf construction which associates such a geometric morphism to a point of the space (it&#039;s no coincidence that the topos points in this case are in natural bijection with spatial points, at least if the space is a sober space). In other words, topos points are the same as generalized skyscapers. In the special case of sheaves over a space, the left exact left adjoint $latex E \to \text{Set}$ of the skyscaper morphism is &quot;take the stalk at that point&quot;.]]></description>

At first I was going, &quot;what is this key topic called SGL that I&#039;ve never heard of?&quot; Until it dawned on me that it&#039;s not a topic but a famous book about a topic, Sheaves in Geometry and Logic, the one John says he&#039;s using for the course. Usually I refer to it as &quot;Mac Lane and Moerdijk&quot;.

(Good luck with the course, John!)

I don&#039;t know McLarty&#039;s book intimately, but recently had to take a look at it. It&#039;s nice I think. For example, he outlines the hands-on construction of finite colimits in a topos, whereas Mac Lane and Moerdijk take the more abstract approach given via Par&#233;&#039;s theorem. He also goes into some loving detail about topics not well-covered by Mac Lane and Moerdijk, such as toposes for SDG (Synthetic Differential Geometry) and the effective topos. So in some sense the books are nicely complementary.]]></description>
