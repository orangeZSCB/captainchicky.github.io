I see, ok... interesting that they are attracted. I thought that one has to force them into the plane first (or independently from the remaining laser experiment). Thanks for the explanation.]]></description>

There&#039;s no fifth laser beam. I believe the atoms are attracted to places where the light is brightest.  Since the light is brightest near a plane, the atoms stay near that plane.

The Wikipedia article on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_lattice&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;optical lattices&lt;/a&gt; says that neutral atoms are trapped in the light thanks to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stark_effect&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Stark effect&lt;/a&gt;: an effect where an electric field changes the energies of atomic orbitals.  The Wikipedia article doesn&#039;t condescend to say whether the atoms&#039; energies are lower in the bright regions or the dim regions.  But I&#039;m guessing they must be lower in the bright regions.  Otherwise they wouldn&#039;t stay in the laser beams!]]></description>

Yes, I think I understood this part, but there must be some sort of confinement laser field that prevents the atoms from moving outwards in a direction perpendicular to the quasiperiodic plane? I mean, if they might have a fifth laser in the z direction creating a periodic potential this could already explain it. Then I wonder, what happens if you first localize the atoms and then switch of this perpendicular laser?]]></description>

The potassium atoms lie in a 2d plane.  They don&#039;t form a &quot;jet&quot;, they&#039;re just attracted to points where the potential is lowest.   This potential is created by the standing waves formed by intersecting laser beams.  That&#039;s how an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_lattice&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;optical lattice&lt;/a&gt; works.

But while an ordinary optical lattice creates a periodic potential, so that the atoms arrange themselves in a kind of crystalline pattern, here the beams are cleverly arranged so that the atoms form a quasicrystalline pattern --- that is, a pattern that never quite repeats itself.   To make things even more exciting, the atoms are in a Bose--Einstein condensate, meaning that every atom is doing &lt;em&gt;exactly the same thing as every other&lt;/em&gt;.

If you turn up the strength of the laser beams, the condensate &#039;localizes&#039;, meaning that the wavefunction of all the atoms becomes sharply peaked near one point.

All this is happening at extremely low temperatures, with merely 300,000 atoms, and it lasts for much less than a second.  It&#039;s absolutely useless for any sort of practical device, at least currently.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wonder, since this localization seems to happen in the 2D plane (there are no 3D octagonal quasicrystals), do the trapped atoms at some point form a kind of jet in the direction perpendicular to the quasicrystalline plane, and can&#039;t this be used to make a laser kind of machine for these atoms?]]></description>

Yes, all this fits in perfectly with that quote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  The term ‘superfluid quasicrystal’ sounds like something a comic-book villain might use to carry out his dastardly plans.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

them: you can&#039;t just put science words together and call it science

physics: superfluid quasicrystal

them: no

This post was about condensed matter physics so I thought we were talking about composite bosons that can be understood well using nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, like Cooper pairs or helium-4 atoms (thought of as a bound state of a bosonic helium-4 nucleus and two electrons).

Everything gets more complicated in quantum field theory, and I don&#039;t really want to think about bound states in quantum field theory today!   It&#039;s been a productive day so far. &lt;img src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/emoticons/tongue2.gif&quot;/&gt;]]></description>

My understanding is that this only works for non-interacting particles. The S-matrix gives you amplitudes between initial and final states, which are supposed to be asymptotically free. Bound states are S-matrix poles. I admit, this has always been confusing to me, because what&#039;s a &quot;free proton&quot;? If you turn off strong interactions, doesn&#039;t it fall apart?]]></description>

I had a vague impression that this effect has been seen experimentally, but I&#039;m not sure.

I&#039;m not sure what you&#039;re saying is naive.  My model of a bound state as an antisymmetrized tensor product of two single-particle position eigenstates

$latex e_i \otimes e_{i+1} - e_{i+1} \otimes e_i$

is &lt;i&gt;extremely&lt;/i&gt; naive; it&#039;s the simplest model that illustrates what&#039;s going on.]]></description>
