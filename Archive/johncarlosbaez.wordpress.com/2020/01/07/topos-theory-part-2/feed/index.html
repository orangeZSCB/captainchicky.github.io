In a presheaf, the restriction maps are often not injective, and often not surjective.  For example, consider the sheaf on the real line, where $latex FU$ is the set of continuous functions $latex f \colon U \to \mathbb{R}$ on the open set $latex U \subseteq R.$   Here restriction is neither injective nor surjective, in general.]]></description>

Thanks!  You&#039;re right about these typos.  I&#039;ve tried to fix both of them.

By the way, to get LaTeX to work here, follow the instructions right above the box in which you type your comment.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Some possible typos (just before the puzzle about showing the projection map is continuous):

you said “We just need to put a topology on $\Lambda(X)$”--I think you meant $\Lambda(F)$;

you said “We take the collection of all these germs to be an open neighbourhood of $x$”--I think instead of $x$ you meant the unnamed point introduced in a previous sentence “More specifically, any point in $\Lambda(F)$ is in some set $\Lambda(F)_x$...”.

Thanks a lot for these posts JB!]]></description>

Thank you for your comment.
You and John helped me a lot to think deeper to this subject.

I think that now I&#039;m a bit more closer to the question of the germ. Let&#039;s see if I&#039;m loosing something else!

What I&#039;m not able to do is to be certain of &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; the restrictions $latex FU \to FU&#039;$ produce equivalent classes.

When I think to the case in which the open subsets are finite sets, then I see how the equivalent classes emerge.

E.g., let $latex U = \{1,2,3\}$ and $latex U&#039; = \{2,3\}$; and let the functions picked by the presheaf $latex F$ be functions with codomain the set $latex B = \{0,1\}$, then:

$latex FU$ has $latex 2^3$ functions
$latex FU&#039;$ has $latex 2^2$ functions

A &lt;em&gt;restriction&lt;/em&gt; $latex FU \to FU&#039;$ should be a &lt;em&gt;surjective function&lt;/em&gt;, partitioning $latex FU$ in 4 parts, where each part contains 2 function.
In summary, the equivalence classes here are due to the surjectivity, surjectivity which is motivated by the fact that $latex F$ is built to get &lt;em&gt;all functions&lt;/em&gt; of type $latex U \to B,\ \forall U \in O(X)$, hence in term of cardinality $latex U&#039; \subset U \implies \# FU &#062; \# FU&#039;$.

Considering continuous functions of type $latex \mathbb R \to \mathbb R$, I think that the intuition is similar: we need to prove that the restrictions are surjective morphisms; but I&#039;m not able to prove it, because the simple cardinality argument discussed so far doesn&#039;t work anymore.

From a categorical point of view, the surjectivity in the Set category is identified by the &lt;em&gt;epimorphisms&lt;/em&gt;: given any $latex h,g:A \to B$, then a function $latex f:B \to C$ is an epimorphism if and only if $latex g \circ f = h \circ f \implies g=h$.

But in the category $latex O(X)$ there is at most one single morphism between any two open subsets of $latex X$. This means that &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; morphism in this category is an epimorphism.

The last passage is the following. Using the presheaf $latex F:O(X) \to \mathrm{Set}$, the &lt;em&gt;subcategory&lt;/em&gt; $latex F[O(X)]$ of Set has the same property: no more than one morphism between any two object. Hence any of their morphism is an epimorphism.

Should this imply that these morphisms are surjective?]]></description>

As John said, usually there is no smallest open set $latex U ^ *$ owning $latex x$ (that is, there is no smallest &lt;em&gt;neighbourhood&lt;/em&gt; of $latex x$).  But let&amp;apos;s consider when there is.  Then as you said, $latex \Lambda ( F ) _ x$ can simply be $latex F U ^ *$, a set of functions on $latex U ^ *$.  But &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; set is not meant to be a germ; it&#039;s an &lt;em&gt;individual&lt;/em&gt; element of $latex F U ^ *$ that&amp;apos;s meant to be a germ.  And that works, because even though a germ is normally taken to be a set of functions (an equivalence class), in this case where $latex U ^ *$ is the smallest neighbourhood of $latex x$, each equivalence class consists of a single function on $latex U ^ *$.  (Part of the reason is that in the definition of a germ, two functions are only equivalent if there is a &lt;em&gt;neighbourhood&lt;/em&gt; of $latex x$ on which they are equal.)

Indeed, if every point in every topological space had a smallest neighbourhood, then there would be no need to define a germ as an equivalence class!  It&#039;s precisely because there usually is no smallest neighbourhood that we instead have to define a germ in a relatively complicated way.  A germ at $latex x$ is what &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; be a function on the smallest neighbourhood of $latex x$ if there were such a thing.  (In nonstandard analysis, you can talk about &lt;em&gt;infinitesimal&lt;/em&gt; neighbourhoods, and then a germ at $latex x$ can simply be defined as a standard function on an infinitesimal neighbourhood of $latex x$.)]]></description>

<p>Indeed, if every point in every topological space had a smallest neighbourhood, then there would be no need to define a germ as an equivalence class!  It&#8217;s precisely because there usually is no smallest neighbourhood that we instead have to define a germ in a relatively complicated way.  A germ at <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> is what <em>would</em> be a function on the smallest neighbourhood of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> if there were such a thing.  (In nonstandard analysis, you can talk about <em>infinitesimal</em> neighbourhoods, and then a germ at <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> can simply be defined as a standard function on an infinitesimal neighbourhood of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" />.)</p>

Right.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  Then $latex \Lambda (F)_x$ is a set of functions defined on the &lt;em&gt;smallest&lt;/em&gt; open subset $latex U^* \in O(X),\ x \in U^*$ (that is, $latex \nexists U \in O(X),\ x \in U$ and $latex U \subset U^*$ and not $latex U^* \subset U$).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That&#039;s true if there exists a smallest open set containing $latex x.$  But in most examples that&#039;s not true!  For example if $latex X$ is the real line, or the complex plane, there is no smallest open set containing a point.

So, you need to stop thinking about the case where there exists a smallest open set containing the point $latex x,$ and start thinking about these other examples.  Then you&#039;ll see that a germ at $latex x,$ defined as I defined it, is indeed an equivalence class of functions defined on open sets containing $latex x,$ where two functions are equivalent if they become equal when restricted to a small enough open set.  This is how colimits work in this example.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You wrote to consider $latex FU$ as a set of functions defined on $latex U \in O(X)$

We defined $latex \Lambda (F)_x$ as the &lt;em&gt;colimit&lt;/em&gt; of $latex FU$ for all $latex U \in O(X),\ x \in U$.

Then $latex \Lambda (F)_x$ is a set of functions defined on the &lt;em&gt;smallest&lt;/em&gt; open subset $latex U^* \in O(X),\ x \in U^*$ (that is, $latex \nexists U \in O(X),\ x \in U$ and $latex U \subset U^*$ and not $latex U^* \subset U$).

Then you consider the elements of $latex \Lambda (F)_x$ &lt;strong&gt;germs&lt;/strong&gt; at $latex x$.

This is what I don&#039;t get. Because the definition which I remember for a germ of function at $latex x$ is a &lt;em&gt;class of equivalence&lt;/em&gt; of functions, for which there is a subset containing $x$ where they are &lt;em&gt;equal&lt;/em&gt;.

But the restricted functions in $latex \Lambda (F)_x$ are not necessarily equal in that smallest $latex U^*$.

So how come that they are called germs?]]></description>
