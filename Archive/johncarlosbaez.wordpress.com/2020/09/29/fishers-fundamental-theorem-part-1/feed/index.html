They interview the author of his biography, so his story is available there in short form. In a sense, George&#039;s life played out as a metaphor of his own equation.]]></description>

Interesting!  I don&#039;t know anything about George Price except his paper on Fisher&#039;s fundamental theorem, which is really fun to read---first taking apart Fisher&#039;s three papers on this subject and then trying to figure out what Fisher must have meant.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Fisher&#039;s FTNS and G Price&#039;s later version (with interludes by Hamilton)  are central to the issue of &#039;group selection&#039; (GS)  --a sort of controversial topic since 1960&#039;s though i view it as &#039;resolved&#039; (i think a few outliers or &#039;hold outs&#039; such as S Pinker and J Coyne (and probably more--D Sperber...) still are against it (The 2 Wilson&#039;s--E O and DS --are on board DS always was and E O changed his opinion), but they both have GS theories which i don&#039;t really think even get &#039;price&#039;s equation&#039;.

Although i read as much of the literature on GS as i could --probably mostly in late 80&#039;s-90&#039;s--2000&#039;s ---Price equation was never mentioned until fairly recently.  I view Price equation as a generalization of Fisher&#039;s  FTNS  (its sort of like the difference between the continuous logisitic equation and its discrete version---both are correct as are Fisher and Price---but one has a stable equilbirium distirbution and the other is chaotic.  (I learned this in a paper by E Montroll.)

Price deals with &#039;extended or inclusive  fitness&#039; --Fisher deals with a more limited form (in fact i would say Fisher&#039;s theorem deals with &#039;haploids&#039; or &#039;clones&#039;.    The most fit clones survive.  (One can look at some influential papers in theoretical population genetics and they make this assumption for &#039;mathematical conveniance&#039; --ie they are studying th genetics of some mating (diploid, sexually reproducing )   species but for &#039;conveniance &#039; they assume its haploid (clones).  This way they only have to follow one gene&#039;s trajectory.  (In many cases it actually works---this approach is called Fisher&#039;s &#039;beanbag genetics&#039;).

(  Fisher dids deal with diploids (eg sex, epistasis, dominance)---under special cases (but  Fisher just linearizes out all interactions.
  i view this as conceptually similar to trying to model phase transitions in condensed matter physics by &#039;linearizing out the interactions&#039;    --eg they  say &#039;as a first approximation a crystal, or computer, is essentially an ideal gas&#039;.  It actually works in many cases.)

tThere is a famous paper by astrophysicist  Chandresekhar called &#039;stochastic problems in physics and astronomy&#039; in Rev Modern Physics in  1943--i just read the physics part.  its last section has an error in it ( on diffsuion in a potential) which confused me for a long time--until i read some article on WW saying it was an error. )

https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.1844  is one more paper---i think I agree with this paper although i think the authors also make the same &#039;mistake&#039; Fisher made --at least elsewhere ---they linearize out interactions and end up with &#039;beanbag genetics&#039;. In a sense one could interpret this as aiming to legitimize GWAS (and discount Landes LP-model --Landes of MIT sort of was one of creators of GWAS but he revised it the way Price revised Fisher--&#039;optimizers dont optimize everythijng&#039; though Fisher&#039;s theorem still hold--&#039;surivivors survive&#039;.I think this is analgous to Schrodinger&#039;s view in his book &#039;what is life&#039;---explains wave function collapse by saying most of the &#039;other states&#039; &#039;dissapear&#039; via Born&#039;s rule.   ) .

Those quotes from Price are amusing (since i&#039;m not sure ive ever seen his original paper ).  Alex Rosenburg (philosophy of science at Duke ) has a 2005 paper/exchange  i Philo and Biology called &#039;Mathen&#039;s and Ariew&#039;s Obituary for Fitness :reports of its  death has been greatly exaggerated&#039;.  (This is a sort of debate over whether Fiher&#039;s theorem is the same as 2nd la of thermodynamics or whether its a version of newton&#039;s law --a principlal of least action.   Confusion seems to be a trait that is selected for (maybe one could ave a ne law similar to MEP (max entropy proudction) like MCPP Max confusion production pcp  (tho the acronym and similar ones are  in use including this area---refers to a kind of &#039;boat&#039;-- a a large asian country).

Some apparent &#039;creationists&#039; have adopted price&#039;s theorem to make their point (i&#039;m not intelligent enough  to understand what the or their grand design is) see the book geneticentropy(dot)org --their view seems to be that while Fisher possibly had some similar views, if Price&#039;s revised argument  prevalied over Fisher then they will use Price.  This is analogous to some free market economists said if adam smith and arrow-hahn&#039;s  profoof that the &#039;free market&#039; needs some revisions due to chaos and computability theory, then they will use chaos and computability thoery to prove that free markets are still optimal or possible---ie &#039;this is the best of all possible worlds&#039;.

Price gave up theoretical biology, becamer a christian, and i hear worked serving the poor and died as  pauper (didnt get no royalties)..]]></description>
