Stay tuned and you&#039;ll see what I&#039;ll do.  I don&#039;t think it will look much like genetics---it&#039;ll probably look more like thermodynamics or information theory combined with network theory.  In other words: stuff I&#039;ve already studied and written about.]]></description>

Great.

Actually genetics and genomes &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; abstract. After all, they are coded versions of biochemical constructs, even if they express themselves biochemically:

The thing of it is I don&#039;t know how to do &lt;em&gt;diversity&lt;/em&gt; without addressing &lt;em&gt;fitness&lt;/em&gt;. A definition?

&lt;blockquote&gt;Fitness is the expected genetic contribution of an individual to future generations.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That&#039;s from Kokko (2007). And, to me, it kind of ties hands trying to address diversity without fitness, and, transitively, genetics.]]></description>

Thanks for the references!  I know I have a lot of reading to do.  I&#039;ve decided I&#039;ll blog about it as I go along.  There&#039;s a particular line of thought I&#039;m trying to clarify, and Ulanowicz&#039;s work seems helpful toward clarifying it, but I don&#039;t really buy his particular formulas for ascendancy and reserve.

I doubt I&#039;ll want to actually work on genetics and genomes.  Since I&#039;m a mathematician of a certain rather abstract ilk, I&#039;m aiming for something a bit more general, and simple.    But of course it&#039;s important for me to learn more about genetics, population biology, evolutionary biology and the like, because generalities not based on knowledge of specifics tend to go astray.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s surely worth exploring these ideas in a variety of ways. But it just makes sense to take into consideration work that&#039;s already been done and summarized.

In particular, in &lt;em&gt;theory-based ecology&lt;/em&gt; these measures are &lt;a href=&quot;http://tbe.elte.hu/index.php/proba/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;based upon a number of special cases&lt;/a&gt;. (See the section on &quot;Finiteness and Diversity&quot;.) These fit into a &lt;a href=&quot;http://tbe.elte.hu/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;much bigger framework&lt;/a&gt;, and &quot;diversity&quot; is addressed in terms of &lt;em&gt;genetic&lt;/em&gt; diversity, not numbers of individuals. There is also a notion that species come and go all the time, due to &lt;em&gt;genetic drift&lt;/em&gt;.

So reduction in genetic diversity is due to homogenization of populations, not primarily extinction rates. Clearly the latter can contribute to homogenization, but simply encouraging certain preferred species can do it, too, even if that &quot;encouragement&quot; is selection.

There are phenomena in genetic drift which can reduce diversity spontaneously, like &lt;em&gt;coalescence&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;genetic bottlenecks&lt;/em&gt;.

Many other scholars address this with mathematical theory, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_neutral_theory_of_biodiversity&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;including Hubbell&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Google Scholar&lt;/em&gt; gives 7900 citations to articles about that theory from 2015 to 2020 alone.

Other references include M.A.Nowak&#039;s &lt;em&gt;Evolutionary Dynamics&lt;/em&gt;  (2006) which is mathematical and uses diversity of genomes in SIV/HIV to explain an extreme benefit to that virus, and uses it to touch on cancer proliferation, something which &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-16065-8_1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Durrett has examined, too&lt;/a&gt;.

Finally, Kokko (2007, &lt;em&gt;Modelling for Field Biologists&lt;/em&gt;) recommends in her chapter 3:

D. A. Roff (1997), &lt;em&gt;Evolutionary Quantitative Genetics&lt;/em&gt;.

S. H. Rice (2004), &lt;em&gt;Evolutionary Theory: Mathematical and Conceptual Foundations&lt;/em&gt;.

R. McElreath and R. Boyd (2007), &lt;em&gt;Mathematical Models of Social Evolution: A Guide for the Perplexed&lt;/em&gt;.

as richer tutorials on modeling and understanding quantitative genetics. Check out her chapter, too, though.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know it is a little off-topic, but since you mentioned the interplay between mutual information and conditional entropy, it reminded me about a question about the combination of entropies, in particular using the property of strong additivity (I think also sometimes known under different names, glomming rule, chain rule,...). This includes, in the general case, several conditional entropies as summands, and it is related to the question if the subsystems, which these conditional entropies represent, and which have to be combined, are independent (simple additivity case) or not (strong additivity case). And I wonder, if this occurs in a classical thermodynamical context ever, since I always only have encountered it in the context of information theory works, where in classical thermodynamics entropies always just simply add?

Maybe more related to your posting, one could imagine the more general case with several conditional entropies taken to be into account. Would that mean ascendancy (mutual information) has to be always a unique, single quantifier, while reserve capacities (conditional entropies) could be split into, in fact, arbitrary number of cases (but according to which classification)? Would that make sense?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Someone i knew once loaned me this book by Ulanowicz which had all these formulas--i think they are likely or somewhat correct but i found his presentation in that book &#039;nonoptimal&#039;.

He was quite popular in some theoretical biology circles.  Note the 2nd author in the cited paper --B Lietaer  https://sustainable-world.ch

he&#039;s sort of famous in economics.

(the person i knew also was into Lietaer --and was into a UBI in part --universal basic income.  Many people are as well but his view of UBI  was it all was  the same .

He ran a group house in which everyone had the same income (most of which was paid for by the &#039;state&#039; or govt--most people&#039;s incomes were forms of welfare, disability, etc.While the person who promoted the equal incomes sort of operated that way, he was also appointed as the &#039;executor&#039;  and hence determined who could get acess to their equal income.
 -.
   (Richard Levins formerly of Harvard  had a slightly different analyses of bio and other diversity. biologicaldiversity.org or https:.//biologicaldiversity.org

I also sort of use the &#039;reserve&#039; and &#039;ascendency&#039; concepts (as noted some sort of scientific/mathematical/rigorous characterization of these might be difficult and contentious--who in their right mind would use their reserves to attempt to climb mount improbable? 
   as a side note there is a major metropolis or some say  town called Reserve, New Mexico --last of the wild wild west. )

I got a nice note from my bank account today that my reserves (which i am saving for retirement) are now -44$.   My ascendency might be whatever bills i have paid, and any other &#039;capital&#039; (social, human or otherwise)  i have accumulated.

&#039;we are walking on the streets of chance, where the chances are always next to none, and the intentions unjust&#039;  (iggy pop, the song &#039;baby&#039; on the album idiot, produced by david bowie).]]></description>
