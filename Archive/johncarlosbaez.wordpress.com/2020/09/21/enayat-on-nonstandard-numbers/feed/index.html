					<description><![CDATA[Over on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2020/03/25/category-theory-community-server/&quot;&gt;Category Theory Community Server&lt;/a&gt;, Nikolaj Kuntner asked me why I was interested in nonstandard models of arithmetic.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  What&#039;s the quest?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I&#039;ll say this very vaguely, since you&#039;re wisely asking for a quest instead of a theorem.   (To understand what a mathematician is doing you need to know their quest, not their theorems.)

I think the concept of &quot;standard&quot; model of PA is circular in a subtle way.

Very &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; crudely, the standard natural numbers are 0, 1, 1+1, 1+1+1, ...  But what does the &quot;...&quot; mean?  It means that we keep on going.  But &lt;em&gt;how long&lt;/em&gt; do we keep on going?   What sort of expressions 1+...+1 count as natural numbers?   Only those where there&#039;s a &lt;em&gt;standard natural number&lt;/em&gt; of plus signs!

But this is circular.

There&#039;s a lot of evidence that every model of PA &quot;feels standard to itself&quot;, but I want to make this clearer.

To do this, I want a way to exhibit situations where I think I&#039;m dealing only with standard natural numbers, while &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; think some of my numbers are &lt;em&gt;nonstandard&lt;/em&gt;.   That is: I want a framework where in some context some model of PA counts as &quot;standard&quot;, but in some other context that model counts as &quot;nonstandard&quot;.]]></description>
