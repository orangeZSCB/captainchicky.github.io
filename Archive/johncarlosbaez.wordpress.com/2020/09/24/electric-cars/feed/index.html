&lt;i&gt;&quot;My next car will probably be electric. &quot;&lt;/i&gt;

I usually think about a week for each 1000 of the price of something I buy, so I was aiming to by an electric car about a year from now.  Alas, my old car gave out and it wasn&#039;t worth investing any more in it, so I had to make a quick decision.  I got the 3000 incentive from Tesla and 6000 from the government and more than 1000 because sales tax was reduced by 2 per cent due to the pandemic then 3000 discount from Tesla since I bought a slightly older (but better!!!) model.  I don&#039;t regret it.  I can&#039;t (yet) charge at home, but there are superchargers not far away, and at IKEA I can charge (but more slowly) for free.  I think that there are other free locations to charge.  With the supercharger, it&#039;s fast enough so that one can drive there just to charge if necessary (of course, ideal would be on the way home after a long trip); the others would take too long, but if I am there anyway, I can charge up a bit for free.

It&#039;s the standard range plus RWD, the cheapest model in Europe.  The newer facelift models are from the States, but the older ones are from China and have better batteries.  Also, the consensus is that the production quality in China is much better (times have changed).

There is no reason not to order it via the internet.  Feel free to use my referral link and get us both some free supercharging!

Yes, the wrong spelling of my name is correct in this case.

As far as I know, there is no limit to the number of orders which can be made via the link above.

Another thing I like about Tesla: there is no &quot;list price&quot; and &quot;street price&quot;, and hence no haggling.]]></description>

I mean solar, wind, tidal, etc., but not nuclear here.

As to the backing up (i.e. having enough reserves for times when the wind is not blowing), that is less and less of an issue the more renewable energy there is.  Also, even if there is backup, that doesn&#039;t mean that the backup is running (literally) at full steam all the time.]]></description>

By renewable, you mean hydro-electric or nuclear? both solar and wind-power in most cases require to be backed up by reliable energy production (e.g., in Germany, they mostly went with coal in recent years). Solar and wind are dependent on the weather, the seasons (e.g. longer nights in the winter when you need more electricity usually).]]></description>

I suggested tramways: they are much cheaper to set-up than subways. Electric trams used to be found in many (hundreds of) North American cities (Canada included). The infrastructure was mostly dismantled post WWII (you can look into how and why.. not pretty in many cases). It could be revived. Another advantage: it helps push cars and trucks out of the way (a bit) and regulate traffic.
About hydrogen: there is a significant (often hidden, not mentioned) cost: its production. It requires a lot of energy, usually provided by fossil fuel burning to provide the required heat. The snake bites its tail.
The other elephant in the room is: the most needed reduction of energy consumption. So, how to go about that? should that not guide our long term decisions? Again, in cities (including getting in and out from suburbia): what are the most efficient and clean means of transport? (the car is not the answer I suggest).]]></description>

If you read this article

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketplace.org/2019/04/11/subways-us-expensive-cost-comparison/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Why are subways in the U.S. so expensive?&lt;/a&gt;

you&#039;ll discover the final answer is that &lt;em&gt;nobody knows&lt;/em&gt; why U.S. subways are so much more expensive than subways in other countries---at least, nobody involved in writing the article.  A number of theories are proposed and argued about.  I don&#039;t think cutting through rock is harder in the U.S. than other countries.   It&#039;s possible better rock-cutting technology wouldn&#039;t significantly lower subway prices in the U.S.]]></description>

Philip Helbig, you can find a sortable table of all countries by renewable power on Wikipedia. Germany is roughly a quarter of the way down in percentage terms. Of course it is also important how the remaining proportion of energy is generated. For carbon footprint, nuclear is better than gas is is better than coal, so Germany&#039;s decision to move to coal while phasing out viable nuclear plants was frustrating. I appreciate that there are counter arguments and perhaps this is a little off-topic.]]></description>

Mr. Gibbs- Mr. Helbig lives apparently in Frankfurt at the river Main (there is also a Frankfurt at the river Oder, so you usually say Frankfurt/Main). I don&#039;t know Mr. Helbig. The Gigafactory is thought to be built in the greater outskirts of Berlin.

Mr. Helbig - the &quot;environmental protection&quot; area is actually right at river Spree (Berlin gets 70% of its water from rivers, since due to the wars the groundwater is polluted), it is not just some protection area but a Wasserschutzzone IIIA and by the chemicals that are handled there (over 244 tons of Wassergefährdungsklasse 2 and over 20 tons of Wassergefährdungsklasse 3) by AwSV §49  http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/awsv/AwSV.pdf the total &quot;Anlage&quot; is simply not allowed to be built there as these amounts of chemicals are twice Gefährdungsstufe D. So yesterday -after they were confronted with this fact- the Tesla guys tried to argue (seriously!) that this is not one &quot;Anlage&quot; but that there are many unique &quot;Anlagen&quot; in the factory, which are in particular not &quot;Teilanlagen&quot; of a big &quot;Anlage&quot;. Like one tank should already be seen as a separate &quot;Anlage&quot; according to Tesla. So they argue that there are many unique little Anlagen in the factory- each with tiny amounts of chemicals and so there is no problem. And this was seen as such also by the representative of &quot;Untere Wasserschutzbehörde&quot;. I am at a loss for words and outraged.]]></description>
