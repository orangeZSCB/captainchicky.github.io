I don&#039;t think so.  The theoretical side of Hawking and Penrose has been around for a long time, so they could have received a joint prize earlier.  I think that the experimentally confirmed aspect is important, and the observers who got half the prize played a major role in that.  So, the time wasn&#039;t really ripe until after Hawking had died.]]></description>

Apparently, one reason Einstein did not get the Nobel prize for general relativity was because Gullstrand was on the Nobel committee. Gullstrand thought Einstein was wrong. Ironically, the Gullstrand Painleve coordinates that were intended to prove this, are now known to be an equivalent formulation of the Schwarzschild solution.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2020/10/08/roger-penroses-nobel-prize/#comment-166943&quot;&gt;Michael Weiss&lt;/a&gt;.

I know, Popper&#039;s star has faded. He&#039;s generally thought to have come second in the long-running debate with Kuhn. But Popper, to my mind, better captures the process of discovery. He offers the metaphor of a net: your hypothesis is a net which you cast into the future, to see what it will catch.

I love this and I think it&#039;s a model of problem-solving that is followed by people in many practical fields: plumbers, electricians, car mechanics. The vital point is to distinguish the hypothesis, or theory, from the discovery (or observation), which is a fact.

My original proposition, perhaps crudely advanced, was that &quot;proof&quot; needn&#039;t have the same meaning in science as in mathematics (or, say, law or history). The methods and criteria are different. I think it&#039;s fair to trace this error to Plato; call it over-reliance on verbal categories.

I don&#039;t fully subscribe to Hersh&#039;s attempt at a &#039;humanist&#039; compromise between Platonism and anti-Platonism. But his book at least has the merit of pointing up the contrast in an accessible way.

Quine (to oversimplify no doubt) took on board the 19th century elaboration of the real number line, and held that such a conception of number was indispensable to physics. Again, this seems to me a step too far.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2020/10/08/roger-penroses-nobel-prize/#comment-166907&quot;&gt;John Baez&lt;/a&gt;.

I also recommend this, which is short and free:

&#8226; Helge Kragh, &lt;a href=&quot;https://physicsworld.com/a/max-planck-the-reluctant-revolutionary/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Max Planck: the reluctant revolutionary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Physics World&lt;/i&gt;, 1 December 2000.

A quote about Planck&#039;s 1900 paper:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Quantum theory was born. Or was it? Surely Planck’s constant had appeared, with the same symbol and roughly the same value as used today. But the essence of quantum theory is energy quantization, and it is far from evident that this is what Planck had in mind. As he explained in a letter written in 1931, the introduction of energy quanta in 1900 was “a purely formal assumption and I really did not give it much thought except that no matter what the cost, I must bring about a positive result”. Planck did not emphasize the discrete nature of energy processes and was unconcerned with the detailed behaviour of his abstract oscillators. Far more interesting than the quantum discontinuity (whatever it meant) was the impressive accuracy of the new radiation law and the constants of nature that appeared in it.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If Planck did not introduce the hypothesis of energy quanta in 1900, who did? Lorentz and even Boltzmann have been mentioned as candidates, but a far stronger case can be made that it was Einstein who first recognized the essence of quantum theory. Einstein’s remarkable contributions to the early phase of quantum theory are well known and beyond dispute. Most famous is his 1905 theory of light quanta (or photons), but he also made important contributions in 1907 on the quantum theory of the specific heats of solids and in 1909 on energy fluctuations.

There is no doubt that the young Einstein saw deeper than Planck, and that Einstein alone recognized that the quantum discontinuity was an essential part of Planck’s theory of black-body radiation. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>
