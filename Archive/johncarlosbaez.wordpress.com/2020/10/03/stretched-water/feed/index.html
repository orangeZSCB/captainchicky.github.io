Yes, metastable sap in the xylem will not break in this sense in plants, but the threat is bubble nucleation or cavitation, triggered by gas bubbles in the sap, and which blocks transmission to the leaves. Trees have interesting ways of minimising the threat.]]></description>

Nice!  -13.1 megapascals in the California chaparral!   The &#039;liquid-vapor spinodal&#039; --- the negative pressure at which liquid water &#039;breaks&#039; --- looks to be between -120 and -200 megapascals at room temperature.  That&#039;s taken from Figure 1b here:

I was wrong to single out tall trees; certain plants of modest stature are even more impressive in terms of negative pressure. Recalling that positive atmospheric pressure is roughly 0.1MPa, I quote from a 2014 review paper by John Sperry:

&quot;Gravity actually exerts a relatively trivial influence on xylem [pressure]. ... [A]bout 1,000 kPa of pressure is required to move water from soil to leaves against friction, a value that does not appear to be markedly size-dependent. Overcoming friction and gravity requires a 10-m tall tree at mid-day to have a xylem pressure of about  ... -1.1 MPa. The other significant determinant of xylem pressure is the soil water potential. Because of the reverse osmosis at the root, the xylem must extract water not only from the soil pore space, but also against the osmotic strength of the soil solution. A 10 m mangrove rooted in seawater must pull against ca. -2.4 MPa of osmotic potential, which added to -1.1 for gravity and friction, comes to -3.5 MPa. In deserts, plants have to pull against soil water potentials of -5 MPa or lower. The lowest xylem pressure the author is aware of is -13.1 MPa (mean value) in a shrub from the California chaparral (Ceanothus cuneatus) during the dry season ...&quot;]]></description>

Hello, Harvey!  I hadn&#039;t thought about that.  What sort of negative pressures are typical in the sap of tall trees?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks John for this interesting post. Stretched water is ubiquitous in Nature, but hidden in tall trees and not fully appreciated until the end of the 19th century. The story is told in my ‘The theory of the rise of sap in trees; some historical and conceptual remarks’, Physics in Perspective, 15, 320-358 (2013); An updated version of this paper is at http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.3066.]]></description>

Water is a very unusual liquid - it breaks a lot of the usual rules.  Besides getting &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; dense as you cool it below 4 &#176; C and even &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; dense when it freezes, its viscosity &lt;em&gt;decreases&lt;/em&gt; at higher pressures.   It also has an unusually high specific heat, and an unusually high melting and boiling point compared to similar molecules.

Going up one row of the periodic table we have:

hydrogen telluride (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te) - melting point -49 &#176;C
hydrogen selenide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se) - melting point -64 &#176;C
hydrogen sulfide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) - melting point -84 &#176;C
water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) - melting point 0 &#176;C

Lighter molecules tend to have lower melting points... but water breaks this pattern!]]></description>

Maybe some people build software that goes around grabbing blog articles and translating them into other languages.  If a loop gets created, all hell would break loose as an article gets translated into mush.   But presumably such software gets aimed mainly at real blog articles, not translations.]]></description>
