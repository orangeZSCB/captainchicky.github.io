					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2020/10/19/epidemiological-modeling-with-structured-cospans/#comment-167128&quot;&gt;Young&lt;/a&gt;.

For actual neurobiology, try this:

&#8226; Kathryn Hess, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TyNInHXLcE&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Towards a categorical approach to neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;, ACT2018 talk.

I believe that Google&#039;s Tensorflow is connected to monoidal categories:

&#8226; John Baez, &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2016/06/05/programming-with-data-flow-graphs/&quot;&gt;Programming with data flow graphs&lt;/a&gt;, 5 June 2016.

but I haven&#039;t had time to sort this out in my mind.   (This is completely separate from whether there&#039;s a graphical interface to Tensorflow; apparently there was not when I posted that article.)

Another thing worth looking at is this:

&#8226; Brendan Fong, David I. Spivak and Rémy Tuyéras, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10455&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Backprop as functor: a compositional perspective on supervised learning&lt;/a&gt;.

There should be a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; more to say about applications of category theory to both neurobiology and artificial neural networks, but I haven&#039;t seen enough work on this.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Professor Baez,

Being no expert, I don&#039;t have a solid understanding of the Category theory. But I&#039;ve been having the impression that the Category theory as I understand it is about a mathematical formulation or framework of the networks and can in principle be applied to anything involving a network.

My interested subject of research and study has lately been related to (Biological or Artificial) Neural Network, or distributed learning in the view of Connectionism (I&#039;d say).

My question is, are you familiar with any research regarding Neural Networks where the idea or methods of Category Theory are used?
A paper I have found relevant in this line of research is:

The Representation Theory of Neural Networks
(https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.12213)
Marco Antonio Armenta, Pierre-Marc Jodoin

which used Quiver to formulate the network.

Anyhow, I admire your works and find them inspiring, although I have to learn more to fully appreciate them. Thank you for your contributions to community.]]></description>
