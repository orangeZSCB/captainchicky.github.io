					<description><![CDATA[No, Keith, you&#039;re not posting too much on this topic!   It&#039;s very interesting to me, and I don&#039;t have enough time to research it myself.  I sometimes get grumpy when people post comments about W, Y, and Z on an article about X, but you&#039;re not doing that.  At least in my mind, ITER is close enough to SPARC that anyone reading about SPARC would be interested in ITER&#039;s triumphs or difficulties.

So thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Am I am posting too much on this topic? 
If not, here is an article suggesting the ITER may have problems:

&quot;Potential design problems for ITER fusion device&quot;
2021-01-22
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-81510-2

&quot;A key obstacle to such design is the performance during abnormal events including plasma disruptions and so-called edge-localized modes (ELMs). In these events, a massive and sudden release of energy occurs quickly, due to loss of full or partial plasma confinement, leading to very high transient power loads on the reactor surface boundaries. A successful reactor design should tolerate several of these transient events without serious damages such as melting and vaporization of the structure. This paper highlights, through comprehensive state-of-the-art computer simulation of the entire ITER interior design during such transient events, e.g., ELMs occurring at normal operation and disruptions during abnormal operation, potential serious problems with current plasma facing components (PFCs) design.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Latest (2021-01-19) information on how they are modelling what will happen in ITER:
https://phys.org/news/2021-01-realistic-iter-tokamak-magnetic-fusion.html

&quot;To facilitate the design and operation of the ITER tokamak, scientists worldwide have been conducting what are known as nuclear analyses, which are aimed at theoretically examining its outcomes and potential.

So far, nuclear analyses based on data gathered by the ITER reactor have relied on detailed but partial models that only represent specific parts of the tokamak. 
...
&quot;Due to the computational limitations of a couple of decades ago, the ITER neutronics community worldwide, including ourselves (the TECF3IR research team at UNED), have so far been working using partial models of the ITER tokamak,&quot; Rafael Juarez, one of the researchers who carried out the study, told Phys.org. &quot;Since then, however, computer power has evolved significantly. Furthermore, in recent years, the computational codes that we use have undergone advances as well, some of them enabled by TECF3IR.&quot; &quot;]]></description>

Actually, I will add that nuclear power is hardly &#039;on-demand&#039; - it is always on unless you give it a few months notice to turn off, it&#039;s refueling (every few years), or if it malfunctions. In the UK the government had to pay wind farms to disconnect during the COVID19 lockdown as the energy supply was far higher than the demand (it fell ~10-20% if I remember correctly). Nuclear could not just switch off their generation at a short notice. Energy over-supply causes much the same issues as energy under-supply - frequency of the grid rises, generators can disconnect, currents can flow in the wrong directions.]]></description>

&#039;Intermittent&#039; is not the right word (albeit commonly used by parties with vested interests in fossil conventional generation) - it is preferable to call these variable resources. Nowadays it is commonly more difficult to predict the energy demand than the energy supply from a PV solar panel.

On the contrary, conventional generation such as CCGT / coal / nuclear power plants are intermittent in the sense that they can fail (and are indeed not generating about ~10% of the year due to maintenance / technical issues). Recent blackouts in California were blamed on the renewable supply - what should be noted is that California has overbuilt CCGT generation and much of the blackout was actually caused by two CCGT power stations turning off. PV rarely encounters technical issues that lead to sudden generation loss - the predictability of power from PV panels is actually astoundingly good. There are also renewable energy approaches that can store energy longer-term (thermal solar, hydro) - economics of these in the US are a different discussion.

In terms of supply-demand matching conventional generation can only react in a matter ~15 minutes to any supply shortage. Increase in electromobility will lead to advent of &#039;fast grid regulation&#039; whereas the charging cars can check the grid frequency as they are charging (in fact - they already do that) and if the frequency falls below 60Hz they can slow charging down / if the frequency rises above 60Hz they can preferably charge. Similarly, they can deploy energy to the grid at night when not in use. Incentive to do that is a matter of energy market regulation, but it is not particularly complicated. These systems also offer much faster frequency regulation (check virtual power stations) than other systems.

If we are discussing the economics aspect of this entire issue - I recommend you look at the &#039;2035 report&#039; published by Berkeley in June - it discusses an economically neutral pathway to 90% less CO2 emissions by 2035. Complete decarbonisation is quite possible by 2050.

I would be happy to discuss this further - but I am absolutely knackered after an infinitely long session at the APS-DPP conference. I also want to say that I am a big fan of your blog and found your discussion of Noether&#039;s theorem a few years back in London quite interesting.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  In terms of ancillary services such as grid balancing or voltage/frequency control these can be solved much more cheaply via grid integration and demand-side measures (ERCOT in Texas already has some interesting demand-side measures) – this is documented by the research into smarter regulation and introduction of smart meters.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

People who claim wind and solar aren&#039;t enough often say the intermittent nature of these power sources requires us to keep nuclear power or other &quot;on-demand&quot; sources of power.  Are you saying that can be minimized---or eliminated entirely?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am not familiar with the SPARC approach or the MCF side of the fusion research; however, direction of the energy sector is increasingly clear with the current rise of renewables (LCoE of PV and wind @ ~$20/MWh, with PV learning curve aiming for ~$10/MWh in 2030s). In fact, it is likely that any thermal cycle power plant will find it extremely hard (if not impossible) to compete with renewables based on the capital expenditures on the turbine side itself with zero capital spent on the steam production side.

I always got a kick out of the Enterprise using &quot;EPS&quot; conduits, which are plasma pipes, for electrical wiring. But I guess if you&#039;re going to convert small groups of entire humans from matter into energy (and back again somewhere else), you probably &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; need the current carrying capacity of something like a plasma conduit, &#039;cause that&#039;s a lot of energy.]]></description>
