Under the technology adoption lifecycle, &quot;out of the box&quot; happens after a lot of task sublimation happens. We are talking late mainstreet phase, which is on the other side of the mean. We are talking a discontinuous innovation here. There is much that has to happen before &quot;out of the box&quot; will be the reality. Rushing the process leaves money on the table.

Right now, AI people want &quot;out of the box.&quot; But, that ignores the money involved.

We will get there. Trust the process.]]></description>

Yes, you have the right idea. The opposite of showing that something is socially infeasible is designing mechanism that make it feasible

The kind of thing I could daydream about is building models that convince people that climate action is not possible without certain regulation, for example.]]></description>

The answer to the first question is both. It&#039;s a new mathematical approach (the first paper is https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04641), and also separately a software tool implementing the theory (which is important because it turns out in practice to be very impractical to use it without software support)

I&#039;m just seeing distribution-valued solution concepts for the first time so the answer is no &quot;out of the box&quot;, but I&#039;ll make a wild guess that it&#039;s possible after doing a bit of theory. I&#039;m going to show this paper to some people]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Jules,

I think of a game as a &#039;place&#039; being a possibility, a fact being a &#039;token&#039; put inside a place, and an event being a &#039;transition&#039; in an &#039;object-oriented petri net.&#039; How I implemented that years ago was using classes in Smalltalk. (I wrote this up in a paper for Summer Simulation and can send you that paper, if you&#039;re interested. Just let me know.) I put instances of each of those-- possibility, event, fact--  on a multi-threaded queue organized by time, with semaphores and other gadgets as supplied in the parallel processing classes (used in the Model-View-Controller interface) in the Smalltalk &#039;operating system.&#039;

To do that, I bought a bunch of classes for drawing lines, arrows, rectangles etc. And then &#039;inherited&#039; that code into my own methods, so when I drew any of of the three and connected them with arrows, the drawing would automatically write appropriate methods. When the &#039;time&#039; came, those methods would place whatever I had drawn-- e.g. possibility or event-- onto the time queue. As the simulation proceded, these methods would look at the incoming and outgoing arrows I had drawn to pull tokens and other objects, like Petri net transitions, onto the time queue.

But when Petri net transitions where pulled onto the queue, I immediately found out that they would pull tokens into an incoming place and onto the time queue as fast as the system could process them. The simulation crashed. So for this kind of transition, I had to draw in a &#039;self loop,&#039; which was just an arrow from a transition (an event) to a place (a possibility), and an arrow from that place back into the transition. It was like something I think Einstein once said-- &#039;Time exists so everything doesn&#039;t happen at once.&#039; As a result, there could be only one method at a time for that event on the time queue. No copy of that method could be placed on the queue-- until the &#039;fact&#039; existed that the transition (event) had completed. So there could be only one copy of the method performing at a time-- not the unlimited number that originally were pulled onto the queue, which caused the system to crash.

The purpose of this simulation was to model a multi-million dollar automated manufacturing system. We wanted to see it simulated before we spent the money.

The context for this industrial research is here:

https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08956308.1996.11671042

(You can see how it relates to the equation for the probability learning game that I posted in a comment on John&#039;s post about the Fisher theorem.)]]></description>

Apart from my problems with category theory per se - I think that the means of automated social modelling are at least up to now rather limited -even for small game theory applications. So you know probably that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_goods_game&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;public goods game&lt;/a&gt; displays in experiments that the participants show &quot;irrational&quot; behaviour (which I -by the way- would call rather &quot;rational&quot; behaviour). That is Wikipedia writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;..if the experiment were a purely analytical exercise in game theory it would resolve to zero contributions because any rational agent does best contributing zero, regardless of whatever anyone else does. This only holds if the multiplication factor is less than the number of players, otherwise the Nash equilibrium is for all players to contribute all of their tokens to the public pool.[1]. In fact, the Nash equilibrium is rarely seen in experiments; people do tend to add something into the pot. The actual levels of contribution found varies widely (anywhere from 0% to 100% of initial endowment can be chipped in).[2] The average contribution typically depends on the multiplication factor.[3] &lt;/blockquote&gt;

So I wonder a bit how you model &quot;social feasibility&quot; and whats really meant by that. Is it defined by whether things can be pushed through without riots? There were no riots at the Tesla factory (see comment below) but only more or less loud protests at the hearing and not very big demonstrations- so my question: does the &quot;small  protest&quot; make the Tesla factory socially feasible for you?]]></description>

By the way it is also H2O that gets &quot;poisoned&quot;. And this happens not only in case of an accident like for example if one &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2020/09/24/electric-cars/#comment-166644&quot;&gt;builds a highly chemical factory into a water preservation area&lt;/a&gt; but also by spilling it&#039;s waste water into a public waster water net that has a waste water treatment plant which has not the means to filter out all the wicked chemicals that are spilled into it so that the stuff ends up in nature. And Tesla knows of course about this while babbling about &quot;sustainability&quot;.]]></description>

  I would like to start a conversation about “using my powers for good”.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Great!  By the way, I hope you point out this discussion to people on Twitter.  If I were still on Twitter I&#039;d advertise it there.  It&#039;ll take some work finding the right people for this project, but they are out there somewhere.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  The kind of thing I’m imagining (possibly completely wrongly) is to create models that will suggest when a technically-feasible solution is not socially feasible.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

How about suggesting when it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; socially feasible?

Could you please daydream a bit about what you&#039;re imagining?

I&#039;ll try it just to get the ball rolling.  Maybe there are economists working on models of new regulations or carbon taxes or tax credits for new technologies or ... something like that... and they&#039;re modeling them using &quot;Bayesian games, which are finite-horizon, have common knowledge priors, and private knowledge with agents who do Bayesian updating&quot;.    The simulations they&#039;re doing are getting awkward, and they&#039;d be helped by your software (along with training from you).   Something like that?]]></description>
