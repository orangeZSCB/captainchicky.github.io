					<description><![CDATA[I would suggest looking into Ramsey discounting (see, e.g., https://www.nap.edu/read/24651/chapter/9), which has more basis in theory: e.g., that the social discount rate at any time should be a combination of a pure rate of time preference (sometimes estimated as the potential in any given year for civilization-ending disaster) plus  the economic growth rate times the elasticity of marginal utility of consumption (e.g. the idea that a richer society cares less about an additional dollar). And then, because the economic growth rate is uncertain, using a net present value approach leads to effective discount rate that declines over time.]]></description>

Jan, Excellent paper. Hyperbolic has to act as a survival function or cumulative as the probability density function will not integrate to unity. So the equivalent PDF for hyperbolic is the inverse squared k/(1+kt)^2]]></description>

I &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; the connection between this hyperbolic discounting and survival analysis made in the cited paper by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1689473/pdf/T9KA20YDP8PB1QP4_265_2015.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Sozou&lt;/a&gt; (2015), including that the $latex \text{HyperbolicDiscount}(t)$ is a &lt;em&gt;survival function&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Why&lt;/em&gt; should there be constant hazard?

In general Sozou argues that the survival function corresponding to a continuous probability density function in the hazard rate $latex f(k)$ is given by the Laplace transform of that $latex f(k)$.

Sozou goes on to show that the prior on $latex k$ corresponding to hyperbolic discounting is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;exponential prior&lt;/a&gt;.

With his (17), Sozou gives a striking survival function in the case of a uniform prior, one which is very specific.

I fell into Sozou because to John&#039;s question, I immediate began thinking about what the posterior would be on discounts if there was a prior or some other weighting on the discount rate. And, then, I discovered Sozou did it already.]]></description>

By the same token, it may also make a big difference depending on whether you have any fees due or not, or whether you have any other expected income or not.
If you know you&#039;re about to get your paycheck and that&#039;ll last you a while, it may well be the case that you feel like risking some extra time for potentially more reward.
But if you are risking dangerous levels of debt, and all the negative consequences that may come with, and that deadline is earlier than the expected payout of the larger reward, having more money right this instant is suddenly gonna be quite a bit more important. Especially if the lower reward is already enough to at least prevent/pay off that debt.]]></description>

People can value their fortunes outlasting them.  I see no contradiction.  People can experience present-day value for the present-day confidence that their fortunes will outlast them, or that their loved ones will inherit as much money as possible, but the value of those fortunes is zero to the ones who are dead.  That is,
V(today, after I&#039;m dead) &#062; 0, but 
V(after I&#039;m dead, after I&#039;m dead) = 0.
The only wiggle room I will grant is if you believe in an afterlife where things of value there are tied to how you handle things of value in life.

The above is only related to the value to the individual.  We are part of a social fabric, so people are motivated by social value as well as individual value.  The value to a society of a fortune will persist as long as that fortune and society persist, but ultimately social value will face the same fate as individual value: the social value of a dollar is zero to a society that is dead.

And regarding scale, I think it would be interesting to do a follow-up of the Ainslie experiment, where the amounts of money involved are not all small.]]></description>

&quot;The fact that our lifespans are not infinite in duration makes it difficult to accept any set of assumptions that lead to a dollar having nonzero value to a person after their death.&quot;

I think it&#039;s very, very weird to posit that people not value their fortunes outlasting them. Why do they e.g. go to so much effort to minimize transfer taxes?

As for the scale affecting things, the Ainslie experiment was about fairly small amounts of money, either now or in the future.]]></description>

Sorry for quoting you out of context, but it seemed worth getting people to hear this.  I think a lot of economics is based on this scalar notion of value (&quot;utility&quot;), so it&#039;s worth seeing what one can do in this framework, even though I&#039;m very skeptical of it.]]></description>
