					<description><![CDATA[Stupid question that is bugging... why isn&#039;t the kissing number in 8 dimensions 1136?

16 from plus/minus 1 in all 8 dimensions

Then, 1/2 in any 4 of the dimensions, combination of (8,4) = 70, and the 1/2 choice in any of the 4 dimensions could be plus or minus so for each combination of the 70 there is 16 possibles ones.
Ex: (0, 1/2, 1/2, 0, 1/2, 0, 0, 1/2) or (0, -1/2, 1/2, 0, 1/2, 0, 0, 1/2) or (1/2, 1/2, -1/2, 1/2, 0, 0, 0, 0), etc...

Total: 16 + 70(16) = 1136

All of these points are distance 1 away from origin and distance 1 or more away from each other

Thanks for any insight to error in thought or what is not be considered here.]]></description>

The lattice $latex {\bf Z}^5 \subset {\bf R}^5$ has 5-fold symmetry from the cyclic permutation of the standard basis of $latex {\bf R}^5$.  The permutation action is the direct sum of its action on $latex {\rm span}\{(1,1,1,1,1)\}$ and its orthogonal complement $latex V={\rm span}\{(1,1,1,1,1)\}^{\perp}$.  The intersection of a two dimensional subspace of $latex V$ with the Voronoi cells of the lattice $latex {\bf Z}^5 \; \cap \; V$ gives a quasiperiodic tiling of the plane with 5-fold symmetry.  This can be generalized to give quasiperiodic tilings of the plane with $latex n$-fold symmetry.  I think these pictures from the web may be examples:

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2020/03/20/from-the-octahedron-to-e8/#comment-160226&quot;&gt;Theo Johnson-Freyd&lt;/a&gt;.

Actually, I take it back: the Conway--Sloane construction of E8 from the icosians &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; interesting, because it&#039;s a special case of a systematic procedure relating the noncrystallographic Coxeter groups H2 H3 and H4 to Dynkin diagrams with twice as many dots in them, namely A4, D6 and E8.

I explained this back in &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week270.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;week270&lt;/a&gt;:

If you look at my slides you&#039;ll also see an appendix that describes two ways to get the E8 lattice starting from the dodecahedron.   This is a  nice interaction between the magic powers of the number 5 and those of  the number 8.  After my talk, Christian Korff from the University of Glasgow showed me a paper that fits this relation into a bigger pattern:

7) Andreas Fring and Christian Korff, Non-crystallographic reduction of Calogero-Moser models, Jour. Phys. A 39 (2006), 1115-1131.   Also  available as &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0509152&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;arXiv:hep-th/0509152&lt;/a&gt;.

They set up a nice correspondence between some non-crystallographic Coxeter groups and some crystallographic ones:

the H2 Coxeter group and the A4 Coxeter group,
the H3 Coxeter group and the D6 Coxeter group,
the H4 Coxeter group and the E8 Coxeter group.

A Coxeter group is a finite group of linear transformations of Rn that&#039;s generated by reflections.  We say such a group is &#034;non-crystallographic&#034; if it&#039;s not the symmetries of any lattice.  The ones listed above are closely tied to the number 5:

H2 is the symmetry group of a regular &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;pentagon&lt;/a&gt;.
H3 is the symmetry group of a regular &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodecahedron&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;dodecahedron&lt;/a&gt;.
H4 is the symmetry group of a regular &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/120-cell&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;120-cell&lt;/a&gt;.

Note these live in 2d, 3d and 4d space.  Only in these dimensions are there regular polytopes with 5-fold rotational symmetry!  Their  symmetry groups are non-crystallographic, because no lattice can have 5-fold rotational symmetry.

A Coxeter group is &#034;crystallographic&#034;, or a &#034;Weyl group&#034;, if it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; symmetries of a lattice.  In particular:

A4 is the symmetry group of a 4-dimensional lattice.
D6 is the symmetry group of a 6-dimensional lattice.
E8 is the symmetry group of an 8-dimensional lattice.

You can see precise descriptions of these lattices in &#034;&lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week65.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;week65&lt;/a&gt;&#034; - they&#039;re pretty simple.

Both crystallographic and noncrystallographic Coxeter groups are described by Coxeter diagrams, as explained back in &#034;&lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week62.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;week62&lt;/a&gt;&#034;.  The H2, H3 and H4 Coxeter diagrams look like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
   5
o---o

   5
o---o---o

   5
o---o---o---o
&lt;/pre&gt;

The A4, D6 and E8 Coxeter diagrams (usually called Dynkin diagrams) have twice as many dots as their smaller partners H2, H3 and H4.   In every case, each dot in the diagram corresponds to one of the reflections that generates the Coxeter group.  The edges in the diagram describe relations - you can read how in &#034;&lt;a href=&quot;week62.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;week62&lt;/a&gt;&#034;.

All this is well-known stuff.  But Fring and Korff investigated something more esoteric.  Each dot in the big diagram corresponds to 2 dots in its smaller partner.  And if we map each generator of the smaller group to the product of the two corresponding generators in the bigger one, we get a group homomorphism.

In fact, we get an &lt;i&gt;inclusion&lt;/i&gt; of the smaller group in the bigger one!

This is just the starting point of Fring and Korff&#039;s work.  Their real goal is to show how certain exactly solvable physics problems associated to crystallographic Coxeter groups can be generalized to these three noncrystallographic ones.  For this, they must develop more detailed connections than those I&#039;ve described.  But I&#039;m already happy just pondering this small piece of their paper.

For example, what does the inclusion of H2 in A4 really look like?

It&#039;s actually quite beautiful.  H2 is the symmetry group of a regular pentagon, including rotations and reflections.  A4 happens to be the symmetry group of a 4-simplex.  If you draw a 4-simplex in the plane, it looks like a pentagram.   So, any symmetry of the  pentagon gives a symmetry of the 4-simplex.  So, we get an inclusion of H2 in A4.

People often say that Penrose tilings arise from lattices in 4d space.   Maybe I&#039;m finally starting to understand how!  The A4 lattice has a  bunch of 4-simplices in it - but when we project these onto the plane  correctly, they give pentagrams.   I&#039;d be very happy if this were the key.

What about the inclusion of H3 in D6?

Here James Dolan helped me make a guess.  H3 is the symmetry group of a regular dodecahedron, including rotations and reflections.  D6 consists of all linear transformations of R6 generated by permuting the 6 coordinate axes and switching the signs of an even number of coordinates.  But a dodecahedron has 6 &#034;axes&#034; going between opposite pentagons!  If we arbitrarily orient all these axes, I believe any rotation or reflection of the dodecahedron gives an element of D6.  So, we get an inclusion of H3 in D6.

And finally, what about the inclusion of H4 in E8?

H4 is the symmetry group of the 120-cell, including rotations and reflections.  In 8 dimensions, you can get 240 equal-sized balls to touch a central ball of the same size. E8 acts as symmetries of this arrangement.  There&#039;s a clever trick for grouping the 240 balls into 120 ordered pairs, which is explained by Fring and Korff and also by Conway&#039;s &#034;icosian&#034; construction of E8 described at the end of my talk on the number 8.  Each element of H4 gives a permutation of the 120 faces of the 120-cell - and thanks to that clever trick, this gives a permutation of the 240 balls.  This permutation actually comes from an element of E8.  So, we get an inclusion of H4 in E8.]]></description>

<p>H4 is the symmetry group of the 120-cell, including rotations and reflections.  In 8 dimensions, you can get 240 equal-sized balls to touch a central ball of the same size. E8 acts as symmetries of this arrangement.  There&#8217;s a clever trick for grouping the 240 balls into 120 ordered pairs, which is explained by Fring and Korff and also by Conway&#8217;s &quot;icosian&quot; construction of E8 described at the end of my talk on the number 8.  Each element of H4 gives a permutation of the 120 faces of the 120-cell &#8211; and thanks to that clever trick, this gives a permutation of the 240 balls.  This permutation actually comes from an element of E8.  So, we get an inclusion of H4 in E8.</p>

Okay, I fixed the article.  I feel like explaining my mistakes in detail, to justify my foolishness, but I&#039;ll just say that I thought Harden&#039;s inner product was more like Conway and Sloane&#039;s than it really is, and if it had been what I thought it was, the determinant of the matrix of components of the vectors $latex v_i$ would be 1 (or -1) iff the determinant of the Gram matrix $latex \langle v_i, v_j \rangle$ was 1.]]></description>

You&#039;re right.  The binary tetrahedral group gives the first 24-cell I mentioned above, with vertices

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
$latex   \pm 1, \pm i , \pm j , \pm k $
&lt;/div&gt;

and

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
$latex  \displaystyle{ \frac{\pm 1 \pm i \pm j \pm k}{2} } $
&lt;/div&gt;

So the integral linear combinations of these give a lattice in the quaternions, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurwitz_quaternion&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Hurwitz integral quaternions&lt;/a&gt;.  This is also a subring of the quaternions: Harden points out that Wilson calls it the &#039;tetrian ring&#039;.   In this case we can&#039;t pull the dimension-doubling trick that we can with the octian ring or the icosian ring!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2020/03/20/from-the-octahedron-to-e8/#comment-160226&quot;&gt;Theo Johnson-Freyd&lt;/a&gt;.

I don&#039;t know what&#039;s good about these norms.  $latex \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]$ and $latex \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{5}]$ have &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_integer&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;completely multiplicative norms&lt;/a&gt;, but in a different sense of &#039;norm&#039;---and worse, those norms aren&#039;t closely related to the ones I&#039;m using here.

So, I wouldn&#039;t try to convince a skeptic like you that these constructions of the E8 lattice are interesting.  But Conway and Sloane found the icosahedral example interesting enough to write about, and it seems worth noting that the most straightforward way of adapting it to the octahedron works just as well.

In my paper &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2017/12/10/from-the-icosahedron-to-e8/&quot;&gt;From the icosahedron to E8&lt;/a&gt; I described two ways to construct the E8 lattice from the icosahedron: the one here, and another connected to the McKay correspondence and du Val’s work on the resolution of Kleinian singularities.  I think I could convince you that the latter is interesting.  I posed as a puzzle to find a connection between the two constructions.  Perhaps a good solution to that puzzle would count as a proof that the construction here is also interesting.

By the way, to get LaTeX to work here you have to follow the instructions that appear in boldface right above the box where you enter your comment.  I fixed your LaTeX.]]></description>
