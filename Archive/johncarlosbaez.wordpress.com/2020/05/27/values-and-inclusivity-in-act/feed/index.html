					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve researched into this, and nearly all the factors that cause this ostensible racial inequality (in shootings, stem participation, etc.) can mostly be imputed to the wealth difference between white and black Americans.

					<description><![CDATA[While I share Blake&#039;s concern that it would be bad for the entire academic world to depend on Zoom alone, I don&#039;t think that&#039;s happened yet.

At least, it hasn&#039;t happened in my part of the academic world. Since the pandemic started, I&#039;ve done video calls on (1) Zoom, (2) Skype, (3) Jitsi, (4) Teams, (5) Blackboard Collaborate, (6) Google Hangouts, (7) some other Google product whose name I can&#039;t remember right now, and (8) Whatsapp.  I&#039;ve also had text chats on most of those platforms, plus also (9) Slack, (10) Zulip, and (11) I think some other thing that I&#039;ve now forgotten too.

Moreover, from where I am (and I&#039;m sure people&#039;s mileages vary), Zoom hasn&#039;t won the battle for dominance since the pandemic started. I guess it&#039;s hugely increased its market share, but the people I know are still setting up calls on almost all the platforms above. And Blake, it may encourage you to know that unlike some universities, Edinburgh refuses to buy a Zoom subscription because of Zoom&#039;s poor security and privacy practices.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Zoom demanded a software upgrade before I could join the meeting.

This, of course, prompted a wave of petty irritation on my part &mdash; why can&#8217;t people get <i>critical infrastructure software</i> correct on the first go? &mdash; which I am riding into a more serious concern about the entire academic world centralizing upon a single mediocre product.
