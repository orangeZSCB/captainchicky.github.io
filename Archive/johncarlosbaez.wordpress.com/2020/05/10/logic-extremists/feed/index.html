@Carl :  I&#039;m generally pro-Parliament in the English Civil War, and I don‚Äôt object to what Cromwell wrote in that letter to the Covenanters, but his actions in Ireland qualify as terror in my opinion.  (I&#039;m similarly generally pro-Jacobin in the French Revolution, but the word ‚Äòterrorism‚Äô was invented, by them, to describe some of their actions.)  It&amp;apos;s possible to do great evil even after winning a fight against another evil.]]></description>

Cromwell was far from being a terrorist in this instance. He was the voice of liberty (in a limited form, I concede, but this was the 17th century, and even now...) against the autocratic rule based on some supposedly &quot;divine right&quot; that run in a family.]]></description>

Yes, he was beseeching others (Scottish Puritans who had just switched sides and made an alliance with the exiled King); and I&#039;m pretty sure that he would never have said it if they&amp;apos;d still agreed with him!]]></description>

Yes --- Jaynes was the guy who came up with max-ent methods in statistics in 1957, and one of his favorite problems was something like guessing the probability that you&#039;ll roll a 6 on a die if the mean value of this die&#039;s rolls is 4.   Check this out if you&#039;re not already familiar with him:

MaxEnt works well for many probability density functions. The approach is that it characterizes based only on the limited information available, so first assuming the mean only, then the mean and variance, etc.

Is that the MO of the Jaynesian-Bayesians as well?]]></description>

Yeah, I don&#039;t know much about Cromwell, but I was surprised that he was the one saying this, not having it said to him.  (Maybe he was beseeching &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; people to realize &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; could be wrong.)]]></description>
