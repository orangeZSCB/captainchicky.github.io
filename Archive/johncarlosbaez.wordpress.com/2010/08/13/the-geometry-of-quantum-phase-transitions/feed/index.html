Good morning,

  It is not in the archive. This Chapter is a review of several papers written on the geometry of quantum phase transitions. Most of those original papers are in the archive. 
I can send you a pdf of the Chapter if you send me your email to ortizg@indiana.edu]]></description>

Thanks very much!  Of course arXiv papers are infinitely more useful than book chapters.  Books are expensive and hard to find.  arXiv papers are free and instantly available anywhere with internet access.  Is this chapter on the arXiv?]]></description>

Sorry guys, I&#039;m new to wordpress. There are a couple of typos in the post above. The formula for the scalar product is actually 
$$!\left&#124;\langle\psi\left(x\right)&#124;\psi\left(x+\delta x\right)\rangle\right&#124;=1-const.\delta x^{2}L^{2(d+z-\Delta)}+O\left(\delta x^{3}\right)$$.

The formula is valid in the quasi-critical region, i.e. close to the critical point when the size of the system is (much) *shorter* than the correlation length ( [latex] L\ll\xi [/latex] ).]]></description>

Thanks, Lorenzo!  I clearly need to learn more condensed matter physics.  I didn&#039;t know about these smooth but nonanalytic phase transitions!]]></description>

Yes John (and Tim),

Non-analytic but C&lt;sup&gt;&#8734;&lt;/sup&gt; phase transitions are possible and indeed even quite common to a certain degree (in 1-dimensional zero temperature quantum mechanics). The kind of transitions I am talking about is the Berezinskii–Kosterlitz–Thouless (BKT) transition. It takes place for instance in the 1D Hubbard model at U=0 or in the XXZ Heisenberg model at &#948;=1. For instance, for the Hubbard model the exact form of the energy density is known and it is indeed a non-analytic function: its Taylor expansion at U=0 does not converge, but the function is smooth at any order. Not surprisingly the asymptotic expansion (i.e. the not converging formal Tayolor expansion at U=0) of the energy coincides with the one obtained by perturbation theory.]]></description>

I don&#039;t know if Gevrey classes are relevant here... I&#039;d never heard of them.

By the way, I&#039;m not fond of fake email addresses.  I don&#039;t think they&#039;re necessary: I&#039;m pretty sure the only person who can see them is me, and I&#039;d only send you email for a darn good reason.  (I don&#039;t sell Viagra, for example.)   But in the future, if you want to use a fake email address when posting here, please don&#039;t use &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; email address.  For some reason it makes my picture show up next to your comment, even though you listed your name as &quot;tice&quot;.   

So, I changed your email address to &quot;tice@math.ucr.edu&quot;.  If you use this in the future, the same little picture, or &quot;gravatar&quot;, will appear by your comments.]]></description>

In practice, expectation values of most observables in statistical mechanics tend to be real-analytic functions except at certain points where they blow up, or have a jump discontinuity, or their nth derivative fails to be continuous for some n.  Any of these &#039;bad points&#039; gets called a phase transition.

It&#039;s mathematically possible for the expectation value of some observable to depend smoothly but non-analytically on some parameters, and I bet one could even dream up physical systems where this happens, but I&#039;ve never actually seen people talk about them.  

Anyway, I think that of the two quotes you showed me, the second one is mathematically more precise.  I don&#039;t know what &#039;degree of non-analyticity&#039; means, except in a handwavy way where it just means &#039;how bad a function is at some point&#039;.  

I will fix it.]]></description>
