					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/08/24/probability-puzzles-from-egan/#comment-736&quot;&gt;John Baez&lt;/a&gt;.

The probability is ever so slightly less than 1/2.  The reason that it&#039;s less is because it is possible (albeit extremely unlikely) that her other child is &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; a boy named Thor, well-known among mountaineers, who was born under the same conditions as Thor, whose birth was also photographed by Anna&#039;s husband, with that picture also in Anna&#039;s book.  You get exactly 1/2 if you mistakenly double-count that circumstance.

That said, if you computed the probability that a random boy has these properties and used it in the calculation in the same way that you use 1/7 to calculate 13/27 in the Tuesday problem, then you&#039;d still get the wrong answer, because you&#039;d be treating the two children as independent when they&#039;re not.  I&#039;m not sure offhand whether this wrong answer is too small or too large, because on the one hand, Anna&#039;s other child is less likely to be named Thor then you would naively expect, since Anna has another child of that name, but on the other hand, a second child is more likely to be born under such conditions, given that Anna is a mountaineer, even known to climb while pregnant (although not &lt;em&gt;as much&lt;/em&gt; more likely then you would naively expect given that information about Anna, since she won&#039;t be as eager to get the rare photograph a second time).  However, taking this into account is like taking into account that more than 1/2 of all children are boys or that more than 1/7 of all children are born on Tuesdays.  It&#039;s more in the spirit of the original puzzle to run the numbers on each individual fact given about Thor (starting with his name), treat the two children as independent, and use that in the calculation.]]></description>

I&#039;d also like to add that this reasoning runs parallel to the Monty Hall problem. When you pick a door you have some chance of picking the winner, but Monty never picks the winning door. Likewise, when you ask &quot;is one of them a boy?&quot; you have some chance of hitting the jackpot if the parent says &quot;no&quot;, but if the parent does all the talking you don&#039;t get this chance.]]></description>

Now, you may object to my step P(she says “boy”&#124;Boy&#038;Girl) = P(she says “Tuesday”&#124;Tuesday&#038;~Tuesday) = 1/2. Maybe you expect the parent to be biased toward/against singling out boys (or Tuesdays). But that doesn&#039;t really matter for our understanding of the puzzle. The point is that Mr. Egan and Prof. Baez implicitly assumed that these probabilities are 1, and there&#039;s simply no way that we live in such a boy-and-Tuesday-centric world.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The answer to the first puzzle is 1/2. This doesn&#039;t invalidate the second &quot;deep&quot; puzzle because Mr. Egan thought he was working on this similar puzzle:
Mother: “I have two children.&quot;
You: &quot;Is one of them a boy born on a Tuesday?&quot;
Mother: &quot;Yes. Now what is the probability that both are boys?&quot;

Here the answer is 13/27, for reasons outlined above. OP&#039;s puzzle is instead:
Mother: “I have two children. One is a boy born on a Tuesday. What is the probability I have two boys?”

Here you need to account for the fact that P(she says &quot;boy&quot;&#124;Boy&#038;Girl) = 1/2 and P(she says &quot;Tuesday&quot;&#124;Tuesday&#038;~Tuesday) = 1/2. Surprisingly, this makes the final answer P(2 boys) = 1/2. I wish I could show you a nice proof but I arrived at this conclusion by brute force assuming a 2-day week and then generalizing. My inspiration comes from &lt;a href=&quot;http://lesswrong.com/lw/ul/my_bayesian_enlightenment/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; LessWrong post.

I&#039;ve never seen this distinction made outside of LW, though I haven&#039;t read most of the comments here or on Prof. Landsburg&#039;s post on TBQ. I love both versions of this problem. There&#039;s something mischievous about how there&#039;s an obvious answer, but then some deep reasoning gets you to a cool non-obvious answer, but then often some even more deep reasoning brings you right back to the obvious answer, so everyone from math illiterates to math professors gets it wrong about half the time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Bayesian is making bets on 14 different, simultaneously running, games. It&#039;s not that it doesn&#039;t matter, it&#039;s that each is done in isolation as an iteration of one of the 14 running games. 

The real question is, does the probability change if he asks about the day the first child was born, or can he just think it into changing? Also ... hasn&#039;t someone run this expereiment in some way?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/08/24/probability-puzzles-from-egan/#comment-701&quot;&gt;Philip Gibbs&lt;/a&gt;.

In the second experiment if we are always assuming the parent has 2 children as the puzzle stated to begin with then the probability is not 1/2 because if we assume the parent can have any of the following: b/b b/g or g/g then the parent will have flipped a coin only 1/3 and of those 1/3 if we can in this case assume the coin flip is 50/50 then in a sample size of 300 (to make this clean) with an equal amount of b/b b/g g/g then 100 parents will flip a coin first and 50 times the parent will say &quot;I have a boy&quot; and 50 times will say &quot;I have a girl&quot; and if we can assume that 100 parents have b/b and 100 parents have g/g then we can know that 150 out of 300 parents will say &quot;I have a boy&quot; because clearly we can discount g/g which leaves 200 parents, 100 with b/b and 100 with b/g. 100 of the 100 b/b parents will say &quot;I have a boy&quot; while 50 of the b/g parents will say &quot;I have a boy&quot; Therefor of 200 parents, 150 will say &quot;I have a boy&quot; while only 50 will say &quot;I have a girl&quot;

Now since the puzzle began with this person having 2 children we&#039;ll keep it that way and not account for other possibilities (1 boy, 1 girl or 0 children) so if this parent in your scenario says &quot;I have a boy&quot; then we&#039;re left with only these possibilities. He has 2 boys or he has a boy and a girl and he flipped a coin to determine what he would say. Under these guidelines we now know that this parent can only have 2 boys or a boy and a girl.

You can keep the remaining possibilities at a sample size of 200 parents or we can expand it to 2 million, either way under the scenario that you put forth the probability of the parent&#039;s second child also being a boy is 2/3

Here&#039;s why, if the parent (P) had 2 girls P would have under your scenario said &quot;I have a girl&quot; if P had a boy and a girl then P would have flipped a coin, if we just assume that 50 out of 100 times P would get a coin flip result of &quot;I have a boy&quot; and we use a sample size of 300 P (100 b/b 100 b/g 100 g/g) then we know that &quot;I have a boy&quot; means 1 of 2 scenarios, the first is that P has b/b in which case no coin flip is necessary and the chances of the second child being a boy is 100/100 the other scenario is that P flipped a coin and the result was to say &quot;I have a boy&quot; so the chances of the second child being a boy in that scenario is 0/100.

Sounds like 1/2 however of those 150 P who would say &quot;I have a boy&quot; only 50 or 1/3 will actually have b/g and 100 or 2/3 will have b/b. So the answer to scenario 2 is that if the person spoken to knows the rules as you put them then when he is told that the parent has a boy the probability of him having 2 boys is now 2/3]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Q. I have two children. One is a boy. What is the probability I have two sons?
A. 1/2
There are a lot of ways to look at the problem.

1) One child is a boy. The probability of the *other* child being a son is 1/2. So the probability of two sons is 1/2.

2) The boy *being referred to* is either the first child or the second child. 
The probability that the boy being referred to is the first child, let&#039;s call it P(1B), is 1/2.
The probability that the child being referred to is the second child, let&#039;s call it P(2B) is 1/2. 
These are mutually exclusive cases whose probabilities sum to 1.
So probability of two sons = P(1B) * Prob of 2 boys given 1B + P(2B) * Prob of 2 boys given 2B = 1/2*1/2 + 1/2*1/2 = 1/2

3) For each possibility of boys and girls in 2 children, calculate the *number of boys*, let&#039;s call it NB.
The possibilities for NB are 0(GG), 1(BG or GB) and 2(BB).
The original question can be rephrased as, &quot;I have two children. The count of boys is at least 1. What is the probability
that the count of boys is 2?&quot;
Our possibility space is NB = 1 and NB = 2. Prob of NB = 2 is 1/2.

4) The various combinations of boy/girl (B/G), with the order(first or second child) being important are
BG, GB and BB.
Let me label the scenarios with 1,2,3 and the first child and second child with a and b respectively.
Then the combinations are
1Ba,1Gb          2Ga,2Bb	       3Ba,3Bb
The boy being referred to can be 1Ba or 2Bb or 3Ba or 3Bb = total of 4 possibilities.
Out of these, possibilities in which both children are boys = 3Ba and 3Bb = 2 possibilities
So required probability = 2/4 = 1/2

Q. I have two children. One is a boy born on a Tuesday. What is the probability I have two sons?
A. 1/2

The boy being born on a Tuesday is irrelevant. The flaw in Greg Egan&#039;s square counting argument can be seen by
looking at point of view 4) to the question above.
I am referring to the third image from the top on this page, http://gregegan.customer.netspace.net.au/ESSAYS/TUESDAY/Tuesday.html
When both children are boys born on a Tuesday, there are *2* possibilities added to the total possibility space.
The boy being referred to can be either the first child or the second child, so we have to add both
possibilities to the total possibility space. Both these possibilities (in the case when both children are boys)
similarly also contribute to the possible outcomes with 2 boys. That&#039;s why the required probability is 14/28 = 1/2.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Q. I have two children. One is a boy. What is the probability I have two sons?<br />
A. 1/2<br />
There are a lot of ways to look at the problem.</p>
<p>1) One child is a boy. The probability of the *other* child being a son is 1/2. So the probability of two sons is 1/2.</p>
<p>2) The boy *being referred to* is either the first child or the second child.<br />
The probability that the boy being referred to is the first child, let&#8217;s call it P(1B), is 1/2.<br />
The probability that the child being referred to is the second child, let&#8217;s call it P(2B) is 1/2.<br />
These are mutually exclusive cases whose probabilities sum to 1.<br />
So probability of two sons = P(1B) * Prob of 2 boys given 1B + P(2B) * Prob of 2 boys given 2B = 1/2*1/2 + 1/2*1/2 = 1/2</p>
<p>3) For each possibility of boys and girls in 2 children, calculate the *number of boys*, let&#8217;s call it NB.<br />
The possibilities for NB are 0(GG), 1(BG or GB) and 2(BB).<br />
The original question can be rephrased as, &#8220;I have two children. The count of boys is at least 1. What is the probability<br />
that the count of boys is 2?&#8221;<br />
Our possibility space is NB = 1 and NB = 2. Prob of NB = 2 is 1/2.</p>
