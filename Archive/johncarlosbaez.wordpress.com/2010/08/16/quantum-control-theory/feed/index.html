					<description><![CDATA[Hey guys, I saw your thread on quantum control theory. That is my stock-in-trade. An ebook on the topic is located here at http://quantumcontrol.wikidot.com/start if you have any further questions just let me know over social media or email.

Most of the current work is being done on autonomous systems, but the real power is in time optimal quantum control. If it isn&#039;t time optimal, it&#039;s slow to me!!!]]></description>

JB: quantum computation driven by dissipation?

Of course. Without dissipation no measurement
(permanent enough recording to be registered by 
a macroscopic device), and hence no quantum computation. 

The problem is that there are good and bad sides to dissipation, and it is extremely difficult to get only the good sides....]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[RE: “Does anyone out know if ideas from quantum control theory have been used to tackle the problems that decoherence causes in quantum computation?”

You might be interested in the following papers related to feedback stabilization of quantum states. It is complementary to the continuous in time error correction literature that Steve pointed out.

&#8226; Bayesian feedback versus Markovian feedback in a two-level atom. Wiseman, Mancini and Wang, &lt;i&gt;Phys. Rev. A&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;66&lt;/b&gt;, 013807 (2002)

&#8226; Global stability criterion for a quantum feedback control process on a single qubit and exponential stability in case of perfect detection efficiency.  de Vries, &lt;i&gt;Phys. Rev. A&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;75&lt;/b&gt;, 032101 (2007) 

&#8226; Feedback control of nonlinear quantum systems: a rule of thumb. Jacobs and Lund, &lt;i&gt;Phys. Rev. Lett.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;99&lt;/b&gt;, 020501 (2007)

Wow &#8212; thanks for pointing that out!  Just recently I&#039;ve been noticing how &#039;tensor networks&#039; are catching on in quantum information theory, and how a tensor network is a special case of the general concept of &#039;&lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9411007&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;spin network&lt;/a&gt;&#039;: the special case where the gauge group is the trivial group.  I&#039;m talking to people here at the CQT about this... but I hadn&#039;t known of the connection between tensor networks and dissipation and control theory, which are some other subjects I&#039;m hoping to work on here!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Classical Hamiltonian mechanics and fluctuation-dissipation theorems, which are both natural and interesting on Euclidean state-spaces, are similarly natural and (arguably) even &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; geometrically interesting on symplectic state-spaces.

Zounds!  I get the logic of this sentence, but it sounds too good to be true: &lt;i&gt;quantum computation driven by dissipation?&lt;/i&gt;

If it&#039;s not too good to be true, this could be truly good.  What do experts in this field think?]]></description>

Hey, that paper by Matthew James is really good &#8212; a great way for me to start catching up on a huge body of work!  Thanks, Rod!

And when I saw that Matthew James was at Australian National University, I suddenly remembered some emails from his colleague &lt;a href=&quot;http://people.cecs.anu.edu.au/user/151&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Hendra Nurdin&lt;/a&gt;, who pointed me to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://syscon.cecs.anu.edu.au/research/quantum&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;webpage&lt;/a&gt; of the quantum control group at ANU, and recommended these papers:

&#8226; J. Gough and M. R. James, The series product and its application to quantum feedforward and feedback networks, &lt;i&gt;IEEE Trans. Automat. Contr.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;54&lt;/b&gt; (2009), 2530-2544.

&#8226; J. Gough and M. R. James, Quantum feedback networks: Hamiltonian formulation, &lt;i&gt;Comm. Math. Phys.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;287&lt;/b&gt; (2009), 1109-1132.

I had set these emails aside at the time, since I was busy finishing other projects.  But now this is something I&#039;d like to look into.

Thanks for all those other links to papers, too!]]></description>
