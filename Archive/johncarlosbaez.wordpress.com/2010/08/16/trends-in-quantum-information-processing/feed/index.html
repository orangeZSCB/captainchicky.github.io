Strong duality:

It is true generically, in the sense that by changing the problem very little you can enforce it to hold. But there are degenerate cases where it fails.

This can be made completely precise but then the simplicity of the situation as in LP is lost.]]></description>

I&#039;m so glad like you liked my summary of the literature topological computing for approximating the Jones polynomial (and thus #P problems).

Thanks for prettying up the formatting and correcting that error about &quot;&#958;^5&quot;.  I indeed incorrectly notated it, meaning to type &quot;&#958;_5&quot; since it&#039;s indeed meant to signify the 5th root of unity e^{2&#960;i/5}.

Also, I just noted one other error.  I opened the &quot;Long Version&quot; of my comments saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;From Witten, we know that certain observables of a physical system governed by a SU(2) Chern-Simons theory...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I meant to write:

&lt;blockquote&gt;From Witten, we know that &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;the expectation values of&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; certain observables of a physical system governed by a SU(2) Chern-Simons theory...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

All the best!

I&#039;ve always thought that usenet newsgroups, blogging and the like get more interesting when people take them really seriously and put work into their writing.

Your comment is a &lt;i&gt;marvel&lt;/i&gt; of detail and clarity, which takes my rushed summary of topological quantum computation and expands it to a really gripping story.  Thanks!  

I have taken the liberty of polishing your typography a bit, and also changing one sentence of yours.  You had written

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

which seems to conflict with your earlier usage of the letter xi:

So, I&#039;ve changed the former passage to:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
J(&#958;) is the true value of the Jones polynomial at the 5th root of unity &#958; = 2 &#960; i / 5...

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/08/16/trends-in-quantum-information-processing/#comment-657&quot;&gt;John Baez&lt;/a&gt;.

Thank you very much John for cornering Michele and asking him!

Through my own research since asking the question, I have some further thoughts on the issue.  Since I have a deep neurotic drive for completeness, I divide my comments into two versions:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
=== THE SHORT VERSION ===
&lt;/div&gt;

I&#039;ve since come across the topological quantum computing lecture notes of one of Freedman&#039;s frequent co-authors, Zhenghan Wang:

Zhengfan Wang, &lt;i&gt;Topological Quantum Computation&lt;/i&gt;, CBMS Regional Conference Series in Mathematics, Number 112 [American Mathematical Society: Providence, RI 2010].

Most of it is freely viewable* &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books?id=jkzVwceFaAsC&#038;lpg=PP1&#038;dq=Topological%20Quantum%20Computation&#038;pg=PP1#v=onepage&#038;q&#038;f=false&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;on Google Books&lt;/a&gt;, and most conveniently this free portion includes the entirety of Wang&#039;s review of the matters pertinent to my question.

&lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books?id=jkzVwceFaAsC&#038;lpg=PP1&#038;dq=topological%20quantum%20computation&#038;pg=PA35#v=onepage&#038;q&#038;f=false&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Chapter 3: Approximation of the Jones Polynomial&lt;/a&gt;

This chapter nicely summarizes the case that what the naive** type of topological quantum algorithm Freedman proposed in 1998 actually accomplishes is the approximation of the Jones polynomial to within an additive error &#949; in time O[poly(1/&#949;)].  Alas, as Freedman already laid out in his original 1998 proposal, one would need to produce such an approximation exponentially more quickly &#8212; that is, in time O[polylog(1/&#949;)] &#8212; in order to solve #P-hard problems in polynomial time.  Of course, the O[poly(1/&#949;)] result is nothing to be sneezed at: it suffices to reproduce any polynomial time quantum computation &#8212; that is, it&#039;s BQP-complete &#8212; and it&#039;s superpolynomially faster than the best known classical algorithm.

Footnotes: 

* Annoyingly, the freely viewable part does not include the bibliography.  However, I reproduce the relevant portion of Wang&#039;s bibliography below.

** I say &quot;naive&quot; since all one&#039;s doing (!) is directly implementing or computationally simulating a physical system obeying a SU(2) Chern-Simons theory and determining the expectation values of certain system observables by just directly measuring those observables as accurately as one can.  There&#039;s no additional quantum dynamics/quantum information processing before measurement.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
=== THE LONG VERSION ===
&lt;/div&gt;

My fuller understanding of the chronology is as follows (NB: references follow Wang&#039;s abbreviations):

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
*** 1998 ***
&lt;/div&gt;

Freedman&#039;s 1998 Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. paper that you reference above [Fr1] made 2 key points

   i) From Witten, we know that the expectation values of certain observables of a physical system governed by a SU(2) Chern-Simons theory will be values of the Jones polynomial at nontrivial roots of unity.  This fact immediately suggests an algorithm for approximating the Jones polynomial at these nontrivial roots.  Namely, just build the system and then repeatedly measure these observables as accurately as one can.   Now, this possibly is a naive algorithm since all the quantum &quot;processing&quot; is the system just evolving under its SU(2) Chern-Simons theory without any extra quantum dynamics/algorithmic processing being performed.  But, who knows?  Potentially, it&#039;s optimal.  In any case, analyzing this possibly naive algorithm is nontrivial in and of itself, so let&#039;s start here.

   ii) On that note, how accurate would your measurements have to be in order to solve the #P-hard problem of exactly evaluating the Jones polynomial at nontrivial roots?  Freedman&#039;s conclusion was you needed to measure with an accuracy threshold that shrinks *exponentially* in the size of the problem, though he phrased it in terms of needing a &quot;linear&quot; number of &quot;reliable bits&quot;.  Specifically, he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus the number of reliable bits in each observation required to error correct to the exact values of J(&#958;&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;) [&lt;i&gt;that is, the exact values of the Jones polynomial at integer powers a of the rth root of unity &#958; = 2 &#960; i / r &lt;/i&gt;] is linear in the size of the problem #K [&lt;i&gt;that is, the number of crossings in the knot K to which this Jones polynomial J applies&lt;/i&gt;] … In other contexts, such as quantum computing, this scaling of accuracy requirements has been considered reasonable although a better goal for accuracy of individual measurements is poly(log K) bits or even a small constant number of bits. Because r &#8776; 4#K observations are required to solve the linear system, a total of quadratically-many bits must be collected before all observational errors can be corrected.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Now, while the exponentially fine accuracy afforded by a linearly growing number of bits is a routine task in classical digital computing (e.g., the arbitrary precision arithmetic done by Lisp, Python, Mathematica, Maple, etc.), it&#039;s a pretty grim omen for the odd hybrid of analog and digital computing that is quantum computing.  But as Freedman notes, there are some quantum computing contexts where exponential such accuracy is achievable with polynomially-bounded memory and time resources.  For example (and, of course, I&#039;m not sure whether this is the example to which Freedman was alluding), the quantum phase estimation algorithm can measure the phase of an eigenvalue from a unitary operator down to n bits of accuracy with just O(n) qubits and O(n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) time.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
*** 2000 ***
&lt;/div&gt;

Freedman and coworkers establish that topological quantum computation isn&#039;t fundamentally more powerful than standard quantum computation (i.e., circuits with unitary operators for gates).  Each can simulate the other with only polynomial overhead [FKW, FLW1]. Though there wasn&#039;t yet an explicit argument for why the exponential accuracy required to solve #P problems exactly would be intractable, I have a feeling that this was one of the times that, as you put it John, &quot;with a great sigh of relief, computer scientists decided they didn’t need to learn topological quantum field theory.&quot; 

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
*** 2001 ***
&lt;/div&gt;

Freedman and coworkers present an explicit analysis [FKLW] of a topological quantum computer on which one can perform the naive algorithm of just implementing the system and measure the relevant observables as accurately as possible.  *Implicit* in the answer they get for the probability of a certain of measurement outcome is that approximating the Jones polynomial at the 5th root of unity to within an additive error &#949; will require time of O[Poly(1/&#949;)] --- that is, if J(&#958;) is the true value of the Jones polynomial at the 5th root of unity &#958; = 2 &#960; i / 5, then producing an estimate J&lt;sub&gt;est&lt;/sub&gt;(&#958;) &#8712; [J(&#958;) - &#949;, J(&#958;) + &#949;] requires time O[Poly(1/&#949;)].   As such, it&#039;s *implicit* in [FKLW] that achieving the exponential accuracy demands set out in [Fr1] requires exponential time.

However, Freedman, et al. do *not* make this explicit (at least not in published work) for another 4 years.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
*** 2005 ***
&lt;/div&gt;

It&#039;s at this point that it becomes explicit that efficient &quot;additive approximation&quot; of the Jones polynomial is really what this naive algorithm accomplishes and not efficient solution of #P-hard problems. 

First, Freedman and coworkers sketch out the connection between topological quantum computing and &quot;approximate counting&quot; problems in general [BFLW].

And soon after, two researchers from the standard quantum computation community, Dorit Aharonov and Zeph Landau, along with Vaughan Jones himself [AJL] make it clear that in order to devise efficient quantum additive approximation algorithms for Jones polynomial, you really don&#039;t need to know any topological quantum field theory and instead just a little algebraic knot theory.  Computer scientists definitely breath a &quot;great sigh of relief&quot;.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
*** 2006 and later ***
&lt;/div&gt;

With topological quantum field theory no longer a necessary prerequisite, various researchers from the standard quantum computing community publish results on efficient quantum additive approximations of various knot polynomials [e.g., AAEL, SJ, WY].

And at least 2 people who aren&#039;t obviously crackpots ;) hold out hope that a more advanced use of topological quantum resources (processing with a supposedly efficient non-Abelian quantum Fourier transform?) can produce better results for #P-hard problems [MR].

<p>Thank you very much John for cornering Michele and asking him!</p>
<p>Through my own research since asking the question, I have some further thoughts on the issue.  Since I have a deep neurotic drive for completeness, I divide my comments into two versions:</p>
<div align="center">
=== THE SHORT VERSION ===
</div>
<p>I&#8217;ve since come across the topological quantum computing lecture notes of one of Freedman&#8217;s frequent co-authors, Zhenghan Wang:</p>
<p>Zhengfan Wang, <i>Topological Quantum Computation</i>, CBMS Regional Conference Series in Mathematics, Number 112 [American Mathematical Society: Providence, RI 2010].</p>
<p>Most of it is freely viewable* <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=jkzVwceFaAsC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Topological%20Quantum%20Computation&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" rel="nofollow">on Google Books</a>, and most conveniently this free portion includes the entirety of Wang&#8217;s review of the matters pertinent to my question.</p>
<p><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=jkzVwceFaAsC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=topological%20quantum%20computation&amp;pg=PA35#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" rel="nofollow">Chapter 3: Approximation of the Jones Polynomial</a></p>
<p>This chapter nicely summarizes the case that what the naive** type of topological quantum algorithm Freedman proposed in 1998 actually accomplishes is the approximation of the Jones polynomial to within an additive error &#949; in time O[poly(1/&#949;)].  Alas, as Freedman already laid out in his original 1998 proposal, one would need to produce such an approximation exponentially more quickly &mdash; that is, in time O[polylog(1/&#949;)] &mdash; in order to solve #P-hard problems in polynomial time.  Of course, the O[poly(1/&#949;)] result is nothing to be sneezed at: it suffices to reproduce any polynomial time quantum computation &mdash; that is, it&#8217;s BQP-complete &mdash; and it&#8217;s superpolynomially faster than the best known classical algorithm.</p>
<p>Footnotes: </p>
<p>* Annoyingly, the freely viewable part does not include the bibliography.  However, I reproduce the relevant portion of Wang&#8217;s bibliography below.</p>
<p>** I say &#8220;naive&#8221; since all one&#8217;s doing (!) is directly implementing or computationally simulating a physical system obeying a SU(2) Chern-Simons theory and determining the expectation values of certain system observables by just directly measuring those observables as accurately as one can.  There&#8217;s no additional quantum dynamics/quantum information processing before measurement.</p>
<div align="center">
=== THE LONG VERSION ===
</div>
<p>My fuller understanding of the chronology is as follows (NB: references follow Wang&#8217;s abbreviations):</p>
<div align="center">
*** 1998 ***
</div>
<p>Freedman&#8217;s 1998 Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. paper that you reference above [Fr1] made 2 key points</p>
<p>   i) From Witten, we know that the expectation values of certain observables of a physical system governed by a SU(2) Chern-Simons theory will be values of the Jones polynomial at nontrivial roots of unity.  This fact immediately suggests an algorithm for approximating the Jones polynomial at these nontrivial roots.  Namely, just build the system and then repeatedly measure these observables as accurately as one can.   Now, this possibly is a naive algorithm since all the quantum &#8220;processing&#8221; is the system just evolving under its SU(2) Chern-Simons theory without any extra quantum dynamics/algorithmic processing being performed.  But, who knows?  Potentially, it&#8217;s optimal.  In any case, analyzing this possibly naive algorithm is nontrivial in and of itself, so let&#8217;s start here.</p>
<p>   ii) On that note, how accurate would your measurements have to be in order to solve the #P-hard problem of exactly evaluating the Jones polynomial at nontrivial roots?  Freedman&#8217;s conclusion was you needed to measure with an accuracy threshold that shrinks *exponentially* in the size of the problem, though he phrased it in terms of needing a &#8220;linear&#8221; number of &#8220;reliable bits&#8221;.  Specifically, he wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thus the number of reliable bits in each observation required to error correct to the exact values of J(&xi;<sup>a</sup>) [<i>that is, the exact values of the Jones polynomial at integer powers a of the rth root of unity &xi; = 2 &pi; i / r </i>] is linear in the size of the problem #K [<i>that is, the number of crossings in the knot K to which this Jones polynomial J applies</i>] … In other contexts, such as quantum computing, this scaling of accuracy requirements has been considered reasonable although a better goal for accuracy of individual measurements is poly(log K) bits or even a small constant number of bits. Because r &asymp; 4#K observations are required to solve the linear system, a total of quadratically-many bits must be collected before all observational errors can be corrected.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, while the exponentially fine accuracy afforded by a linearly growing number of bits is a routine task in classical digital computing (e.g., the arbitrary precision arithmetic done by Lisp, Python, Mathematica, Maple, etc.), it&#8217;s a pretty grim omen for the odd hybrid of analog and digital computing that is quantum computing.  But as Freedman notes, there are some quantum computing contexts where exponential such accuracy is achievable with polynomially-bounded memory and time resources.  For example (and, of course, I&#8217;m not sure whether this is the example to which Freedman was alluding), the quantum phase estimation algorithm can measure the phase of an eigenvalue from a unitary operator down to n bits of accuracy with just O(n) qubits and O(n<sup>2</sup>) time.</p>
<div align="center">
*** 2000 ***
</div>
<p>Freedman and coworkers establish that topological quantum computation isn&#8217;t fundamentally more powerful than standard quantum computation (i.e., circuits with unitary operators for gates).  Each can simulate the other with only polynomial overhead [FKW, FLW1]. Though there wasn&#8217;t yet an explicit argument for why the exponential accuracy required to solve #P problems exactly would be intractable, I have a feeling that this was one of the times that, as you put it John, &#8220;with a great sigh of relief, computer scientists decided they didn’t need to learn topological quantum field theory.&#8221; </p>
<div align="center">
*** 2001 ***
</div>
<p>Freedman and coworkers present an explicit analysis [FKLW] of a topological quantum computer on which one can perform the naive algorithm of just implementing the system and measure the relevant observables as accurately as possible.  *Implicit* in the answer they get for the probability of a certain of measurement outcome is that approximating the Jones polynomial at the 5th root of unity to within an additive error &#949; will require time of O[Poly(1/&#949;)] &#8212; that is, if J(&xi;) is the true value of the Jones polynomial at the 5th root of unity &xi; = 2 &pi; i / 5, then producing an estimate J<sub>est</sub>(&xi;) &#8712; [J(&xi;) &#8211; &#949;, J(&xi;) + &#949;] requires time O[Poly(1/&#949;)].   As such, it&#8217;s *implicit* in [FKLW] that achieving the exponential accuracy demands set out in [Fr1] requires exponential time.</p>
<p>However, Freedman, et al. do *not* make this explicit (at least not in published work) for another 4 years.</p>
<div align="center">
*** 2005 ***
</div>
<p>It&#8217;s at this point that it becomes explicit that efficient &#8220;additive approximation&#8221; of the Jones polynomial is really what this naive algorithm accomplishes and not efficient solution of #P-hard problems. </p>
<p>First, Freedman and coworkers sketch out the connection between topological quantum computing and &#8220;approximate counting&#8221; problems in general [BFLW].</p>
<p>And soon after, two researchers from the standard quantum computation community, Dorit Aharonov and Zeph Landau, along with Vaughan Jones himself [AJL] make it clear that in order to devise efficient quantum additive approximation algorithms for Jones polynomial, you really don&#8217;t need to know any topological quantum field theory and instead just a little algebraic knot theory.  Computer scientists definitely breath a &#8220;great sigh of relief&#8221;.</p>
<div align="center">
*** 2006 and later ***
</div>
<p>With topological quantum field theory no longer a necessary prerequisite, various researchers from the standard quantum computing community publish results on efficient quantum additive approximations of various knot polynomials [e.g., AAEL, SJ, WY].</p>
<p>And at least 2 people who aren&#8217;t obviously crackpots ;) hold out hope that a more advanced use of topological quantum resources (processing with a supposedly efficient non-Abelian quantum Fourier transform?) can produce better results for #P-hard problems [MR].</p>

Yes John, I noticed you are rather close by. Hopefully we should be able to meet up before you pack your bags again! :)


Yes, of course those two are categories, the second looks like a double category to me ...

Don&#039;t know anything about composing programs, except for the physicists&#039; view that breaking a problem into pieces usually helps solve it faster. 

Do linear programming and its duality have categorical interpretations?]]></description>

I finally succeeded in cornering Michele and asking him your question.

Michele said Freedman hadn&#039;t made any &lt;i&gt;mistake&lt;/i&gt; in his paper: he had merely left open the question whether an implementable topological quantum computer could have enough accuracy to solve #P-hard problems.  Later it became clear that they do not.  But Michele said he didn&#039;t know whether this result had been published: he had only heard it from a colleague.]]></description>

Hi, Amitabha!  I&#039;m in your neighborhood now!

I actually haven&#039;t thought at all about these &#039;semidefinite programs&#039;.  I was just taking notes on this talk.   But I guess you&#039;re right: there is a category where:

&#8226; an object $latex (X,a)$ is a Hilbert space $latex X$ equipped with self-adjoint operator $latex a$, and 

&#8226; a morphism $latex \Phi$ from $latex (X,a)$ to $latex (Y,b)$ is a &lt;b&gt;semidefinite program&lt;/b&gt;: that is, a superoperator from operators on $latex X$ to operators on $latex Y$ that happens to send $a$ to $b$.  

So then the question is: have people thought about composing semidefinite programs?  Is it useful to do so?

The duality for semidefinite programs might also have a nice categorical interpretation.

Thanks!]]></description>
