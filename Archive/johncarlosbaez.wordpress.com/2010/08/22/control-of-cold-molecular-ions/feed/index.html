Thanks very much, Jedrzej!  

I felt funny at first putting the quantum theory and condensed matter physics posts on this blog, because they sort of distract from its environmental slant.  I even considered putting them on another blog.  But then I remembered that ultimately I want to focus not on the &lt;i&gt;fact&lt;/i&gt; that we have environmental problems, but &lt;i&gt;what scientists can do about these problems&lt;/i&gt;.  And that means I&#039;ll be writing about photovoltaic solar cells, nuclear power, nanotechnology, the &#039;smart grid&#039; and more... and I want experts to read this stuff and help out.  So, I realized I should not separate my different scientific interests.

I&#039;m still busy learning about condensed matter physics and quantum theory, and I&#039;ll blog more about them soon.  They&#039;re just as fun &#8212; and just as mathematically interesting! &#8212; as the stuff I used to write about.  Optical lattices, the Hubbard model, tensor networks... you&#039;ll see.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Professor Baez,

I thought I&#039;d let you know that I really appreciate the work you put into your blog, and your brilliant posts. I do enjoy the new slant of the blog - climate science is particularly prone to becoming excruciatingly dull, but not when you do it.

However, I would ask, if you could, to keep up the theoretical quantum/condensed matter posts - though I&#039;m only now catching up with the background to understand them properly, I found that they steered my interests into completely new areas; each one was an extremely valuable read.

Finally, thanks again for all the effort that goes into this blog. I&#039;m speaking for myself, and I&#039;m sure many other people out there.

That is exactly the feeling I have after reading your findings: that thing is not THAT complicated...

Thank you for all your good work.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear John Baez, 

an almost diagonal Franck-Condon factor means that different vibrational states associated with two different electronic states are almost orthogonal. Hence, the ions in a particular electronic-vibrational &#124;e,v&#062; state will not make frequent transitions to a different &#124;e&#039;,v&#062; state.

Regards,
Roberto]]></description>
