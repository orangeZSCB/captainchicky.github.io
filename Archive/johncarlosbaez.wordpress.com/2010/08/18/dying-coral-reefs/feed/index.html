There is one - and only one - German oyster farm in the north sea at the coast of the island Sylt. The tides have a very strong effect in the north sea; the water line moves several kilometers, so that the oysters are under water half of the time, which is a kind of body building (open shell, close shell, open shell, close shell). 
Those oysters are really expensive, but you&#039;ll see them on sale, if you go to the really good chefs, for quite some time after there are no oysters left in the wild.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There are a bunch of potentially useful links here, though the article itself is not very informative: what, for example, does it mean to say that oysters are &#039;functionally extinct&#039;?  I still see them for sale.

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;State of the ocean: &#039;shocking&#039; report warns of mass extinction from current rate of marine distress&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Huffington Post&lt;/i&gt;, 20 June 2011.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preliminary report from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stateoftheocean.org/&quot; target=&quot;_hplink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;International Programme on the State of the Ocean&lt;/a&gt; (IPSO) is the result of the first-ever interdisciplinary international workshop examining the combined impact of all of the stressors currently affecting the oceans, including pollution, warming, acidification, overfishing and hypoxia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The findings are shocking,&quot; Dr. Alex Rogers, IPSO&#039;s scientific director, said in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stateoftheocean.org/pdfs/1806_IPSOPR.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_hplink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; released by the group.  &quot;This is a very serious situation demanding unequivocal action at every level.  We are looking at consequences for humankind that will impact in our lifetime, and worse, our children&#039;s and generations beyond that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scientific panel concluded that degeneration in the oceans is happening much faster than has been predicted, and that the combination of factors currently distressing the marine environment is contributing to the precise conditions that have been associated with all major extinctions in the Earth&#039;s history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the report, three major factors have been present in the handful of mass extinctions that have occurred in the past: an increase of both hypoxia (low oxygen) and anoxia (lack of oxygen that creates &quot;dead zones&quot;) in the oceans, warming and acidification. The panel warns that the combination of these factors will inevitably cause a mass marine extinction if swift action isn&#039;t taken to improve conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report is the latest of several published in recent months examining the dire conditions of the oceans.  A recent World Resources Institute report suggests that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/02/25/coral-reefs-may-be-gone-b_n_827709.html&quot; target=&quot;_hplink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;all coral reefs could be gone by 2050&lt;/a&gt; if no action is taken to protect them, while a study published earlier this year in &lt;em&gt;BioScience&lt;/em&gt; declares &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/02/04/oysters-are-functionally-_n_818870.html&quot; target=&quot;_hplink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;oysters as &quot;functionally extinct&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, their populations decimated by over-harvesting and disease.  Just last week scientists forecasted that this year&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/14/gulf-dead-zone-predicted-largest-in-history_n_877188.html&quot; target=&quot;_hplink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Gulf &quot;dead zone&quot; will be the largest in history&lt;/a&gt; due to increased runoff from the Mississippi River dragging in high levels of nitrates and phosphates from fertilizers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent study in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, meanwhile, suggests that not only will the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/03/sixth-mass-extinction_n_830947.html&quot; target=&quot;_hplink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;next mass extinction be man-made&lt;/a&gt;, but that it could already be underway. Unless humans make significant changes to their behavior, that is.&lt;/p&gt;

The IPSO report calls for such changes, recommending actions in key areas: immediate reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, coordinated efforts to restore marine ecosystems, and universal implementation of the precautionary principle so &quot;activities proceed only if they are shown not to harm the ocean singly or in combination with other activities.&quot; The panel also calls for the UN to swiftly introduce an &quot;effective governance of the High Seas.&quot;

&quot;The challenges for the future of the ocean are vast, but unlike previous generations we know what now needs to happen,&quot; Dan Laffoley of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) and co-author of the report said in a press release for the new report. &quot;The time to protect the blue heart of our planet is now, today and urgent.&quot;

Why does increasing the dissolved CO2 concentration in seawater affect shell building in marine organisms?

says that what sound like small increases in ocean acidity (especially on the logarithmic pH scale) can have significant effects. I guess the question becomes why there&#039;s significant acidity differences at various points around the globe.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yesterday on Croatian TV there was a woman from Dalmatia who does artistic jewelry out of sea shells. She was very concerned about the polution in the oceans. One of the striking details she was claiming is that even the structure of a shell is clearly falling down with the polution in oceans. 
For example the shells from around Indonesia, while they look externally equally nice like the shells from somewhere around New Guinea where the polution is smaller, in fact are much easier to break during working on it (for jewelry purposes); there are more natural fractures and the material is less hard. It would be interesting to know what aspect of polution makes the shells &quot;softer&quot;. I consider the places where such beautiful shells live, relatively clean, so it is interesting that the mechanical properties fall down with relatively low polution.]]></description>
