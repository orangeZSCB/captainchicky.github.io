Hi, Bruce.  Thanks!  I wanted to end on a high note, so I worked for weeks on this.  The papers with Jim Dolan and Todd Trimble round out the story...

I hope to see more of you around here.]]></description>

Thanks, David.  Yeah, I&#039;d like to understand this better.  

Here&#039;s part of what I do understand:

A &#039;discrete-time dynamical system&#039; is just a $latex \mathbb{Z}$-set, and a $latex \mathbb{Z}$-set has a zeta function which I described back in &#034;&lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week218.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;week218&lt;/a&gt;&#034;, but which turns out to be called the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artin%E2%80%93Mazur_zeta_function&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Artin-Mazur zeta function&lt;/a&gt;.  The algebraic closure of $latex \mathbb{F}_p$, called $latex \overline{\mathbb{F}}_p$, becomes a discrete dynamical system thanks to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frobenius_endomorphism&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Frobenius automorphism&lt;/a&gt;

$latex x \mapsto x^p $

and the fixed points of the nth power of the Frobenius form the field $latex \mathbb{F}_{p^n}$.  This provides the link between the zeta functions of dynamical systems and zeta functions in number theory.

All this stuff is unmysterious to me, and I&#039;ve almost managed to categorify the usual story.

But, there are also more tenuous and mysterious analogies between zeta functions in number theory and zeta functions of dynamical systems like flows on 3-manifolds.  These rely in part on the fact that $latex Spec(\mathbb{Z})$ looks 3-dimensional viewed from the eyes of &#233;tale cohomology.  You may recall me talking about this in &#034;&lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week257.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;week257&lt;/a&gt;&#034;.  The &quot;Addenda&quot; contain some extra useful hints.  You&#039;ll see the Frobenius plays a key role here, so it&#039;s not as if this stuff is &lt;i&gt;distinct&lt;/i&gt; from the stuff I understand.  But I don&#039;t have a good feeling for &#233;tale cohomology, so it seems more mysterious to me &#8212; even the part that Barry Mazur, say, would understand quite well.]]></description>

There&#039;s a Math Overflow &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathoverflow.net/questions/4075/questions-about-analogy-between-spec-z-and-3-manifolds/4108#4108&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt; on Deninger&#039;s work which says

&lt;blockquote&gt;

you should think of a number field not as an unadorned 3-manifold but as a 3-manifold with a flow on it. And then the finite primes are not just knots, but closed orbits of that flow! That gives a more satisfying answer to &quot;why should a 3-manifold have a distinguished countably infinite family of knots on it,&quot; makes the connection with dynamical zeta functions, etc.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

I didn&#039;t define any &quot;number of elements&quot; to be 1/n!.  I said that if an object in a groupoid has some number of symmetries, we use the reciprocal of that number to say how much that object contributes to the &quot;size&quot; of that groupoid.   

A set with n elements has n! symmetries: all the permutations of that set.  So, in the groupoid of finite sets, any set with n elements contributes 1/n! to the size.  And since all sets with n elements are isomorphic, we don&#039;t count all of them separately &#8212; any one will do.

Why do we we take the reciprocal of the number of symmetries?  This has lots of benefits: for example, it lets us take a 5-element set and &quot;divide it by 2&quot; and get a groupoid with size 5/2.  Look at the picture &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/cardinality/cardinality.pdf#page=9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see what I mean.]]></description>

We can implement this using rewrite rules.

An element of a binary tree can be written as a parenthesization of an expression built using multiplication and 1. Eg. 1((11)1)

Starting with such an expression we repeatedly use the rules below where

A -&#062; b, C

means if your current expression matches A, output the number b, and make C the new current expression. It always terminates, consumes a tree, and eventually outputs the string of 0&#039;s and 1&#039;s that you want. This was derived directly from your algebraic derivation:


    (ab, cd, ef) -&#062; 0, (a, b, c(d(ef)))
    (ab, cd, 1 ) -&#062; 0, (a, b, c(d1))
    (ab, 1,  cd) -&#062; 1, (a, b, cd)
    (ab, 1,  1 ) -&#062; 0, (a, b, 1)
    (1,  ab, cd) -&#062; 0, (a, b, (cd)1)
    (1,  ab, 1 ) -&#062; 0, (a, b, 11)
    (1,  1,  ab) -&#062; 1, (a, b, 1)
    (1,  1,  1)  -&#062; END

The rules are trivially confluent as only one rule can apply at each stage.

It&#039;s easy to run in reverse too.

I was hoping there might be some neat geometrical picture showing how these trees pack together exactly to make bit strings. Haven&#039;t figured one out yet.

(Everything modulo typos, of course.)]]></description>

Yes, I love that paper!  I was just trying to say that if your category is closed in addition to being a rig category, then you might be able to handle isomorphisms that involve exponentiation, like inverses.]]></description>
