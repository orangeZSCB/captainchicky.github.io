					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/08/11/quantum-phase-measurement-via-flux-qubits/#comment-461&quot;&gt;Allen Knutson&lt;/a&gt;.

That&#039;s right &#8212; good old E. T. &quot;Extraterrestrial&quot; Jaynes.

I removed this from an earlier draft because I thought it was too distracting, but now you&#039;ve given me an excuse to mention it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A single mode of the electromagnetic field is nicely described by a quantum harmonic oscillator, and the Jaynes-Cummings model describes a quantum harmonic oscillator coupled to a qubit. (Fred Cummings is an old family friend, who also happens to have taught physics at U.C. Riverside, so I&#039;m always happy to see this model come up. Jaynes is &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Thompson_Jaynes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;E. T. Jaynes&lt;/a&gt; of maximum entropy fame.) 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cummings was also Jack Sarfatti&#039;s thesis advisor &#8212; a deed that almost cancelled out all his positive achievements.]]></description>
