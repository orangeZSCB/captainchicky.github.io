You&#039;ve probably already interviewed Sandy Pentland but, in the event you haven&#039;t:

http://socialphysics.media.mit.edu/book/

I think most of the problems confronting human society have as their source that which Dr. Pentland calls &quot;the tragedy of the commons.&quot;

“The Fremen were supreme in that quality the ancients called &quot;spannungsbogen&quot; -- which is the self-imposed delay between desire for a thing and the act of reaching out to grasp that thing.”

“There should be a science of discontent. People need hard times to develop psychic muscles.&quot;

Both of those are from Dune and, being a trans-humanist, I don&#039;t necessarily agree with the series&#039; premise on AGI but there&#039;s a great deal of truth in it nonetheless. I think Buddhism is a very capable &quot;science of discontent&quot; but that&#039;s probably because it happens to be where I seek refuge. Anyway, as a Buddhist, I can safely say, there&#039;s nothing at all wrong with the world; it&#039;s perfect as it is, otherwise, it would be different.]]></description>

@Hank Roberts

The link &quot;TEPCO writes&quot; above links to TEPCO (i.e. the electricity company, which is in charge for the Fukushima power plant). I cited a Google-translated remark from that japanese page reporting about an incident on Dec 27, 2013 (the year is in the header) - if Google translate is correct. It&#039;s a bit hard to find this report among all the other reports.]]></description>

See if you can find the origin of that; when I look for it, I find a handful of blogs quoting the same thing, but nothing recent from Tepco as a primary source since sometime last July.  It may be old news, not new news.]]></description>

By the way does someone have an explanation for the steam which as it seems is being pushed out at reactor 3?

&lt;a href=&quot;http://translate.google.de/translate?hl=de&#038;sl=ja&#038;tl=en&#038;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tepco.co.jp%2Fnu-news%2F2013%2F1233248_5304.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;TEPCO writes&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;※ 48 At around 7:00 am on December 27, and confirmed by the camera that from Unit 3 reactor building, 5th floor near the center, steam is generated. Have not been identified abnormal plant conditions of 54 minutes at 7:00 am the same day, the indicated value of the monitoring post (meteorological data of 50 minutes at 7:00 am, 5.1 ℃ temperature, 93.1% humidity). &lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

This &quot;study&quot; ignores the potential loss of life over a span the time where nuclear byproducts are lethal, ie. suppose there is a collapse of modern society, such as happened many times before, and information is lost, and regions of exposure exist that are very high and unknown.  Also ignored are the lost opportunities: using limited resources in mitigating radiation damage could otherwise be used in eradicating AIDS, Malaria, Polio, etc.

This study only looks at the past, and makes no account of potential; particularly in an environment where nuclear power is ubiquitous.  Nuclear fuel byproducts have a potential for causing damage that far exceeds a coal mine and the burning of carbon; I think this is understood intuitively.  

I will try to find a way of quantifying this potential with data.  The first calculation I will make is the &quot;death potential&quot; of one gram of Uranium-235 and Plutonium-239, to one gram of coal.]]></description>

That&#039;s your opinion, but I&#039;ve already heard a large range of opinions on nuclear power, so each additional opinion is of very limited value: it&#039;s mostly useful for updating my estimate of the probability distribution of opinions of people who feel like expressing their opinion.

Thank you; but I still have to argue that the &quot;Safety&quot; of a plant isn&#039;t something one measures in &quot;lives&quot; variables (input, output, etc.) only (keyword: &quot;only&quot;), so much as a collection of values, including sick future generations, and property, and other unmeasured, under-represented, parameters of value.  This is why fire fighters lose their lives: they know this.

One can&#039;t just take whole sections of the surface of the planet and contaminate them continually, each successive failure compiling over the others!  

I think this is an intuitive response to your critique of my point-of-view. 

I would like to add, that fission is only good at making bombs, and keeping an educated group of scientists involved in the engineering of predicting the outcomes of nuclear reactions and &quot;controlling&quot; them.  I say this in hope, that this knowledge and involvement will increase the likelihood other nuclear reactions will also be engineered and controlled, such as fusion.  

Finally, I actually say that this is the only reason fission energy production is a good thing: it merely creates interest at the forefront of physics and engineering, and human knowledge; but as far as an energy source, it has proven to be a failure at this known rate to make any significant impact of total consumption.

But fission also explodes things: immediate output of the most extreme quantities of energy.  And that&#039;s pretty good, too.]]></description>
