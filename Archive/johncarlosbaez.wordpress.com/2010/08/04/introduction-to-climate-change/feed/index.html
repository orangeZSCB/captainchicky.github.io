					<description><![CDATA[Some time ago, I decided to write my own introduction.

After &quot;climate gate&quot;, I wanted to check a couple of things for myself. The most simple model I could think of predicts a couple of degrees of global warming due to human CO2 emissions.

I also tried to do some estimates of how you could replace fossil fuels.

I&#039;m &lt;i&gt;definitely&lt;/i&gt; going to say a lot about ocean acidification and other threats to the ocean (like overfishing, dead zones and the decline of phytoplankton) in the new &lt;i&gt;This Week&#039;s Finds&lt;/i&gt;.

Since you mentioned this is stuff you haven&#039;t thought about before, I&#039;ll just mention something that&#039;s not strictly &lt;em&gt;climate&lt;/em&gt; change but has the potential to have a large effect on ecosystems: ocean acidification. Here&#039;s a recent paper on the topic:

http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v3/n3/abs/ngeo755.html

Since this appears to be another consequence of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, it naturally connects with other reasons why (some people are of the opinion) something needs to be done about carbon dioxide levels. (Here&#039;s the abstract:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

Increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in sea water are driving a progressive acidification of the ocean. Although the associated changes in the carbonate chemistry of surface and deep waters may adversely affect marine calcifying organisms current experiments do not always produce consistent results for a given species. Ocean sediments record past biological responses to transient greenhouse warming and ocean acidification. During the Palaeocene–Eocene thermal maximum, for example, the biodiversity of benthic calcifying organisms decreased markedly6, 7, whereas extinctions of surface dwellers were very limited8, 9. Here we use the Earth system model GENIE-1 to simulate and compare directly past and present environmental changes in the marine realm. In our simulation of future ocean conditions, we find an undersaturation with respect to carbonate in the deep ocean that exceeds that experienced during the Palaeocene–Eocene thermal maximum and could endanger calcifying organisms. Furthermore, our simulations show higher rates of environmental change at the surface for the future than the Palaeocene–Eocene thermal maximum, which could potentially challenge the ability of plankton to adapt.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hi Nathan,

Thanks for the breakdown.  This list is full of ideas I have never even thought about before, but also not too overwhelming.  I think it could really be quite helpful for me.  

I am also in the middle of a move, so I will take a closer look at some of the topics you mention when things settle down a bit.

Best,
Alex]]></description>

Naturally, there were responses to the Lockwood and Fröhlich paper. For example, Svensmark and Friis-Christensen, wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spacecenter.dk/publications/scientific-report-series/Scient_No._3.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Reply to Lockwood and Fröhlich – The persistent role of the Sun in climate forcing&lt;/a&gt;, and Shaviv&#039;s reply is &lt;a href=&quot;http://motls.blogspot.com/2007/07/nir-shaviv-why-is-lockwood-and-frohlich.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. No doubt there were replies to the replies.

I &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8615789.stm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;see&lt;/a&gt; Lockwood argues for regional change due to solar activity. We Europeans may be in for some chilly winters, he thinks. The full article is &lt;a href=&quot;http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/5/2/024001&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

Is there anywhere predicted to have warmer winters through a Maunder-like minimum?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/08/04/introduction-to-climate-change/#comment-389&quot;&gt;David Corfield&lt;/a&gt;.

Certainly the sun has a big impact on earth&#039;s climate which can be seen in a variety of places and these are worthwhile debates. It just seems to me a real stretch to claim they are the main event. even basic features like the day/night warming pattern tend to go against it.

I won&#039;t repeat points that have already been made, but to add a few:

Specifically on Shaviv&#039;s work on cosmic rays which he cites in part III, so far as I know he hasn&#039;t replied to the criticism in &lt;a href=&quot;http://iopscience.iop.org/1538-4357/705/2/L101&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; work.

On cosmic rays more generally, they may well have some effect but it looks to me to be small. Reading Svensmark&#039;s book The Chilling Stars what was striking was how he claimed that because his cosmic ray mechanism was important and no one else can explain climate, conventional climate science must be wrong but without explaining how. It also relies quite heavily on the poor understanding of clouds (no one knows, so it must be cosmic rays...). But while clouds remain mysterious certainly much more has been learnt known about their nucleation in the last few years (dust, acid, bacteria, lead, etc.) That in itself puts pressure on the cosmic ray argument.

It seems to me that while climate science is very much a work in progress, unless the solar and cosmic ray people can show where it has gone wrong I think they will be better off trying to fit in somewhere in that picture rather than replace it.

Skeptics first pointed to changes in Total Solar Irradiance as a cause of warming, which was not implausible. Satellite observations date from 1978, and you need a couple of 11 year cycles to begin to draw conclusions. It now looks like changes in TSI cannot account for warming. (People have tried to derive climate sensitivity from what changes are observed and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amath.washington.edu/research/articles/Tung/journals/solar-jgr.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;conclude&lt;/a&gt; it lies in the range 2.3-4.1K per CO2 doubling.)

But most of the variation in TSI is in the UV. Fred Singer, for example, has claimed that this could be important. But again the observations seem to go against it. (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.springerlink.com/content/m95w93084l347746/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;  - I think there is more on this I&#039;m not familiar with.)]]></description>

I would strongly second Spencer Weart&#039;s &lt;i&gt;Discovery of Global Warming&lt;/i&gt;, linked above.

If you want to study the science of climate in a bit more depth the problem is that a lot of work aimed at policy makers, e.g. the Copenhagen diagnosis and IPCC report summaries (I haven&#039;t read Houghton but skimming it, it looks similar), tends to just present conclusions. The research literature, of course, takes for granted the important established results.

The history helps show how and why problems arose and then how they were (or still remain to be) resolved. At least for me, it helps give the big picture.

Another brief overview of the historical development is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch1.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;chapter&lt;/a&gt; 1 of the working group 1 fourth IPCC assessment.

The present uncertainties and research priorities are a different (although related)  question. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2010/06/24/0908906107.abstract&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a paper which surveys experts on the most important uncertainties for future air temperatures. Number one is clouds, which I think few would dispute. Then come ice, water vapour, ocean processes, the carbon cycle and so on.]]></description>

David asks:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I’d like to know the range of proposed mechanisms for solar climatic influence.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

M. Lockwood, C.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Abstract: There is considerable evidence for solar influence on the Earth&#039;s pre-industrial climate and the Sun may well have been a factor in post-industrial climate change in the first half of the last century. Here we show that over the past 20 years, all the trends in the Sun that could have had an influence on the Earth&#039;s climate have been in the opposite direction to that required to explain the observed rise in global mean temperatures.&lt;/blockquote&gt;See Figure 1. there.

Which leads me &lt;i&gt;back to the thread&#039;s main topic:&lt;/i&gt;

There&#039;s a very entertaining source for learning about the science as well as the denial: The video collection &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/user/greenman3610&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Climate Denial Crock of the Week&lt;/a&gt;.

Part of said Fig. 1 appears in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Sf_UIQYc20&#038;feature=channel_page&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Solar Schmolar&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>
