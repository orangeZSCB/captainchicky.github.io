					<description><![CDATA[Well, the real reason some businesses generate more CO2 pollution than others is that they&#039;re the ones delivering the services we pay them for, at the lowest $ cost.  So, it&#039;s the demand for energy services that drives our still growing CO2 pollution. It&#039;s not that businesses offer to provide the service, but our buying it and sending the message to multiply it by doing so.  

The thing we should be really worrying about is our ever growing demand for converting resources into goods and services.   Our economy is designed to remain stable only for conditions of ever growing supply and demand.]]></description>

I spent 15 minutes looking for such a list, and didn&#039;t find one.  A lot of news reports mention &quot;360 businesses&quot;, but no signs of an actual list.  You&#039;d think there might be one here:

&#8226; California Air Resources Board, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/capandtrade/capandtrade.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Cap and Trade&lt;/a&gt;.

but I haven&#039;t seen one.  Lots of good information on how this plan will work, though!]]></description>

I didn&#039;t say I had an &#039;ironclad proof&#039; of anything, nor did I think it.   I agree that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

The mere existence of an unpriced negative spillover effect from one individual to others does not imply that economic efficiency calls for regulating or discouraging the spillover.

So, one needs to examine these things case by case.   

I don&#039;t have time this morning to work out a detailed cost-benefit analysis in the case of global warming.  I do believe that such an analysis would show that a &lt;i&gt;mixture&lt;/i&gt; of Coasean adaptation and Pigouvian taxation is optimal.  But I don&#039;t claim to have a proof of this fact.  Indeed it seems quite hard to &lt;i&gt;prove&lt;/i&gt; anything about public policy.

(By the way, as a mathematician, I hear people proving things all the time, and they never say they have an &#039;ironclad&#039; proof: there&#039;s no need for this hyperbole.

I quite agree that the parallel between sewage systems and CO2 remediation is strained. See my earlier comments. Most of these differences make the sewage system significantly more technically, economically, and politically desirable than CO2 remediation. 

I notice that no one has taken up the earlier point I made due to Coase: The mere existence of an unpriced negative spillover effect from one individual to others does not imply that economic efficiency calls for regulating or discouraging the spillover. Those affected by the spillover could equally well make adjustments to their activities (adaptation) and these adjustments might maximize total welfare. 

I bring this Coasean point up not because economic efficiency is the only value but because John keeps citing the (Pigouvian) externality argument as ironclad proof that CO2 emissions are currently underpriced. But the simple Pigouvian argument is wrong, or at least badly incomplete. Worse, the non-economic-efficiency impacts of Pigouvian regulatory policy can be severe, especially in terms of giving political and bureaucratic leaders power to control and regulate the everyday lives of putatively free citizens, increasing rent-seeking and crony capitalist tendencies in the economy, etc. No classical liberal could be sanguine about such a regime.

The example I gave earlier is quite serious. Does the externality of ugliness in clothing or physiognomy justify Pigouvian remediation? If not, why not? What about the noxious ideas of others, which indeed might cause great harm? Why shouldn&#039;t their expression also be subject to regulation? Personally, I think that people who damage the communicative efficiency of the English language by failing to properly maintain the distinction between &quot;disinterested&quot; and &quot;uninterested&quot; or between &quot;raising the question&quot; and &quot;begging the question&quot; cause real harm to other writers and speakers. Perhaps we can have a Usage Regulatory Commission that assesses fines for such offenses.]]></description>

Hi John, I apologize for seemingly raising a caloric issue. 

My desire was for you to expand on your note that we were experiencing &quot;accelerating rates of resource depletion.&quot; 

As I noted, our non-renewable resources, such as natural gas, are increasing. I&#039;m not seeing &quot;accelerating rates of resource depletion&quot; but quite the opposite. So, I would like to know which resources you can quote the statistics as rapidly diminishing.

Again, I apologize for the confusion.]]></description>

I don&#039;t really understand why you brought up the increase in American&#039;s caloric intake in the first place.  But since you said &quot;please &lt;b&gt;expand&lt;/b&gt;&quot;, I felt like noting that our expanding waistlines are probably related to this increase. 

&lt;img width=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://www.psfk.com/wp-content/uploads/HLIC/fc6591fde41a7be5df69c9b4618369c9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;

  If the average American really consumes 2674 kilocalories a day, that&#039;s pretty scary, since it seems that the recommended allowance &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fatfreekitchen.com/weightloss/weightloss.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;only exceeds this for males aged 15-18&lt;/a&gt; - everyone else should be eating less.]]></description>
