s47, quantum efficiency is of course only one part of overall efficiency, which has been addressed here in every PV discussion. Potentially inexpensive solutions to the efficiency problem made with abundant resources (i.e. silicon) do not exist for the purposes of power generation.

Even with quantum dot rare earths etc., one part of the PV cell efficiency problem is having to use solids. The charge carriers are not just knocked locally from one energy to another - they actually go from one piece of solid to a different piece. Cell anode-cathode geometry is one limiting factor (e.g. if pieces are close enough then some block out).

It seems to me fairly obvious that much higher efficiencies are only possible at the molecular level, i.e. photochemistry in solution rather than photovoltaics. Unfortunately in the context of power generation most photochemical investigations  have focused on funky catalysts for photoelectrolysis.

&lt;blockquote&gt;

I think artificial black holes may not be as feasible as ultimate power sources as (stationary) Alcubierre type warp drives...

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

None of this is terribly relevant to the main thrust of this blog, but I can&#039;t resist saying a few words of clarification for the non-physicists reading this:

The big advantage of artificial black holes is that they can be created according to physics we all believe in, using technology that we can already begin to imagine.  The big disadvantage of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcubierre_drive&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Alcubierre warp drive&lt;/a&gt; is that it can only work if some physical theory that we don&#039;t have any evidence for turns out to be true!  And that shouldn&#039;t be too surprising, given that the Alcubierre warp drive manages to effectively go faster than light (while cleverly not actually doing so, since it bends spacetime as it goes along).  

Here&#039;s what Louis Crane and Shawn Westmoreland &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.1803&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; about artificial black holes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

In a previous paper by the first author, it was proposed that a SBH [subatomic black hole] could be artificially created by firing a huge number of gamma rays from a spherically converging laser. The idea is to pack so much energy into such a small space that a BH will form. An advantage of using photons is that, since they are bosons, there is no Pauli exclusion principle to worry about. Although a laser-powered black hole generator presents huge engineering challenges, the concept appears to be physically sound according to classical general relativity. The Vaidya-Papapetrou metric shows that an imploding spherically symmetric shell of “null dust” can form a black hole (see, e.g., [3], p. 187, or Joshi [10] for further details).

Since photons have null stress energy just like null dust, a black hole should form if a large aggregate of photons interacts classically with the gravitational field. As long as we are discussing regions of spacetime that are many orders of magnitude larger than the Planck length, we should be outside of the regime of quantum gravity and classical theory should be appropriate. However, the assumption of spherical symmetry is rather special, and an investigation into the sensitivity of the process to imperfections in symmetry is an interesting problem for classical general relativity. If a high degree of spherical symmetry is required, then this could pose serious engineering challenges.

Since a nuclear laser can convert on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; of its rest mass to radiation, we would need a lasing mass of order 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; tonnes to produce the pulse. This should correspond to a mass of order 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; tonnes for the whole structure (the size of a small asteroid). Such a structure would be assembled in space near the sun by an army of robots and built out of space-based materials. It is not larger than some structures human beings have already built. The precision required to focus the collapsing electromagnetic wave would be of an order already possible using interferometric methods, but on a truly massive scale.

This is clearly extremely ambitious, but we do not see it as impossible.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Exercise:&lt;/b&gt; work out the details.

Of course, all this is a huge distraction from more pressing problems...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sorry, but a little off topic again.

Regarding biofuels from dedicated crops:

 I wonder if it would be a better use of the land to grow plants for bioplastics.  (or at least some of the land)  
We use something like 5% of oil to make plastics, which create  huge pollution problems like the Pacific gyre garbage patch.  

 The most interesting bioplastics technology I&#039;ve heard about is that used by Metabolix.  Most bioplastics are PLA  or polylactic -acetate. These require several steps of fermentation,distilation, filtering etc.  Most of them require pre heating to about 140 F before they are truly compostable.
 Metabolix makes PHA or Polyhydroxyalkanoates.  These are created using genetically modified bacteria, that turn the sugars into plastic.  Far less steps in this process.  The result is completely compostable plastics, even in the ocean.
Metabolix says they can replace about half the plastics now used. 

http://www.metabolix.com/knowledge/default.aspx?ID=584

They have built a factory in Iowa, in a joint venture with Archer Daniels Midland, that makes bioplastics from corn.  In the future they plan to use non food crops like switchgrass.
  
 Here&#039;s where is really gets interesting.  Metabolix can grow switchgrass with plastic already in the stems and leaves.  The plants have not been genetically modified, just the same bacteria which is inserted at some point, I guess in the germinal stage.
 They have done this under a research grant from the federal govt.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think it is important to look back to Ricardo and find local optimal places for each alternative and then create a global market add mechanisms to existing env trading and also ensure that they connect to the energy grid. The second prerequisite is to agree on an equitable climate solution like the one Pacala presented recently. Then I would choose the best: 

10- wind power as they already are price competitive with fossil fuel, and the same as price as nuclear. 11- PV (GaAs) and the multijunction cells and peek at safe nano films. Plus integrated design building solutions. The economy is a problem right now but its not that far from mass production so ill think it  will happen without gov incentives. but gov has to fund storage research in a big way as this is sorely neglected and it can be reused in other energy transforms plus that it achieves utilization gains. 

9 Nuclear fission somewhere in between, because at least where I live they are falling to pieces if nothing is done and David MacKay says if we create U23x non-depletion commitments (eg consumtion rate to last 1000 years globally)  at least its a stop gap solution to do seriously needed &quot;maintenance&quot; or tech. upgrade. then we can potentially get a 4 fold increase in stations, iff we can harvest ocean and rivers for U23x. But I would waste problem solved before promoting nuclear further. All storage today is temporary and no one has worked out a satisfying permanent solution (well maybe the italian maffia who allegedly have dumped nuclear waste in the Mediterranean)
 
13 - big no-no as long as there is no until we have artifical photosynthesis that ensures that the existing biomass is untouched.]]></description>

I can&#039;t tell if I&#039;m living inside a black hole or not. Sorry, off topic, but one of my family&#039;s (and then friends&#039;) favorite memes is &quot;I can&#039;t tell if I&#039;m ___ or not&quot;. Almost anything put in the blank is funny and sometimes thought provoking.

It was inspired by my young son years ago fighting with a boy, and the other boy said &quot;I can&#039;t tell if I&#039;m bleeding or not&quot; while trying to find physical evidence on himself to justify crying. I was approaching to punish them for fighting, but wound up rolling on the ground laughing too hard.

I think artificial black holes may not be as feasible as ultimate power sources as (stationary) Alcubierre type warp drives
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcubierre_drive
Exotic matter is not actually needed if conformal gravity is demanded, and of course those conformal terms yield dark energy effects etc. Maybe only a tithe of the Earth&#039;s resources and population, for maybe only a millenium, and we could see some real progress on the warp drive.

Usually I think nothing meaningful will be done about *stopping* climate change, so resources would be better spent on responding to it happening. Realistic technological solutions all must involve gigantic geoengineering (or climate engineering) projects, but as a species we can&#039;t even get our act together to spray a little ocean water to obviate local droughts (partly via the Twomey effect).]]></description>

No physicists in their right minds really thought the Large Hadron Collider would make microscopic black holes.  However, not all physicists are in their right minds!  

My friend Louis Crane has proposed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fqxi.org/data/essay-contest-files/Crane_essay.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt; artificial black holes&lt;/a&gt; as the ultimate power source.  In principle it should work.   But as he concedes, &quot;This proposal is extremely difficult technically.&quot;  

I expect it could take a few centuries if technological progress proceeds at about the current rate.  (That&#039;s a big &quot;if&quot;.)  It seems extremely unlikely that we&#039;ll be able to do it in time to stop global warming.]]></description>

<p>My friend Louis Crane has proposed <a href="http://www.fqxi.org/data/essay-contest-files/Crane_essay.pdf" rel="nofollow"> artificial black holes</a> as the ultimate power source.  In principle it should work.   But as he concedes, &#8220;This proposal is extremely difficult technically.&#8221;  </p>
<p>I expect it could take a few centuries if technological progress proceeds at about the current rate.  (That&#8217;s a big &#8220;if&#8221;.)  It seems extremely unlikely that we&#8217;ll be able to do it in time to stop global warming.</p>

It seems a little weird only to be listing technologies that are currently viable on large scales when we’re talking about 50 years out.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That&#039;s an interesting point. 

First &#8212; and I&#039;d forgotten to mention this! &#8212; the point of Pacala and Socolow&#039;s paper is to prove that we can do it with existing technologies.  Their paper is called &quot;Stabilization wedges: solving the climate problem for the next 50 years with current technologies.&quot;  And the first paragraph reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The debate in the current literature about stabilizing atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at less than a doubling of the preindustrial concentration has led to needless confusion about current options for mitigation. On one side, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has claimed that “technologies that exist in operation or pilot stage today” are sufficient to follow a less-than-doubling
trajectory “over the next hundred years or more”. On the other side, a recent review in &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt; asserts that the IPCC claim demonstrates “misperceptions of technological
readiness” and calls for “revolutionary
changes” in mitigation technology, such as fusion, space-based solar electricity, and artificial photosynthesis. We agree that fundamental research is vital to develop the revolutionary mitigation strategies needed in the second half of this century and beyond. But it is important not to become beguiled by the possibility of revolutionary technology. Humanity can solve the carbon and climate problem in the first half of this century simply by scaling up what we already know how to do.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Second, I&#039;ve heard it said that the time it takes to scale up energy technologies is too slow, and climate change is happening too quick, for us &lt;i&gt;wait&lt;/i&gt; for a technological &#039;silver bullet&#039;.   According to this view, while we may need to develop new technologies to save ourselves, we &lt;i&gt;also&lt;/i&gt; need to proceed full-speed with the technologies at hand.

Given the uncertainties involved, one could also argue that whether or not it turns out to be necessary, it&#039;s simply &lt;i&gt;prudent&lt;/i&gt; to proceed full-speed with the technologies at hand.]]></description>
