					<description><![CDATA[In explaining ENSO, I think an important element was not covered in your essay.

It&#039;s the topographic set up, namely the presence of the mountains of the Indonesian archipelago and other islands/land masses of the so called maritime continent. This is what enhances the convection activity over there (roughly speaking most of global surface air is pushed higher in the troposphere right there), making eastward wind in the tropical Pacific stronger then without Indonesia.

This is the first element in the build up of warm water in the western Pacific, leading to the potential energy distribution disequilibrium.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[John,

Nice piece, as you would know this cycle greatly influences our rainfall on the othe side of the Pacific.

Hear in Victoria, aus, we&#039;ve just broken a 12 year drought, with the proverbial flooding rains, resulting from a combination of La Nina, STR, IOD all coordinating to their wetter modes (last happened in 1975).

Good to see you&#039;re trying to explain these issues at a level that most can comprehend. Some collegues of mine have developed a series of animations you may be interested in. They resulted from many years of experience in trying to explain weather and climate issues to farmers through our extension work, hence the cattle dogs. Much less detailed but explain the drivers that affect our local rainfall, and targeted to a specific audience.

Hope you enjoy.

					<description><![CDATA[The driver is the temperature of the water itself.  It circulates in a loop east-west at the surface and then west-east under the surface in the Cromwell Current or the Pacific Equatorial Undercurrent.

This loop ca ntake up to 2 years to complete and will then oscillate warm and cold based on the last ENSO event.  Last year&#039;s El Nino is now in the loop at 150 metres depth between 130E and 175E and will make it to the surface at the Galapagos Islands in about 6 months and the next El Nino will start.

The water that is surfacing in the loop in the East Pacific is the driver of the Trade Winds, the cloudiness, the OLR, the water vapour and everything associated with the ENSO.

Upper Ocean Temps 155W to 80W versus the Trade Winds

Upper Ocean Temps 180W to 100W lead these by a few months.

I can show the same correlation with just about every climate index associated with the ENSO.
 
You can see the loop in these animations.

					<description><![CDATA[Interesting problem!   Quite often a complex oscillation, which this looks more like than a string of separate events, is the result of two different through-put processes needing to alternately occupy the same flow channel.   An example is the gurgling of liquid from a bottle, with the opening needing to be alternately used by liquid and air in return.   

I&#039;m not saying it&#039;s that particular one, but that alternating processes will often build up reserve potential or &quot;pent up demand&quot; while the other is relieving theirs.   That results in an on/off switch type behavior when exchanging roles.]]></description>

This explains a lot...of course the Germans in 1914 set out to teach the world their way of living for its own good (&quot;am deutschen Wesen soll die Welt genesen&quot;), instead of finding some place to relax. Little did they know that all of their endeavors that would be of any interest a century later would be the accidential disruption of barometer readings.

Several generations later German writer Heinrich Böll (Nobel laureate) would make fun of this attitude with his &quot;anecdote to lower the working morale&quot;, about the encounter of a tourist (a German, I bet) and a fisherman:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

The fisherman is happily hanging out at the shore and just relaxing in the sun. The tourists asks if he has already done his fishing to which the fisherman replies “yes”.  He says he caught a lot, so he’s happy. The tourist then goes to pontificate about how if he would go out again - instead of lazing around - and catch even more he’d be able to have employees in the future, get his own fleet of helicopters, a fish factory and build his own Franchise restaurant.

So the fisherman asks him: “Why would I want to do that?” – The tourists says:”So that you get rich, have a happy life and someday may even have enough spare time to lie and relax in the sun.” To which the fisherman replies: “But look, this is what I’m already doing right now.”

&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We&#039;re having some interesting conversations about the El Ni&#241;o/Southern Oscillation over on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Mathforge/Azimuth/comments.php?DiscussionID=169&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Azimuth Forum&lt;/a&gt;.  Unfortunately discussions on the forum, not being visible here on the blog, may fool the customers here into thinking less is happening in the Azimuth universe than really is!   So, I may try to transfer some of the discussion over here.

Here, for example, is an interesting comment by Graham Jones:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

I think the ENSO is like a violin! When the bow is drawn across a string, it pulls it for a while, and then the string slips back a bit, only to be caught by the bow again. So the bow is like the trade winds, and the greater friction between bow and string when they are moving together is like the positive feedback between the warm water piling up in the West and the winds. When the warm water slips back towards the East, you get an El Nino!

The time scales are different (ms vs years) and so are the distances (mm vs 10,000km) - in both cases the ratio is about 10&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;. The bow against string makes a characteristic &#039;sawtooth&#039; vibration: can you see this shape in the graphs of ocean temperature and SOI?   ;-)

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I have no idea if any mechanism of this sort is relevant to the ENSO, but the idea of water being dragged by wind and then slipping could have some truth to it... with the added complexity that the &#039;slipping&#039; is enhanced by &lt;i&gt;feedback&lt;/i&gt; in the manner I described.  

Anyway, you&#039;re reminding me of &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week151.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;week151&lt;/a&gt;, which is when I first learned how a violin bow works:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
... here&#039;s a cool article on violins:

&lt;p&gt;
1) Colin Gough, Science and the Stradivarius, &lt;i&gt;Physics World&lt;/i&gt;, vol. 13 no. 4, April 2000, 27-33.

Before reading this, I never knew how a string on a violin vibrates! Lots of well-known European physicists have studied the violin, and in the 19th century, Helmholtz showed that the bow excites a mode of the violin string that is quite unlike the sine waves we all know and love. In this &#034;Helmholtz waveform&#034;, the string consists of two straight-line segments separated by a kink:

&lt;pre&gt;
                         .   
                    .       .
               .               .
          .                       .

&lt;/pre&gt;

As time passes, the kink travels back and forth along the string, being reflected at the ends.  The beauty of this becomes apparent as we watch the string right at the point where the bow is rubbing over it, near the bottom end of the string.  When the kink is between the bow and the top
end of the string:

&lt;pre&gt;
                            bow
                             &#124;
                             ^
                         .   &#124;
   TOP               .      .&#124;          BOTTOM
               .             &#124; .
          .                  &#124;    .
                             &#124;
                             &#124;


&lt;/pre&gt;
this point in the string moves at the same speed and in the same direction  as the bow.  This is called the &#034;sticking regime&#034;, because the static friction of the rosin-coated bow is enough to pull the string along with it.  But when the kink moves past the bow:

&lt;pre&gt;
                            &#124;
                            ^

the string slips off the bow and starts moving in the opposite direction to it.   This is called the &#034;sliding regime&#034;.  Since the coefficient of sliding friction is less than the coefficient of static friction, the string can slide against the motion of the bow in this regime.

The really nice thing is that the string is vibrating almost freely: the violinist just needs to apply the right amount of pressure to keep this vibrational mode excited - too much pressure will ruin it!  Being able to delicately control the Helmholtz waveform is part of what distinguishes 
the virtuoso from the blood-curdling amateur.

The full physics of the violin is infinitely more complicated than this, of course.  The vibrating string excites the bridge which excites the sound box, and &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; produces most of the sound we hear.  For more information try these:

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re having some interesting conversations about the El Ni&ntilde;o/Southern Oscillation over on the <a href="http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Mathforge/Azimuth/comments.php?DiscussionID=169" rel="nofollow">Azimuth Forum</a>.  Unfortunately discussions on the forum, not being visible here on the blog, may fool the customers here into thinking less is happening in the Azimuth universe than really is!   So, I may try to transfer some of the discussion over here.</p>
<p>Here, for example, is an interesting comment by Graham Jones:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think the ENSO is like a violin! When the bow is drawn across a string, it pulls it for a while, and then the string slips back a bit, only to be caught by the bow again. So the bow is like the trade winds, and the greater friction between bow and string when they are moving together is like the positive feedback between the warm water piling up in the West and the winds. When the warm water slips back towards the East, you get an El Nino!</p>
<p>The time scales are different (ms vs years) and so are the distances (mm vs 10,000km) &#8211; in both cases the ratio is about 10<sup></sup><sup>10</sup>. The bow against string makes a characteristic &#8216;sawtooth&#8217; vibration: can you see this shape in the graphs of ocean temperature and SOI?   ;-)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have no idea if any mechanism of this sort is relevant to the ENSO, but the idea of water being dragged by wind and then slipping could have some truth to it&#8230; with the added complexity that the &#8216;slipping&#8217; is enhanced by <i>feedback</i> in the manner I described.  </p>
<p>Anyway, you&#8217;re reminding me of <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week151.html" rel="nofollow">week151</a>, which is when I first learned how a violin bow works:</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8230; here&#8217;s a cool article on violins:</p>
<p>
1) Colin Gough, Science and the Stradivarius, <i>Physics World</i>, vol. 13 no. 4, April 2000, 27-33.</p>
<p>Before reading this, I never knew how a string on a violin vibrates! Lots of well-known European physicists have studied the violin, and in the 19th century, Helmholtz showed that the bow excites a mode of the violin string that is quite unlike the sine waves we all know and love. In this &quot;Helmholtz waveform&quot;, the string consists of two straight-line segments separated by a kink:</p>
<pre>
                         .   
                    .       .
               .               .
          .                       .

</pre>
<p>As time passes, the kink travels back and forth along the string, being reflected at the ends.  The beauty of this becomes apparent as we watch the string right at the point where the bow is rubbing over it, near the bottom end of the string.  When the kink is between the bow and the top<br />
end of the string:</p>
<pre>
                            bow
                             |
                             ^
                         .   |
   TOP               .      .|          BOTTOM
               .             | .
          .                  |    .
                             |
                             |


</pre>
<p>this point in the string moves at the same speed and in the same direction  as the bow.  This is called the &quot;sticking regime&quot;, because the static friction of the rosin-coated bow is enough to pull the string along with it.  But when the kink moves past the bow:</p>
<pre>
                            |
                            ^
                            |  .
                         .  | 
   TOP              .       |   .     BOTTOM
               .            | 
          .                 |    .
                            |
</pre>
<p>the string slips off the bow and starts moving in the opposite direction to it.   This is called the &quot;sliding regime&quot;.  Since the coefficient of sliding friction is less than the coefficient of static friction, the string can slide against the motion of the bow in this regime.</p>
<p>The really nice thing is that the string is vibrating almost freely: the violinist just needs to apply the right amount of pressure to keep this vibrational mode excited &#8211; too much pressure will ruin it!
