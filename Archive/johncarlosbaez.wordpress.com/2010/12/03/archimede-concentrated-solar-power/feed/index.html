Pres.O was amusing asking them to reexamine the myth, but the Mythbusters did not choose poor approach to resolving it. Flat mirrors are almost impossible to focus to the point where they would burn cloth or wood, so where would Arch get the idea. Greek shields were concave not flat like the Roman shields, which is how a polished shield might have accidentally set something on fire, which is the mostly likely way he might have made an observation that might of lead it to try this. I was disappointed that the M people didn&#039;t spend some time thinking like a bright high school students and tried to use a mirror might burn wood up close, and then determine if it were possible to try to accomplish the myth at a distance. Pres.O seems to be trying to hard to promote science in junior high school and higher in the USA now. By the way, he gave a very nice talk five min talk about the importance of science to the future before he handed out the National Medal of Science. You can find videos of both appearances on the white house website.]]></description>

The current definition of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_%28Internet%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;trolling&lt;/a&gt; seems to focus on quite nasty ways that people use the internet to make other people upset.

But back when the internet was young, before the web was invented, trolling was often more benign.  On so-called usenet newsgroups, people would make absurd claims with a straight face, just for the pleasure of tricking people into taking them seriously and arguing with them.

For example, I once claimed (in some usenet newsgroup where nobody knew me) that just as &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio#Egyptian_pyramids&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the Egyptians had secretly built the golden ratio into the dimensions of the pyramids&lt;/a&gt; (a controversial claim), the Babylonians had &lt;i&gt;secretly built the number pi into their architecture&lt;/i&gt;: a Babylonian column had been unearthed where the ratio of the circumference to the diameter was almost equal to pi!  I was roundly denounced as an idiot until somebody pointed out that I was a mathematician and must have been kidding..   That was precisely what I wanted.   That&#039;s &quot;trolling&quot;.

Similarly, I can imagine someone reading this blog article and posting an absurd comment claiming that Mythbusters was about to test whether Archimedes could have set those ships on fire.... &lt;i&gt;at the insistence of President Obama!&lt;/i&gt;

So, I thought you were trolling.  But it turned out you were serious.

By the way, I haven&#039;t watched the show.  What happened?]]></description>

Yea, with complicated things I can never check figures unless I start over with the concept too.   I&#039;m using IEA World indicators time series data. My copy is linked from the references noted on that page, at:  http://www.synapse9.com/design/IEA-worldindicators.xlsx 

The GDP difference seems due to my using PPP dollars which effectively corrects the currency fluctuations for physical productivity, and gives that nice smooth GDP curve and matching smooth Energy use curve (fig 1).

As to your question, &quot;What does it mean...  Surely it doesn’t take this much energy for me to produce a dollar of goods or services!&quot;.   I got: 8000 btu/sec = 8443528 joules/sec, so 8.4 million in 2008.  So yes, that is exactly what it means, the total purchased energy the world was using in 2008, on average, to produce $1 of GDP.

I&#039;m not sure about your last calculation, but the rest seems OK except that I&#039;m using 7500 Watts per sq meter per month from the charts of measured solar radiation at the ground referred to.  I don&#039;t know if the world average for mid-latitudes is somewhat above or below, to that&#039;s just a sample number.

The price energy is sold at is a quite different thing, and solar is generally subsidized to compete with oil, etc, so may be hard to gage.  The $1 price the GDP value of using the 8000btu&#039;s at the efficiency of the world economy.  What I&#039;m saying is that the value to the economy of using 8000btu or 8.4Mjoules, on average, is 1$.  

What happens is when you compare these figures (shares of global energy implied) with traceable energy uses for businesses to operate, the averages are generally greater than the traceable energy uses, often a difference of 500% or more.  So, some untraced energy use seem to go uncounted. 

fyi - I have a long paper on the subject that&#039;ll be in an upcoming issue of Sustainability (MDPI) fyi: http://www.synapse9.com/drafts/WindEROI_SEA.pdf   There appears to be a fascinating cognitive error in the ISO standards used for designing measures business environmental impacts!  Read the abstract and a couple pages and see what you think.

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/12/03/archimede-concentrated-solar-power/#comment-2957&quot;&gt;Phil Henshaw&lt;/a&gt;.

I find it a bit tough to follow these calculations.  Let me try to redo some of them, sticking to metric as much as possible.

The earth receives about 150 watts/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Solar+radiation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;solar radiation&lt;/a&gt;, averaging over location and time of day (including night!).  

You use a different figure...

But following you, I&#039;ll multiply by figure by 0.19 since solar cells aren&#039;t perfectly efficient, and by 0.5 assuming only half the ground gets covered, and by 5/6 assuming an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Energy+return+on+energy+invested&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;energy return on energy invested&lt;/a&gt; of 6.  

This brings it down to about 12 watts/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

Then you do a conversion from energy to GDP, which people might argue about: you say that in 2008, the world GDP was about 64 trillion dollars, and the world energy consumption was about 512,000 quadrillion BTU.  I like metric, so I&#039;ll convert that to 5.4 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; joules. 

Hmm, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_energy_resources_and_consumption&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; says the world used 4.7 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; joules in 2008.  That&#039;s 3 orders of magnitude off!

Where are you getting your figure of 512285 quadrillion BTU?  Your &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.synapse9.com/design/dollarshadow.htm#t3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;table 3&lt;/a&gt; doesn&#039;t go up to 2008, but it seems to say that in 2007 the total energy use was about 477 quadrillion BTU.  Again, that&#039;s about 3 orders of magnitude off.  

Did you perhaps mean 512.285 quadrillion BTU?  If I use that figure I get about 8000 BTU per dollar of GDP, which matches your figure.  

Okay, so you left out the decimal point in your table but it didn&#039;t really affect the next step in your calculation.  

Let me redo it my way. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; gives a world GDP of $57 trillion in 2009, which is at least roughly consistent with your $64 trillion in 2008.  (Did it go down due to the financial crisis?)

So, I&#039;ll use your figure of $64 trillion GDP and the Wikipedia figure of  4.7 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; joules in 2008, and get 7.3 million joules per dollar GDP.

Before I proceed, I have to ask, what does this figure of &quot;7.3 million joules per dollar GDP&quot; really mean?  Surely it doesn&#039;t take this much energy for me to produce a dollar of goods or services!  

But I guess you&#039;re claiming it &lt;i&gt;does?&lt;/i&gt;

Anyway, to finish off the calculation, if one dollar GDP equals 7.3 million joules in some mysterious sense, and solar power brings in 12 watts/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, then in some mysterious sense solar power brings in &quot;one dollar per second per 6 million square meters.&quot;

But surely people building solar power plants earn a lot more than that from the power they sell!  

So I guess I&#039;ll ask you again: what does &quot;7.3 million joules per dollar GDP&quot; really mean?  ]]></description>

Hi, I&#039;m curious if any of you would concur with my calculation of the size of a 19% efficiency PV array with 7500 Wh/sq meter radiation, to generate the average amount of energy to deliver $1 of GDP?   

What I get is 1300sf for a day on average.   So for your $6 glass of wine as average spending you&#039;d need the equivalent of 7800sf of PV array?, and for your $50k income, the use of a 180,000sf array every day.

Thanks, Ali!  I spent the morning learning about solar power.  I added your information to 

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Concentrated+solar+power&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Concentrated solar power&lt;/a&gt;, Azimuth.

and also a long-needed new page:

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Photovoltaic+solar+power&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Photovoltaic solar power&lt;/a&gt;, Azimuth.

Here&#039;s what I wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

As of 2009, photovoltaic solar power generated 21 gigawatts of power, a very small fraction of the roughly 4500 GW total global power-generating capacity from all sources (need exact figure!).  However, between 2004 and 2009, the amount of photovoltaic solar power being generated &lt;b&gt;increased at an annual average rate of 60 percent&lt;/b&gt;:

&#8226; REN21, Renewables 2010 Global Status Report, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ren21.net/Portals/97/documents/GSR/REN21_GSR_2010_full_revised%20Sept2010.pdf#page=19&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;page 29&lt;/a&gt;

Quoting from this report:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

Cumulative global PV installations are now nearly &lt;b&gt;six times what they were at the end of 2004&lt;/b&gt;. Analysts expect even &lt;b&gt;higher growth in the next four to five years&lt;/b&gt;. Thin film’s share of the global market increased from 14 percent in 2008 to 19 percent in 2009 for cells, and from 16 to 22 percent for modules.

Germany again became the primary driver of PV installations, more than making up for the Spanish gap with 3.8 GW added &#8212; about 54 percent of the global market. This was far above Spain’s prior record-breaking addition of 2.4 GW in 2008, and brought Germany’s capacity to 9.8 GW by the end of 2009, amounting to 47 percent of existing global solar PV capacity.  While Germany has played a major role in advancing PV and driving down costs, its importance will decline as other countries step up their demand and reduce the industry’s reliance on a single market.

After its record-breaking year in 2008, the Spanish PV market plummeted to an estimated 70 MW added in 2009, due to a cap on subsidies after the national solar target was exceeded. But there were other sunny spots in Europe. Italy came in a distant second after Germany, installing 710 MW and more than doubling its 2008 additions due to high feed-in tariffs and a good national solar resource; such strong growth is expected to continue. Japan reemerged as a serious player, coming in third with 485 MW installed after reinstating residential rebates and introducing a buyback program for residential rooftop systems.

The United States added an estimated 470 MW of solar PV in 2009, including 40 MW of off-grid PV, bringing cumulative capacity above the 1 GW mark. California accounted for about half of the total, followed by New Jersey with 57 MW added; several other states are expected to pass the 50 MW per year mark in the near future. Residential installations came to 156 MW, a doubling from 2008 thanks in part to removal of the $2,000 cap on the federal Investment Tax Credit and to a 10 percent drop in installed costs relative to 2008.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;California &lt;/h4&gt;

The First Solar Agua Caliente photovoltaic power plant, with an 290 megawatt alternating current rating, is slated to be the single largest solar generating plant in the world when it starts up in 2013.    Located 65 miles east of the city of Yuma on the former White Wing Ranch, the Agua Caliente Solar Project will produce sufficient electricity to power about 100,000 average homes per year, displacing approximately 220,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year &#8212; the equivalent of taking about 40,000 cars off the road.

I added information about the Sahara Solar Breeder Project to our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Solar+breeder&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Solar breeder page&lt;/a&gt;.  Here&#039;s what I wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
More recently, the following institutions in Japan:

&#8226; University of Tokyo 

&#8226; Hirosaki University 

&#8226; National Institute for Material Science 

&#8226; Tokyo Institute of Technology

&#8226; Chubu University

&#8226; National Institute of Informatics

have teamed up with the Universit&#233; des Sciences et la Technologie d&#039;Oran (USTO) in Algeria, and launched a joint initiative called the &lt;b&gt;Sahara Solar Energy Research Center&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;b&gt;SSERC&lt;/b&gt;).  Commonly called the &lt;b&gt;Sahara Solar Breeder Project&lt;/b&gt;, its self-proclaimed incredibly ambitious goal is to &quot;build enough solar power stations by 2050 to supply 50 per cent of the energy used by humanity&quot;.  The plan is to build a solar breeder in the Sahara desert, and convert sand there to silicon wafers used in solar panels:

&#8226; Michael Fitzpatrick, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn19785-sun-and-sand-breed-sahara-solar-power.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sun and sand breed Sahara solar power&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;New Scientist&lt;/i&gt;, 30 November 2010.

The project appears to be led by &lt;a href=&quot;http://t2r2.star.titech.ac.jp/cgi-bin/researcherinfo.cgi?lv=en&#038;q_researcher_content_number=CTT100381909&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Hideomi Koinuma&lt;/a&gt; from the Science Council of Japan, who proposed the idea at the 2009 G8+5 Academies&#039; Meeting in Rome:

&#8226; G8+5 Academies&#039; Meeting; Rome, 26 - 27 March 2009, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.g8italia2009.it/static/G8_Allegato/Programma_G8+5,2.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Programme&lt;/a&gt;, Accademia Nazionale de Lincei.

Despite many news reports on this project, details seem hard to find, so it is difficult to tell how seriously to take it.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Does anyone here know more?&lt;/b&gt;]]></description>

I started a page on solar energy based on what streamfortyseven told us:

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/solar+energy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Solar energy&lt;/a&gt;, Azimuth Project. 

It&#039;s just a stub so far, and I bet streamfortyseven could &lt;i&gt;easily&lt;/i&gt; make it ten times better in half an hour.  (Don&#039;t worry about getting the formatting right; the elves will take care of that.)

I&#039;m sure it&#039;s obvious to all of you, but converting bauxite ore into aluminum takes a lot more energy than melting aluminum cans to recycle them.  Aluminum is highly reactive.  This is why the pure metal form was isolated so late &#8212; 1825.  And this is why Napoleon let his guests use gold forks and knives, while reserving the more precious &lt;i&gt;aluminum&lt;/i&gt; cutlery for himself!  Little did he know how tacky this would later seem.

So, I&#039;d like to see a solar-powered system melt rock and make aluminum!]]></description>
