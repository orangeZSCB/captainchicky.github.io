					<description><![CDATA[Yes, i did spend some time playing, that game was a little addictive, to me at least.

I&#039;m very glad to be of help. In any case those are the kind of simulations i can build and run in about 5 minutes, so it&#039;s no problem, and besides, it&#039;s fun.

I&#039;m glad you are enjoying Vietnam, sounds fascinating. The part of Italy where I am from (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apulia) also has a long story of being invaded by everyone and their sisters, but we didn&#039;t really bother to fight back, except in a few cases.]]></description>

It sounds like a fun game, and it sounds like you &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; spend a lot of time playing it, against your own advice.  

I&#039;m very glad you&#039;re helping Tim figure out the right amount of noise per time-step for that stochastic differential equation.  I would join in, but I only have limited access to the computer in the hotel lobby here in Hue!  

Vietnam is a fascinating place.  They&#039;ve been attacked many times: most recently by the Americans, and before that by the French, but more often by the Chinese.  So, everything old is damaged or destroyed.  But they kept fighting back, so they&#039;re still here, and now they are struggling very hard to advance themselves economically.  There&#039;s a lot of pollution, a lot of motorbikes driving all over the place, and a lot of poor people, but also a lot of energy.  The United States seems like a very sleepy place, in comparison.]]></description>

I take it back, I have finally won today, which basically means that i got to the year 2120 with less than 3 degrees increment without destroying civilization. I mean, Latin America has to be rebuilt and there&#039;s war raging in China, but other than that, it&#039;s an excellent result :-)

Anyway, i am not sure how accurate are the underlying climate and economics models (this is the successor of the BBC climate challenge game), but they seem to have at least a decent level of detail (and it is really fun to play).]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If all the ice in Greenland were to melt, it would cause an additional sea level rise of 7.2 meters. If all the ice in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet were to melt, it would cause a further rise of 4.8 meters. Of course we don’t expect these to completely melt in the next century — but they’re melting faster than people expected when the last IPCC report was written, so there’s a lot of uncertainty here. I haven’t seen any good guesses.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Actually there&#039;s some information on the Azimuth Project &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Sea+level+risehttp://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Sea+level+rise&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;sea level rise&lt;/a&gt; page.  It looks like the current range of estimates point to 0.6-2 meters of sea level rise by 2010.  So, we could easily see about 10-18 million people in Bangladesh needing to move to higher ground.

First, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/The+Copenhagen+Diagnosis&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Copenhagen Diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;, written in 2009, was intended to serve as an interim evaluation of the evolving science before the 5th IPCC report, which is not due for completion until 2013.   Its executive summary says, among other things:

&#8226; &lt;b&gt;Current sea-level rise underestimates:&lt;/b&gt; Satellites show great global average sea-level rise (3.4 mm/yr over the past 15 years) to be 80% above past IPCC predictions. This acceleration in sea-level rise is consistent with a doubling in contribution from melting of glaciers, ice caps and the Greenland and West- Antarctic ice-sheets.

&#8226; &lt;b&gt;Sea-level prediction revised:&lt;/b&gt; By 2100, global sea-level is likely to rise at least twice as much as projected by Working Group 1 of the IPCC AR4, for unmitigated emissions it may well exceed 1 meter. The upper limit has been estimated as 2 meters sea-level rise by 2100. Sea-level will continue to rise for centuries after global temperature have been stabilized and several meters of sea level rise must be expected over the next few centuries.

Second, this is a paper which aims to estimate the sea level rise with a greater variety of factors included in the analysis than is generally done:

&#8226; S. Jevrejeva, J. C. Moore and A. Grinsted, How will sea level respond to changes in natural and anthropogenic forcings by 2100?, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.agu.org/journals/ABS/2010/2010GL042947.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Geophysical Research Letters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;37&lt;/b&gt; (2010), L07703.

The authors say their estimates are in line with past sea level responses to temperature change, and they suggest that estimates based on ice and ocean thermal responses alone may be misleading.  With six different IPCC radiative forcing scenarios they estimate a sea level rise of 0.6–1.6 m, and are confident the rise will be between 0.59 m and 1.8 m.]]></description>

As usual, it was more fun to talk about areas of disagreement.  But they&#039;re good points. 

You&#039;re right that people are more drawn to seashores than earthquake-prone regions, and this needs to be taken into account.

I consider Pielke Jr. to be an intelligent man with a bit of an axe to grind.  I thought that Munich Re, being in the business of insurance, would know a thing or two about the risks we face.  But since it also has interests at stake here, as you point out, that means I can&#039;t trust them either.  This is typical of the puzzles I&#039;m trying to solve these days: we can&#039;t always trust &quot;experts&quot;, we have to do real work to sort out the data, and we have to constantly be on guard against getting locked into an ideology that filters all the data we receive, giving us preconceived results.  &quot;Both sides&quot; in the climate change debate &#8212; though surely there are more than two &#8212; are extremely susceptible to this ideological filtering.

					<description><![CDATA[Munich Re says: &quot;The rise in natural catastrophe losses is primarily due to socio-economic factors. In many countries, populations are rising, and more and more people moving into exposed areas. At the same time, greater prosperity is leading to higher property values. Nevertheless, it would seem that the only plausible explanation for the rise in weather-related catastrophes is climate change. The view that weather extremes are more frequent and intense due to global warming coincides with the current state of scientific knowledge as set out in the Fourth IPCC Assessment Report.&quot;

Pielke Jr. has worked on this a lot, as have others. Most conclude that in the US, at least, all the increases in payouts are due to socioeconomic factors. 

(Note that the economic interests of Munich Re are heavily tilted to getting us to mitigate CO2, on the off-chance that that reduces their payouts. Insurance firms are equally biased in favor of expensive auto-safety features that may not provide net benefit to consumers.)

Munich Re further argues: &quot;For me the most convincing piece of evidence that global warming has been contributing already to more and more intense weather related natural catastrophes is the fact that while we find a steep increase in the number of loss relevant weather events (about tripling in the last 30 years&#062; we only find a slight increase in geophysical (earthquake, volcano, tsunami) events, which should not be affected by global warming. If the whole trend we find in weather related disaster should be caused by reporting bias, or socio-demographic or economic developments we would expect to find it similarly for the geophysical events.&quot;

This argument is incorrect. Economic development has led to people moving to desirable areas, like coastlines, not to volcanos or earthquake zones. And since earthquake events follow a power law, we may well be seeing a &quot;black swan&quot; effect where The Big One in California will swamp all other disaster costs in one shot.

Finally, I&#039;m surprised you didn&#039;t respond to my two points that 1) we have other disaster scenarios to invest against that are likely much more serious (e.g. earthquakes) and 2) most of the adaptive  responses should take place at a sub-national level. CO2 mitigation naturally works best at a supranational level, adaptation at a sub-national one. Instead we have California attempting CO2 mitigation and the national government encouraging people to live in flood-prone areas through subsidized insurance. Wacky.]]></description>

My point about US migration patterns is that within sample there isn’t a lot of evidence that people like it colder. These migratory movements subject people to much greater than 2 degree temperature increases. If US agricultural productivity increases and US winters become milder and more people get to live in climates more like the ones that people are already moving toward, then the US is not going to be ravaged too much by the projected warming. (Not saying other countries don’t matter, but I don’t know enough about India and Africa to judge the claims about harm to them.)

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If global warming simply meant that every day were 2 &#176;C warmer (3.6 &#176;F for folks in the US) than it would have been, it probably wouldn&#039;t matter a lot to most people.  

Even sea level rise would have limited impact in most parts of the United States.   It matters a lot more in Bangladesh, where according to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.unep.org/dewa/vitalwater/article146.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;UNEP&lt;/a&gt;, 1.5 meters in sea level rise would displace 18 million people:

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Worldwide, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/NRC+climate+stabilization+targets&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;National Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt; estimates that a mere 0.6 meter sea level rise would displace 3 million people and raise the risk of flood for millions more.  They expect at least this amount of sea level rise by 2010, due to thermal expansion and loss of ice from glaciers and small ice caps.  

This estimate doesn&#039;t count the big unknown factor: Greenland and the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.   If all the ice in Greenland were to melt, it would cause an additional sea level rise of 7.2 meters.  If all the ice in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet were to melt, it would cause a further rise of 4.8 meters.  Of course we don&#039;t expect these to completely melt in the next century &#8212; but they&#039;re melting faster than people expected when the last IPCC report was written, so there&#039;s a lot of uncertainty here. I haven&#039;t seen any good guesses.

In the short term, say 20 years or so, I think the main economic damage from global warming will come from weather-related disasters.  It&#039;s not the 2 &#176;C average temperature rise that&#039;s the problem: it&#039;s the rise in extreme weather events!  

You may remember how Russia &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/06/world/europe/06russia.html?_r=1&#038;hp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;banned wheat exports&lt;/a&gt; this year due to a crop failure brought on by an unprecedented heat wave.  You may also remember the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Pakistan_floods&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;massive floods in Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;, which caused structural damages of about $4 billion, and crop losses of about $500 million &#8212; as well as lot of other economic havoc.  You may not have heard about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/40420039/ns/us_news-environment/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;exceptional drought in the Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, even worse than the &quot;once-in-a-century&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6484073.stm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;drought of 2005&lt;/a&gt;.  

All these seem to be part of a trend toward increased weather variability, which is what I&#039;d expect from a hotter, more energetic atmosphere and ocean.  Munich Re, one of the world&#039;s largest reinsurers, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.munichre.com/en/media_relations/press_releases/2010/2010_09_27_press_release.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;wrote in September 2010&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

Floods in central Europe, wildfires in Russia, widespread flooding in Pakistan. The number and scale of weather-related natural catastrophe losses in the first nine months of 2010 was exceptionally high….  Munich Re emphasises the probability of a link between the increasing number of weather extremes and climate change.

    Globally, 2010 has been the warmest year since records began over 130 years ago, the ten warmest during that period all falling within the last 12 years. The warmer atmosphere and higher sea temperatures are having significant effects. Prof. Peter Höppe, Head of Munich Re’s Geo Risks Research/Corporate Climate Centre: “It’s as if the weather machine had changed up a gear. Unless binding carbon reduction targets stay on the agenda, future generations will bear the consequences.”

    Munich Re recorded a total of 725 weather-related natural hazard events with significant losses from January to September 2010, the second-highest figure recorded for the first nine months of the year since 1980. Some 21,000 people lost their lives, 1,760 in Pakistan alone, up to one-fifth of which was flooded for several weeks. &lt;b&gt;Overall losses due to weather-related natural catastrophes from January to September came to more than US$ 65bn&lt;/b&gt; and insured losses to US$ 18bn. Despite producing 13 named storms, the hurricane season has been relatively benign to date, the hurricanes having pursued favourable courses.

Munich Re’s natural catastrophe database, the most comprehensive of its kind in the world, shows a marked increase in the number of weather-related events. For instance, globally there has been a more than threefold increase in loss-related floods since 1980 and more than double the number of windstorm natural catastrophes, with particularly heavy losses as a result of Atlantic hurricanes.

The rise in natural catastrophe losses is primarily due to socio-economic factors. In many countries, populations are rising, and more and more people moving into exposed areas. At the same time, greater prosperity is leading to higher property values. Nevertheless, it would seem that the only plausible explanation for the rise in weather-related catastrophes is climate change. The view that weather extremes are more frequent and intense due to global warming coincides with the current state of scientific knowledge as set out in the Fourth IPCC Assessment Report.

There are at present insufficient data on many weather risks and regions to permit statistically backed assertions regarding the link with climate change. However, there is evidence that, as a result of warming, events associated with severe windstorms, such as thunderstorms, hail and cloudbursts, have become more frequent in parts of the USA, southwest Germany and other regions. The number of very severe tropical cyclones is also increasing. One direct result of warming is an increase in heatwaves such as that experienced in Russia this summer. There are also indications of a higher incidence of atmospheric conditions causing air mass formation on the north side of the Alps and low-lying mountain ranges, a phenomenon which can result in floods. Heavy rain and flash floods are affecting not only people living close to rivers but also those who live well away from traditionally flood-prone areas. Although climate change can no longer be halted, even with the help of very ambitious schemes, it can still be curbed.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

People sometime blame the increasing economic loss due to disasters on socioeconomic factors, and you&#039;ll see from the above that this is largely true.  However, there&#039;s good evidence that &lt;i&gt;weather-related&lt;/i&gt; losses are on the rise due to changing climate.  Dr. Peter Hoeppe, head of the Geo Risks Research Department at Munich Re, &lt;a href=&quot;http://climateprogress.org/2010/12/23/the-year-of-living-dangerously-masters-weather-extremes-climate-change/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
For me the most convincing piece of evidence that global warming has been contributing already to more and more intense weather related natural catastrophes is the fact that while we find &lt;b&gt;a steep increase in the number of loss relevant weather events (about tripling in the last 30 years)&lt;/b&gt; we only find a slight increase in geophysical (earthquake, volcano, tsunami) events, which should not be affected by global warming. If the whole trend we find in weather related disaster should be caused by reporting bias, or socio-demographic or economic developments we would expect to find it similarly for the geophysical events.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the other hand, there will probably be some benefits to global warming.  For example, there may be a boom in the Arctic as circumpolar shipping routes open up and ice and permafrost retreat.  There&#039;s an interesting blog devoted to this topic:
