Trithemius was an intriguing character. In addition to being a lexicographer and occultist (to this day the Steganographia remains a standard occultist reference), he was also a Benedictine abbott and historian who became famous for both his eloquence and his unfortunate tendency to insert fictional passages into his historical work. Trithemius did his reputation no favors with his Steganographia—though I could argue he really boosted his modern brand. The book was immediately rejected, ordered burned by Frederick the Wise in the early 1500s and then formally banned by the Catholic Church in 1609, listed in the Index Librorum Prohibitorum along with such august company as John Milton, Francis Bacon, Copernicus and Galileo, to name just a few, where it remained for nearly 300 years.
