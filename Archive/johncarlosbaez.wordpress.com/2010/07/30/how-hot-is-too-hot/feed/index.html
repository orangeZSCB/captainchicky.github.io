It would have been straightforward to find a traditional publisher for such a book. However, we want our book to be as accessible as possible to everyone interested in learning about GP.

My comment was in the context of GA/GP in the context of &quot;plausibility evidence&quot; for the power of evolution. It basically comes down to your comment

&lt;blockquote&gt;

The set of possible genomes is dictated by the problem you try to solve

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The terminology is a bit slippery, and I meant custom genotype. The key distinction is that in GA typically the &quot;genotype representation&quot; (I think) is a data-structure and algorithm that, when filled with parameters (called an actual &quot;genome&quot;), is converted into an example of the thing over which you&#039;re trying to optimize. As a typical example, it has been used construct simple, robust digital circuits for given functions have been done using a genotype that specifies a list of (logic gate-types,interconnections). As an analogue with evolution of animals there&#039;s the criticism that the genotype representation was custom designed to be appropriate for the kind of problem.

&lt;a href=&quot;http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_programming&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Genetic programming&lt;/a&gt; is concerned with approximating given &quot;program black boxes&quot;, but it starts with some set of general program operators (eg, for LISP-style programs they&#039;re things like add, sub, etc, nodes in an expression tree, whilst for machine code GP it&#039;s actually instructions in a given machine&#039;s instruction set) and is then allowed to generate non-fixed-size programs in the course of &quot;evolution&quot; (unlike GA genotypes which are fixed size). Relevant to evolution of animals, the basic instructions are generally picked once when constructing the GP library without regard to what learning problems they&#039;ll be used for (much closer to the role the DNA-base coding of amino acids has in natural evolution), unlike the GA genotype which is picked with knowledge of the kind of problem about to be optimised.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;

...the simpler genetic algorithms are awkward to argue from because they have a custom designed genome.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
What is a &quot;custom designed genome&quot; in this context? 

My knowledge of genetic algorithms pretty much coincides with what Wikipedia has to say about them:

1. There is a feasability set, the possible genomes, consisting of elements of a (custom) data type, say, a byte array of length 300.

2. You start for example with some millions of individuals with randomly chosen genome from the feasability set,

etc.

The set of possible genomes is dictated by the problem you try to solve, the subset of genomes of individuals of the first generation is randomly chosen (maybe with a bias), the genomes of each following generation is determined by mutation, crossover, selection, but the set of possible genomes is immutable.]]></description>

Since nobody has publicly tackled the puzzle, I&#039;ll give away the answer, or at least part of it.

&lt;b&gt;Puzzle:&lt;/b&gt; The zeroth law of thermodynamics  says that two systems in thermal equilibrium must have the same temperature. So how could making something wet make it cooler? How could the wet-bulb temperature differ from the dry-bulb temperature?

Answer: a wet object is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; in thermal equilibrium with the drier air surrounding it.  That&#039;s why it tends to dry out.  If we keep constantly wetting it to keep it from drying out, it may be in a &#039;&lt;a&gt;stationary state&lt;/a&gt;&#039;, but that&#039;s different from thermal equilibrium.

That&#039;s what I understand.  What I don&#039;t understand is how people compute the wet-bulb temperature as a function of the dry-bulb temperature and the relative humidity, perhaps with the help of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychrometrics&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;psychrometric chart&lt;/a&gt;.  There&#039;s some physics here that I&#039;ve never studied.]]></description>

The demise of the megafauna is relevant to trying to save the world. It invalidates the &quot;nothing can go wrong&quot; optimists. It also makes us think carefully about what the saved world should be like. In particular: it shouldn&#039;t be covered with fire-friendly forests that destroy all life when they inevitably burn. Megafauna clear out underbrush and knock down trees, as they still do in Africa (where the megafauna co-evolved with humans).

Also slightly relevant is the fact that killer whales also combine high intelligence with thoughtless destruction of other life. Humpback whales migrate up the East coast of Australia. Killer whales used to cooperate with humans in hunting them: with aboriginals then later with whites. The head of the killer whales would wake the humans for the hunt. Everyone agreed that the killer whales were the instigators and organizers. Afterwards the killer whales took the tongues, leaving the rest for the human helpers.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;

As an engineer it is hard to believe that such a transformation could be done by random mutations of the genetic code, so alternative explanations of the mechanisms at work here are of interest, too, of course.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One thing that&#039;s worth bearing in mind is the extent to which, even now, a mouse and an elephant are already different &quot;parameters&quot; applied to a lot of the same biochemistry/gene interaction networks. (That&#039;s not a terribly precise statement, but the basic idea applies.) Thus the &quot;actual new content that has to be created by evolution&quot; is smaller than you might instinctively think.

From there, you can try to get some idea of what might be feasible by looking at what has been achieved by &quot;genetic programming&quot; (the simpler genetic algorithms are awkward to argue from because they have a custom designed genome). As such, there&#039;s very plausible evidence of the &lt;em&gt;combined&lt;/em&gt; power of huge populations, genetic crossover &#038; mutation and selection forces to move towards local optima. (I do some work attempting to create computer code for imprecise tasks using genetic programming, and the biggest problems are not the precise mechanisms but simply not being able to run as many generations on as big a population as I&#039;d like to.)]]></description>

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I don&#039;t find it so terribly hard to believe that plain old Darwinian evolution would suffice to explain evolutionary bursts of 400 darwins &#8212; that is, observable quantities changing by a factor of &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt; in 10&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;/400 = 2,500 years.  What &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/07/30/how-hot-is-too-hot/#comment-607&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Graham said&lt;/a&gt; is very important: in bursts, a lot of natural selection occurs not by mutation but by selecting among &lt;i&gt;pre-existing variations in the population&lt;/i&gt;.  

In layman&#039;s terms: you kill all the short people, and people get tall mighty quick.  

&lt;i&gt;However&lt;/i&gt;, you will be delighted to know that something like &lt;a HREF=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamarckism&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Lamarckian evolution&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; occur!  For example:

&#8226; P. Trojer and D. Reinberg, Histone lysine demethylases and their impact on epigenetics, &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt; &lt;b&gt;125&lt;/b&gt; (2006), 213-218.

It turns out that advanced life forms like us &#8212; by which I mean &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;eukaryotes&lt;/a&gt;, to be precise &#8212; are able to pass on traits not just using their DNA and RNA, but also using a trick called &lt;a HREF=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone_methylation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;histone methylation&lt;/a&gt;.  In eukaryotic cells, DNA is wound around proteins called  &lt;a HREF=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;histones&lt;/a&gt;. Adding one, two or three methyl groups to these proteins controls whether and how gene will be expressed in a given cell.  This is one way  cells in our body get to be very different even though they have the same DNA!  It&#039;s quite complicated and interesting &#8212; and in a surprising twist, a mother can apparently do histone methylation to genes in her child&#039;s embryo!  So, traits picked up during her life, encoded not in DNA or RNA but in histone methylation, can be passed on to her offspring.  

In short, besides genetics we must also study &lt;a HREF=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;epigenetics&lt;/a&gt; &#8212; the science of reversible but inheritable changes in gene expression that can occur without any changes in our DNA!

Evolution is like a game that life has been playing for billions of years.  The strategies in play are surely far deeper than we&#039;ve been able to fathom so far.  We&#039;re like kids watching grand masters play chess. We should continue to expect surprises....]]></description>

What <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/07/30/how-hot-is-too-hot/#comment-607" rel="nofollow">Graham said</a> is very important: in bursts, a lot of natural selection occurs not by mutation but by selecting among <i>pre-existing variations in the population</i>.  </p>
<p>In layman&#8217;s terms: you kill all the short people, and people get tall mighty quick.  </p>
<p><i>However</i>, you will be delighted to know that something like <a HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamarckism" rel="nofollow">Lamarckian evolution</a> <i>does</i> occur!  For example:</p>
<p>&bull; P. Trojer and D. Reinberg, Histone lysine demethylases and their impact on epigenetics, <em>Cell</em> <b>125</b> (2006), 213-218.</p>
<p>It turns out that advanced life forms like us &mdash; by which I mean <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote" rel="nofollow">eukaryotes</a>, to be precise &mdash; are able to pass on traits not just using their DNA and RNA, but also using a trick called <a HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone_methylation" rel="nofollow">histone methylation</a>.  In eukaryotic cells, DNA is wound around proteins called  <a HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone" rel="nofollow">histones</a>. Adding one, two or three methyl groups to these proteins controls whether and how gene will be expressed in a given cell.  This is one way  cells in our body get to be very different even though they have the same DNA!  It&#8217;s quite complicated and interesting &mdash; and in a surprising twist, a mother can apparently do histone methylation to genes in her child&#8217;s embryo!  So, traits picked up during her life, encoded not in DNA or RNA but in histone methylation, can be passed on to her offspring.  </p>
<p>In short, besides genetics we must also study <a HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics" rel="nofollow">epigenetics</a> &mdash; the science of reversible but inheritable changes in gene expression that can occur without any changes in our DNA!</p>
<p>Evolution is like a game that life has been playing for billions of years.  The strategies in play are surely far deeper than we&#8217;ve been able to fathom so far.  We&#8217;re like kids watching grand masters play chess. We should continue to expect surprises&#8230;.</p>

You need to distinguish between changing gene frequencies (which can happen quickly) and the emergence of new mutations (which is slow, especially in small populations).

Thanks for the link! I was implicitly talking about the emergence of new mutations, only later did it occur to me that others &lt;i&gt;might&lt;/i&gt; think I was talking about a change in the frequency instead, which is a result of the process of selection from an &lt;i&gt;existing&lt;/i&gt; gene pool.]]></description>
