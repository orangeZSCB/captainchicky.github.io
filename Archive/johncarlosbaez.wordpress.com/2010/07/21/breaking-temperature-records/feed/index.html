Florifulgurator,

Probably best if I leave it, at least until an opportunity arises to discuss it properly. (If John would like to. I don&#039;t mind if he chooses not to.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[John said &quot;I certainly haven’t focused on learning all the skeptical objections and how to refute them&quot;

Somebody has. The &quot;A few things Ill-considered&quot; blog at Science Blogs deals mainly with climate change. In particular the &quot;How to Talk to a Climate Skeptic&quot; link (top left) seems a useful resource. The 400 comments  on it give an idea of what you might get if you&#039;re not careful.

The genius at comment #65 has solved the problems of quantum gravity and climate change in one paragraph!]]></description>

niv, somehow I don’t think John will be interested in turning this into a Climate Audit outpost.

I&#039;m actually quite eager to learn about &#039;decentered principal components analysis, failed R2 verification tests, and whether unit roots in time series indicate the existence of purely stochastic trends that would pose the difficulty&#039;, as long as people can talk about them in a civil manner and in a suitable place &#8212; i.e., in a blog entry devoted to related topics.  I guess right now &#039;breaking temperature records&#039; is the most relevant entry, but later there will be better ones.]]></description>

At the risk of jumping in prematurely, I think one important question that I&#039;d think would be informative would be &quot;What is the minimum you would have to be convinced of in respect of AGW in order to take the position that AGW-model-based mitigation actions ought to be undertaken?&quot; (which is obviously not the same question as &quot;What would ... in order to believe AGW is a true theory&quot;). That might help define which areas of the big topic of climatology are important. (I can answer the question from my converse perspective in detail, but for me abandoning &quot;mitigation efforts&quot; basically comes down to being convinced that any influencable temperature changes will be small enough that large-scale agriculture capable of feeding the globe&#039;s population will remain viable.)]]></description>

I wonder if it’s psychologically possible for discussion of climate to take place without offence being provoked. I had rather hoped it might be possible here, but we’re not off to a good start.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yes, I&#039;ve been feeling a bit sorry about how it&#039;s going so far. I should start by telling everyone here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kent.ac.uk/secl/philosophy/staff/corfield.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;David Corfield&lt;/a&gt; is a friend of mine, a philosopher of mathematics, and &lt;i&gt;normally&lt;/i&gt; a very reasonable person.  We do, however, appear to differ in our assessment of how serious a problem human-caused climate change will be.  

David: do you want to try a thread where we talk about this, or do you think it&#039;s a bad idea?  I sort of dread it, because of the flames it may generate.  But maybe we should get it over with.  If you start by stating your position, it may go over better than your comments so far, which feel to me a bit like veiled jabs.  (Perhaps I&#039;m being hypersensitive?)  Or, you could just ask a bunch of questions: that would make it a bit harder for people to become offended.]]></description>

Steve,

That isn&#039;t at all why sceptics see those issues as a problem. We&#039;re looking at a *bigger* forest. But as you say, we don&#039;t want to drag it all up again here.]]></description>
