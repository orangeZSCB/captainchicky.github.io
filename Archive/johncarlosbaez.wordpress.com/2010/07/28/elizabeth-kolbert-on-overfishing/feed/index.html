					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/07/28/elizabeth-kolbert-on-overfishing/#comment-260&quot;&gt;Tom Leinster&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;

That’s an extreme case of what I mean by overemphasis on personal responsibility. 

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Well, I chose that example for a slightly different reason: not mainly because it&#039;s an &quot;overemphasis on personal responsibility&quot;, but because buying a recycled tote bag is the sort of pathetically puny step that can placate people into feeling good about themselves.  In fact grocery stores seem to sell these &lt;i&gt;in order&lt;/i&gt; to placate people.

&lt;blockquote&gt;

It’s not clear to me that persuading people to cut down on their flying is really the way forward. Yes, it would reduce carbon emissions, but by any appreciable amount?

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It&#039;s not &#039;the way forward&#039;.  In a minute, I&#039;ll list (again) what Joseph Romm thinks are the kind of steps we need to take.  

However, flying is the activity of mine that creates the most greenhouse gases &#8212; one long flight per year pretty much cancels out any other sort of conservation measures I take, like walking to work instead of driving&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.    So, cutting back on flying is the single best thing I can do to reduce carbon emissions &#8212; apart from, say, persuading 5 grad students to work on energy technologies intead of &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-category theory.   So, I&#039;ve been turning down a bunch of invitations to give talks. It&#039;s not hard: there are lots of math conferences where afterward I realize I would have learned more and had more fun by staying home and talking with James Dolan. 

But I know that my personal actions are only a microscopic part of &#039;the way forward&#039;.  We need action on a vastly larger scale &#8212; something more like the plan that &lt;a href=&quot;http://climateprogress.org/2009/03/26/full-global-warming-solution-350-450-ppm-technologies-efficiency-renewables/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Joe Romm&lt;/a&gt; lays out.  This is what he says we need to achieve by 2050 for the world to stabilize at 350-450 parts per million of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the atmosphere.  Each &quot;wedge&quot; below is a way of reducing carbon emissions by &lt;b&gt;1 billion metric tons per year&lt;/b&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
This is what the &lt;b&gt;entire planet&lt;/b&gt; must achieve:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 wedge of albedo change through white roofs and pavement (aka &#8220;soft geoengineering) &#8212; see &#8220;&lt;a title=&quot;Permanent Link to Geoengineering, adaptation and mitigation, Part 2:  White roofs are the trillion-dollar solution&quot; rel=&quot;bookmark&quot; href=&quot;http://climateprogress.org/2009/01/06/geo-engineering-adaptation-mitigation-green-stimulus-white-roofs-albedo/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Geoengineering, adaptation and mitigation, Part 2:  White roofs are the trillion-dollar solution&lt;/a&gt;&#8220;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 wedge of vehicle efficiency &#8212; all cars 60 mpg, with no increase in miles traveled per vehicle.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;1 of &lt;a href=&quot;http://climateprogress.org/2008/05/17/wind-power-a-core-climate-solution/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;wind&lt;/a&gt; for power &#8212; one million large (2 MW peak) wind turbines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 of &lt;a href=&quot;http://climateprogress.org/2008/05/17/wind-power-a-core-climate-solution/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;wind&lt;/a&gt; for vehicles &#8211;another 2000 GW wind.  Most cars must be &lt;a href=&quot;http://climateprogress.org/2008/01/21/plug-in-hybrids-and-electric-cars-a-core-climate-solution-nationally-and-globally/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;plug-in hybrids&lt;/a&gt; or pure electric vehicles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 of &lt;a href=&quot;http://climateprogress.org/2008/04/14/concentrated-solar-thermal-power-a-core-climate-solution/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;concentrated solar thermal (aka solar baseload)&lt;/a&gt;&#8211; ~5000 GW peak.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;3 of efficiency &#8212; one each for &lt;a href=&quot;http://climateprogress.org/2008/07/23/energy-efficiency-is-the-core-climate-solution-part-1-the-biggest-low-carbon-resource-by-far/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;buildings, industry&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://climateprogress.org/2008/04/24/recycled-energy-a-core-climate-solution/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;cogeneration/heat-recovery&lt;/a&gt; for a total of 15 to 20 million GW-hrs.  A key strategy for reducing direct fossil fuel use for heating buildings (while also reducing air conditioning energy) is &lt;a href=&quot;http://climateprogress.org/2008/08/07/the-other-geothermal-grew-33-in-2006/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;geothermal heat pumps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 of &lt;a href=&quot;http://climateprogress.org/2009/03/17/world-solar-photovoltaic-pv-market-installations-capacity-production-solarbuzz/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;solar photovoltaics&lt;/a&gt; &#8212; 2000 GW peak&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;1/2 wedge of nuclear power&#8211; 350 GW&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 of forestry &#8212; End all tropical deforestation.  Plant new trees over an area the size of the continental U.S.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 wedge of WWII-style conservation, post-2030 [just a placeholder, will blog more on this later]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are additional wedges that require some major advances in applied research to be practical and scalable, but are considered plausible by serious analysts, especially post-2030:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 of &lt;a href=&quot;http://climateprogress.org/2008/05/23/hot-rocks-are-a-rockin-hot-climate-solution/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;geothermal&lt;/a&gt; plus other ocean-based renewables (i.e. tidal, wave, and/or ocean thermal)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;1 of coal with &lt;a href=&quot;http://climateprogress.org/2009/02/23/if-obama-stops-dirty-coal-what-will-replace-it-part-2-an-introduction-to-biomass-cofiring/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;biomass cofiring&lt;/a&gt; plus carbon capture and storage &#8212; 400 GW of  coal plus 200 GW biomass with carbon capture and sequestration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/2 wedge of next generation nuclear power &#8212; 350 GW&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/2 wedge of cellulosic biofuels for long-distance transport and what little aviation remains in 2050 &#8212; using 8% of the world&#8217;s cropland [or less land if yields significantly increase or algae-to-biofuels proves commercial at large scale].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 of soils and/or biochar&#8211; Apply improved agricultural practices to all existing croplands and/or &#8220;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochar&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;charcoal created by pyrolysis of biomass&lt;/a&gt;.&#8221; Both are controversial today, but may prove scalable strategies.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That should do the trick.  And yes, the scale is staggering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note:  For those who prefer terawatts, 1000 GW=1 TW.  
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Of course, walking is good for other reasons: it gives me exercise, and it makes me happy in lots of ways, while driving makes me less happy.]]></description>

Re Griffith’s statement about heads up asses, I think that personal responsibility is often overemphasized. I can’t tell whether he’d agree or disagree with that. 

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I don&#039;t know.  Having watched his &lt;a href=&quot;http://fora.tv/2009/01/16/Saul_Griffith_Climate_Change_Recalculated&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;talk online&lt;/a&gt;, I think Griffith&#039;s &lt;i&gt;main&lt;/i&gt; point is that the amount our civilization needs to change to prevent dangerous global warming is vastly underestimated by most people who haven&#039;t thought about it hard &#8212; including most people who consider themselves &#039;environmentalists&#039;.  So I think it infuriates him that some people think buying a recycled tote bag is going to solve the problem.

&lt;blockquote&gt;

What I mean is that you hear a lot of “you should do this”, “you should do that”, etc. Take out your recycling, don’t take planes. Individuals can do a certain amount, but governments can do a lot more. 

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I agree.  Or I might say: individuals can do a lot more when they elect politicians who make governments do more.

&lt;blockquote&gt;

So I reacted to your list of “fish species not to eat” in the same way that I might react to a list of “grass species not to eat”.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I get it.  Unfortunately I&#039;m a pedant as well as an omnivore.  So I can&#039;t resist admitting that the main grass species I eat are corn, wheat, and rice.   

I thought a bunch about grasses when writing my &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;temperature&lt;/a&gt; webpage:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
By the &lt;a HREF=&quot;http://www.palaeos.com/Cenozoic/Oligocene/Oligocene.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Oligocene&lt;/a&gt;, 34-24 million years ago, glaciers started forming in Antarctica.  The growth of ice sheets led to a dropping of the sea level.  Tropical jungles gave ground to cooler woodlands.

What caused this?  Some seek the answers in plate tectonics.  The Oligocene is when India collided with Asia, throwing up the Himalayas and the vast Tibetan plateau.  Some argue this led to a significant change in global weather patterns.   But this is also the time when the supercontinent Gondwanaland finally broke up, with Australia and South America separating from Antarctica.  Some argue that the formation of an ocean completely surrounding Antarctica led to the cooling weather patterns. 

The beginning of the &lt;a HREF=&quot;http://www.palaeos.com/Cenozoic/Miocene/Miocene.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Miocene&lt;/a&gt;, 24 million years ago, is when grasses first became common.  It&#039;s sort of amazing that something we take so much for granted &#8212; grass &#8212; can be so new!   But grasslands, as opposed to thicker forests and jungles, are characteristic of cooler climates.   And as Nigel Calder has suggested, grasslands were crucial to the development of humans!  We grew up on the border between forests and grasslands.  That has a lot to do with why we stand on our hind legs and have hands rather than paws.  Later, the agricultural revolution relied heavily on grasses like &lt;a HREF=&quot;http://waynesword.palomar.edu/ecoph12.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;wheat, rice, corn, sorghum, rye, and millet&lt;/a&gt;.  As we ate more of these plants, we drastically transformed them by breeding.  In return, they drastically transformed us: the ability to stockpile surplus grains ended our hunter-gatherer lifestyle and gave rise to cities, kingdoms, more hierarchical societies, and slave labor.  

So, you could say we coevolved with grasses!

Indeed, the sequence of developments leading to humans came shortly after the first grasses.  Apes split off from monkeys 21 million years ago, in the Miocene.  The genus &lt;em&gt;Homo&#160;&lt;/em&gt; split off from other apes like gorillas and chimpanzees 5 million years ago, near the beginning of the &lt;a HREF=&quot;http://www.palaeos.com/Cenozoic/Pliocene/Pliocene.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pliocene&lt;/a&gt;. The fully bipedal  &lt;em&gt;Home erectus&lt;/em&gt; dates back to 1.9 million years ago, near the end of the Pliocene.  

&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

It&#8217;s sort of amazing that something we take so much for granted &mdash; grass &mdash; can be so new!   But grasslands, as opposed to thicker forests and jungles, are characteristic of cooler climates.   And as Nigel Calder has suggested, grasslands were crucial to the development of humans!  We grew up on the border between forests and grasslands.  That has a lot to do with why we stand on our hind legs and have hands rather than paws.  Later, the agricultural revolution relied heavily on grasses like <a HREF="http://waynesword.palomar.edu/ecoph12.htm" rel="nofollow">wheat, rice, corn, sorghum, rye, and millet</a>.  As we ate more of these plants, we drastically transformed them by breeding.  In return, they drastically transformed us: the ability to stockpile surplus grains ended our hunter-gatherer lifestyle and gave rise to cities, kingdoms, more hierarchical societies, and slave labor.  </p>
<p>So, you could say we coevolved with grasses!</p>
<p>Indeed, the sequence of developments leading to humans came shortly after the first grasses.  Apes split off from monkeys 21 million years ago, in the Miocene.  The genus <em>Homo&nbsp;</em> split off from other apes like gorillas and chimpanzees 5 million years ago, near the beginning of the <a HREF="http://www.palaeos.com/Cenozoic/Pliocene/Pliocene.htm" rel="nofollow">Pliocene</a>. The fully bipedal  <em>Home erectus</em> dates back to 1.9 million years ago, near the end of the Pliocene.  </p>

Re Griffith&#039;s statement about heads up asses, I think that personal responsibility is often overemphasized.  I can&#039;t tell whether he&#039;d agree or disagree with that.  

What I mean is that you hear a lot of &quot;you should do this&quot;, &quot;you should do that&quot;, etc.  Take out your recycling, don&#039;t take planes.  Individuals can do a certain amount, but governments can do a lot more.  So yes, I&#039;m conscientious to varying degrees about these things, but I&#039;m not under the illusion that it&#039;s going to make much difference.

So that&#039;s partly what my &quot;if&quot; was about.  Individual actions have very limited scope, and you might feel that they&#039;re not terribly important. 

On the other hand, many people do feel some sense of personal responsibility.  And I&#039;m a believer in &quot;do what you can&quot;, in some not very rigorous sense.  As you say, we&#039;re all compromised.  For years I ate fish and seafood but no other animals, and I was perfectly aware that this was an inconsistent position, but the inconsistency didn&#039;t bother me.  It&#039;s not a mathematical problem with a precise solution.

Guilting people out rarely works, I agree.  So let me explain a bit where that moment of impatience came from, which is maybe less to do with guilt and ethics than was apparent.  When you&#039;ve not eaten meat/fish for long enough, it ceases to seem like a foodstuff.  It&#039;s just not something you&#039;d put in your mouth --- like leaves or grass.  And it starts to seem bizarre that anyone else would eat it.  So I reacted to your list of &quot;fish species not to eat&quot; in the same way that I might react to a list of &quot;grass species not to eat&quot;.  Sure, don&#039;t eat _those_ ones, but...]]></description>

That would be surprising to me too, except that as I start talking more and more about ecological issues to my colleagues, I discover more and more how little some of them know, even about things in the news.  I think we should put a positive spin on this and say: there are many opportunities for academics to explain the science of ecology to their colleagues &#8212; and if we do this in a nice and non-preachy way, while making it clear how devastatingly important this information is, there&#039;s a chance they&#039;ll pass some of this knowledge on to their students, which can have a big multiplier effect.

For example, maybe one of those mathematicians will talk about overfishing the next time they teach basic ODEs.

In fact, I &lt;i&gt;definitely&lt;/i&gt; will do this, thanks to you!

I want to develop some courses on &#039;green mathematics&#039; when I get back to UCR, but as you suggest, a lot of this stuff could easily be worked into existing courses.  We might as well teach applications that &lt;i&gt;actually matter&lt;/i&gt;: many of our students are unlikely to actually spend much time solving ODEs, but some of the implications of these ODEs might stick with them.]]></description>

I agree with you, Tom.  But I might also add that we shouldn&#039;t eat any beef (since cattle are a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/aug97/livestock.hrs.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ridiculously inefficient way to produce food&lt;/a&gt; and may &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?newsID=20772&#038;CR1=warning&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;cause more global warming than cars&lt;/a&gt;), or drive cars or use airplanes except when absolutely necessary, or have children instead of adopting them, or... many other things.  

And while some of us are blameless on all accounts, most of us are so enmeshed in activities that are ruining the biosphere that it might, perhaps, be psychologically necessary for some of us to take things one step at a time.  

Or perhaps not.  In many ways it&#039;s &lt;i&gt;worse&lt;/i&gt; for us to carry around little lists of good fish and bad fish and feel like paragons of ecological virtue each time we go shopping, while still living in a way that&#039;s utterly out of balance in other ways.

The words of the engineer &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/diary/june_2010.html#june9_10&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Saul Griffith&lt;/a&gt; keep echoing in my mind: &quot;I know very few environmentalists whose heads aren&#039;t firmly up their ass. They are bold-facedly hypocritical, and I don&#039;t think the environmentalism movement as we&#039;ve known it is tenable or will survive.&quot;  

Since I don&#039;t feel able to serve as a good example in most respects, I don&#039;t plan to spend a lot of time here telling people how to behave.  All I hope to do is coax some scientists to turn their professional energies towards worthwhile goals.  

And I think the best way to do this is not by trying to induce guilt, as in: &quot;You should be using your intelligence to save the planet, not wasting it on cute puzzles.&quot;  I had an elementary school teacher who told us that we all owed a debt to society, and that annoyed me so much that it put me off doing anything &#039;useful&#039; for &lt;i&gt;decades!&lt;/i&gt;  Instead, I think the right way is to show scientists that it&#039;s &lt;i&gt;fun&lt;/i&gt; to tackle big real-world problems: it&#039;s &lt;i&gt;more intellectually interesting&lt;/i&gt; and just generally &lt;i&gt;cooler&lt;/i&gt; than anything else.

But yeah: if you care about fish in the ocean, don&#039;t eat them.]]></description>

I was surprised when, a couple years ago at a math conference, I talked to some mathematicians about overfishing who seemed never to have heard of the issue.  What&#039;s more, they were surprised to be told that very simple population models, of the type we often teach in basic ODEs classes, have a critical level of fishing/hunting/harvesting, below which the species survives indefinitely and above which it goes extinct.]]></description>

Hi John,

I&#039;m happy that you&#039;re pointing this out and supplying useful information...  

...but at the same time I have a kind of impatient reaction.  If you think that overfishing is a problem and want to do something about it personally, don&#039;t mess about with lists of which fish are better or worse to eat.  Just don&#039;t eat **any** fish.

(I don&#039;t mean you, John, in particular.  I mean anyone.)

Sorry to make my first comment here such a tetchy one.  No one likes a preachy vegetarian.  And please note the &quot;if you ... want do something about it personally&quot; part.  It&#039;s an &quot;if&quot;: not everyone does want to.]]></description>
