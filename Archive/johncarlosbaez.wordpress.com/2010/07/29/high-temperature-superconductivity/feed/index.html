The theory and the mechanism of a superconductor at a room temperature http://viktor19451.narod.ru/
The room superconductor represents multilayered structure, superconducting in a range of temperatures 77 - 620 K.
Superconductivity is confirmed by complex researches:
1. Two-partial tunneling.
2. Effect Josephson on an alternating current.
3. Effect Josephson on a direct current.
4. Effect of absorption of high-frequency radiation.
5. Display of diamagnetism.
6. Special structure of superconducting channels and
superconducting pair.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What&#039;s new here you ask, Tim? Well that depends on who you ask.  Progress in high-Tc has been slooooow. It took around thirty years before conventional superconductors were explained by BCS, though, so we can take some solace in that. There are many putative models describing the strange normal phase (pseudogap and strange metal): that&#039;s where all the action has been in the last decade. Fortunately, Leggett is a contrarian and has avoided much of this model building, preferring to ask what&#039;s not possible first, and then speculating. 

I don&#039;t know of any researcher who openly talks about room temperature superconductors or when they&#039;ll appear, so Leggett&#039;s questions (4a and 4b above) are spot on.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This brought back memories.

However, two-dimensional effects were being considered at that time--we worked with thin films.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[WA Little, Phys. Rev. 134 A1416-A1424 (1964)

Exciton-based ambient temp supercons: polyacetylenes substituted with polarizable chromophores, [-C(Ar)=(Ar)C-]n or [=C(Ar)-(Ar)C=]n.  Replace BCS large mass phonons (Debye temperature) with small mass excitons (energies around 2 eV or 23,000 K).  Critical temps above 300 K are likely, even with weak coupling.

Little proposed pendant dyes and had no synthetic entry to the polyacteylenes.  55 years later, synthesis should be facile:

[ArH -&#062; ArCHO --&#062; ArCH(OH)-(C=O)Ar --&#062; O=C(Ar)-(Ar)C=O] --&#062; H2C=C(Ar)-(Ar)C=CH2 --&#062; [=C(Ar)-(Ar)C=]n  + H2C=CH2

Append long alkyl, PEO, or PPO chains to the monomer for solubility and lyotropic liquid crystal formation.

Current Organic Synthesis 2(2) 231 2005
 &lt;b&gt;Methylenation review&lt;/b&gt;

 &lt;b&gt;Acyclic diene metathesis (ADMET) reviews&lt;/b&gt;

http://www.mazepath.com/uncleal/pave1.png
 Stereogram hydrogens and pi bonds omitted for clarity.  Supercons must not be chiral or electron conjugate momenta won&#039;t couple.

The 22-mer is apparently stabilized by -29.7 kcal/mole-arene.  Dope with holes (iodine; organic strong Lewis acid oxidizer) or electrons (alkali metal; organic strong Lewis base reductant) to set it off.

Somebody should look.  The worst it can do is succeed.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;

But did Mr. Leggett point it out in his lecture, like “first we’ll review the state of the art of 2005 in part a, then, in part b), I’ll report on a recently proposed hypothesis”?

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his review he was trying to emphasize &lt;i&gt;model-independent&lt;/i&gt; knowledge of cuprate superconductors.  I don&#039;t know if all the knowledge I listed goes back before 2005.

He made it sound like his hypothesis was new &#8212; and he said it could be falsified by experiments that are currently underway.]]></description>

I&#039;m not the one to ask :-)

But did Mr. Leggett point it out in his lecture, like &quot;first we&#039;ll review the state of the art of 2005 in part a, then, in part b), I&#039;ll report on a recently proposed hypothesis&quot;?

My &quot;I&#039;ve heard roughly the same ten years ago&quot; encompasses

- the existence of &quot;high&quot; temperature superconducting materials, high meaning above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen, as you said, because that means that nitrogen suffices for the cooling mechanism.

- no theoretical model to explain this phenomenon,

- the prophecy that there will be materials that are superconducting at room temperature soon, in x &#060; average lifespan of audience member years.

(As I said, my knowledge consists of the stuff I had to know to pass my Diplom exam).]]></description>

I&#039;m not the one to ask &#8212; this is the first talk on high-temperature superconductivity I&#039;ve ever been to!  

Do people always say that cuprates superconduct because Cooper pairing increases screening of interplane Coulomb interactions, with the energy savings taking place predominantly at long wavelengths and mid-infrared frequencies?  I got the impression that this was Leggett&#039;s new hypothesis.]]></description>
