You can use micro-organisms (hydrogenotrophic methanogens) to convert CO2 and H2 into methane and water at much lower temperatures. Here&#039;s a non-free paper on one such technology:

&#8226; Effects of pH conditions on the biological conversion of carbon dioxide to methane in a hollow-fiber membrane biofilm reactor (Hf–MBfR), Dong-Hun Ju et al, 2008

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;  
Carbon dioxide is one of the global warming gases. Utilization of a sustainable energy is one of the effective technologies for the mitigation of CO2 accumulation in the atmosphere. If renewable energy can be used for methane synthesis, H2 is converted to methane by reducing CO2. We investigated the conversion of CO2 to CH4 using a novel hollow-fiber membrane biofilm reactor. We have converted CO2 to CH4 with autotrophic methanogens using CO2 and H2. All the gases were diffused into water through the membrane without bubbles. We have successfully operated the Hf–MBfR for stable methane production from CO2 and H2 under continuous operations for 60–70 days at acidic and neutral pH. The methane ratio of the gas produced depended on the pH condition and reached about 60% at neutral pH and 80–90% at acidic pH. The produced methane contents were 751 mL day−1 on average from 20 to 58 days at neutral pH and 135 mL day−1 on average from 36 to 43 days, 247 mL day−1 on average from 44 to 70 days at acidic pH. At neutral pH, during the operating periods, acetic acid was continuously produced to 4000–7000 mg/L so that produced methane was considered to have been produced by hydrogenotrophic methanogens and acetoclastic methanogens. At acidic pH, during the initial operating periods, pH was maintained to 5.9–6.6 so that acetic acid was produced by acetogens. After adjusting to less than pH 5.5, however, it was decreased. At the same time, the methane contents produced were considered to have increased by acetoclastic methanogens.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

A correction:

Hope the arrow for the reverse shift shows up now:

CO2 + H2 <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2194.png" alt="↔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> CO + H2O.

Also, it is probably better to run it at higher temperature than the 300 &#176;C I mentioned.

You could use the Fischer-Tropsch process to turn CO2 in to carbon. This process was used on a large scale in WOII by the Germans, who had insufficient liquid hydrocarbon. They used caol as a carbon and energy source.

But to make a CO/H2 mix, I would not heat CO2 to 3000K. Rather just mix H2 and CO2, and use the reverse shift reaction:
 CO2 + H2  CO + H2O.
This reaction will work at atmospheric pressure and about 300&#039;C. (We will be mixing in H2 anyway!)The H2 comes from electrolyses of water.

The  Fischer-Tropsch process has a typical effciency of 60-70%. The loss is heat of about 300&#039;C. (could be partially used in a steam engine)

Sucking up CO2 from the atmosphere is difficult, but I personnally believe it can be done. (got some ideas for it myself)

As far as nuclear fusion is concerned, the mid-term future of the fusion projects depends very much on the success of the major experiment which is going to take place soon (possibly next year) at [https://lasers.llnl.gov](National Ignition Facility), namely trying to get controlled self-sustained (positive energy yield) fusion ignited by laser. The pre-experiments in that direction seem to give good [news](https://publicaffairs.llnl.gov/news/news_releases/2010/NR-10-01-06.html) so far. If the big experiment succeeds, then the hopes to have fusion sooner are bigger, hence there will be big governmental support for further plasma research. If it fails, the scale of plasma research funding is not going to significantly expand in next few years, and even some shrinking is possible I was told by a plasma physicist. The commercial reactors are expected in about 40 years from now, but the fate of a major experiment can always push that limit in one or another direction by 10-20 years.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/07/22/turning-renewable-energy-into-fuels/#comment-140&quot;&gt;Carbon capturing Algae Oil 101&lt;/a&gt;.

It looks to me like Carbon capturing algae... is a company ad, almost a spam. This blog is (if I understood it correctly) about finding out what are the best things to be done from the point of view of the Earth and Humanity. So it is irrelevant if some bloody senator Carr or some other symbol of political or industrial power (which made our Earth miserable in the first place). Second you obviously speak to people who are to invest into your business and give them costs (on your link) from THEIR point of view. How much they earn in SUBSIDISED system is not how much the Earth and Humanity earn; thus the subsidise should be subtracted and side effects should be measured qand described. So I suggest, if this is not a spam (I have a hope still) to show the concrete description and argumentation of the whole process: all resources needed to do the algae biofuels, where can it be done, how quick, how efficient, what rae the positive and negative sideeffects, needed infrastructure, which countries-societies have a potential to develop such a technology, sustainability...the technology, the hopes and problems, its background, feasability and real total costs from the point of view of Earth and Humanity...]]></description>

We should be able to develop a set of solutions for the developed world, and a different set of solutions for the undeveloped parts of the world.

Since the developed world is emitting most of the carbon, then most of the effort would have to be focused on it.]]></description>

I&#039;m fascinated by the idea of &lt;a&gt;biochar&lt;/a&gt;. 

Lovelock is big on biochar.  In &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/mar/24/biochar-earth-c02&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt; he writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I usually agree with George Monbiot and love the way he says it but this time – &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/mar/24/george-monbiot-climate-change-biochar&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;with his assertion that the latest miracle mass fuel cure, biochar, does not stand up&lt;/a&gt; – he has got it only half right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, it is silly to rename charcoal as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/biochar&quot; title=&quot;More from guardian.co.uk on Biochar&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;biochar&lt;/a&gt; and yes, it would be wrong to plant anything specifically to make charcoal. So I agree, George, it would be wrong to have plantations in the tropics just to make charcoal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I said in my recent book that perhaps the only tool we had to bring carbon dioxide back to pre-industrial levels was to let the biosphere pump it from the air for us. It currently removes 550bn tons a year, about 18 times more than we emit, but 99.9% of the carbon captured this way goes back to the air as CO2 when things are eaten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we have to do is turn a portion of all the waste of agriculture into charcoal and bury it. Consider grain like wheat or rice; most of the plant mass is in the stems, stalks and roots and we only eat the seeds. So instead of just ploughing in the stalks or turning them into cardboard, make it into charcoal and bury it or sink it in the ocean. We don&#039;t need plantations or crops planted for biochar, what we need is a charcoal maker on every farm so the farmer can turn his waste into carbon. Charcoal making might even work instead of landfill for waste paper and plastic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, in making charcoal this way, there is a by-product of biofuel that the farmer can sell. If we are to make this idea work it is vital that it pays for itself and requires no subsidy. Subsidies almost always breed scams and this is true of most forms of renewable &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/energy&quot; title=&quot;More from guardian.co.uk on Energy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;energy&lt;/a&gt; now proposed and used. No one would invest in plantations to make charcoal without a subsidy, but if we can show the farmers they can turn their waste to profit they will do it freely and help us and Gaia too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no chance that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/carbon-capture-and-storage&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;carbon capture and storage&lt;/a&gt; from industry or power stations will make a dent in CO2 accumulation, even if we had the will and money to do it. But we have to grow food, so why not help Gaia do the job of CO2 removal for us?&lt;/p&gt;
