					<description><![CDATA[Personally I work with many-Fermion systems, constructing many-body path integrals and performing Renormalization Group analysis. I enjoyed the run up of this thread talking about the &quot;fishyness&quot; of choosing an ensemble for a many-body problem. I too ran into this difficulty and have since had it &quot;hand-waved&quot; away from concern.

If you&#039;re dealing with a many-body system, your Hamiltonians are undoubtedly represented in the second quantization. Since they live in the full Fock space, a proper trace means summing over all symmetrized occupation states (i.e. from vacuum up to infinite particles).

The appropriate density operator for such a system would be $latex \hat{\rho}=e^{-\beta(\hat{H}-\mu\hat{N})}$. The appropriate thermodynamic potential in this case would be the &quot;Grand Canonical Potential&quot; $latex \Omega=E-TS-\mu N$ with the number of particles given by the expression $latex N=-\frac{\partial \Omega}{\partial \mu}$.

Thus you use the GC ensemble since you&#039;re working with second quantized Hamiltonians, but the above expression for the number of particles (where $latex N$ is fixed) acts as a boundary condition which can be inverted to give the chemical potential $latex \mu$ as a function of the temperature.]]></description>

A 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; particle calculation would probably take a few months on a modern PC so yes something faster that goes beyond the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross%E2%80%93Pitaevskii_equation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Gross-Pitaevskii mean field&lt;/a&gt; (i.e. zeroth order Bogoliubov local density approximation) could be quite useful. I&#039;d like to get a better understanding of how well the expression for the transition between classical and quantum length/energy scales behaves as the density (interaction strength) and noncondensate fraction increase.  

It would be neat if e.g. the intuitive concepts behind the two fluid model of quantum liquids could be put on a more firm footing with this approach.  I wonder how it would perform in the quantum turbulence regime http://physics.aps.org/viewpoint-for/10.1103/PhysRevLett.105.045301


ps Thanks for the latex pointer.  Is there a way for me to edit my previous post?  It doesn&#039;t quite make sense as it stands :)]]></description>

You can do LaTeX on this blog, as explained &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/07/10/welcome-to-azimuth/#comment-104&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  I changed your post to LaTeX.  

Can you do 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; bosons on a PC?  Kazimierz Rzążewski was talking about a PC &#8212; so it&#039;s possible he is seeking a method that was easy to implement.  

Or, it&#039;s possible that he wants an approximation that sheds light on how we can split our description of reality into a classical part and quantum part.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Evaluating thermal averages for 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; or more bosons is actually quite tractable with current path integral Monte Carlo methods.  The  basic approach goes like this: 

Suppose I want the expectation value for some observable (neglecting normalization) for a many body Hamiltonian H.  In the limit of $latex \beta \to 0$ (the high temperature classical limit) there are closed form expressions for the density matrix the simplest being $latex e^{-\beta H} ~ e^{-\beta T} e^{-\beta V} + $ error of order $latex \beta$ where I&#039;m assuming a Hamiltonian of the form $latex H=T+V$ (i.e. $latex T =$ kinetic energy $latex d^2/dx^2$ and $latex V$ is a local interaction potential).  

Since I only know how to treat $latex e^{\beta H} $ for small $latex \beta$ I need to use Feynman&#039;s trick to write $latex e^{\beta H} = (e^{-\beta H/M})^M.$   In other words I express the low temperature (quantum) density matrix as a product of M high temperature classical ones. inserting the identity operator between each of the high temperature density matrices we have with $latex A \equiv e^{-\beta H/M}$,

$latex \langle x&#124;A^M&#124;x \rangle = \langle x &#124; A &#124; x_1 \rangle \langle x_1&#124; A  &#124; x_2 \rangle \langle x_2&#124;  A &#124; x_3 \rangle \ldots \langle x_{M} &#124; A &#124; x \rangle $

the path $latex Y  = \{ x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_M\}$ can be sampled stochastically via Monte Carlo since given two paths 

$latex Y = {x,x_1,x_2,x_3....x_m}$ 

and 

$latex Y&#039; = {x,x_1&#039;,\ldots,x_m&#039;}$ 

the relative probability density is given by the 

$latex \prod_i^M A(x_i,x_{i+1})/A(x_i&#039;,x_{i+1}&#039;)$ 

i.e. just the ratio of the products of classical density matrices over the two paths.

Even though the path Y may seem like a very high dimensional object, sampling it stochastically via Monte Carlo methods turns out to be well within current computer power since for a given statistical error the computation time only grows as the sqrt of the dimensionality of the space. ]]></description>

My explanation wasn&#039;t terribly clear, in part because I&#039;m experimenting with live blogging, where I enter my notes from a lecture directly into a blog and do the bare minimum of post-processing.  The advantage of this system is that using it, I might have the energy to create blog entries on every talk that I go to.  The disadvantage is that the explanations won&#039;t be very clear.  So, people should ask questions!  And ideally, experts will materialize &#8212; popping into existence like vacuum fluctuations &#8212; and answer these questions better than I can.

I&#039;m looking at this paper:

&#8226; Emilia Witkowskaa, Mariusz Gajdaa and Kazimierz Rzążewski, Monte Carlo method, classical fields and Bose statistics, &lt;i&gt;Opt. Comm.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;283&lt;/b&gt; (2010), 671-675. 

and here&#039;s the impression I get.  Yes, in principle you can see what happens with any system in thermal equilibrium by using the Metropolis algorithm to randomly &#039;walk&#039; around the allowed states in a way that bumps into each one with a probability proportional to 

$latex e^{-E / k T} $

But for a cloud of hundreds or thousands of atoms this is computationally difficult.  So, we need more clever tricks.  

A bunch of bosonic atoms can be described by a bosonic quantum field.  In this paper the trick is to treat the low-frequency vibrational modes of this field classically, while treating the high-frequency modes quantum-mechanically.  This makes sense because:

1) The low-frequency modes are occupied by many atoms, while the high-frequency ones are occupied by few &#8212; that&#039;s what happens in Bose-Einstein condensation.

2) It takes a lot more information to exactly describe a vibrational mode quantum-mechanically than classically.  
Each mode is like a harmonic oscillator.  Classically we can describe what it&#039;s doing using just two numbers: its amplitude and phase &#8212; or if you prefer cartesian coordinates to polar coordinates, its position and momentum.  Quantum-mechanically it takes a lot more information: for example, an infinite list of complex numbers $latex \psi_n$ saying the amplitude for $latex n$ atoms to be in that mode.

3) We can hope that the low-frequency modes behave in an approximately classical manner, and save quantum mechanics for the high-frequency modes.

As Rzążewski mentioned in his talk, the prototype of this idea is our description of light using the classical Maxwell equations.  Classically, the state of each vibrational mode of light in a box is described by 2 numbers: its amplitude and phase.  Quantum mechanically, what we really have in each mode is a condensate of photons!  But if they&#039;re in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherent_state&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;coherent state&lt;/a&gt;, the classical description is a good approximation.   

Then, the paper describes how to use the Metropolis algorithm to figure out what&#039;s going on with the classical modes.

What about the quantum modes?  I&#039;m too tired now to extract this information from the paper &#8212; it&#039;s not jumping out at me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[After reading your summary and browsing the references I&#039;m somewhat confused.  Path integral quantum monte carlo methods sample the exact many body density matrix at finite temperature (typically within the canonical or grand canonical ensemble).  The work in the cited articles also operates in the canonical ensemble and seems to be invoking an unnecessary additional approximation wrt invocation of a classical field to simulate the &#039;non condensate&#039;.   Perhaps I&#039;m missing something.]]></description>

Okay, but maybe it helps if you devote the first paragraph of the next edition of TWF to this blog and it&#039;s goals.

On the other hand we don&#039;t know if it is dis- or encouraging (or the ratio of discouraged to encouraged people) if this blog is isolated aka not overrun :-)]]></description>
