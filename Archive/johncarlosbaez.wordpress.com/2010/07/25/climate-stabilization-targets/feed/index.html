					<description><![CDATA[The German weekly newspaper &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; has published an interview with the physicist &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Joachim_Schellnhuber&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Hans Joachim Schellnhuber&lt;/a&gt; who is the head of the &quot;scientific advisory board on global climate change of the German government&quot;.  Right now there is no online version available, and when it becomes available it will certainly be German only, here are some highlights:

1. Climate scientists should clearly point out the limitations of their knowledge and their models, lest they get dismissed as alarmist by the public, as has happened lately. Schellnhuber wishes that climate scientists could discuss their topics with the same freedom and passion that dominated the discussions of Bohr, Einstein et alt. about quantum mechanics, but says this is not possible because of the far reaching political implications and the scientific community, which is much bigger and more heterogeneous.

2. Climate change could have both negative and positive effects, but only the negative effects make it into the headlines, adding to the &quot;alarmist impression&quot;. Schellnhuber says that 90% of the funds go into the investigation &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt; humans are responsible for climate change, which is a question that he considers to be settled (they are). Therefore, there should be much more effort to investigate the &lt;i&gt;consequences&lt;/i&gt; of climate change.

3. His research committee advised that any temperature increase of more than 2 degrees Centigrade - compared to pre-industrial levels - should be avoided, for two reasons: First, politicians need clear-cut, quantitative answers, secondly, there is nothing known about a phase in earth&#039;s history with higher temperatures, so that an increase above 2 degrees would take us into uncharted territory (the latter part is taken from a different interview with Schellnhuber that I remember, I don&#039;t have any references for this claim, though).

4. It seems improbable that this 2 degree increase could be achieved without taking drastic measures like extracting $latex CO_2$ from the atmosphere directly.

5. Last but not least he thinks that industrialized democratic societies need to take the lead in these issues, and, on a personal note, he suggests to give 10% of the votes in today&#039;s parliaments to ombudsmen who have to represent the interests of future generations.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree that the scientists should police themselves and no-nothing amateurs like me should shut up. For example, if some maverick says &quot;the Arctic will be ice free in 5 years&quot; it is important for the experts to make a press release saying &quot;this is neither a consensus nor a majority opinion of climate scientists&quot;. Otherwise when the prediction turns up false then the whole case loses traction. Obviously I don&#039;t know what things to doubt, so I just get grumpy (and having shingles makes you grumpier).

It seems that humans can hopefully adjust by cultural means but the natural world will have trouble because so many are in smallish enclaves that are not interconnected. Also it is important to understand that  the range of a species is misleading. Typically there is only a subset of the range, perhaps quite small, where the species has a positive reproduction rate (more than 2 children per female survive), and in the rest the rate is less than 2, but continually replenished by the overflow from the positive area. So it is easy to accidentally lose that positive area. And clearly climate change will be shifting where that positive area is.

[It is interesting that for humans, cities have always been population sinks, replenished from the country. This was always explained as being because cities were unhealthy. But now cities are very healthy, but it is still true. The reason is that cities are unsuitable for female reproduction. Women prefer to have a nice settled status relation with other women they meet before having children and that is impossible in the city.]]]></description>

You seem rather quick to dismiss a lot of work by a lot of qualified scientists.  
Your argument neglects a couple of facts.  

First:  &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;changes will cause problems even though we are not miraculously living at some peak of perfection, if those changes occur faster than we can easily adapt.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;  Farmers have spent centuries adapting their methods of doing agriculture to the climate we have.  So, any change in any direction can make things that work well now stop working so well.  If the climate changes faster than farmers can adapt, life will become tough.  

Second: you shouldn&#039;t act as if the world is a unified place that will either get wetter or drier.  All the predictions suggest that &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; parts will get wetter and &lt;i&gt;other&lt;/i&gt; parts will get drier.  For example, the eastern USA will see more floods, while the southwest USA will see more droughts.  I believe this is happening already.  If we could easily ship floodwater from the east coast to California, everyone would be happy.  But we can&#039;t.

So, it&#039;s quite possible that changes will be negative on the whole, even if the world is not at &#039;peak of perfection&#039;.  

But there are some big questions: &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Will&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; changes be negative on the whole?  &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Will&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; changes occur faster than we can easily adapt to them?  

There&#039;s no way to settle these questions without doing a lot of work.  Luckily, people have put a lot of work into them.  If we&#039;re serious about these issues, we should read what these people have written, and discuss it.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A scary place to be. No way to go but down.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I also find it odd that you&#039;d make this sarcastic remark right after I took a lot of trouble to recommend the 2007 IPCC report, pointing out that it said this about the Americas:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Food production is projected to &lt;b&gt;benefit&lt;/b&gt; from a warmer climate...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

Understanding collapsitarians is useful if one is going to look into that literature.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I&#039;m pretty familiar with the psychological and political dynamics of people who consider civilizational collapse or &quot;going back to nature&quot; an important or even desirable possibility.  

Personally, I consider collapse scenarios important to ponder, and even fascinating in a certain grisly way, but not desirable.  

I would like the population of the world to decrease &lt;i&gt;gently&lt;/i&gt;, with a minimum of harm and suffering, ending in a state where everyone lives comfortably doing more or less what they want, with plenty of cities for people who like the intensity of urban bustle, plenty of villages for people who like those, plenty of farms for people who like to farm, plenty of beautiful parks for people to enjoy, and plenty of beautiful wild areas full of rich ecosystems.  Not &lt;i&gt;back&lt;/i&gt; to nature in the sense of reverting to primitive technology and scratching out a tough existence, but &lt;i&gt;forwards&lt;/i&gt; to nature in the sense of developing technologies that give us what makes us truly happy with a minimum of waste and damage.

This is what I&#039;d like, but it just possibly might not happen.  &lt;img src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/emoticons/rolleyes.gif&quot; /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

There are a significant number who think we should all go back to simpler lives [might be true] and view collapse as a good thing without thinking too much about it.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yes, and I&#039;m afraid Charles Greer, whose &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.energybulletin.net/node/16649&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;post on &quot;catabolic collapse&quot;&lt;/a&gt; I linked to, is a bit like that.  He&#039;s a pretty thoughtful guy.  His more detailed paper:

&#8226; Charles Greer, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.energybulletin.net/node/16649&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How Civilizations Fall: A Theory of Catabolic Collapse&lt;/a&gt;.

is definitely worth reading.  But his &lt;a href=&quot;http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;, while also fascinating, reveals a bit too much &lt;i&gt;enthusiasm&lt;/i&gt; for collapse, to my taste.  The fact that he&#039;s an &quot;Archdruid&quot; may explain it.

(His blog is definitely worth reading, even if you disagree with everything he says and the concept of a modern-day &quot;Archdruid&quot; makes you cringe &#8212;  because he can write well, and he&#039;s talking about important things.)

&lt;blockquote&gt;

The main category is folk who realise that cheap energy is the core of modern civilization, and believe it is running out. To believe that you have to ignore nuclear power...

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Indeed Greer seems to make this mistake: he claims that when oil runs out, civilization as we know it will slowly collapse &#8212; but he seems to think that when you count the production of the power plants and waste disposal, nuclear power consumes more energy than it produces.  I think the French would have noticed that by now, if it were true.

&lt;blockquote&gt;

Some expect climate change to negatively impact food production in a big way [makes no sense to me unless those unknown negative feedbacks overwhelm the positive feedbacks and make it cold and dry].

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It&#039;s not just doomster druids who believe that climate change will negatively impact food production in &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; areas of the world. If you&#039;re seriously interested in this issue, maybe it&#039;s worth spending a few days reading this stuff:

&#8226;  Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/contents.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Climate Change 2007: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability&lt;/a&gt;, 2007.

&#8226; International Food Policy Research Institute &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ifpri.org/publication/climate-change-impact-agriculture-and-costs-adaptation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Climate Change: Impact on Agriculture and Costs of Adaptation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.

The IPCC 2007 report has separate discussions on different areas of the world.  For North America, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/effects/agriculture.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;EPA&lt;/a&gt; provides a nice summary:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The IPCC concluded that, for North America as a whole (IPCC, 2007):

 Moderate climate change will likely increase yields of North American rain fed agriculture, but with smaller increases and more spatial variability than in earlier estimates. Most studies project likely climate-related yield increases of 5-20 percent over the first decades of the century, with the overall positive effects of climate persisting through much or all of the 21st century.

    * Food production is projected to benefit from a warmer climate, but there probably will be strong regional effects, with some areas in North America suffering significant loss of comparative advantage to other regions.
    * The U.S. Great Plains/Canadian Prairies are expected to be particularly vulnerable.
    * Crops that are currently near climate thresholds (e.g., wine grapes in California) are likely to suffer decreases in yields, quality, or both.
    * Climate change is expected to improve growing conditions for some crops that are limited by length of growing season and temperature. (e.g. fruit production in the Great Lakes region and eastern Canada).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For Asia, where I live, the IPCC report says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Results of recent studies suggest that substantial decreases in cereal production potential in Asia could be likely by the end of this century as a consequence of climate change. However, regional differences in the response of wheat, maize and rice yields to projected climate change could likely be significant (Parry et al., 1999; Rosenzweig et al., 2001). Results of crop yield projection using HadCM2 indicate that crop yields could likely increase up to 20% in East and South-East Asia while it could decrease up to 30% in Central and South Asia even if the direct positive physiological effects of CO2 are taken into account. As a consequence of the combined influence of fertilisation effect and the accompanying thermal stress and water scarcity (in some regions) under the projected climate change scenarios, rice production in Asia could decline by 3.8% by the end of the 21st century (Murdiyarso, 2000). In Bangladesh, production of rice and wheat might drop by 8% and 32%, respectively, by the year 2050 (Faisal and Parveen, 2004). For the warming projections under A1FI emission scenarios (see Table 10.5), decreases in crop yields by 2.5 to 10% in 2020s and 5 to 30% in 2050s have been projected in parts of Asia (Parry et al., 2004). Doubled CO2 climates could decrease rice yields, even in irrigated lowlands, in many prefectures in central and southern Japan by 0 to 40% (Nakagawa et al., 2003) through the occurrence of heat-induced floret sterility (Matsui and Omasa, 2002). The projected warming accompanied by a 30% increase in tropospheric ozone and 20% decline in humidity is expected to decrease the grain and fodder productions by 26% and 9%, respectively, in North Asia (Izrael, 2002).

Crop simulation modelling studies based on future climate change scenarios indicate that substantial loses are likely in rain-fed wheat in South and South-East Asia (Fischer et al., 2002). For example, a 0.5°C rise in winter temperature would reduce wheat yield by 0.45 tonnes per hectare in India (Lal et al., 1998; Kalra et al., 2003). More recent studies suggest a 2 to 5% decrease in yield potential of wheat and maize for a temperature rise of 0.5 to 1.5°C in India (Aggarwal, 2003). Studies also suggest that a 2°C increase in mean air temperature could decrease rain-fed rice yield by 5 to 12% in China (Lin et al., 2004). In South Asia, the drop in yields of non-irrigated wheat and rice will be significant for a temperature increase of beyond 2.5°C incurring a loss in farm-level net revenue of between 9% and 25% (Lal, 2007). The net cereal production in South Asian countries is projected to decline at least between 4 to 10% by the end of this century under the most conservative climate change scenario (Lal, 2007). The changes in cereal crop production potential indicate an increasing stress on resources induced by climate change in many developing countries of Asia. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So, it&#039;s a complicated mixed bag.]]></description>

<p>Personally, I consider collapse scenarios important to ponder, and even fascinating in a certain grisly way, but not desirable.  </p>
<p>I would like the population of the world to decrease <i>gently</i>, with a minimum of harm and suffering, ending in a state where everyone lives comfortably doing more or less what they want, with plenty of cities for people who like the intensity of urban bustle, plenty of villages for people who like those, plenty of farms for people who like to farm, plenty of beautiful parks for people to enjoy, and plenty of beautiful wild areas full of rich ecosystems.  Not <i>back</i> to nature in the sense of reverting to primitive technology and scratching out a tough existence, but <i>forwards</i> to nature in the sense of developing technologies that give us what makes us truly happy with a minimum of waste and damage.</p>
<p>This is what I&#8217;d like, but it just possibly might not happen.  <img src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/emoticons/rolleyes.gif" /></p>

<p>Yes, and I&#8217;m afraid Charles Greer, whose <a href="http://www.energybulletin.net/node/16649" rel="nofollow">post on &#8220;catabolic collapse&#8221;</a> I linked to, is a bit like that.  He&#8217;s a pretty thoughtful guy.  His more detailed paper:</p>
<p>&bull; Charles Greer, <a href="http://www.energybulletin.net/node/16649" rel="nofollow">How Civilizations Fall: A Theory of Catabolic Collapse</a>.</p>
<p>is definitely worth reading.  But his <a href="http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">blog</a>, while also fascinating, reveals a bit too much <i>enthusiasm</i> for collapse, to my taste.  The fact that he&#8217;s an &#8220;Archdruid&#8221; may explain it.</p>
<p>(His blog is definitely worth reading, even if you disagree with everything he says and the concept of a modern-day &#8220;Archdruid&#8221; makes you cringe &mdash;  because he can write well, and he&#8217;s talking about important things.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The main category is folk who realise that cheap energy is the core of modern civilization, and believe it is running out. To believe that you have to ignore nuclear power&#8230;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed Greer seems to make this mistake: he claims that when oil runs out, civilization as we know it will slowly collapse &mdash; but he seems to think that when you count the production of the power plants and waste disposal, nuclear power consumes more energy than it produces.  I think the French would have noticed that by now, if it were true.</p>
