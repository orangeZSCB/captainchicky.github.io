Personally I prefer threaded comments, since it allows people to develop a number of distinct lines of conversation in the comments to a given blog entry.  

Over at the n-Category Caf&#233; it&#039;s easy for &lt;i&gt;the reader&lt;/i&gt; to switch between whether they see a chronological view and a threaded view.    That&#039;s nice.  Since I&#039;m paying Wordpress to have a &#039;custom Cascading Style Sheet&#039;, maybe there&#039;s a way to accomplish this by adjusting the CSS.  Anyone know how?

Barring such trickery, it seems the only choice I get is a global choice to make comments threaded or make them chronological.  If that&#039;s my only choice, it&#039;ll be threaded.  Sorry.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Another question:  is it possible to enable comments to be sorted in reverse chronological order, rather than threaded?  It could be a convenient way to check out recent comments in a thread.  (I prefer this over subscribing to comment feeds, which becomes overwhelming.)]]></description>

Me wondering the same. I haven&#039;t even found decent HTML documentation for &lt;i&gt;users&lt;/i&gt; wanting to comment. After my latest HTML debacle I&#039;ll use my own blog for testing.

Perhaps John could open a &quot;Test your Post&quot; thread, too?]]></description>

That&#039;s been on my to-do list &#8212; thanks for reminding me.  

Does anyone out there know if I can enable previewing?  I paid my 15 bucks, so I can edit the CSS now, in case that helps.  Peter Woit has a kind of previewing for comments on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;his Wordpress blog&lt;/a&gt;, but that&#039;s on his own website &#8212; not sure that matters.]]></description>

Hey, folks - check out the new more readable quotes!

&lt;blockquote&gt;

Good and bad news. Good: I’ve just signed up for a free wordpress account, and pasting in lines like that (you might possibly even need to add a whole blockquote section like

blockquote {
color: #000000;
background-color: #ffffff;
font-weight: normal;
font-style: italic;
margin: 1em 3em; }

) does change the blockquote style.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Indeed it does, though I decided to go with &quot;normal&quot; rather than &quot;italic&quot; font-style.  

Now I can waste hours making this blog more beautiful.  Suggestions welcome... though I sure don&#039;t promise to do what you want!]]></description>

Cool.  Okay, let&#039;s call it The Azimuth Project.

Sometimes I think the reason I&#039;m so well-known is that I don&#039;t use pseudonyms like the rest of you guys.  ]]></description>
