					<description><![CDATA[Speaking of correctly modeling forcing, an interesting new paper &quot; Long-term Evolution of Sunspot Magnetic Fields&quot;
http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.0784v1
argues that long term and recent trends in observed infrared spectra and magnetic field strengths imply that a tipping point in sunspot activity is currently being reached, right now as it were. If that is correct, and if it is correct that sunspot activity is correlated with solar irradiance (e.g. the Maunder Minimum), then we may be at the start of another Capital Minimum.

One takeaway would be that efforts are misplaced that depend upon making sure that the recent solar cycle normal min-max change of &#062; 1 W/m2 is modeled to 5 more decimal points.]]></description>

Thanks for the reply and the link. When I said &#039;new&#039; I meant within the last few years.

While the current paper does develop ideas mentioned in the earlier work discussed by RealClimate, Pierrehumbert doesn&#039;t say much more than that he doesn&#039;t understand them, and perhaps as a result he doesn&#039;t really answer the point. Spencer claims that they&#039;re mixing up forcing and response, and Pierrehumbert responds by doing exactly that. The new paper concentrates on an aspect of the earlier work that the RealClimate article didn&#039;t mention.

The accuracy of paleoclimate sensitivity estimates is another topic entirely.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s not so new, actually.  With a little help from Julia Child, Ray Pierrehumbert &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/05/how-to-cook-a-graph-in-three-easy-lessons/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reviewed&lt;/a&gt; a prior version a couple of years ago.

					<description><![CDATA[This paper may be relevant from the opposite perspective.

http://www.drroyspencer.com/wp-content/uploads/Spencer-Braswell-JGR-2010.pdf

It discusses a new way of estimating climate feedback. It&#039;s only just been published so it&#039;s early days yet on whether it will stand up to the test of public scrutiny. I&#039;m sure there&#039;s much to criticise and develop about it.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
it would be much easier for example doing a weighted average of the things you want to do instead of having to pick one, but let’s not digress :-)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Well, the path-integral approach to quantum mechanics says that&#039;s what we actually do &#8212; but it doesn&#039;t &lt;i&gt;feel&lt;/i&gt; that way, so it doesn&#039;t help much.]]></description>
