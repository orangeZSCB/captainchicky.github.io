					<description><![CDATA[I discovered that it&#039;s possible to increase the number of nested comments-on-comments-on-comments to 10. Unfortunately the comments become absurdly skinny... and my attempts to use David Tweed&#039;s code to solve this problem have failed.  So, I&#039;ll stick with the same maximum amount of allowed nesting.

I couldn&#039;t figure out any way to allow people to preview comments without setting up this blog on my own host...

All I could manage is getting the header of this blog to show that scene from my back yard in Riverside again.  I found a webpage that &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.forums.wordpress.com/topic/custom-header-disappeared?replies=13#post-314463&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;explained why&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Anytime you make the first change to the CSS, the header image vanishes.&quot;  Yup, that&#039;s what happened to me.

&lt;img src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/emoticons/sm_upset.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;

At least they gave a cure that worked...]]></description>

Let’s start with the approach of the current nLab and nForum, with a minimum of restrictions. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That&#039;s my current plan.  Anyone will be able to edit the Azimuth Project wiki. People will need to register for the Azimuth Forum.  For that, I hope people give me a username or email address that I can recognize or look up.  On that forum, where we&#039;ll plan our next steps, I don&#039;t think I want mysterious entities of unknown intent.  

&lt;blockquote&gt;
n the case of Azimuth, you’ll have to re-evaluate the answers to your questions of this blog post on a regular basis (more like “every week” than “every other year” like over at the nForum). But there is no way to tell how this project will evolve, IMHO.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I agree.  

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There are a lot of topics and references in the book “Whole Earth Discipline” by Steward Brand. Once the Azimuth Project is online (and I have some spare time, which is rare these days, unfortunately), I’d like to add a page dedicated to the book, with a list of the topics discussed in the book. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yay!  I&#039;m planning to do that too.  I&#039;m also planning to write one or more issues of &lt;i&gt;This Week&#039;s Finds&lt;/i&gt; about this book.

So, you don&#039;t need to do all the work here.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Next step would be to discuss some controversial topics on the Azimuth forum, like: “Steward Brand says this or that (link to the page), Mr. X says otherwise, does anyone have any information about this?”.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Right.  If I get really lucky, maybe I&#039;ll can do an interview with Brand, where I ask questions that we come up with.  Maybe that&#039;s overoptimistic, but &lt;i&gt;eventually&lt;/i&gt; I want Azimuth to become a big enough deal that we can do that sort of thing.

Anyway: the doors will open on September 27th.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Gowers wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
One of the reasons I’ve done nothing about climate change is a feeling that even if the science were 100% clear to all serious-minded people in the world, there are enough non-serious-minded people and vested interests, and enough prisoner’s-dilemma type problems, that actually getting something done about the problem is hopeless.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I agree, it&#039;s hopeless.  That&#039;s an important realization.  I was very gloomy for a year or two after that sank in.

But then I came to my senses.  You have to say: okay, so the problem is &quot;hopeless&quot;.  What does that actually mean?  Is the world coming to an end?  Will everyone die?  Will all species go extinct?  I think the answer is obviously &lt;i&gt;no&lt;/i&gt;.

If the world were certainly coming to an end, we&#039;d be off the hook.  We could say: &quot;Nothing I do will have any really have any effect, so I might as well just relax and enjoy myself&quot;.  

But we are not off the hook.  &lt;b&gt;Even if a disaster of some sort is certain, there are different degrees of disaster, and it&#039;s our responsibility to minimize the disaster.&lt;/b&gt;  

I&#039;m pretty sure that politicians and the mass of citizens will take significant action on global warming only when things get quite bad.  By then, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/climate/2008/0812/full/climate.2008.122.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;even drastically slashing carbon emissions won&#039;t improve the climate for hundreds of years&lt;/a&gt;.  Emission reductions will be necessary to keep things from getting worse, but not sufficient to make things better.  So, presumably we&#039;ll do a mixture of:

1) adaptation,

2) geo-engineering, and

3) suffering.

(Under the heading of &#039;geo-engineering&#039; I include actively removing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the atmosphere as well as various potentially riskier strategies to cool down the Earth &#8212; including strategies that could backfire and make things a lot worse.)

So, I think there&#039;s quite a spectrum of possible futures to consider here, ranging from slightly bad to quite bad to very bad to very &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;very&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; bad.  And I think we should all work hard to avoid the worst end of that spectrum.  

And we have to do it now, because people don&#039;t always get better at optimizing their collective behavior when they&#039;re struggling to survive.  Often they do things like start wars.

(Civilizations have collapsed due to climate change before.  I&#039;ve been reading about that a lot, and I&#039;ll talk about it someday.)

&lt;blockquote&gt;
My question therefore is what you mean when you say that you want to help save the planet.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I mean I want to do my best to achieve a future near the better end of the spectrum of possibilities.  

But of course the question is then: &lt;i&gt;how?&lt;/i&gt;

And the answer to this presumably depends a lot on the person asking it.  We&#039;re all good at different things, and if we take advantage of our particular skills, I think we can accomplish a lot more than if we do what&#039;s &#039;best&#039; in some general way but not particularly best for us.

So, while global warming is mainly a political issue, and we really need some brilliant politicians to tackle it, I have to figure out something else to do that &lt;i&gt;I&#039;ll&lt;/i&gt; be good at &#8212; since I&#039;m not good at politics.  And I&#039;m still trying to figure this out.  But I have some ideas.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Is it something like this: you want to create a resource that is so well-informed (it would get a reputation for being scientifically very sound) and so balanced (it would also get a reputation for being very clear about what is known and what is not known, and what the general certainty levels are) that it would become a recognised authority, and one that cranks would have a very hard time criticizing. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Actually that&#039;s not quite my goal &#8212; though it&#039;s close enough that I might try to do this &lt;i&gt;too&lt;/i&gt;.

You see, I do think it&#039;s important to make reliable and well-presented information about environmental issues more easily available.   But I don&#039;t think making it &#039;hard for cranks to criticize&#039; should be a major goal.   That strategy is too defensive.  And cranks will criticize anything.

Of course you can try to provide information that&#039;s so clear that &lt;i&gt;ordinary citizens&lt;/i&gt; will see it makes much more sense than what the cranks are saying.  And this is a good idea --- though at least in the US, it would be quite hard to change a lot of minds that are already made up.

But I&#039;m starting to lean towards something more like this: try to provide information that&#039;s so clear that &lt;i&gt;scientists and engineers&lt;/i&gt; will see it makes much more sense than what the cranks are saying.

And, simultaneously, provide these scientists and engineers with ideas about &lt;i&gt;what they can do now&lt;/i&gt;. There are lots of projects to work on.  Lots of scientists are already doing them --- but where can you look to see all these projects, in a nicely organized way?  Where can you see people with many different approaches discussing their relative merits?  I think there might be a hole here.

Ideas are welcome!  That&#039;s one thing the Azimuth Forum will be about: what to do.]]></description>

Yes, but available tactics dictate strategy too. The relevant term for battle preparation is marshalling of forces. If we look to the Marshal of Marshals, the enduring image of Napoleon to me (besides winning battles without fighting) is him napping on the ground after prepositioning his men.

Proper preparation can indeed yield confidence and comfort. However because there is no climate Napoleon we will have nagging doubts that will kill the buzz.]]></description>

Of course, we can also just wing it: try something, and see if it works.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I don&#039;t see any other way. Let&#039;s start with the approach of the current nLab and nForum, with a minimum of restrictions. In the case of Azimuth, you&#039;ll have to re-evaluate the answers to your questions of this blog post on a regular basis (more like &quot;every week&quot; than &quot;every other year&quot; like over at the nForum). But there is no way to tell how this project will evolve, IMHO.

There are a lot of topics and references in the book &quot;Whole Earth Discipline&quot; by Steward Brand. Once the Azimuth Project is online (and I have some spare time, which is rare these days, unfortunately), I&#039;d like to add a page dedicated to the book, with a list of the topics discussed in the book. One could then go on and create a page for each topic and add the references cited in the book.

Next step would be to discuss some controversial topics on the Azimuth forum, like: &quot;Steward Brand says this or that (link to the page), Mr. X says otherwise, does anyone have any information about this?&quot;.

That&#039;s the way the nLab and nForum work. 

Then let&#039;s wait and see what happens :-)]]></description>

I guess my anxious thoughts center on the individuals who will bear the brunt of climate change. Good point about the pre-battle stage--most worries evaporate once action is being taken. However, this is an indication of how important the pre-battle is, since strategy dictates tactics! 

We don&#039;t know that the world isn&#039;t ending, but at least it probably has enough momentum to keep going for a few weeks longer...]]></description>

I&#039;m a pretty happy guy.  I don&#039;t have &quot;anxiety&quot; about the climate &#8212; I feel &lt;i&gt;sure&lt;/i&gt; the climate is going to hell!  But I also know the world isn&#039;t ending.  Now that I&#039;m finally throwing myself into action, and some compadres are joining in to help out, I&#039;m actually enjoying it.  Perhaps the most nerve-racking part of a battle is sitting around waiting for it to start.]]></description>

He pulls up a graph of “projected emissions based on scenario A”. Some heckler from the audience asks him where he got it from, and he says he pulled it from the Azimuth Project. The heckler derides him, saying “Yeah well you never know who puts stuff up there, everyone knows there aren’t even any usernames or displayed IP addresses like Wikipedia.” I think it will build trust if people’s actual names appear. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I agree.  But I think it&#039;s also crucial that all claims on the Azimuth Project be &lt;i&gt;checkable&lt;/i&gt;.  We have to give sources for all claims, and make calculations as transparent as possible.  To a large extent this will reduce the need for individual contributors to have well-established reputations.

So when he gets heckled, our speaker can either say &quot;That graph was based on Schmitt&#039;s paper in &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;&quot; or &quot;That graph is explained in detail on Azimuth&quot;.

(And eventually, in my dreams, the second option will be even better than the first, because you have to pay to read &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;, and they don&#039;t demand that their authors include all their supporting data, and it&#039;s not easy for people to point out or fix mistakes!)]]></description>
