					<description><![CDATA[Relative to the Monty Hall Problem.
One way to see that A should at least reselect (in some way) is to consider a Player B.
Suppose B comes on stage after player A has selected, Monty has opened 1 door AND A&#039;s door is reclosed. 
Now what is the probability of success for B? Oviously it is 1/2. B can pick randomly from the 2 remaining doors. But wait how can B get 1/2 from the current situation while A is at 1/3.
Why wouldn&#039;t A just try again randomly on the 2 remaining doors.
But as we know A can do better than 1/2.
Since A knows that the prob(D1) + prob(D2) equals 1. And since A already knows his door has probability 1/3 (its prob couldn&#039;t have changed because of Monty&#039;s actions) the other door must have prob = 2/3!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What I do not understand is why in this analysis, order is taken into account. Why should we care about first child/second child?

We know that one of the child is a boy. If we know the lady has 1 boy, we can rule out the GG case. So we are left with two possibilities: the other child is either a boy or a girl. The cases are not BG, GB or BB but rather B or G. the probability that the lady has 2 boyes is 1/2.

Not saying that the analysis is wrong, just that I dont understand it (I seem to always go wrong somewhere when trying to solve probability problems.) I just can not see where in this case, so if someone could point it out for me?]]></description>

The question of a complete specification can be quantified as follows: suppose there are B species of boy and G species of girl (&quot;species&quot; includes day of week born, in which case B=G=7).  First suppose you know there&#039;s a boy but you don&#039;t know species it is, then there are B*B ways of having two boys, and 2BG ways of having a boy and a girl, so 
p(2 boys &#124; at least one boy) = B*B / (2BG + G*G).
This is equal to 1/3 when B=G.

Now suppose instead you learn the species of the boy: now there are 2(B-1) ways of having two boys of different species, plus 1 one way of having two of the same species (a total of 2B-1), and there are 2G ways of having a boy of fixed species and a girl. So
   p(2 boys &#124; at least one boy of known species) =  (2B-1) / (2B-1 + 2G).
when N=B=G, this reduces to 
  p(2 boys &#124; at least one boy of known species) = (1/2)(1 - 1/(4N-1)),
and hence monotonically increases from 1/3 for N=1, to an asymptote of 1/2 as N goes to \infty. (For the intermediate case N=7, it gives 13/27.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/09/05/probability-puzzles-part-2/#comment-1078&quot;&gt;gowers&lt;/a&gt;.

Refining the probability based on additional info fits naturally in the Bayesian framework. Suppose someone flips two fair coins (to isolate from the social brain wiring used to consider children), and reports that at least one is a head. Then the probability of two heads is
(0)  q = p(2H &#124; at least 1H) = 1/3.

Now the person shows you one of the two coins, and it is a head. Using Bayes&#039; thm, this can be used to refine the estimate of the probability of two heads:
(1a)    p(2H &#124; see H) = p (see H &#124; 2H) q / p(see H).
                      = q / p(see H)
The denominator can be expanded as usual
(1b)    p(see H) = p(see H &#124; only 1H) p(only 1H) + p(see H &#124; 2H) p(2H)
                 = p(see H &#124; only 1H) (2/3) + 1 (1/3)
The value of p(see H &#124; only 1H) depends on the protocol employed by the person who showed you the H.

A. If the protocol is the person looks at the two coins and always shows one with an H (if there is one, which is always the case here), then p(see H &#124; only 1H) = 1, and 
(1b&#039;)  p(see H) = 2/3 + 1/3 = 1, 
and you&#039;ve learned nothing (you already knew there was at least 1 H):
(1a&#039;)  p(2H &#124; see H) = q / p(see H) = q = 1/3

B. But if the coin shown is instead sampled, say the person shows coin 1 with probability x and coin 2 with probability 1-x for x in [0,1] (this includes as special cases all of random sampling, x=1/2, or always showing first or second coin, x=0,1), then p(see H &#124; only 1H) = 1/2 , and
(1b&#039;&#039;) p(see H) = (1/2) (2/3) + 1/3 = 2/3
so that 
(1a&#039;&#039;) p(2H &#124; see H) = q / p(see H) = q / 2/3 = 1/2 

This framework makes explicit how the probability estimate is refined based on what one learns from random sampling, beyond already knowing that there was at least one H.

For a hybrid sampler, say using protocol A with probability y and protocol B with probability 1-y, then p(2H &#124; see H) will interpolate between 1/3 and 1/2 as y decreases from 1 to 0.]]></description>

There&#039;s the converse way of looking at it. For the &quot;seeing a boy case&quot;, it&#039;s a probability conditional on zeroth-order statement (albeit one you could view as having particular variable of which child you see is chosen by a random process). On the other hand, saying/knowing someone has boy is implicitly involving an existential quantifier (&quot;there exists one child who&#039;s a boy&quot;) so it&#039;s conditional on a first order statement. It doesn&#039;t seem unnatural to me that a first order statement should yield different results to a zeroth order one.

It seems like the unease comes from the way natural language doesn&#039;t make it that obvious there&#039;s a first order quantifier in one case and not the other (along with possibly the order in which we&#039;ve considered the problems).

The bit I don&#039;t have an intuitive grasp on is how adding more &quot;problem orthogonal&quot; constraints to an existentially quantified statement makes it &quot;tend to&quot; a zeroth order statement with only the problem relevant constraints.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The above &quot;philosopher-posed&quot; problem here can also be found in this popular book, &lt;i&gt;Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and its consequences&lt;/i&gt;, by J.A.Paulos (1989, 2001) p. 86: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Consider a randomly selected family of four that is known to have at least one daughter. One possible way you may come to learn this: You&#039;re in a town where every family includes a mother, father, and two children, and picking a house at random you are greeted by a girl. You&#039;re told that in this town a daughter, if there is one, always answers the door.
In any case, given that a family has at least one daughter, what is the conditional probability that it also has a son? The perhaps surprising answer is 2/3, since there are three equally likely possibilities &#8212; older boy, younger girl; older girl, younger boy; older girl, younger girl &#8212; and in two of them the family has a son. The fourth possibility &#8212; older boy, younger boy &#8212; is ruled out by the fact that a girl answered the door.

By contrast if you were simply to run into a girl on the street, the probability that her sibling is a boy would be 1/2.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first part is well-specified. The second assumes no further conditions (e.g., as &quot;Tom&quot; said in response #1 answer could be &quot;it depends&quot;, and would change to probability 1 if in this town families were overcautious specifically if they had two girls and never let one venture out on the street alone...).

The book covers many examples of elementary mathematical misconceptions for the general public.]]></description>

Consider a randomly selected family of four that is known to have at least one daughter. One possible way you may come to learn this: You&#8217;re in a town where every family includes a mother, father, and two children, and picking a house at random you are greeted by a girl. You&#8217;re told that in this town a daughter, if there is one, always answers the door.<br />
In any case, given that a family has at least one daughter, what is the conditional probability that it also has a son? The perhaps surprising answer is 2/3, since there are three equally likely possibilities &mdash; older boy, younger girl; older girl, younger boy; older girl, younger girl &mdash; and in two of them the family has a son. The fourth possibility &mdash; older boy, younger boy &mdash; is ruled out by the fact that a girl answered the door.</p>
<p>By contrast if you were simply to run into a girl on the street, the probability that her sibling is a boy would be 1/2.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The first part is well-specified. The second assumes no further conditions (e.g., as &#8220;Tom&#8221; said in response #1 answer could be &#8220;it depends&#8221;, and would change to probability 1 if in this town families were overcautious specifically if they had two girls and never let one venture out on the street alone&#8230;).</p>
<p>The book covers many examples of elementary mathematical misconceptions for the general public.</p>
