Yes, that was my first reaction too.  (^_^)

&#062;Could it be “gamed”?

As I&#039;ve written it, definitely.  If trapped carbon is credit, then finding for new carbon deposits causes inflation, but whoever owns the relevant land gets the new credit, so there&#039;s every incentive to keep exploring.  Aside from the direct enivoronmental damage that digging can cause, this basically means that countries with carbon deposits hold the rest of the world hostage, saying ‘We&#039;ll burn this if you don&#039;t pay us.’.

Another problem is that it focusses on one element to the exclusion of all others.  Cap-and-trade régimes can be adjusted as times change, but monetary systems get entrenched.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Subak article was very interesting, and the fact that it works.

Hi Allan,

Thanks for taking my comment in the positive light (as it was intended) :)

World markets are a fascinating thing. We&#039;ve been through several years of crisis and things are still teetering on edge. Many are losing faith in &quot;fiat currencies&quot;. China last year was pushing for the use of SDRs as a global currency, but I&#039;m skeptical of such a thing. More realistically, the Asia region could form their own currency similar to the EURO. But how would it be valued? I suspect something along the lines of a commodity basket. Especially if this Asian bloc includes the middle east. Most participants would be happy to have an alternative to the USD.

Currently, the US dollar has the benefit of being a &quot;safe haven&quot;. When perceptions of risk increase, people tend to flee to USD. It is actually more like the least ugly of a bunch of ugly alternatives in a race to the bottom. If there were an alternative currency, the USD would be seriously hurt.

This &quot;race to the bottom&quot; is one of the serious risks that keep me up at night (since it is my job to think about these things).

My first reaction to Toby&#039;s suggestion was &quot;Cute! But it will never work.&quot; Following the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Mathforge/Azimuth/comments.php?DiscussionID=51&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Azimuth Golden Rule&lt;/a&gt;, we should try to incrementally improve on it, until it might start resembling something that could work.

So let&#039;s say I am a &quot;CO2 miner&quot; and we&#039;re hoping to start a &quot;CO2 rush&quot; (like the &quot;gold rush&quot;). How do I get paid? We&#039;d need some way to weigh my CO2. How do I store it? What is done with it when it is extracted? Could it be &quot;gamed&quot;? Could I cheat somehow? Are there easy ways to obtain CO2 that would actually be harmful to the environment?

Just thinking out loud...]]></description>

Maybe a &quot;Green Rating Agency&quot;. Companies such as Moodys, S&#038;P, Fitch make boat loads of money rating the credit quality of corporations.

Why not an agency that rates corporations for their &quot;Greenness&quot;?]]></description>

Hi Eric -- of course that is precisely what I meant by &quot;before it became big news&quot;!  The roots of the crisis ran far further back I agree.  Glad to see you called it too.

And thanks for the links!  I&#039;m very fascinated by the idea of currency-based solutions to saving the planet -- can currencies like this hypothetical &quot;GreenBack&quot; really be backed by contracts on &quot;sustainability&quot; (perhaps amongst other commodities)?

Nothing would gall people (corporations, countries, ..) into action like being able to see the dollar value of their wealth depreciating in lockstep with the sustainability of our environment.]]></description>
