You&#039;re asking great questions, Tim.  And I see only one climate science expert in the discussion of &quot;week304&quot;: Nathan.  Maybe there are more lurking around... but I haven&#039;t seen them posting yet.]]></description>

This is an opportunity to learn how me talking about climate science looks like to experts, I think that&#039;s comparably funny :-)]]></description>

The main reason is to solve the Lindblad equation as a matrix eigenvalue equation using a computer program.  

Yeah, there is some funny stuff there, but I still think worth the read.]]></description>

It seems strange to speak of &#039;linearizing&#039; the Lindblad equation, because it&#039;s already obviously a linear differential equation (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindblad_equation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).

It also seems odd, from a mathematician&#039;s viewpoint, to define an operation &#039;vec&#039; which takes a matrix and thinks of it as a vector, since the space of matrices is quite obviously a vector space.

It similarly seems odd to prove that the map

$latex B \mapsto A B C $

is linear, where $latex A, B, C$ are matrices, because again this is quite well-known.

But I&#039;m sure there&#039;s also lots of good stuff in this paper.]]></description>

Ladies and gents: on a related note, there is a great &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.qinfo.org/people/nielsen/blog/archive/notes/0401.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;short review article by Nielsen&lt;/a&gt; which shows techniques that can be used to linearise the Lindblad equation: check out Roth&#039;s lemma.  

I think category theorists will like to see Roth&#039;s lemma, as it&#039;s the linear algebra behind sliding boxes around wires, operator vector duality (called map-state duality in quantum computing) and all that other great stuff.  They define operations such as vec(&#124;j&#062;&#124;k&#062;) = &#124;k&#062;&#124;j&#062;, etc. 

A friend of mine James Whitfield visited and learned some string diagram theory by presenting the diagrammatics behind this review paper.]]></description>

I wish you didn&#039;t ask this question. This is the type of question that gets stuck in your head (like a song you can&#039;t kick) and you can&#039;t rest until you solve it :)

My gut tells me it&#039;s coming from some form of inner product.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[By the way, I think the way the Lindblad equation is &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindblad_equation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;usually written&lt;/a&gt; is quite annoying.  The first term is fine, but the second term, that big fat sum, is disgusting.  I&#039;m sure that with the correct algebraic concepts one could write down this second term in a more conceptual way.  But I&#039;m not sure what these concepts are!  

The elements called $latex L_n$ are a basis of the traceless matrices on our Hilbert space $latex \mathbb{C}^N$ &#8212; that is, a basis of $latex \mathfrak{sl}(N,\mathbb{C})$.  So, presumably the relevant algebra involves $latex \mathfrak{sl}(N,\mathbb{C})$.  However, what&#039;s going on with the expression

$latex \rho L_m^\dagger L_n - L_m L_n^\dagger \rho + 2 L_n \rho L_m ? $

where $\rho$ is a positive matrix of trace 1?  Are we dealing with some sort of representation of $latex \mathfrak{sl}(N,\mathbb{C})$ on the vector space of self-adjoint operators, or something?

Or maybe a representation of $latex \mathfrak{sl}(N^2,\mathbb{C})$?]]></description>
