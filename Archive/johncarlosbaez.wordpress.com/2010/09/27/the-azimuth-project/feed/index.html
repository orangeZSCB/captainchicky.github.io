Although I guess this discussion is drifting further afield, it is worth mentioning than implementations of statistical inference techniques based on Kullback-Leibler treatment of priors is most widely distributed in commercial software for image processing, such as ERDAS IMAGINE commonly used in ecological studies. For these purposes people generally use variations such the Transformed Divergence because they work better. I find that I can manipulate distributions (e.g. enforce convergence) much better using a Jensen-Shannon metric than other measures.

FWIW, i.e. 0, it is possible to get an unemergent unmicroscopic version of entropic dynamics of metrics, with square roots of determinants etc., having nothing to do with coordinates.]]></description>

Right. maxent (without Capitals, if that&#039;s warmer and fuzzier) methods are not just for static inference. They are routinely used for example in *predictive* risk software, not just for physical systems, and as dropdown menu items in commercial operations research software. Entropy of data is there a selectable function, among others that often work better, to *incrementally* maximize.

A little more of my background. As a sometime student of Norman Packard, as a complex systems class project in 1988 he gave me some dozens of gigabytes of meteorology data, of which the data of interest involved the global dynamics of ozone. One of several predictive analyses I did was to maximize the change in an information measure from timepoint to timepoint, copying algorithms from a student of Jaynes. Another analysis that also did not work at all well used a Kalman filter I wrote, but I did not write a good Kalman filter until 1993. Anyway only ad hoc time series analysis worked well. He may remember that I used his account to overutilize the supercomputer facilities. The reason for saying all that was that over 20 years ago maximum entropy production (again, maybe without CapiTals) was well known enough to be suggested as a classroom application for complex systems analysis.]]></description>

Although presumably my quick scan method for responding to keywords is flawed, Iâ€™m not sure what precision is required to discern between the remark that maxent is a routinely implemented method for complex systems analysis and some requested remark on whether maxent principles have been used to shed light on complex systems.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sorry &#8212; I could be confused, but I was trying to distinguish between:

1) the quite routine use of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_maximum_entropy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&#039;MaxEnt methods&#039;&lt;/a&gt; in statistical inference &#8212; where you roughly try to choose the &#039;least committal&#039; hypothesis that fits the given data

and 

2) the apparently more obscure &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rsbs.anu.edu.au/ResearchGroups/EBG/profiles/Roderick_Dewar/Martyushev%20and%20Seleznev%202006%20Phys%20Rep.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&#039;Principle of Maximum Entropy Production&#039;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/macroscopic.prediction.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&#039;Principle of Maximum Caliber&#039;&lt;/a&gt; in nonequilibrium thermodynamics, which says roughly that a physical system will do whatever it can to produce as much entropy as possible.  

It&#039;s the latter that Robert and Charlie and I are wondering about.

Now, I won&#039;t be surprised to discover that these are ultimately just two faces of the same coin.  But still, right now, 1) seems fairly clear to me, while 2) seems shrouded in mystery &#8212; especially because Prigogine has successfully used a principle of &lt;i&gt;least&lt;/i&gt; entropy production in his work on nonequilibrium thermodynamics!

Now, thanks to your remark, I just found a paper that claims &#039;MaxEnt&#039; and the &#039;Principle of Maximum Entropy Production&#039; &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;are&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; two faces of the same coin:

&#8226; Robert Niven, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.0990&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Jaynes&#039; MaxEnt, Steady State Flow Systems and the Maximum Entropy Production Principle&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Jaynes&#039; maximum entropy (MaxEnt) principle was recently used to give a conditional, local derivation of the &quot;maximum entropy production&quot; (MEP) principle, which states that a flow system with fixed flow(s) or gradient(s) will converge to a steady state of maximum production of thermodynamic entropy (R.K. Niven, Phys. Rev. E, in press). The analysis provides a steady state analog of the MaxEnt formulation of equilibrium thermodynamics, applicable to many complex flow systems at steady state. The present study examines the classification of physical systems, with emphasis on the choice of constraints in MaxEnt. The discussion clarifies the distinction between equilibrium, fluid flow, source/sink, flow/reactive and other systems, leading into an appraisal of the application of MaxEnt to steady state flow and reactive systems. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And he even has references listing applications to climate change.  So, I need to read this and try to understand it.

(Btw, my descriptions of &#039;MaxEnt methods&#039; and the &#039;Principle of Maximum Entropy Production&#039; were very rough &#8212; just enough to distinguish them, I hope.)]]></description>

If you are focusing on dynamics for climate, for instance

is the first Google hit. Maxent works ok. Just isn&#039;t necessarily the best, etc.]]></description>

No expert, but maximum entropy routines are, well, *routine*. Essentially every numerical modeling system appropriate for complex systems analyses implements a variety of maximum entropy methods. Jaynes was a maxent harbinger and strong proponent, but not first or only.

To repeat myself in a different way, to always use maximum entropy (nee maximum likelihood) approaches commits the same error as always using greedy algorithms (e.g. for the vertex cover problem). And for the same reasons, even though they are provably suboptimal, in the &quot;real world&quot; both maxent and greedy approaches are used every day because they work.]]></description>
