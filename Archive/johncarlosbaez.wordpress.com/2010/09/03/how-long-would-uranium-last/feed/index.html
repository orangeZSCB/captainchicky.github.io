					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/09/03/how-long-would-uranium-last/#comment-1033&quot;&gt;bane&lt;/a&gt;.

bane says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... writing a full, detailed rebuttal paper), making me doubt everybody :-( . So the academic paper ...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The &quot;academic paper&quot; link times out. However, some other papers that were recent two years ago are mentioned in this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iaea.org/OurWork/ST/NE/NEFW/documents/RawMaterials/TM_Vienna2009/presentations/22_Tamada_Japan.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;slideshow (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;.

The way I look at it is, the polymer they soak in the ocean has combustion energy nearly equal to its weight in oil, and -- p. 17 -- it is repeatedly used to fish, typically, 0.004 times its own mass of uranium out of the sea. On each run, then, it delivers 0.004*14000, i.e. 56, times its combustion energy.

This is consistent with the estimated price on that page: $260/kg, $2.6 per barrel-oil-equivalent. Not competitive with land-based mining operations that now are getting $134/kg, and in some cases spending much less, but a lot closer to competitiveness than used to be the case.

Maybe someone has information more recent than 2009.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dr. Brook has linked back here.

Too many comments, but Ctrl+F doesn&#039;t show me any mention of Alberta or the tarsands.

They are useful as an existence proof: about 80 percent net energy can be had from tarsands that are six mass percent tar. Or six percent oil, if you prefer to call them oilsands, as I think they who work there do.

Approximating tar&#039;s energy as 40 MJ/kg, that tells us 2.4 MJ/kg, two-thirds of a kilowatt-hour, of fuel energy in a fuel ore is enough for an adequately high fraction to be net.

Now, in CANDU reactors, natural uranium typically yields 164 thermal MWh/kg (so said a leaflet I was given when I visited the Darlington station near me a few years ago). So we can estimate how much extractable uranium an ore must contain to be as good as the tarsands, net-energy-wise: two-thirds over 164000. Four ppm.

That&#039;s a little higher than uranium abundance&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/hep-ph/pdf/0501/0501111v2.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;2.2-to-2.8-ppm range in upper continental crust&lt;/a&gt;, but probably not so much as to disqualify average crust as a net-energy-yielding uranium ore. After all, some older CANDUs burned their natural UO2 longer, up to ~250 thermal MWh/kg, back when commercial uranium ore grades were not so high as they are today.

Another way to test the potential, as uranium ore, of average stuff underfoot is to compare its (Darlington-relative) U energy content, 2.2e(-6) times 164 thermal MWh/kg, 360 thermal Wh/kg, with the comminution energy cost of hard rock, ~25 electrical Wh, ~75 thermal Wh, per kg. This gives the same sort of net fraction, (360-75)/360, 0.8.

Data sources and effective analytical approaches are becoming more and more apparent.

					<description><![CDATA[Yay!  It looks like Barry Brook is doing a detailed analysis of various scenarios for nuclear power over on his blog &lt;a href=&quot;http://bravenewclimate.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;BraveNewClimate&lt;/a&gt;!  This should really help us figure things out.

Here are the posts so far:

&lt;a href=&quot;http://bravenewclimate.com/2010/09/28/2060-nuclear-scenarios-p1/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Scenarios for nuclear power to 2060&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;http://bravenewclimate.com/2010/09/29/2060-nuclear-scenarios-p2/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;SNE 2060 – thermal reactor build rates, uranium use and cost&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;http://bravenewclimate.com/2010/10/14/2060-nuclear-scenarios-p3/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;SNE 2060 – are uranium resources sufficient?&lt;/a&gt;

He&#039;s studying four scenarios, two previously considered by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.world-nuclear.org/outlook/clean_energy_need.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;World Nuclear Association&lt;/a&gt; in their report called the &quot;Nuclear Century Outlook&quot; (or &quot;NCO&quot;).   But he doesn&#039;t buy all their assumptions.  He considers the fourth of his scenarios most plausible:

1. NCOL: NCO Low Scenario (anchoring to 602 GW in 2030 and 1140 GW in 2060)

2. NCOH: NCO High scenario (1350 GW in 2030, 3688 GW in 2060)

3. TR1: A mid-growth scenario that tracks between NCO Low and High, but which peaks at around 2050 and slowly declines thereafter

4. TR2: A high-growth scenario that is identical to NCO High through to 2030, after which the relative growth rate slows only gradually (absolute number of GW per year continues to increase).]]></description>
