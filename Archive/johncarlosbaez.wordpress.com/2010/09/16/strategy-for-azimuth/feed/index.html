That&#039;s a cool article.  I&#039;m glad someone is trying an experiment!  I think the people who don&#039;t want to even try experiments in geoengineering are overly optimistic: overly optimistic that we can solve the global warming problem without exploring all possible options.  ]]></description>

Don&#039;t be sorry about commenting on old posts!  I put a lot of work into my posts and I&#039;d like to continue discussions on all of them.  I think you&#039;re referring to my interview with Gregory Benford in &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/02/28/this-weeks-finds-week-310/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Week 310&lt;/a&gt; of This Week&#039;s Finds---that was our main discussion of geoengineering so far.  It&#039;s actually very relevant to our current discussion of &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/09/01/melting-permafrost/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;melting permafrost&lt;/a&gt;, since Benford suggests doing experiments to test the feasibility of keeping the Arctic cold by putting sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere over the Arctic.  This could be the best way to keep the permafrost from melting and releasing lots of greenhouse gases.

I&#039;ll read this &lt;i&gt;Guardian&lt;/i&gt; article and try to comment on it.  Thanks!]]></description>

John, I know you&#039;re busy, and thanks for taking the time to explain fusion to me via http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_binding_energy.  I see from your hovercard that you&#039;re working on Quantum Technologies.  Cool!
Your first two points are easily settled:  

Almost everyone believes that life can ultimately be explained by the laws of Physics, in a very straightforward way: Physics explains Chemistry which explains life through DNA.  Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen state this forthrightly in their excellent book The Collapse of Chaos, and they also clearly explains what `explain&#039; means: there is some explanation (basically a proof) using the laws of Physics (or Chemistry, if you will), a proof that might be so long that humans will never discover it.  They say that Complexity Theory really ought to be called Simplicity Theory, as it&#039;s basically a branch of Mathematical Logic trying to prove some version of the Goedel Incompleteness Theorem, and that we await a real Complexity Theory that will involve geometry as in e.g. Catastrophe Theory.

I&#039;m only willing to doubt that Physics-explains-life to speculate that we&#039;re missing key laws of Physics, perhaps the non-local laws that Paul Davies The Fifth Miracle: : The Search for the Origin and Meaning of Life.  If you don&#039;t want to discuss this, fine; you&#039;re the physicist.  I&#039;m not willing to speculate about souls or vital forces being needed.  I couldn&#039;t get very far.  My important point is that Physics-explains-life is a conjecture that we&#039;re not close having a compelling argument for.  We don&#039;t e.g. know enough about genes.  It&#039;s importance to recognize the weakness of the Physics-explains-life dogma in order to speculate about our chances to pull off the Biotech miracles that I think we&#039;ll need to beat the Ecocrisis.  I&#039;m hoping of course that such a theoretical discussion will actually pay off with better Biotech.  But even if it doesn&#039;t, the beliefs (which I think are uninformed and unfounded) that people, businesses &#038; governments have about Physics-explains-life are really important in politics of Global Warming and environmentalism.  To give one example, Dyson says we&#039;re free to burn coal now because we&#039;ll have carbon-gobbling trees in 50 years.]]></description>

Okay, now I understand what you mean by a &#039;scientific phenomenon&#039;.  

I&#039;m trying to become more practical these days, so I don&#039;t have much enthusiasm for a discussion about whether life can ultimately be explained by the laws of physics.  

One key problem here is agreeing on a definition of &#039;explained&#039;, and that promises to be a lengthy and tiresome business.  

Another problem is that it&#039;s hard to definitively settle questions about &#039;what we can ultimately do, even though we can&#039;t do it now&#039;.  

So, I&#039;ll just say this: I&#039;m optimistic that we already know all the fundamental laws of physics that we&#039;ll need to know in our study of life on Earth.

(Here &#039;fundamental law&#039; has a specific technical meaning that physicists know.  I am &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; saying that we know enough physics yet: for example, we probably need to get a lot better at nonequilibrium thermodynamics.  Nor am I claiming that we&#039;ll ever &#039;explain&#039; life using physics: for that, again, we&#039;d need first to agree on a definition of &#039;explain&#039;.)  

I&#039;ve gotta run... more later.]]></description>

It might be you&#039;re using a term which unbeknowst to you has a specific technical meaning: a noncomputable (or uncomputable) decision problem is one for which, over an entire infinite set of possible inputs a computer program cannot always yield a yes/no answer. This is different from the issues in chaos where you can&#039;t track with finite precision arithmetic the detailed behaviour from a given starting point for unbounded time. However, in principle there&#039;s nothing stopping you tracking an initial state to a given finite time if you&#039;re allowed to restart with increased arithmetic precision each time you detect it&#039;s insufficient (excepting cases of exact singularities in the maths).

However, even if you did mean genuinely non-computable it&#039;s not clear whether that&#039;s meaningful in a situation where (depending what physics actually turns out to be) you&#039;ve got a finite number of elements behaving for a finite number of timesteps.

The final point that I&#039;d make is it&#039;s not clear that a &quot;genetic program&quot; metaphor, with numerous extensions, has been a failure explaining the &quot;procedures of life&quot;: it just hasn&#039;t been a comprehensive success yet, but it&#039;s not clear that this isn&#039;t due to the scale of the task, which vastly exceeds almost all of the tasks considered in physics and chemistry.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/09/16/strategy-for-azimuth/#comment-1757&quot;&gt;John Baez&lt;/a&gt;.

John B, thanks for the interesting post about the exciting new developments in Biology that show how little we know.  By a `scientific phenomenon&#039;, I mean a phenomenon that can ultimately be explained by the laws Physics.  I don&#039;t of course mean that we human scientists possess such an explanation.  To give a simple example from Ian Stewart&#039;s book &lt;i&gt;The Collapse of Chaos&lt;/i&gt;, everyone believes that the salt cubic crystal structure has a Quantum Mechanics explanation, but no one knows what it is. I did not speak metaphorically about `programs&#039;, and neither did Keller or the luminaries she quotes, even if you can easily refute the notion of a genetic program.  I didn&#039;t understand your `open quantum system,&#039; but your interaction with the environment is not a refutation: a program may take data.  The concept of `program&#039; is quite relevant, if we&#039;re going to talk about how biology is discussed in the media and in classrooms.  A grade school book recently written contained the wildly false statement every trait is controlled by one gene.  A middle school biology text falsely stated that the gene is the fundamental unit of heredity.  You said you would refute this, but folks believe it.  I&#039;ll talk about whatever you like, but maybe we ought to talk about genes in public discourse, as your Azimuth project seems to involve trying to change how folk think.

We&#039;re having some confusion because I was responding to others, which I&#039;ll try not to do anymore (folks can find me on the net if they like), but I said I&#039;d discuss &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ias.ac.in/jbiosci/feb2005/3.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Keller&#039;s 2005 followup&lt;/a&gt; to her book &lt;i&gt;The Century of the Gene&lt;/i&gt; (CotG).  I found her article to be revolutionary and controversial, as she continues her CotG opposition to `reductionism&#039; but is skeptical about the new highly touted `systems biology.&#039;

On p 3, Keller repeats her ending to CotG, that Gelbart wrote that ``the term `gene&#039; ... might in fact be a hindrance to our understanding.&#039;&#039;  Sec 3 starts with Keller continuing in her CotG vein with, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
``The human genome has been sequenced, but it has failed to tell us who we are.&#039;&#039;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the top of page 4, Keller explains that genes (partial protein recipes) are even more partial than CotG said, as there are proteins for which ``no corresponding sequence can be found on the DNA even after shuffling and splicing.&#039;&#039;

Sec 5 begins with Brenner arguing ``that the prime intellectual task of the future lies in constructing an appropriate theoretical framework for biology&#039;&#039;.  Keller writes, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
``Will `Systems Biology&#039; provide us with such a framework? The answer, I think, is no.&#039;&#039;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Keller writes glowingly about new interdisciplinary progress toward Systems Biology, following her long habit of encouraging new approaches, but at the end makes it clear that she feels no new paradigm has really arisen: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
``What will it take to bring the genome to life, to formulate an appropriate theoretical framework for understanding living systems?&#039;&#039;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So as in her books, Keller&#039;s article gives persuasive evidence that there is no compelling evidence that life is a scientific phenomenon at all, even though she does not make this point, and seems very much to believe that organisms are chemical reactions.

I certainly thought Chaos implies uncomputability.  If you have sensitive dependence on initial conditions, then any computer trajectories will be inacurate soon enough.  Did you mean that if you stay away from the `chaotic regions&#039; that you can do reasonable long term computer models?  I&#039;d agree with that, but I didn&#039;t know that collisions were the source of 3-body problem Chaos.  I only like noncomputability because the non-metaphorical genetic program has been such a failure to explain life as a scientific phenomenon.]]></description>

<p>We&#8217;re having some confusion because I was responding to others, which I&#8217;ll try not to do anymore (folks can find me on the net if they like), but I said I&#8217;d discuss <a href="http://www.ias.ac.in/jbiosci/feb2005/3.pdf" rel="nofollow">Keller&#8217;s 2005 followup</a> to her book <i>The Century of the Gene</i> (CotG).  I found her article to be revolutionary and controversial, as she continues her CotG opposition to `reductionism&#8217; but is skeptical about the new highly touted `systems biology.&#8217;</p>
<p>On p 3, Keller repeats her ending to CotG, that Gelbart wrote that &#8220;the term `gene&#8217; &#8230; might in fact be a hindrance to our understanding.&#8221;  Sec 3 starts with Keller continuing in her CotG vein with, </p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;The human genome has been sequenced, but it has failed to tell us who we are.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>On the top of page 4, Keller explains that genes (partial protein recipes) are even more partial than CotG said, as there are proteins for which &#8220;no corresponding sequence can be found on the DNA even after shuffling and splicing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sec 5 begins with Brenner arguing &#8220;that the prime intellectual task of the future lies in constructing an appropriate theoretical framework for biology&#8221;.  Keller writes, </p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;Will `Systems Biology&#8217; provide us with such a framework? The answer, I think, is no.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Keller writes glowingly about new interdisciplinary progress toward Systems Biology, following her long habit of encouraging new approaches, but at the end makes it clear that she feels no new paradigm has really arisen: </p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;What will it take to bring the genome to life, to formulate an appropriate theoretical framework for understanding living systems?&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>So as in her books, Keller&#8217;s article gives persuasive evidence that there is no compelling evidence that life is a scientific phenomenon at all, even though she does not make this point, and seems very much to believe that organisms are chemical reactions.</p>
<p>I certainly thought Chaos implies uncomputability.  If you have sensitive dependence on initial conditions, then any computer trajectories will be inacurate soon enough.  Did you mean that if you stay away from the `chaotic regions&#8217; that you can do reasonable long term computer models?  I&#8217;d agree with that, but I didn&#8217;t know that collisions were the source of 3-body problem Chaos.  I only like noncomputability because the non-metaphorical genetic program has been such a failure to explain life as a scientific phenomenon.</p>

Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra. 

The point I am trying to communicate by &quot;the genomic program is well understood&quot; on the one hand and &quot;they are working on the transcriptome&quot; on the other hand is maybe better communicated by the Tamarian example illustrating the inherent difficulties of machine translation in the context of (wait for it) context. But let me emphasize again that both the code and machinery of the genomic code are very well understood, mostly because they are easy to get at: DNA is easily extracted with combinations of detergent and hot water, and it wants to express itself, including bits and pieces.

For years it has been as if there had been millions of examples of hieroglyphs, lots of Rosetta stones, and many scribes. Initially somebody with gumption would work on understanding how automate the translating process. And they did - all of the translating process, all of the code, coding, decoding, is all understood.]]></description>
