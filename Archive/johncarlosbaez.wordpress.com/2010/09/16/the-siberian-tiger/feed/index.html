					<description><![CDATA[&#8226; Rowan Jacobson, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/nature/Number-One-With-a-Bullet.html?page=all&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Number one with a bullet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Outside&lt;/i&gt;, 30 August 2011.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
What does India’s lush Kaziranga National Park have that the rest of the country’s decimated reserves do not? Plenty of tigers, for starters. (The world’s highest ­density.) Fleets of endangered one-horned rhinos. (More than two-thirds of the remaining population.) And, since last year, a take-no-prisoners antipoaching policy that allows rangers to shoot on sight. Welcome to the future of conservation. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Is the shoot-on-sight policy really the main reason for the success of Kaziranga National Park, or is this article hyping that policy because it will excite the American hunters who subscribe to &lt;i&gt;Outside&lt;/i&gt;?   I don&#039;t know.  But the article certainly does succeed in giving wildlife conservation a badass image:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
To keep the megafauna capital of the universe going strong, it helps to shoot first and ask questions later.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have heard that Siberian tigers are bigger than the African lions. The African lion weighs 500 pounds on average, while The Siberian tiger weighs 600 pounds. Is it true? I just found this information on 

http://www.ligerworld.com/weighing-liger-vs-tiger-vs-lion.html 

Is this true? I have browsed a lot of websites online, some rate lions as bigger than tigers while some rate tigers as bigger than lion. Who is bigger? Just so much confused?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Locally on the island of Anglesey where I live, there has been a drive to reinstate the native red squirrel (see http://www.redsquirrels.info/).  Thirty years ago red squirrels were common but then grey squirrels from the mainland came across the bridges. A few years ago there were virtually no reds left. 

A project to reintroduce reds after eradication of the non-native greys was put forward and although the few local reds were judged to be of a slightly different race the fact that there were very few left suggested that their genetic diversity was insufficient to maintain that race separately.  Squirrels from several of the few remaining natural colonies in the UK were reared and then carefully released into various parts of the island some 3 or 4 years ago. The population seems now to be about 300 whilst it was in the twenties before the `reintroduction&#039;.  The full story can be followed via that link I think. The key as suggested above would seem to be genetic diversity not just habitat retention.]]></description>

Adding to Zoran&#039;s comment, the three programme series was shown recently on the BBC. Fantastic. Tigers way up higher than ever anyone seems to have guessed.  The filming is marvellous, and the programmes should be marked TO SEE if they come your way. In the mean time the BBC website that Zoran linked to has some information and clips. This was all in  Bhutan but made me wonder if there were other high altitude tigers elsewhere in the rest of their old range.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/09/16/the-siberian-tiger/#comment-1532&quot;&gt;Tim van Beek&lt;/a&gt;.

When an interesting story appears in &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt;, their publicity team makes sure it shows up in the news all over.  Here&#039;s a news story about the Florida panther:

&#8226; Christopher Joyce, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130078633&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Bounding, rebounding: panthers make a comeback&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Morning Edition&lt;/i&gt;, National Public Radio, September 24, 2010.

A quote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

By 1995, there were only about 25 Florida panthers left. And Melody Roelke, a veterinarian who has tracked them for years, says they were a mess: suffering from heart disease, infertility and undescended testicles.

&quot;[With] the males, even with one testis, the quality of that sperm was just abysmal,&quot; she says. They just couldn&#039;t reproduce. &quot;We were actually watching the extinction process right in front of our eyes. And this is what happens with small populations and inbreeding of close relatives.&quot;

[...]

... a geneticist who studies big carnivores, Stephen O&#039;Brien of the National Cancer Institute, devised a plan to save the panthers: He combined genetics and math to calculate the panther&#039;s fate.

&quot;They were going to go extinct in 25 years with a 99 percent probability if we left them alone,&quot; he says. &quot;That&#039;s what stimulated the decision to act, to intervene.&quot;

He helped persuade the federal government to capture eight female pumas in Texas and release them in Florida to mate with the panthers.

That was a controversial move. The Endangered Species Act advises against mixing subspecies (here, for example, pumas and panthers). But O&#039;Brien argued that Eastern and Western pumas had been interbreeding for millennia before highways and housing developments intervened: This would not be a &quot;man-made&quot; creature.

Others said, &quot;Why bother?&quot; — there were enough pumas out West. O&#039;Brien countered that subspecies may have traits developed within their isolated habitat that make them special. Even Darwin, he says, believed that subspecies could, under the right circumstances, become a unique species someday.

So the Texas cats came to Florida. 

[...]

Before the Texas females arrived, the Florida panthers were, according to Roelke, pretty lame. &quot;They would be lying there in the tree like, &#039;Oh, just let me just die up here,&#039; because they lacked any kind of vigor.&quot;

Now, 15 years later, O&#039;Brien says the Florida panther is a new cat. &quot;I think we can say cautiously that it was the right decision,&quot; he says. &quot;The population increased in number threefold. The admixture cats, which are hybrids, are more robust and they look a little bit like Arnold Schwarzenegger versions of cats.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
