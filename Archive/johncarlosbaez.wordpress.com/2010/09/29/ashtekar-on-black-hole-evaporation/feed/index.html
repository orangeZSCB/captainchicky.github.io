					<description><![CDATA[Hi Tim van Beek

It appears that my abuse of jargon is confusing - primarily to myself.

With regard to the black hole that either radiates or it doesn&#039;t, pretty obviously, I should have said it was in a pure state or a mixed state. So we have two possibilities:
1 - The hole is in a pure state.
Then as John Baez instructs us, it will not radiate. So any information about the past of the hole is locked away. The information is effectively lost.
2 - The hole is in a mixed state.
It radiates as a black body. All we learn from the blackbody radiation is the temperature of the hole and, according Hawking and Bekenstein, also the mass. All other information is lost to us.

Regarding special relativity and nonlocality, I suppose I should have used the phrase &quot;relativistic causality&quot;. I can readily Lorentz transform spacelike lines which would represent faster than light motion, and so in that sense relativity is compatible with nonlocality. I get causality within this framework by connecting events by timeike lines in their historical order. Relativistic causality rules matter, energy, and information. But he correlated noise is effectively acausal.

Re: Stanford Encyclopedia of Physics . It is telling us that information loss is associated with entropy gain. This is compatible with the enormous entropy that a black hole possesses. If the information of the matter-energy within the hole could be restored, what would happen to the entropy created by its loss? Removing this entropy would be a violation of thermodynamic law.

Regarding information coming from within an event horizon. This would violate causality. This is because inside the horizon, inwards is a timelike direction. But that doesn&#039;t matter. The horizon takes literally forever to form, unless you have the viewpoint of someone falling in.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;

I had read some of the chapter of Semi-Riemannian geometry, but I stopped.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
There are many different levels of understanding and reading is not a linear process. I usually skip a few later chapters, re-read chapters after some time, write down questions that I cannot answer (yet), try some excercises, fail, find another book about the same topic, start reading that etc.

When I was a student I was under the impression that one should learn the material as it is presented in the classroom, understand everything and pass the exams, then turn to the next topic etc...but once you stop attending classes after your graduation you&#039;ll see that this is just one of many ways and maybe not the best one for everyone.]]></description>

I assume JB refers to “Gauge Fields, Knots, and Gravity”...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yes, that&#039;s the one.

Another nice (but more mathematically sophisticated) introduction to the Palatini formalism is the thesis of my student Derek Wise, &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/thesis_wise.pdf#page=155&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;starting around page 155&lt;/a&gt;.

You shouldn&#039;t stop reading my book merely because you can&#039;t do all the exercises.  If I had only read books where I could do all the exercises, I would have read very few books.  Usually I&#039;m satisfied if the results &quot;seem true&quot;.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;

You can read about the Palatini approach in Wald’s book, or my book.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I assume JB refers to &quot;Gauge Fields, Knots, and Gravity&quot;, listed as no. 3 under books &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/papers.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

The problem with this kind of question is that some physics faculties don&#039;t have professors that know enough about both QFT and GR to explain these kinds of connections.]]></description>

Thank you very much!
I stopped reading your book few months ago, because the exercises in the chapter of fibre bundle look difficult for me; though the results seems to be true, I just couldn&#039;t prove them in rigorous maths.
I had read some of the chapter of Semi-Riemannian geometry, but I stopped.]]></description>

You might like the Palatini approach to gravity, which treats the connection and &#039;frame field&#039; as equally independent quantities, both fundamental.  The frame field determines the metric.  You can read about the Palatini approach in Wald&#039;s book, or my book.  Ashtekar&#039;s approach, which led to loop quantum gravity, is a further development along these lines.   I also explain all that in my book.  

For a quick &lt;i&gt;free&lt;/i&gt; introduction to all this stuff and how it gets used in loop quantum gravity, you could try &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9504036&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.  But it&#039;s a bit mathematical.]]></description>

JB said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;

1. I’m very happy to have you discuss the black hole entropy puzzle.

2. I will put up with you discussing the interpretation of quantum mechanics.

3. I’d rather you wouldn’t discuss why I didn’t delete a comment in time to prevent precisely such a discussion.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

1. Ok, I&#039;m mostly interested in AQFT on curved spacetimes and started to write about it a while back, when I had more time, on the nLab: &lt;a href=&quot;http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/AQFT+on+curved+spacetimes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;AQFT on curved spacetimes&lt;/a&gt;. Remarkably Robert Wald presents a derivation of Hawking radiation in his textbook mentioned there. I did not have a look at Hawkings latest calculations, but I doubt that its translation to the AQFT formulation can be done, given the state of things. It would be nice to now the opinion of the AQFT community about this...

2. My interest in interpretations of QM is quite limited, but I&#039;m happy to join a discussion if I can contribute. I&#039;d guess that there are more appropriate places to discuss this anyway. BTW: It&#039;s a basic anchorman technique to tell people &quot;you will have the oportunity to discuss this over there, later, but meanwhile let&#039;s get back to our main topic.&quot; in order to curtail an off-topic discussion).

3. Sorry.]]></description>
