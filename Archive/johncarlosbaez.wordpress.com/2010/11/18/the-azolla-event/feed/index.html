&lt;blockquote&gt; have increased by 15°C in two steps separated by several decades, with magnitudes of 7-8°C &lt;/blockquote&gt;

I looked for a link, but it&#039;s already on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Younger+Dryas&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;! A paper by Grachev and Severinghaus is linked that claims a $10 \pm 4$ °C change in temperature.

Btw:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
the Younger Dryas does not seem to have been a world-wide event (though this has been heavily debated).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

&lt;i&gt;&quot;As for “life”, I will keep that, because I know it’s already having trouble keeping pace with global warming.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;

Life have all kinds of trouble all the time, but I doubt it has anything to do with the pace of current warming.

About 10,500 years ago, at the end of Younger Dryas average temperatures over Greenland have increased by 15&#176;C in two steps separated by several decades, with magnitudes of 7-8&#176;C and durations less than 10 years each. That&#039;s ten times faster than rate of current change, still, the biosphere has survived somehow.

At the same time sea level went up by dozens of meters (more than 120 meters since 18,000 years ago). It means all the magnificent coral reefs we currently have are younger than ten thousand years; the old reefs have drowned, they had to re-grow over previously dry land. It is practically the same with all our temperate and boreal forests. The area occupied by them right now used to be covered with miles thick ice sheets or subarctic desert.

Life is durable, local ecosystems are not so much.]]></description>

Yup.  In pure mathematics we do that all the time &#8212; but luckily few people pay attention to pure mathematics, so the damage is minimal!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;(“Optimum?” Yes: as if the arguments over global warming weren’t confusing enough already, paleontologists use the term “optimum” for any peak of high temperatures. I think that’s a bit silly.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term &quot;optimum&quot; comes from Climatology and calling it silly is a silliness in itself. Basic knowledge of climate dynamics tells you why.

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/11/18/the-azolla-event/#comment-2699&quot;&gt;John Baez&lt;/a&gt;.

By the way, the polar amplification issue brings up an interesting puzzle in paleoclimate, which is the meridional or pole-to-equator temperature gradient problem.

If you go back to some greenhouse periods such as the early Paleogene, the poles were much warmer than today, but the tropics weren&#039;t that much warmer.  The difference between polar and tropical surface temperatures, or meridional temperature gradient, was smaller back then &#038;mash; maybe a 15 °C difference instead of the modern ~30 °C difference.

The problem is that we are unable to explain the magnitude of this reduced temperature gradient using our climate models, even though those models do predict polar amplification of warming.  This implies that we are missing some positive feedback which is active near the poles, or possibly some negative feedback which is active near the tropics.  Maybe clouds, or alterations in meridional ocean heat transport.

This is related to hypothesis about a &quot;tropical thermostat&quot;.  This is contentious and some have argued that the gradient wasn&#039;t really as small as some people think.  One classic paper is &lt;a href=&quot;http://geology.gsapubs.org/content/30/4/299.abstract&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Norris et al.&lt;/a&gt;, one can work forward from there.

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pages-igbp.org/products/newsletters/2008-1/Special%20Section/Science%20Highlights/Sluijs_2008-1%289-11%29.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Appy Sluijs&lt;/a&gt; discussed this problem with respect to the PETM, as has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencemag.org/content/321/5887/353.summary&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Huber&lt;/a&gt; (and a &lt;a href=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;blog entry&lt;/a&gt;); also &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2010/2010GL043468.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt;.

I even found &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2010.07.026&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;a paper&lt;/a&gt; discussing its impact on isotope proxies during the Azolla event.

Abbott and Tziperman have discussed polar cloud feedbacks &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.211/abstract&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/2008JAS2840.1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencemag.org/content/320/5873/195.abstract&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Kump and Pollard&lt;/a&gt; have also discussed cloud feedbacks, more to get the overall magnitude of the climate right than to explain the temperature gradient, IIRC.

This isn&#039;t really my area and so I don&#039;t have a coherent overview or collection of references.  These are just papers I&#039;ve happened across.]]></description>
