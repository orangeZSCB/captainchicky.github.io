Ok!

Btw, because you&#039;re mentioning natural gas: if you are by any chance an expert in chemistry, your expertise could be valuable here. E.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Methanol+economy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt; Methanol economy &lt;/a&gt; is an interesting idea, but needs to be discussed in more detail on the wiki.]]></description>

I&#039;m not sure since I&#039;m also stuck behind pay walls. You can contact the author and ask if he&#039;ll provide more detail on the subject or maybe a copy of what he cited.

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101201/full/468601a.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Globalization means that Earth&#039;s life-support system can no longer be treated as separate from the socio–economic system, says Sybil Seitzinger&lt;/a&gt;

&quot;In Frank Herbert&#039;s 1965 science-fiction classic Dune, the number-one position on the planet is held not by a politician, but by a planetary ecologist. His job is to oversee the long-term conversion of the desert planet to a lush biosphere — a role demanding formidable far-sightedness.&quot;

&quot;On Earth, the human population is set to top 9 billion within two generations. Meanwhile, we are altering, in profound and uncontrolled ways, key biological, physical and chemical processes of ecosystems on which this growing population will depend. Gordon Conway, former head of the Rockefeller Foundation, once suggested that Earth should appoint a planetary ecologist of its own. Given that today&#039;s policy-makers have consistently demonstrated an inability to take more than a short-term view of life on Earth, perhaps it is time to take the idea seriously.&quot;

&quot;The number-one position on Earth at present is arguably that of head of the United Nations (UN). Ban Ki-moon, the current UN secretary-general, seems to understand the scale and nature of the problem much better than his predecessors. This is welcome, but is still not enough. Indeed, it is doubtful whether a UN system shackled by national self-interest can ever set out a vision for a sustainable planet, or a sensible plan to realize it.&quot;

&quot;Policy-makers must take on board that Earth&#039;s ecology acts as a complex and nonlinear system, and is in a constant state of change. And they must recognize that to fully understand this system, they need to take a long-term view. Is this so different from acknowledging the complexity and timescales of the world economy?...&quot;]]></description>

I don&#039;t think it&#039;s just a &quot;diversion&quot;  because you can do a lot of other things with methanol besides burning it. It&#039;s a feedstock and precursor for lots of organic compounds. On page 247 of Beyond Oil and Gas: The Methanol Economy&quot;, Olah, Goeppert, and Surya Prakash, Wiley-VCH (2006), ISBN 3-527-31275-7, the following list:

Methanol ----&#062;   Formaldehyde  ----&#062; Isoprene (precursor to rubber)
                     Methyl Tertiary-butyl Ether
                     Acetic Acid, and Acetic Anhydride
                     Ethanol
                     Chloro- and Halomethanes

                     Methyl Methacrylate
                     Methyl Formate
                     Methyl Amines

                     Dimethyl Terephthalate ----&#062;  polyethyleneterephthalate (PET)

OK, I could have sworn that there was a disproportionation reaction to produce methanol from methane and CO2, and there is on page 241 of &quot;Beyond Oil and Gas: The Methanol Economy&quot;, Olah, Goeppert, and Surya Prakash, Wiley-VCH (2006), ISBN 3-527-31275-7, the following:

Methane Decomposition      CH4  ----&#062;  C   +  2H2   (900degC, no air or N2)

Methanol Synthesis           CO2  +  3H2  ----&#062;  CH3OH  +  H2O

Overall Reaction              3CH4 +  2CO2  -----&#062;  2CH3OH + 2H2O + 3C

There&#039;s already chemistry being done in flow reactors in industrial flue gases to reduce nitric oxides - and the same thing goes on in catalytic converters in cars:

http://www.energysolutionscenter.org/boilerburner/Workshop/RCTFlueGasTreatment.htm

And these flue gases are at the ideal temp for methane decomposition, so maybe the way to go about this is to run the coal bed methane, which is usually flared off, through a heat exchanger running alongside the flue to bring its temperature up to that of the flue gas, then do the decomposition, collect the molecular carbon as carbon black (which might contain a fair amount of fullerenes), and then react the hot H2 with the flue gases, comprised mostly of nitric oxides and CO2, to get ammonia/urea compounds, water (as superheated steam) and methanol. Run this mixture through a condenser and you could get reagent-grade methanol, distilled water, ammonia, and urea, all of which are useful... See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea for example.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Los Alamos&#039;s magazine, Nov 2010, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lanl.gov/science/1663/issues/november2010.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&quot;Metagenomics&quot;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Researchers envision a variety of practical applications to come from metagenomics in the future, with many of these applications addressing critical human needs. In each of the following examples, rapid metagenomic studies of the relevant microbial community could allow us to duplicate, harness, or expand upon the special capabilities of microbes.
Medicine: Many drugs in widespread use today, such as antibiotics, derive from microbes or plants, but most of this natural biodiversity remains untapped. Metagenomic exploration of the remaining biodiversity could lead to the rapid discovery of new medicines. Additionally, the community of bacteria living in and on the human body, especially in the intestine, plays a major role in the regulation of human health. Using metagenomics to examine this community could vastly improve our understanding of nutrition and disease.&quot;

&quot;Climate: A bacterial group called cyanobacteria, largely in the oceans, performs about half of all photosynthesis on Earth. That, together with carbon cycling by soil microorganisms, exerts a substantial influence on the atmosphere and therefore the climate. Metagenomics is already helping us begin to understand the role of microbes in climate change and may help us identify species and enzymes capable of slowing or reversing that change.&quot;

Metagenomics to the Rescue

&quot;Bioenergy: Cellulosic ethanol, a renewable fuel resource, is manufactured from plant cellulose found in agricultural waste, such as corn stalks, wheat straw, and switchgrass. Microbes working together are used to first turn cellulose into sugars and then ferment those sugars into cellulosic ethanol fuel. Metagenomics can provide the additional information we need to learn how to adapt microbial fuel production to widespread application.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Agriculture: Soil microbes are known to protect plants from disease and to provide them with nutrients, as when they convert atmospheric nitrogen gas into useable ammonia. Such abilities might someday be manipulated
for improved crop output, but first we need metagenomic analysis to improve our understanding of these complex community activities.
Environment: Much natural and human-made waste is beneficially processed by microbes. Gasoline, for example, leaks from the fuel tanks under many gas stations and enters our groundwater. But our drinking water is made safe by microorganisms, and the same capability could be exploited to clean up larger-scale environmental damage, such as oil spills. Metagenomics could allow us to identify the microbes and the waste treatment processes needed to handle the ever-expanding collection of chemicals...&quot;]]></description>

Thanks, Jon!  I have started a page called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Alcohol&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Alcohol&lt;/a&gt; on the Azimuth Project and have dumped some of the information you provide into this page.  It&#039;s very preliminary - what the Wikipedia people call a &#039;stub&#039;.  If you want to add more, just click &#039;Edit&#039; at the bottom of the page and type stuff in!  Don&#039;t worry too much about getting the format right (unless you&#039;re a perfectionist), we can fix things up.]]></description>
