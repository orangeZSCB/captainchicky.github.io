Flori, thanks for the mention.  David&#039;s objective - &quot;some way that continues to incentivise “intellectual development” whilst stabilizing “environmental development” - is exactly what Keynes&#039;s so called &quot;Widow&#039;s Cruse&quot; model is intended for.

The essential feature of it might be better better termed the &quot;Vigorous youth&#039;s cruse&quot;, because it is about the transition from immature to mature growth, at the end of which a youth is at the peak of their vitality and endurance, not weak and vulnerable like an old widow is perhaps.  I guess Keynes liked the ring of it for some reason, and the Bible story of Elijah giving an old woman an inexhaustible cup of flower and bowl of oil.

What Keynes noticed is that investment needs to stabilize as resource use does, that to &quot;continue to incentivise “intellectual development” the scale of investment needs to stop growing while it still produces healthy returns. Otherwise it would grow to drive the earth to producing no net returns following present practice of using the earnings to add to savings. So a new use for the earnings on investments needed to be found.  

He didn&#039;t go beyond explaining the obvious, that either investment returns don&#039;t materialize, or you don&#039;t add them to the prior accumulation.   I go the step further, and describe various valuable things that might be done with them.  It&#039;s essentially a kind of &quot;peace dividend&quot; for declaring an end of our ever growing war with nature, limiting the expansion of the global pool of investment funds while they still produce earnings, making investment system as a whole sustainable in the bargain.   

You can see my various approaches by searching my site for mentions of Keynes, using [site:synapsee9.com keynes] as the search string.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/11/11/our-future/#comment-2585&quot;&gt;John Baez&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks for reminding me of important homework and making me feel uncomfortable playing &quot;Lovelock&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin%27s_Bulldog#Darwin.27s_bulldog&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;bulldog&lt;/a&gt;&quot;... :)

Alas I currently have neither access to the university network nor much time - so I answer straight out of my weak head:

The CO2 decay diagrams you present below seem to suggest fast negative (stabilizing) feedbacks. And methinks that&#039;s why we got a stable Holocene climate state. &lt;i&gt;Up till yesterday&lt;/i&gt;. I guess the model behind the diagrams does not take into account influence of &lt;i&gt;climate stress&lt;/i&gt; on plants and/or plankton. From the NASA &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/plant-decline.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; I linked:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Global plant productivity that once flourished under warming temperatures and a lengthened growing season is now on the decline, struck by the stress of drought.&lt;/blockquote&gt;One stabilizing feedback gone - &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liebig%27s_law_of_the_minimum&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Liebig&#039;s law of the minimum&lt;/a&gt; kicking in, turning off the feedback. (Some of my pending homework: Get grasp on the role of ocean phytoplankton, check 2010 data with Lovelock&#039;s &#038; Kump&#039;s 1994 simulation of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v369/n6483/abs/369732a0.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&quot;failure&quot; of climate regulation&lt;/a&gt;). Plus, raising temperature means raising soil metabolism, so less humus is formed (instead even some of the 50% of not agrotechnologicly ruined soils might start emitting CO2).

I haven&#039;t yet heard of any fast stabilizing feedback (except that possibly the Sahara could get green again). To the contrary, from the news these days one can readily imagine rapid destruction of vegetation cover (e.g. Pakistan, Russia 2010, Australia 2009).

From Lovelock &#038; Kump:
&lt;blockquote&gt;As the temperature rises to present-day values, algae lose their strong climate influence, but terrestrial ecosystems continue to regulate the climate. But if global mean temperatures rise above about 20 °C, both terrestrial and marine ecosystems are in positive feedback, amplifying any further increase of temperature. As the latter conditions have existed in the past, we propose that other climate-regulating mechanisms must operate in this warm regime.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
What are these other mechanisms?]]></description>

If you believe in the Gaia Hypothesis, why do believe most of the feedbacks will make the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; worse?
