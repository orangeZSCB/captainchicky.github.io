Yes, but this doesn&#039;t imply that the IQs of politicians (or any specific subset of the population) are normally distributed.]]></description>

&#062; &quot;They sell a compiler, but I didn’t have access to it.&quot;

Nathan, The name &quot;compiler&quot; is there for historical reasons, but really it is just a way of packaging things up with a runtime version of the interpreter, so you can give executables to people (along with the required dlls). So it does not really improve execution speed that much.

Automatically generating optimized C code that is independent on the interpreter is possible using the Embedded MATLAB Coder (people in the aerospace and automotive industries might be more familiar with it). Using that, i have obtained a 200-fold performance improvement (for an extended kalman filter) with respect to interpreted MATLAB. So your 100-fold improvement is not really surprising to me.

It is also possible to run MATLAB on the GPU, using the parallel computing toolbox, but i haven&#039;t tried that yet.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s one of the articles referenced by the Wiki peak coal page:
http://www.energywatchgroup.org/fileadmin/global/pdf/EWG_Report_Coal_10-07-2007ms.pdf

Their guess for Chinese peak coal is 2015; the EIA guess is 2030 or beyond. Apparently they&#039;ve got some big coal mine fires which they can&#039;t put out, which account for about 5% of their reserves. There&#039;s a paper referenced on this topic, which appears to be unpublished work by one of the authors.

Chinese reserves are probably a huge state secret, probably CIA might have a better guess, but they might not be too forthcoming, either.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s very little out there on total Chinese production, but here&#039;s a chart on exports:
http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/country/img/charts/CH_coal_import_export_large.png

Of course, this could reflect that China has gone from being a net exporter of crude oil to a net importer. The curve ends in 2007, before the economic collapse, so that doesn&#039;t enter in to these figures. It might be simply that the Chinese are diverting their coal to a coal-to-liquids plant, to produce oil, hydrocarbons, and asphalt. I&#039;ll keep looking around...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well, I mis-spoke about peak coal. TheOilDrum.com has, in this 2007 piece, peak coal occurring in a plateau from about 2015 to 2040, then tailing off: http://www.theoildrum.com/node/2396

In this study, published this year, 2010, peak coal, including Chinese production, is forecast to occur between 2015 and 2033:
http://www.theoildrum.com/node/6782#more

And finally, in this paper, published in 2009 in a journal named Fuel, the peak production of coal is forecast to occur somewhere between 2010 and 2048, with their best guess for peak production year being, roughly, 2036:
http://www.theoildrum.com/node/5256

So it look like I was optimistic by about 40 years or so...]]></description>

I&#039;m surprised that you say most predictions say this about coal.  I&#039;ve seen a lot of different predictions about peak oil &#8212; there&#039;s an  &lt;a href=&quot;http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2010/11/chart-day-peak-oil&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;interesting new article by Kevin Drum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Mother Jones&lt;/i&gt; magazine, for example.  But I always thought the &lt;i&gt;problem&lt;/i&gt;, as far as global warming goes, is that there&#039;s a lot more coal.

The Wikipedia article &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_coal&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Peak coal&lt;/a&gt; is not very informative.  For example: a figure for peak coal production in China, without any source or attribution.]]></description>

I guess you know that currently available varieties of hemp, including common wild weed, produce far more usable fiber per hectare than any other plant, while simultaneously producing more edible protein and oil than any crop it would replace. Even common wild weed outperforms Dyson&#039;s hypothetical magic forests by an order of magnitude more CO2 removal.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think that unless we find a source of energy equally as energy-dense as crude oil, before depletion seriously sets in, we&#039;ll be in for a worldwide economic collapse. US agriculture is heavily dependent on fossil fuels to provide the food surplus which feeds the underdeveloped and developing nations whose population is booming, far past their carrying capacity even now. When oil scarcity hits the US, not only will it drive US food prices higher, it&#039;ll become prohibitively expensive to ship food overseas, thus the developing and underdeveloped countries will be forced to fall back on what they can produce on their own. For underdeveloped countries in Africa, this will result in famine and mass starvation and political instability; for developing countries like China, the consequences will be hard to predict, but they may suffer economic depression and political instability as well. The end result of these events may be a drastic downward shift in population, in the underdeveloped world, and in the developing world, a slowing-down of economic development. 

It should also be considered that crude oil is also a feedstock for plastics, pharmaceutical drugs, and agricultural chemicals among other items, and is not just a source of energy. There&#039;ll be a considerable amount of competition amongst there uses, unless an alternate, renewable feedstock, such as hemp, is developed.]]></description>
