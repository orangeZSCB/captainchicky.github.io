It seems to accord with the &quot;per captia&quot; column in &lt;a href=&quot;http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=phNtm3LmDZEP4Ou7jpeRQbA&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt; (referenced by this different newspaper &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/datablog/2009/sep/02/carbon-emissions-per-person-capita&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). There are some odd numbers (Virgin Islands (US) has almost 30 times more emissions per capita than Virgin Islands (Britsh)). I&#039;m tempted to think that it&#039;s a case of having a very small &quot;permanent population&quot; but a large number of highly-consuming tourist visitors &lt;em&gt;relative to size of the population&lt;/em&gt; that causes them to have very, very large &quot;per capita&quot; emissions. Of couse, they&#039;re getting money from those visitors so they do derive great benefit, but is it illuminating to assign &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; that use to their country rather than the tourists country?]]></description>

In case it&#039;s of interest:

I&#039;ve got the magazine from the UK&#039;s Mail on Sunday newspaper in front of me (there was a &quot;free&quot; CD offer, don&#039;t judge me...) It&#039;s got a data graphic of &quot;Carbon emissions&quot; (which I presume means carbon dioxide, methane, ...) for some unspecified timeperiod (which unfortunately isn&#039;t online) with unspecified accounting (eg, who counts for importing carbon intensive goods). According to that graphic the largest &lt;em&gt;per capita&lt;/em&gt; carbon emitter is Gibraltar, followed by the &quot;Virgin Islands, US&quot; and then probably Qatar, although lots of Middle Eastern countries have per capita emissions of about the same size. The other two blobs about that size are &quot;Trinidad and Tobago&quot; and &quot;Former Netherlands Antilles&quot;.

This seems to be saying that per-capita stats are dominated by tiny population countries, I don&#039;t have any real idea why.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;By the way: how come I can afford to create a link to the original article, while the BBC and other mass media cannot? Is it really so bloody difficult? Isn’t it just basic good journalism?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/the-lay-scientist/2010/sep/24/1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;This splendid explanation piece of science journalism&lt;/a&gt; by Martin Robbins reveals all:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is a news website article about a scientific paper&lt;/b&gt;

[...]

In this paragraph I will state in which journal the research will be published. I won&#039;t provide a link because either a) the concept of adding links to web pages is alien to the editors, b) I can&#039;t be bothered, or c) the journal inexplicably set the embargo on the press release to expire before the paper was actually published.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
(Extra-ordinarily, many if not most of the &quot;reader comments&quot; are worth reading.)

He followed up with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/the-lay-scientist/2010/sep/28/science-journalism-spoof&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&quot;Why I spoofed science journalism, and how to fix it&quot;&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>

A guess, based on comments from other science bloggers: journals a have some sort of weird deal going on with the media, where the press release happens, and popular articles are written, well before the original article appears.

For what it&#039;s worth, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.epa.gov/otaq/climate/420r06003summary.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;US Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/a&gt; says US transportation produced 27% of all US greenhouse gases in 2003, and 1.87 gigatons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent.  This would contain about 0.5 gigatons of carbon if it were all CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, but &#039;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent&#039; means they&#039;re also including other greenhouse gases.

We need to put a lot of these figures on the Azimuth Project in a well-organized way.  Or at least links to lots of data.  Right now this information is spread all over the landscape.  Of course I prefer world figures, but there&#039;s also lots of data for individual countries.]]></description>

Electricity production (per citizen) and heating?

For the reference, that should be: 
http://carbon.trx.com/TRX_CO2_Emissions_Documentation_v1.4.pdf

I estimated the weight of carbon produced, not the weight of CO2, the difference is 32g/mole, so if you burn carbon with 100% efficiency, you get a weight increase from 12g/mole to 44g/mole. A friend&#039;s rule of thumb estimates for automobile emissions is that an automobile generates its weight in carbon per year, thus about 3.7 times its weight in CO2.... so my first WAG was messed up. Take 2500 pounds x 3.7 and that equals about 9250 pounds. I just doubled the auto emissions, setting the amount for all other uses equal to the amount of auto emissions.... That&#039;s a real WAG, because there are so many factors to control for, including how far back you trace the usage of fuel, i.e. To mine the ore with pick and shovel to put in a smelter to make steel, to make tools from the steel, to use the tools to make other tools and machines to generate electricity by burning natural gas or coal or fuel oil or uranium, and to transmit the electricity over a network made up of structures which were made from refined ore... And so on.

Eventually you have to make a lot of assumptions, and even the best of estimates are WAGs when you get down to it. My WAG, if done correctly, is 2 x 9235 pounds per capita per annum, which comes out to about 9.235 tons, which is still way below the Terrapass figures - but they use a lot more sophisticated analysis than I do.]]></description>
