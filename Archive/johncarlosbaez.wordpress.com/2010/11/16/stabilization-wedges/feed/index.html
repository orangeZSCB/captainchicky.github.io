					<description><![CDATA[Just mostly idle curiosity perhaps, but who in particular are the absolute devotees of &quot;growth&quot;, and how is such growth defined?  I consider myself a reasonably astute member of civilized, even of urban humanity, however, not only me, but the majority of my acquaintances are frankly puzzled by the preoccupation toward &quot;growing&quot; apparently everything from the expanse of domiciles and dwellings to the amount one can pile on a plate at restaurants and buffets. 

My offhand impression of Scandinavian countries, among others, is that they are fairly stable in size of everything and seem to maintain a working equilibrium between intake and dissipation in most things that matter. 

Anything to the contrary seems to me an obsessive-compulsive disorder perhaps similar to the mass &quot;tarantella&quot; problems in 17th century southern Italy.   I hear echoes of Vance Packard from bygone years pointing out how fish fins on automobiles (or &quot;spoilers&quot;, nowadays) are exclusively the outcome of waking hypnotic suggestion from both commercial and intellectual advertising.  Might we all hope that the &quot;Marlboro-man&quot; of incessant growth will someday gasp his last in the same manner as his nicotinic brother?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was referencing T.S. Kuhn recently and noticed he sort of said &quot;don&#039;t bother&quot;, they&#039;re never going to take to new ideas anyway...  I have hopes of teaching people skills of observation, but still, it says we&#039;re in a worse jam than we thought (to add to all the long overdue homework assignments we&#039;d been ignoring...).   

I&#039;ve recently found some good response from institutional investor groups, those realizing there&#039;s a definite problem here, but am still rebuffed by economists.  Keynes even pointed out that different parts of an economic system can&#039;t wander off by themselves, it spoils the fun...   Maybe the line is between people willing to entertain the possibility we might live in a physical world where things behave by themselves and we better watch, vs. those that can&#039;t stand that idea...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The irony I see is that when someone point out the importance of looking at the wall we&#039;re running into, others tend to see the solution as finding ways to keep running toward it ever faster,... Isn&#039;t that how we&#039;re all treating the problem of natural limits, seeing the solution to resource constraint as inventing ways to consume them faster??

To me that&#039;s the problem with the &quot;wedges&quot; models, a real conceptual error from the start.  They draw the problem as a somewhat accountable triangle to integrate, rather than an escalating process that needs to continue somehow.  

So... I corrected my dollarshadow page, with the energy figures seeming to be validated in this exchange, and the PV farm area figures corrected by a factor of 20.3.   That means to generate the economy&#039;s energy with PV (a 100% &quot;wedge&quot; at present growth rates) we&#039;d need to cover the whole earth in 259 years instead of 111, but still presents kind of a problem.   I can&#039;t retrace all my steps, but that estimate of the time we have before hitting &quot;the wall&quot; is actually what I was always estimating before, from rough methods, until I recently laid out the calculation in a way people could check...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/11/16/stabilization-wedges/#comment-3131&quot;&gt;Willis Eschenbach&lt;/a&gt;.

Willis wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

There is no agreement on the proper settings for the Berne model. Different modelers pick different numbers and get different answers. Different numbers were used in the SAR, TAR, and FAR reports. Perhaps you could tell us which numbers were right, and which were wrong, and why …

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Alas, I&#039;m just trying to learn this stuff.  I find that the fastest way is to talk about it in public, so people can chip in with extra information, and do their best to find mistakes in what I write.

So thanks!  I can&#039;t say anything interesting about your comments yet, but clearly they mean that I need to learn more about the carbon cycle, and the various models people use for it.  

You&#039;re claiming that there&#039;s so much uncertainty that we can&#039;t use these models to aid us in decision-making.  Other people say otherwise.  I&#039;ll only be able to have an interesting opinion on this question after I learn more.  

&lt;blockquote&gt;

Since whoever wrote that clearly does not understand the intricacies of the magic of compounding interest and never heard of the “rule of 70″, and since a carbon model is nothing but a model of compound (negative) interest, I knew I had left science and was wandering among climate scientists. 

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I think that&#039;s unfair, both to climate scientists as a whole, most of whom don&#039;t deserve this sort of abuse, and also to Pacala and Socolow.  This remark of theirs:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

In our BAU emissions scenario, carbon emissions grow 1.5%/y and double in 50 years. If, as well, the economy were to grow at 3%/y, then, in 50 years, the economy would quadruple, and its carbon intensity would fall to half its original value. 

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

may lead you to think they&#039;re confused.  But since Socolow is a professor of mechanical engineering at Princeton, and Pacala did work on mathematical biology as a grad student at Stanford before going on to direct the Princeton Environmental Institute, I suspect that in fact at least one of them understands compound interest.

And indeed, if the economy grows at 1.5% for 50 years, it will grow by a factor of about 2.105.  If it grows at 3% for 50 years, it will grow by a factor of about 4.38.  I don&#039;t think it&#039;s bad, in the context at hand, to say &quot;double&quot; and &quot;quadruple&quot;.  It&#039;s not as if the conclusions would be affected by the extra decimals!

To me, the important part of Pacala and Socolow&#039;s paper is their list of gigaton-carbon-per-year &quot;wedges&quot;, which takes the overall issue of carbon emissions and breaks it into pieces that are easier to grasp and argue about.]]></description>

I quite agree Willis that &quot;The gospel truth about carbon is that so far, we don’t have enough knowledge to properly set the dials&quot;.  One factor most people don&#039;t discuss is the &quot;dirty&quot; truth that carbon fuels are going to continue to be the cheapest source of energy, and since all the mitigation strategies are predicated on only marginal growth restraint, the proposed technologies probably won&#039;t work economically.

As to the economy x4 in 50 years and the carbon intensity (per $) 1/2 I think that&#039;s exactly the BAU rates.
   
This shows the IEA historic data for GDP, energy and energy efficiency proportioned to their growth rates along with the ratios for their growth rates.  With notes from a talk I gave on it at fyi:

A better phrasing would have been &quot;I don’t see why a rounding up introducing an inaccuracy of 3.5 years to presumably get a round figure&quot;. I also can&#039;t find any problem, except another 3.5ish year round up for the 3 percent quadrupling time, with any of the rest of that quote. (I can understand this is a very, very simplified model which one might object to, but you seem to be suggesting something a numerical error.)]]></description>

I&#039;m trying to understand what you mean by

&lt;blockquote&gt;

Since whoever wrote that clearly does not understand the intricacies of the magic of compounding interest and never heard of the “rule of 70″,

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So the heuristic gives a doubling time of 46 years, the actual doubling time is about 46.56 years. However, I don&#039;t see why inaccuracy of 3.5 years to presumably get a round figure for a written repot implies problems with their science. Could you expand on what is actually incorrect about what they&#039;re saying?]]></description>
