					<description><![CDATA[Most of Singapore is less than 15 meters above sea level.  Global change will eventually put it underwater.  Maybe they will call in a few experts from the Netherlands.  They will be able to use the electricity from the nuclear plants to keep the pumps going.  They may have to put a lot of people in sampans anyway.  The assumptions are that the amount of energy used will remain at current levels.  That is probably not going to happen.  So it might just get to be NOAH time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It is good that energy is an important topic for policymakers in Singapore.

On the other hand it is very easy to perform a speech/lecture as you would like to have (e.g. professional, informed, and devoid of rhetoric) if you are in total power.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Indeed, as John says, a very professional presentation, calm, well-balanced and devoid of rhetoric. Most of Singapore&#039;s power is generated from LNG, for which a new terminal and distribution centre is being built. Pilot sites of industry and residential premises will take part in advanced &quot;smart&quot; energy management systems. Most strikingly to me, he considered nuclear power as an option that Singapore cannot discount. An impressive opening speech.]]></description>

What’s “ta”?

He pointed out that America is beginning to build more nuclear plants, and that Angela Merkel, despite great pressure from the Greens, had put off the closure of such plants in Germany. He said that more plants would eventually be built in Germany, even though it’s “unspeakable” now. 

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
There was quite a debate in the Bundestag about this, but it was not about sustainability: The nuclear power plants are &lt;i&gt;money printing machines&lt;/i&gt; for ta, so the owners created considerable pressure to let them operate a decade longer than planned. There is no discussion at all whether nuclear power plants should play any role in the future energy supply mix. The opposition (including the Greens) blamed Merkel for giving in without getting an adequate compensation.

(P.S.: Merk&lt;b&gt;e&lt;/b&gt;l).]]></description>
