					<description><![CDATA[Economics is dynamic. All my ways of trying to understand it are static, like EROEI. So I often wonder whether I really understand. We get this in the EROEI discussion. So what happens to the money the company pays to the janitor (or the CEO). They spend it, and there is energy embodied in the stuff they receive. And the people receiving the money spend it and ...

This seems to have something to do with Liebig&#039;s Law. The thing that is in short supply is what counts. For 200+ years that thing has been skilled labour. Now, maybe temporarily, it is oil. So that suggests that for our infinite regression on the janitor&#039;s salary, each step has some embodied oil. And the sum of all those bits of embodied oil limits how much value you can get out of the dollar. Well this conveniently forgets that there is some time delay between receiving and spending money: the velocity of money.

So let&#039;s take a case relevant to saving the world: our carbon tax (whether it is done with a market or not). Proponents of this mostly say that it should be revenue neutral. All the money raised is returned to the public in some wonderfully fair way. Let&#039;s assume we have a closed system: Not much point if we just move the carbon emissions to another country. So the public buy energy (directly or indirectly) and part of the price is carbon tax. Then they get that back and they buy more stuff with embodied energy. Then they get that tax back. Well its doubtful if you can buy anything that doesn&#039;t have embodied energy, but only a proportion is carbon intensive. So how does this cycle play out? Are the infinities relevant or can we normalize or zenoize them?]]></description>

That&#039;s a very pessimistic attitude &#8212; one I don&#039;t share at all!  You could start here:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;
This article reviews recent literature on drought of the last millennium, followed by an update on global aridity changes from 1950 to 2008. Projected future aridity is presented based on recent studies and our analysis of model simulations. Dry periods lasting for years to decades have occurred many times during the last millennium over, for example, North America, West Africa, and East Asia. These droughts were likely triggered by anomalous tropical sea surface temperatures (SSTs), with La Niña-like SST anomalies leading to drought in North America, and El-Niño-like SSTs causing drought in East China. Over Africa, the southward shift of the warmest SSTs in the Atlantic and warming in the Indian Ocean are responsible for the recent Sahel droughts. Local feedbacks may enhance and prolong drought. Global aridity has increased substantially since the 1970s due to recent drying over Africa, southern Europe, East and South Asia, and eastern Australia. Although El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), tropical Atlantic SSTs, and Asian monsoons have played a large role in the recent drying, recent warming has increased atmospheric moisture demand and likely altered atmospheric circulation patterns, both contributing to the drying. Climate models project increased aridity in the 21st century over most of Africa, southern Europe and the Middle East, most of the Americas, Australia, and Southeast Asia. Regions like the United States have avoided prolonged droughts during the last 50 years due to natural climate variations, but might see persistent droughts in the next 20–50 years. Future efforts to predict drought will depend on models&#039; ability to predict tropical SSTs.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Read some of the references.  Build up a picture of what scientists think about these issues.  Then write a blog article about it, telling us what you&#039;ve found, and raising any questions you think need to be raised.  I&#039;ll post it here.  Then people will drift along and give you more information.  

Lather, rinse and repeat &#8212; this is my favorite way of learning stuff: &quot;learning by explaining&quot;. 

I really urge you to do this!]]></description>

I guess the key thing is that warm+dry is just one of many claims that float around, and there is little chance of finding out which serious researchers believe it. I gather the new Congress will be investigating this stuff from a negative position. Maybe there needs to be some discussion aimed at figuring out what is universally believed and able to be argued in a reasonably consistent way before lots of people start saying contradictory things in front of House investigations. Beyond that, consideration should be given to the best achievable result rather than the best result. The Right wants more Nuclear Power for various security reasons. The elections in America and Australia have been influenced by resistance to rising energy costs. It is a fantasy to think we can slug voters with reduced and expensive energy while Peak Oil is killing the economy. The people who claim to be extremely worried about AGW need to give up their opposition to Nuclear Power ASAP. However you evaluate the total cost, Nuclear Power has the lowest marginal cost after the plant has been built, and so if you cough up the money now (for whatever reason) then it will definitely displace burning fossil fuel after that.]]></description>

While it was argued that the EROEI metric might not be useful because coal has a high EROEI, while it is actually a &quot;bad&quot; choice, I feel that, in fact, this is precisely why the EROEI might indeed be useful (along with other metrics in our decision making).  The reason why coal will continue to be attractive to many despite the environmental problems its use causes is EXACTLY because, as the EROEI indicates, there is a high return on energy investment, as compared to many more environmentally attractive alternatives that have a smaller payoff (as measured by the EROEI).  The *scale* of investment in replacing one form of energy with another is a difficult, but essential component in our decision making.]]></description>

Ditto. I&#039;d also add that though EROEI is still somewhat useful, that what&#039;s most important are the myriad uses of oil beyond just fuel (ie chemicals, plastics, etc.)

Btw I&#039;m also Quebecois, and a long-time reader of TOD. I don&#039;t mean to be too off topic, but I&#039;m very interested in Quebec&#039;s post peak oil future. Aside from government and HydroQ sources, do you know of any sources of info or research on Quebec&#039;s energy future? I&#039;m particularly interested in the role Quebec could play in Northeastern North America in the coming decades.]]></description>

I&#039;ll need to do a &lt;i&gt;This Week&#039;s Finds&lt;/i&gt; on &quot;peak oil&quot;.  I&#039;m slightly dreading it, because it&#039;s a controversial issue, so it&#039;s hard to find facts that everyone agrees on (except perhaps that there&#039;s a finite amount of oil inside the Earth).  But it&#039;s also fascinating and important.

Hemp, eh?  I wish I could lure you into contributing some know-how to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/HomePage&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Azimuth Project&lt;/a&gt;.  We need it!

On a somewhat different note, it seems the Californians have voted down the measure to legalize marijuana.  But they also voted down a fiendish proposition that would have blocked implementation of a law requiring our state to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by roughly &lt;a href=&quot;http://gov.ca.gov/index.php?/press-release/4111/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;20 percent by 2020, and more later&lt;/a&gt;.  It&#039;s been said this may be the first time a population has voted on the issue of climate change.   I&#039;m glad they voted smart, despite &lt;a href=&quot;http://environment.about.com/b/2010/10/28/schwarzenegger-battles-proposition-23-blasts-oil-companies-for-self-serving-greed.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;oil money pouring in from Texas companies&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;img src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/emoticons/thumbsup.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;  ]]></description>

I&#8217;m glad they voted smart, despite <a href="http://environment.about.com/b/2010/10/28/schwarzenegger-battles-proposition-23-blasts-oil-companies-for-self-serving-greed.htm" rel="nofollow">oil money pouring in from Texas companies</a>. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/emoticons/thumbsup.gif" alt="" />  </p>

					<description><![CDATA[People tend to forget that petroleum is a feedstock for plastics, pharmaceuticals, and the majority of the products made by the chemical industry, and is a source of industrial solvents, as well. It is not solely used as a fuel. If we get into a petroleum crunch, that means, that unless we can find suitable replacements for this feedstock, the prices on a lot of other goods will increase sharply too.

It&#039;s another reason to repeal the prohibition on hemp, since hemp oil can replace petroleum as a feedstock for plastics as can hemp fiber, amongst a whole galaxy of uses.]]></description>
