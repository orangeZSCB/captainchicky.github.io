Indeed right now the price would be infinite, since there&#039;s no way we could buy this much olivine until production got ramped up.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

(of the price of gigatonnes of olivine)

I would say it is the fact that there are mountains of olivine, or as they are sometimes called, mountains of dunite, harzburgite (partly olivine), peridotite, and probably some others I haven&#039;t learned.

The earth&#039;s mantle is made of these things, and sticks through the crust in many places. Plants don&#039;t grow on these outcroppings, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alpinenz.com/images/tn/Richards-big.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is a nice illustration of the join with adjacent plant-supporting terrain, from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alpinenz.com/Red-Hills.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.alpinenz.com/Red-Hills.html&lt;/a&gt;.

If a coal burner put a particular mole of CO2 into the atmosphere, ~400 primary kJ were yielded. I figure olivine pulverization to 25 microns will require another 40 primary kJ, and lifting this powder 5 km into the atmosphere, 10 kJ, for a total of one-eighth of the long-ago energy that now must be spent to clean up after it.

My idea is to let the wind spread out these slowly settling particles. Lifting them higher would help, but 5 km is about as far as a stream launched from the ground can climb without being initially supersonic. I foresee this large air-cleaning job being done from large central plants, built on olivine terrain, that won&#039;t do anything else; maybe they&#039;ll be able to have tall launch towers so as to get more height without exposing the stream to air drag at first.

Yes, there&#039;s plenty of solar power streaming down on us &#8212; but there is the enormous challenge of harnessing it &lt;i&gt;soon enough&lt;/i&gt; to prevent devastating global warming. 

For an optimistic plan, see:

For a withering critique, see:

The author of the article you cite admits that we&#039;ll need to work wonders:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Innovations in nanotechnology and
other advances in materials science
would make it possible to transform our
vision of plentiful, low-cost energy into a
reality. By developing new technologies,
marshaling the excellent resources of
organizations like the Materials Research
Society, and developing the talents of a
new generation of scientists and engineers,
I believe that we can solve even
our most critical energy problems.

Our job &#8212; yes, us, here! &#8212; is to figure out what we can actually do.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Giampero - I&#039;m very glad you&#039;ve been doing some calculations, and I want to return to discussing this subject, especially now that I&#039;ve found some &quot;professional&quot; work on this subject which we should analyze!  I will write about that in a new post.

For now, just one pathetically tiny comment.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/10/05/power-density/#comment-1791&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Back here&lt;/a&gt; you write:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

So, according to this 2008 article 100 new MW of CSP (Concentrating Solar Power) were installed in 2007.

Taking into account that “capacity is expected to double every 16 months over the next five years”, that would amount to roughly 6000 new MW of CSP in 5 years, which means a rate of 1200 new MW a year. Better but still a far cry from the 70000 MW / year required to have 2TW of CSP in 25 years (it will take more than a 1K years at this rate).

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I agree that it looks hopeless.

But I must note that you are assuming the amount of new concentrated solar power (=CSP) installed per year levels off in 2012 at the rate of 6000 MW/year.  Why can&#039;t it keep growing?  

Just for fun, let us make the very optimistic assumption that new CSP keeps doubling every 16 months, starting in 2007.   What will we see 25 years later?  

25 &#215; 12/16 = 18.75 so it will have doubled 18.75 times by then.  

2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;18.75&lt;/sup&gt; is about 440,000, so it will grow by this factor.

In other words, starting from 100 megawatts/year of new concentrated solar power in 2007, we&#039;ll be getting 44,000,000 megawatts/year of new CSP 25 years later.  Or in other words, 44 terawatts/year!  

That would be great: it would come late, but come in large amounts.

However, this calculation assumes a continued exponential growth without any reason to think that is practical.

(Someone should also check my math; it&#039;s easy to make enormous, embarrassing mistakes.)

I have seen &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.world-nuclear.org/outlook/clean_energy_need.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;another estimate&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Nuclear+power&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;some call optimistic&lt;/a&gt;, saying that total wind and solar electrical power generation might be around 1 terawatt by 2030 and 5 terawatts by 2100.    That&#039;s vastly worse.

My plan is to figure out &lt;i&gt;realistic&lt;/i&gt; values of these numbers, with the help of everyone here.  For these more realistic calculations I will need to do something much more intelligent than extrapolate an exponential function.  &lt;img src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/emoticons/tongue2.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;  All the factors you mention will become important.]]></description>

<p>I agree that it looks hopeless.</p>
<p>But I must note that you are assuming the amount of new concentrated solar power (=CSP) installed per year levels off in 2012 at the rate of 6000 MW/year.  Why can&#8217;t it keep growing?  </p>
<p>Just for fun, let us make the very optimistic assumption that new CSP keeps doubling every 16 months, starting in 2007.   What will we see 25 years later?  </p>
<p>25 &times; 12/16 = 18.75 so it will have doubled 18.75 times by then.  </p>
<p>2<sup></sup><sup>18.75</sup> is about 440,000, so it will grow by this factor.</p>
<p>In other words, starting from 100 megawatts/year of new concentrated solar power in 2007, we&#8217;ll be getting 44,000,000 megawatts/year of new CSP 25 years later.  Or in other words, 44 terawatts/year!  </p>
<p>That would be great: it would come late, but come in large amounts.</p>
<p>However, this calculation assumes a continued exponential growth without any reason to think that is practical.</p>
<p>(Someone should also check my math; it&#8217;s easy to make enormous, embarrassing mistakes.)</p>
<p>I have seen <a href="http://www.world-nuclear.org/outlook/clean_energy_need.html" rel="nofollow">another estimate</a>, which <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Nuclear+power" rel="nofollow">some call optimistic</a>, saying that total wind and solar electrical power generation might be around 1 terawatt by 2030 and 5 terawatts by 2100.    That&#8217;s vastly worse.</p>
<p>My plan is to figure out <i>realistic</i> values of these numbers, with the help of everyone here.  For these more realistic calculations I will need to do something much more intelligent than extrapolate an exponential function.  <img src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/emoticons/tongue2.gif" alt="" />  All the factors you mention will become important.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s an interesting article from a few years ago that has a map showing the scale of what 60,000 square kilometers of solar power looks like:

This would provide ~20TW of electricity (of course, the challenges of distributing this around the world are not minor either...)]]></description>

Forget algae, grow bamboo instead, it&#039;s useful in very many ways and it grows faster than kudzu (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboo )]]></description>
