By the way, someone pointed out that we don&#039;t need

$latex [H,F] = \{S,F\} = 0$

for all functions $latex F$. To derive the few results I describe, it&#039;s enough to have 

$latex [H,S] = \{S,H\} = 0$

It seems the &#214;ttinger assumes the stronger formulation but only uses the weaker one---see the text before equation (1.22) in his book &lt;i&gt;Beyond Equilibrium Thermodynamics&lt;/i&gt;.

I&#039;m afraid I don&#039;t remember who pointed out this fact, and I can&#039;t find the place on this blog where they did it!  But I think it&#039;s important.]]></description>

I would like to give a very simple example, but the examples I&#039;ve seen are too complicated for me to summarize here.  If you&#039;re a clever guy you can use sneaky tricks to find an online copy of this book:

&#8226; Hans Christian &#214;ttinger, &lt;i&gt;Beyond Equilibrium Thermodynamics&lt;/i&gt;, Wiley, 2005.

and that&#039;s one way to see a bunch of examples.  This book is also good:

Re: enlarging the images

Install Userscripts for Konqueror
http://kde-apps.org/content/show.php?content=51482
then write a script that iterates over the images in the page served from l.wordpress.com and add or change the &#039;s&#039; parameter.  That will cause them to reload larger.

(If you don&#039;t know JavaScript, let me know and I&#039;ll write it for you.)]]></description>

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Polarization says that two symmetric bilinear forms $latex B$, $latex B&#039;$ with

$latex B(v,v) = B&#039;(v,v)$

for all $latex v$ also have

$latex B(v,w) = B&#039;(v,w)$

for all $latex v, w$.  The proof is easy: there&#039;s an explicit formula for $latex B(v,w)$ in terms of its &#039;diagonal&#039; entries:

$latex 2B(v,w) = B(v+w,v+w)-B(v,v)-B(w,w)$

as long as we&#039;re working over a field that allows division by 2.  

The 2nd partial derivatives 

$latex \partial_i \partial_j f $

of any smooth function define a symmetric bilinear form, and so does the quantity

$latex \mathrm{Re} \langle (X_i - \langle X_i \rangle)\,(X_j - \langle X_j \rangle) \rangle $

So I think everything is fine --- Eric and I went over it pretty carefully, here on the blog.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Perhaps this can be improved!?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I&#039;m sorry, I don&#039;t know how.  This problem would presumably arise on any Wordpress math blog, e.g. Terry Tao&#039;s blog or the Secret Blogging Seminar, which are both quite popular.  So, maybe they know a solution.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.support.wordpress.com/latex/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wordpress blogs produce LaTeX images as png files&lt;/a&gt;.  png files are rescalable, so presumably a sufficiently smart browser could do it, e.g. with a plugin.  I can create pngs in different sizes from this end:

$latex \int x dx &#038;s=4$

should be a lot bigger than

$latex \int x dx &#038;s=-4$

But I don&#039;t see anything at my end that helps you rescale the math symbols at your end.

By the way, to write math equations on a Wordpress blog, you just put the word &#039;latex&#039; right after the first dollar sign:

&#036;latex \sqrt{3} &#036;

produes

$latex \sqrt{3} $

Double dollars don&#039;t work here.  So, it&#039;s easy for you to write math on this blog, but maybe not so easy for you read it.  

I chose to move to this blog instead of a blog with technology more like that of the n-Category Cafe because many mathematicians with old browsers were reluctant to obtain the math fonts necessary to view the posts there, and that limited the readership.  I thought this problem would be even worse at Azimuth, since many of the readers aren&#039;t mathematicians. ]]></description>

John Baez says: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
So, in quantum statistical mechanics we have

$latex \frac{\partial^2}{\partial \lambda^i \partial \lambda^j} \ln Z =  \mathrm{Re}\,\langle \, (X_i -\langle X_i\rangle)\,(X_j -\langle X_j\rangle) \,\rangle$ 

This should be in a textbook somewhere! Does anyone out there know where it can be found?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Formulas for quantum covariances can be found in many textbooks on nonequilibrium statistical physics. 
See e.g., Section 5.3 and 6.3 of
http://de.arxiv.org/pdf/0810.1019v1, where things are phrased as conventionally in terms of the Kubo inner product.

I haven&#039;t seen though the formula with the real part, so maybe your application of polarization is not justified? 

By the way, I am using a large font to display the text in my konqueror browser, and am dismayed that the formulas don&#039;t scale with the remaining text. The indices are almost unreadablefor me. Perhaps this can be improved!?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/10/29/information-geometry-part-4/#comment-2289&quot;&gt;phorgyphynance&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Great!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cool :)

&lt;blockquote&gt;Thanks for not believing my claim about the second derivative of $latex \ln Z$ until you checked it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Well, everything seemed very clean and pretty, i.e. it &quot;felt right&quot;, until you threw in the $latex \text{Re}$. For a second it seemed like you were saying, &quot;Well, what I wanted was symmetric, but I got something unsymmetric, so let&#039;s just symmetrize it.&quot; Symmetrizing things willy nilly doesn&#039;t &quot;feel right&quot; so I was happy to see it come out once you recognize the diagonal elements can be associated with a norm.

I have some real practical applications of this in mind if things work out the way I hope, so I&#039;m glad to be back on board and looking forward to the rest of the ride :)]]></description>
