					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/10/02/recommended-reading/#comment-9771&quot;&gt;Thomas&lt;/a&gt;.

That second link has some fascinating details on the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, or PETM:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Given the degree of acidification of the ocean, Zachos and his colleagues have estimated that an initial burst of around three trillion metric tons of carbon flooded the atmosphere, then another trillion and a half leaked out more gradually. The total of 4.5 trillion tons is close to the total carbon now estimated to be locked up in fossil fuel deposits; the initial burst corresponds to about three centuries&#039; worth of human-caused emissions at the current rate. Though the data aren&#039;t conclusive, most scientists assume the PETM release was slower, taking thousands of years.

However fast the carbon was released, it would have taken far longer for geologic processes to remove it. As the carbonates on the seafloor dissolved, counteracting the acidification, the ocean was able to absorb more CO2, and within a few centuries or millennia of the sudden release, the atmospheric CO2 peak had passed. Meanwhile CO2 was also dissolving into rain droplets, which leached calcium from rocks on land and washed it to the sea, where it combined with carbonate ions to make more calcium carbonate. The process, called weathering, happens all the time, but it happened faster during the PETM, because the climate was hotter and the rain more acidic. Gradually the rain scrubbed the added CO2 from the atmosphere, and eventually it wound up in limestone at the bottom of the sea. The climate slowly returned to its previous state. &quot;It&#039;s just like with fossil fuels today,&quot; Zachos says. &quot;We&#039;re taking what took millions of years to accumulate and releasing it in a geologic instant. Eventually the system will stick it back into rock, but that will take hundreds of thousands of years.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As they note, this holds lots of lessons for us:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Koch and Zachos concluded from their data that the PETM had lifted the annual average temperature in the Bighorn Basin by around nine degrees Fahrenheit. That&#039;s more than the warming there since the last ice age. It&#039;s also a bit more than what climate models predict there for the 21st century—but not more than what they forecast for the centuries to come if humans keep burning fossil fuels. Models also predict severe disruptions in the world&#039;s rainfall patterns, even in this century, especially in subtropical regions like the American Southwest. But how to test the models? &quot;You can&#039;t wait 100 or 200 years to see what happened,&quot; says Swedish geologist Birger Schmitz, who has spent a decade studying PETM rocks in the Spanish Pyrenees. &quot;That&#039;s what makes the PETM story so interesting. You have the end result. You can see what did happen.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In fact an increase of 9 degrees Fahrenheit (or 5 &#176;C) or more is quite possible by the end of this century, according to various models.  ]]></description>
