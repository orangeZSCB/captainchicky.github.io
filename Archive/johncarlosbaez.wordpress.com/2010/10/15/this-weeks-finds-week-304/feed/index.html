					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/10/15/this-weeks-finds-week-304/#comment-2268&quot;&gt;John Baez&lt;/a&gt;.

That paper is relevant to my research on uncertainty and economic policy.  &quot;Deep uncertainty&quot; is something that I think about.  There are various approaches to it.

One is &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dempster%E2%80%93Shafer_theory&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Dempster-Shafer theory&lt;/a&gt;.  This alternate probability calculus allows you to assign probabilities to things, but also to quantify some amount of &quot;I don&#039;t know what the probability is&quot;, and to propagate this &quot;don&#039;t know&quot; factor through your calculations.  It&#039;s a little odd.

Another approach is &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijar.2008.09.005&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&quot;open Bayes&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, a Bayesian approach that attempts to assign some probability to &quot;hypotheses not considered explicitly&quot;.  Elmar Kriegler (who wrote the DOECLIM climate model I use) has written &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pik-potsdam.de/members/kriegler/publications&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;a number of papers&lt;/a&gt; on &quot;imprecise probability&quot; and belief functions.

Another Bayesian approach is &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI4064.1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;robust Bayes&lt;/a&gt;, which considers a whole family of possible priors and computes the range of posteriors that can arise from these priors.

Alternative approaches to decision making (i.e., not expected utility maximization) include &quot;robust decision making&quot;, which is to give up on fully characterizing uncertainty, and to find policies that are &quot;robust&quot; to errors in your uncertainty assumptions.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rand.org/about/people/l/lempert_robert_j.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Rob Lempert&lt;/a&gt; has written a lot on this; see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rand.org/international_programs/pardee/methods/robust-decisions-2010.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

Most Bayesian statisticians take a rather simple approach:  they just explore the sensitivity of the conclusions to different prior and likelihood assumptions, and leave it at that.  If the results are sensitive to assumptions, so be it.  Policy turns this into a harder problem:  you know your uncertainty estimates are sensitive to assumptions, but you still have to make a decision anyway.  It&#039;s a very hard problem!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/10/15/this-weeks-finds-week-304/#comment-2239&quot;&gt;Giampiero Campa&lt;/a&gt;.

There may be some classical control theory approaches to the policy problem, but most of them take a dynamic programming approach as in the economics paper you linked.  The hydrology thesis involves a state estimation problem, which is different from the problems I usually consider, which are parameter estimation problems.

The parameters in Table 1 are only the ones that I am treating as uncertain.  There are many more parameters in the models, whose values are not given in our paper.  For those, you&#039;d have to go back to the original source papers where those models were published.

You might be able to reimplement the AMOC model from scratch, but the climate model is a bit finicky (it uses perturbation theory), and the carbon model precomputes lookup tables so it&#039;s fast enough.  (Also, I&#039;m not totally sure if it&#039;s well documented enough in the original paper to easily recode.)

We intend to eventually release Fortran code for this model, as part of our economic integrated assessment model, but only after we write a paper documenting it.  That probably won&#039;t happen for at least 6 months.  You could write the original authors of these models for their code.  (That&#039;s what I did.)  I don&#039;t know whether they&#039;d share it with you.  Right now we don&#039;t have permission from them to release it.

You&#039;re correct that the climate and carbon modules are ultimately used to produce temperature histories, which are what drives the AMOC model.  If you have another way of getting temperature histories, you can run them through the AMOC model directly.  We coupled in the other modules in order to propagate climate uncertainty through the AMOC model.]]></description>

I don&#039;t understand the article you&#039;re pointing to, but it&#039;s got some interesting stuff in it:

&#8226; Magnus Hennlockyz, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rff.org/RFF/Documents/RFF-DP-09-19.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Robust control in global warming management: an analytical dynamic integrated assessment&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; Imperfect measurement of uncertainty (deeper uncertainty) in climate sensitivity is introduced in a two-sectoral integrated assessment model (IAM) with endogenous growth, based on an extension of DICE. The household expresses ambiguity aversion and can use robust control via a `shadow ambiguity premium&#039; on social carbon cost to identify robust climate policy feedback rules that work well over a range such as the IPCC climate sensitivity range. Ambiguity aversion, in combination with linear damage, increases carbon cost in a similar way as a low pure rate of time preference.  However, ambiguity aversion in combination with non-linear damage would also make policy more responsive to changes in climate data observations. Perfect ambiguity aversion results in an infinite expected shadow carbon cost and a zero carbon consumption path. Dynamic programming identifies an analytically tractable solution to the IAM.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&#039;Deeper uncertainty&#039; is a concept introduced by Knight.  I don&#039;t know if I like it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Already Knight (1971) suggested that for many choices the assumption of known probability distributions is too strong and therefore distinguished between `measurable uncertainty&#039; (risk) and `unmeasurable uncertainty&#039;, reserving the latter denotation to include also unknown probabilities. In the literature, unmeasurable uncertainty has been named Knightian uncertainty, deeper uncertainty or simply uncertainty to distinguish it from risk. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There&#039;s a lot of math in this paper.  Amusingly, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rff.org/RFF/Documents/RFF-DP-09-19.pdf#page=12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;page 12&lt;/a&gt; features a key concept from information geometry: the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&#039;Kullback-Leibler distance&#039;&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It took me a while to read all this but it was definitely worthy. 

I am tempted of writing the model down using a system description language (the code would really look like the last figure) and do some simulations. Then i guess one could find a robust control law (that is, a policy) to minimize some weighted cost function while keeping into account the uncertainty. 

This would be a great application of control but I haven&#039;t found much (actually any) literature from the control engineering side. This thesis http://academic.csuohio.edu/embedded/Publications/Thesis/Vinay_thesis.pdf only deals with estimation, and it&#039;s just an hydrology problem.

Question (for Nathan), are all the numerical parameters that characterize the models given in the paper ? I see there are a bunch of numerical parameters in Table 1, are those the only parameters needed ? If not, is there a place where i can download the code ?

Another question, the climate and carbon cycle modules seem to be only needed to generate a global average temperature history. So in theory one could just give different temperature histories to the AMOC model and still get approximate answers using only the AMOC module, is that right ? 

I guess anyway that at the end the best way to generate temperature histories is having a climate model, that way you can also play with more parameters and see the effect (I&#039;m just checking my understanding here).]]></description>

Drifting further off-topic, here is another intriguing example of a possible link between &quot;lifestyle&quot;, survival and environment. Scientific American published an article ca. twenty years ago (Google tells me the author was Bert L. Vallee, &quot;Alcohol in the Western World&quot;, June 1998) about how the widespread use of fermented beverages in all traditional cultures (as well as of boiled beverages such as tea) can be understood as an adaptation to a world in which running water was more often than not a vector for disease. It seems that until the late 19th century many people in Europe spent their lives more or less permanently inebriated! The temperance movement only became effective when modern sanitation methods made water and other non-alcoholic beverages safe for drinking.

Far-fetched? Perhaps not. Until a generation ago, it was still possible to hear elders from the more backward rural areas in the South Europe attribute their advanced age to the wholesome habit of tippling, drinking nothing else! This strange attitude to alcoholism makes sense if we recall that when public health officials started monitoring the quality of water from public fountains in smaller towns and villages (as late as the 1940&#039;s), many were found to be unsuited to human consumption (mostly due to percolates from tilled fields and livestock entering the water table). Several centuries ago the problem can have been only worse.]]></description>
