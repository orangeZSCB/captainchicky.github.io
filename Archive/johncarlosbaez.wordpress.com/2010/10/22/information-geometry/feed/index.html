					<description><![CDATA[Towards the end of the article there is this description of 
the Fischer metric as a metric on &#039;x_i&#039; space where these
 x_i are averages of the random variables. I always thought
 it was the parameter space (lambda_i in the article) which received the metric on its tangent space. Now one may &#039;reparametrize&#039; this space in terms of averages of X_i (which
 I am not sure if one can always do). But what makes us want to see it this way?]]></description>

I don&#039;t know about that.  If you give me a link, I might say something about it sometime.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
What’s the connection between these Lagrange Multipliers and the ones from calc 3?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

They&#039;re exactly the same!  We use Lagrange multipliers whenever we want to maximize something subject to some constraints.  Here we are trying to maximize entropy

$latex \mathrm{tr}(\rho \ln \rho)$

subject to some constraints

$latex \mathrm{tr}(X_i \rho) = x_i $

Think of $latex \rho$ as an $latex n \times n$ self-adjoint matrix that you get to vary, and $latex X_i$ as some fixed self-adjoint matrices.   Since the matrix $latex \rho$ has a lot of entries this is a multivariable calculus problem with a lot of variables.  To solve it, you need to know a bit about the logarithm of a matrix (which I explained).  So, most people taking Calculus 3 couldn&#039;t do this problem, but it&#039;s a great test of ones skill, and it&#039;s fundamental to statistical mechanics.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
And what’s the significance of this being a Riemannian metric, as opposed to any other metric or semi pseudo quasi metric?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Well, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_geometry&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Riemannian geometry&lt;/a&gt; is the math that Einstein used to study curved spacetimes, so a vast amount is known about it.  Since I used to work on quantum gravity, I like this branch of math, and I&#039;m eager to see how it applies to the study of information.

For example, there&#039;s a nice theory of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;geodesics&lt;/a&gt;, which are the &#039;best approximations to a straight line in a curved space&#039;.  In information geometry, it turns out that if you have some data and you want to choose the hypothesis that best fits this data, you sometimes want to draw a geodesic from the probability distribution given by your data to the surface that includes all the hypotheses you&#039;re considering.

That was a pretty vague remark, but later in this series I&#039;ll explain it!  So far I&#039;ve written 5 posts in this series, but I&#039;m really just getting started.  I quit for a while because I didn&#039;t want it to overwhelm the main point of this blog: how scientists can help save the planet.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So stupid question maybe, but it is not clear to me why $latex g_ij$ so defined is the real part of the metric. 

My problem is the following: by taking the double derivative of $latex Z$, you get a totally symmetrized (and thus Real product of operators): 

$latex \mathrm{Tr}(X_i X_j (\lambda^k X_k)^m + X_i (\lambda^k X_k)X_j(\lambda^k X_k)^{m-1} + \cdots + X_i  (\lambda^k X_k)^m X_j)$

and it is really not clear to me that that is equal to the real part of the double moment which is

$latex (m+1)/2 * {\mathrm{Tr}(X_i X_j (\lambda^k X_k)^m + X_j X_i (\lambda^k X_k)^m)}$]]></description>
