A possible mondegreen here? The right word is &quot;zenith&quot;, which sounds a lot like &quot;azimuth&quot;, as both come from the same Arabic root. From Wikipedia:

&quot;[...] inaccurate reading of the Arabic expression سمت الرأس (samt ar-ra&#039;s) meaning “direction of the head”/&quot;path above the head&quot;, by Medieval Latin scribes in the Middle Ages, probably through Old Spanish. It was incorrectly reduced to &#039;samt&#039; (&quot;direction&quot;) and imprecisely written as &#039;senit&#039;/&#039;cenit&#039; by those scribes. Through Old French &#039;cenith&#039;, Middle English &#039;senith&#039; and finally &#039;zenith&#039; first appears in the 17th century.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/10/11/geometry-puzzle/#comment-1823&quot;&gt;John Baez&lt;/a&gt;.

Well, one way to show that a PARTICULAR pyramid has volume equal to 1/3 times the height times the base area is to dissect a cube into six congruent pyramids. For example, divide the cube [0,1]x[0,1]x[0,1] along the planes x=y, y=z, and z=x. There must be 3!=6 pieces (because each one corresponds to an inequality like x&#060;y&#060;z), and they are clearly congruent by symmetry of the construction. Thus each piece has volume 1/6. You can then check that each one is a pyramid with height 1 and base 1/2. (I once persuaded my aunt of this by slicing an actual block of cheese.)

Once you&#039;ve shown that a particular pyramid has volume (1/3)(height)(base), you can use affine shifts, dissections, etc. to convince yourself that the formula holds for ALL pyramids and cones.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/10/11/geometry-puzzle/#comment-1976&quot;&gt;Tom Leinster&lt;/a&gt;.

Gorgeous stuff as usual, Tom!

&lt;blockquote&gt;
John, your generalization of “shadow area” to take account of multiplicity corresponds exactly to something standard in integral geometry. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Good &#8212; it seemed pretty natural, so it would be depressing if people were so silly as not to have noticed it before.  

By the way, I now think the answer to my &quot;Challenge&quot; is very easy if one lets oneself use a bit of machinery.  Taking a suitable limit, Descartes&#039; theorem gives a special case of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, which says that the integral of the scalar curvature over a surface is 2&#960; times its Euler characteristic.  Namely, it gives the special case where our surface is a sphere embedded in &lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;: it says that the integral of this sphere&#039;s scalar curvature must be 2&#960; &#215; 2 = 4&#960;.  But a round sphere of radius 1 has scalar curvature 1.  So, the area of this sphere must be 4&#960;.  

This could be seen as a pathetically obscurantist way of computing the area of a sphere, but my point is rather to illustrate that the 4&#960; in Descartes&#039; theorem is directly connected to the 4&#960; in the formula for the area of the sphere.  

And probably all this generalizes enormously, and probably that&#039;s already been done.]]></description>

Not only Archimedes, but Socrates as well:

&quot;WASHINGTON—A group of leading historians held a press conference Monday at the National Geographic Society to announce they had &quot;entirely fabricated&quot; ancient Greece, a culture long thought to be the intellectual basis of Western civilization. ... Emily Nguyen-Whiteman, one of the young academics who &quot;pulled a month&#039;s worth of all-nighters&quot; working on the project, explained that the whole of ancient Greek architecture was based on buildings in Washington, D.C., including a bank across the street from the coffee shop where they met to &quot;bat around ideas about mythology or whatever.&quot;

&quot;We picked Greece because we figured nobody would ever go there to check it out,&quot; Nguyen-Whiteman said. &quot;Have you ever seen the place? It&#039;s a dump. It&#039;s like an abandoned gravel pit infested with cats.&quot;]]></description>
