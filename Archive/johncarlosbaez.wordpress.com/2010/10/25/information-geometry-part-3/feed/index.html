					<description><![CDATA[About zero eigenvalues in the density matrix... 
-- When there aren&#039;t any, then it all seems to boil down  to the statement that &quot;all ensembles are gibbs ensembles&quot;.  In retrospect, this seems obvious, yet it also seems rather remarkable, because no one ever seems to come out and say it much (well, in physics, they do, but not in other contexts).  So I think I learned something new here.  (My definition of a &quot;gibbs ensemble&quot; here is &quot;those ensembles which don&#039;t have a zero in the density matrix&quot;, which seems to be a correct definition, right? Or did I miss something?)

-- When there are zero eigenvalues, then I have two knee-jerk reactions:
The first, naive one is &quot;well, gee, you should leave those states out of your Hilbert space; it was an error to include them in the first place&quot;.

That attitude fails because the density depends on lambda, and perhaps, as one moves around on the manifold, the density matrix goes from being positive-definite in &quot;most&quot; locations, to having zero eigenvalues in some.  But if that&#039;s the case, this too strikes me as being remarkable, at least from the physics point of view.

So, envisioning lambda as a proxy for the temperature, or the fugacity, or whatever, this is saying that, for some values of lambda, there is a state that mixes well into the ensemble, and for other lambdas, it fails to mix at all.  I don&#039;t know of any physical system that behaves like this (but maybe my experience is limited).  Its like saying that, while manipulating the temperature, there is one state that suddenly completely stops interacting with the rest of the system. Wow!  This seems like one heck of a discontinuity, suggesting some phase-transition-like behavior.  Call me naive, but describing a model of some kind that exhibits this behaviour seems to be publication-worthy, to me.  Unless there&#039;s a &quot;well-known&quot; one you know...

At any rate, it still suggests a way for proceeding forward: you carve up the manifold into pieces, the edges of which are those values of lambda where the density matrix has a zero eigenvalue.  As one crosses those edges, one should discard (or ad back in) the detached pure state(s) from your Hilbert space, and otherwise proceed with the usual Gibbs-state calculations.  

It would be even more remarkable and amazing if one couldn&#039;t carve up the manifold, say, for example, because the points (values of lambda) for which the density matrix had zeros and where it didn&#039;t were &quot;dense&quot; in each other (in the general topology sense, like rationals dense in reals), or if there was an accumulation point.  Of course, mathematically, I suppose this is possible, but as a physical situation, this would seem to be truly remarkable...]]></description>

Tim: I fixed a bunch of typos in your latex, but the big problem was this: in systems that mix latex and html, like this blog and also the &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-Category Caf&#233;, you have to be incredibly careful about &#060; and &#062; signs, since these play an important role in html.  

In the &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-Caf&#233; you have to be smart enough to use the latex codes \lt and \gt instead of &#060; and &#062; &#8212; otherwise you&#039;ll get in trouble.  

In this blog you can&#039;t even use \lt and \gt &#8212; apparently they get translated into &#060; and &#062; and &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; then cause trouble!   

What you have to do here is use the html codes &#038;lt; and &#038;gt;, even inside latex expressions!  

&lt;img src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/emoticons/spiral_eyes.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;

Yes, that&#039;s the problem...we need to define the differential of $latex \log(\rho)$. We could try to define the logarithm of $latex \rho$ to be $latex \log^+(\rho)$ eigenvector-wise, so that we don&#039;t need $latex \rho$ to be positive definite. $latex \log^+(x)$ is defined to be 0 for $latex x &#060; 0$ and $latex = \log(x)$ otherwise. 

But if we have a path $latex \gamma(t)$ in our manifold such that there is an eigenvector with an eigenvalue $latex \mu(t)$ with $latex \mu(t &#062; 0) &#062; 0$ and $latex \mu(t \leq 0) = 0$ I very much doubt we can find a way to define the differential of $latex \log^+(\rho)$ along this path at $latex  \gamma(0)$.

(Gee, hope the latex works out.)]]></description>

Setting $latex 0 \ln 0 = 0$ is fine, and that&#039;s what people normally do when defining the entropy of a mixed state to be 

$latex S(\rho) = \mathrm{tr}(\rho \ln \rho)$

When the density matrix $latex \rho$ has an eigenvalue equal to 0, they define the operator $latex \rho \ln \rho$ to equal 0 when applied to that eigenvector.

However, here Tim and I are trying to interpret the expression

$latex \mathrm{tr} (\rho \frac{d \ln \rho}{d\lambda^i} \frac{d \ln \rho}{d\lambda^j}) $

and this is trickier.  Indeed it appears, in general, to be ill-defined when $latex \rho$ has zero eignenvalues.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;b&gt;I made a big mistake in this blog entry — and possibly the preceding one!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In fact this mistake affected all three blog entries.  Luckily, it&#039;s easy to fix. 

The problem was that this matrix is not symmetric in the quantum case:

$latex g_{ij} = \mathrm{tr}(\rho \; \partial_i (\mathrm{ln} \, \rho) \; \partial_j (\mathrm{ln} \, \rho))$

The solution is to take the real part!  So now I&#039;ve redefined it:

$latex g_{ij} = \mathrm{Re} \, \mathrm{tr}(\rho \; \partial_i (\mathrm{ln} \, \rho) \; \partial_j (\mathrm{ln} \, \rho))$

I&#039;ve tried to fix this problem everywhere it shows up in my blog entries &#8212; but not in the comments. 

I&#039;ve explained this in more detail in &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/10/29/information-geometry-part-4/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;part 4&lt;/a&gt;, so if you have any questions, that&#039;s the place to ask &#039;em!]]></description>

Ok. You&#039;re probably right, but 

$latex \partial_\mu\partial_\nu \ln \rho$

&quot;feels&quot; better to me for some reason. The fact that it is operator-valued doesn&#039;t bother me too much. For one reason, the metric in my paper with Urs was also a self-adjoint operator. 

I&#039;m looking forward to the next part of this series :)]]></description>

Phorgyphynance made various suggestions, including:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

$latex g_{ij} = - \partial_i \partial_j \ln Z$

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is a great idea!  It&#039;s automatically symmetric.  To see when it&#039;s positive definite, and understand what it &lt;i&gt;means&lt;/i&gt;, I will compute it in terms of the observables $latex X_i$ that I defined.  

&lt;blockquote&gt;

$latex g_{ij} = - \partial_i \partial_j \ln \rho$

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is not a great idea!  This doesn&#039;t parse if $latex g_{ij}$ is supposed to be a tensor (and hopefully a Riemannian metric). Why?  Because $latex \ln\rho$ is an &lt;i&gt;observable-valued&lt;/i&gt; function on $latex M$.  For example, in the quantum case &#8212; the only case I&#039;m having problems with &#8212; it&#039;s an &lt;i&gt;operator-valued&lt;/i&gt; function.  

So then $latex \partial_i \partial_j \ln \rho$ is an &lt;i&gt;operator-valued rank 2 symmetric tensor&lt;/i&gt; on $latex M$, and while that&#039;s probably good for something, it&#039;s not what I&#039;m looking for.

In the classical case $latex \partial_i \partial_j \ln \rho$ is an &lt;i&gt;random-variable-valued rank 2 symmetric tensor&lt;/i&gt;, which is again not what I&#039;m after.

So I prefer the first idea.

I&#039;ve also figured out a bunch of stuff myself, but I&#039;ll let it settle for a while before I write about it.]]></description>
