You should start by playing one on TV, get the hang of it that way, and then parlay it into a full-time job.  Nobody understands math anyway; I&#039;m sure if you string together impressive words in a plausible way you&#039;ll get tenure.

For some reason I&#039;m not getting notifications of comments on that particular &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;-Caf&#233; entry, so I just noticed and replied to &lt;a href=&quot;https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2017/06/the_geometric_mckay_correspond.html#c052386&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;your comments there&lt;/a&gt; today.  They&#039;re really exciting to me!

So exciting, in fact, that I finally wrote Part 2 of this series, both &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2017/07/02/the-geometric-mckay-correspondence-part-2/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2017/07/the_geometric_mckay_correspond_1.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;on the &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;-Caf&#233;&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Last time I sketched how the $latex E_8$ Dynkin diagram arises from the icosahedron.  This time I&#039;m fill in some details.  I won&#039;t fill in &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the details, because I don&#039;t know how!  Working them out is the goal of this series, and I&#039;d like to enlist your help.

(In fact, I&#039;m running this series of posts both here and at the &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;-Category Café.  So far I&#039;m getting more comments over there, so I suspect the serious helping will happen there.

I got more comments from professional pure mathematicians there... not surprising, since &lt;em&gt;Azimuth&lt;/em&gt; is more focused on applied math.  Check out the comments there, and my replies!]]></description>

Giving a nice explanation of in what sense there are 8 spheres&#039; worth of ways for an icosahedron to shrink to zero size is the goal of this series of posts!  It&#039;s utterly non-obvious, and the only way I understand it so far is by following along the proofs in some books.   So, I can&#039;t explain it here.

But we certainly don&#039;t want there to be just &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; way for an icosahedron to shrink to zero size.  There&#039;s just one way in the space

$latex S = \mathbb{C}^2/\Gamma$

but this space has a singularity at the point coming from the origin, which represents the zero-sized icosahedron.  We&#039;re going to replace this space $latex S$ by a subtler space $latex \widetilde{S}$ which is smooth everywhere, and has a map $latex \pi : \widetilde{S} \to S$ sending 8 spheres to the singular point in $latex S.$   This trick, standard in algebraic geometry, is called a &lt;strong&gt;resolution of singularities&lt;/strong&gt;.  But understanding how points on those 8 spheres can be seen as limits of icosahedra shrinking to zero size---that&#039;s the hard part.

Naively, I&#039;d expect $latex \widetilde{S}$ to have a bunch of points that are limits of icosahedra that don&#039;t rotate as they shrink to zero size.  If there were one such point for each icosahedron of given size, that would give one point for each point in $latex \mathrm{SO}(3)/\mathrm{A}_5$ where $latex \mathrm{A}_5$ is the rotational symmetry group of the icosahedron.  $latex \mathrm{SO}(3)/\mathrm{A}_5$ is the space of &#039;visibly distinct icosahedra of given size centered at the origin&#039;.

But this answer is not right so it must be too naive!

There is a lot more to say, but that&#039;s why this is just Part 1.]]></description>

  I don’t understand this last paragraph nearly as well as I’d like!
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, I bet you understand it a lot better than we do! So unless you want to save everything for &quot;next time&quot;, can you give a hint about why these limits are anything but the &quot;obvious one&quot;? (To me, I think the only obvious one is shrinking to zero without spinning around significantly, which I presume corresponds to a single point on one or more of those 8 spheres. Can you give at least one other example of a different kind of limiting point (and the corresponding sequence with a limit), and explain why it&#039;s different?)]]></description>
