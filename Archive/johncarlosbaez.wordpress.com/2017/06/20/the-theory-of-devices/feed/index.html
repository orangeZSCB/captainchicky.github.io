Thank you!  Just very recently, Georgia Benkart and Tom Halverson got a step further: https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01410

I am still trying to figure out a refinement, I hope I&#039;ll manage!]]></description>

Nice!  I hadn&#039;t known, or had forgotten, that you are collaborating with Bruce Westbury.  I really like his paper on a diagrammatic approach to normed division algebras (or more precisely, composition algebras).]]></description>

Indeed, the idea of Blake Stacey is what Bruce and I try to expand upon in https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.3592 - warning: this paper is still work in progress...

(thank you for fixing my syntax!)]]></description>

Hey, that&#039;s cool!  I hadn&#039;t thought of linearizing this category!  This is connected to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2017/06/08/the-mathematics-of-open-reaction-networks/#comment-94239&quot;&gt;Blake Stacey&#039;s comment&lt;/a&gt; on taking formal linear combinations of morphisms in a category to get a new &#039;linear&#039; category.  It&#039;s nice how the representation theory of the symmetric group shows up here.  This could be pretty important, at least in applications of network theory to &lt;em&gt;linear&lt;/em&gt; systems.

By the way, to use TeX here, you have to enclose the math with

&#036;latex  &#036;

with the word &#039;latex&#039; appearing directly after the first dollar sign, no space between, but then a space after it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If I&#039;m not mistaken, $latex \mathrm{FinCorel}$ is also known as the partition category.  The corresponding algebra (a splendid survey is by Halverson and Ram, https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0401314), where you only consider morphisms between sets of a fixed size $latex r$, is the centralizer algebra $latex \mathrm{End}_{\mathfrak S_n}(V^{\otimes r})$ of the symmetric group, $latex V$ being its defining representation, when $latex n$ is at least $latex 2r$.

More precisely, when you compose two morphisms, some blocks may lose contact to the input and the output.  In this case, these blocks (let&#039;s say there are $latex k$ of them) are omitted and the result is multiplied with the $latex k$-th power of a parameter, usually denoted $latex \delta$.

When $latex n$ is small, there is a basis of the centralizer algebra indexed (!) by set partitions into at most $latex n$ blocks.

Still, there are some mysterious open questions...]]></description>
