I&#039;m sure plenty of my readers know more about neural networks than I do.  Thanks to &#039;deep learning&#039;, neural networks are big business now!

A good illustration of this is Google&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tensorflow.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;TensorFlow&lt;/a&gt; project.  It&#039;s an &quot;open-source software library for machine intelligence&quot;, which makes it easy for people to write their own software using neural networks.

The word &quot;TensorFlow&quot; makes me think of monoidal categories and string diagrams---and I don&#039;t think I&#039;m being silly.  Here is their summary:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  TensorFlow<img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between them.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So there are definitely monoidal categories lurking in the background here!  But since this is a highly popular area, I only want to get involved if I can do something interesting: these days I dislike bandwagons, so I only want to jump aboard one if I can take it in a slightly new direction.]]></description>

Sorry for the delayed reply.  Neural networks of various kinds can indeed be seen as morphisms in monoidal categories of various kinds.  These are actually symmetric monoidal categories, and the use of &#039;feedback&#039; means these categories are compact closed or at least traced.

I have been very slowly learning about neural networks to see if there&#039;s anything interesting I can say about them.  Simply describing the relevant monoidal categories is not quite interesting enough for me!]]></description>

After I posted my comment, I realized that &quot;composition&quot; was not the word I should have used for the act of writing diagrams side-by-side.  It was applicable in the looser, colloquial sense of the word, but not the technical one.  But by the time I got back here to correct myself, you&#039;d already made the point better than I could&#8212;so thanks! :-)]]></description>

Hope you&#039;re feeling healthier these days!

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  composition of diagrams calls for something that is like a tensor product.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Actually composition of diagrams, i.e. attaching the outputs of one to the inputs of the next, calls &lt;em&gt;composition&lt;/em&gt;.  It&#039;s an example of composing morphisms in a category:

&lt;img width=&quot;500&quot; src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/diagram_composition.jpg&quot; /&gt;

Setting diagrams side by side is what calls for tensoring.  Tensoring is something you can do with morphisms in a &lt;em&gt;monoidal&lt;/em&gt; category:

&lt;img width=&quot;500&quot; src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/diagram_tensoring.jpg&quot; /&gt;

And then there are linear combinations:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  Taking formal linear combinations of morphisms in one category to obtain another (and seeing what properties the new category inherits from the old as a result) is still a touch too abstract for me to see immediately as the thing I should try.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

You&#039;re not alone!  Everyone is familiar with composing operators: for example, if you fry something and then dump it into a pot of soup, you&#039;re composing operators.  But taking linear combinations of operators is much harder to visualize: for example, the counterintuitive &#039;half-alive, half-dead cat&#039; that Schr&#246;dinger made famous is the result of applying a linear combination of operators to a cat.

Bob Coecke has emphasized this point: when it comes to quantum mechanics, the &lt;em&gt;superposition principle&lt;/em&gt; is the hard part to visualize, while composition and tensoring are easy.   So, it&#039;s good to start by emphasizing the monoidal category, and only later see what you can with linear combinations of morphisms:

&#8226; Bob Coecke, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/0908.1787&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Quantum picturalism&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Abstract.&lt;/strong&gt; The quantum mechanical formalism doesn&#039;t support our intuition, nor does it elucidate the key concepts that govern the behaviour of the entities that are subject to the laws of quantum physics. The arrays of complex numbers are kin to the arrays of 0s and 1s of the early days of computer programming practice. In this review we present steps towards a diagrammatic &#039;high-level&#039; alternative for the Hilbert space formalism, one which appeals to our intuition. It allows for intuitive reasoning about interacting quantum systems, and trivialises many otherwise involved and tedious computations. It clearly exposes limitations such as the no-cloning theorem, and phenomena such as quantum teleportation. As a logic, it supports &#039;automation&#039;. It allows for a wider variety of underlying theories, and can be easily modified, having the potential to provide the required step-stone towards a deeper conceptual understanding of quantum theory, as well as its unification with other physical theories. Specific applications discussed here are purely diagrammatic proofs of several quantum computational schemes, as well as an analysis of the structural origin of quantum non-locality. The underlying mathematical foundation of this high-level diagrammatic formalism relies on so-called monoidal categories, a product of a fairly recent development in mathematics. These monoidal categories do not only provide a natural foundation for physical theories, but also for proof theory, logic, programming languages, biology, cooking,.... The challenge is to discover the necessary additional pieces of structure that allow us to predict genuine quantum phenomena.

Thanks! That does help clarify things.  (I haven&#039;t been completely absent&#8212;I did &lt;a href=&quot;https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/07/light_mills.html#c052209&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;smash a light mill a few weeks ago&lt;/a&gt;&#8212;just busy, distracted and intermittently ill.)  Sometimes, I learn mathematics very slowly.  This typically happens because I find an idea interesting and try to read about it, but every exposition presumes background that I do not have.  Or worse yet, it is not clear from the reading what is new and important, what is new and pedantic detail, and what is the standard background I could get out of a fifty-year-old book, if I only knew which book to retrieve.

I was figuring that the solidification of my idea would require monoidal categories, since composition of diagrams calls for &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt; that is like a tensor product.
