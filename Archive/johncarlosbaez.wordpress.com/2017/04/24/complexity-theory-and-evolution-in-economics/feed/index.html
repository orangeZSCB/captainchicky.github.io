&lt;i&gt;&quot;I think in some sense weather forecasting is easier than economics forecasting because in the former you:&quot;&lt;/i&gt;

What&#039;s much easier than weather forecasting is climate forecasting. The patterns in climate are deterministic and driven by forces that are solidly locked in place, mainly based on the lunisolar orbit -- not much different that the ocean tidal cycles.

A reminder that on the Azimuth Project forum we are making progress in describing the apparently &quot;chaotic&quot; ENSO climate behavior as a straightforward solution to a delayed differential equation. Here the well known long-period tidal cycles reinforced by a seasonal stimulus govern every peak and valley observed.

https://forum.azimuthproject.org/discussion/1471/qbo-and-enso#latest

It&#039;s actually a simple system obscured by the complexity of having to work past a non-linear DiffEq.  None of the standard linear models help much in deducing the pattern, which likely explains why the pattern has remained hidden for so long. This is stuff I presented at the AGU last December, but over the last few months, the model has crystalized into a more concise form.

BTW, that sketched &quot;O&quot; on the cover of the book &quot;Complexity and Evolution&quot; is coincidentally also called Enso -- which means circle in Japanese

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ens%C5%8D

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;The ensō symbolizes absolute enlightenment, strength, elegance, the universe, and mu (the void).&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It&#039;s surely a sign for us to work on the stuff that is solvable!

I think in some sense weather forecasting is easier than economics forecasting because in the former you:

1) know the underlying physics (at every level of the abstraction hierarchy).

2) have really lots of data and measurements to tune your parameters

i think none of the above condition is satisfied in economics, or at least not at a comparable level.

Anyways, it would be nice if one day we could have economic models as detailed as suggested. I am not sure we could &quot;understand&quot; them in the same way we can understand and teach simpler models, but, we could definitely use them to run simulations and test hypotheses related to how individual behavior affects, in aggregate, the whole economy. And it would also help understanding and verifying the assumptions on which simpler models are based.]]></description>

If people are more critical of weather forecasts than economic forecasts, it could be because more people use weather forecasts on a day-to-day basis, and can easily, rapidly tell whether a forecast was correct.  Economic forecasts tend to be more long-range and a bit harder to check.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for posting about this! I will add it to my reading list!

As someone who did a computer science thesis on artificial neural networks, with a blog about personal finance and a interest in understanding human decision making, this is SUPER interesting to me.

I think it&#039;s interesting that Kate Douglas says, &quot;To put this view of macroeconomics into practice, however, might mean making it more like weather forecasting&quot; because we tend to joke that the weather forecasters are always wrong, or that they have the best/worst jobs because they&#039;re just guessing. People don&#039;t want to think of economists like weathermen because when the weatherman is wrong, worst case you have to walk from you car in the rain. When the economists get it wrong, worst case you lose a lot of money!]]></description>

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I don&#039;t really know, and I agree this is unrealistic, but I have a theory: it&#039;s easier to write a program where &quot;disposition to act&quot; &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; affects &quot;disposition to act&quot;, because they are both variables of the same kind.  To get actions to affect dispositions to act, one needs a way to translate actions to dispositions.

A more realistic model might include this.  Of course if we talk to someone we can &lt;em&gt;tell&lt;/em&gt; them our dispositions, but humans as well as animals who don&#039;t talk also modify their dispositions based on actions!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Agent Zero approach is exciting.  I hope this model building initiative gets traction and thrives.  As a layperson I was puzzled by one thing in the Epstein/Chelen article:

Does anyone know why Agent Zero’s current skeletal equations allow for an agent’s “disposition to act” to be influenced by other agents’ disposition to act, but not by other agents’ actual actions?

The article highlights this as crucial, and say that “Despite suspending [this] assumption central to the literature on social transmission … the Agent_Zero model is show to credibly generate a panoply of collective phenomena…”

But I don’t see any explanation why the modelers chose to assume that others’ actions per se have zero influence (in the real world, by contrast, others’ actions superficially seem both more observable and more influential than mere dispositions).]]></description>
