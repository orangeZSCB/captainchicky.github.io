&lt;blockquote&gt; Maybe you changed something like your email address or… something.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

No I didn&#039;t change anything. Apparently all of my comments need now to be approved.....
Anyways thanks for approving. Unfortunately my comment is not so easily to understand without the scatterplot. I wasn&#039;t sure how safe it is to post the plot. For the use of data it was mentioned that one can use it if one mentions the source (i.e. NASA), but for the scatterplots? Did you understand what I was talking about in the comment?]]></description>

Yep. Some things get inevitable lost.
I had written a comment here yesterday, which explains more. 
But I hope it is not inevitable lost. John, what happened to the comment?]]></description>

Not sure what you are saying, @nad.  Data loss in space-science is not uncommon. The motors that move the deep-space dishes jam. Amplifiers burn out.  Distant spacecraft often need electronics upgrades to receive the now-weak signals, and the upgrade is not done on time. Graduate students who drop screwdrivers where they should not go, and delete files that should not be deleted. Add to that bad weather in space and bad weather on the ground... this is the stuff of water-cooler gossip.  Was the stuff of water-cooler gossip. Now we have facebook for that, I suppose.]]></description>

OK. I found some scatterplots under another NASA adress, namely at:
https://omniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/coho/form/voyager1_s.html

John, I&#039;ll send you a screenshot via Email.
I had falsely misiinterpreted the 2011 at the beginning of the x-Axis in that image you show in
https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2017/09/03/voyager-1/#comment-98315
so I had seen the dropoff at End August/Beginning Sept. 2011, but the dropoff is in 2012 not 2011.

And the interactive app at https://omniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/coho/form/voyager1_s.html shows the same dropoff time. The dropoff is by the way apparently the heliospause and not the termination shock. The termination shock was  in 2004: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliosphere#Termination_shock

But the Sorce mission &quot;outcut&quot; which I has seen was  in Sept.5 2011.
However by looking at the Voyager data there was actually indeed a &quot;burst&quot; (and not some instrumental malfunction) in end august/beginning sept 2011 (Radial distance around 118 AU). 
It doesnt look giant, but it is clearly visible. In that screenshot one can see another burst around Sept 26, 2010.....and I looked now again at the Sorce data (http://lasp.colorado.edu/lisird/sorce/sorce_ssi/ts.html)....and again there is an &quot;outcut&quot; (i.e. no data) exactly at that time Sept 26 2010 for all (or at least a lot) of frequencies. 
The bursts look like some really big hydrogen flares and if they were so noticable so far out then this might explain, why the Sorce mission had an &quot;outcut&quot; then.]]></description>

At this point one should mention that it seems that more exactly at the same time of the above dropoff the Sorce Time series:

http://lasp.colorado.edu/lisird/sorce/sorce_ssi/ts.html

display a gap for all(as far as I can tell, I didn&#039;t check all) frequencies, as if there was some very energetic burst, which was cut out because it was an outlier.

Scary?

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2017/09/03/voyager-1/#comment-98315&quot;&gt;John Baez&lt;/a&gt;.

I kind of know nothing at all about space plasma physics, but have a strong &quot;male answer syndrome&quot;. Anything below might be wrong and is totally fictionalized. Still, I think its 100% true. So....

The &#062;0.5MeV/nucleus cut is probably the limit of detector sensitivity, rather than an intentional cut.  I think the detectors are a stack of thin sheets of doped silicon or germanium, and they look for a current of electron/hole pairs when the nucleus goes through.  Less than 500 KeV does not generate enough current for the charge amplifiers to detect. Don&#039;t know if the 511 KeV cut is coincidental, or has something to do with electron mass.  Maybe there is random noise from pair annihilation???

&quot;Principally protons&quot; means that they lost the detector that can tell apart protons from heavier nuclei, but based on earlier experience, they can guess.  This detector does not tell you what the nuclear charge Z is.

A 0.5MeV particle is not relativistic. Since

$latex E^2=p^2c^2+m^2c^4$

I can approximate the kinetic energy by assuming that the momentum $latex p$ is small, so that the velocity $latex v$ is approx $latex v/c=1MeV/1GeV=0.001$ for a 1 MeV proton. (Sadly, I dropped a factor of $latex 1.4 = \sqrt{2}$ in the above.  I&#039;m lazy.)  So, plugging in the speed to light in above gives v = 300 km/sec which is still very fast.  If I type in &quot;speed of solar wind&quot; into the search bar, then NASA tells me that &quot;The solar wind streams off of the Sun in all directions at speeds of about 400 km/s (about 1 million miles per hour). The source of the solar wind is the Sun&#039;s hot corona. The temperature of the corona is so high that the Sun&#039;s gravity cannot hold on to it.&quot;  I conclude that a 1 MeV proton is a little bit slower than the solar wind.  A 0.5 MeV proton is less than half the speed of the solar wind.

In the heliopause, I expect protons to go from solar-wind-speeds---again ---400 km/sec or about 1-2MeV to... what??  Maybe 1/10th the speed of solar wind??  That is, maybe 0.1 MeV, which is a lot less than 0.5MeV of the detector limit.   There might be a lot of protons (and helium nuclei, and nitrogen and oxygen and carbon) floating around up there, but, at speeds of &quot;only&quot; a hundred-thousand miles per hour, these are much too slow for the detector to register  them.  From the detectors point of view, the slow protons/nuclei are invisible.  Thus, the count drops to almost zero.

Homework assignments: find the factor of $latex \sqrt{2}$ above. Make an estimate for the energy of helium and carbon at solar-wind speeds. Assume that the heliopause is a perfect gas, having a Boltzmann distribution of velocity, and estimate the percentage of protons travelling faster than 0.5MeV. The above graph suggests that only about 1 out of 25 protons are moving faster than 0.5 MeV.  What is the temperature of this gas? How does it compare to the temperature of the corona?]]></description>

Cool!  I should be able to read about exactly what broke on Voyager 1; I just haven&#039;t gotten around to it.   Here&#039;s something on Voyager 1 that was working on October 2011, after that other thing broke:

The caption on Wikipedia says

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  Readings from LA1 instrument on Voyager 1 consisting of collisions of greater than 0.5 MeV/nuc nuclei, principally protons, and is sensitive to low-energy phenomena in interplanetary space
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The dropoff of these protons is apparently due to passing through the termination shock (although I&#039;m a bit confused about the timing here).]]></description>

<p>The caption on Wikipedia says</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Readings from LA1 instrument on Voyager 1 consisting of collisions of greater than 0.5 MeV/nuc nuclei, principally protons, and is sensitive to low-energy phenomena in interplanetary space
</p></blockquote>
<p>The dropoff of these protons is apparently due to passing through the termination shock (although I&#8217;m a bit confused about the timing here).</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Regarding the broken &quot;solar wind&quot; instrument -- I worked on Pioneer 10/11 as a teenager(!) - it had a number of &quot;particle telescopes&quot; on it.  They&#039;re called &quot;telescopes&quot; because they are collimated, directional, although there is no lensing of any sort. They were optimized for different kinds of particles: e.g. heavy charged nuclei - oxygen, carbon, nitrogen - and telling these apart so that you know what the mix is. The detector is tuned to work best at typical solar-wind energies.  But there are other detectors; one for low-energy protons, one for high-energy protons, one for electrons, one for  gamma rays.  Each of these are mildly sensitive to some of the other particle types. I assume the Voyager has a mix of these, also.

I&#039;m guessing that the &quot;solar wind detector&quot; is the one that can distinguish the different kinds of nuclei.  If that&#039;s broken, then you won&#039;t know the abundance of each, but you can still measure the overall charged particle flux and direction with the other instruments.]]></description>
