					<description><![CDATA[The monoidal Grothendieck construction plays an important role in our team&#039;s work on network theory, in at least two ways. First, we use it to get a symmetric monoidal category, and then an operad, from any network model. Second, we use it to turn any &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/05/01/decorated-cospans&quot;&gt;decorated cospan category&lt;/a&gt; into a &#039;structured cospan category&#039;. I haven&#039;t said anything about structured cospans yet, but they are an alternative approach to open systems, developed by my grad student Kenny Courser, that I&#039;m very excited about. Stay tuned!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[John Foley has been working out some nice example problems where a collection of agents need to move along the edges of a graph from specified start locations to specified end locations, taking routes that minimize their total fuel usage.  However, there are some constraints.  Some edges can only be traversed by specified &lt;i&gt;teams&lt;/i&gt; of agents: they can&#039;t go alone.  Also, no one agent is allowed to run out of fuel.

This is a nice problem because while it&#039;s pretty simple and specific, it&#039;s representative of a large class of problems where a collection of agents are trying to carry out tasks together.  &#039;Moving along the edge of a graph&#039; can stand for a task of any sort.  The constraint that some edges can only be traversed by specified teams is then a way of saying that certain tasks can only be accomplished by teams.

Furthermore, there are nice software packages for optimization subject to constraints.  For example, John likes one called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.choco-solver.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Choco&lt;/a&gt;.  So, we plan to use one of these as part of the project.

What makes this all &lt;i&gt;compositional&lt;/i&gt; is that John has expressed this problem using our &#039;network model&#039; formalism, which I began sketching in &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2017/10/31/complex-adaptive-systems-part-6/&quot;&gt;Part 6&lt;/a&gt;.  This allows us to assemble tasks for larger collections of agents from tasks for smaller collections.]]></description>

Hi!  Yes, those three x&#039;s should be e&#039;s.  Thanks!  A fixed version is &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/network_models.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks for noticing that the diagram of the permutation is &#039;upside down&#039;.  Of course it&#039;s just a convention, but I personally prefer to read the permutation from top to bottom, like you.  I will argue with my coauthors, if necessary.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi,
On the page 11 of the preprint, theorem 12, third dot, I believe you wrote &quot;x&quot; instead of &quot;e&quot;: $latex (g_1\sqcup g_2)(e), g_1(e), g_2(e)$.

Also, on page 8 of the preprint, I wonder if the diagram of permutations (1526374) is upside down, or if it is the way people in the area draw them.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi

I am a huge fan of this blog series. Thank you for sharing.

The link to &quot; John Baez, John Foley, Blake Pollard and Joseph Moeller, Network models.&quot; is broken, Could you point me to the right link?

Thanks in advance]]></description>
