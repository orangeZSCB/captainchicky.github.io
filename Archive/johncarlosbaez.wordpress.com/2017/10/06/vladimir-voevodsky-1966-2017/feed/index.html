					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2017/10/06/vladimir-voevodsky-1966-2017/#comment-99370&quot;&gt;John Baez&lt;/a&gt;.

I remember when mathematicians lamented over &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Mathematica&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Russell-Whitehead&#039;s&lt;/a&gt; failure to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;subdue logic with mathematics&lt;/a&gt;. Nowadays I wonder if- besides putting mathematicians out of work, if automated theorem proving would also lead to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_takeover&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;robot uprising&lt;/a&gt; and extinction of humanity as we know it.

But really, I was wondering if this, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy_type_theory#Equality&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;It treats the fundamental concept of equality in a brand new way!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, was less dangerous in terms of physics where a classical &quot;equality&quot; operator would work for say, identical particles, while this more potent version would lead to actual physical (visible) paths. For instance, Faraday&#039;s idea of magnetic lines of force are considered a virtual if practical artifice, but the idea that those lines were actually &quot;instantiated&quot; (borrowing a software engineering term to distinguish pointers from &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; references) in terms of visible lines in iron filings. On this matter I once had a long discussion with an x-ray physicist who refused to acknowledge the existence of those lines in iron filings. This seemed to me a bit too much like arguing &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenology_(particle_physics)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;phenomenology&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Star_(film)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Thermostellar Bomb #20&lt;/a&gt;.



It also hasn&#039;t escaped my attention that the diplomatic/legal uses of the logical &quot;or&quot; (exclusive xor vs. inclusive ior) are often to blame for causing many misunderstandings (I have on only one occasion also noticed a similar ambiguity in the abuse of the logical &quot;and&quot;). The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;xor&lt;/a&gt; operation is notoriously useful from computer graphics to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_NOT_gate&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;quantum computing&lt;/a&gt;.



And similarly QT and SR are wrought with logical stumpers caused say, whenever one particle is said to take two paths through &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;two slits&lt;/a&gt; at the same time or any notion that it is more lucrative to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;age wine at the speed of light&lt;/a&gt; than in caves.


Astonomy is also wrought with many logical head scratchers. If an astronomer looks through the eyepiece of a really big telescope, way back in time, they should in principle be able to see the proton that&#039;s currently residing in the back of their own head: because (most?) protons have allegedly been around since the Big Bang. So how&#039;d it get there? Any explanation of an FTL expansion period won&#039;t prevent a flood of more &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;sci.physics FAQ&lt;/a&gt; questions about say, ...how long a meter stick is in a galaxy that&#039;s 13 billion light-years away compared to how long it is right here and now and whether or not Doppler shift calculations of velocities from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-slit_spectroscopy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;long-slit spectrographs&lt;/a&gt; are corrected for such dispersions.

So- whenever I hear anything about an improved logic or definitions of &quot;equivalent&quot;, &quot;equal&quot;, &quot;equality&quot;, &quot;identical&quot;, ... my ears perk up, because such things seem terribly fundamental.]]></description>

&quot;This was a tribute, not a psychological study, so I shouldn’t be trying to draw general conclusions, just talk about one way a life can be lived. But I feel I understand how some people are driven to brand new ideas through immense mental turmoil combined with a strong love of order and beauty. I was dissatisfied with how some obituaries focused solely on Voevodsky’s mathematical achievements and not his actual life: they presented a superficial, shiny, fake version of the real person.&quot; Thank you, this is exactly my feeling as well (and I liked the version before you edited even better!).

&quot;I agree that Vladimir had an unconventional life, by the standards of many mathematicians. But I see no evidence that his mathematical work was enhanced by this, rather than produced in spite of it. Even if it were enhanced by it, for many others this would not be the case, and indeed there are many people on this planet with unconventional lives, who are at the same time not mathematical geniuses. Therefore it seems wrong to me—and even potentially damaging, to people who may be enduring similar struggles—to romanticise the idea of the troubled mathematical genius.&quot; Come on, any attempt to deduce universal psychological laws from VV&#039;s life sounds ridiculous enough.

If there was a link between his struggles and accomplishments, I&#039;d search for it in a genuine and uncompromising attitude without safeguards, both in mathematics and in life, though I doubt VV would approve any speculations on this subject.

Yet he was open about his experiences and his demons, including alcohol, and fighting them with admirable energy, They shaped his personality, whether we like it or not. Eluding them (as in the obituary of the nyt) amounts to considering them as shameful. I do not think they were, and we certainly have no right to judge.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  I have difficulty with the implication that psychological difficulties can be advantageous for creative mathematical work.  Just seeing both properties present in a single person does not imply causation, in any direction.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Maybe I said things the wrong way.  This was a tribute, not a psychological study, so I shouldn&#039;t be trying to draw general conclusions, just talk about &lt;em&gt;one way a life can be lived&lt;/em&gt;.   But I feel I understand how some people are driven to brand new ideas through immense mental turmoil combined with a strong love of order and beauty.   I was dissatisfied with how some obituaries focused solely on Voevodsky&#039;s mathematical achievements and not his actual life: they presented a superficial, shiny, fake version of the real person.

Of course obituaries may not be the place for honesty.  But the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/obituaries/vladimir-voevodsky-revolutionary-mathematician-dies-at-51.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; filled in some more details:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  Vladimir Voevodsky was born in Moscow on June 4, 1966. His father, Alexander, directed a laboratory in experimental physics at the Russian Academy of Sciences; his mother, Tatyana Voevodskaya, was a chemistry professor at Moscow University.
  
  Vladimir was kicked out of high school three times, once for disagreeing with his teacher’s assertion that Dostoyevsky, who died in 1881, was pro-Communist. He was also kicked out of Moscow University after failing academically, having stopped attending classes that he considered a waste of time.
  
  He continued to study mathematics independently, however, and with the mathematician Mikhail Kapranov he published several papers so impressive that he was invited to enroll at Harvard as a graduate student, despite never having applied for admission there and holding no formal undergraduate degree.
  
  Once enrolled he again failed to attend lectures — but his body of research was so astonishing, colleagues said, that no one cared. He graduated in 1992 and remained at Harvard to do a fellowship.

<blockquote><p>
  I have difficulty with the implication that psychological difficulties can be advantageous for creative mathematical work.  Just seeing both properties present in a single person does not imply causation, in any direction.

<p>Maybe I said things the wrong way.  This was a tribute, not a psychological study, so I shouldn&#8217;t be trying to draw general conclusions, just talk about <em>one way a life can be lived</em>.   But I feel I understand how some people are driven to brand new ideas through immense mental turmoil combined with a strong love of order and beauty.   I was dissatisfied with how some obituaries focused solely on Voevodsky&#8217;s mathematical achievements and not his actual life: they presented a superficial, shiny, fake version of the real person.</p>
<p>Of course obituaries may not be the place for honesty.  But the <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/obituaries/vladimir-voevodsky-revolutionary-mathematician-dies-at-51.html" rel="nofollow">New York Times</a></em> filled in some more details:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Vladimir Voevodsky was born in Moscow on June 4, 1966. His father, Alexander, directed a laboratory in experimental physics at the Russian Academy of Sciences; his mother, Tatyana Voevodskaya, was a chemistry professor at Moscow University.</p>
<p>  Vladimir was kicked out of high school three times, once for disagreeing with his teacher’s assertion that Dostoyevsky, who died in 1881, was pro-Communist. He was also kicked out of Moscow University after failing academically, having stopped attending classes that he considered a waste of time.</p>
<p>  He continued to study mathematics independently, however, and with the mathematician Mikhail Kapranov he published several papers so impressive that he was invited to enroll at Harvard as a graduate student, despite never having applied for admission there and holding no formal undergraduate degree.</p>
<p>  Once enrolled he again failed to attend lectures — but his body of research was so astonishing, colleagues said, that no one cared. He graduated in 1992 and remained at Harvard to do a fellowship. In 2002 he moved to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, where he spent the rest of his career.
