					<description><![CDATA[I think its important to draw some attention to Steve Bannon&#039;s business and record on climate change. The greenhouse effect physics behind the science.

In 1996 Steve Bannon was inadvertently given an experimental mock exoplanet &quot;Earth in a bottle.&quot; What the &quot;failed&quot; biosphere 2 results and climate scientists actually said then is that &quot;by the year 2100 the &quot;Earth&#039;s atmosphere&quot; will be difficult to breathe.&quot; Bannon and oil tycoon Bass, and company didn&#039;t like the results. It&#039;s interesting that those results are goal oriented. $200 million in oil money is spent on space colony circumstantial climate research. It matters since others have independently derived the same prognosis. In any case the results concur with Climate and Nasa scientist James Lovelock and the Gaia hypothesis. What&#039;s different today is the potential to mobilize &quot;Mitigation.&quot; &quot;Planet Waste&quot; in all its forms ultimately informs the needed social and economic information and suggests the practical building blocks needed to rebuild and sustain built and renewable environments. Social environmental economic development is a public response vector to Bannon, Trump and the Security Council.
