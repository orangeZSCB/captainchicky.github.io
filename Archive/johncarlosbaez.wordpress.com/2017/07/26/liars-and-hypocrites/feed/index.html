I&#039;m a bit late to the party here, but thank you John for a very interesting post, and thank you Matt (and others) for interesting comments. Matt, you make a very good point, although I do not agree that &quot;A strategy against climate change that focuses on people making best choices through individual willpower is doomed.&quot; (Though focusing solely on that is not the best idea.)

We are in a tragedy of the commons (or as optimists call it, a drama of the commons). Elinor Ostrom, who won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2009, wrote that successful management of commons requires shared, reliable information; an agreement to jointly share responsibility; knowledge of what everyone else is doing; and a desire to be seen as trustworthy reciprocator. (Ostrom, A polycentric approach for coping with climate change, https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/9034/WPS5095_WDR2010_0021.pdf). Without these, we are unlikely to get widespread support for the policies (like carbon taxes and strong international agreements) that will do the job. Commons are managed through collective action, which can be effective at all levels starting with the individual. Widespread hypocrisy repels people psychologically and undermines collective action.

There are other issues that share various aspects of climate change to different degrees (such as free riding, unpriced externalities, and a need for collective action). I&#039;m thinking of things like voting, taxes, vaccination, rubbish, labour rights, public safety, human rights. Progress was difficult in all these areas for many of the same reasons that progress in climate change is difficult. A society which exhibits widespread hypocrisy in any of these risks backsliding.

I look forward to a day in which a multinational would not even consider moving an industrial facility to a country with unpriced fossil fuels, because they know it is a wrong thing to do.

There is one small complication. Leonardo DiCaprio (or whoever) could easily buy some land and plant trees. He would then be carbon neutral (or carbon negative) in his personal life. But I suspect he would still rub some people up the wrong way for flying around the world preaching climate change.]]></description>

I&#039;ve been neglecting the 3rd world in my concerns about humanity. The floods do not concern me except to the extent they are probably part of the irreversible loss of snow-caps that enable annual spring-time water.  Long term, the prevention of ice ages is a good argument for CO2, but short term, the rapid change in the biosphere will cause disruptions to humanity and other species.  But humanity advances, especially in the 3rd world, are far outstripping the negative side effects of their increase use of fossil fuels. Solar cells will likely make clean water plentiful.  Assuming the &quot;rise of the machines&quot; does not make it irrelevant.  So I&#039;m left with species destruction, and the possibility that lack of coral could ultimately lead to excess human stress in some unforeseen way. U.S. wealth is so great (partly from unnecessary  use of fossil fuels), 2x more hurricanes with 2x the dollar-destructive power is not concerning to me. Solar cell production is doubling every 3 years. The energy needed to produce them is a small fraction of the energy they supply.  In about 5 years, the solar industry will have installed more daytime watts than the U.S. electrical grid supplies. In 5 years more solar will be installed each year than coal-fired plants. There&#039;s no doubt climate change deniers have been ridiculous.  Granted, we&#039;ve added 50% more CO2 than we needed to stop the ice ages. But I feel the discussion is sometimes like Washington: both sides argue to deceive the public into giving support for one side or the other. The thing that scares me is how fast our economic machine is changing everything, including humanity and our view of it.]]></description>

  What’s bad about global warming?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here&#039;s one of many answers:

&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2017/8/31/b58db7fb3c044a59bd3a492822713467_6.jpg&quot; /&gt;

This summer, while Americans were watching Houston drown under Hurricane Harvey, floods were disrupting life for 20 million people in India, Bangladesh and Nepal.  When I last checked they killed at least 1,200 people. In India&#039;s financial capital Mumbai, people struggled to evacuate as transportation was paralysed and water rose almost 2 meters in some parts of the city. Over in Bangladesh, 1/3 of the country was under water!

Of course flooding happens in South Asia every year during the monsoon season, June to September. But this year&#039;s floods were much worse than usual. Why?

Are floods getting worse because of climate change? Hurricanes and monsoons start with the evaporation of warm ocean water. The Earth is the hottest it&#039;s been in the last 100,000 years—and getting hotter. So it would be very strange if floods &lt;em&gt;weren&#039;t&lt;/em&gt; getting worse.

Attributing specific floods to climate change is a tricky and interesting subject, much discussed in the recent scientific literature.   But let&#039;s focus on an easier question: what was the underlying atmospheric physics behind Hurricane Harvey&#039;s unusual behavior?  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/08/did-climate-change-intensify-hurricane-harvey/538158/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Warmer waters in the Gulf were crucial&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Harvey benefited from unusually toasty waters in the Gulf of Mexico. As the storm roared toward Houston last week, sea-surface waters near Texas rose to between 2.7 and 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit above average. These waters were some of the hottest spots of ocean surface in the world. The tropical storm, feeding off this unusual warmth, was able to progress from a tropical depression to a category-four hurricane in roughly 48 hours.

“This is the main fuel for the storm,” says Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist at the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research. “Although these storms occur naturally, the storm is apt to be more intense, maybe a bit bigger, longer-lasting, and with much heavier rainfalls [because of that ocean heat].”

This also suggests an explanation for one of Harvey’s strangest and scariest behaviors. The storm intensified up until the moment of landfall, achieving category-four strength hours before it slammed into the Texas coast. This is not only rare for tropical cyclones in the western Gulf of Mexico: It may be unique. In the past 30 years of records, no storms west of Florida have intensified in the last 12 hours before landfall.

Why do storms normally weaken—and why didn’t Harvey? As mentioned above, hurricanes feed and grow on warm ocean surface waters. But as they grow, their strong winds often pick up seawater, churning the oceans and moving the warmest waters deep below the surface. The same winds also bring newer, colder water closer to the atmosphere, which usually serves to drain energy and weaken the storm.

That didn’t happen with Harvey. The hurricane churned up water 100 or even 200 meters below the surface, said Trenberth, but this water was still warm---meaning that the storm could keep growing and strengthening. “Harvey was not in a good position to intensify the way it did, because it was so close to land. It’s amazing it was able to do that,” he told me.&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

I have believed in global warming since a popular science article I read in about 1986. I do not believe it is a significant threat to humanity.  I used to care about other species, but now I do not.  Maybe it is because I find it easier to not care, given the amount of destruction so far, and the destruction that is on the way. But higher CO2 gives more carbon and more water in the atmosphere for plants, the primary limiting factors to all biological life, so it&#039;s not even clear to me that global warming is a bad thing. Especially since there are molecules that can be released to the upper atmosphere that will immediately stop the heat without reducing the CO2.  Ice ages are far more destructive, and appear to have occurred from too little CO2. The next and subsequent ice ages have been prevented thanks to CO2.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What&#039;s bad about global warming? Plants generally love the doubling of CO2, possibly offsetting the destruction of marine life. Shifting of farmlands is probably not going happen faster than we can adapt, as evidenced by Netherlands (of all places) being 2nd largest exporter (in dollars) of vegetables. I read a study that concluded it has no impact on manufacturing. It appears solar cells for fueling cars and homes (with thorium reactors for night?) could stop the CO2 increases.  Worse, I do not even see global warming as relevant.  We will still continue destroying species at roughly 5,000 the background rate until we are left with only the ones we find economically relevant.  But it&#039;s not exactly &quot;us&quot; destroying biology.   The &quot;rise of the machines&quot; makes other species irrelevant to the point of unintentional destruction.  Even human thought and labor are already so irrelevant that it&#039;s hard to imagine of what use humanity will be to our economic machine 50 years from now other than spending basic guaranteed income.  Free money destroys culture and seems to create needless violence (research on the result of the past 50 years of U.S. welfare).  Even now &quot;the machines&quot; don&#039;t even need capital to suddenly change everything via 1 or 2 decent programmers and/or someone making good marketing decisions.  I mention capital because it has always been thought of as the tool by which the machines and a few capitalists would enslave everyone else without government intervention.  The tech that makes capital irrelevant could make everyone wealthier and more independent (for example: solar cells and hydroponic gardening packages for your backyard, not to mention peer-to-peer blockchain technology replacing governments and financial industry). But I do not believe the physics that governs evolution (closed thermodynamic system receiving energy and emitting energy and entropy to the universe) that results in economizing structures of lower and lower entropy per mole is going to forever blindly find it optimal to merely fulfill human desires. Even now thinking we are somehow in control is a suspect idea. We are merely one of the many resulting enzymatic pathways physics uses to move matter via potentials.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What&#8217;s bad about global warming? Plants generally love the doubling of CO2, possibly offsetting the destruction of marine life. Shifting of farmlands is probably not going happen faster than we can adapt, as evidenced by Netherlands (of all places) being 2nd largest exporter (in dollars) of vegetables. I read a study that concluded it has no impact on manufacturing. It appears solar cells for fueling cars and homes (with thorium reactors for night?) could stop the CO2 increases.  Worse, I do not even see global warming as relevant.  We will still continue destroying species at roughly 5,000 the background rate until we are left with only the ones we find economically relevant.  But it&#8217;s not exactly &#8220;us&#8221; destroying biology.   The &#8220;rise of the machines&#8221; makes other species irrelevant to the point of unintentional destruction.  Even human thought and labor are already so irrelevant that it&#8217;s hard to imagine of what use humanity will be to our economic machine 50 years from now other than spending basic guaranteed income.  Free money destroys culture and seems to create needless violence (research on the result of the past 50 years of U.S. welfare).  Even now &#8220;the machines&#8221; don&#8217;t even need capital to suddenly change everything via 1 or 2 decent programmers and/or someone making good marketing decisions.  I mention capital because it has always been thought of as the tool by which the machines and a few capitalists would enslave everyone else without government intervention.  The tech that makes capital irrelevant could make everyone wealthier and more independent (for example: solar cells and hydroponic gardening packages for your backyard, not to mention peer-to-peer blockchain technology replacing governments and financial industry). But I do not believe the physics that governs evolution (closed thermodynamic system receiving energy and emitting energy and entropy to the universe) that results in economizing structures of lower and lower entropy per mole is going to forever blindly find it optimal to merely fulfill human desires. Even now thinking we are somehow in control is a suspect idea. We are merely one of the many resulting enzymatic pathways physics uses to move matter via potentials. The machines are vastly better than biology at every aspect of evolution: capturing energy from the sun, moving matter with that energy, having strong structures to do it, and to model and optimize future scenarios with thinking machines. It&#8217;s taking my children 4 hours a day for 6 years and ~100 grams of grey matter to understand spoken and written Chinese as well as 1 gram of silicon on my smart phone learned in 30 seconds.

That&#039;s a nice description of a certain position.

I reject &#039;utility maximization&#039; as a good description of my behavior: I don&#039;t really believe I&#039;m trying to maximize any simple quantity (though of course my behavior thus far has maximized infinitely many different quantities, most of them completely useless for predicting my future behavior).

But setting that aside: I&#039;m happier when I try to reduce my carbon emissions, but I&#039;d be even happier if there were rules that required me, along with everyone else, to limit my carbon emissions even below my current levels.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Isn&#039;t being a hypocrite just a game-theoretical strategy to the Tragedy of the Commons? A frank hypocrite wants to change the game into co-operative because everybody&#039;s utility would then be greater. During the time the game is still played non co-operatively, the hypocrite tries to maximize his/her utility under the non co-operative rules.

The difference between a frank hypocrite and an ordinary hypocrite is that the frank hypocrite really tries to change the game rules, whereas the ordinary hypocrite does not.

I&#039;m using here &#039;frank hypocrite&#039; to distinguish the concept from the &#039;honest hypocrite&#039; of your post.

In fact it sounds like an interesting question how one would mathematically include changing the game rules as a part of the game itself.]]></description>
