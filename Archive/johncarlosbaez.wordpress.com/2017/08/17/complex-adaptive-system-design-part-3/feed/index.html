					<description><![CDATA[Remember from Part 3: an operad has operations, which are abstract ways of sticking things together. An algebra makes these operations concrete: it specifies some sets of actual things, and how the operations in the operad get implemented as actual ways to stick these things together.

So, an operad $latex O$ can have one algebra in which things are described in a bare-bones, simplified way, and another algebra in which things are described in more detail.  Indeed it will typically have &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; algebras, corresponding to &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; levels of detail, but let&#039;s just think about two for a minute.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Last time I introduced typed operads. A typed operad has a bunch of operations for putting together things of various types and getting new things of various types.

You definitely mean &#039;operations&#039; here.  But the answer to your question here is &#039;yes&#039;, as I explained in my previous comment.  To assert that an operation has the same output regardless of how you permute its inputs, or even to say precisely how the output &lt;em&gt;changes&lt;/em&gt; when you permute the inputs, you need to be able to permute the inputs.

Mathematics has a huge hierarchy of formalisms of varying expressive power, with operads near the bottom---you can only say very simple things with an operad.  Symmetric operads are a wee bit more expressive than nonsymmetric ones.  When you want to say more sophisticated things, you need a more expressive formalism, and you pay the price in increased complication.  The trick is to choose the formalism that&#039;s just expressive enough for your current needs, and know how to hop nimbly between formalisms as your needs change.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2017/08/17/complex-adaptive-system-design-part-3/#comment-97735&quot;&gt;James Smith&lt;/a&gt;.

You need symmetries to express the fact that certain operations are unchanged when you permute their inputs... or to express how certain operations change when you permute their inputs.

For example, there is a &lt;em&gt;nonsymmetric&lt;/em&gt; operad whose algebras are precisely sets equipped with an associative multiplication.  This operad has one type and a binary operation $latex m$ obeying the law

$latex m \circ (m, 1) = m \circ (1, m) $

However, there&#039;s no nonsymmetric operad whose algebras are precisely sets with a &lt;em&gt;commutative&lt;/em&gt; associative operation.   To express that law you need the ability to permute inputs, so you need a symmetric operad.

It appears that for our applications, we want the ability to say things like &#039;connecting boat 1 to boat 2 with a radio channel is the same as connecting boat 2 to boat 1 with a radio channel&#039;.

Most mathematicians use symmetric operads, because in many applications they&#039;re necessary.  We also know it&#039;s pretty easy to switch to nonsymmetric operads when they suffice.  (Technically: there&#039;s a forgetful functor from the category of symmetric operads to the category of nonsymmetric ones, and it has a left adjoint.)  When it comes to writing software, it&#039;s possible that symmetric operads are a bit of a drag and will be avoided unless absolutely necessary.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  Why not just have a different operad with the different inputs?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I suspect you meant &#039;operation&#039; here, not &#039;operad&#039;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I thought of an answer to my question immediately after posting it, although I&#039;m not sure it adds anything.

					<description><![CDATA[Hi,

I&#039;m not sure about the wisdom of permuting inputs. It seems as if it might complicate things horribly. Can you perhaps justify it a little? I guess types would restrict the number of permutations but even then, why bother? Why not just have a different operad with the different inputs?]]></description>
