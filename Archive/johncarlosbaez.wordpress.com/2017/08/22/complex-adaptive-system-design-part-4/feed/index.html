					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2017/08/22/complex-adaptive-system-design-part-4/#comment-97922&quot;&gt;Frank Wilhoit&lt;/a&gt;.

In this post I&#039;m using simple graphs as an example of how operads can be used to assemble networks.  Simple graphs have undirected edges.  But they&#039;re just one example of our approach.  For networks where communication channels are directed, we use graphs that take this into account: for example, &#039;directed graphs&#039;.

Here&#039;s what I said about this issue... with some emphasis added at points where I address the issue you raise:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  There are some restrictions on what counts as a simple graph.  If the vertices are agents of some sort and the edges are communication channels, these restrictions imply:
  
  • We allow at most one channel between any pair of agents, since there&#039;s at most one edge between any two vertices of our graph.
  
  • The channels do not have a favored direction, since there are no arrows on the edges of our graph.
  
  • We don&#039;t allow a channel from an agent to itself, since an edge can&#039;t start and end at the same vertex.
  
  &lt;strong&gt;For other purposes we may want to drop some or all of these restrictions.&lt;/strong&gt;   There is an appalling diversity of options!  We might want to allow multiple channels between a pair of agents.   For this we could use &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multigraph&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;multigraphs&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;strong&gt;We might want to allow directed channels, where the sender and receiver have different capabilities: for example, signals may only be able to flow in one direction.  For this we could use &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;directed graphs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;   And so on.
  
  To avoid sinking into a mire of special cases, we need the full power of modern mathematics.  Instead of separately studying all these various kinds of networks, we need a unified notion that subsumes all of them.
  
  To do this, the Metron team came up with something called a &#039;network model&#039;.  There is a network model for simple graphs, a network model for multigraphs, &lt;strong&gt;a network model for directed graphs&lt;/strong&gt;, a network model for directed graphs with 3 colors of vertex and 15 colors of edge, and more.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I&#039;ll explain the general concept of &#039;network model&#039; later.  First I want to illustrate some things you can do with network models, and I&#039;ll do that next time using simple graphs.  But fear not---our setup can handle a wide variety of networks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think you underrate the importance of directionality in the communications channels.  Quite generally, in networks representing the execution of business processes, if A talks to B but B does not talk to A, that fact is highly significant; and if B does talk to A, it is for a different reason and it transports a payload of a different type.  I do not have any insight into the manner in which this distinction would be expressed in the formalism that you are explaining here and I apologize if this entire comment is a forward reference to a topic that you will introduce later on.]]></description>

Right!

  2)-4) 2^C(t,2) (since each pair of distinguishable vertices can independently be joined by an arc, or not)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If C(t,2) means the binomial coefficient $\binom{t}{2}$, then you&#039;re right!  If

$latex t_1 + \cdots + t_n = t$

then $latex O_G(t_1, \dots, t_n ; t)$ is the set of simple graphs with $latex t$ vertices, so its cardinality is

$latex \displaystyle{ 2^{\binom{t}{2}} } $

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  5) 2^C(3,2)=8 (same reason)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Right again!  In this example $latex A(t)$ is &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; the set of simple graphs wiht $latex t$ vertices, so its cardinality is &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt;

$latex \displaystyle{ 2^{\binom{t}{2}} } $

&lt;strong&gt;Moral:&lt;/strong&gt; In this particular example, the algebra is very similar to the operad it&#039;s an algebra of.  That&#039;s not always true, but every typed operad $latex O$ has an algebra of this kind, with

$latex A(t) = O(t;t)$]]></description>
