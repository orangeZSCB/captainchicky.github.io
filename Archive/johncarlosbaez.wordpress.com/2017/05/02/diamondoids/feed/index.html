&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yes.  I mentioned one in my blog article: &#039;isotetramane&#039;, which is number 4 here:

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Diamondoids.png/440px-Diamondoids.png

You can see that it&#039;s different from its mirror-image form.

Most biological molecules have this property, too.  You may have heard of the sugar called &#039;glucose&#039;.  This comes in two mirror-image forms.  On this planet life mainly uses the right-handed form, called &#039;dextrose&#039;.  It&#039;s &#039;right-handed&#039; in the sense that the polarization of light passing through a solution of dextrose gets rotated clockwise.

There are very slight inherent differences between enantiomers because the weak nuclear force knows the difference between left and right.  Could this be relevant to biology?  And why are most people right-handed, anyway?   I wrote about these puzzles back in &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week73.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&quot;week73&quot;&lt;/a&gt; of This Week&#039;s Finds:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
1) Biological Asymmetry and Handedness, Ciba Foundation Symposium 162, John Wiley and Sons, 1991.

D. K. Kondepudi and D. K. Nelson, Weak neutral currents and the origins of molecular chirality, Nature 314, pp. 438-441.

It&#039;s always puzzled me how humans and other animals could be consistently asymmetric. A 50-50 mix of two mirror-image forms could easily be explained by &quot;spontaneously broken symmetry&quot;, but in fact there are many instances of populations with a uniform handedness. Many examples appear in Weyl&#039;s book &quot;Symmetry&quot; (see &quot;week63&quot;). To take an example close to home, the human brain appears to be lateralized in a fairly consistent manner; for example, most people have the speech functions concentrated in the left hemisphere of their cerebrum - even most, though not all, left-handers.

One might find this unsurprising: it just means that the asymmetry is encoded in the genes. But think about it: how are the genes supposed to tell the embryo to develop in an asymmetric way? How do they explain the difference between right and left? That&#039;s what intrigues me.

Of course, genes code for proteins, and most proteins are themselves asymmetric. Presumably the answer lurks somewhere around here. Indeed, even the amino acids of which the proteins are composed are asymmetric, as are many sugars and for that matter, the DNA itself, which is composed of two spirals, each of which has an intrinsic directionality and hence a handedness. The handedness of many of these basic biomolecules is uniform for all life on the globe, as far as I know.

In the conference proceedings on biological asymmetry, there is an interesting article on the development of asymmetry in C. elegans. Ever since the 1960s, this little nematode has been a favorite among biologists because of its simplicity, and because of the advantages understanding one organism thoroughly rather than many organisms in a sketchy way. I&#039;m sure most of you know about the fondness geneticists have for the fruit fly, but Caenorhabditis elegans is a far simpler critter: it only has 959 cells, all of which have been individually named and studied! There are over 1000 people studying it by now, there is a journal devoted to it - The Worm Breeder&#039;s Gazette - and it has its own world-wide web server. Moreover, folks are busily sequencing not only the complete human genome but also all 100 million bases of the DNA of C. elegans.

But I digress! The point here is that C. elegans is asymmetric, and exhibits a consistent handedness. And the cool thing is that in the conference proceedings, Wood and Kevshan report on experiments where they artificially changed the handedness of C. elegans embryos when they consisted of only 6 cells! The embryos look symmetric when they have 4 cells; by the time they have 8 cells the asymmetry is marked. By moving some cells around at the 6-cell stage, Wood and Kevshan were able to create fully functional C. elegans having opposite the usual handedness.

The question of exactly how the embryo&#039;s asymmetry originates from some asymmetry at the molecular still seems shrouded in mystery. And there is another puzzle: how did the biomolecules choose their handedness in the first place? Here spontaneous symmetry breaking - an essentially random choice later amplified by selection - seems a natural hypothesis. But physicists should be interested to note that another alternative has been seriously proposed. Weak interactions violate parity and thus endow the laws of nature with an intrinsic handedness. This means there is a slight difference in energies between any biomolecule and its enantiomer, or mirror-image version. According to S. F. Mason&#039;s article in the conference proceedings, this difference indeed favors the observed forms of amino acids and sugars - the left-handed or &quot;L&quot; amino acids and the right-handed or &quot;D&quot; sugars. But the difference is is incredibly puny - typically it amounts to 10&lt;sup&gt;-14&lt;/sup&gt; joules per mole! How could such a small difference matter? Well, Kondepudi and Nelson have done calculations suggesting that in certain situations where there is both autocatalysis of both L and D forms of these molecules, and also competition between them, random fluctuations can be averaged out, while small energy level differences can make a big difference.

That would be rather satisfying to me: knowing that my heart is where it is for the same reason that neutrinos are left-handed. But in fact this theory is very controversial.... I mention it only because of its charm. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

<p>In the conference proceedings on biological asymmetry, there is an interesting article on the development of asymmetry in C. elegans. Ever since the 1960s, this little nematode has been a favorite among biologists because of its simplicity, and because of the advantages understanding one organism thoroughly rather than many organisms in a sketchy way. I&#8217;m sure most of you know about the fondness geneticists have for the fruit fly, but Caenorhabditis elegans is a far simpler critter: it only has 959 cells, all of which have been individually named and studied! There are over 1000 people studying it by now, there is a journal devoted to it &#8211; The Worm Breeder&#8217;s Gazette &#8211; and it has its own world-wide web server. Moreover, folks are busily sequencing not only the complete human genome but also all 100 million bases of the DNA of C. elegans.</p>
<p>But I digress! The point here is that C. elegans is asymmetric, and exhibits a consistent handedness. And the cool thing is that in the conference proceedings, Wood and Kevshan report on experiments where they artificially changed the handedness of C. elegans embryos when they consisted of only 6 cells! The embryos look symmetric when they have 4 cells; by the time they have 8 cells the asymmetry is marked. By moving some cells around at the 6-cell stage, Wood and Kevshan were able to create fully functional C. elegans having opposite the usual handedness.</p>
<p>The question of exactly how the embryo&#8217;s asymmetry originates from some asymmetry at the molecular still seems shrouded in mystery. And there is another puzzle: how did the biomolecules choose their handedness in the first place? Here spontaneous symmetry breaking &#8211; an essentially random choice later amplified by selection &#8211; seems a natural hypothesis. But physicists should be interested to note that another alternative has been seriously proposed. Weak interactions violate parity and thus endow the laws of nature with an intrinsic handedness. This means there is a slight difference in energies between any biomolecule and its enantiomer, or mirror-image version. According to S. F. Mason&#8217;s article in the conference proceedings, this difference indeed favors the observed forms of amino acids and sugars &#8211; the left-handed or &#8220;L&#8221; amino acids and the right-handed or &#8220;D&#8221; sugars. But the difference is is incredibly puny &#8211; typically it amounts to 10<sup>-14</sup> joules per mole! How could such a small difference matter? Well, Kondepudi and Nelson have done calculations suggesting that in certain situations where there is both autocatalysis of both L and D forms of these molecules, and also competition between them, random fluctuations can be averaged out, while small energy level differences can make a big difference.</p>
<p>That would be rather satisfying to me: knowing that my heart is where it is for the same reason that neutrinos are left-handed. But in fact this theory is very controversial&#8230;. I mention it only because of its charm.

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2017/05/02/diamondoids/#comment-90404&quot;&gt;John Baez&lt;/a&gt;.

Thank you for the explanation! I think the other question I was trying to formulate was, does chemistry distinguish a molecule from its mirror image? From the links I learned that sometimes it does, actually, and that there is a name for the two halves of such a mirror pair: &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enantiomer&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;enantiomers&lt;/a&gt;&quot;. On the other hand, enantiomers have almost identical properties, and can only be distinguished in an &quot;asymmetric environment&quot;:

When present in a symmetric environment, enantiomers have identical chemical and physical properties except for their ability to rotate plane-polarized light (+/−) by equal amounts but in opposite directions (although the polarized light can be considered an asymmetric medium).
[...]
Enantiomer members often have different chemical reactions with other enantiomer substances. Since many biological molecules are enantiomers, there is sometimes a marked difference in the effects of two enantiomers on biological organisms.

					<description><![CDATA[Can definitely see the similarities/shared symmetries with adamantine and the fundamental tetrahedronal shape of the 4 phosphorous atoms that is then expanded upon to form the entire molecule. Given that this molecule shares no atom types with that of adamantine its safe to say they share very few other properties, particularly chemical ones.

I see from Wikipedia that the crystallisation forms more into planes than a solid 3D like diamond and wonder why it seems to break its tetrahedron shape and form hexagonal &#039;rings&#039; of 6 interlinked PO4 ion shapes.
