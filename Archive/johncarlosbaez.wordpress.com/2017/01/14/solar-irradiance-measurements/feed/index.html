					<description><![CDATA[There is an update of this blog post at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.randform.org/blog/?p=7312&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;. The above curve with the subtitle: &lt;em&gt;&quot;spectral line 774.5nm from day 132 to 5073, day 132 starting Jan 24 in 2003, day 5073 is end of 2016&quot;&lt;/em&gt; looks now quite differently in the LISIRD interactive app, that is in particular the steep rise towards the end of 2016 has been &quot;corrected&quot; (I write here corrected in quotation marks, since I don&#039;t know how consciously this is seen as a correction) for a broad spectral range and in 2018 this &quot;correction&quot; results in a steep decline in irradiance rather than an expected decline due to the solar cycle. As an example the 798.83nm line (which is in the the 650–950nm range in the second circle in the above image &lt;em&gt;&quot;Difference in spectrum between day 132 and 5073&quot;&lt;/em&gt;) looks as of saturday like this:
.

I still don&#039;t know of any other satellite spectral irradiance measurements in this spectral range.
At LISIRD it is now however possible to obtain plots of the dutch &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lasp.colorado.edu/lisird/data/omi_ssi/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;OMI&lt;/a&gt; mission from 265nm to 500nm, however it stopps in April 2018.
So first here the 500.8 line from end 2016:

and how it looks now:


And here the line from OMI:

					<description><![CDATA[It is hard to say what was happening 300 million years
ago.  This study gave me some confidence in the Sun&#039;s
stability but it is a new technique and requires confirmation.
An advantage to this method is that the trees died
simultaneously so different specimens could be compared to
each other.  This has the drawback that we can not infer
much beyond the trees&#039; life span with a single sample.

The one doubt which i addressed was whether 300 million
year old fossils could be preserved well enough to extract
climate information from.  I find it amazing how well some
fossils have been preserved.  I myself have a rock with a
well preserved pollen grain that has a lot of detail
visible under the microscope.  The sample in the Geology
article is uncommonly good but it should still be possible
to repeat the study to other periods in the last few hundred
million years.  Hopefully we will get the same result for
the solar cycles&#039; length.

The Science article is also pay walled.  Here is a more
freely available subsequent article with the same authors
and the same sample as the Science article to see how well
preserved fossils from hundreds of millions years ago can be:

Well, changes depend on lifetime. As far as I can tell a lot if not most of research in which lifetime is estimated based on observation is done by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_sequence&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;comparing with other planets&lt;/a&gt;. I don&#039;t know how complex the ongoings in the sun are and what variations in lifetime may result from this.

Lisird had just updated their historical TSI (when I wrote the above the applet showed only data until 2014), so actually there it looks as if the TSI goes currently on average down since the 80s:
&lt;a href=&quot;http://lasp.colorado.edu/lisird/tsi/historical_tsi.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://lasp.colorado.edu/lisird/tsi/historical_tsi.html&lt;/a&gt;. In particular the irradiation peak in 2014 didn&#039;t extend further up. The historical data is though displayed via a model.

Lisird writes on its &lt;a href=&quot;http://lasp.colorado.edu/home/sorce/data/tsi-data/#historical_TSI&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;about page&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;These estimated solar irradiances for the last 400 years are based on the NRLTSI2 historical TSI reconstruction model by J. Lean and described by Coddington et al. The values of the NRLTSI2 model have been offset a small amount for agreement with recent SORCE/TIM values and replaced by SORCE/TIM annual averages from 2003 onward. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

As to be expected there is still a high grade of reconstruction uncertainty, i.e. it is written:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Of the NRLTSI2 and the SATIRE models, the NRLTSI2 reconstruction best matches the SORCE/TIM measurements as neither show the secular downward trend in TSI over the last three solar cycles that the SATIRE model (and thus the CMIP6) does.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;http://lasp.colorado.edu/data/sorce/total_solar_irradiance_plots/images/tim_level3_tsi_24hour_640x480.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;This plot for the January &lt;strong&gt;measurements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows though -like my calculation- rather an increasing irradiance, since 2003. But as argued already in the post it is hard to tell because e.g. the peak in 2004 (which looks lower than the one in 2015) might be only a local maximum, i.e it might have been bigger before 2003. For this case the sun cycle would have been longer than 11 ys. This actually may have been the case, since at least the &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2013/01mar_twinpeaks/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;sunspots&lt;/a&gt; apparently displayed an unusual behaviour with respect to the sun cycle.

What I find though confusing is that in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://lasp.colorado.edu/lisird/tsi/historical_tsi.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;historical reconstruction applet&lt;/a&gt; the 2004 values are very different from the 2015 values - The 2004 level is according to the applet at 1360.91 W/m^2 i.e below the 1361 level (which is roughly the &quot;middle line&quot; for that cycle) whereas 2015 is at 1361.4291, i.e. at the peak. This is in &lt;a href=&quot;http://lasp.colorado.edu/data/sorce/total_solar_irradiance_plots/images/tim_level3_tsi_24hour_640x480.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;contrast to the January measurements,&lt;/a&gt; where the 2015 peak is roughly also at 1361.5 but where the 2004 peak is only slightly lower, like roughly at 1361.2.  I find it very strange that this difference between monthly and annual values should be due to the earth orbit, but I haven&#039;t really found time to think about that thoroughly, i.e. currently I feel not able to say whether there is a bug, but I have the suspicion that there might be a bug and if it seems more likely to be found in the reconstruction applet.]]></description>

Scott Interesting, yet no one finds that 10-11 year periodicity in living tree rings, nor in coral rings.  All they see is a periodicity related to ENSO.

So what they are saying is that 290 million years ago, potentially solar periods had much greater an effect back then than they do now.  Yet you can&#039;t rule out that these ancient variations weren&#039;t also caused by an equivalent ENSO of that era, where the oceans had a different geography.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Earlier this month an article was published in the journal Geology
with interesting data on the subject from a very different point of 
view than provided by satellites.  They said:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;      &quot;This is the earliest record of sunspot cyclicity
       and simultaneously demonstrates its long-term
       stable periodicity for at least 300 m.y&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

early Permian, Geology (2017)

They used dendrochronology on 290 million year old fossil 
plants killed during a volcanic eruption.  Its amazing how well 
plant tissue can be preserved this way.  For instance the journal 
Science published an article a couple of years ago in which 
subcellular structures were visible in plant fossils:

Bomfleur et al., Fossilized Nuclei and Chromosomes Reveal 180 
Million Years of Genomic Stasis in Royal Ferns, Science 343, 1376 
(2014)

In the recent study the authors found that the length of the 
solar cycle was practically the same 290 million years ago as it is 
now.  Satellite data is great but this ancient data gives me some 
confidence that our Sun will not be undergoing rapid stellar 
evolution any time soon.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this month an article was published in the journal Geology<br />
with interesting data on the subject from a very different point of<br />
view than provided by satellites.  They said:</p>
<pre><code>      "This is the earliest record of sunspot cyclicity
       and simultaneously demonstrates its long-term
       stable periodicity for at least 300 m.y"

Sorry, but I used the NASA irradiance data you are referring to.
As written above you can find it also in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://lasp.colorado.edu/lisird/sorce/sorce_ssi/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;interactive section&lt;/a&gt;. The curves I plotted above are the same as in Nasa&#039;s interactive applet (apart from an overall scaling). Please check it, if you think something is wrong.
I checked the integrals, but of course there could still be mistakes.
So what math exactly do you think is wrong and why?]]></description>
