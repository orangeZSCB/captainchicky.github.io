					<description><![CDATA[This is my talk for the workshop &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2017/01/23/quantifying-biological-complexity/&quot;&gt;Biological Complexity: Can It Be Quantified?&lt;/a&gt;

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/bio_asu/bio_asu_web.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Biology as information dynamics&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Abstract.&lt;/b&gt; If biology is the study of self-replicating entities, and we want to understand the role of information, it makes sense to see how information theory is connected to the &#039;replicator equation&#039;&#8212;a simple model of population dynamics for self-replicating entities. The relevant concept of information turns out to be the information of one probability distribution relative to another, also known as the Kullback&#8211;Liebler divergence. Using this we can see evolution as a learning process, and give a clean general formulation of Fisher&#039;s fundamental theorem of natural selection.

As mentioned, I haven&#039;t heard any hints that any of this workshop will be made publicly available.  (Too bad---it&#039;s not so hard to make videos these days!)  But I&#039;ll make the slides of my talk available on this blog.  There&#039;s just one little problem: I have to make them first.

And before that, I have to figure out what I&#039;m going to say.  &lt;img src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/emoticons/surprised.gif&quot; /&gt;]]></description>

Elevators?  I&#039;m supposed to be careful about &lt;em&gt;elevators?&lt;/em&gt;

I recently spent a few days at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Rancho_Hotel_%26_Motel&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;El Rancho Hotel&lt;/a&gt; in Gallup, New Mexico.  My wife was investigating Navajo jewelry, which is a big thing in this town.  I was just chillin&#039;, enjoying the atmosphere.

http://route66hotels.org/wp-content/uploads/wow-slider-plugin/4/images/el_rancho_front.jpg

Big movie stars used to stay at this hotel when they were making westerns nearby.  If you read carefully, you&#039;ll see they claim to have the &#039;Charm of Yesterday, Convenience of Tomorrow&#039;.  It&#039;s one of the few places I&#039;ve been that still requires a human expert to run the elevator: an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_operator&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;elevator operator&lt;/a&gt;.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUNyhsOUliM

It made me a bit nostalgic---and made me think yet again about all the many jobs that have been eliminated by automation.

Being an elevator operator is not a job I&#039;d enjoy.  Neither is being a clerk at a grocery store.   I guess such jobs are tolerable only if there&#039;s enough pleasant social interaction with customers and coworkers.  But we don&#039;t really know what the world will be like when all such jobs are eliminated.]]></description>
