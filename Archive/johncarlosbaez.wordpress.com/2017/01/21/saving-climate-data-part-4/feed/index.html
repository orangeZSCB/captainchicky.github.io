The essential reason that ocean tides work out is that the lunar and solar cycles match the tidal cycles. There is no real magic to getting the periods to match, but the amplitudes are more difficult.

For QBO, the same argument applies.  The QBO cycles match precisely the expected lunisolar periods, but the amplitudes require some tuning.

This is a good thing because it means that another fundamental climate behavior can be understood from first principles.  This can then be used as a foundational building block to understand other climate behaviors.

The question is why Lindzen could never figure this out.]]></description>

&quot;I think of climate as being the response of the earth’s atmosphere and oceans to a forcing input. So that similar to an electrical circuit, it won’t do anything unless forced.&quot;

Well, it also does ENSO and PDO and all those other acronyms... so it depends on timescale.

The standard energy-budget treatment of the climate with its feedback sums etc results in equations that match those given for circuits.

But your circuit properties change depending on timescale, forcing (aerosol is different from CO2) and the patterns of warming you see.

Consider:
http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-12-00544.1
http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ngeo2828

You can adjust for all these things in your simple circuit-like equation with &quot;forcing efficacies&quot; and other adjustments, but that ends up looking kind of arbitrary and it&#039;s hard to work out the physical justification as to why they should be those numbers. I&#039;m sure you could get some parameterised system but I don&#039;t really see the benefits. As I understand it, tides work because you can collapse the enormous amount of information down onto relatively few EOFs.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My slant on climate data: I think of climate as being the response of the earth&#039;s atmosphere and oceans to a forcing input.   So that similar to an electrical circuit, it won&#039;t do anything unless forced. As scientists and engineers, we know enough about electricity and circuit theory to be able to predict the response of a circuit to any arbitrary input.  By that reasoning, we don&#039;t need to &lt;i&gt;archive&lt;/i&gt; all the results of various forcings to the circuits that have been created -- instead, we van always reproduce simulated responses on demand.  That&#039;s why we have simulators such as SPICE and others. So that for all the circuits ever engineered, we really don&#039;t have to archive much at all.  The same goes for other analogs, such as mechanical responses.

Yet for the earth&#039;s climate circuit, we appear to be at the primitive stages of this predictive process.  We actually &lt;i&gt;require&lt;/i&gt; massive amounts of historical data to be able to understand and place into context any new observation.  For weather, we can do a pretty good job of short-term prediction based on a combination of simulators and Bayesian reasoning. But over the long-term, our prediction abilities degrade.

However, there are certain climate phenomena -- perhaps classified more as geophysical behaviors -- that we can readily predict.  One of the more obvious of these is ocean tides. Via algorithms that often feature hundreds of parameters, we can accurately predict tidal levels at any time in the future. This is largely because we can accurately map the orbits of the earth, moon, and sun, and critical to this process know something about the physics.  Because of this knowledge, we really don&#039;t need to store huge amounts of historical data via tidal gauges (and of course we now have satellite readings). In most cases tidal predictions have become purely parametric software algorithms.

So the question is, can we do more of this kind of prediction for other climate behaviors?

I have been working on two fundamental climate phenomena -- QBO and ENSO -- and presented my own geophysical models at &lt;a href=&quot;http://contextearth.com/2016/11/21/presentation-at-agu-2016-on-december-12/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;last month&#039;s AGU meeting&lt;/a&gt;, slides &lt;a href=&quot;http://umn.edu/~puk/published/AnalyticalFormulationOfEquatorialStandingWavePhenomena2.ppsx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

The first of these two models, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasi-biennial_oscillation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;QBO of equatorial stratospheric winds&lt;/a&gt;, appears to operate similarly to ocean tides, predominantly driven by lunisolar forcings, and completely in synchronization with the Draconic or lunar tidal cycle.  The new model is deterministic and accurate enough that we literally don&#039;t require historical data  to predict future QBO cycles.   Of course the stumbling block is that the consensus theory for QBO was originally devised by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scienceblogs.com/stoat/2016/12/31/mit-climate-scientist-dr-richard-lindzen-urges-trump-cut-the-funding-of-climate-science-by-80-to-90-until-the-field-cleans-up/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Trump-like blowhard Richard Lindzen&lt;/a&gt;, who ended up leading other scientists down a path of overt complexity and non-determinism.   That&#039;s IMO of course, but I back my model up with a first-principles derivation based on Laplace&#039;s tidal equations first formulated in 1776 -- leading to a simple forcing formulation.

Take a look at my ENSO model as well,  which is related to QBO but differs in details.  These kinds of models may not necessarily replace relying on historical data, but can certainly supplement the observations.  I have no doubt that our ability to predict QBO and ENSO in future years will be as automatic as our ability to predict ocean tides.

This something to think about as we archive climate data. Trump may try to relegate all the data to the dumpster but he won&#039;t be successful in preventing scientific progress.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[John,

Thanks for all your amazing work. I especially appreciate the climate data archival project.

I&#039;ve been a student of planet earth for over 50 years. I can&#039;t help it because this is the only home I&#039;ve known. I care about what is happening to our atmosphere. The last time I checked, we only have one of those.

I&#039;m data-driven. I can&#039;t help that either. I was born that way.

To cut through the politics, the B.S. and bravado, I&#039;ve been processing weather data for the past couple of years. I&#039;m seeing some interesting patterns of change. I wanted to discover what is really going on for myself.

I write articles that nobody reads and produce interesting interactive dashboards that people can use to view the data themselves. Here is my latest article: https://3danim8.wordpress.com/2017/01/18/visualizing-observed-worldwide-air-temperature-changes/

Please keep up the fight for honesty and integrity in climate science.  I fear that we are in for a bumpy ride.
