Thanks!  That&#039;s very interesting.  It may be that DNA storage will only be good for storing large amounts of data for long periods of time, e.g. keeping a history of our civilization in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/diary/february_2008.html#february27.08&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Svalbard Global Seed Vault&lt;/a&gt;, shown here:

&#160;

&lt;img src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/diary/svalbard_seed_vault_cross-section.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Of course, for this one would need to investigate how long information stored in DNA at low temperatures can last.]]></description>

Sure can try!

The paper itself directly references the mathematical method they seem to be using and naming it after, namely fountain codes! &#039;DNA Fountain&#039; uses a Luby transform (or LT codes) which are useful for this particular type of encoding because DNA seems to be a bit lossy by nature, but you can correct for errors by using the same sort of of one-way error correction used by cell-phones and mobile TV and can reliably transmit data even when subject to erasure.

As expected, their bits are larger than the regular bit! It&#039;s actually four characters directly mapped to binary, {00,01,10,11} to {A,C,G,T} respectively. If everything were perfect, each nucleotide could theoretically hold 2 bits (4 choices) but they run into a number of limitations with biochemistry including some sorts of sequences being undesirable due to difficulty to synthesize and error proneness which reduces the actual coding potential of each nucleotide down to ~1.98 bits (through quantitative analysis), oligonucleotide synthesis (the bits of bits they&#039;re making), PCR, and even just storage results in to an overall &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon%E2%80%93Hartley_theorem&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Shannon information&lt;/a&gt; capacity of ~1.83 bits per nucleotide as their upper bound. Exploration of this seems to be one of the main points of the paper, as previous DNA storage studies only realized half of this Shannon information capacity and had issues with perfect data retrieval.

Other key points:

1) They were able to to achieve an information density of 1.57 bits/nucleotide.

2) Using their method, you can reach file sizes of up to 500Mbytes

3) They generated code that contained 72,000 oligos with a 7% redundancy, this number was chosen due to cost efficiency with the manufacturer that actually sequenced the DNA. Meaning even they don&#039;t reference how slow writing actually is, turn around could potentially be months.

4) Decoding a 2.1MB file takes them 9 minutes which makes it have a read speed of about 3.88kBps

5) The cost was $3500/Mbyte per write in this particular study. Meaning that particular file probably cost closer to $7000 to write.]]></description>

I too heard that recent news about DNA data storage, but I&#039;m always suspicious of such claims in popular media because they leave out a lot of details (like how fast the storage and retrieval are), emphasize the good news, and downplay the bad news.  Could you read the original paper and report back to us?

I&#039;m actually fascinated by this sort of thing. I&#039;ve been doing logic circuits for decades and my first question I asked my brother (who is a computer scientist by trade) is why we have to operate in binary. Found out it&#039;s because electricity just seems to work best in on or off states and bumping up the number system just increases complexities without gains.

I recently saw an article talking about the sequencing of DNA to store &lt;em&gt;tons&lt;/em&gt; of data and retrieve it without errors but the one thing no one was talking about was read/write speed. I&#039;m curious how slow it currently is, because in my head someone is sitting there with a dish and a list of letters for the years since they discovered DNA.]]></description>

I wish my work were closer to the biological ideas you&#039;re talking about!   It may take a while to get there.  There are many kinds of &#039;meaning&#039; for a chemical reaction network, and each gives a semantics that one can try to formalize.  I&#039;m just getting started on this.  Here you can see a  talk I gave on functorial semantics applied to chemical reaction networks (or actually Petri nets, which are another way of drawing the exact same information):
