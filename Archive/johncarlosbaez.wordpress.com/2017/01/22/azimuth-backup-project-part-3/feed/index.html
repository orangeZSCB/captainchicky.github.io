					<description><![CDATA[One project, called the End of Term (EOT) Presidential Harvest, was created in 2008 by the Library of Congress, the Internet Archive (also known as the Wayback Machine) and other archivists. At the end of every presidential term, the team of data specialists, professional librarians and volunteers searches and indexes all government information available, mainly at .gov or .mil websites. The 2008 and 2012 EOT efforts indexed and copied millions of webpages of government information.

The effort has heightened this year due to uncertainty about the Trump administration’s plans. Just days into the new administration, substantive changes have been made at the Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency websites. And any potential disappearance of health data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. Census Bureau or the National Institutes of Health, for example, could affect researchers at the School of Medicine and elsewhere.

Nigam Shah, MBBS, PhD, an associate professor of medicine, who specializes in analyzing biomedical data, said he knows many Stanford researchers whose work depends on government health data, including the National InPatient Sample dataset and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.

But downloading databases can be hit or miss, Jacobs said. “The internet is a messy place.” For example, the data in a database might be hidden behind search or GIS interfaces. And if those databases are taken offline, for all practical purposes, they cease to exist, Jacobs said.

For this year’s effort, 300 volunteers nationally (up from 30 in years past) have jumped in to help since mid-October, Jacobs said. The EOT team is planning to work through the end of March, so if you have a favorite database, you can still nominate it to be archived.

There are also other efforts to save government data — such as Climate Mirror, Data Refuge and the Azimuth Climate Data Backup Project.]]></description>

Okay.  Then the &#039;licensing&#039; procedure would presumably be optional,  I&#039;m all for encouraging research groups to use the data in the manner you suggest.  I don&#039;t have much of a sense of how much interested there&#039;d be in doing that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So, I have another thought on how the Azimuth Backup Archive could be used. The U. C. Irvine servers host a pretty famous &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;machine learning repository and archive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These are standard datasets for which the answers are known, used to test nascent ML algorithms and implementations.

What Azimuth Backup has can be usefully thought of as a large collection of documents. Like Amazon Cloud Drive or Google Drive (hi there @Scott Maxwell), a challenge, as I understand it, is to try to reduce storage use by detecting duplicate documents and replacing them with pointers.  I have no proprietary insight into this from either company, but I am familiar with some of the algorithms typically used for this purpose, e.g., the famous &lt;em&gt;minHash&lt;/em&gt;. Now &lt;em&gt;minHash&lt;/em&gt; is not exactly suitable because it is approximate, but there are other algorithms which are, or which, at least, do not create false positives, and no one wants to replace a document with a link to another which is not really the same.

It is probable that in our copies of datasets we have duplicates.  These may have been introduced operationally, not really knowing or having insight regarding the architecture of the many government Web sites, and with little possibility of cooperation with their operations people, but, more likely, it happens because these government sites are cross-linked in many ways, with NOAA citing things on NASA sites, NASA citing things on NOAA sites, and the Forest Service citing things on both, etc.

So, an interesting and useful additional possibility for our datasets would be to open them, on a read-only basis, to universities and courses who might want to use them as a publicly accessible &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; dataset for mining in this manner, for detecting duplicates, but possibly for other purposes. There would be no &lt;em&gt;truth data&lt;/em&gt; but, then, as in statistics projects with read datasets in advanced classes, that makes the challenge a real example of doing work in this area.

We might &quot;license&quot; the data, as U.C. Irvine does for theirs, and as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.caida.org/home/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;CAIDA does for their Internet data&lt;/a&gt;, requesting users and courses to deposit copies of papers, presentations, classwork, and publication at the site, so we develop a track record of results and how the data is being used.

Happy to discuss.]]></description>

@Brookings Library,

Actually it&#039;s not, or, at least, it has returned in some form.

Is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.doi.gov/climate&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; the same page you saw before?

I&#039;m interested in this, because it is important to have tangible (provable!) evidence of any changes being made to government climate pages, and what the changes are.]]></description>
