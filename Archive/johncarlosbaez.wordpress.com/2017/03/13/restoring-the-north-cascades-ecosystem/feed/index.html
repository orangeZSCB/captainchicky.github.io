And I forgot to add that goodweed is not very nutritious. You probably know about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_the_Great#Environment_and_agriculture&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Frederick II and the potato and other crops.&lt;/a&gt;]]></description>

Thanks Martin, I already ate it, it might be healthy but it has a very distinct taste (not really my all time favorite) and that didn&#039;t help much to reduce it. Yep one has to very carefully rip it out. It doesn&#039;t like very dry earth...which helps at least to keep it in check in some corners. I tried 20cm mulch that didn&#039;t help, it made it rather worse. 50cm mulch might makes sense for a small area, where nothing needs to grow but not between the veggies. So this sounds as if permaculture has no real good solution to goudweed.]]></description>

Just eat it :-) Seriously, it&#039;s very healthy food when young. (See caveat e.g. here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aegopodium_podagraria )
Instead of steam sterilization I would try to bury it under 50cm of mulch. Ripping out the rizomes requires care and only makes sense in very loose soil, otherwise you just multiply it.]]></description>

how do you treat goudweed among veggieplants in northern europe within this permaculture approach? Do you know?  I currently think a lot about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_steam_sterilization&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;steam sterialization.&lt;/a&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know if it is an idea inapplicable, but if it is possible to write a computer program for the approximate behaviour of the bears in the real environment (like, for example coarse geographic planimetry, prey and food, vegetation, random walk, interaction between bears, etc.) then an optimal choice for the restocking could be obtained, using multiple population dynamic (with the same initial condition, to weigh the different time evolutions and the final results).]]></description>

I don&#039;t think it&#039;s assured that &quot;later in this century and beyond, every cubic meter of the planet will be computationally accessible to surveillance and micromanagement.&quot;  I think it&#039;s also possible that civilization as we know it will collapse, and that all sorts of other things will happen.  That&#039;s one reason I want well-established wilderness areas: ecosystems of this sort are pretty good at taking care of themselves.

But in fact, natural ecosystems are so complex, so full of profound information that we&#039;re just beginning to understand, that these should &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; be preserved if our civilization goes the high-tech route.  We know far less about the design of ecosystems than nature does, and any premature attempt to replace nature with a design of our choosing is likely to fall on its face.  Vegetarian wildcats and deer that don&#039;t need to run are good examples of things that won&#039;t work well for long.]]></description>

I completely agree with you about the need for extreme caution. But later this century and beyond, every cubic meter of the planet will be computationally accessible to surveillance and micromanagement. Do we want a living world where sentient beings harm each other or not? Ultimately the level of suffering in the post-CRISPR biosphere is an ethical question. If intelligent moral agents opt for a living world without starvation and predators, we&#039;re not going to run out of computational resources.]]></description>
