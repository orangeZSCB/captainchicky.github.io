I&#039;ll take a look at that paper on the arXiv.  I notice that it mentions M-theory and 11d spacetime.   This makes me wonder, quite idly, whether you could find an interesting model where instead of the 600-cell you used the $latex \mathrm{E}_7$ root polytope in 7 dimensions, the $latex \mathrm{E}_8$ root polytope in 8 dimensions, or something like that.  These have even more symmetries than the 600-cell!  For example, the $latex \mathrm{E}_8$ root polytope has 696729600 symmetries.  On top of that, the 240 vertices of this polytope &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.ams.org/visualinsight/2015/01/01/icosidodecahedron-from-projected-d6-root-polytope/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;correspond in a very sneaky way to two copies of the 600-cell&#039;s 120 vertices&lt;/a&gt;.

But, I don&#039;t have any concrete ideas of how you&#039;d get a higher-dimensional field theory and discretize space to be one of these delightful higher-dimensional polytopes.]]></description>

Hi, the BMN model can be found here:  https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0202021

It was all the rage when I was about to graduate from Berkeley.  All the stringers were talking about it.  It provided a further evidence and elaboration of the holographic correspondence.

It would be interesting to compute quantities in the gauge theory from a nonperturbative, numerical approach, which is why a few of us in the lattice community are interested in it.  Of course, we&#039;re also looking for excuses to work with curved spaces.]]></description>

Neat!  It would be nice if starting with the vertex quandle you could &lt;em&gt;build&lt;/em&gt; the edge and face quandles by some systematic construction, in a way that works for all 3-dot Coxeter diagrams.  (And similarly for Coxeter diagrams with more dots.)]]></description>

Cool!  I like the idea of the 600-cell as an approximation to $latex \mathrm{S}^3.$  I don&#039;t know about the BMN model.

(By the way, you were using &#036;\latex instead of &#036;latex to begin your math comments, so I fixed that.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[John, We are also quite obsessed with the 600 cell.  For one thing, the corresponding discrete Laplacian (nearest neighbors only) has an amazing amount of symmetry, and a lot of properties for the spectrum that resembles the continuum on $latex S^3$.  Many field theories on $latex S^3$ are of interest to me, but especially the BMN model, which is essentially N=4 super-Yang-Mills compactified on $latex \mathbb{R} \times S^3$.]]></description>
