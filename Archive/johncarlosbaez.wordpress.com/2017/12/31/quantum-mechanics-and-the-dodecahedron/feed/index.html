					<description><![CDATA[We could also define A5 as the group of rotations which fix the following degree-6 polynomial (x − φy)(y − φz)(z − φx)(x + φy)(y + φz)(z + φx), which is isomorphic to Greg Egan’s potential function discussed here. This is mildly (but not precisely*) analogous to the description of the Monster as the automorphisms of the Griess algebra. Note that the polynomial is clearly invariant under the monomial subgroup A4, and with some effort can be shown to be invariant under the full group A5.]]></description>

This a very good idea, I am sure it will help attracting more interest from people with knowledge on spectroscopy!]]></description>

The paper tries to push quantum computing in the direction of rotational state spaces, which have been thoroughly studied in spectroscopy. I try to include all the jargon for the groups in the text to make it easier ($latex Z_3 = C_3$ and $latex $C_\infty = SO(2)=U(1)$).]]></description>

Thanks for the interest! The math-related part is Appx. D. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s at all surprising one can formulate a &quot;grand orthogonality theorem&quot; for coset spaces, but I&#039;ve never seen it explicitly written either. If you&#039;re interested in the quantum aspects, feel free to read my blog post: https://quantumfrontiers.com/2019/11/17/on-the-coattails-of-quantum-supremacy/]]></description>

Interesting (and long) paper! Never got in touch with quantum computing before but to me it seems to be closely related to microwave spectroscopy and theoretical chemistry, though the language is a physics/maths one ($latex Z_3$ versus $latex C_{3v}$, ...).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this post; it helped me with my work, which I was looking forward to sharing here. We develop quantum error-correcting codes for the rigid rotor and its relatives. H-symmetric harmonics are one of our tools, and we obtain them by symmetrizing the ordinary harmonics (be it for $latex \mathrm{SO}_3$ or the two-sphere) over the group H. I&#039;m sure this isn&#039;t new, but haven&#039;t quite seen it spelled out the same way. We also formulate a &quot;coordinates statement&quot; of Peter-Weyl on homogeneous spaces. I would be interested in comments and any refs I missed! https://scirate.com/arxiv/1911.00099]]></description>

So, there&#039;s a lot of serious math under the hood.
