Then, what should be the motivation for a Nambu formulation of (generalized) thermodynamics, if any, as some research papers about black holes do indeed? Further symmetries?]]></description>

When we go to more variables in thermodynamics we still get a cotangent bundle equipped with the usual 2-form, which is a symplectic structure, and the submanifold of thermodynamic states is a Lagrangian submanifold.   This is sort of &#039;well-known&#039;, though people often phrase the idea using contact geometry instead of symplectic geometry, and it&#039;s not incredibly easy to find a clear account of all this.   You can read a tiny bit more about near the very end here:

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/classical_vs_thermo/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Classical mechanics versus thermodynamics&lt;/a&gt;.

where I discuss the case where we keep track of particle number (for just one kind of particle) and the chemical potential.   Near the end here:

I describe the math in the general case, but not specific examples from thermodynamics.]]></description>

Yes Tony, I realized I wrote the WRONG variable in the 2-form, but I can not edit my posts here :(. My mistake...
With respect to n-ary Thermodynamics I was watching some papers yesterday about geometric thermodynamics in black holes and/or fluid dynamics in which there are some Nambu formulations! However, I am not sure I understand the formulation of Nambu dynamics and the fundamental identity when quantized. If my memory doesn&#039;t fail, there are some algebras by Filipov (or a guy with similar name) which studied n-ary algebras in Nambu-like style, but I have not read Nambu dynamics papers for a while. Perhaps, it&#039;s time to read about Nambu mechanics again. Even more, I found out that there is a dissipative version of classical mechanics combining the metric and a Poisson bracket structure, something called metriplectic dynamics. I am not sure of what is the capability of that mechanics but I will also reseach on it...]]></description>

In the simple case considered in this article, we don&amp;apos;t have $latex \mathrm d p \wedge \mathrm d T$ or $latex \mathrm d V \wedge \mathrm d S$; we have $latex \mathrm d T \wedge \mathrm d S$ and $latex \mathrm d p \wedge \mathrm d V$ (added together with a minus sign).  So this just looks like moving from $latex 2$ variables to $latex n$ variables but still with a $latex 2$-form: $latex \omega = \mathrm d T \wedge \mathrm d S - \mathrm d p \wedge \mathrm d V - \mathrm d \mu \wedge \mathrm d N - \sum_i \mathrm d \lambda_i \wedge \mathrm d Q_i$.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The intuitive argument in favor of Nambu-like dynamics is the presence of a chemical potentiatl and other charges/potentials in the first principle, e.g.:
$latex dU=pdV-TdS+\mu dN$ or $latex dU=pdV-TdS+\mu dN+\sum_i \lambda_idQ_i$. Then, one would expect something like 
$latex \omega = dp\wedge dT\wedge d\mu \wedge d\lambda_i$ and its dual form $latex \overline{\omega}=dV\wedge dS\wedge dN\wedge dQ_i$ to be invariant forms similar to the 2-form in common thermodynamics. What do you think?]]></description>

Well, obviously as a physicist myself I would say...At least longer than the lifetime of the proton! 
By the way, do you think a 3-variable or n-variable Poisson-like variant (maybe Nambu mechanics) could be possible? As an undergraduated, when reading about Nambu mechanics in the library, I wondered if someone had considered something like $latex dx\wedge dp\wedge dF$ and a generalized thermodynamics using 3-forms or n-forms. Another issue I wondered in those times was if there is any other form of thermodynamics possible (now I know the answer is yes, as there is Tsallis, Renyi and other types of thermostatistics!). Do you know if there is any about that? Blender and Nevir just formulated fluid dynamics using a Nambu form. And I think another guy even formulated electromagnetism as a Nambu-type fluid! I google it and checked it in my database of articles: https://www.academia.edu/37174521/Nambu_brackets_for_the_electromagnetic_field Worth reading yet! If any reader knows about any other n-ary works about fluid thermodynamics or alike I would be pleased to read them all.]]></description>

Thanks.  Yes, one can find the potentials this way.   In this series of posts I was heading toward a proof of Maxwell&#039;s relations that doesn&#039;t involve these potentials, so I was emphasizing---a bit unfairly---how annoying they can be.   But they are interesting and important in their own right, along with the theory of Legendre transforms.]]></description>
