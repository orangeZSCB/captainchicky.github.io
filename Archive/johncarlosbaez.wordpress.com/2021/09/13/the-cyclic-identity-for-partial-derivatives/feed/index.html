Oh, sorry---for some silly reason I thought you were using &quot;intuition&quot; in the derogatory sense, like &quot;lack of rigor&quot;.    Of course one wants a rigorous proof that also provides a good intuition for why the result is true!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The functional dependence among $latex u$, $latex v$ and $latex w$ defines a surface. The normal direction to the surface is given by the gradients $latex (-1,\frac{\partial u}{\partial v},\frac{\partial u}{\partial w})$ or $latex (\frac{\partial v}{\partial u},-1,\frac{\partial v}{\partial w})$. Since these must be parallel we have $latex \left&#124; \begin{array}{cc} -1 &#038; \frac{\partial u}{\partial v} \\ \frac{\partial v}{\partial u} &#038; -1 \end{array} \right&#124;=0$ and $latex \left&#124; \begin{array}{cc} \frac{\partial u}{\partial v} &#038; \frac{\partial u}{\partial w}\\ -1 &#038; \frac{\partial v}{\partial w} \end{array} \right&#124;=0$. The first is satisfied trivially, while the second, upon multiplication by $latex \frac{\partial w}{\partial u}$ yields the required the identity. The geometric intuition is that however we look at the surface the normal direction is the same.]]></description>

Thanks.  Neither my proof nor Jules Jacobs&#039; nor the argument in the video used &#039;intuition&#039;, though my quick proof sketch didn&#039;t fill in the details of every step, e.g. justifying that you can work to first order at a point.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Here is another proof using forms; no intuition, just algebra.
$latex du = \frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{v}}dv + \frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{w}}dw,$
$latex dv = \frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{u}}du + \frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{w}}dw,$
$latex dw = \frac{\partial{w}}{\partial{u}}du + \frac{\partial{w}}{\partial{v}}dv.$
Wedge the first two equations with each other and use the third to replace $latex dw$ in the right-hand side. Taking into account $latex du \wedge du = 0$ and $latex dv \wedge dv = 0$, we find
$latex du \wedge dv = \frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{v}}\frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{u}}dv \wedge du + \frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{v}}\frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{w}}\frac{\partial{w}}{\partial{u}}dv \wedge du + \frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{u}}\frac{\partial{w}}{\partial{v}}\frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{w}}dv \wedge du.$ But $latex \frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{v}}\frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{u}} = 1$ and $latex a:=\frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{v}}\frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{w}}\frac{\partial{w}}{\partial{u}}=\frac{1}{\frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{u}}\frac{\partial{w}}{\partial{v}}\frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{w}}}$, so we get $latex 2du \wedge dv = (a +\frac{1}{a})dv \wedge du$, whence $latex a = -1$.]]></description>

There is a not-so-well-known book by Michael Spivak that is worth mentioning:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=michael+spivak+physics+for+mathematicians&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Physics for Mathematicians: Mechanics I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Concerning that book, Spivak&#039;s friend, mentor, and colleague Richard S. Palais &lt;a href=&quot;https://mathoverflow.net/questions/51395/a-soft-introduction-to-physics-for-mathematicians-who-dont-know-the-first-thing#comment127660_51414&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I would like to give a strong second to this recommendation. I do have a copy and have been reading and liking it. And let me add that it contains tons of fascinating historical etc. material. While not everything that I know about is done just as I would have presented it, as anyone who knows Spivak&#039;s other famous books would expect, the presentation is exceptionally clear and readable. I saw Spivak [born 1940] at the New Orleans Joint Annual Meeting this weekend [in 2011] and he told me that electricity and magnetism is next---but don&#039;t hold your breath, he said the Mechanics volume took 6 yrs of very hard work. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

After extensive and thorough coverage of hidden assumptions in the subject, Spivak moves forward to a treatment of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, relying on his books on DG.]]></description>

Like John, I also took multivariable calculus at my local university while I was in high school.  I don&amp;apos;t remember who the author of the textbook was, but I don&amp;apos;t think that it was substantially different from the textbooks in common use at state universities in the USA today.  I really learnt the subject the next year, reading Spivak&amp;apos;s Calculus on Manifolds in the university&amp;apos;s library.  (First I read his regular calculus textbook, then Calculus on Manifolds, then his 5-volume magnum opus on differential geometry, although I didn&amp;apos;t finish the last or understand all of what I did read of it.)

As for what I use, I teach this course at my local community college, from an ordinary textbook that we get from our contracted publisher, along with course notes that I&amp;apos;ve written that look a bit more under the hood.  You can find the latter at http://tobybartels.name/MATH-2080/2021FA/ (or start at http://tobybartels.name/MATH-2080/ for a more up-to-date version if you&amp;apos;re reading this in 2022 or later).]]></description>

Well, that&#039;s certainly interesting. Thanks for explaining that. I had wondered why you so often discussed learning math from physics texts.

BTW, texts at one time popular for some approximation to that course were:
1957 Apostol, &lt;i&gt;Mathematical Analysis&lt;/i&gt;
1959 Nickerson, Spencer, and Steenrod, &lt;i&gt;Advanced Calculus&lt;/i&gt; (Princeton Math 303-304)
1965 Fleming, &lt;i&gt;Functions of Several Variables&lt;/i&gt;
(1965 Spivak, &lt;i&gt;Calculus on Manifolds&lt;/i&gt; (very concise notes))
1968 Loomis &#038; Sternberg, &lt;i&gt;Advanced Calculus&lt;/i&gt; (Harvard Math 55)
1968 Lang, &lt;i&gt;Analysis I&lt;/i&gt;, 1983, 1997 &lt;i&gt;Undergraduate Analysis&lt;/i&gt;

Just thought I&#039;d mention those texts in case anyone cares to opine on them.
(I wonder what text Toby uses.)

Re Feynman, let me put in a plug for a most excellent, and free!!, on-line version of his lectures:

					<description><![CDATA[John, you were an undergrad at Princeton.
Who taught your Advanced Calculus, or whatever the multi-variable calculus course was called, and what textbook did they use?
(Nickerson, Spencer, and Steenrod?)
Another popular text back then was Tom Apostol, &lt;i&gt;Mathematical Analysis: A Modern [for 1957!] Approach to Advanced Calculus&lt;/i&gt;.
Anyhow, thanks very much for your illuminating discussion of this situation!]]></description>
