I didn&#039;t know graded Lie algebas had a convoluted history!  I don&#039;t know anything about their history.

By the way, sorry for not writing some more blog posts on aether theories.  I wanted to write about Cauchy&#039;s three aether theories, but I got distracted.  I should do it!   Most people who make fun of old aether theories  don&#039;t know Cauchy had three of them.]]></description>

Hmm, I hadn&#039;t noticed it.  I&#039;m gonna get rid of that.   There is no good reason to expect some nontrivial charge distribution in the neutrino.  There are &#039;preon&#039; theories where existing elementary particles are actually made of &#039;preons&#039;.  I don&#039;t know if in some of those theories the neutrino is made of charged particles.  But even if so, that&#039;s not what a Wikipedia article should be talking about at the start of an article about muon neutrinos!

So, I&#039;ll delete this word &quot;net&quot; from the Wikipedia article.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m curious why the Wikipedia article uses the term &quot;net&quot; electric charge. Do they anticipate some non-trivial charge distribution inside a neutrino?]]></description>
