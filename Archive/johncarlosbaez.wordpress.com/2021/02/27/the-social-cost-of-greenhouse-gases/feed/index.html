					<description><![CDATA[As a pedestrian (don&#039;t own a car and now not a useful bike---i loaned my good one to someone and never got it back) in an urban area i sort of enjoyed the few weeks when there was basically a 100% COVID lockdown---almost no cars on the streets  and i live near 2 major  suburb-to--city commuting routes.

It&#039;s not uncommon for pedestrians and bikers to get hit by cars (to the extent that the city changed laws last year---lowered speed limits, made some car turns illegal , added crosswalk zones , etc.)

There was a noticeable difference in air quality and &#039;noise pollution&#039;.

Only problem with the &#039;lockdown&#039; was there was more street crime---only people on the street were people like me who refuse to stay inside and &#039;roving criminals&#039; (a few of whom i (unfortunately) met).

Also you couldn&#039;t even sit in the local developed parks---i go to a couple to read outside---sit on a bench---these were closed and patrolled by police.   The &#039;undeveloped&#039; and much larger park (rock creek) was open but is further away.

Although there are not a lot of small businesses around here, of the few that are here about half closed down and haven&#039;t come back.  These places were operating on a day to day level.   (Only one did i patronize---i could read there--sort of like a cafe.  The problem with that was i had to negotiate the &#039;corner&#039; up the street.    Its a street hangout.)

When i was living in the country my grandmother gave me her old car which i never used--didn&#039;t have a license , didn&#039;t want to pay for gas or insurance, had almost zero income  (about 100$/month) but low expenses (no phone/internet---i had to walk/bike  3 miles for phone, and another 8 miles over 2 small mountains for library internet).   I could handle it without a problem.   One of my relatives took the car---it was in an old barn.

I sort of wish i had that car.  Some people I know are much healthier than me now.    They don&#039;t have to worry about street crime nor have to do the same little walks in the park next to the polluted creek everyday if if you even take a walk. They just hop in their car, drive a few hours and go up into the mountains.     Get a very inspirational walk. (Only streets may have traffic.)

They are also more productive from a standard economics view.e.g. they are science journalists, teachers at expensive private schools, etc  One even has free &#039;bus service to work&#039;---&#039;ride sharing;&#039;--but prefers to drive.  The &#039;social cost of carbon&#039;  has to do both with CO2 and its affect on your lifestyle and schedule

(I can even understand why wealthy people buy a private plane.)

I was living in  the country when 9/11 happened  --the one thing i had was a radio.  I was about to go up the mountain when  i heard about it on the morning news. I listened for an hour or two, decided there was nothing i could do, didn&#039;t really understand what was going on, and then went up the mountain as usual--a couple miles.

While planes are &#039;intermittent&#039; in that area (probably something like a poisson distribution) i noticed for like the week there wasn&#039;t a plane in the sky.

It was very quiet except for the wildlife---you can hear the planes and see the chemtrails.  Chemtrails are interesting patterns in the sky--though pollution---but plane noise even if they are 29,9999 feet up is unpleasant.  (i once took a plane to hawaii and flew directly over where i used to live ---i could see it out the window.  i sort of wished they would just drop me off--i was sure the plane would crash due to turbulence--but it didn&#039;t.  Hawaii has much (a lot) more difficult mountains than my area. on a map they look similar, in practice they aren&#039;&#039;t.)]]></description>

Also see this blog article and the comments, on the assumptions underlying the whole idea of exponential discounting:

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2020/10/25/exponential-discounting/&quot;&gt;Exponential discounting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Azimuth&lt;/i&gt;, 25 October 2020.

And for an alternative to exponential discounting:

&#8226; Wikipedia, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_discounting&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Hyperbolic discounting&lt;/a&gt;.

if we dig deep enough we&#039;ll probably find exponential discounting is not appropriate for problems so big they threaten to undermine civilization itself.  But it&#039;s hard enough to get people to take climate change seriously, much less rethink the foundations of economics.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Azimuth Project has had a deep discussion, to my recollection, of the matter of what&#039;s pertinent in terms of discount rates.  Some lauded economists doubt that the traditional formulations are appropriate for evaluating both costs of climate disruption and the costs of, say, converting the world&#039;s energy systems to help mitigate these changes.  I&#039;m not providing references here, but the former are  bigger under this discussion, and the latter are lower.
