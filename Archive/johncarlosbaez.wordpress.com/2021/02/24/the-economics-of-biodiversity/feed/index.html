					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2021/02/24/the-economics-of-biodiversity/#comment-169573&quot;&gt;cgopaul&lt;/a&gt;.

I would like to use math to shed some new light on biology, ecosystems, biodiversity... and yes, the economics of biodiversity.   It&#039;s been going rather slowly so far.   One reason is that I need to learn a lot of stuff.  Another is that I&#039;m doing too many different things.   Another reason might be that this task is intrinsically difficult.  But I&#039;m pretty optimistic that if people keep pushing in this direction, some nice things will emerge.

Right now I&#039;m working with Evan Patterson, James Fairbanks, Owen Lynch and Christian Williams on applications of Petri nets and statistics to biochemistry.    I have a half-finished paper with Jonathan Lorand about open Petri nets and chemical reaction networks.  With luck I&#039;ll spend July at the brand-new &lt;a href=&quot;https://topos.institute/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Topos Institute&lt;/a&gt; talking to people about related ideas.

I never finished my series of posts on &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2020/10/08/fishers-fundamental-theorem-part-3/&quot;&gt;Fisher&#039;s fundamental theorem&lt;/a&gt;, but this is another thing I want to keep working on.  This another side of the same set of ideas, since like chemistry, evolutionary game theory can to some extent be formalized using Petri nets and concepts such as entropy and free energy.  At least, there&#039;s enough overlap that there&#039;s some real math to do in the intersection!   And, one nice thing is that evolutionary game theory moves in the direction of economics.

Actual economics is a lot harder for me.   I think it&#039;s crucial to change how we think about economics to do well in the Anthropocene.  But it&#039;s not an easy subject and I&#039;m far from an expert!   I&#039;ve been asked to give a talk about economics at the still-nascent DeMoS Institute, and I hope that forces me to crystallize some of my thoughts.  But it will take a while.

(You can&#039;t read about the DeMoS Institute anywhere, and I won&#039;t say anything about it until the organizer gives me the go-ahead.  But it&#039;s interesting that a number of young mathematicians are trying to set up institutes aimed at helping solve big real-word problems.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The feb 29 2016 Azimuth blog  post &#039;price of everything&#039; overlaps with this;  a july 2020 article in Sustainability  by N Ashford (MIT business school)    on inequality, sustainability and COVID  has a list of well known &#039;solutions&#039; to these problems.

Dasgupta&#039;s article has been discussed on &#039;degrowth&#039; blogs (a sort of French term  (&#039;decroisssance&#039;) for achieving a &#039;stready state economy&#039;--though ;&#039;degrowethers&#039; and &#039;steady staters&#039; spend alot of time debtaing which terms is better; many mainstream envoironemtalists  and ecologists stay out iof these debates.   .

The Dasgupta article is good,but way too detailed for most people I think.  The basic logic (summarized in a few simple equations) is buried in the text . --they are simple accounting identities.

An older book by Dasgupta    (and an overlapping one by Amartya Sen) sort of went through the biodiversity --or diversity in general arguments.

Dasgupta pointed out for the case of India people&#039;s productivity decreases if they don&#039;t have enough to eat. This is one reason despite havig large populations, rural areas of India often   don&#039;t get alot done.   (I&#039;ve been to India once, and remember seeing very slender people who would sit and break rocks with hammers to build a road).

The biodiviersity argument is sort iof like saying a wilderderness area with rare species which may only be of economic value for  for tourism, ecological research, and possibly &#039;ecosystem services&#039; (flood and fire prevention, fisheries, maybe clean air, and reserves of genetic diversity that maybe useful to have around)  has a divfferent value than if the area was converted to  a corn farm and cattle feed lot---the corn is used for cattle feed, and to make corn oil/syrup/fructose used in sodas and canned food (wjhioch sometimes lead to healthb problems--they say health care is 18%  of US GDP and alot of that is for preventible diseases and due to other social problems. )

(This topic is one i&#039;ve been studying a long time  --how do you place a vlaue on something not composed of one thing.  Its like a &#039;recipe&#039; --you want the optimal combination of ingrediants.   Also people prefer different recipes--so you need an optimal combination of optimal combinations.       I haven&#039;t been able to find any academic environment  where i could study this kind of problem applied to socio-economic-ecological problems  *though conceptuaklly similar ones exist through science, especially machine learning / data  science but those approaches are ones which basically   major elements of the &#039;recipes&#039; i like.  .]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If I may ask a naive question, do you think this perspective of economics can be better modelled with the tools of category theory or petri nets? You have over the last decade described both as having use in understanding systems and processes made of parts. It seems natural assets and their interrelationships are quite complex things with lots of different kinds of overlaps and feedback and this may benefit from a more precise mathematical approach, one a bit different to his impact equation, though similar in spirit. Does any of that make any sense to you, given your knowledge in those areas?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2021/02/24/the-economics-of-biodiversity/#comment-169560&quot;&gt;rubennelson&lt;/a&gt;.

As one ventures farther and farther from our &quot;modern techno-industrial frames of reference&quot;, fewer and fewer people with economic power will pay attention... because the conclusions will tend to undermine their power and even their sense of self-worth.  So, it&#039;s important to have people thinking about these issues in a whole continuum of ways.

From my reading so far, it looks like Dasgupta is taking an approach based on &quot;asset management&quot;, which is quite traditional in many ways, but he&#039;s expanding the scope of what counts as &quot;assets&quot;.  If people really acted on this, their behavior would change quite dramatically.

He talks about how education can help people make this shift.  Education is probably necessary.  And yet, this shift doesn&#039;t require a complete change of worldview.   So, it might catch on fairly soon.  Other more dramatic changes in attitude may only catch on after a crisis forces a more serious rethink.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The best part of this report is that it was done at all.  It is a glimmer of hope that serious folks in the financial world are noodling the thought that an economics that has no useful information about the living systems which we depend on, at best is useless, at worst is dangerous. Sadly, much of it runs downhill from there.  The report still assumes the enduring validity of our Modern Techno-industrial frames of reference which economics reflects.  The report  shows no sophistication in the work of seeing, understanding, and responding to the realities of complex living biological systems as complex living systems.  Oh my..  i hope they do not think they are finished with this work because in their own minds they have done such a fine job.  Rather, this is just a beginning effort. as with many 1st year efforts it gets a C for effort.]]></description>
