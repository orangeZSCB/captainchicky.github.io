While one can discuss how to best spend a finite amount of money, I’m reminded of something which Robert Pirsig wrote: The television scientist who says „Our experiment is a failure; we didn‘t find what we were expecting“ is suffering mainly from a bad scriptwriter.  If you know what you will find, there is little need to do the experiment.  General-purpose machines are very important.  Many interesting things have been found by such things which were not even though of when they were built, much less used to justify the funding.]]></description>

Sabine Hossenfelder&#039;s video “Particle Physicists Continue Empty Promises” linked to above appeared on 2020-10-22.
It appeared in a certain context, explained in a 2020-07-02 article 
&quot;Europeans Decide on Particle Strategy&quot;
https://physics.aps.org/articles/v13/105

From the physics.org article:

“CERN needs to have a project for after the LHC,” says Halina Abramowicz, chair of the European Strategy Group, from Tel Aviv University in Israel.

The main objective of any post-LHC endeavor will be to look for new particles or phenomena that go beyond the standard model of particle physics. 
Physicists are still in the dark as to what this “new physics” will be, so the best way forward is to study the Higgs boson with greater precision, Abramowicz says. 
The Higgs is unique in that it should interact with all particles, even ones that physicists haven’t detected yet. 
“The Higgs does not differentiate: if there is something out there, it will couple to it,” Abramowicz explains.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am thinking that in the nucleus the u-d quark bond could exist, like in the Kekulé structure with a linear combination of nuclear wavefuction.
For example there are excited state for the neutron, and proton, where the quarks are aligned in delta barions

https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Qualitative-picture-of-the-neutron-left-and-0-right-charge-distributions-in-the_fig2_2173550

so that a quark in the neutron could exchange a pion to change d -&#062;u in a proton and it seem work.
The deuterium could be formed by a neutron n(d-u-d) and a delta(u-d-u) baryon with three interaction in the linear configuration of quark: the energy of the neutron and delta is 939.6+1232=2171.6 Mev, the energy of the neutron and proton is 939.6+9383=1877.9 Mev, so that the three bonds have an energy of 97,9 Mev.
This could be true for the tritium, using three linear quark configuration 2n(d-u-d) delta(u-d-u) with six possible bonds. The energy of the 2n+delta is 2&lt;em&gt;939.6+1232=3111,2Mev, the tritium energy is 3,0160492&lt;/em&gt;931,494102=2809,5Mev so that the total energy of the bonds is 301.7Mev, the energy  of a single bond is 301.7/3=100,6Mev (the pion interaction change the quark type, so that there can be only one interaction between nucleons at a time).
The alpha particle is 2n(d-u-d) e 2p(u-d-u), if there is an interaction between linear conformation of quarks then 2n(d-u-d) interact with 2delta(u-d-u), the alpha energy is 3727.4 Mev, the energy of the nucleons and barions is 2&lt;em&gt;’939,6+2&lt;/em&gt;1232=4343.2Mev, so that the difference in energy is 615,8 Mev and the energy of a single bond is 615.8/6 = 104.8 Mev.
Now I am evaluating the energy of the bounds of nucleon in the triangular conformation (delta barions with triangular configuration of quarks and protons) to obtain a magical number using an octahedron with two  quark in each vertex; if everything work the magical number could be a geometric result.]]></description>

Any thoughts?  She has some good points, but throws the baby out with the bathwater.  Also, sometimes I get the impression that she thinks that since she has written a paper on something, or even just mentioned it in a blog, then the case must be closed.

I reviewed her Lost in Math book as a guest post on her blog, which she was kind enough to allow even though the review was not wholly positive.  There, my criticism is that she misunderstands much of the discussion about fine-tuning in physics.  My next paper, almost ready to go, will deal with that.  (First things first; I’ve had 5 single-author papers accepted in the last 13 months, even though until the end of December 2020 I had been working full-time outside of academia.)]]></description>

I have a lot of thoughts on this.   To a zeroth approximation I agree with Sabine.   After I quit work on quantum gravity I wrote this:

					<description><![CDATA[Some of my remarks about the Hoyle state were wrong, and I fixed them.  Here&#039;s the fixed version, in case you already read this article:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Hoyle state has energy 7.65 MeV more than the lowest-energy state of &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C.  To get a feeling for how much that is, it helps to know that when a &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C is in its lowest-energy state---called its &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_state&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;ground state&lt;/a&gt;---its energy is 11,177.93 MeV.   So, the Hoyle state has just a tiny bit more energy than the ground state.

But here&#039;s a better way to think about it.  The ground state energy of &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C is 7.27 MeV less than that of 3 alpha particles.   So, the Hoyle state of &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C has
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
7.65 MeV - 7.27 MeV = 0.38 MeV&lt;/div&gt;
more energy than 3 alpha particles.  This means that carbon in its Hoyle state can break apart into 3 alpha particles!  It can also decay back to the ground state of &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C.  But it&#039;s not a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bound_state&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;bound state&lt;/a&gt;---it&#039;s not held together, it can fall apart into alpha particles.

But here&#039;s the really interesting thing about the energy of the Hoyle state: it&#039;s almost the same as the energy of a beryllium nucleus plus an alpha particle!   An ordinary beryllium nucleus, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beryllium-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;Be&lt;/a&gt;, is made of 4 protons and 4 neutrons.  Thus, it can be made from 2 alpha particles.  &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C, as we&#039;ve seen, can be made from 3.  But the rest energy of &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;Be plus that of an alpha particle exceeds that of &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C, thanks to binding energy.  In fact, that sum is closer to the energy of the Hoyle state!

Let&#039;s see how it works.   The ground state energy of &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;Be is 7456.89 MeV.  The ground state energy of an alpha particle is 3727.38 MeV.  Summing them up, we get
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
7456.89 MeV + 3727.38 MeV =  11184.27 MeV&lt;/div&gt;
This is more than the ground state energy of &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C, which---I said a while back---is 11,177.93 MeV.  How much more?
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
11184.27 MeV - 11,177.93 MeV = 6.34 MeV&lt;/div&gt;
On the other hand, we&#039;ve seen the energy of the Hoyle state is 7.64 MeV more than that of &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C.  These numbers are pretty close.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;I’ve had to watch seemingly intelligent scientists cling to these recent theories despite their lack of success.&quot;

Can&#039;t resist providing a link to Sabine Hossenfelder&#039;s video &quot;Particle Physicists Continue Empty Promises&quot;:
https://youtu.be/9qqEU1Q-gYE
She recalls some of the claims made for what various expensive projects would reveal about nature,  and suggests advocates for these projects over-promised and under-delivered.   Any thoughts on the issues she raises?

In the same vein, I would ask just what we get for the $40G/year that goes to the NIH.

As for me, I just wish the six parts of the wish list of the fusion researchers, helpfully listed here:
https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/12/us-physicists-rally-around-ambitious-plan-build-fusion-power-plant 
could be fully funded. There are so many unknowns WRT making nuclear fusion power generation possible, it&#039;s absolutely imperative we start reducing the unknowns. So many unknowns about what will actually happen in ITER when they finally turn it on.  And that will take some serious govt funding.]]></description>

<iframe class="youtube-player" width="450" height="254" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9qqEU1Q-gYE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe><br />
She recalls some of the claims made for what various expensive projects would reveal about nature,  and suggests advocates for these projects over-promised and under-delivered.   Any thoughts on the issues she raises?</p>
<p>In the same vein, I would ask just what we get for the $40G/year that goes to the NIH.</p>
<p>As for me, I just wish the six parts of the wish list of the fusion researchers, helpfully listed here:<br />
<a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/12/us-physicists-rally-around-ambitious-plan-build-fusion-power-plant" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/12/us-physicists-rally-around-ambitious-plan-build-fusion-power-plant</a><br />
could be fully funded. There are so many unknowns WRT making nuclear fusion power generation possible, it&#8217;s absolutely imperative we start reducing the unknowns. So many unknowns about what will actually happen in ITER when they finally turn it on.  And that will take some serious govt funding.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Another twist to the carbon story. Until relatively recently, the half-life of carbon-14 was anomalous from a theoretical point of view. It is many orders of magnitude larger than both the half-lives of isotopes of other light elements undergoing the same decay process, and what standard calculations for nucleon-nucleon interactions in Gamow-Teller beta decay would indicate. In 2011, Maris et al. showed for the first time, with the aid of a supercomputer, that allowing for nucleon-nucleon-nucleon interactions in a dynamical no-core shell model of beta decay explains the long lifetime of carbon-14. Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 202502 (2011).]]></description>
