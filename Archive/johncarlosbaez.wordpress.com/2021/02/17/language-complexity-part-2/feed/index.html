					<description><![CDATA[I agree with Boris. This is not the &#039;formal idea of a language&#039; but the &#039;idea of a formal language&#039;. But even formal languages can have important context sensitivities above the sentence level. For example many languages are extensible using definitions, so sentences in the scope of the definition may be non-sentences elsewhere.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello... While I understand you aren&#039;t meaning to discuss natural languages, I can&#039;t help relating the above to classical Chomsky and how he assumed that are decoupled the learning of natural language vocabulary from that of natural language grammar, to then describe the latter as a complexity mystery in want of an autonomous resolution.

The most direct objection to this classical Chomsky view is to point out that natural grammars and languages continuously evolve, what&#039;s denied when painting languages as timeless sets of potential utterances. In line with your definition here.

(or timeless sets of grammatical structures animated by a time-varying vocabulary. Grammars manifestly evolve too, if at a slower pace perhaps. Whatever)]]></description>
