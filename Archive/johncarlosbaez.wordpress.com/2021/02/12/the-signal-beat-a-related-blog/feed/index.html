Hi Peter, that&#039;s not a subject I&#039;ve given much thought to, but I see the interest in it.  As you have considered it, feel free to share any of the key points that you see.   That paper is behind a paywall.  How mathematical are the treatments you have seen?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi David

In your intellectual travels have you turned your mind to the problem of why moderate views rarely prevail? A few years ago Seth Marvel and Steve Strogatz and some other researchers published a paper on that subject: https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.118702

Others have worked on social contagion models on networks.  There is a guy whose  name escapes me who has been a long term recipient of US Defence department research contracts and he did some modelling on how a few influencers on Facebook could wreak havoc with the US hospital system.

In this age of atomisation of everything the study of how opinions coalesce is a fascinating subject.

Cheers

Peter]]></description>
