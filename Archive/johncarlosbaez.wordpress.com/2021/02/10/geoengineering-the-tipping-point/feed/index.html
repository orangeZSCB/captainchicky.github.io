One word: Malthus.  Any programme which increases the amount of food merely shoves the over-population problem into the future.  The population of Earth needs to be low enough to be sustainable.

One could even argue that it is morally better to let &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; people starve now if that somehow forces a move to a more sustainable world, rather than &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt; people starving later, as well inevitably be the case, with &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;&#062;&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;.]]></description>

The Wikipedia article seems to indicate that subsequent studies have yielded more promising results. But I have not looked at the original papers.

The things I like about ocean fertilization (if it works at scale) are:


It actually sequesters carbon and mitigates ocean acidification.
Increased fishery yields are an almost baked-in consequence of any successful ocean fertilization program. And, while that does not technically sequester any carbon, it does feed a hungry planet. Which is an important subsidiary goal in any program to mitigate the deleterious effects of climate change.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I agree with these two sentences.

Reducing emissions is great: there are even many ways to do it and &lt;em&gt;save&lt;/em&gt; money, and we haven&#039;t adopted those nearly as fast as we should.

Removing greenhouses gases from the atmosphere is harder, but  there&#039;s a lot we can do, and I&#039;ve written about that:

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2020/01/12/can-we-fix-the-air/&quot;&gt;Can we fix the air?&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Azimuth&lt;/i&gt;, 12 January 2020.

Adaptation is also hugely important.

My point in this article, as in &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2013/03/11/geoengineering-report/&quot;&gt;the last&lt;/a&gt;, is not to advocate geoengineering but to warn people that sometime---and I think sometime soon, probably before 2040 but maybe much sooner---public opinion will flip to embracing geoengineering, and it will be almost unstoppable.  So, we have to think about it and study it.

The main defects I see of geoengineering with stratospheric aerosols are the one you pointed out---it will change weather patterns in ways that may not be easy to predict---and that it won&#039;t do anything to stop ocean acidification.]]></description>

I believe the amounts of sulfuric acid produced by this form of geoengineering are small compared to those involved in acid rain.  In any event, this is something people have studied, so it doesn&#039;t make much sense to argue about it before we read the literature.  Here&#039;s one paper:

&#8226; Kravitz, B., Robock, A., Oman, L., Stenchikov, G., &#038; Marquardt, A. B, &lt;a href=&quot;https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2009JD011918&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Sulfuric acid deposition from stratospheric geoengineering with sulfate aerosols&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres&lt;/em&gt; 114 (2009).

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Abstract.&lt;/strong&gt; We used a general circulation model of Earth&#039;s climate to conduct geoengineering experiments involving stratospheric injection of sulfur dioxide and analyzed the resulting deposition of sulfate. When sulfur dioxide is injected into the tropical or Arctic stratosphere, the main additional surface deposition of sulfate occurs in midlatitude bands, because of strong cross‐tropopause flux in the jet stream regions. We used critical load studies to determine the effects of this increase in sulfate deposition on terrestrial ecosystems by assuming the upper limit of hydration of all sulfate aerosols into sulfuric acid. For annual injection of 5 Tg of SO2 into the tropical stratosphere or 3 Tg of SO2 into the Arctic stratosphere, neither the maximum point value of sulfate deposition of approximately 1.5 mEq m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; a&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; nor the largest additional deposition that would result from geoengineering of approximately 0.05 mEq m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; a&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is enough to negatively impact most ecosystems.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There are approaches to geo-engineering besides stratospheric aerosols.  These include things like removing CO2 from the atmosphere, planting shade tress, seeding clouds, or painting mountain-tops to reflect sunlight. I would especially encourage research into seeding clouds– ships and other things are already seeding clouds, so we need to understand what we are already doing.

I&#039;m very skeptical of stratospheric aerosols for a lot of reasons, but we aren&#039;t dealing with a bank account, where it&#039;s as simple as balancing heat-in and heat-out.

1) Heat tends to enter the atmosphere near the tropics and leave near the poles.  CO2 prevents heat from escaping, so we are seeing more heating near the poles.

2) The difference in temperature between the mid-latitudes and the poles maintains the jet stream, and the weakening of the jet stream is one of the main drivers of extreme weather events today.

3) Blocking incoming sunlight would tend to cool the tropics more than the poles and this would further weaken the temperature gradient.  It might therefore make for more extreme weather events.

Whatever your thoughts on stratospheric aerosols, it is only one potential geoengineering strategy.  I would focus my energy on understanding what we are already doing, looking for ways to reduce emissions and/or remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, and adapting to the changes already underway.]]></description>

It&#039;s not sulfur per se, it&#039;s sulfur dioxide or sulfuric acid which is under consideration. They&#039;re talking about placing it at altitudes of roughly 58,000 feet - the top of the troposphere a/k/a the tropopause. If you see a thunderhead with a flat top like an anvil, you&#039;re essentially looking at the tropopause - &quot;Well-developed cumulonimbus clouds are characterized by a flat, anvil-like top (anvil dome), caused by wind shear or inversion near the tropopause. The shelf of the anvil may precede the main cloud&#039;s vertical component for many kilometres, and be accompanied by lightning. Occasionally, rising air parcels surpass the equilibrium level (due to momentum) and form an overshooting top culminating at the maximum parcel level. When vertically developed, this largest of all clouds usually extends through all three cloud regions. Even the smallest cumulonimbus cloud dwarfs its neighbors in comparison.&quot; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulonimbus_cloud

So you end up with rainout - and the rainout is acid rain, which has bad effects on the environment - https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B0122268652001565]]></description>
