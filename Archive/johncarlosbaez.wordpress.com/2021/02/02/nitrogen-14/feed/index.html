					<description><![CDATA[Over on Physics StackExchange, &lt;a href=&quot;https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/612974/112768&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;ProfRob writes&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I think it is down to the production mechanism in the case of 14N vs other N isotopes.

Nitrogen-14 is the dominant catalysed by-product of the CNO hydrogen burning cycle, which powers stars with mass $latex &#062;1.5 M_{\odot}$. There has been plenty of time in the universe for such stars to have completed their lives and returned their nucleosynthetic products to the interstellar medium. Further, because the birth mass distribution for stars strongly favours lower masses ($latex N(M)\propto M^{-2.3}$), as opposed to higher mass stars that might process the nitrogen further, there are lots of &quot;production sites&quot; in a typical galaxy.

The reasons that 14N ends up having the highest equilibrium concentration of the C, N, O isotopes involved in the CNO cycle is discussed in https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/587699/43351. In summary, the proton capture reaction that converts 14N to 15O is a relatively slow &quot;radiative capture&quot; involving the electromagnetic interaction and emission of a gamma ray. The other proton captures in the CNO cycle go via the strong interaction or are faster because they involve no Coulomb barrier (beta decays). In particular, 15N is very rapidly turned back into 12C by a strong proton capture followed by alpha decay. As a result, when the cycle reaches equilibrium, the 14N proton capture is the slowest reaction and the 14N content of the star builds up.

In intermediate mass stars ($latex 1.5-8 M_\odot$) a significant part of the CNO cycle burning takes place in shells around the core. Towards the ends of the lives of these stars, there are instabilities that cause mixing of the nuclear processed material into the envelope, which can then be ejected into the interstellar medium via strong winds.

As for the other isotopes in your question, Deuterium, 6Li and 10B are very fragile and are easily burned in stellar interiors at temperatures below that required for hydrogen burning. The same is true of 7Li and 11B (the dominant isotopes), but the temperature requirements are higher and there are also production mechanisms for these isotopes inside intermediate mass stars (see the  &quot;Cameron-Fowler mechanism&quot;) or in classical novae.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A wild speculation, but perhaps fun:

Picture:

https://westy31.home.xs4all.nl/ScrapBook/FanoNeutrons.png

In the Fano plane, there are 7 &quot;points&quot;-&#062; Protons, and 7 lines -&#062;Neutrons.  You can create a 3D version of the Fano plane in the shape of an octahedron: The points are the 6 vertices plus 1 center point. The 7 lines are 4 alternate faces of the octahedron plus 3 axis. (XYZ).

Each proton is then surrounded by 3 neutrons, and each neutron is surrounded by 3 protons.

The strong force (as I just learned from Wikipedia), attracts best between adjacent protons and neutrons with the same spin.  But proton-proton and neutron-neutron with the same spin don&#039;t like being adjacent because of Pauli. So when the numbers are even, it is easier to form pairs of the same spin, while keeping the total spin zero.]]></description>

When a star gets old and starts emitting lots of gas (a &quot;planetary nebula&quot;) or blows up (a &quot;nova&quot; or &quot;supernova&quot;), presumably some nitrogen still hanging around gets out.

The CNO cycle must be sort of like a carousel in a fairground: when it stops going round and round, you get off wherever you are.]]></description>

I should know this but I don’t.  If the cycle is complete, then, yes, nitrogen is essentially a catalyst and neither created nor destroyed.  But perhaps it is not always complete?

I’m sure that someone knows the answer to this!]]></description>

Thanks.   Somehow I missed that!   Of course, the CNO cycle destroys as much nitrogen-14 as it creates!

&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/CNO_Cycle.svg/400px-CNO_Cycle.svg.png&quot;/&gt;

But I guess if something creates either carbon-12 or oxygen-16, the CNO cycle will turn some of that into nitrogen-14.

This is vaguely connected to my next post:

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2021/02/04/the-hoyle-state/&quot;&gt;The Hoyle state&lt;/a&gt;.

which concerns how carbon-12 gets produced in the first place.

I guess carbon-12 gets produced from collisions between beryllium-8 and helium-4, and then some of it becomes nitrogen-14.]]></description>

From the same Wikipedia article:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  Of the nine primordial odd–odd nuclides (five stable and four radioactive with long half lives), only 14 7N is the most common isotope of a common element. This is the case because it is a part of the CNO cycle. The nuclides 6 3Li and 10 5B are minority isotopes of elements that are themselves rare compared to other light elements, while the other six isotopes make up only a tiny percentage of the natural abundance of their elements. For example, 180m73Ta is thought to be the rarest of the 252 stable nuclides.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>
