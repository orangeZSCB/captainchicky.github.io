High metal content: iron, aluminum, nickel. Very porous, can hold a lot of water after rains. One of the most common subsoil rocks in the world: possibly the major component of the rocky layer below about a third of the land surface of the world. In these high plateaus, the rain washes off the soil, leaving the laterite layer exposed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My wife Lisa asked if the same unusual species were found in different serpentine barrens.   The answer is yes, at least for the &#039;serpentine aster&#039;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphyotrichum_depauperatum&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Symphyotrichum depauperatum&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/div&gt;

It lives in 20 of the 26 remaining large pine barrens on the east coast of the US!

&#8226;  Danny J. Gustafson and Roger Earl Latham, Is the serpentine aster, &lt;em&gt;Symphyotrichum depauperatum&lt;/em&gt; (Fern.) Nesom, a valid species and actually endemic to eastern serpentine barrens?, &lt;em&gt;Biodiversity &#038; Conservation&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;14&lt;/strong&gt; (2005), 1445–1452.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Abstract.&lt;/strong&gt; Serpentine aster, &lt;em&gt;Symphyotrichum depauperatum&lt;/em&gt; (Fern.) Nesom, is the ‘flagship’ species of the eastern serpentine barrens, inhabiting 20 of the 26 remaining occurrences of significant size of this globally rare community type and long recognized as its only known endemic species. Previous studies have called into question both the validity of the taxon and its status as a true endemic of the serpentine barrens. We used amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis to compare seven serpentine barrens populations, one alleged diabase glade population, and two populations each of the two species with which &lt;em&gt;S. depauperatum&lt;/em&gt; is lumped by some authors. Our analysis supports the validity of &lt;em&gt;S. depauperatum&lt;/em&gt; as a distinct species, which grows almost entirely on shallow soils overlying serpentinite bedrock in Pennsylvania and Maryland, but it confirms an earlier hypothesis that &lt;em&gt;S. depauperatum&lt;/em&gt; also includes small, disjunct populations on diabase glades in North Carolina.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Now I need to learn about diabase glades!]]></description>

Neat!  I don&#039;t know anything about laterite.  Does it have some special features that make these plateaus inhospitable?   (Like, maybe it&#039;s very hard, so it doesn&#039;t decompose much, so it doesn&#039;t provide soil?  Or maybe it doesn&#039;t provide the minerals plants like?)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2021/02/19/serpentine-barrens/#comment-169491&quot;&gt;Jason Erbele&lt;/a&gt;.

Scott Weidensaul is a very good writer and he has a way of making everything fascinating.  The slip---&quot;mammals&quot; for &quot;animals&quot;---was my fault, not his.

I don&#039;t think shale barrens arise from toxicity.  Weidensaul says that black shale on the southern sides of mountains in the Appalachians gets blistering hot in the summer sun, and I guess water runs right off.    The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.org/en-us/get-involved/how-to-help/places-we-protect/potts-creek-shale-barren/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Nature Conservancy&lt;/a&gt; says this about their Potts Creek preserve:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  A shale barren is a steep, south-facing, eroding slope of thinly bedded, weathered shale, having sparse tree cover and little soil, found in the Ridge and Valley province from southern Pennsylvania to southern Virginia.
  
  At least three rare species native to shale barrens occur at Potts Creek: chestnut lipfern, Kate&#039;s mountain clover and Virginia nailwort. Numerous other species not restricted to, but regarded as characteristic of shale barrens, are found here. These include Allegheny rockcress, Allegheny stonecrop, mosspink, and white-haired leatherflower.
  
  Trees that manage to grow on the barrens, such as red cedar, chestnut oak and Virginia pine, are small for their age, reaching about 20 feet in height and 15 inches in diameter. Like many desert trees, the trees at Potts Creek are dwarfed, twisted and gnarled by the elements. Thick, hairy leaves protect some shale barren plants against desiccation, and their deep root systems tap what little water exists.
  
  The uniqueness of the shale barren&#039;s flora remained unnoticed until the late 1800s, when botanists collected plants on the shale slopes of Kate&#039;s Mountain, West Virginia. To their surprise, many of these plants were new to science, and Kate&#039;s Mountain become the type locality for a number of shale barren endemic species, including Kate&#039;s mountain clover and white-haired leatherflower.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So yet again, the harshness of the environment ironically leads to biodiversity---including the only cacti on the east coast of the US.

Hang in there, Toby!  In the next paragraph I gave it away:

  Serpentine, you see, is made of magnesium, silicon, iron, hydrogen and oxygen.

If I had to give a single formula for all the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpentine_subgroup&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;serpentine subgroup&lt;/a&gt; minerals, I guess it would be &#039;hydrous magnesium iron phyllosilicate&#039;: ((Mg, Fe)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).
