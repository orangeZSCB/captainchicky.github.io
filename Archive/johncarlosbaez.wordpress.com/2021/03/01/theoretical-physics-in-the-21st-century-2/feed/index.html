Yeah, one problem with giving talks remotely is that you don&#039;t get a free dinner.  On the bright side, you don&#039;t have to sit squashed in airplane seats.]]></description>

I’ve sometimes seen people fly in just to give their talk, or even for the opening speech.  (The only thing more absurd would be flying in just to give the conference summary.). Those are usually relatively well known people, and the conference thinks that it is worth it to have them (and pays their way), and it strokes the egos of those invited.  But, at least these days, one can probably find a better version of the talk on the web.  The main point of a conference are the many conversations which take place outside of the talks.  For that reason, I prefer to go to conferences where everyone stays and eats in the same place.

Then there are those people who stay almost a week or whatever, but then leave a few hours or a day earlier.  I’m convinced that many of those aren’t actually going somewhere important, but want people to think that they are.  :-&#124;

On the other hand, electric planes are being developed, and if charged with green electricity, we can fly again with a good conscience.]]></description>

There are things like that, such as a cosmology conference which consists of non-trivial hikes in the Alps.  But the problem is that most people still have to get to the Alps.  :-&#124;

Probably the main reason that people in the U.S., emit 4 times as much carbon dioxide as in Switzerland is the lack of efficient public transportation.

But, of course, one needs to concentrate on actual problems.  In a populist move (because opinions have changed), more and more parties are advocating a speed limit on German highways for environmental reasons.  As John said in his talk, you have to look at the numbers.  A speed limit on German highways would reduce Germany’s carbon-dioxide emissions by a whopping one half of one per cent.  If done at all, there should be exceptions for electric cars, at least if charged with green energy, and of course it is absurd to have a huge SUV which uses more fuel going slow than a subcompact travelling at twice the speed.]]></description>

Maybe we can return to the old style of pilgrimages where people walk a hundred kilometers or so to get to a conference, talking with other like-minded people on the trip.   It could easily be more productive of new ideas than flying somewhere and flying back.]]></description>

Yes, I was there.  Certainly better than nothing.  I see the problem with flying to conferences.  (Fortunately, I live in the middle of Europe and can (and do) drive to most conferences with my electric car.)  However, as the famous quote (see below) says, conferences are like medieval pilgrimages.  Yes, there is a goal, but things which happen along the way are at least as important, and most of those don’t happen with video conferences.  One could even argue that the ostensible purpose of conferences can be fulfilled without an actual conference these days, but there is no substitute for other stuff.

&lt;blockquote&gt;

The modern conference resembles the pilgrimage of medieval Christendom in that it allows the participants to indulge themselves in all the pleasures and diversions of travel while appearing to be austerely bent on self-improvement.  To be sure, there are certain penitential exercises to be performed---the presentation of a paper, perhaps, and certainly listening to the papers of others.  But with this excuse you journey to new and interesting places, meet new and interesting people, and form new and interesting relationships with them; exchange gossip and confidences (for your well-worn stories are fresh to them, and vice versa); eat, drink and make merry in their company every evening; and yet, at the end if it all, return home with an enhanced reputation for seriousness of mind.  Today&#039;s conferees have an additional advantage over pilgrims of old in that their expenses are usually paid, or at least subsidised, by the institution to which they belong, be it a government department, a commercial firm, or, most commonly perhaps, a university.

That thread is about a brand-new paper by Urs Schreiber and Hisham Sati.   I used to work on higher categories and physics, but not anymore.   It&#039;s not the sort of thing where one can just read a bit now and then and then explain it to everyone.   This is an introduction to some of Urs Schreiber&#039;s ideas:
