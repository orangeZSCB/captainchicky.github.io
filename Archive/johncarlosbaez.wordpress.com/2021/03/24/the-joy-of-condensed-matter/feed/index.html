When a hole moves, it&#039;s really a &lt;em&gt;bunch&lt;/em&gt; of electrons moving around, and mass is just a measure of how much energy it takes for something to move around.  So it seems quite plausible that a hole would have a larger mass than an electron.   It&#039;s actually surprising that sometimes a hole has a smaller mass than an electron.   But in fact both the electron mass and the hole mass can vary widely depending on the material they find themselves in.   It all depends on how much energy it takes to move around the relevant stuff.]]></description>

I totally get the &quot;less energy than a single electron&quot; &#8212; it&#039;s it taking &lt;em&gt;much more&lt;/em&gt; that throws me. If I understand, it&#039;s because one hole has the apparent mass of &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; electrons? (Apologies if I&#039;m coming off as dim-witted, but I like to be sure I&#039;m 100% clear on things like this.)]]></description>

I tried to answer your question but I&#039;ll say it again, shorter.  When a hole is moving, it&#039;s actually a bunch of electrons moving, since a hole is just a place where an electron isn&#039;t.  So, there&#039;s no reason to suspect that a hole moving will take less energy than a single electron moving.]]></description>

(Sorry for the delay in replying. Real life got distracting.) What puzzled me was that, in the post you wrote &lt;em&gt;&quot;if the hole is much heavier than the electron&quot;&lt;/em&gt; and I wondered how, in the same material and under the same conditions (?), the hole could be much heavier. Them both having the same mass makes sense, but what makes the hole heavy enough to act like a proton is what I didn&#039;t understand.]]></description>

Yes, I should have given the usual name for these materials: &quot;hyperbolic metamaterials&quot;.  Here&#039;s an explanation that&#039;s available for free:

					<description><![CDATA[To me the hardest thing to wrap my brain around is the treatment of identical particles in multibody wave functions. While the mathematics isn&#039;t particularly hard to get since condensed matter physicists don&#039;t particularly care about special relativity, it is still mind-boggling that you and me have electrons that are supposedly anti-symmetric with each other. Even though there shouldn&#039;t be any observable effects given our distance, it nevertheless gives me a slightly nauseous feeling that my feet are on wobbly ground.]]></description>

Another interesting recent example along these lines is the work of Seiberg and Shao.  They are using QFT to describe exotic states of matter called fractons.  A key part of their story is the need to make sense of QFT with discontinuous fields.  So along the way new things are learned about QFT itself.

Another comment about black holes is that part of the reason they blur the line between hep-th and condensed matter is that from one perspective they belong to particle physics (they&#039;re characterized by mass and spin only, GR breaks down at the singularity), but from another perspective they are condensed matter systems (entropy, temperature, evaporation).]]></description>

Neat!  My guess about &quot;accel. temp&quot; is that it&#039;s about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unruh_effect&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Unruh effect&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Unruh effect is the hypothetical prediction that an accelerating observer will observe a thermal bath, like blackbody radiation, whereas an inertial observer would observe none. In other words, the background appears to be warm from an accelerating reference frame; in layman&#039;s terms, an accelerating thermometer (like one being waved around) in empty space, subtracting any other contribution to its temperature, will record a non-zero temperature, just from its acceleration. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>
