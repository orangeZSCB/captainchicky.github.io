					<description><![CDATA[Laws or not, Massachusetts &lt;a href=&quot;https://667-per-cm.net/2020/09/29/opposition-to-solar-pv-field-at-new-hanlon-deerfield-school-westwood-ma/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;has other problems as well&lt;/a&gt; , including a weak counties system, NIMBYism on land-based wind and solar dressed up as concern over dwindling natural open spaces, and town bylaws which inhibit degrees of solar build out on private properties despite there being a statewide Right-to-Solar law. It should be noted that the open space concern really is NIMBYism because when another project was proposed to be built on 90% cleared fields owned by a county, it received loud and vociferous opposition on this point, including by local state reps. However, when a project was proposed and approved for clearing roughly 200 acres of forest far away for a 50 MW solar farm, the same opposition didn&#039;t utter a peep.

Still, &lt;a href=&quot;https://667-per-cm.net/2021/01/29/the-recipe-for-success-of-green-energy-in-the-massachusetts-suburbs/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;there&#039;s hope this will turn around&lt;/a&gt; once &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rethinkx.com/energy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;the enormous economic advantages&lt;/a&gt; of zero carbon energy are appreciated. It may mean, though, that Massachusetts ends up being late to the party and ends up with expensive dregs.]]></description>
