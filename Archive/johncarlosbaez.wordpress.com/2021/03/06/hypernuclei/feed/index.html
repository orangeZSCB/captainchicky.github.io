Rather little of a baryon&#039;s mass is due to the mass of its component quarks; most of the mass is due to the energy of the cloud of virtual quarks and gluons in the baryon.     The u, d, and s are &quot;arranged&quot; differently in the &#931;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; and the &#923;, and this makes their cloud of virtual quarks and gluons have different energies.

What do I mean by &quot;arranged&quot;?   Well, quantum theory is all about linear combinations of things, and very roughly, we have

$latex \Sigma^0 =[(ds-sd)u+(us-su)d]/2$

and

$latex \Lambda = [2(ud-du)s+(us-su)d+(sd-ds)u]/\sqrt{12}$

A computation showing this is &lt;a href=&quot;https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/321439/112768&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

That&#039;s a sketchy answer to a question that quickly gets very technical!   It&#039;s quite hard to compute the mass of a baryon from first principles, though it has been done.]]></description>

Wow!  This reminds me of how Benjamin Franklin chose the sign of electrical charge so that electrons turned out to be negative... making the flow of electric current the opposite of the way the electrons are moving.

This chart on Wikipedia looks right:

Yes, all that is correct.  The SU(2) symmetry between u and d is just approximate, and the SU(3) symmetry between u, d and s is even worse.

It&#039;s a sign of divine benevolence that this approximate SU(3) symmetry led Gell--Mann and other physicists to take group representation theory seriously, eventually discovering the exact SU(3) &#215; SU(2) &#215; U(1) symmetry of the Standard Model, where the SU(3) does something completely different, and the SU(2) is somewhat related: the left-handed u and d quarks are a doublet for this &quot;weak isospin&quot;, but the right-handed ones are singlets.

In particle physics, especially in the early days, the approximate symmetry was easier to notice than an exact symmetry would have been: it&#039;s often easier to see there are several suspiciously &lt;em&gt;similar&lt;/em&gt; kinds of particles than to see there are several &lt;em&gt;exactly identical&lt;/em&gt; kinds of particles.

Richard Block, a Lie theorist now emeritus at U.C. Riverside, regularly played tennis with Gell--Mann back when Gell--Mann was trying to understand baryons and mesons.  Gell--Mann wanted a generalization of $latex \mathfrak{su}(2)$ to deal with strangeness.  He tried 4-dimensional Lie algebras... 5-dimensional Lie algebras... 6-dimensional Lie algebras... 7-dimensional Lie algebras... and none of them worked!   After tennis one day he mentioned this to Block, who suggested trying an 8-dimensional one: $latex \mathfrak{su}(3).$]]></description>

We may as well cut out group theory. That is a subject that will never be of any use in physics.

Hmm, interesting.  The people on &lt;a href=&quot;https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/248661/how-can-lambda0-and-sigma0-both-have-uds-quark-content&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Physics StackExchange&lt;/a&gt; are mainly asking about what is &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; about the two particles in that central weight space: the &#923;, which is the hyperon I was talking about a lot already, and the &#931;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;.   So I&#039;ll answer that first, and then get to your actual question.

These two particles are similar in some ways.  They&#039;re both made of an up quark, a down quark and a strange quark, so they&#039;re both electrically neutral.   The &#923; is 1.19 times as massive as the proton.  The &#931;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; is 1.27 times as massive.

On the other hand, they&#039;re dramatically different in other ways!

The &#923; can only decay via the weak interaction because it&#039;s the lightest baryon containing a strange quark, and its also too light to decay into a proton and a strange meson: even the lightest strange meson is too heavy for that.   So, the lifetime of the &#923; is a whopping 0.26 nanoseconds.

The &#931;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, being heavier, can decay into a &#923; and a photon.   This decay happens electromagnetically, I guess, so the lifetime of the &#931;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; is much shorter: just 7.4 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;-20&lt;/sup&gt; seconds!

How are they different mathematically?   Well, you know that, but I&#039;ll say it like a physicist.

The SU(3) group here acts on the $latex \mathbb{C}^3$ whose basis is u, d, and s (the three relevant quarks).  It has an SU(2) subgroup that leaves s alone and acts on the $latex \mathbb{C}^2$ whose basis is u and d.   This SU(2) symmetry is called &lt;b&gt;isospin symmetry&lt;/b&gt;.

If we take the baryon octet and think of it as a representation of SU(2), it&#039;s reducible.   The &#923; lives in its own little &#039;isospin singlet&#039;: that is, a 1-dimensional trivial representation of isospin SU(2).   The &#931;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, on the other hand, lives in an &#039;isospin triplet&#039;: that is, the 3-dimensional adjoint representation of isospin SU(2)

So, the &#923; is a kind of loner, while the &#931;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; is part of a little family containing also the positively charged &#931;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and the negatively charged &#931;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; (which, of course, is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the antiparticle of the &#931;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;).

However, the &#931;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and the &#931;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; cannot decay as quickly as the &#931;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; can, because only the &#931;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; has a lighter particle made of the same quarks: namely, the &#923;.   These other particles can only decay by getting rid of their strange quark!  So, they decay via the weak interaction.

As it turns out, the &#931;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; decays in 8 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;-11&lt;/sup&gt; seconds, and the &#931;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; decays in 1.5 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;-10&lt;/sup&gt; seconds. These are respectably long amounts of time.

So, finally getting around to your question: what happens due to the &#923; and &#931;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; sitting at the same weight space in the baryon octet?   The answer is that this enables the heavier one of these two particles to quickly decay into the lighter one!

&lt;img width=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physical/baryon_octet.png&quot; /&gt;

Here are the mean lifetimes of the particles in the baryon octet.  the &#931;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; really stands out!

n: 879 seconds
p: infinite, as far as we know
&#931;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;: 8 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;-11&lt;/sup&gt; seconds
&#931;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;: 7.4 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;-20&lt;/sup&gt; seconds
&#931;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;: 1.5 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;-10&lt;/sup&gt; seconds
&#923;: 2.7 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;-10&lt;/sup&gt; seconds
&#926;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;: 2.9 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;-10&lt;/sup&gt; seconds
&#926;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;: 1.7 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;-10&lt;/sup&gt; seconds]]></description>

<p>The &Lambda; can only decay via the weak interaction because it&#8217;s the lightest baryon containing a strange quark, and its also too light to decay into a proton and a strange meson: even the lightest strange meson is too heavy for that.   So, the lifetime of the &Lambda; is a whopping 0.26 nanoseconds.</p>
<p>The &Sigma;<sup>0</sup>, being heavier, can decay into a &Lambda; and a photon.   This decay happens electromagnetically, I guess, so the lifetime of the &Sigma;<sup>0</sup> is much shorter: just 7.4 &times; 10<sup>-20</sup> seconds!</p>
<p>How are they different mathematically?   Well, you know that, but I&#8217;ll say it like a physicist.</p>
<p>The SU(3) group here acts on the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BC%7D%5E3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{C}^3" class="latex" /> whose basis is u, d, and s (the three relevant quarks).  It has an SU(2) subgroup that leaves s alone and acts on the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BC%7D%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{C}^2" class="latex" /> whose basis is u and d.   This SU(2) symmetry is called <b>isospin symmetry</b>.</p>
<p>If we take the baryon octet and think of it as a representation of SU(2), it&#8217;s reducible.   The &Lambda; lives in its own little &#8216;isospin singlet&#8217;: that is, a 1-dimensional trivial representation of isospin SU(2).   The &Sigma;<sup>0</sup>, on the other hand, lives in an &#8216;isospin triplet&#8217;: that is, the 3-dimensional adjoint representation of isospin SU(2)</p>
<p>So, the &Lambda; is a kind of loner, while the &Sigma;<sup>0</sup> is part of a little family containing also the positively charged &Sigma;<sup>+</sup> and the negatively charged &Sigma;<sup>&#8211;</sup> (which, of course, is <em>not</em> the antiparticle of the &Sigma;<sup>+</sup>).</p>
<p>However, the &Sigma;<sup>+</sup> and the &Sigma;<sup>&#8211;</sup> cannot decay as quickly as the &Sigma;<sup>0</sup> can, because only the &Sigma;<sup>0</sup> has a lighter particle made of the same quarks: namely, the &Lambda;.   These other particles can only decay by getting rid of their strange quark!  So, they decay via the weak interaction.</p>
<p>As it turns out, the &Sigma;<sup>+</sup> decays in 8 &times; 10<sup>-11</sup> seconds, and the &Sigma;<sup>&#8211;</sup> decays in 1.5 &times; 10<sup>-10</sup> seconds. These are respectably long amounts of time.</p>
<p>So, finally getting around to your question: what happens due to the &Lambda; and &Sigma;<sup>0</sup> sitting at the same weight space in the baryon octet?   The answer is that this enables the heavier one of these two particles to quickly decay into the lighter one!</p>
<p><img width="300" src="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physical/baryon_octet.png" /></p>
<p>Here are the mean lifetimes of the particles in the baryon octet.  the &Sigma;<sub>0</sub> really stands out!</p>
<p>n: 879 seconds<br />
p: infinite, as far as we know<br />
&Sigma;<sup>+</sup>: 8 &times; 10<sup>-11</sup> seconds<br />
&Sigma;<sup>0</sup>: 7.4 &times; 10<sup>-20</sup> seconds<br />
&Sigma;<sup>&#8211;</sup>: 1.5 &times; 10<sup>-10</sup> seconds<br />
&Lambda;: 2.7 &times; 10<sup>-10</sup> seconds<br />
&Xi;<sup>0</sup>: 2.9 &times; 10<sup>-10</sup> seconds<br />
&Xi;<sup>&#8211;</sup>: 1.7 &times; 10<sup>-10</sup> seconds</p>
