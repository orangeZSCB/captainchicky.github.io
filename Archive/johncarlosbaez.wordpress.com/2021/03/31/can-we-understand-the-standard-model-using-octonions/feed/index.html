  PI has quite a lot at YT, as can be seen by visiting YT and searching on &quot;Perimeter Institute&quot;, but I could not find these lectures.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These are top-secret lectures for experts only.

Just kidding!   How many of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://pirsa.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Perimeter Institute Recorded Seminar Archive&lt;/a&gt; lectures are on YouTube, anyway?

I don&#039;t really care if these lectures of mine are on YouTube except that it might slightly increase the chance of their being preserved for a long time.   I downloaded copies for that reason.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I massively revised my second deck of slides:

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/standard/standard_octonions_web.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Can we understand the Standard Model using octonions?&lt;/a&gt;

I now give a rough explanation of why the subgroups

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
$latex (\mathrm{SU}(3) \times \mathrm{SU}(3))/\mathbb{Z}_2,  \; \mathrm{Spin}(9) \subset \mathrm{F}_4 $
&lt;/div&gt;

show up in this game, and why their intersection is the true gauge group of the Standard Model.]]></description>

It depends a lot on what you mean by &quot;the idea&quot;.   Cohl Furey and Mia Hughes have some ideas involving the Standard Model and octonions, Kirill Krasnov has some others, Latham Boyle has some others and Dubois-Violette and Todorov have some others!

My talks only describe some mathematical facts connecting octonions and the Standard Model---I&#039;m not proposing a theory. The most exciting of these facts was first discovered by Dubois-Violette and Todorov, and my second talk explains it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was fascinated by Cohl Furey&#039;s YouTube lectures on octonions and the standard model. Although a great deal of it was over my head (I&#039;m still chewing on quaternions, and Clifford algebras are foreign territory to me), the stuff that wasn&#039;t seemed to make a lot of sense. At the time it seemed very speculative, but maybe the idea is taking hold?]]></description>
