Cool!  Now he&#039;s making robots that can juggle and do category theory at the same time.]]></description>

I haven&#039;t thought about including dynamics in the paths.  But amusingly, I have another student, &lt;a href=&quot;https://joemathjoe.wordpress.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Joe Moeller&lt;/a&gt;, who recently got a job at NIST where he is talking to someone at NASA about the interplanetary superhighway.

Hmm, I now see &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; invented interplanetary superhighway---and you&#039;re at NASA!  Are you talking to Joe Moeller?  If not, I should put him in touch with you.]]></description>

Thank you so much for your student&#039;s work!
Do you see possibilities for including dynamics in the paths - for example to consider different models with increasing fidelity in a categoric frame work? e.g. orbits around the Moon in 3 models: Restricted 3 Body, Bicircular 4 Body, JPL Ephemeris.]]></description>

I doubt this particular session on compositional robotics will talk much about the path planning problem.  But by the way, I have a student who just wrote a paper about category theory and the shortest path problem for graphs:

&#8226; Jade Master, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06682&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;The open algebraic path problem&lt;/a&gt;.

She expounds on it in more detail in her thesis:

&#8226; Jade Master, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12905&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Composing Behaviors of Networks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wonder if the &quot;compositionality of robotics&quot; will also consider the complexity of the &quot;path planning problem&quot;. The &quot;Konigsberg Bridge Problem&quot; and the &quot;Traveling Salesmen Problem&quot; are simple examples that path planning is a non-trivial subject. When robotic spacecraft are introduced, the dynamics of the path becomes an even more challenging problem.There is no serious treatment of the categorical nature of space trajectory design at present to my knowledge. Without a detailed knowledge of the possible space trajectories, there is no way to apply AI methods to path planning in space. Just imagine the GPS satellites without maps of the roads and cities on Earth. Knowing the detailed Lat Lon of your location will not help you get to UCLA Campus East Entrance.]]></description>
