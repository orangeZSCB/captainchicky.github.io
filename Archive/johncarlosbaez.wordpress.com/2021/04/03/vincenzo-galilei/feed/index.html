&lt;i&gt;Laudate Dominum&lt;/i&gt; by Pierre De Manchicourt, on that &lt;i&gt;Utopia Triumphans&lt;/i&gt; collection you pointed me to, is also very easy to love.  I hadn&#039;t heard of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_de_Manchicourt&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Pierre De Manchicourt&lt;/a&gt; before!  He&#039;s also from the Franco-Flemish school that I&#039;m trying to get to know, but from a later era than I&#039;ve been looking at: his dates are 1510– 1564.

Thanks!   A while back I bought the Tallis Scholars&#039; &lt;em&gt;Missa Maria zart&lt;/em&gt;, which is so far the only thing I&#039;ve seriously listened to by Obrecht.  I&#039;ll need to listen to it many more times to understand it!  It&#039;s very strange and interesting.  Someday, when I&#039;m starting to understand the piece, it&#039;ll be fun to listen to it on YouTube while watching the score.

Ockeghem’s &lt;em&gt;Deo Gratias&lt;/em&gt; is amazing: it sort of knocks your socks off, with the echo-like effect.  Here is a version with a score:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bYGmISF3ME

I don&#039;t think this is the only way to perform the piece; some of this is the Huelgas Ensemble&#039;s own idea:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In this rendition by Paul Van Nevel no more than 18 voices are singing contemporarily, due to the canonic response that makes upper voices to complete the melody while lower voices start singing. As soon as the first voice of the fourth chorus (B1, on the bass chorus) reaches its final note every voice &quot;freezes&quot; at its current line in melody, eventually bringing the canon to a halt and forming the final chord.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That could be a bit of a modern invention.]]></description>

Regarding the Obrecht Maria Zart, a google on 
obrecht tallis scholars 
turned up a 1:08:44 YouTube video with scrolling score
https://youtu.be/iaCYf6GWXPY
which purports to be of the Tallis Scholars performance of that mass.
The description for that video contains extensive notes from Peter Phlilips.]]></description>

Let me add a personal favorite, Ockeghem&#039;s Deo Gratias. The audio is on the above, but here some gorgeous visuals add immensely to the feeling of timeless serenity.

Thanks!  I plan to blog about some of my favorite polyphonic composers, but you can get a preview of what I plan to say by looking at my diary:

					<description><![CDATA[Dear John Baez, I just wanted to forward your interesting posting on Vincenzo Galilei; previously I was wondering first that he would have looked more like Kepler then his famous son, now I see, that the link you are using leads to a site with the wrong portrait.

&#124; &#124;  &#124;  &#124;  Vincenzo Galilei. &quot;Dialogo della musica antica et della moderna&quot;

They use erroneously this portrait of Kepler https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Johannes_Kepler_1610.jpg

Kind regards,
Renate

I suppose by &quot;under&quot; the south pole they meant the pole of the sky? In that time, people presumably had more occasion to talk about the celestial poles than those of Earth, as the former could easily be seen while no European had even come close to the latter. As this was after Vasco da Gama and Magellan, the southern sky was also already known to Europeans at the time.
So by &quot;that part of the earth under the south pole which is called unknown&quot;, they would probably have meant the extreme southern part of the earth, unknown to Europeans at the time, which was under the celestial south pole. According to Wikipedia, the hypothetical continent &quot;Terra australis incognita&quot; was already being depicted on maps in the 16th century.]]></description>
