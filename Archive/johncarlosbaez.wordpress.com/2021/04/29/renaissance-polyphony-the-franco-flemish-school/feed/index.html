					<description><![CDATA[Thanks so much for this! I saw something you wrote a week ago about Ockeghem, who at the time I had never heard of. After listening to him on youtube for a bit, the algorithm in its mysterious wisdom decided to play some Josquin for me, who I also had never heard of. They both have &quot;Deploration&quot; pieces, and now I&#039;m obsessed with both of them.

And then today the NY Times had something about Josquin. Now he&#039;s everywhere!]]></description>

  Brian Eno said that he’d been listening to a radio station on the internet, based somewhere deep in rural Russia, that plays nothing but Eastern Orthodox chants 24 hours a day, with no announcements. He said that this sort of music appealed to him while locked down at home.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Reminds me of an interview in which he said that the most interesting application of electronic computers were screen savers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[By coincidence, an article on Josquin today:

&#8226; Zachary Woolfe, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/29/arts/music/josquin-des-prez-classical-music.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;The Renaissance’s most influential composer, 500 years later&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;, 29 April 2021.

The 500th anniversary of Josquin&#039;s death will be in August this year, and here Zachary Woolfe interviews the leader of the Tallis Scholars about Josquin&#039;s music.

A quote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  He did take some very good tunes, that’s the first thing. So, in addition to his own good tunes, he was basing his music on very good past material. But then he felt it was his job to disguise the borrowing—embedding the original material in the counterpoint, which can make it quite hard or even impossible to hear. And sometimes he elongates the note lengths so, again, you can’t really follow them. And sometimes he writes wacky canons so that the material gets all jumbled up. I mean, he’s a mathematician at heart. A magician-mathematician.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>
