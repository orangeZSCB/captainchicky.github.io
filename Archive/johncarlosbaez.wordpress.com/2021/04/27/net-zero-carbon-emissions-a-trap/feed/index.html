&lt;em&gt;Here you are talking biodiversity not being good, for some goal that we humans have formulated, namely carbon capture.&lt;/em&gt;

Well, yes, that&#039;s an interesting aspect, but old growth forests are climax ecosystems in many other respects, and offer ecosystem services to many other creatures.  In addition to be susceptible to disturbance by people, they are susceptible to wildfires, assuming conditions are dry enough.

I look forward to my stained T-shirt.

Here you are talking biodiversity not being good, for some goal that we humans have formulated, namely carbon capture.   Clearly there are lots of goals we have where biodiversity counts as not good: e.g. agriculture is about deliberately reducing the biodiversity on a plot of land to increase production of certain species we want.  What I&#039;m mainly interested in is when and how biodiversity is &quot;good for the ecosystem itself&quot; --- and especially, what the quoted phrase even means.

In your example one can claim increased biodiversity in the short term leads to more CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the air and thus reduced biodiversity in the longer run.   There must be other examples like this.]]></description>

John,

Congrats on your retirement!  As a colleague and friend told me when I announced mine, &quot;Your teeshirt with assorted stains on it will be arriving in the mails.&quot;

Regarding biodiversity, not all increases in biodiversity are good.  Particular communities of mycorrhizal fungi cooperate with trees to sequester the bulk of Carbon in soils as forests become old growth:

Ullah, S., B. Muhammad, R. Amin, H. Abbas, and M. Muneer. &quot;Sensitivity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in old-growth forests: Direct effect on growth and soil carbon storage.&quot; Appl. Ecol. Environ. Res 17 (2019): 13749-13758.

Unfortunately, as reported recently in

Tatsumi, Shinichi, Shunsuke Matsuoka, Saori Fujii, Kobayashi Makoto, Takashi Osono, Forest Isbell, and Akira S. Mori. &quot;Prolonged impacts of past agriculture and ungulate overabundance on soil fungal communities in restored forests.&quot; Environmental DNA (2021).

if land has been used for agriculture or grazing for extended periods, the fungi in soils diversify and even once new forests are established the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi have difficulty getting re-established.  Such forests won&#039;t sequester Carbon in soils well for a long time.  Forests apparently need &lt;em&gt;low&lt;/em&gt; fungi biodiversity soils in order to stock Carbon well there.  This may explain why old growth forests per hectare are better at sequestration in soils than young ones.

Luyssaert, Sebastiaan, E-Detlef Schulze, Annett Börner, Alexander Knohl, Dominik Hessenmöller, Beverly E. Law, Philippe Ciais, and John Grace. &quot;Old-growth forests as global carbon sinks.&quot; Nature 455, no. 7210 (2008): 213-215.

Regarding,

&lt;em&gt;What people can see more easily than atmosphere is terrestrial fragmentation of systems – biodiversity loss, pollution, and so on&lt;/em&gt;

I know my thought is a bit heretical, but there is a perspective which suggests the fragmentation and biodiversity loss is simply an dynamic which is moving away from the ecological structures people have long known and quite possibly depend upon for ecological services.  In fact, it&#039;s not like Earth or its ecosystems are being sterilized, it&#039;s that there&#039;s a rotation in make-up going on, driven by human disturbance and pollution.  While the language and attitude regarding &quot;invasive species&quot; is established, even in some law and regulation, there is another perspective which suggests these species are simply those which can thrive in a human-disturbed and human-polluted biosphere.

It could be we don&#039;t like and won&#039;t like where these phenophase changes equilibrate, but it is an ecological equilibrium.

One of the best sources for this new thinking is urban ecology and botany, and the study of weeds.  An article which discussed this is Professor Peter Del Tredici&#039;s &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://placesjournal.org/article/the-flora-of-the-future/?cn-reloaded=1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;The flora of the future&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;]]></description>

Thanks for the article. I only read your extracts - I get the gist, though, I think: scientists are complicit in the greenwash that suits governments because it means business can go on more or less as usual. We have a fundamental problem here. Scientists do indeed need to speak out, but I&#039;d suggest that changing the frame of reference would help. Talking about a climate emergency, for instance, is polarising: there are still people who don&#039;t believe that we&#039;re heading for the stick part of the hockey stick curve. Exponential growth isn&#039;t something we understand easily and unless you&#039;re getting sick, or you can see the smog, you don&#039;t worry too much about air quality. (Fang Fang frequently mentions how shit the air quality is in Wuhan, by the way, which means lots of people were more likely to get sick with the virus, having compromised respiratory conditions to begin with, but that&#039;s another story.) What people can see more easily than atmosphere is terrestrial fragmentation of systems - biodiversity loss, pollution, and so on. There&#039;s a third element - the polarisation of attitudes - that I think needs to be included in the same metric. Let&#039;s call all this &quot;the ecological emergency&quot; (Tim Morton&#039;s phrase but he means something slightly different). And in considering this, consider how we respond to the emergence into our own awareness of the fragmentation of systems, internal and external, the integrity of which we require for our own survival. If we consider the ecological emergency, we avoid the kind of conflict you describe here: &quot;Environmental groups disagree about whether the 145-mile (233 kilometer) corridor comes at too high a cost in loss of trees and wildlife habitat.&quot;

As to the nuclear question, there is the problem of attitude fragmentation again. How do we address this? As a non-dualist, I&#039;d say we change nothing if we don&#039;t change the self. The first thing, then, is to look at our own attitude: dialectical discussion is no longer useful. We need to realise, fast, that there&#039;s no &#039;us&#039; over here as the saints and &#039;them&#039; over there as the sinners. We are all on the spectrum of cooperation and competition, exploitation and altruism. What if we changed the way we talk about this and really looked for common ground? What if we realise that this is the most important conversation we are ever going to have, this conversation about how each of us, individually, can contribute to the future of the species, and in particular to its capacity to curb its apocalyptic powers and work to generate a world view that sees us as a part of rather than apart from the rest of existence.

I won&#039;t go on. I&#039;ve contributed to a book: Urgent Matters, philosophy as practice in the ecological emergency, which I would be very interested for you to read and comment on when it comes out in a couple of months. Thanks, as ever, for your work. All of you.]]></description>

<p>Thanks for the article. I only read your extracts &#8211; I get the gist, though, I think: scientists are complicit in the greenwash that suits governments because it means business can go on more or less as usual. We have a fundamental problem here. Scientists do indeed need to speak out, but I&#8217;d suggest that changing the frame of reference would help. Talking about a climate emergency, for instance, is polarising: there are still people who don&#8217;t believe that we&#8217;re heading for the stick part of the hockey stick curve. Exponential growth isn&#8217;t something we understand easily and unless you&#8217;re getting sick, or you can see the smog, you don&#8217;t worry too much about air quality. (Fang Fang frequently mentions how shit the air quality is in Wuhan, by the way, which means lots of people were more likely to get sick with the virus, having compromised respiratory conditions to begin with, but that&#8217;s another story.) What people can see more easily than atmosphere is terrestrial fragmentation of systems &#8211; biodiversity loss, pollution, and so on. There&#8217;s a third element &#8211; the polarisation of attitudes &#8211; that I think needs to be included in the same metric. Let&#8217;s call all this &#8220;the ecological emergency&#8221; (Tim Morton&#8217;s phrase but he means something slightly different). And in considering this, consider how we respond to the emergence into our own awareness of the fragmentation of systems, internal and external, the integrity of which we require for our own survival.

I think the problem with nuclear is the slow pace of roll out. China aggressively supports it, but it will only play a small role until 2050, and certainly won&#039;t be able to replace the coal plants that need replacing (before their end of useful life) in the next decade or two. Given the demonstrated engineering capacity of China in rolling out high-speed rail, I don&#039;t think any other country will come close to their pace with nuclear. 
   The international community has to find a way to stop burning fossil fuels within a decade or two, and start addressing other sources of greenhouse gas emissions like cement, steel and agriculture. Nuclear (including small modular reactors), and negative emission technologies may scale up to be useful in the 2070s timeframe, but the world has to solve the emissions problem before that. I&#039;m not even sure if green hydrogen or liquid air grid-scale energy storage can scale up in time to prevent tipping points like thawing permafrost (and methane release) and melting glaciers that will take centuries or millenia to come back. And the technologies for green hydrogen and liquid air storage are mature, with ongoing production capacity in many countries for other industrial use cases.
    I understand that peak coal was 2013, but peak oil and peak gas are still far away. An in fact, many new coal plants are in the production pipeline, and also natural gas plants. I wish the world would put in the carbon pricing to make those projects uneconomic, but it would probably have to come up with a massive energy investment fund to plug the gaps in energy supply that those plants were intended to fill. It would be nice if the investment fund could propose a counter-investment to every planned fossil fuel plant, and build something on the planned sites to ensure that they never get built.]]></description>
