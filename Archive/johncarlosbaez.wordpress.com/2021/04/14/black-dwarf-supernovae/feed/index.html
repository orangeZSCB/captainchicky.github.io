					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2021/04/14/black-dwarf-supernovae/#comment-170560&quot;&gt;John Baez&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Probably not, but the question is too vague. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

By quantized space-time I had mostly in mind the replacement of the algebra of commutative functions on a &quot;phase-space&quot; by a non-commutative algebra and its representations.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The general problem of comment-box conversations is even more difficult with topics like the multiverse, where there are actually several similar but quite distinct ideas. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yes, I agree.
It seems a quantized space-time would be classified as a multiverse if one makes further assumptions about the &quot;existence of quantum states&quot;, like in particular if - I understand &#060;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MultiverseWikipedia correctly- if one adopts the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Many-worlds interpretation.&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; I recommend Max Tegmark’s Our Mathematical Universe, which is mostly about different types of multiverses. Even if you don’t agree with Max on all points, he himself is consistent and clear and it is a good introduction to the topic.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thanks for the recommendation. Yes I had seen that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Tegmark&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Max Tegmark&lt;/a&gt; is a distinguished scientist. Wikipedia writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;He was awarded the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Science&#039;s Gold Medal in 2019 for, according to the citation, &quot;his contributions to our understanding of humanity’s place in the cosmos and the opportunities and risks associated with artificial intelligence. He has courageously tackled these existential questions in his research and, in a commendable way, succeeded in communicating the issues to a wider public.&quot; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Unfortunately I think I have not enough time for reading about multiverses. I just wanted to confirm my understanding about the terminology that is involved with quantum gravity approaches.]]></description>

Phillip - since you seem to understand the multiverse discussion - would a quantized space-time also count as a &quot;multiverse&quot;?]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  At the time, that was not testable, but it is now.  The multiverse is in a similar status.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One difference is that it&#039;s easier to look around inside the universe than to look around at different universes.

Anyway, I&#039;m very uninterested in the topic of the multiverse, so I should probably have not responded.   I would much rather talk about Schur functors, the polyphony of Ockeghem, how plants respond to an excess of magnesium in the ground water, or any number of other topics.]]></description>

True, but some very prominent physicists think that it is a very important idea.

Hundreds of years ago, someone not believing in divine intervention might have wondered why the Earth is just at the right distance from the Sun for life to exist.  Claiming that stars are also suns and have planets at more or less random distances solves the problem.  At the time, that was not testable, but it is now.

The multiverse is in a similar status.

(To be sure, there are some who claim that the multiverse follows from other theories.  If true, then it doesn’t have to be testable directly; we believe what GR says happens inside black holes, for instance.  However, those theories such as eternal inflation which more or less predict a multiverse are themselves somewhat speculative.)]]></description>

I don&#039;t think &quot;the common belief is more towards a multiverse&quot;.    A lot of good physicists think the multiverse idea is untestable and not really scientific.

But anyway: in sufficently diverse multiverse, anything whatsoever can happen.]]></description>

This assumes a single universe.  Today the common belief is more towards a multiverse which would change this completely.  What changes may be seen in a multiverse?]]></description>

Yes.  And another question: what would it even &lt;em&gt;mean&lt;/em&gt; to &quot;know you are a Boltzmann brain&quot; or &quot;know you are not a Boltzmann brain&quot;?]]></description>
