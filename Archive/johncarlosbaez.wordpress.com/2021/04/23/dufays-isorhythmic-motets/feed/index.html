Thanks!  I&#039;m definitely interested in Renaissance music; you could say I&#039;m trying to understand (and of course enjoy) the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-Flemish_School#Development&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Franco-Flemish school&lt;/a&gt; of polyphony, that starts roughly with Du Fay and then goes through Ockeghem, Obrecht, Josquin, Manchicourt and Lassus---and others.  This school started around 1420 and ended around 1620, so there were a lot of changes.  I haven&#039;t listened to anything by Richafort yet!

I should probably get ahold of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huelgas_Ensemble#Discography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;everything by the Huelgas Ensemble&lt;/a&gt;, but I&#039;m not quite serious enough to buy it all at once!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi John,
Thank you so much for this wonderful discovery. If you&#039;re interested in Renaissance music as well, I would definitely recommend Richafort&#039;s &quot;Requiem in memoriam Josquin Desprez&quot; (also performed by the Huelgas ensemble):

[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjapCYws3M8&amp;w=460&amp;h=315]

if you haven&#039;t heard of it already. It is a marvellous thing -- and one that I would say also has deep mathematical resonances (although that&#039;s just my uninformed impression, I haven&#039;t read on the subject).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks!  I&#039;ll start by reading that booklet by Guido Magnano when I get my copy of &lt;em&gt;Quadrivium&lt;/em&gt; in the mail, and see how much my interest is piqued.

By the way, it turns out Magnano is the one who uploaded &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isorhythm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;this example of isorhythmic composition&lt;/a&gt; to the Italian Wikipedia:

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s more about architectural systems of mathematical proportion than musical, but you might want to check out Rudolf Wittkower&#039;s &quot;Architectural Principles in the Age of Humanism&quot;.  I think over the years acceptance of his thesis has waxed and waned, not sure how it&#039;s taken these days.]]></description>
