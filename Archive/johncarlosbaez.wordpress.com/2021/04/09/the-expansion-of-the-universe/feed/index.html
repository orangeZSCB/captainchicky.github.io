The concept of &quot;gravitationally bound&quot; has a useful meaning for systems like galaxies, galactic clusters etc., though it&#039;s true that a bound system can become unbound in a collision.   For example, if another galaxy cluster whizzed past the Local Group, the galaxies in this group could cease to be bound.  But this happens rarely enough that &quot;gravitationally bound&quot; is a sensible concept.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  The problem comes with potential/kinetic energy. As the cosmological constant increases the space between things, it must exert a force because potential energy increases the further away things are and as the relative velocity increases, so does the kinetic energy.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That&#039;s not how the cosmological constant works; you&#039;re blending Newtonian physics and general relativity in an incorrect way.

Also: the cosmological constant does not increase with time.   The density of dark energy &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; increase with time, and there are some &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Rip&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;very speculative theories where it does&lt;/a&gt;, but in plain old general relativity with cosmological constant, as used in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM_model&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;usual &#923;CDM model of cosmology&lt;/a&gt;, the density of dark energy is constant.]]></description>

It’s fine to call it the Hubble parameter, but not because that should be used because the term Hubble constant is somehow wrong.  In particular, using the term “parameter” for the Hubble constant as a function of time is close to the “not even wrong” category with regard to the history of cosmology.]]></description>

The cosmological constant does not increase over time.  That’s why it’s the cosmological &lt;i&gt;constant&lt;/i&gt;.  Some people have come up with some ideas for types of “dark energy” (a really bad name; as Sean Carroll points out, everything has energy and many things are dark; sadly, his “smooth tension” never caught on) which do increase with time, leading to the “big rip” you described, but that is not the case with the traditional cosmological constant.

(Note that the Hubble constant is not called that because it is constant in time, but rather because it is the constant in an equation like $latex a$ is a constant in $latex y=ax+b$.  That holds at any one time, but in general $latex H$ can change with time.  Anyone who writes something like Hubble “constant” or calls it the Hubble “parameter” is showing a profound ignorance of the history of cosmology.)]]></description>

I &#039;bookmarked&#039; the paper but i&#039;d have to look it up---it was on arxiv and i may have misinterpreted it.

(it was also reported on media like phys.org--and other physicists said it was wrong--it was a different interpretation of astronomical data.   it may have dealt with (nonexistance of) dark matter/energy.   I interpreted it as similar to Mandelbrot&#039;s view of Olber&#039;s paradox (which i only read about on wikipedia though i did try to read some of mandelbrot&#039;s books.)   It was by a physicist (or group) affiliated with Oxford (or maybe Cambridge or some other UK university like UCL).

To me, there are different kinds of dissident or alternative theories---i might say heisenberg&#039;s matrix mechanics , wave and bohmian  mechanics are alternatives (or interpretations) --stochastic electrodynamics (eg Timothy Boyer) skirts the edge between alternative and &#039;crackpot&#039;.  a &#039;dissident&#039; could be an alternative or a crackpot.

My interest in these is somewhat like psychologists and educators who try to understand &#039;abnormal  psychology&#039;  or why certain math problems which are thought to be &#039;trivial&#039; some people just can&#039;t seem to solve.    I was and am one of these--its like you are &#039;color blind&#039;. (I also had synthesia and still do to an extent --so i see colors in symbols, hear sounds others dont hear, and see shapes others miss.    This is why at times I can find people&#039;s lost possessions --i found my in laws wedding ring she had been looking for for weeks--i thought it was a shiny piece of trash but showed it to her  ---i sometimes  find flora and fauna people just walk by without noticing. )]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know you didn&#039;t write the paper but I wanted to contest the notion of things being gravitationally bound.  There really isn&#039;t such a thing.  There is gravitational equilibrium... Such as you standing on the earth.  The gravitational force is in equilibrium with the force the ground pushes up on you do you don&#039;t move.  When the moon is overhead, it pulls on you and the ground pushes a little less so you weigh less but the whole system is still in equilibrium and you stay on the ground.  But, if Jupiter came close enough.... It would suck you off the earth. Your not &quot;bound&quot; to the earth. If something were in orbit instead of on the ground... A small force would affect the distance.

The problem comes with potential/kinetic energy.  As the cosmological constant increases the space between things.. it must exert a force because potential energy increases the further away things are and as the relative velocity increases, so does the kinetic energy.  We don&#039;t know where all this energy comes from, thus, dark energy but, energy is a force acting over a distance.

As the cosmological constant increases over time, the force exerted increases and so eventually it will be great enough to overcome our local cluster.  It has already overcome super clusters that would have long ago been classified as &#039;gravitationally bound&quot; and we know they were because that&#039;s how they clustered in the first place.

If the cosmological constant is allowed to increase forever... Eventually it will rip apart galaxies, star systems, planets, and even atoms.]]></description>
