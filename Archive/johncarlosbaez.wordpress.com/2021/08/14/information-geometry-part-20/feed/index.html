Yeah.  Socrates once complained that the problem with books is that you can&#039;t ask a book questions.  But on a blog you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; ask questions --- and other people can read the answers!   This is what I like about blogs.]]></description>

Yes, but they do this when they &lt;em&gt;start&lt;/em&gt; with the coordinates.  Here the coordinates are derived at the end of a series of steps; I think that&amp;apos;s adding to the confusion.  I see why you did it this way, but it is an unusual order to do things.

Anyway, I&amp;apos;m really hoping that people who see these comments might think ‹Ah, that&amp;apos;s why I&amp;apos;m confused, but now I understand.› rather than that you&amp;apos;ll change the notation, especially since I don&#039;t have a natural alternative to suggest.]]></description>

Everyone in differential geometry uses $latex x_i$ as coordinates of a point called $latex x,$  everyone in physics uses $latex q_i$ as coordinates of a position called $latex q,$ etc.    This is confusing when you first see it,  and you might feel tempted to write $latex x_i(x)$ for the coordinate function $latex x_i$ evaluated at the point $latex x.$   But it&#039;s good to get used to.

I&#039;m sorry my exposition seemed convoluted.   Maybe it&#039;s because I was trying to explain two subjects in one blog post: statistical manifolds and thermodynamics.   They&#039;re closely related.   In a statistical manifold each point labels a probability distribution.   In thermodynamics each point of a manifold labels a probability distribution that maximizes entropy subject to constraints on some observables, and the expected values of these observables serve as coordinates.

I didn&#039;t have a whole lot I wanted to say about statistical manifolds this time, except as a lead-in to thermodynamics.   So I just laid out the basic formalism and then took a hard right turn into thermodynamics.   If I ever turn this stuff into a book I&#039;ll try to give the readers a more gentle ride.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It is pretty convoluted; I had to go through it a few times.

I think that it would help to use different symbols for $latex q$ (a point of the manifold $latex Q$) and $latex q_i$ (a coordinate function on $latex Q$).  Because even though $latex q$ can be written as a tuple using the coordinates $latex q_i$, still $latex q$ comes well before $latex q_i$ in the development.]]></description>

  I guess I’m confused about what the $latex q_{i}$ are supposed to be: you defined them starting from $latex A_{i}$ and the distribution, but now you use them to define another distribution.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

No, there&#039;s only one distribution in this story: or more precisely, one map $latex \pi$ sending each point $latex q$ of a manifold $latex Q$ to a probability distribution $latex \pi_q.$

Starting from this and some observables $latex A_1, \dots A_n,$ I defined the function

$latex q_i \colon Q \to \mathbb{R}$

to be the expected value of $latex A_i$ in the distribution $latex \pi_q$:

$latex \displaystyle{ \int_\Omega A_i(x) \pi_q(x) \, d\mu(x) = q_i } $

Then I assumed that the functions $latex q_1, \dots, q_n$ are a coordinate system on $latex Q$ (and I explained why this is easy to achieve).

Then I made a big extra assumption: $latex \pi_q$ is the probability distribution with the &lt;em&gt;largest possible entropy&lt;/em&gt; such that

$latex \displaystyle{ \int_\Omega A_i(x) \pi_q(x) \, d\mu(x) = q_i } $

for all &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;.   In other words: if you tell me the values of the coordinates $latex q_1, \dots, q_n,$ then $latex \pi_q$ is not just any old probability distribution having these values as the expected values of the observables $latex A_1, \dots, A_n.$   It&#039;s the probability distribution with &lt;em&gt;the largest possible entropy&lt;/em&gt; having these values as the expected values of the observables $latex A_1, \dots, A_n.$

I&#039;m not changing $latex \pi_q$ here, I&#039;m just making an extra assumption about it.   This is a common assumption in thermodynamics.

Without this extra assumption there&#039;s nothing very exciting we can do until someone tells us a formula for $latex \pi_q$.   But &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; this extra assumption I can show that $latex \pi_q$ must obey this equation:

$latex \displaystyle{  \pi_q(x) = \frac{1}{Z(q)} \exp\left(-\sum_{i = 1}^n p_i A_i(x)\right) }$

(I defined $latex p_i$ and  $latex Z(q)$ in the post.)

I will actually show this equation next time.

I hope the logic is clearer now.  If there&#039;s something puzzling still, just ask.]]></description>

In other words: if you tell me the values of the coordinates <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q_1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+q_n%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="q_1, &#92;dots, q_n," class="latex" /> then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi_q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;pi_q" class="latex" /> is not just any old probability distribution having these values as the expected values of the observables <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A_1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+A_n.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A_1, &#92;dots, A_n." class="latex" />   It&#8217;s the probability distribution with <em>the largest possible entropy</em> having these values as the expected values of the observables <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A_1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+A_n.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A_1, &#92;dots, A_n." class="latex" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not changing <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi_q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;pi_q" class="latex" /> here, I&#8217;m just making an extra assumption about it.   This is a common assumption in thermodynamics.</p>
<p>Without this extra assumption there&#8217;s nothing very exciting we can do until someone tells us a formula for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi_q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;pi_q" class="latex" />.   But <em>with</em> this extra assumption I can show that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi_q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;pi_q" class="latex" /> must obey this equation:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B++%5Cpi_q%28x%29+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BZ%28q%29%7D+%5Cexp%5Cleft%28-%5Csum_%7Bi+%3D+1%7D%5En+p_i+A_i%28x%29%5Cright%29+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{  &#92;pi_q(x) = &#92;frac{1}{Z(q)} &#92;exp&#92;left(-&#92;sum_{i = 1}^n p_i A_i(x)&#92;right) }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>(I defined <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p_i" class="latex" /> and  <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z%28q%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="Z(q)" class="latex" /> in the post.)</p>
<p>I will actually show this equation next time.</p>
<p>I hope the logic is clearer now.  If there&#8217;s something puzzling still, just ask.</p>

I guess I&#039;m confused about what the q_{i} are supposed to be: you defined them starting from A_{i} and the distribution, but now you use them to define another distribution. So do we assume that we have coordinates q_{i} on Q and observables A_{i} on \Omega already, and then consider probability distributions for which the expectatin of A_{i}  is q_{i}?]]></description>

Hi!  That&#039;s a good question.  I will answer it someday, as I keep discussing the analogy between classical mechanics and information geometry.  There are actually a few different possibilities, depending on what we take as the analogue of time.]]></description>
