					<description><![CDATA[It is fun to consider adiabatic expansion in a &lt;em&gt;rocket&lt;/em&gt;, where the work does convert to displacing a piston, but to kinetic energy of the gas.
On an atomic scale, all energy remains in the form of kinetic energy of the atoms, but the kinetic energy goes from random motion to all in the same direction.
To make a rocket, we can imagine connecting the gas to a long tube, with the open end of the tube far away at vacuum. To simplify things, we make the container very heavy, so that the kinetic energy that is “lost” to the space ship is negligible. (The designers of the rocket would define “loss” in the opposite sense!) Note that we could always reconvert the kinetic energy into other forms by colliding the rocket jet with some turbine blades.
Although the total kinetic energy of the atoms remains constant, we can expand until the temperature (a measure of the random component of kinetic energy), becomes almost zero. Where does all the entropy go? To the larger volume that the gas occupies! The volume of phase space remains constant during the expansion.
The higher the dimension of space, the faster the velocity of the rocket gas, because the kinetic energy of the other directions get focused into the direction of the rocket.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2021/07/15/the-ideal-monatomic-gas/#comment-171057&quot;&gt;Wei-Xiang Feng&lt;/a&gt;.

Perhaps it is not so relevant to this topic. The adiabatic index is crucial to explain why black hole can form automatically from a self-gravitating monatomic fluid (or gas) sphere if it is sufficiently relativistic in (3+1).

To determine the stability of a self-gravitating fluid sphere, one has to perturb the equilibrium solution and obtain the so-called radial pulsation equation. In order to check the instability, we need to know the compressibility of the fluid, which is characterized by the adiabatic index of the fluid, $latex \gamma$ from $latex P\sim V^{-\gamma}$.

In Newtonian gravity, the pulsation equation goes as:
$latex \delta\ddot{R}+\omega^2 \delta R=0$, where $latex \omega$ is the oscillation frequency after the perturbation of the star radius R. And $latex \omega^2 \sim\gamma_{\rm cr}-\langle\gamma\rangle$, where $latex \gamma$ is the average adiabatic index over the whole fluid, the $latex \gamma_{\rm cr}$ is the critical value when the fluid becomes unstable. If $latex \gamma_{\rm cr}&#062;\langle\gamma\rangle$ the perturbation is unstable and we expect it would collapse into a black hole.

Interestingly, $latex \gamma_{cr}=2(1-1/n)$, where $latex n$ is the space dimension. (There is a simple derivation from Misner, Thorne and Wheeler (1973) in (3+1) but it is easy to generalize to (n+1).)

For ideal gas, $latex \gamma$ goes from $latex 1+2/n$ to $latex 1+1/n$ as the velocity dispersion $latex (v/c)$ of the fluid goes from 0 (non-relativistic) to 1 (ultra-relativistic). Solving the inequality, we get $latex n&#060;3$ or $latex n&#060;4$ is the dimension that makes the fluid stable. For example, $latex \gamma_{\rm cr}=4/3$ and $latex 4/3&#060;\gamma&#060;5/3$, it is still too stable in Newtonian context.

However, in GR (from Chandrasekhar 1964), $latex \gamma_{cr}=4/3+$ correction terms of $latex mathcal{O}(v/c)$, that is the reason why in (3+1) the fluid can collapse into a BH if the fluid is sufficiently relativistic.]]></description>

That sounds right.   To understand an adiabat we need to imagine an insulated container of gas expanding.  As it expands, its internal energy goes down like this:

$latex dU = - P dV$

Since

$latex dU = \frac{n}{2} N k dT$

its temperature drops.  But when the number $latex n$ of degrees of freedom of each molecule is huge, it only takes a small change in temperature to create a given change in internal energy.  So as the insulated container expands, the temperature only drops a little.   So in this case, the adiabats are almost isotherms!]]></description>
