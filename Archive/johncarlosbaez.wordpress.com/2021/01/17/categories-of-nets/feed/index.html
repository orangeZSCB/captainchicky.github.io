					<description><![CDATA[Many of our peer bloggers step out to give general advice on science. Some conspicuously often take their advice and recommendations on natural sciences openly national. Others address it within smaller communities, but their ideas can be equally valuable. All may be worthy of consultation.

 Blogs 

The one rule we&#8217;re setting out now is that in order to be advising the advisor, the blogs must stay current. There are tons of terrific blogs that have stopped publishing altogether, or whose last &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; post is many moons ago. As for those who try to be reasonably current, Ken and I know how hard it is to do. So we took a three-week horizon&#8212;that is, who has posted something this year, 2021. That said, here are some of our favorite blogs on math and CS theory&#8212;after the first they are alphabetical by writer(s).

 &lt;a href=&quot;https://terrytao.wordpress.com/tag/model-theory/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;What&#8217;s New&lt;/a&gt; Terence Tao 
The best math blog of all time. If you must read one, then this is the one. If you read two or more math blogs, then this is still the one. If you read two or more posts on this blog, then you qualify as a mathematician.

 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Shtetl Optimized&lt;/a&gt; Scott Aaronson 
Wonderful blog. A brilliant combination of results, comments, and opinions. We have &#8220;encoded&#8221; his name in the previous section&#8212;see if you can spot where and how.

 &lt;a href=&quot;https://francisbach.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Machine Learning Research Blog&lt;/a&gt; Francis Bach 
Focused on connections between optimization and learning. I conjecture that the key to solving some of our deep questions&#8212;PNP&#8212;could be resolved by machine-learning technology. I recall a year ago while talking with learning experts at Chicago that they said: We think SAT should have an algorithm that runs in  time for some .

 &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Azimuth&lt;/a&gt; John Carlos Baez 
Often goes into physics and policy, such as today&#8217;s third &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2021/01/21/us-environmental-policy-part-3/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; in a series on environmental policy and climate change. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2021/01/17/categories-of-nets/&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2021/01/20/categories-of-nets-part-2/&quot;&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; were on Petri nets and higher abstractions of them.

 &lt;a href=&quot;https://windowsontheory.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Windows on Theory&lt;/a&gt; Boaz Barak 
This was originally a joint blog by researchers at the Microsoft Silicon Valley Research Center before it &lt;a href=&quot;https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2014/09/27/microsoft-closes-svc/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;closed&lt;/a&gt; in 2014. Last week&#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://windowsontheory.org/2021/01/15/ml-theory-with-bad-drawings/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; is also on machine learning and theory.

 &lt;a href=&quot;https://micromath.wordpress.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Mathematics under the Microscope&lt;/a&gt; Alexandre Borovik 
See his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openbookpublishers.com/10.11647/OBP.0168.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; with Tony Gardiner, &lt;em&gt;The Essence of Mathematics&lt;/em&gt;. The spirit of the book is seen in this quote from George P&#243;lya: &lt;i&gt;It is better to solve one problem in five different ways than to solve five problems in one way.&lt;/i&gt;

 &lt;a href=&quot;https://agtb.wordpress.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Turing&#8217;s Invisible Hand&lt;/a&gt; Felix Brandt, Michal Feldman, Jason Hartline, Bobby Kleinberg, Kevin Leyton-Brown, Noam Nisan, Vijay Vazirani 
They have an annotated version of John Nash&#8217;s 1955 &lt;a href=&quot;https://agtb.wordpress.com/2012/02/17/john-nashs-letter-to-the-nsa/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; to the NSA about the complexity of crypto, which beat Kurt G&#246;del&#8217;s &#8220;lost letter&#8221; by a whole year. As we &lt;a href=&quot;https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/04/01/introducing-techplex-com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;joked&lt;/a&gt; on 4/1/12, if we had known about it, GLL would have been NLL.

 &lt;a href=&quot;https://cameroncounts.wordpress.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Peter Cameron&#8217; Blog&lt;/a&gt; Peter Cameron 
This is where I found out about the appointment of Lander to Biden&#8217;s cabinet. Peter is at St. Andrews and emeritus from Queen Mary University of London. Ken wrote about him in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2021/01/01/peter-m-neumann-1940-2020/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;memorial&lt;/a&gt; for Peter Neumann.

 &lt;a href=&quot;https://quomodocumque.wordpress.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Quomodocumque&lt;/a&gt; Jordan Ellenberg 
He &lt;a href=&quot;https://quomodocumque.wordpress.com/2021/01/15/am-i-supposed-to-say-something-about-the-invasion-of-the-united-states-capitol/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;asks&lt;/a&gt;: Am I Supposed To Say Something About The Invasion Of The United States Capitol? He does. We haven&#8217;t. (We are mulling a post on quantitative matters from the pandemic and election that have become political footballs.)

 &lt;a href=&quot;https://11011110.github.io/blog/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;11011110&lt;/a&gt; David Eppstein&#8212;the blog name is his initials DE in hexadecimal and his surname has a double-p.
Right now he has a wonderful &lt;a href=&quot;https://11011110.github.io/blog/2021/01/15/linkage.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; of open questions and known results. For example there is a discussion of USA flag arrangements, and also the recent claimed solution of an almost 50 year old conjecture: A proof of the Erd&#337;s-Faber-L&#243;vasz &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04698&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;conjecture&lt;/a&gt; by Dong Yeap Kang, Tom Kelly, Daniela Kuhn, Abhishek Methuku, Deryk Osthus.

 &lt;a href=&quot;https://explainingmaths.wordpress.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Explaining mathematics&lt;/a&gt; Joel Feinstein 
He asks: When proving there exists statements, is it enough to give just one example or do you have to prove it using the definitions, and so on? &lt;a href=&quot;https://explainingmaths.wordpress.com/2021/01/09/proving-there-exists-statements/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Read on&lt;/a&gt; for more.

 &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Computational Complexity&lt;/a&gt; Lance Fortnow and Bill Gasarch 
The CS theory blog that started it all. Continues to be one of the top blogs. Lance&#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/01/the-ethics-board.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday says that &#8220;the way of most suggestions I make in my blog [is] a quick road to nowhere,&#8221; but the one in that post went somewhere.

 &lt;a href=&quot;http://jdh.hamkins.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;logic and more&lt;/a&gt; Joel Hamkins 
He discusses the math tea argument&#8212;one heard at an afternoon tea. I miss these very much, even though I do not drink tea. The argument is: There must be some real numbers that we cannot define, since there are uncountably many real numbers, but only countably many definitions. Is it correct? &lt;a href=&quot;http://jdh.hamkins.org/definability-and-the-math-tea-argument-warsaw-22-january-2021/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Read on&lt;/a&gt; about the talk he is giving tomorrow &#8220;in&#8221; Warsaw for an explanation.

 &lt;a href=&quot;https://gilkalai.wordpress.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Combinatorics and more&lt;/a&gt; Gil Kalai 
Gil&#8217;s wonderful blog is a great place to see announcements of new results. He&#8217;s had a year-long series, &#8220;To cheer you up in difficult times&#8221;; its 18th &lt;a href=&quot;https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2021/01/19/what-if-they-are-all-wrong/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;installment&lt;/a&gt; links to a wonderful, thoughtful, entertaining, and provocative post by Igor Pak about conjectures. The 17th &lt;a href=&quot;https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2021/01/14/to-cheer-you-up-in-difficult-times-17-amazing-the-erdos-faber-lovasz-conjecture-for-large-n-was-proved-by-dong-yeap-kang-tom-kelly-daniela-kuhn-abhishek-methuku-and-deryk-osthus/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;installment&lt;/a&gt; was about the Erd&#337;s-Faber-L&#243;vasz news.

 &lt;a href=&quot;http://m-phi.blogspot.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;M-Phi&lt;/a&gt; Many authors 
All of the recent entries have been by Richard Pettigrew but they have a long list of previous contributors. The recent posts catch Ken&#8217;s eye because they employ the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brier_score&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Brier score&lt;/a&gt; to reason philosophically about inaccuracy. Ken has employed his group&#8217;s novel &lt;a href=&quot;https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/11/29/predicating-predictivity/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;adaptation&lt;/a&gt; of the Brier score in chess cheating cases all through the pandemic.

 &lt;a href=&quot;https://dustingmixon.wordpress.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Short, Fat Matrices&lt;/a&gt; Dustin Mixon 
He discusses a problem by Mario Krenn. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://mariokrenn.wordpress.com/graph-theory-question/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;problem&lt;/a&gt; has consequences for quantum computation&#8212;and comes with cash prizes&#8212;one is &#8364;3,000.

 &lt;a href=&quot;https://vzn1.wordpress.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Turing Machine&lt;/a&gt; VZN 
Just nipped under with a New Year&#8217;s Day &lt;a href=&quot;https://vzn1.wordpress.com/2021/01/01/collatz-search-for-overarching-strategy/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on the Collatz  conjecture.  Ken used to know VZN&#8217;s full name but can&#8217;t find it now.

 &lt;a href=&quot;https://noncommutativeanalysis.wordpress.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Noncommutative Analysis&lt;/a&gt; Orr Shalit 
The issues here are important to quantum computation, since for operators  and ,  is usually not true.

 &lt;a href=&quot;https://lucatrevisan.wordpress.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;in theory&lt;/a&gt; Luca Trevisan 
The only theory blog&#8212;I believe&#8212;that quotes Homer Simpson: &#8220;Marge, I agree with you&#8212;in theory. In theory, communism works. In theory.&#8221;

 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Not Even Wrong&lt;/a&gt; Peter Woit 
Mathematical physics, for the most part, growing out from his 2005 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Not-Even-Wrong-Failure-Physical/dp/0465092764&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; of that title critiquing string theory.

We also link to sites such as John Awbrey&#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://inquiryintoinquiry.com/about/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Inquiry Into Inquiry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://pinkiguana2.wordpress.com/news/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Pink Iguana&lt;/a&gt; that grow in beehive style, and sites with higher-volume politics and culture content such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://priorprobability.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;prior probability&lt;/a&gt; by Enrique Guerra-Pujol.

 Open Problems 

We would be grateful for suggestions of additional mathematics and computing blogs that an advisor&#8217;s staff might consult.]]></description>

<p>We also link to sites such as John Awbrey&#8217;s <a href="https://inquiryintoinquiry.com/about/" rel="nofollow ugc">Inquiry Into Inquiry</a> and <a href="https://pinkiguana2.wordpress.com/news/" rel="nofollow ugc">Pink Iguana</a> that grow in beehive style, and sites with higher-volume politics and culture content such as <a href="https://priorprobability.com/" rel="nofollow ugc">prior probability</a> by Enrique Guerra-Pujol.</p>
<p> Open Problems </p>
<p>We would be grateful for suggestions of additional mathematics and computing blogs that an advisor&#8217;s staff might consult.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[If you forced the action of even permutations to be the identity would you get a sort of pre-fermionic system?

Would describing the transition function of conservative cellular automata as a _-net be useful? I guess the _-monoidal category would be a sort of &quot;macroscopic&quot; view? I wonder what CS-comonad-like functor that goes from local to global transitions looks like in this context.]]></description>
