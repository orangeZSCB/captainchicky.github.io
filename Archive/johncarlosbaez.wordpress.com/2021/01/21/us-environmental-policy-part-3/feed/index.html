The following is relevant and may be of interest:

&quot;For years, opposition from corporations helped prevent any carbon pricing plans from gaining traction in Congress, but now the business lobby has changed its tune. The American Petroleum Institute, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, National Association of Manufacturers and American Chemistry Council have all endorsed carbon pricing as a means of controlling emissions. And all say they are actively lobbying Congress to adopt a pricing scheme. So far, however, they have little to show for the effort.

“All this work and time and energy has been put into getting the business community to the table, and we are now. And nobody wants to do it anymore,” said Ross Eisenberg, vice president of federal affairs at the American Chemistry Council.

The Climate Leadership Council, whose members include Ford, BP, Exxon Mobil and Shell, says it received positive responses from Republicans after circulating a report framing the issue as one of U.S. economic competitiveness. That document found the U.S. would benefit from a border-adjustable carbon tax in part because American-manufactured goods are 80 percent more carbon efficient than the world average.

The Alliance for Market Solutions, which advocates for carbon pricing, this week launched a new advocacy push, seeded with a high six-figure investment from Dow Chemical and Exxon Mobil, for carbon pricing on Capitol Hill, according to its executive director Alex Flint.

...

The Northeast’s RGGI, originally championed by Republican New York Gov. George Pataki, has by most metrics been successful at reducing emissions in member states, which numbered 11 after Virginia joined last year. Studies give RGGI at least partial credit for lowering power emissions, which have nearly been cut in half, helped by cheap natural gas supplanting coal-fired power plants.&quot;

The article says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  Exxon is not asking for direct federal subsidies but is urging the administration to help kick-start the effort, either through tax breaks to create incentives for the technology or by establishing a price on carbon that will help create a market for the company&#039;s new business of capturing the emissions.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I sure wish the government would put a price on carbon!   Tax breaks for specific technologies amounts to an attempt to guess which will work best.

Carbon sequestration could be really important.  Much as it galls me, I can imagine Exxon becoming a leader in this area.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Many of our peer bloggers step out to give general advice on science. Some conspicuously often take their advice and recommendations on natural sciences openly national. Others address it within smaller communities, but their ideas can be equally valuable. All may be worthy of consultation.

&lt;h4&gt; Blogs &lt;/h4&gt;

The one rule we&#8217;re setting out now is that in order to be advising the advisor, the blogs must stay current. There are tons of terrific blogs that have stopped publishing altogether, or whose last &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; post is many moons ago. As for those who try to be reasonably current, Ken and I know how hard it is to do. So we took a three-week horizon&#8212;that is, who has posted something this year, 2021. That said, here are some of our favorite blogs on math and CS theory&#8212;after the first they are alphabetical by writer(s).

&lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&quot; alt=&quot;{&#092;bullet }&quot; title=&quot;{&#092;bullet }&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://terrytao.wordpress.com/tag/model-theory/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;What&#8217;s New&lt;/a&gt; Terence Tao &lt;br /&gt;
The best math blog of all time. If you must read one, then this is the one. If you read two or more math blogs, then this is still the one. If you read two or more posts on this blog, then you qualify as a mathematician.

&lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&quot; alt=&quot;{&#092;bullet }&quot; title=&quot;{&#092;bullet }&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Shtetl Optimized&lt;/a&gt; Scott Aaronson &lt;br /&gt;
Wonderful blog. A brilliant combination of results, comments, and opinions. We have &#8220;encoded&#8221; his name in the previous section&#8212;see if you can spot where and how.

&lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&quot; alt=&quot;{&#092;bullet }&quot; title=&quot;{&#092;bullet }&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://francisbach.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Machine Learning Research Blog&lt;/a&gt; Francis Bach &lt;br /&gt;
Focused on connections between optimization and learning. I conjecture that the key to solving some of our deep questions&#8212;P&lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%3C%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&quot; alt=&quot;{&#060;}&quot; title=&quot;{&#060;}&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt;NP&#8212;could be resolved by machine-learning technology. I recall a year ago while talking with learning experts at Chicago that they said: We think SAT should have an algorithm that runs in &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5E%7Bc%5Csqrt+n%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&quot; alt=&quot;{2^{c&#092;sqrt n}}&quot; title=&quot;{2^{c&#092;sqrt n}}&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; time for some &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&quot; alt=&quot;{c}&quot; title=&quot;{c}&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt;.

&lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&quot; alt=&quot;{&#092;bullet }&quot; title=&quot;{&#092;bullet }&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Azimuth&lt;/a&gt; John Carlos Baez &lt;br /&gt;
Often goes into physics and policy, such as today&#8217;s third &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2021/01/21/us-environmental-policy-part-3/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; in a series on environmental policy and climate change. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2021/01/17/categories-of-nets/&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2021/01/20/categories-of-nets-part-2/&quot;&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; were on Petri nets and higher abstractions of them.

&lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&quot; alt=&quot;{&#092;bullet}&quot; title=&quot;{&#092;bullet}&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://windowsontheory.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Windows on Theory&lt;/a&gt; Boaz Barak &lt;br /&gt;

Last week&#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://windowsontheory.org/2021/01/15/ml-theory-with-bad-drawings/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; is also on machine learning and theory.

The spirit of the book is seen in this quote from George P&#243;lya: &lt;i&gt;It is better to solve one problem in five different ways than to solve five problems in one way.&lt;/i&gt;

We would be grateful for suggestions of additional mathematics and computing blogs that an advisor&#8217;s staff might consult.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many of our peer bloggers step out to give general advice on science. Some conspicuously often take their advice and recommendations on natural sciences openly national. Others address it within smaller communities, but their ideas can be equally valuable. All may be worthy of consultation.</p>
<h4> Blogs </h4>
<p>The one rule we&#8217;re setting out now is that in order to be advising the advisor, the blogs must stay current. There are tons of terrific blogs that have stopped publishing altogether, or whose last <em>new</em> post is many moons ago. As for those who try to be reasonably current, Ken and I know how hard it is to do. So we took a three-week horizon&#8212;that is, who has posted something this year, 2021. That said, here are some of our favorite blogs on math and CS theory&#8212;after the first they are alphabetical by writer(s).</p>
