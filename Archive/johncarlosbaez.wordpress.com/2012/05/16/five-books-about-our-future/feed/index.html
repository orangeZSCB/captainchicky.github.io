Yeah, that wasn&#039;t very rigorous. But I couldn&#039;t help. I&#039;ve contracted a Singularity allergy late last century. And meanwhile we&#039;ve indeed reached a singular moment in the history of Life: One single species overshot the carrying capacity of a whole planet. Yet folks keep dreaming of deathless minds.

Here&#039;s a quick argument for its impossibility: Forget Descartes&#039; split of the world into res extensa and res cogitans - Biology shows that mind cannot exist without matter. As long as you can&#039;t simulate life in silico (incl. metabolic closure) you can&#039;t simulate mind in silico. 

True artificial intelligence would prove Descartes right (for the artificial mind could run on any computer, and transmigrate from one machine to another machine, thus is independent of matter). Thus, AI is a religious metaphysical dream that&#039;s highly implausible.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Changing areas of emphasis? Maybe you should have a look at Singularity University (I understand Ray Kurzweil teaches there). 

As for books about the future. I recommend you choose among the five books,one book about picturing the future (I mean about the tools and practices of the futurists) such as Foresight: The art and science of anticipating the future by Dennis Loverridge. There are many more I can recommend to you.

Another book to consider, along the same lines in your list, is Future Imperfect: Technology and Freedom in an Uncertain World by David Friedman (a physicist-PhD, Chicago- turned economist and now a professor of Law at Santa Clara University).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I once read &lt;i&gt;A Many-Colored Glass, Reflections on the Place of Life in the Universe&lt;/i&gt; by Freeman Dyson (2007, University of Virginia Press).  It is based on a set of lectures the author gave at the University of Virginia in 2004. 

In the book, Dyson digresses on various topics, ranging from biotechnology, climate change to a (serious) debate on if life can go on forever.

I had good fun. Dyson is a very clever chap!]]></description>

John wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;And I think you guys have convinced me not to bother with Kurzweil, unless you think it would be useful to anyone for me to write a blistering critique. Do people on Five Books ever rip a book to shreds? I don’t know. I doubt it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As Anton Ego says in &lt;i&gt;Ratatouille,&lt;/i&gt; blistering negative criticism is fun to read and to write.  I&#039;ve certainly read some remarkably entertaining negative reviews.  Some, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000844.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Geoff Pullum&#039;s reaction to &lt;i&gt;The Da Vinci Code&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, could become spoken-word performance pieces.  But championing a &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; book &#8212; or two or five &#8212; might be even better!

On the subject of looking at old predictions:

Douglas Adams (of &lt;i&gt;Hitchhiker&#039;s Guide to the Galaxy&lt;/i&gt; fame) and John Lloyd wrote a book, &lt;i&gt;The Meaning of Liff,&lt;/i&gt; in which they repurposed place names to provide words for things which should have them but didn&#039;t.  One of the more useful is &lt;i&gt;zeerust,&lt;/i&gt; originally a town in South Africa, but now adopted to mean

&lt;blockquote&gt;the particular kind of datedness which afflicts things that were originally designed to look futuristic.&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Against Kurzeil, here are 3 of the best books on human evolutionary biology:

&lt;i&gt;Too Smart for Our Own Good - The Ecological Predicament of Humankind&lt;/i&gt; by Craig Dilworth (reviewed by &lt;a href=&quot;http://questioneverything.typepad.com/question_everything/2012/02/what-is-a-smart-species-like-us-doing-in-a-predicament-like-this.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;George Mobus&lt;/a&gt;). It explains the evolution of mankind (in ample detail and 1755 references to literature) in terms of a &quot;vicious circle principle&quot;: Population pressure begets innovation begets population pressure. Looking at the past, the future looks grim given today&#039;s global population pressure. Dilworth&#039;s conclusion for the future: megadeath.

Another book for guessing future from past is E.O. Wilson&#039;s latest: &lt;i&gt;The Social Conquest of Earth&lt;/i&gt; (Long Now Foundation &lt;a href=&quot;http://longnow.org/seminars/02012/apr/20/social-conquest-earth/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;). It is of utmost importance to understand our dynamics as social animals (e.g. aggression). This has already been stressed by Konrad Lorenz in his 1973 book, &lt;i&gt;Behind the Mirror: A Search for a Natural History of Human Knowledge&lt;/i&gt; (bad translation of the German title). Lorenz and Wilson are more optimistic, given the growing amount of knowledge about not only the world, but also about ourselves.

(Well, I doubt anybody will listen to the experts...)]]></description>
