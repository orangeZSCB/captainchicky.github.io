					<description><![CDATA[A reply to Phillip Helbig:

There do exist journals which are completely open access AND also free to publish in.  

Such journals are mostly very young, and so we shouldn&#039;t be surprised that they aren&#039;t super high prestige.  But their prestige will rise in time.  And if U.S. Government-sponsored research is required to be published open access, and the big journals insist on draconian author fees, then we will see a major exodus, and the young and upcoming new researchers will begin submitting to these 100% free journals.  This will in turn cause these free journals to have a huge rise in prestige.

Basically, it&#039;s like Mike Taylor said.  Open Access creates an actual market with actual competition.  (Closed Access creates monopolies which are very difficult to fight against and ensure that in the big picture, all scientists lose.)]]></description>

&quot;As long as the author pays and the journal makes any profit at all, then there is a conflict of interest: publish more papers, make more money.&quot;

Not when the publisher is a non-profit -- as is the case with PLoS. In any case, publishers have a reputation to consider. No-one wants to publish bad papers.

The problem -- well, one of many -- with the subscription model is that papers are not fungible. If I need to read Naish et al. 2004 on an English brachiosaurid cervical, I &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; to get it from Elsevier&#039;s &lt;i&gt;Cretaceous Research&lt;/i&gt; -- there is no alternative. Whereas in an author-pays OA scenario, authors have freedom to choose a journal &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; readers can pick it up from wherever it lands up.]]></description>

As long as the author pays and the journal makes any profit at all, then there is a conflict of interest: publish more papers, make more money.  This is the one advantage of a subscription model: people will not subscribe if the quality is too low.  In fact, the only reason that overpriced journals can exist is that there is some sort of quality control.  There can be competition with the subscription model as well.  Why doesn&#039;t it work?  Because there is pressure to publish in reputable journals.  I don&#039;t see how a scheme where the author pays changes this.

I think the solution is for professional societies to have journals which would essentially be just a web page with links to &quot;approved&quot; papers on arXiv.  The refereeing would be done by the professional society instead of the publisher.  (Of course, in the end the same people would be refereeing.)  One just needs arXiv to agree to a few small changes (such as having an ombudsman whose word is final and recognized by all to settle any conflicts; of course, he should not be anonymous).]]></description>

(Sequence of replies is getting squeezed up against the margin! I&#039;ll try to keep this short.)

I definitely agree that academic publisher profit margins (between 32% and 42% of revenue for the Big Four) are ridiculous and unsustainable.

But they are already being undercut by open-access publishers such as PLoS (whose $1350 publication fee in PLoS ONE is about 1/4 to 1/8 what it costs the community to publish with Elsevier), and further by new and on-the-way OA publishers like PeerJ ($99 publication fee!)

The point about author-pays open access is that it&#039;s an efficient market: because authors can go elsewhere if a price is too high or service is too poor, publishers will have to compete for papers on price and quality of service. That can only push prices down -- way down.

... But all that is for the future. Right now, the urgent thing is for us all to stand up and say &quot;this is ridiculous: it&#039;s our research, we paid for it, corporations must not be allowed to own it&quot;.

So please &lt;a href=&quot;https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions/#!/petition/require-free-access-over-internet-scientific-journal-articles-arising-taxpayer-funded-research/wDX82FLQ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;sign the petition!&lt;/a&gt; :-)]]></description>

I see your point, but there is the danger that those supporting the author-pays-everything form of open access will use this to create the impression that publishers are also in favour of &quot;open access&quot;, making it more difficult to combat the real problem, which are the too high profits. . . . . .]]></description>

The petition doesn&#039;t get into talking about the means, because the end is more important. The goal here is to sweep away a massive, artificial impediment that dramatically and unnecessarily retards the progress of science, health-care, education, third-world development, industry and much more.  We can (and surely will) discuss in detail &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; this is to be done. But right here and right now, the urgent thing is to resolve &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; it will be done.
