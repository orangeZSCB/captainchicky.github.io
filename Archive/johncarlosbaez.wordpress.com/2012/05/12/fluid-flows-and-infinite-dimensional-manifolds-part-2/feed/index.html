Understood.  It seems Ertel&#039;s &quot;Potential Vorticity&quot; PV Theorem, mentioned in that paper, characterises these symmetries as a conservation.  PV being carried with the flow (materially conserved) then so is any local function of PV alone in particular the local energy, inertia and angular momenta. ( &quot;The conservation of potential enstrophy-the second moment of potential vorticity-is thought to be especially important because it prevents the spurious cascade of energy into high wavenumbers.&quot; - http://coaps.fsu.edu/pub/eric_back/OCP5930/Papers/GeneralMethodsForConservation.non5_5_R01.pdf )]]></description>

You don&#039;t need Noether&#039;s theorem to see that divergence-free vector fields lead to conservation of volume.

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/05/12/fluid-flows-and-infinite-dimensional-manifolds-part-2/#comment-24510&quot;&gt;Tim van Beek&lt;/a&gt;.

Okay.  But it&#039;s really tempting to figure out the conserved quantities associated to the symmetries in the problem we&#039;re talking about---the incompressible frictionless fluid.  Let&#039;s try!

For starters, let&#039;s remember (since it&#039;s been half a year!) that this problem is all about geodesic motion on a certain infinite-dimensional Lie group with a right-invariant metric.   So, the symmetry group is precisely that Lie group.  It acts on itself by right translations.

Next, I&#039;ll remember from my own education that this is a fancy version of a much simpler problem: a rotating object, like a tennis racket, floating at rest in intergalactic space.  There the symmetry group is the rotation group $latex SO(3).$ And there the conserved quantities are the 3 components of angular momentum: $latex J_x, J_y$ and $latex J_z.$  3-dimensional Lie group, 3 conserved quantities.  

So, we need to generalize this, and if we were smart enough we could &lt;i&gt;guess&lt;/i&gt; the correct answer without doing  no calculations with pencil and paper.  

We could &lt;i&gt;guess&lt;/i&gt; that angular momentum is related to rotation symmetry simply because they both have to do with rotating things... and the numbers match: 3-dimensional Lie group, 3 conserved quantities.  

It&#039;s a bit harder to do this guessing for our problem here, because our Lie group is infinite-dimensional.  But we know right away we&#039;re looking for infinitely many conserved quantities.

My first guess is this.  Take the volume of a little parcel of fluid.  Since the fluid is incompressible, this doesn&#039;t change with time.  So, we get a conservation law!  And we get infinitely many of these conservation laws, since there are infinitely many little parcels to look at.

We need to polish this up a bit to get a rigorous formulation of these conservation laws as

$latex \displaystyle{ \frac{d}{d t} \;\mathrm{something} = 0} $

But I think Tim already did this in his blog article!  He wrote this condition for the incompressibility of a little parcel of fluid:

$latex \displaystyle{ \frac{d}{d t} \int_{W_t} d \mu = \frac{d}{d t} \int_{W_0} J^t d \mu = 0} $

So my guess is that these conservation laws, and linear combinations of these, are what we want.  To test this guess, we could think a bit harder and try to see a correspondence between such linear combinations and &lt;i&gt;infinitesimal symmetries&lt;/i&gt;---which for this problem are divergence-free vector fields.  

Actually, I think Tim gave us a clue here, too, since he wrote the equation

$latex \displaystyle{ \left. \partial_t J\right&#124;_{t=0} = \mathrm{div}(u) J }$]]></description>

Actually I am not aware of any results in this direction. 

In case I pick up this topic again, I would also rather go deeper into the calculation/estimation of the curvature and what that implies for the stability of geodesics, instead of talking about how one can formulate the system in the terms of Hamiltonian dynamics etc.]]></description>
