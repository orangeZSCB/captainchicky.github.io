Right.  Many things fall under &quot;fair use&quot;.  One is parody, for example, but you can&#039;t just copy anything, modify it slightly, and claim it is a parody.  :-)]]></description>

I know you probably were just not stating this, but: copyright law allows some copying in certain circumstances (eg, copying a fragment in order to review, critique or satirise it).

Adding your marginalia would only change things if you really need to see the original to understand original content in your marginalia (so &quot;this is so right!&quot; probably doesn&#039;t count), and even then quoting a whole paper with comments would probably fail the reasonableness test.

Of course the other issue is that this just gives you a defence against a legal charge: just dealing with one is timewise and moneywise often a problem in itself.]]></description>

2) ... it would be that much harder to see if the tree was falling on him.

1) Yes. Only, it could never come to trial.

0) An unjust law is no law.]]></description>

Yes, band theory is probably the way to go, but I think the gravitational force must come in because that is what seems to make the difference between non-metal and metal. What bothers me is that each H has only one electron so holes left will be protons.]]></description>

I imagine the calculation they&#039;re really trying to do is something like this: consider a lattice of protons, then simulate many electrons moving in this lattice, see what the allowed energy levels are, and see if the &#039;valence band&#039; touches the &#039;conduction band&#039;.  If so, it&#039;ll conduct electricity.  Of course the answer should depend on the separation between atoms.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_band&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Isolator-metal.svg/450px-Isolator-metal.svg.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Also, unless you know what shape the lattice is, I think you need to consider different possible shapes, find the average energy per electron in the lowest-energy state, and find the lattice that minimizes that.  

There are experts on this, but I&#039;m not one, so I could be getting it wrong.  There&#039;s a discussion for lithium &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_band&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.   Hydrogen will be different since it has just one electron.   

I don&#039;t think the gravitational force matters much here!]]></description>

Duh, if you don&#039;t have the copyright you don&#039;t have the right to copy it.  Remember the &quot;in any form by any means&quot; stuff.  Regardless of what one thinks of copyright, free access to scientific papers, it&#039;s pretty basic to understand that if someone else has the copyright then no-one else has the right to copy it, at least without special permission.]]></description>
