&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/2014/04/19/304896452/avalanche-sweeps-12-sherpas-off-mt-everest&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Avalanche sweeps 12 Sherpas off Mt. Everest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Weekend Edition&lt;/i&gt;, National Public Radio,19 April 2014.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The climbers were on the south side, which is the route that originates in Nepal and goes up the Khumbu Glacier to the South Pole then on to the summit. They key point on this is climbing up through the Khumbu Icefall, and this is a stretch of glaciers that tumbles over a drop. And it&#039;s sort of like a river rapids, if you can imagine, but ice. And so there&#039;s blocks, and there&#039;s a lot of objective hazards. And it&#039;s the most dangerous part on the route as you go towards the summit.

And in this case, we had Sherpas that were carrying loads through the icefall. And one of the hanging glaciers to the east of the climbing route, hanging off the west shoulder of Everest released, and then that avalanche of ice blocks is what took the lives of the Sherpas.

It is harder to get a permit from the Chinese.  The mountain is made of limestone, and the strata are slanted so that they rise from south to north.   This means that the cliffs on the north side are more daunting.

Reinhold Messner climbed the north side solo during the monsoon, which still seems impossible to me.  He bypassed the cliffs by climbing a couloir.]]></description>
