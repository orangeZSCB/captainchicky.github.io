					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/04/07/the-living-smart-grid/#comment-14905&quot;&gt;John Baez&lt;/a&gt;.

To clarify, Bill, I&#039;ll offer the two cases for comparison.  My apologies for not making it clearer.

If we do nothing and allow the currently planned system to move forward, this is what is expected to result.

The utility companies will increase their rates to cover massive transmission line upgrades.  They will sell regulators on the need for their &#039;smart grid&#039; meters and further raise rates to cover that cost.  The current spare capacity requirements will remain in place and be applied to much higher grid usage which will result in even more wasted spare capacity.  To combat this while still not being required to change it, they will argue for more control via their smart meters.  This has already begun in the form of agreements with end-user customers that allow high demand periods to give shut-down control of targeted appliances to the utility companies.

The sum benefits for the customer is increased rates, decreased convenience and a false promise of easier/cheaper integration of renewables.

If, instead, we move toward the proposed plan, the following benefits could easily result.

Immediate usage knowledge will be available to the people, creating a new awareness of the situation.  Rules allowing fair participation via load shedding, onsite generation and storage buffering will need to be addressed as a result.  This is a discussion that&#039;s been needed for more than a decade.  On that step&#039;s completion, the market will offer tools ranging from benign to powerful as demand requests them.  Those tools, consisting of spreadsheets, power displays, controller boxes and eventually to integrated features on new appliances, create the opportunity to switch to the new billing system and save money for the customer.  

As they migrate over, the grid&#039;s hourly swing smooths out, lowing the necessary spare capacity requirement of related transmission lines.  As this becomes officially recognized, the mandated requirements can be proportionally relaxed.  If this happens before the current requirements mandate new lines, those new lines can be avoided.  The utility company will have less capital to manage and charge overhead on.  In addition to reduced transmission lines, they will have less generation spare capacity needs (types like &#039;spinning reserve&#039; - which is pre-warmed up generators just waiting to be connected).  This will save them money and burn less fuel, but not help their bottom line.  By crying wolf on this last issue, they have massaged the system so that even the cheap power gets paid on margins, so it&#039;s in their interest to keep this a problem issue.  The last thing they want is direct competition by home generation on their scale.  This is why we will never hear them admit that renewables have any serious capacity.]]></description>

This is touted as providing better control, prediction and utilization of our nation’s electrical grid system. However, it doesn’t provide anyone except the utilities more benefits. It’s expected to cost much more and to actually take away some of the convenience of having all the power you want, when you want it.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cost more to whom? It&#039;s certainly possible that utilities could use their political clout to game the system (though I think here in California they&#039;ll get no more than minor advantages). But in the mid and long term, building less and encouraging distributed production -- which is already beginning in California -- will produce substantial savings and avoided costs.

The biggest benefit as I see it, though, is as part of a process of making everything about power more transparent, with fewer &#039;externalized&#039; costs -- real costs which those who use and those who profit avoid far, far too much in our current economy. Want convenience -- a 70 degree house on a 110 degree day? Pay for it. Want to dump carbon, or particulates or a hundred other pollutants into the air we all breathe? Have it publicly accounted, and pay for it.﻿

Hi!  Are you saying that all the automated systems will tend to turn on and off at the same time?  Isn&#039;t it possible to deliberately avoid that, e.g. by putting a little randomness into the programs?

Do you know any aspects of smart grid implementations that need help from people who are good at math or physics?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for a well-written post that takes a skeptical look at the hyped smart grid area. 

I&#039;ve written my thesis about smart grid implementation in Sweden. The grid here is for example more stable and have more capacity, which creates less incentives for a SG, compared to the USA. But we&#039;re in the SG-hype in some sense since, for example, we&#039;re in the process of implementing hour-based prices around 2014-15 for small customers, with the help from smart metering. An issue I&#039;ve come across is the fact that much automation of heating for example, to shift it to a time with a low-price, would create an issue with &quot;returning load&quot;. For example all the radiators run during the night, but that will only result in a small difference in price between night and day. And when all the automated load turns on and off at the same time even the Swedish grid will run into problems capacity-wise at those times. 

Cheers,
Johan]]></description>

I don&#039;t know any of the rules applicable to Europe but I can say one thing.  Their concerns are that there is enough spare capacity available after considering the financial gaming that results from hedging activities.

Related to that, this system would be resilient to such problems for two reasons.  There are no financial levels riding over top of the price to be gamed.  The only way to manipulate the price is to actually buy or sell power or to change your demand and those activities are no different from actual users so you would always pay (or gain) exactly what you&#039;re using.

The other reason is that this layout acts to smooth or completely flatten the hourly swing in grid load.  How much this happens depends on the aggregate capabilities of everyone involved but as that user base increases, the daily profile will settle to a flat line.  Even major changes, such as a large generator or transmission line failure, would have less and less impact.  

Given these two factors, planning for both emergencies and future expansion becomes easier to predict.  Gone would be the days when a spare 20-40% capacity just sits there waiting for a once-in-a-decade event.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[May be it is interesting for you to compare with problems in similar approaches not on the direct customer (as your approach suggests)  but on a higher level within Europe:

There are two separate problems to control being discussed here.  

The first is the control of the grid&#039;s balance (supply = demand).  That one is controlled by a single factor - price.  The current method has no control over demand and forces supply to always match a wildly variable demand.  Any level of feedback can only improve that scenario, not worsen it and certainly, a wide range of such feedbacks will stabilize it tremendously.  The only factor not accounted for is the speed and resolution of this loop.  Given that both are interdependent on each other with faster being better, there&#039;s only the speed of the customers&#039; appliances hindering this process.

The second form of control is that appliance (or DG/storage system) responding to the published price.  At this level, better response results in more savings to the customer, but also better prediction algorithms do too.  

It&#039;s this prediction capacity which could cause overshoot or over-dampening.  In magnitude, however, this will be very small compared to the radical swings of today.  Even so, with this also reflected in price, there&#039;s yet another factor for the appliances to evaluate in their analysis.  The competition model suggests that if there was money to be gained from incorporating this small extra code, it would become ubiquitous.

About 5 years ago, I built a spreadsheet that simulates all players in this game.  It had blocks for loads, generators and storage as well as transmission and large scale generation (no local distribution costs).  The hardest part was setting up randomized patterns of user load profiles.  What I found was that as the number of customers increased, the effect of any major change became increasingly insignificant and the price and grid load stayed quite smooth.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/04/07/the-living-smart-grid/#comment-14808&quot;&gt;dave tweed&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks Dave,  As before, your last line identifies the solution to the problem you mention.  In a world of open algorithms, the response time and feedback quantity will vary tremendously on the part of the customers.  This provides the needed dampening effect to smooth things out in both directions.  Add to this the potential for higher resolution feedback so predictions can be better tuned.

In my former automation life, I used to tie feedbacks to very slow processes like a water treatment tank filling up and the chemical makeup reaching some limit.  This is done with a PID loop using Proportional, Integral and Derivative feedbacks which all happen incredibly fast.  The normal result was huge overshoots as you describe, but after tweaking those individual factors, I found that you can tune just about any loop for both speed and magnitude.  I have to assume that since this would maximize customer profit (when also considering startup/shutdown costs), this is where the algorithms will migrate toward.  After all, what manufacturer would make their appliance wear out prematurely due to rapid cycling if it&#039;s under warranty?]]></description>

<p>Thanks Dave,  As before, your last line identifies the solution to the problem you mention.  In a world of open algorithms, the response time and feedback quantity will vary tremendously on the part of the customers.  This provides the needed dampening effect to smooth things out in both directions.  Add to this the potential for higher resolution feedback so predictions can be better tuned.</p>

At the heart of this is a systems control problem. As you&#039;ve mentioned in the last line Todd, it&#039;s easily possible to install an automatic algorithm on a device these days. What I don&#039;t know is whether the state of the art in control algorithms is robustly keep things stable, particularly if there are other unknown-to-it algorithms out there.

An over-simplified example would be an oversubscribed coal-fired power station: it starts to make power expensive, then huge numbers of clients turn themselves off, but there&#039;s a start-up/shutdown time to the coal-fired power station so it&#039;s going to take, say, 30 min to shut itself off. So it makes the cost attractively low to get people to make use of the generated power during the shutdown phase. Suddenly lots of agents think it&#039;s time to start using power again. In an ideal scenario new users &quot;sense&quot; to stop just when it&#039;s at standard operating capacity; it&#039;s easy to imagine enough of a lag/misunderstood price signal so that it gets oversubscribed and the cycle begins again.

This is oversimplified, but my vague sense of the discipline is that stability is still tricky in an &quot;open world&quot; where there are competing algorithms.]]></description>
