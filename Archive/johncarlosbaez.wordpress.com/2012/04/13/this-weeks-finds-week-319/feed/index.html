					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve re-implemented parts of the climate model as an editable in-browser app. All of the code, some of it borrowed from Allan&#039;s &quot;spiffier version&quot;, is in a set of editors on the page. This is part of my experimenting with an informal workbook-blog style, that combines notes, code, and images. Also, I&#039;m learning about climate science. If you want to run the app, follow the instructions in the Notes editor at the top of the page. If you want to modify something, just click inside one of the editors, start typing, and then click Run or Refresh to re-run the app.

Thanks for making me aware of JSXGraph and MathJax.

Regards,
Ken]]></description>

  When I first read about the simple climate model, I thought, that the idea would be to help &quot;average people&quot; to understand the system.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I replied:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I am reluctant to explain climate science to &quot;average people&quot; before I actually know climate science.  So far I think the Azimuth Project goal is to

1) learn climate science

and

2) teach it while we learn it

so that

3) we can make sure we understand it

and

4) we can get students of science, and working scientists, more interested in the subject.

In short, the current goal is to slowly build a kind of online course on climate science.   So: not just one model, but many models, slowly increasing in complexity.   Also: for such an online course, we need to explain the actual equations being used, and the many simplifying assumptions used in obtaining these equations.

However, once we have the software working, we can change it slightly, and change the text that accompanies it, to make it suitable for different audiences.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I should add that most of my blog output consists of &#039;teaching things while learning them&#039;, and this means &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; acting authoritative and explaining everything in the simplest possible way to the largest possible audience, but instead putting in enough detail so that people can learn along with me, and asking questions when I don&#039;t understand things.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
And I’m thrilled with the javascript library you spotted and pretty much have to learn it, but that is better (and more likely) than inventing it from scratch…
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here &#039;you&#039;, of course, is not me.  I&#039;m glad you joined the Azimuth Forum, so you can talk to the computer experts on the team.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Climate is a system with phenomenology spanning many orders of magnitude in space and in time. If you&#039;re going to build &quot;a climate model&quot; to explain why the current ice age started 5 Ma ago you will be doing something very different (geochemistry) from building a model of the vertical temperature structure of the atmosphere with convection (thermodynamic equilibrium). Neither of these class of model is what the public is referring to when they discuss &quot;climate models&quot;, which are essentially weather models run for a very long time, where the dominant phenomenology is &quot;GFD&quot; (geophysical fluid dynamics, or dynamics of rotating, stratified fluids) which if you ask me is the fun part. 

It&#039;s very interesting watching you recapitulate Budyko. So far you haven&#039;t done anything wrong. But it&#039;s a long way to Ooyama...

I think there is a question of purpose here. I have my own ideas of what the purpose of an effort at climate modeling from a blank slate would be. I don&#039;t know that it will match. Still, I am sure whatever you come up with will be worthwhile and I&#039;m happy to participate if I might.
