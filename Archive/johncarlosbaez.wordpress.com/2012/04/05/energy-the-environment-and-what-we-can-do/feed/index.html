Simplicio - I&#039;m curious, how did you do it? What do you think is the best solution for giving a talk via Skype, and seeing and controlling your own slides remotely? One requirement is that the remote audience should see the high-res versions of the slides (i.e. downloaded before the time and running on a local computer in the audience) since a blurry Skype streaming image won&#039;t do for those complicated climate change graphs!]]></description>

I like keeping my feet firmly on the ground and not raising false hopes---it actually makes me more, not less productive.  But I agree, not everyone responds well to this.  I&#039;ll think about it more.  Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi! I saw this randomly on youtube and I have to say that it was very interesting. The conclusions, based in hard numbers, you present are hardly (and sadly) incontestable and you look into some simple, doable things as well as in creative stuff. And I loved that you sent your robot instead. I actually wasn&#039;t aware that flying made such a tremendous impact, even relatively. But I have to constructively   point what I think is a mistake: You shouldn&#039;t end the presentation with such a disheartening line! &#039;Will this stop global warming? No.&#039;

I&#039;m not saying that you should lie or mislead in any way, but you can  reformulate the question and make emphasis instead in another point, which is both true and positive. Like maybe adding something like &#039;Will it help/Is it necessary? Hell yes&#039;. Or maybe even scrap the first question entirely. You see, people like thinking that what they do really matters and visibly makes things better. A more positive presentation will get more people involved!

That being said, I&#039;ll be following the Azimuth Project closely, I love the idea. Best of lucks with it!]]></description>

That&#039;s true.  But to some extent this is the result of government and business policies that are &lt;i&gt;based&lt;/i&gt; on the &#039;growth is good philosophy&#039;.  In other words, things are set up so they work smoothly only when there&#039;s a constant exponential growth of GDP.   This is the model we know and love.  It&#039;s very hard for businesses and governments to even &lt;i&gt;conceive&lt;/i&gt; of another model.  

I&#039;m trying to encourage people to start thinking about other models.  And a first step is for people to stop &lt;i&gt;defining&lt;/i&gt; growth to be good and start thinking about what&#039;s really good---like you&#039;re doing here!  I like your ideas. 

I&#039;m not advocating some instant drastic change in society.  

Luckily, I am also &lt;i&gt;able&lt;/i&gt; to get people to start thinking about other models, and &lt;i&gt;unable&lt;/i&gt; to cause an instant dramatic change in society.  &lt;img src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/emoticons/tongue2.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi John, very nice talk !

&lt;blockquote&gt;The economic objections are largely based on a ‘growth is good’ philosophy ... &lt;/blockquote&gt;

I think it&#039;s a little more than &quot;a philosophy&quot;, in the sense that lack of growth (in the GDP sense) causes widespread unemployment, which means real suffering for a lot of people, and troubles for businesses (both facts explain why governments are reluctant to take measures that might hinder growth).

In a sense we are probably postponing the suffering and possibly pushing it towards the poorest, closer to the equator, and closer to the sea, countries (not to mention species on the extinction path).

I guess the best way to minimize suffering would be to still pursue growth while switching to cleaner energy. That is, governments could tax carbon and use such taxes (but many more money would need to be &quot;printed&quot;) to massively build wind turbines and maybe thorium reactors, and redo the electrical grid, therefore also giving job to a lot of people.

After that, at some point we would probably need to transition towards a zero-growth economy, but i think this needs to happen later, otherwise everything could be harder.

In other words if somehow growth (in the GDP sense) would stop tomorrow, the CO2 emission rate will somehow decrease, but at the price of widespread suffering, and besides that, I fear that it would make it harder, not easier, the transition to cleaner energy sources.]]></description>

I didn&#039;t get too many questions.  Most people who came to the talk seemed to believe that human-caused global warming is a real problem, so there wasn&#039;t any sort of &#039;skeptical&#039; debate as one might get sometimes.  And since it was a talk during people&#039;s work hours, they didn&#039;t hang around too long.  I think of it as just the start of a long travelling road show.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had expected more questions, because probably most people have already heard about global warming and a lot of people seem to have a settled opinion about it :-)

Or did they wait to ask their questions to you personally after the talk?]]></description>

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Of course&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; it was a gimmick!  The only reason for using it was to attract attention to the talk and attract attention to the idea that robots can be used to reduce air travel.  The Anybot is not designed for giving lectures and not particularly good for that purpose... though another sort of robot could be.  It&#039;s designed for things like getting an American business person to tour a manufacturing plant in China without actually going there.]]></description>
