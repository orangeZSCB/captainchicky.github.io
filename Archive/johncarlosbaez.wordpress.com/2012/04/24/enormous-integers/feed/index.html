&quot;Luminous&quot; and &quot;Dark Integers&quot; are two short stories by Greg Egan about a different mathematical universe and its interaction with ours.  The best way to read them now seems to be this book:

					<description><![CDATA[I remember in the 1970&#039;s playing with lambda-expressions for Church numerals, and experimenting with
(1) how large a Church numeral one could get with a lambda-expression of limited size
(2) how small an expression was sufficient t express particular integers.
And I was interested in integers that were the simpler than the others in their neighbourhood.
It didn&#039;t take long before I realized that passing an integer as a parameter to another gave me exponentiation, which was thus a lot simpler than using addition of multiplication.
Nor did it take long to realize that actually comparing the large integers represented by these lambda expressions quickly became infeasible.
I assigned a cost of 1 for each application and each lambda.
I did tinker with a computer program that would generate &lt;em&gt;typed&lt;/em&gt; lambda expressions of the proper type (T-&#062;T)-&#062;(T-&#062;T), but it didn&#039;t produce anything interesting in practical time.
At some point I figured that I&#039;d really have to impose some information-theoretic cost to the use of variables, perhaps a logarithm depending on how many contextually bound variables were available to choose from... this got inconveniently complicated and the project was laid to rest.]]></description>

This URL appears to have had &quot;...&quot; inserted into it.  Anyway, it doesn&#039;t work (although it perhaps used to).  I may remember reading the story -- is it the one where our computational world was being invaded by a different set of integers; the invasion becoming evident starting with the &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; integers used in cryptography?]]></description>

Your link to Hilbert Levitz&#039;s paper, Transfinite ordinals and their notations: for the uninitiated, is broken.  If I chop off several parts at the start of the URL it works.  So I suspect the software generating this web page is prefixing something to the URL that it shouldn&#039;t.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/04/24/enormous-integers/#comment-19121&quot;&gt;Jeff&lt;/a&gt;.

J. E. Littlewood acknowledged the difficulty in the chapter Large Numbers of his book &quot;Littlewood&#039;s Miscellany.&quot;  Here&#039;s his comment (plus a bit of the rest of the chapter, to give you a taste)-

&quot;We can now say: scrap the existing definitions, as scaffolding, and define &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; to be $latex f_1(n)$, and carry on as before. We can scrap again, and so on: here I decide to stop. Once we stop we may take $latex f_0(n) = n^2$, or $latex n + 1$ (what we take does not matter provided only $latex f_0(n) &#062; n$).

The reader will agree that the numbers mentioned are large: it is not possible to say how large; all that can be said about them is that they are defined as they are defined. If it were desired to compare terms in two rival systems a considerable technique would have to be developed.&quot;]]></description>
