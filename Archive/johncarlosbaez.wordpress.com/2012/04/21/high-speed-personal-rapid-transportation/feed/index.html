I was the one who translated Todd&#039;s numbers into metric, so I&#039;m to blame for not knowing the standard abbreviation of kilometers per hour used in the automobile world.  (Of course I know it in the physics world.) I&#039;ll fix that---thanks!]]></description>

Very cool.  I didn&#039;t know that.

It makes me wonder if it might not be better to have stations build up a stored vacuum to various levels and then &#039;shoot&#039; the cars down the track by quickly dumping a calculated amount of &#039;vacuum&#039; in front of it.  This would leave a cushion of air in front of the car which could be vented as it approached the end, and then trapped when it should be slowed to a stop.

But then I remember that we&#039;re in the 21st Century and I&#039;d rather look forward to a system more like what the Tesla car company would build than what Beach did long ago.]]></description>

While all the existing ones are shining examples that worked out very nicely in the end, they are also examples of how not to save money and resources.

The Morgantown one has very complex and heavy vehicles.  Each of the 4 corners has rubber tires, wheel bearings, brakes, suspension, steering and power driven to it from a transmission from the electrical motor.  I&#039;ve heard you can fit almost a hundred people in them so all of this has to be pretty beefy and because of that, the track has almost as much concrete structure as a regular highway.  No wonder those systems are all expected to cost $40 million per mile today.

This does show that even with all that extra hardware, it makes very economical sense.  With entry level prices starting at 1/4th of that and then dropping, the Skytran should really take off.]]></description>

I have no affiliation with either one beyond a couple phone calls for information a few years ago.  I do try to keep up on their progress though.

The Skytran, in my opinion, is the most viable to get started quickly.  I can easily see a university campus installing an entry level system which quickly expands to include some external major attractions, then bus routes and eventually schools and neighborhoods.  Unfortunately, those entrenched industries you refer to have already gotten the first shot off.  I was informed 4 years ago that after this was reviewed in Michigan (or Minnesota?), the rail companies successfully lobbied to get the term &quot;rail&quot; legally defined as &quot;steel wheels on steel rails&quot;.  I also know that at one time, Masdar and Holland have considered pilot projects.  With the economics, I personally think it could be started quicker in some small town that simply puts up their own factory and starts growing it outward. 

I also know of some up-and-coming energy game changers who are grooming their future business models to team up and do this privately.

The ET3 seems to be following a different funding model.  They are selling licenses in trade for technology and solutions to various problems (both technical and political).  They project that the interest which China has will be enough added to those partners in another year or two, to get it done.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/04/21/high-speed-personal-rapid-transportation/#comment-15048&quot;&gt;Arrow&lt;/a&gt;.

You&#039;re exactly correct that it depends on the quality of the vacuum.  As I mentioned to your other comment above, it becomes a simple matter of economics based on how often you want to boost the speed back up to the maximum.  The trade-off is wind drag vs. evacuation level.  I have no basis for judging this (haven&#039;t done the math yet), but it would seem logical that $1 spent on reducing drag periodically goes further than spending it on propulsion energy for every trip.

Given that this issue even exists, this means that at speed, there&#039;s plenty of air for contacting a radiator to dissipate heat.  Plus, there&#039;s always the option of thermal mass that can be &#039;recharged&#039; between trips.]]></description>

&quot;Pulling a vacuum is a much easier and less energy intensive problem than pumping air in a tube across the country.&quot;

It all depends what you mean by vacuum. For example reaching outer-space quality vacuum is next to impossible on Earth, even going below 100 nanopascals is a great feat which requires specialized materials and baking of the entire system in high temp before operation.

So the question is what kind of vacuum is needed for a car to achieve 4000mph without overheating? The webpage linked above has no technical information at all, perhaps one of you is able to do a rough calculation? 

Also while the vacuum certainly lowers drag it also makes cooling much more problematic due to thermal insulation.]]></description>
