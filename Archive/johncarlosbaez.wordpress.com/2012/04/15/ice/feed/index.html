					<description><![CDATA[This pingback leads to a site that stole my blog post but turned it into gobbledygook.  For example:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  There’s a conjecture attributable to a man named Robin J. Presently, which implies the liquid-vapor spinodal intersects the curve of density maxima! And it does so at destructive pressures. I don’t truly understand the importance of this, however it certainly sounds chilly. Gargantuan-chilly.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Any reason why someone would bother doing this?   I can see why someone might want to change words to avoid some crude plagiarism-detection algorithms, but what&#039;s the point if you create a bunch of ridiculous bullshit?]]></description>

Thanks but, as far as I had noticed I had fixed that already in the second comment, but there was still a problem, the problem might have been that I had placed smaller and bigger signs as brackets for indicating an average.]]></description>

You started your equation with

&#036;\latex

instead of

&#036;latex

A common mistake.  I&#039;ll fix it.]]></description>

What one could also think of is that the particles may exchange positions without volume change but that the average acceleration per surface of the particles slows down/gets smaller with increasing entropy, i.e. there could eventually be a need for a term with a pressure differential $latex dp $. This goes eventually somewhat into the direction of what &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/02/01/entropic-forces/#comment-39896&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;amarashiki&lt;/a&gt; was sort of thinking of, if one thinks of p as some average $latex  /A $ ??]]></description>

Did they do time series also at constant temperature ?
If one assumes that no heat energy would be transferred to a block of ice (I don&#039;t know wether this could be seen as applying to the experiment, i.e. if this is an &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiabatic_process&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;adiabatic process&lt;/a&gt;) and moreover if the block could be seen as isolated (pressure, volume) (again I don&#039;t know to which extend this would apply here) then within a certain time there &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;should&lt;/a&gt; on average be more disorder and this may refer not only to the hydrogen atoms but also to the oxygen atoms, moreover the disorder change should go together with different pressure, temperature and volume change of the block, i.e. dS = 1/T p dV

&lt;blockquote&gt;There’s also an uncountable infinity of other patterns that all give you equally dense packings. For example:
-a-b-a-c-b-a-c-b-c-b-a-c- &lt;/blockquote&gt;

But then since the volume stays the same, where would the work come from?  By sucking heat from the oil bath?]]></description>
