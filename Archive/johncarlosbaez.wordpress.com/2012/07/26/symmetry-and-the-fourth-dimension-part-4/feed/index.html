					<description><![CDATA[Greg Egan solved today&#039;s puzzle &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/07/26/symmetry-and-the-fourth-dimension-part-4/#comment-17186&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but there&#039;s another slightly different solution nobody has mentioned yet.  This involves an &lt;i&gt;equation&lt;/i&gt; instead of an inequality.  

Suppose are trying to classify all the Platonic solids. We&#039;re looking for ways to tile the surface of a sphere with regular $latex m$-gons, with $latex n$ meeting at each vertex. Suppose there are a total of $latex V$ vertices, $latex E$ edges, and $latex F$ faces. Since the Euler characteristic of the sphere is 2, we have

$latex V - E + F = 2$

Since each face has $latex m$ edges but 2 faces meet along each edge, we have

$latex mF = 2E$

Since each vertex has $latex m$ edges meeting it but each edge meets 2 vertices, we also have

$latex nV = 2E$

Putting these equations together we get

$latex \displaystyle{ 2E\left( \frac{1}{m} + \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{2} \right) = 2 }$

or

$latex \displaystyle{  \frac{1}{m} + \frac{1}{n} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{E} } $

Of course this implies the inequality we&#039;ve already seen:

$latex \displaystyle{  \frac{1}{m} + \frac{1}{n} &#062; \frac{1}{2} } $

&lt;i&gt;A priori&lt;/i&gt; the equation is stronger than the inequality, but it just happens to be equivalent, at least when 

$latex m, n \ge 2$

Whenever a sum of two reciprocals of two numbers like this exceeds 1/2, it exceeds 1/2 by a reciprocal of a number like this! And this number is the number of &lt;i&gt;edges&lt;/i&gt; of your Platonic solid...

... or hosohedron, or dihedron.

For example

$latex \displaystyle{  \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{3} &#062; \frac{1}{2} } $

gives the cube, but in fact

$latex \displaystyle{  \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{7}{12} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{12} }  $

so the cube has 12 edges!  Simple but pretty stuff.]]></description>

Yes, the modularity theorem is weirdly self-referential.   I&#039;ve always been puzzled why everyone explaining this stuff doesn&#039;t mention that.

It&#039;s even more amusing that this self-referential result is what it took to prove something seemingly &#039;concrete&#039; like Fermat&#039;s Last Theorem.

$latex a^n + b^n = c^n$

would give an elliptic curve

$latex y^2 = x(x - a^n)(x + b^n)$

 that couldn&#039;t be covered by a modular one.   This was later proved by Jean-Pierre Serre and Kenneth Ribet.  And that made it clear what had do be done to prove Fermat&#039;s Last Theorem: prove the modularity theorem, or at least enough of it to cover this case.]]></description>

John explained:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Modular curves can be seen as parametrizing families of elliptic curves. [..] Sometimes an elliptic curve can be covered by a modular curve using a so-called ‘branched cover’. There’s a big theorem called the modularity theorem which says (very roughly) that all elliptic curves defined by equations using just rational numbers can be covered in this way by modular curves.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Oh, I was talking about the essence of ADE theory, not all its ramifications and applications...   

I guess you&#039;ve seen John McKay&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ADE.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;terse blast of information&lt;/a&gt; on this subject.  It mainly serves to make you want to learn more.]]></description>

Well, I sort of changed course midstream, switching from my intended goal to something I find easier to understand.  If I&#039;d kept marching boldly ahead, I would have said something like this (but longer, and maybe more helpful, though maybe less):

Since Klein&#039;s quartic curve is a curled-up piece of the hyperbolic plane, it&#039;s called a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_curve&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&#039;modular curve&#039;&lt;/a&gt;.  Modular curves can be seen as parametrizing families of elliptic curves (roughly speaking, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_curve&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;tori&lt;/a&gt;) equipped with extra structure.  

This is a nice big story already.  However, it then takes a weird turn and gets much more intense.

There&#039;s another weirder relation between modular curves and elliptic curves.  Sometimes an elliptic curve can be &lt;i&gt;covered&lt;/i&gt; by a modular curve using a so-called &#039;branched cover&#039;.   There&#039;s a big theorem called the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modularity_theorem&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;modularity theorem&lt;/a&gt; which says (very roughly) that all elliptic curves defined by equations using just rational numbers can be covered in this way by modular curves. 

And this theorem implies Fermat&#039;s Last Theorem!

So, as usual in number theory, the flashy easy-to-explain result follows as a corollary from something that&#039;s harder to explain, but ultimately more interesting and more connected to &lt;i&gt;geometry&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;symmetry&lt;/i&gt;. 

The proof of the modularity theorem is not easy: Andrew Wiles and a grad student of his proved enough of it to get Fermat&#039;s Last Theorem, and other good mathematicians finished off the job.   

Instead of reading about that, it&#039;s a lot less stressful to start with:

&#8226; Tim Silverman, &lt;a href=&quot;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2010/10/test.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pictures of Modular Curves (Part I)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-Category Caf&#038;eeacute;, 10 October 2006.

and read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=silverman+pictures+of+modular+curves&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;all 11 parts&lt;/a&gt;.   You&#039;ll get a deeper understanding of creatures like

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt; V---8---F---3---E&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

as shown here:

Later in this series we&#039;ll certainly be using Coxeter diagrams to help classify Platonic solids in 4 dimensions.   They&#039;re also good for classifying &#039;tilings&#039; of 3d Euclidean space and 3d hyperbolic space by polyhedra.  In case that mixture of 4&#039;s and 3&#039;s annoys you: these examples are actually all living in the same dimension, since a 4d Platonic solid is a special tiling of a 3-sphere by polyhedra.  Spherical, planar and hyperbolic geometry always go hand in hand in mathematics.

But, understanding which Coxeter diagrams give which things isn&#039;t simply a matter of taking sums of reciprocals.  We&#039;ll see, I guess!]]></description>

Your example doesn&#039;t look very scary to me. That&#039;s nice. Next time i&#039;m lost in the jargon i&#039;ll try and imagine klein&#039;s quartic rolling over the hyperbolic plane. I can now see how spheres are limited and why a cylinder is a bit too plain for this kind of fun. Thanks for the insight, oh and for the link to the Congruence Groups.]]></description>
