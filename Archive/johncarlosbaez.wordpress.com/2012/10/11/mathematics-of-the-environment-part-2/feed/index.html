Hi John,

I&#039;ll also be at AGU. 

If you happen to be walking by NG010: Nonlinear and Scaling Processes in the Atmosphere and Ocean at all Scales, From Microscales to Climate, from 800-1200am on Thursday, consider stopping by my poster on vortex generation by breaking surface gravity waves.

Are you presenting? If so, during what session?

Definitely get a hotel soon.  Many of the nearby hotels are already full (or at least the reasonably priced ones).  AGU is the largest annual scientific conference in the world.  (One of the nearby restaurant/pubs doesn&#039;t let its staff take vacations during AGU because it&#039;s their busiest week ... all those geologists.)]]></description>

Cool - I look forward to chatting. I dabbled a little in category theory a few years back - we published some papers where we used it for composing software specifications and reasoning about the semantics of composition, especially where specs were mutually inconsistent. But I can&#039;t claim to have any deeper understanding than just some basic categorical constructs, and a vague sense of how it provides an elegant tool for reasoning about structure.

For the AGU meeting, local info is here:

Monoidal categories are the mathematician&#039;s language for talking about things that can be hooked up either in series (composition) or parallel (tensoring).  My ultimate goal is to use them to better understand &#039;networks&#039; of many kinds.  Of course category theory needs to be combined with other kinds of math to accomplish anything really interesting in this direction.   And, I need to find problems that people would be happy to have solved (even if they didn&#039;t know it ahead of time), which my techniques might solve.  Examples might include: how is the stability of a complex system made of complex parts related to the stability of the parts?

So far I&#039;ve mainly been thinking about a few kinds of networks: Feynman diagrams in particle physics, stochastic Petri nets, Markov processes, electrical circuits and  Bayesian networks (aka belief networks).  These turn out to be mathematically a lot more tightly related than you might at first think, and that&#039;s bound to be a good thing.  But it&#039;ll take a while longer before I can prove results that excite people who aren&#039;t interested in conceptual unification for its own sake.  

Box models are definitely also on my to-do list, but so far my friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.1513&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Eugene Lerman&lt;/a&gt; is way ahead of me on those.

See  you!  Should I, umm, be getting a hotel and stuff?  I didn&#039;t get any information about that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[John - I suspect you might be the first ever to mention of climate models and category theory at the same time. Are you thinking that morphisms just provide a conceptual tool for thinking about composition, or do you have plans to wheel out more of the mathematics of categories to construct or prove properties of inter-linked box models?

Let&#039;s talk about this at the AGU meeting.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/10/11/mathematics-of-the-environment-part-2/#comment-20808&quot;&gt;Renato Iturriaga&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi John     
    
 Here are some little codes of the day   ( http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7915230/Luna/dia.rtf  )and the night   (http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7915230/Luna/noche.rtf )dynamics. They run in the demo version of &quot;Berkeley Madonna&quot; software.
 
 
 The first one solves the equation
 
 $latex \frac {dT}{d t} = \frac {1}{H*\rho*d} ( \cos \theta* S_0*sin(\frac{3.14t}{A})- \sigma  T^4) $
 
 Where $H$ is the heat capacity, $latex \rho $  the density, and $d$ is the effective depth. Since apparently the moon  is mostly silicates like sand,  I choose the values for sand: 800 $latex \frac {J}{kg* K}$  and 2000 $latex \frac {kg}{m^3}$. Also I thought 10 cm was a reasonable value for the effective depth.  $\theta $ is the latitude (in radians), $latex S_0$ the full power of the sun (1370)  and $latex A$ is the numbers of seconds in half of the moon  cycle. 
 
 For the equator with an initial temperature of 50 degrees Kelvin we get 
 
 http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7915230/Luna/day%20equator%20Ti%3D50.png
 
and for the same location but starting at 130 degrees
we get

http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7915230/Luna/day%20equator%20Ti%3D%20130.png  
 
 What I find interesting is that it really doesn&#039;t  matter where at what temperature  you start with, by noon you have a value very near the maximum thermodynamical equilibria for the full power of the sun.  To change the final temperature we have to change of latitude , here is a graph at  45 degrees.
 http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7915230/Luna/day%2C%20latitud%2045.png
 
 The night equation is simpler, it  does not depend on the latitude 

    $latex \frac {dT}{d t} = -\frac {1}{H*\rho*d}  \sigma  T^4 $
    
    here is a graph starting  the night at 220
    http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7915230/Luna/noche%20Ti%3D220.png
    
    and here is a graph starting  the night at 150
    http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7915230/Luna/noche%20Ti%3D150.png

    
    Note that in the equation  there is no 4 as I thought before, this is for two practical reasons and I would like to hear a good reason.
    The first reason is that if I put here,  I should put it also  in the day equation. But then the maximum noon temperature would be much less than the observed one,  in fact changing the value of the thermodynamical equilibrium. The other reason is that if a leave it I don&#039;t get reasonable temperatures,  in order to adjust to get reasonable temperatures I  have to adjust the effective depth to something like 40 cm. Which for some reason  I think is to much.  
    
   The following is nice: Let $latex T_f$ the composition of the two dynamics, a map from $[0,390 ]$ to itself. We start from some temperature and after 29.5 days we have another temperature. By elementary calculus -the mean value theorem- there is a fixed point, this fix point corresponds ti a periodic orbit. Moreover the transformation is a huge contraction, as we observed before more or less independently of the initial morning temperature we arrive near the maximum, the cooling is also contraction  so there is only one fixed point, so the periodic orbit is an attractor. 
   
   There is something that still is not very well explained, the difference of the minimal temperature in each latitude is much smaller than the ones that appear in the graph of http://www.diviner.ucla.edu/science.shtml
  I guess this has to do with with this effective depth not being quite right.]]></description>

 <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7915230/Luna/day%2C%20latitud%2045.png"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7915230/Luna/day%2C%20latitud%2045.png" style="max-width:100%;" /></a></p>
<p> The night equation is simpler, it  does not depend on the latitude </p>
<p>    <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac+%7BdT%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D+-%5Cfrac+%7B1%7D%7BH%2A%5Crho%2Ad%7D++%5Csigma++T%5E4+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;frac {dT}{d t} = -&#92;frac {1}{H*&#92;rho*d}  &#92;sigma  T^4 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>    here is a graph starting  the night at 220<br />
    <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7915230/Luna/noche%20Ti%3D220.png"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7915230/Luna/noche%20Ti%3D220.png" style="max-width:100%;" /></a></p>
<p>    and here is a graph starting  the night at 150<br />
    <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7915230/Luna/noche%20Ti%3D150.png"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7915230/Luna/noche%20Ti%3D150.png" style="max-width:100%;" /></a></p>
<p>    Note that in the equation  there is no 4 as I thought before, this is for two practical reasons and I would like to hear a good reason.<br />
    The first reason is that if I put here,  I should put it also  in the day equation. But then the maximum noon temperature would be much less than the observed one,  in fact changing the value of the thermodynamical equilibrium. The other reason is that if a leave it I don&#8217;t get reasonable temperatures,  in order to adjust to get reasonable temperatures I  have to adjust the effective depth to something like 40 cm. Which for some reason  I think is to much.  </p>
<p>   The following is nice: Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_f&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="T_f" class="latex" /> the composition of the two dynamics, a map from $[0,390 ]$ to itself. We start from some temperature and after 29.5 days we have another temperature. By elementary calculus -the mean value theorem- there is a fixed point, this fix point corresponds ti a periodic orbit. Moreover the transformation is a huge contraction, as we observed before more or less independently of the initial morning temperature we arrive near the maximum, the cooling is also contraction  so there is only one fixed point, so the periodic orbit is an attractor. </p>
<p>   There is something that still is not very well explained, the difference of the minimal temperature in each latitude is much smaller than the ones that appear in the graph of <a href="http://www.diviner.ucla.edu/science.shtml" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.diviner.ucla.edu/science.shtml</a><br />
  I guess this has to do with with this effective depth not being quite right.</p>

Hi John 

You are right lets do first the  energy balance  in a square meter in the equator, knowing the temperature. 
Let $latex S_0$  (1370) be the sun power per square meter,  and $latex A$ be  the number of seconds (1274400)  in  half a cycle (29.5 days) .  If  we start in the lunar morning the effective  power  as function of time should be something like
$latex S_0\sin \frac {\pi}{A}t $

So the received energy in a cycle  is
$latex \int_0^A S_0\sin \frac {\pi}{A}t dt$.
Which is one of the few integrals I can do, $latex \frac {2}{\pi }S_0A $. So a square meter in  the equators moon receives  $latex 1.11 \times 10^9$ Joules in a  moon cycle.


Now the  for the emitted radiation, we have to interpret the graphs of the temperature in http://www.diviner.ucla.edu/science.shtml
The graph is very flat in  the minimum, a consequence of   the moon cooling down very quickly.  To the resolution of my eyes looks that   all night has roughly the minimum value.  
So I propose to a first approximation  $latex T(t)= 280\sin \frac {\pi}{A}t + 100 $ for the day and $latex T(t)=100 $ in the night. 
The emitted  energy is then


$latex \int_0^A \sigma( 280\sin \frac {\pi}{A}t +100)^4 dt + A\sigma 100^4$

This integral can be done but it is easier to evaluate in a online calculator 
http://www.numberempire.com/ and gives $latex 6.65 \times 10^8$. The second term, the night radiation, is of order $latex 10^6$ so doesn&#039;t change significantly the answer. 

So the emitted radiation is only around $latex 60 \%$ of the received. We can push  the minimum night to only 7 days and adjust the $latex \sin $ function to cover 22 days, which I think is way to much, and we would get then something around $latex  90 \% $.  Is this equal enough to not be confused?]]></description>
