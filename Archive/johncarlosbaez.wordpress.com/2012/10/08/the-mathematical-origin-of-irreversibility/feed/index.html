					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/10/08/the-mathematical-origin-of-irreversibility/#comment-112053&quot;&gt;Patrick O&#039;Neill&lt;/a&gt;.

Sorry, the last comment had formatting issues.

Ok, I think I figured it out.  The problem actually arises from the fact that the initial distribution $latex \pi_0$ is degenerate.  To see how this comes up, recall the setup above where we start in state $latex A$ and run the process to stationarity.  Now in the penultimate step in the derivation of the integral fluctuation theorem, we have:

$latex \displaystyle\sum_\omega P(\omega^\dagger) = \displaystyle\sum_\omega \exp(-\Delta_i(\omega) + \Sigma(\omega)) P(\omega).$

If $latex \pi_0(B) = 0$, then $latex \Delta_i(\omega)$ is undefined for any trajectory $latex \omega$ such that $latex \omega_0 = B$.  One might hope to sweep this detail under the rug, since $latex \omega_0 = B$ implies $latex P(\omega) = 0$, leaving our sum undefined only on a set of measure zero.  But notice how the RHS expands:

$latex \displaystyle\sum_\omega \exp(-\Delta_i(\omega) + \Sigma(\omega)) P(\omega)\\ = \displaystyle\sum_\omega \exp(-(-\log(\pi_N(\omega_N)) - (- \log(\pi_0(\omega_0)))) + \Sigma(\omega)) P(\omega)\\ = \displaystyle\sum_\omega \exp(\log(\pi_N(\omega_N)) - \log(\pi_0(\omega_0)))) + \Sigma(\omega)) P(\omega)\\ = \displaystyle\sum_\omega \frac{\pi_N(\omega_N)}{\pi_0(\omega_0)} \exp(\Sigma(\omega)) \pi_0(\omega_0)\tilde{P}(\omega), $

where $latex \tilde{P}(\omega)$ just collects every term in $latex P(\omega)$ except the probability of starting in the initial state $latex \omega_0$.  Then the RHS reduces to:

$latex \displaystyle\sum_\omega \pi_N(\omega_N) \exp(\Sigma(\omega)) \tilde{P}(\omega).$

So it looks like these measure-zero trajectories are still sneaking in to contribute to the sum, at least if you define the sum for degenerate choices of $latex \pi_0$ to be the limit of the sum as $latex \pi_0$ approaches the desired initial conditions.  Or something like that?  In either case, summing over all trajectories (and not merely those that begin in state $latex A$) gives me the correct answer.  This strikes me as somewhat spooky, but it seems to work.

Anyway, thanks again Matteo and John for revisiting this!]]></description>

Hi Matteo,

Thanks very much for the reply!  I think I&#039;m still stuck, though.  I get that the expectation is over all trajectories, but it seems to me that in a two state system, the sum over trajectories can still be computed by grouping the trajectories according to their terminal states.

This should work because, for reasons outlined above, $latex \Sigma $ and $latex \Delta_i $ depend only on the terminal state.  (This is of course not true in general-- for three or more states you can have loops that make net contributions to the skewness.)

So if $latex \Sigma $ and $latex \Delta_i $ depend only on the terminal state, then you should be able to simply figure out how much probability mass ends up at each state, and sum over states.  Each state collects an uncountably infinite number of trajectories, sure, but they all carry the same contribution to the sum so you shouldn&#039;t have to keep track of them individually.  At least, not in the two state case.

But let me see if I can simplify the argument even further.  Every trajectory $latex \omega$ ends either in state $latex A$ or state $latex B$.  If it ends in $latex A$, its contribution to the sum is $latex \frac{2}{3}$, weighted by whatever the probability density is.  If it ends in $latex B$, then its contribution is also $latex \frac{2}{3}$ weighted by its density.  So no matter what measure we assign to the trajectories, it&#039;s hard to see how we can get to unity when integrating over them.

I&#039;ve also tried Monte Carlo simulations to check my work. In that case I&#039;m explicitly sampling trajectories, but I&#039;m still getting the same answer.

Anyway, thanks again for your response to a comment on a five year old blog post, and my apologies if I&#039;m missing something obvious.]]></description>

Hi Patrick!

The fluctuation theorem involves an average over trajectories, not over states. To check it explicitly in this example, you would have to consider a sum with infinite many terms (and not two as you write), each one corresponding to a possible trajectory of the system.

I hope this helps.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for a really interesting article, Matteo.

I&#039;m trying to illustrate these theorems for myself with a toy example, and I&#039;m having some trouble.  Perhaps someone might be able to point out the problem with my math.

Suppose we have a system with two states, $latex A$ and $latex B$, where $latex \gamma_{AB} = 1$ and $latex \gamma_{BA}=2$.  From the detailed balance condition $latex \pi_A(\infty) \gamma_{AB} = \pi_B(\infty)\gamma_{BA}$, we know that the stationary probabilities are $latex \pi_A(\infty) = \frac{2}{3}$ and $latex \pi_B(\infty) = \frac{1}{3}$.

Suppose we begin the process in state $latex A$, (i.e. $latex \pi_A(0) = 1, \pi_B(0) = 0$) and let it run for an infinitely long period of time.  What will the skewness and variation in self-information be when we next examine the process?  There are two cases to consider:

If the system is in state $latex A$, then the skewness $latex \Sigma$ will be

$latex (\gamma_{AB} + \gamma_{BA}) + \cdots + (\gamma_{AB} + \gamma_{BA}) = 0$

and

$latex \Delta i = -\ln(\frac{2}{3}) - \ln(1) = -\ln(\frac{2}{3})$

This case occurs with probability $latex \frac{2}{3}$.

If the system is in state $latex B$, then the skewness $latex \Sigma$ will be

$latex (\gamma_{AB} + \gamma_{BA}) + \cdots + (\gamma_{AB} + \gamma_{BA}) + \gamma_{AB}= \ln(2)$

and

$latex \Delta i = -\ln(\frac{1}{3}) - \ln(1) = -\ln(\frac{1}{3})$

This case occurs with probability $latex \frac{1}{3}$.

Then we have:

$latex \langle \exp(-\Delta i + \Sigma)\rangle = \frac{2}{3}\exp(\ln(\frac{2}{3}) + 0) + \frac{1}{3}\exp(\ln(\frac{1}{3}) + \ln(2)) = \frac{2}{3}\times\frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{3}\times\frac{2}{3} = \frac{2}{3} &#060; 1$

I would be the first to assume that the problem lies somewhere in my arithmetic.  But I checked it by hand and with simulation, and can&#039;t find the flaw.  And if it is an arithmetic error, it&#039;s not a simple sign error: I checked all of $latex \langle \exp(\pm\Delta i \pm \Sigma)\rangle$ and still couldn&#039;t get it to come out right.  But I&#039;d still be grateful to be proven wrong.

Or maybe there&#039;s an issue with the definition of skewness?  In particular, $latex \sigma_0(\tau_0)$ doesn&#039;t seem to be well-defined since $latex a_{j-1}$ is not defined.  So I just interpreted $latex \Sigma$ to be sum of the lograthmic ratio of the reverse and forward transition rates, over all transitions.  But maybe that&#039;s wrong?

Thanks in advance for any light anyone might be able to shed here.]]></description>

We&#039;ve had a good quick explanation of it here on Azimuth:

We&#039;ve also gotten a proof, where it was called the &#039;integral fluctuation theorem&#039;:

• Matteo Smerlak, &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/10/08/the-mathematical-origin-of-irreversibility/&quot;&gt;The mathematical origin of irreversibility&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Azimuth&lt;/i&gt;, 8 October 2012.

It&#039;s a fundamental result in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics---a subject where &lt;em&gt;inequalities&lt;/em&gt; are so common that this equation is called an &#039;equality&#039;.

Two days ago, Jarzynski gave an incredibly clear hour-long tutorial on this subject, starting with the basics of thermodynamics and zipping forward to modern work.  With his permission, you can see the slides here:
