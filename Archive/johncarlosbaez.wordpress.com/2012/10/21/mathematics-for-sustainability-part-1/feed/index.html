Progress continues in quantum gravity; I just heard today about &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.0522&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Eugenio Bianchi&#039;s new paper&lt;/a&gt;, which is a worthy successor to his &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.5122&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;recent calculations of black hole entropy using spin foams&lt;/a&gt;.  It&#039;s a subject that requires tremendous persistence and patience, but luckily it&#039;s a subject that will always be there waiting for us.]]></description>

It sounds like a very interesting (and useful) course.  I look forward to seeing how your thinking on it progresses.  On the off-chance that you haven&#039;t heard of them already, you might want to look at the books &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books/about/Guesstimation.html?id=nttR5Ibb7j4C&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Guesstimation: Solving the World&#039;s Problems on the Back of a Cocktail Napkin&lt;/a&gt; by Weinstein and Adam and &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books/about/Consider_a_Spherical_Cow.html?id=w59Rc08_7NwC&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Consider a Spherical Cow: A Course in Environmental Problem Solving&lt;/a&gt; by John Harte.  Both are basically worked examples followed by related problems.  Guesstimation seems to cover a lot of the ground that you&#039;re calling &quot;Measuring&quot; and Consider a Spherical Cow has a lot of stock-flow problems that might go well with what you&#039;re calling &quot;Changing.&quot;  While Guesstimation is meant for the general reader, Consider a Spherical Cow is meant for upper level students in environmental sciences, so you probably wouldn&#039;t want students in a Gen Ed course to try reading it.  But some of the problems might be adaptable to your course.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well, you are probably already be familiar with it, but just in case you are not let me give a quick plug to Marty Walter&#039;s recently published textbook &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books/about/Mathematics_for_the_Environment.html?id=ZY6BQgAACAAJ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Mathematics for the Environment&lt;/a&gt; as well as the (outdated) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.colorado.edu/math/earthmath/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;web page&lt;/a&gt; for the course he developed at the University of Colorado. Marty has been working on this for a while so he would certainly be a good resource.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great idea, the whole area of sustainability and climate adaptation needs some stronger analytical support. 

The great news now is the easy availability of reanalysis data sets on which to base some practical assignments, the amazing variety of R software (e.g. Revolution Analytics platforms) and the active groups such as those of Richard Katz and Richard Smith in the USA and Leonard Smith in the UK on the statistics side of sustainability applications. 

I would be keen to help.  My partner and I used to teach Maths/physics at university level before setting up our own consultancy company in environmental and forecasting aspects of indusrty planning. 

I am interested in the applied risk side of sustainability, especially innovative insurance options for agricultural planning under climate variability and change.  A recent talk to a group of CEOs in Brisbane can be found at:

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;img src=&quot;http://calvarysc.publishpath.com/Websites/calvarysc/Images/Doulos/Faith%20For%20Thought/Roe.jpg&quot; /&gt;

In case you&#039;re curious: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.math.psu.edu/roe/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;John Roe&lt;/a&gt; is a math professor at Penn State University who works on index theory (roughly the relation between the topology of manifolds and solutions of linear partial differential equations on these manifolds) and coarse geometry (roughly the study of geometrical properties of spaces that are visible at arbitrarily large distance scales).  He also likes rock-climbing, theology, guitar, ecology and economics.  And he&#039;s a member of the Azimuth Project!  

I think it&#039;s great for mathematicians to develop courses for undergraduates that help them develop the skills needed to reason clearly about economic and ecological issues.   I want to do it myself!  So, when he told us he was writing about this &lt;a href=&quot;http://points-of-inflection.blogspot.com/2012/10/mathematics-for-sustainability-1.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;over on his blog&lt;/a&gt;, I asked if I could crosspost it here, and he agreed.  

I hope all of you can come up with good suggestions to help him develop his course.  I probably need those suggestions even more than him!]]></description>
