How on earth can you find a tiny multi-year downward heat flux among the huge daily, monthly, seasonal and multi-year fluxes due to variations in local temperature, winds, currents, &quot;ninos&quot; etc with such an extremely sparse data?? 

It&#039;s enough that there are more probes in places where there is a local downward heat flux, while corresponding upward heat fluxes are less well sampled and you have your &quot;signal.&quot;

As for models, yes, we clearly disagree, until I see correct long term global climate *predictions* repeatedly work out I will treat all climate model predictions in that regime as random numbers.

While lawmakers do work with uncertainty judging by their actions so far they are clearly in my camp - the reliability of climate predictions is not even close to enough to warrant extreme costs associated with mitigation policies demanded by climate activists.

Finally as for climate sensitivity to claim that the measurements agree with your preferred 1.5 - 4.5 interval is to ignore reported confidence values. The proper conclusion one should draw is that climate sensitivity is simply not constant and therefore estimates based on reconstructed paleoclimate data are not applicable to present day. Incidentally that happens to remove all the high values from consideration and you end up with a value in the range of 1-2 C. Nothing to worry about.]]></description>

I completely disagree that the ocean data is too sparse to see a strong downward-penetrating heat signal.  The level of variability is not large enough to invalidate these conclusions; they are highly correlated over space.

Climate models have been tested on decadal to century timescales, though of course the further back you go, the fewer constraints you have.  But more than that, they have been tested extensively against base climatology, the seasonal cycle,   observations of individual feedback processes (water vapor, albedo, etc.) &#8212; which dominate the variability in long-term predictions, not the natural variability you seem so concerned with &#8212; and a wide variety of dynamical atmospheric-ocean processes (as well as against paleoreconstructions like Last Glacial Maximum).  It is ridiculous to claim that they are by default &quot;unreliable&quot;, and similarly ridiculous to claim that a physical model cannot be used for extrapolation, which is what your statements amount to.  It is impossible to &quot;prove&quot; a model&#039;s reliability in a new situation.  This doesn&#039;t mean that the model is inherently untrustworthy.  Models are used to extrapolate all the time.  This is their main function.

In short, I completely disagree that &quot;the test you admit nobody can run is precisely the test that is needed to verify that climate models can tell us anything useful about what hypothetical anthropogenic global warming will mean for the latter part of this century.&quot;  Assuming you&#039;re referring to some test of past century scale variability that hasn&#039;t already been run (e.g., with more detailed data), I don&#039;t agree that some dramatically more stringent test is required to be informative for climate policy.  

Decision makers don&#039;t work with &quot;proof&quot;.  They operate with uncertainty based on physically plausible extrapolation.  And frankly, the less you trust the models, the greater precaution you should take, because then you have even less grounds for ruling out the extreme outcomes that dominate the decision process.  Uncertainty doesn&#039;t work in anybody&#039;s favor.

Observations, paleodata, and climate models do agree on the likely range of climate sensitivity, which is generally taken to be 1.5-4.5 C.  This represents +/- 50% spread over the central estimate, but all these methods cluster in that same range.  You can&#039;t pick the few outliers and argue that they are all inconsistent with each other.]]></description>

I actually missed two even higher sensitivities in that table: 6 and 8 C degrees C per doubling!

Also looking at the reported confidence levels I am reminded of the old saying about astrophysicists being always wrong but never in doubt, it seems to apply to climate scientists these days.]]></description>

I had some time to take a look at World Ocean Database you mentioned. I picked all datasets except surface and selected the largest rectangular ocean area i was able to find: long -180.0 to -90.5; lat 10.0 to -69.5; (thats 14.4% of the Earth surface or 20% of ocean surface area i.e. 73 353 000 km2) selecting temperature data I got a total of 93470 casts or profiles during 25 years starting in jan 1962. Now to get a feeling for how well said area is covered lets see what would be cast density if we assumed that said points form an uniform grid. First lets assume there are 12 casts per year, that seems like way too little but just for the sake of the argument, that would give us 7789 casts per 73353000 km2 or 1 cast for 9417 km2. 

Sorry, but to me such sparse data are completely inadequate to draw any firm conclusions about global ocean heat fluxes. The signal you may be seeing in one place may be completely offset by another opposite signal in another place where you simply don&#039;t have the data. What makes you think you can get around this?

As for models of course the test you admit nobody can run is precisely the test that is needed to verify that climate models can tell us anything useful about what hypothetical anthropogenic global warming will mean for the latter part of this century. If they were never tested on this timescale why should anyone take anything they say about it seriously? And contrary to what you say all complex models are unrealiable unless proven otherwise, especially as complex as global climate ones.

Finally observations, paleodata, simple climate models and so on certainly do NOT agree on likely climate sensitivities, in fact sensitivities reported in the literature are all over the map, from completely harmless 0.7C to absurd 5.2C (and those are medians of reported ranges) per CO2 doubling.

We do have maps of ocean temperatures over the last 50 years; see the World Ocean Database.  They are most accurate to the upper 700 meters, but this is where most of the signal is.

I didn&#039;t say that this alone rules out the possibility of noise.  I said it largely rules out the possibility of the noise coming from ocean variability:  it&#039;s a top-down penetration pattern showing large integrated heat fluxes from the atmosphere.

And don&#039;t put words into my mouth.  Climate models are not untested -- they are extensively tested, though of course nobody can run the most relevant test (massively increase CO2 under present-day conditions and wait to see what happens).  Nor are they generically &quot;unreliable&quot;.  They are good at some aspects of the climate, and not as good as others.  Quite frankly, you don&#039;t even need a complex climate model to advocate interventions into global economy as a risk management approach (not that most climate scientists are policy advocates to begin with).  Historical observations, paleodata, simple climate models, and complex climate models all agree on the same range of likely climate sensitivities to carbon dioxide.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;As for the vineyards any arguments based on them first have to establish that we are talking about the same grape varieties.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Usually this subtle detail gets overlooked in the &quot;debate&quot;. I should have added the following 2nd scholium:

The medieval motivation to produce wine at northern latitudes was its necessity for catholic eucharist, where it transubstantiates into the blood of Christ (and not just consubstantiate as in Lutheranism). For this act of metaphysical cannibalism the wine&#039;s taste is irrelevant. Today the motivation is pure hedonism and it needs to have sufficient taste to compete with cheap southern imports. (E.g. Blaxsta vineyard is not only growing the quite winter hardy white Vidal, but also Chardonnay, Merlot and Cabernet Franc.)]]></description>

Somewhat digressing from the original topic of this post, i.e. climate science, and moving toward economic sciences (with psychology involved instead of physics and chemistry):

Are we sure that

&lt;blockquote&gt;
interventions into global economy
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

are always bad?

For example, can regulations (and control of those) save fish stocks by preventing overfishing? Belief in the invisible hand only sounds - at least to me - like belief in the aether theory.]]></description>

Where can we see this strong signal? Are you saying we have detailed 3d maps of ocean temperatures during last 50 years? 

Also you still didn&#039;t address the main point - how do you know that the strong signal you see is not also noise? How do you rule out low frequency noise? 

And while climate scientists might be aware that their models are untested and unreliable they never mention it in their public communications (the whole &quot;science is settled&quot; fiasco) and it doesn&#039;t stop them from advocating massive interventions into global economy based on them. 

That said by climate scientists I don&#039;t mean you or John, I admit Azimuth is very honest about various issues when they are brought up even though you do (of course) seem somewhat biased in AGW favor to me.

As for the vineyards any arguments based on them first have to establish that we are talking about the same grape varieties.]]></description>

<p>Where can we see this strong signal? Are you saying we have detailed 3d maps of ocean temperatures during last 50 years? </p>
