The only problem is that grading on a curve is obviously a cooperative game, where the students&#039; optimal strategy is not what you as teachers would want them to do. I usually discuss both grading on a curve and the &quot;cheating game&quot; (in tests) as examples in my Game Theory classes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/12/14/game-theory-for-undergraduates/#comment-23486&quot;&gt;murphmath&lt;/a&gt;.

I&#039;ve been imagining various slightly evil but educational in-class games.  I also have another evil idea.  

Anyone who teaches large classes will know that some students doing badly in the course will ask, desperately, near the end of the course, if there&#039;s &quot;any way they can improve their grade&quot;.  Usually I say a polite version of &quot;Yeah---learn the fucking stuff!&quot;  

Of course they meant to ask if there&#039;s any &lt;i&gt;other&lt;/i&gt; way to improve their grade.  But in this class I could offer them the chance to play some sort of game.  If they win, I will increase their grade by one letter.  If they lose, I&#039;ll decrease it by that much.  

If I did this right, winning the game would actually demonstrate mastery of game theory, so this would be justified.  Or, in a more evil variation, expertise in game theory would let the student realize that they shouldn&#039;t play the game, because they were likely to lose!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s a slightly evil in-class game: grade the course on a curve and have the students grade each other&#039;s work. (It might be nicer to conduct this as a thought experiment about some bizarro game theory course.)]]></description>

Thanks for the pointer.  I&#039;d heard you were writing about ordinals from a colleague, but since I&#039;ve only been following the blog, I never saw that myself.]]></description>

I&#039;ll keep that in mind!  I think most of the students want a course to fill out their electives for the math major.  But they will wind up learning a lot and also having fun---there will be games in class.  Not infinite ones, I&#039;m afraid.

The &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; problem (for people like you) is that, as far as I know, U.C. Riverside doesn&#039;t offer a course on mathematical logic and set theory that goes beyond the basics.  Our one logician hopped over to computer science when that department was created.  Smart move.  But we&#039;re weak when it comes to the infinite.  

You might like my posts about &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.google.com/u/0/s/%23bigness%20baez&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;bigness&lt;/a&gt; over on Google+.  Eventually I&#039;ll move them over here, and they&#039;ll be easier to read in sequence.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When I took game theory as a senior at U of A, I was extremely disappointed at the lack of infinite games (so disappointed I eventually dropped the class).

That stuff looks great!  I hope you don&#039;t take it down: unless I&#039;m miscalculating, the prestige value of having it publicly available is likely to exceed the monetary value of selling all the rights to a publisher.  Ever since I realized this, I make sure all my stuff is freely available online.  Publishers will usually still publish things under these terms.

Anyway, I&#039;ll try to get my students to use it.  ]]></description>
