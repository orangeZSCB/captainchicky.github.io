					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;Despite these dramatic changes, Lacey says “we waste around 85% of the energy produced in the U.S.” But he doesn’t say how that number was arrived at. Does anyone know?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Purely speculative, but it sounds like a ballpark figure for automobile transportation inefficiency. Transportation overall is about 75% &#039;wasteful&#039;. Per the following LLNL energy flow chart, all US Energy comes in at about 57% waste.

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/02/13/azimuth-on-google-plus-part-6/#comment-13658&quot;&gt;G.R.L. Cowan&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks, G.R.L.  I tend to trust sourced data more than anecdotal accounts, so I&#039;m afraid Thomas&#039; comment:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Will Germany buy more nuclear energy from France – especially in winter? Actually, it’s the other way round. In particular in winter, France is importing electricity from Germany.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

pales beside the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.entsoe.eu/db-query/exchange/electricity-exchange-of-a-specific-range-of-time/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity&lt;/a&gt; data saying France exported 1498 gigawatt-hours to Germany in December 2011, and got 4 gigawatt-hours back.  If the data is wrong or misleading, it should be possible to find better data.  

(I just checked and it&#039;s not some special feature of December 2011.  According to this website, throughout the year France sends a lot more electric power to Germany than the other way around---though usually just about 15 times as much, not 370 times as much as in last December.)

By the way: I&#039;m not trying to start a fight about nuclear power here.  I&#039;m just wondering what Germany&#039;s goal for decarbonization is, and how they plan to meet it.  Tim says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The following goals are laid down by law: The share of renewable energies in total gross electricity consumption will be increased to at least 30% by 2020.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.trust.org/alertnet/news/falling-solar-prices-good-for-climate-bad-for-firms/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;source I quoted&lt;/a&gt; says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Germany has added 14,000 megawatts capacity in the last 2 years and now has 24,000 megawatts in total—enough green electricity to meet nearly 4% the country’s power demand. That is expected to rise to 10% by 2020. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So, which forms of renewable energy will supply the remaining 30% - 10% = 20%  of Germany&#039;s electric power by 2020? 

Or is there some discrepancy somewhere?  For example, might the &#039;expected&#039; amount of renewable energy in various forms be less than what&#039;s &#039;laid down in law&#039;?]]></description>

Thanks for the detailed feedback, Uwe!

I&#039;ve been trying reactivate Cameron Smith.  Maybe your comment will help.  Tim van Beek has a post almost ready on fluid dynamics. I would love to get lots of people putting up regular posts here on biology, climate physics, energy policy, etc., but apparently it&#039;s very hard for most people to keep up a steady stream of blog posts.  For example, Cameron got distracted by his work on theoretical biology: too busy thinking to blog, it seems!

So, I urge you (and everyone else) to check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://planet3.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Planet3.0&lt;/a&gt;.  This is a blogger&#039;s collective, of which Azimuth is part!  You&#039;ll see lots of stuff there.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I also remember you writing about bad science practices e.g. Chaos, Solitons &#038; Fractals. That was much more focused than the current clash with Elsevier and really fun to read.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was fun to read, and fun to write, but then the editor of that journal started suing people and threatening to sue me, and it became much less fun.  The Elsevier boycott has been more productive, because it&#039;s led to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Mathforge/Math2.0/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Math 2.0&lt;/a&gt; and other initiatives which I&#039;ll be teling everyone about soon.  

Thanks for catching that typo; I&#039;ll fix it!]]></description>

The quantropy cycle currently is the highlight. Hopefully you will soon discuss the hydrogen atom (in part 4?).

					<description><![CDATA[There are a number of points worth knowing about the situation in Germany. In particular, there is a cap in the law that limits the amount of newly installable renewable electricity generation capacity in any given year. Technically, I think one can exceed the cap, but grid operators are then not obliged to allow you to feed it in at the agreed tariff for renewable energy.

Additionally, concerning wind power, where to site it always is an issue in densely populated Germany. So, there are plans that designate &quot;preferred areas&quot;. The political battle going on in Germany right now is that certain political forces - in particular the libertarian party in our present conservative/libertarian government - actively fight wind energy by trying to designate areas as &quot;preferred&quot; that do not have sufficient wind to make them interesting for power generation - thus also blocking the opportunity to set them up in &quot;non-preferential areas&quot; where it actually would make sense.

Incidentally, this very same party - our German Ayn Rand fans, it seems - also supports climate change denial propaganda activities. The interesting thing about that party is that, while they still sit in the government, they have become so massively unpopular that poll results show them on par with the large zoo of mostly unknown splinter parties.

Ad nuclear:

The decision to phase out nuclear power in favour of renewables was made under the previous social-democrat/ecological party government. Our present conservative/libertarian government first tried to substantially modify that decision in a way that just stopped short of reverting it. But then, immediately after Fukushima, Chancellor Merkel changed her mind and reverted that revert, and actually considerably accelerated phasing out nuclear.

Will Germany buy more nuclear energy from France - especially in winter? Actually, it&#039;s the other way round. In particular in winter, France is importing electricity from Germany. The problem is that the economics (and to some extent technology) of nuclear power makes this a somewhat unflexible power source - not easily ramped up and down. But the French are using electricity a lot for heating. Winter last year, France could not import enough electricity via international transmission lines and hat to cut off two million customers as an emergency measure. Even this winter, with many German nuclear power plants standing still, France is importing electricity from Germany. The German electricity suppliers did - just days ago - switch on some fossil powered plants normally standing still as an emergency measure. (So, the best thing to do something about this strange situation probably would be to get the French to stop abusing electricity for heating rather than properly insulating homes.)

Personally, looking at my own January electricity meter (the feed-in meter, that is) readings, solar power did amazingly well this winter.]]></description>
