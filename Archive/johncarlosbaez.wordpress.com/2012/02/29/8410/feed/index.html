					<description><![CDATA[The main point is that today, with the help of computers, authors do a lot of work that once was done by the publishers. Since publishers are provided with LaTeX-files of high quality instead of manuscripts that only experts can decipher, the question is what kind of value do they provide? Not as much as 50 years ago, that&#039;s for sure.

I think that an online journal would even be safer with respect to archiving the articles, than a commercial company. What happens to the rights of papers published by Elsevier if they go broke?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You said it right, John, papers are &quot;money&quot; for scientists. And scientific publishers have been smart enough to position themselves as &quot;banks&quot;. It is difficult to fight banks, as the Wall Street protesters have learned. But, in this case, the main problem is with the mind of scientists. They are conservative and they tend to stick to the old ways. I know this; I was working at free access publishing already in the 1990s. It didn&#039;t work. Eventually, though, it will.

Let&#039;s not talk about that here: I have plenty of blog entries that are more suitable for comments about that.  But try reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.skepticalscience.com/a-comprehensive-review-of-the-causes-of-global-warming.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.  

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I think the more physics and mathematics are published in open journals, the quicker the “evil publishers” will go out of business.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Indeed!  Before publishing papers, people should check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=browse&#038;uiLanguage=en&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Directory of Open Access Journals&lt;/a&gt; and the stupidly named but actually very useful &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/journalbrowse.php?la=en&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;SHERPA/RoMEO&lt;/a&gt; website, which rates journals.  

(Stupidly named, because the acronym does not suggest what the site is about!  When you read &#039;SHERPA/RoMEO&#039;, do you think &#039;open access journals&#039;?  No, you think &#039;romantic Nepalese mountaineers&#039;.  And they don&#039;t even say what the bloody acronym means on the bloody &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/about.php?fIDnum=&#124;&#038;mode=simple&#038;la=en&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&#039;about&#039;&lt;/a&gt; page.  But apart from that, it&#039;s a good webapage.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[First of all: thanks for your blog, I love it! 
 
But I don&#039;t completely believe in the A of AGW.. :)

I think the more physics and mathematics are published in open journals, the quicker the &quot;evil publishers&quot; will go out of business.

It will be difficult to separate the wriff-wraff and &quot;crackpwuts&quot; from people like me (just kidding); but even bad/random information can create a spark!

So, the more information, the better; bring it ON!!]]></description>
