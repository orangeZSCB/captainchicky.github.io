					<description><![CDATA[The Academic Spring is not over! The heads of 11 major midwestern US universities have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.insidehighered.com/views/2012/02/23/essay-open-access-scholarship&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;come out in favor of open access&lt;/a&gt;. Besides arguing for the Federal Public Access Act&#8212;which you should all support! - they say:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As the chief academic officers of our universities, we believe that a fundamental conflict around the value of open access to research was at the root of the recent call by university faculty worldwide to boycott Elsevier Publishing for practices that undermine the ability of scholars to share their work. We don’t take any pleasure in our faculty turning away from trusted outlets for publishing their research, and neither do the faculty themselves. Nonetheless, &lt;b&gt;when researchers feel that the channels of scholarly publishing are not enhancing scholarship, or serving the public good, they will act to recalibrate the balance between commerce and the broader goals to which they are dedicated&lt;/b&gt;. By pledging to withhold their services as authors, editors and peer reviewers, these several thousand faculty members have posted an important reminder to all of us that &lt;b&gt;publishing is a means to social betterment, and not a goal unto itself.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[You mention that someone with technical savvy should make it easy to contact congress about this bill. I would suggest contacting http://demandprogress.org/ and asking if they&#039;ll help out with this cause-- they have a flashy website where you can send messages to congress with a click, or, equally fast, find your representative&#039;s number. They also have a very large list of subscribers and can get the word out quickly.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For the record, similar legislation to this new version of the FRPAA has been introduced at least three times and died. First by, then independent, Lieberman as S. 1373 died on June 25, 2009, second by republican Tiahrt  as H.R. 5253 died May 6, 2010, and most recently by democrat Doyle as H.R. 5037 died April 15, 2010. Now, Doyle is reintroducing something very similar to the dead H.R. 5037. To voice your opinion, I would recommend popvox: http://www.popvox.com . The new version of H.R. 5037 is not yet available there, but I&#039;m sure it will be soon. In the meantime, you could suggest reintroducing H.R. 5037 on popvox.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Exactly right John,
We have to pool our energy. It&#039;s hard, as it takes us away from what we are wanting to do. But for the last five years I have been spending 50% of my time fighting to get science published Openly. Unfortunately for us as individuals we have to invest effort for the future. But it will pay off.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very good work you are doing, John. I try to help with my blog; I wrote something on open access publishing at:

http://cassandralegacy.blogspot.com/2012/01/open-access-science.html

I received a few perplexed comments from scientists. The &quot;money&quot; value of published papers remains entrenched with the scientific community. It will take some time to change it, but the movement in that direction is unmistakable. 

And congratulations for your excellent blog!]]></description>
