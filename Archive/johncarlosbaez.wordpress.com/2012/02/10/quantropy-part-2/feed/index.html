Funny, I heard a different and interesting etymology (probably from QI). Old (Hornby?) train sets used to come in two versions which were written &#039;box standard&#039; and &#039;box deluxe&#039;, these were so so common that they got converted and distorted into the negative and positive phrases: &#039;bog standard&#039; and &#039;the dog&#039;s bollocks&#039;.]]></description>

That sounds interesting.  I&#039;d call your quantity 

$latex E = A/t_0$ 

&#039;action per time&#039;, or &lt;b&gt;activity&lt;/b&gt;, or something.  I will investigate these different options soon.  It may be more fun after I explain an example of the formalism, namely the free particle.  Then we can get more of a feeling for these concepts.

By the way, this business about &#039;action = energy &#215; time&#039; is closely related to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/01/23/classical-mechanics-versus-thermodynamics-part-2/#comment-12718&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Blake Stacey&#039;s observation&lt;/a&gt; that in classical mechanics, conjugate quantities multiply to give something with units of action, while in thermodynamics, they multiply to give something with units of energy.   This should ultimately resolve the puzzle of &#039;if we try to quantize thermodynamics, what takes the place of Planck&#039;s constant?&#039;... though I can say I see how yet.]]></description>

I like that idea even better.  What both of them have in common is that lambda is the ratio of the time traversing the path to the time for a complete quantum vibration.  

This is related to the ability to accurately determine the pitch of a note: it&#039;s much more important to get your fingers in exactly the right place when you&#039;re bowing a bass than when you&#039;re plucking it.

It&#039;s also related to the variant of Heisenberg&#039;s inequality $latex \Delta E \Delta t \ge \hbar$, where we have an observable Q that does not commute with the Hamiltonian and we define $latex \Delta t$ to be the time that it takes the expected value of Q to change by one standard deviation.]]></description>
