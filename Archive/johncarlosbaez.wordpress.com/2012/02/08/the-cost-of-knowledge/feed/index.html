					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/02/08/the-cost-of-knowledge/#comment-13447&quot;&gt;John Baez&lt;/a&gt;.

Many of the open-access journals are using a &quot;teaser rate&quot; philosophy. The common approach for a publisher is to have a set of journals that covers dozens if not hundreds of disciplines. The publisher then starts by assigning no publication fee to solicited articles. The idea is that as soon as any one of the journals hits a critical mass, then they start charging a fee for that journal.  That has happened with many of the open-access journals with titles such as &quot;Energy&quot;, &quot;Entropy&quot;, etc. 

We have to acknowledge that some of the open-access journals are ideas from businessmen looking for easy money and promoting a truly &quot;coop&quot; review board system is a good path forward.]]></description>

This seems like an example of what happens when people add references to their own work to Wikipedia, not an example of the difficulties with open access publication.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Compared to using an official open-access journal, I don’t see any difference going the self-publishing route...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For professional academics there&#039;s an enormous difference: it means the difference between getting jobs and promotions and not getting them.  One major reason for journals these days is that they provide a way for universities to judge the quality of scholars&#039; work without having to read it, understand it, and be in a good position to judge its quality.  Publication in a &#039;good journal&#039; is a proxy for quality.

There is also the fact that peer review at journals helps correct papers and weed out some really bad ones.   So, for example, I can trust a paper in &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt; a bit more than something on someone&#039;s blog.  If I&#039;m really an expert in some field, it&#039;s usually better for me to actually look at the paper and make up my own mind.  But if I know nothing about the field, the journal&#039;s &#039;seal of approval&#039; can be helpful.

The people who hire and promote academics are typically closer to &#039;knowing nothing about the field&#039; than being &#039;experts&#039;; this is why they care so much where we publish our work.  I&#039;m trying to promote a system of &#039;review boards&#039; as a way around this.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks John, I appreciate the effort.  Last year I wrote a paper with a colleague that we submitted to one of the open access journals. It got accepted, with very little peer review, and because of problems with my employer footing the publishing charges, we never had to pay the $850 fee.  At the last moment I thought about paying on my own dime but then we figured that it is in their business model to publish papers that don&#039;t pay the fee. That is money down the drain anyways -- electrons are free, no one did any critical review, and the editing mark-up was minor. I felt bad about being a free-loader for a day or two, but I got over it.

That was my experience as an open-access supplier. I also want to discuss two other very recent experiences. One as a consumer, and another as a frustrated participant.

Over the weekend, I happened across an intriguing looking research paper published by Elsevier &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544211006694&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&quot;Shaping the global oil peak: A review of the evidence on field sizes, reserve growth, decline rates and depletion rates&quot;&lt;/a&gt; last month. This is right up up my alley, but not for $36. 

I will give you an example of why I think it will be a long tough slog ahead to get open access projects accepted.  Last year I finished up my long tome on the topic of oil depletion, largely culled from my blog postings since 2004. It has lots of practical and applied math and I have it hosted on Google Docs (free) and Google Books (preview) so anyone can look at it free of charge. Now the sticky point is that a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_oil&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Peak Oil&lt;/a&gt; Wikipedia article references a specific model of mine from the book. So today I try to add a citation and it gets removed within a day. I tried doing this once last year and now once again this year. The same gatekeeper removed the cite as before. I think I violated the arbitrary &quot;no original research&quot; and &quot;no self-published works&quot; rules of Wikipedia. (of course the Azimuth wiki does not have this issue :-)

Compared to using an official open-access journal, I don&#039;t see any difference going the self-publishing route, except for this very routine bang-your-head-against-the-wall frustration. 

Bottomline, I am thankful and appreciate that I can absolutely eat up all the unpublished material from Arxiv, here, and other sites, but the feeling does not seem to be widespread. The irony is that &lt;i&gt;open&lt;/i&gt; access has become a &lt;i&gt;secret&lt;/i&gt; storehouse of great ideas, that is unfortunately shut off from the obvious channels. You have to know where to look and then the world is your oyster.]]></description>
