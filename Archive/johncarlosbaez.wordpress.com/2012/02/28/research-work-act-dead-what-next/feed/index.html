					<description><![CDATA[ACM e-mailed information about the authorizer today, I think it is a very good step in the public access direction, and deserves mention here: 

&quot;You may be aware that ACM recently introduced ACM Author-Izer, a unique service which allows you to offer visitors to your home page free access to your ACM-published articles in the ACM Digital Library.

ACM Author-Izer gives you the ability to add a link to the definitive version of your article on either your personal web page or your institutional repository. This link will expand your article&#039;s accessibility to the worldwide computing community.

To use ACM Author-Izer you must first take ownership of your Author Profile page in the ACM Digital Library. To go to your Author Profile page click the link above, and then sign in with your ACM Web Account username and password. If you don&#039;t already have an Account, click &quot;Sign up&quot; from your Author Profile page. You can add personal information such as your photograph, homepage address, etc. Click “Add Author Information” to submit your changes. Once you receive email notification that your changes were accepted, you can use ACM Author-Izer.

See how the ACM Author-Izer service works.

We hope you will use this new service and inform friends and colleagues about its advantages.&quot;]]></description>

What is good for the goose, is good for the gander. I see no reason as to why research proposals should not be assessed anonymously.

To take any other position is hypocrisy. 

Who knows, in the world of the future, my research proposal to investigate time dependent quantum mechanics might be accepted on the basis of merit, not who I know, or who I&#039;m wiilling to corrupt for research dollars.]]></description>

I am a big fan of the open-access movement and think these new developments are great, but Nima&#039;s level of hostility goes way too far. There is *some* reasonable cost for publishing, distributing, and maintain archives of scientific literature forever. If Elsevier truly died, couldn&#039;t a lot of good scientific works already published there be lost?]]></description>

I&#039;m not saying it&#039;s &lt;i&gt;right&lt;/i&gt; that research proposals aren&#039;t evaluated anonymously.  I&#039;m saying that fixing that is not a prerequisite for the changes we&#039;re talking about in this thread -- a shift towards OA with the eventual goal of universal OA.]]></description>

I felt uncomfortably reading the level of hostility in Nima&#039;s comment.  It took me a while to realise why.  It&#039;s because I&#039;ve spoken with individuals who work for Elsevier and are genuinely trying to do the right thing, and are not worthy of such hostility.  But they are working within a toxic company; and that company as a whole (at least as is is now) probably &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt;.  I hope Elsevier employees reading this (especially the ones I&#039;ve spoken with) will recognise and feel that distinction.

As for &quot;Forget boycotting Elsevier. Kill Elsevier!&quot; -- boycotting is what &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; kill Elsevier, just as surely as suffocation kills a mouse.  The company lives entirely on free donations of content and editorial/review services.  If we stop giving it that oxygen, it will have nothing to live on.

To survive, it&#039;s going to need to make much more radical changes than just &quot;we still want the RWA but we&#039;re withdrawing support for it because you were all so mean&quot;.  For more on this, seem my blog post of yesterday, &lt;a href=&quot;http://svpow.wordpress.com/2012/02/28/can-elsevier-save-itself/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Can Elsevier save itself?&lt;/a&gt;]]></description>

Tell me why students have to use numbers instead of names in exams and assignments to avoid bias, but research proposals are not assessed in an anonymous fashion. Double standard, much?]]></description>

The first is perfect.

Actually I wanted a small one included in some forum discussion. (Of course I could downsize the PDF, put it on my blog, and then link to that image from the forum post.)

But suppose I don&#039;t have a blog...

Now absolutely everybody can easily spread the message everywhere in any image size.]]></description>
