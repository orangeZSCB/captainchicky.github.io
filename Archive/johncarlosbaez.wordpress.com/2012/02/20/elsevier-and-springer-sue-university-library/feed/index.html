					<description><![CDATA[I thank you for promoting this action. The entire scientific enterprise is hobbled by sequestering research papers behind expensive portals. There can be no justification for charging $30 to $40 for one journal article.  I urge all researchers and authors to publish on the open and free sites. We have the Internet today in large part because all the standards documents and working papers were made available using the very medium being developed.

					<description><![CDATA[As an undergraduate from Polytechnic of Valencia, currently in Greece, I have been reading your blog for a couple of years, thinking how great it is, and wondering what could I do.

Now everybody can help. I just started sending mails to our librarians and directors to inform about this Ban and Open movement, and asking them to take part and lead this revolution in Spain, at least. I hope it helps.

Meanwhile, for protesting pacifically against cuts in education, underage students are being beaten and detained in Valencia....]]></description>

Here&#039;s how inter-library loan works at at least SOME universities in the USA, for papers from at least SOME publishers.

1. patron requests document
2. librarian obtains PDF from publisher
3. PDF is printed
4. PDF is deleted
5. Printed copy is scanned
6. Scan is converted to PDF
7. Scanned PDF is sent to patron.

It makes my head hurt just thinking about all that extra effort to DESTROY information.]]></description>

&quot;I cannot boycott Springer, at least not yet, given that I have a number of papers under submission in Springer journals.&quot;

Sure you can.  You can just decide now that you&#039;re not going to send them any &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; of your submissions.  You don&#039;t need to pull the ones you&#039;ve already submitted in order to make a statement.  (Mind, you just think what a statement that &lt;i&gt;would&lt;/i&gt; make!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When I read this in the original article:

&quot;In the legal proceedings, the aim must therefore be to strike a balance between the services provided by the ETH-Bibliothek for the benefit of science and research on the one hand and the commercial interests of the publishers on the other.&quot;

It made a shiver run up my spine.  There is it, in black and white.  One side, the benefit of science and research; on the other, the commercial interests of the publishers.  The two are opposed: what you give to one, you have to take away from the other.

... And we&#039;re talking about striking a &lt;i&gt;balance&lt;/i&gt;?  Seriously?  Is it even a question?  &quot;Let&#039;s retard the progress of science, so we can improve the commercial interests of publishers!&quot;  No, thank you.]]></description>
