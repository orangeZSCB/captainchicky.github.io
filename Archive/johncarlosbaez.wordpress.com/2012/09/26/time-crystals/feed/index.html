					<description><![CDATA[With all due respect to Frank Wilczek&#039;s outstanding talent and achievements, his &quot;proof&quot; of existence of a &quot;quantum time crystal&quot; is incorrect.

 In short, Wilczek proposed a model consisting of attractively coupled particles on an Aharonov-Bohm ring, and found a solution to the corresponding Schrödinger which (for non-zero Aharonov-Bohm flux) consists of a rotating lump, thus breaking symmetry with respect to time translation. 

However, Wilczek did not bother to prove that the solution he has found is really the ground state, i.e., that there exist no other states of lower energy.

Furthermore, one can show that, if correct, Wilczek result would lead to several paradoxical (unphysical) consequences. In particular, the classical behavior would not be recovered in the limit of infinitely large interactions, as it should, and the system would be able to radiate energy while being in its ground state, thereby violating the principle of energy conservation.

The true ground state can be found, is perfectly stationary, and does not lead to any unphysical paradox; this is discussed in detail in the following Comment: http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.4128

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/09/26/time-crystals/#comment-20445&quot;&gt;Daniel Walsh&lt;/a&gt;.

It&#039;s true that working on a spacetime cylinder, as shown in the photo in the blog article, eliminates Lorentz transformations: the only symmetries are translations of the time line and rotations of the space circle, and reflections in time, and reflections in space (and combinations of all of these).  

So, the symmetries of a spacetime cylinder are the same as the symmetries of an ordinary cylinder in space.

I once read an incredibly detailed book on crystallography, which classified the things like &#039;space groups&#039; for cylinders.  These are important for structures like &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotube&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;nanotubes&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Kohlenstoffnanoroehre_Animation.gif&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

So, this math is already out there, waiting for people who want to build spacetime crystals using rings of atoms.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In order to answer the question of the &quot;spacetime-groups&quot; maybe should study the 3D regular space group. It&#039;s thus tempting to believe that the spacetime-groups will be some kind of modification of the 3D crystallographic group when we add in the temporal dimension. As an analogy, consider the symmetry group of the infinite cylinder. It is useful to decompose the cylinder as a cartesian product of a circle and a line, so the symmetry group of the infinite cylinder is generated by rotations and translations about the axis.

I wonder if a similar thing happens with spacetime-groups.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/09/26/time-crystals/#comment-20320&quot;&gt;Aaron Denney&lt;/a&gt;.

You spotted a weak spot in my post.  I was talking about &#039;space groups&#039;.  These are certain discrete subgroups of the symmetries of Euclidean space.  So, it&#039;s somewhat artificial to classify spacetime crystals in terms of their space groups.  You can do it, but it probably makes more sense to look at subgroups of the symmetries of Galilean spacetime or Minkowski spacetime.  I don&#039;t know of work that&#039;s classified &#039;crystals&#039; in this way.

I might as well take this excuse to quote Wikipedia about &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_group&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&#039;space groups&#039;&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In n dimensions, an affine space group, or Bieberbach group, is a discrete subgroup of isometries of n-dimensional Euclidean space with a compact fundamental domain. Bieberbach (1911, 1912) proved that the subgroup of translations of any such group contains n linearly independent translations, and is a free abelian subgroup of finite index, and is also the unique maximal normal abelian subgroup. He also showed that in any dimension n there are only a finite number of possibilities for the isomorphism class of the underlying group of a space group, and moreover the action of the group on Euclidean space is unique up to conjugation by affine transformations. This answers part of Hilbert&#039;s 18th problem. Zassenhaus (1948) showed that conversely any group that is the extension of Z&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; by a finite group acting faithfully is an affine space group. Combining these results shows that classifying space groups in n dimensions up to conjugation by affine transformations is essentially the same as classifying isomorphism classes for groups that are extensions of Z&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; by a finite group acting faithfully.

It is essential in Bieberbach&#039;s theorems to assume that the group acts as isometries; the theorems do not generalize to discrete cocompact groups of affine transformations of Euclidean space. A counter-example is given by the 3-dimensional Heisenberg group of the integers acting by translations on the Heisenberg group of the reals, identified with 3-dimensional Euclidean space. This is a discrete cocompact group of affine transformations of space, but does not contain a subgroup Z&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since space groups are subgroups of the isometries of Euclidean space it may seem odd to classify them up to conjugation by affine transformations (which aren&#039;t necessarily isometries).  The reason is that if we have something like a triclinic crystal:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Triclinic.svg/129px-Triclinic.svg.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

we don&#039;t want to say its space group changes whenever we change the angles $latex \alpha, \beta, \gamma$ slightly... though of course it &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; change, by getting suddenly bigger, when some of these angles take the value 90&#176;.  Then we say the crystal isn&#039;t triclinic anymore: it belongs to some other, more symmetrical &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_system#Overview&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;crystal system&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Of course, time is different than space, but we can also imagine doing chemistry in a world where space has more or fewer than 3 dimensions, and since chemistry is a highly mathematical subject one can study it using equations rather than test tubes.  I sometimes hope that when the world has worked out a lot of its less urgent problems, chemists can have fun studying higher-dimensional chemistry.  

But there are basic questions about higher-dimensional chemistry that need to be settled before we start having have fun.  For example: in 4 dimensions, instead of $latex 1/r$ potential, electrostatic forces have a $latex 1/r^2$ potential

Classically a force with a $latex 1/r^2$ potential has &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_central-force_problem#Newton.27s_theorem_of_revolving_orbits&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;strange properties&lt;/a&gt;, first discovered by Newton.  

But for chemistry we need quantum mechanics!   It turns out that if the attractive force between charged particles blows up sufficiently intensely as they get close, atoms are quantum-mechanically unstable, so chemistry doesn&#039;t exist. 

Mathematically, the question is this: is the operator

$latex \displaystyle{ -\nabla^2 - \frac{k}{r^2} }$

self-adjoint in 4 dimensions?  I used to know this stuff, but I forget now, and the relevant book is still packed away---I just got back from Singapore.  I remember that in 3 dimensions,
the operator

$latex \displaystyle{ -\nabla^2 - \frac{k}{r^p} } $

is self-adjoint for $latex p &#060; 3/2$, while for $latex p = 3/2$ it&#039;s only self-adjoint when the number $latex k$ is smaller than (or equal to?) some constant.  Chemistry in 3 dimensions works fine because it uses $latex p = 1$.

I taught a course about this once and you can see proofs of some of these facts here:

&#8226; John Baez, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/quantum_theory_and_analysis/Q.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Quantum Theory and Analysis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, around page 55.

The beautifully delicate borderline case $latex p = 3/2$ can be found in the book I have packed away somewhere:

&#8226; Reed and Simon, &lt;i&gt;Methods of Modern Mathematical Physics, Vol. 2: Fourier Analysis, Self-Adjointness&lt;/i&gt;, Academic Press, 1978

But the exact power $latex p$ at which 

$latex \displaystyle{ -\nabla^2 - \frac{k}{r^p} }$

ceases to be self-adjoint depends strongly on the dimension of space, and I&#039;m forgetting the exact formula.  The answer will settle whether chemistry based on electrostatic attraction of oppositely charged particles can exist in 4d space.]]></description>

For example: in 4 dimensions, instead of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2Fr&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="1/r" class="latex" /> potential, electrostatic forces have a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2Fr%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="1/r^2" class="latex" /> potential</p>
<p>Classically a force with a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2Fr%5E2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="1/r^2" class="latex" /> potential has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_central-force_problem#Newton.27s_theorem_of_revolving_orbits" rel="nofollow">strange properties</a>, first discovered by Newton.  </p>
<p>But for chemistry we need quantum mechanics!   It turns out that if the attractive force between charged particles blows up sufficiently intensely as they get close, atoms are quantum-mechanically unstable, so chemistry doesn&#8217;t exist. </p>
<p>Mathematically, the question is this: is the operator</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+-%5Cnabla%5E2+-+%5Cfrac%7Bk%7D%7Br%5E2%7D+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ -&#92;nabla^2 - &#92;frac{k}{r^2} }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>self-adjoint in 4 dimensions?  I used to know this stuff, but I forget now, and the relevant book is still packed away&#8212;I just got back from Singapore.  I remember that in 3 dimensions,<br />
the operator</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+-%5Cnabla%5E2+-+%5Cfrac%7Bk%7D%7Br%5Ep%7D+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ -&#92;nabla^2 - &#92;frac{k}{r^p} } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>is self-adjoint for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p+%3C+3%2F2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p &lt; 3/2" class="latex" />, while for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p+%3D+3%2F2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p = 3/2" class="latex" /> it&#8217;s only self-adjoint when the number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" /> is smaller than (or equal to?) some constant.  Chemistry in 3 dimensions works fine because it uses <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p+%3D+1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p = 1" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>I taught a course about this once and you can see proofs of some of these facts here:</p>
<p>&bull; John Baez, <i><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/quantum_theory_and_analysis/Q.pdf" rel="nofollow">Quantum Theory and Analysis</a></i>, around page 55.</p>
<p>The beautifully delicate borderline case <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p+%3D+3%2F2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p = 3/2" class="latex" /> can be found in the book I have packed away somewhere:</p>
<p>&bull; Reed and Simon, <i>Methods of Modern Mathematical Physics, Vol. 2: Fourier Analysis, Self-Adjointness</i>, Academic Press, 1978</p>
<p>But the exact power <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="p" class="latex" /> at which </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+-%5Cnabla%5E2+-+%5Cfrac%7Bk%7D%7Br%5Ep%7D+%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ -&#92;nabla^2 - &#92;frac{k}{r^p} }" class="latex" /></p>
<p>ceases to be self-adjoint depends strongly on the dimension of space, and I&#8217;m forgetting the exact formula.  The answer will settle whether chemistry based on electrostatic attraction of oppositely charged particles can exist in 4d space.</p>
