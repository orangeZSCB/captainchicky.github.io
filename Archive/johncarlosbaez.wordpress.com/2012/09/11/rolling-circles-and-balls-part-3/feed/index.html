Hi there, sorry for the radio silence. I actually wrote up something in detail a few months ago using a different approach to you Greg, although based on the same idea of studying the critical points. Thanks for sharing yours!

I&#039;m now actually thinking that what I wrote should be publicly available,  (and perhaps would be good for my applications to math PhD programs). Of course I&#039;d cite the convo here and a conversation I had about this on stackexchange, as well as provide a link in the comments here for anyone following in future.

Do you or John have any advice on what the appropriate medium would be? I asked someone in the mathematics department at my university and they said that a colleague told them that it&#039;s a well-known result, but I still haven&#039;t seen a proof in any pure math journals (or physics or applied math for that matter).

Perhaps it&#039;s considered too simple? Maybe the arXiv or a blog post is the correct setting. What do you think?]]></description>

Very nice! - and it&#039;s also nice that the animation shows up here.  I don&#039;t think many mathematicians or physicists have this mental picture of the maximal torus of SU(3), though it&#039;s something a lot of us have thought about.

(The word &quot;the&quot; here is a bit irksome, but in a compact Lie group all maximal tori are conjugate to each other, so it&#039;s tolerable.  You&#039;re using the maximal torus that consists of all diagonal matrices in SU(3).)]]></description>

I should add that in the simplest case for which the trace is a 2-dimensional set, SU(3), there are only two kinds of curves of critical points, and they both map to the boundary deltoid.

I wish I could visualise how the projection of the (topological) 2-torus that is the SU(3) diagonal subgroup ends up being a deltoid, but it&#039;s a struggle to picture how it sits in $latex \mathbb{R}^6$, which I think is the smallest Euclidean space in which it can be embedded in such a way that the trace is an orthogonal projection.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/09/11/rolling-circles-and-balls-part-3/#comment-90370&quot;&gt;Greg Egan&lt;/a&gt;.

It turns out that things are much more complicated than I thought!  It&#039;s not true that all critical points project to the boundary.

Let&#039;s try to characterise the general case.  At a given point in the diagonal subgroup manifold, the projections of the coordinate tangent vectors onto the plane are:

$latex \mathrm{Tr}^*: \partial_{j} \mapsto $

$latex (-\sin(\phi_j) - \sin(\phi_1+ \cdots + \phi_{n-1}), \cos(\phi_j) - \cos(\phi_1+ \cdots + \phi_{n-1}))$

These vectors will all lie on the same unit circle in the plane, whose centre is displaced from the origin by a unit vector.  So that circle passes through the origin.

If this set of projections is rank-1, then all the vectors must lie on a line through the origin, but since they also lie on a circle that passes through the origin, there are only two possibilities:  zero, and some non-zero vector, say $latex v$, that gives the other point of intersection of the line with the circle.

For any vectors that are equal to $latex v$, their $latex \phi$ coordinates must all be the same; say their common value is $latex s$.  And whenever the vector for coordinate $latex j$ is zero, we must have:

$latex \displaystyle{\phi_j = -(\phi_1+ c\dots +\phi_{n-1})}$

We will write $latex t = \phi_1+ \cdots +\phi_{n-1}$, so for these zero vectors, $latex \phi_j = -t$.

Suppose $latex k$ of the $latex n-1$ vectors are equal to $latex v$ and $latex n-1-k$ are equal to zero.  Then we have:

$latex \displaystyle{t = k s - (n-1-k) t}$

$latex \displaystyle{t = \frac{k}{n-k} s}$

The projection of the curve containing the points is then:

$latex \displaystyle{C(s) = k \exp(i s) + (n-k) \exp(-i \frac{k}{n-k} s)}$

This gives the boundary hypocycloid when $latex k=n-1$ or $latex k=1$, but for other values of $latex k$ it gives curves that lie in the interior, except at the cusps.

For example, for $latex n=5$, the blue curve in the image below comes from $latex k=1,4$, while the orange curve comes from $latex k=2,3$.

<p>For any vectors that are equal to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="v" class="latex" />, their <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;phi" class="latex" /> coordinates must all be the same; say their common value is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="s" class="latex" />.  And whenever the vector for coordinate <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="j" class="latex" /> is zero, we must have:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B%5Cphi_j+%3D+-%28%5Cphi_1%2B+c%5Cdots+%2B%5Cphi_%7Bn-1%7D%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{&#92;phi_j = -(&#92;phi_1+ c&#92;dots +&#92;phi_{n-1})}" class="latex" /></p>
<p>We will write <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t+%3D+%5Cphi_1%2B+%5Ccdots+%2B%5Cphi_%7Bn-1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="t = &#92;phi_1+ &#92;cdots +&#92;phi_{n-1}" class="latex" />, so for these zero vectors, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi_j+%3D+-t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;phi_j = -t" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>Suppose <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" /> of the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n-1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n-1" class="latex" /> vectors are equal to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="v" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n-1-k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n-1-k" class="latex" /> are equal to zero.  Then we have:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7Bt+%3D+k+s+-+%28n-1-k%29+t%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{t = k s - (n-1-k) t}" class="latex" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7Bt+%3D+%5Cfrac%7Bk%7D%7Bn-k%7D+s%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{t = &#92;frac{k}{n-k} s}" class="latex" /></p>
<p>The projection of the curve containing the points is then:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7BC%28s%29+%3D+k+%5Cexp%28i+s%29+%2B+%28n-k%29+%5Cexp%28-i+%5Cfrac%7Bk%7D%7Bn-k%7D+s%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{C(s) = k &#92;exp(i s) + (n-k) &#92;exp(-i &#92;frac{k}{n-k} s)}" class="latex" /></p>
<p>This gives the boundary hypocycloid when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3Dn-1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k=n-1" class="latex" /> or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3D1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k=1" class="latex" />, but for other values of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" /> it gives curves that lie in the interior, except at the cusps.</p>
<p>For example, for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D5&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n=5" class="latex" />, the blue curve in the image below comes from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3D1%2C4&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k=1,4" class="latex" />, while the orange curve comes from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3D2%2C3&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k=2,3" class="latex" />.</p>

In general, there would be no reason why a critical point couldn&#039;t be mapped to the interior of the projection; you can imagine, say, taking a spherical balloon, poking your finger into one side, then projecting the deformed surface onto the ground.  Near the tip of your finger the surface would be vertical, but it would map to the interior of the projection.

So it does take an extra argument to see why the curve we get in the plane from either of the loops I mentioned must lie entirely on the boundary of the projection.  If we could show that &lt;i&gt;every&lt;/i&gt; critical point must project to the same hypocycloid, I think that would do it, but I can&#039;t see an easy proof of that off the top of my head.]]></description>
