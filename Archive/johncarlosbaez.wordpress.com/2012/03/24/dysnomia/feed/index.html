					<description><![CDATA[I believe tholins are more acetylenic than aromatic.    Titan&#039;s atmosphere has about 10000x as much acetylene as benzene anyway.

Here&#039;s my (probably imperfect) understanding of the interstellar/planetary carbon story.  Interstellar carbon is mostly CO and unidentified compounds widely assumed to be PAHs.  These are formed mainly in the hydrogen-rich atmospheres of red giants.  I&#039;ve always sort of assumed this process is not entirely unlike the formation of smoke in oxygen-poor hydrocarbon combustion.  CO and PAHs are apparently more stable than CH4 and simple hydrocarbons in the interstellar environment.  CO in particular has the highest binding energy of any chemical bond.

When a planetary system forms, the nebula condenses and heats up.  CO + excess H2 goes to H2O and CH4 and CO2.  Except in the colder outer regions - transneptunian objects end up being rockier than giant planet moons because less oxygen goes to make H2O.  I have no idea what happens to the PAHs at this stage but I get the impression thay&#039;re not expected to survive in the planetary region.

Tholins form only on planetary surfaces or atmospheres.  Hydrogen atoms are split off CH4 or NH3 by energetic particles or solar UV, and the hydrogen atom thermally escapes the gravitational field.  The remaining free radical, too slow to escape, reacts with other radicals to form big branched structures with lots of C-C and C-N triple bonds, i.e. tholins.

So if they both basically form by loss of hydrogen, why the chemical difference?  I&#039;m not a chemist, but I think the temperature has something to do with it.  I picture PAHs as being formed in a hydrogen-rich environment where C-H bonds are disfavored by high temperatures relative to C-C.  Maybe there&#039;s a sort of chemical annealing at work allowing them to &quot;find&quot; those regular low-energy hexagonal structures.  Whereas tholins form at low temperatures from highly reactive constituents, so they just stick together the first way they meet, forming highly irregular structures.

Any chemists around who know anything about this?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Over on Google+ we wondered whether methane could serve as a medium for life (say on Titan), and Jeremy Buchanan wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Isaac Asimov had an interesting essay on the subject, in which he does consider methane as a replacement for water. His idea is that it could maybe work if the complex molecules of biology were lipids instead of proteins and nucleic acids.

Other potential chemistries he considers are:

1. fluorosilicone in fluorosilicone
2. fluorocarbon in sulfur
3.  nucleic acid/protein (O) in water
4. nucleic acid/protein (N) in ammonia
5. lipid in methane
6. lipid in hydrogen

I would love to hear more recent well-informed thoughts about these options.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[More on the name Dysnomia, from &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysnomia_%28moon%29#Name&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Mike Brown, the moon&#039;s discoverer, chose the name Dysnomia (Greek: Δυσνομία) due to a number of resonances it possessed for him. Dysnomia, the daughter of Eris, fits the general historically established pattern of naming moons after lesser gods associated with the primary (hence, Jupiter&#039;s largest moons are named after lovers of Jupiter, while Saturn&#039;s are named after his fellow Titans). Also, the English translation of &quot;Dysnomia&quot;, &quot;lawlessness&quot;, echoes Lucy Lawless, the actress famous for starring in Xena: Warrior Princess on television. Before receiving their official names, Eris and Dysnomia were known informally as &quot;Xena&quot; and &quot;Gabrielle&quot;, and Brown decided to retain that connection.

Brown also notes that Pluto owes its name in part to its first two letters, which form the initials of Percival Lowell, the founder of the observatory where its discoverer, Clyde Tombaugh, was working, and the person who inspired the search for &quot;Planet X&quot;. James Christy, who discovered Charon, followed the principle established with Pluto by choosing a name which shared its first four letters with his wife&#039;s name, Charlene. &quot;Dysnomia&quot;, similarly, has the same first letter as Brown&#039;s wife, Diane, and Brown uses the nickname &quot;Dy&quot; /ˈdaɪ/ for the moon, which he pronounces the same as his wife&#039;s nickname, Di. Because of this, Brown pronounces the full name /daɪsˈnoʊmiə/, with a long &quot;y&quot;.

In addition, both Eris and Dysnomia, representing aspects of chaos, reflect the effect their existence had in the disputation on the definition of a planet (and specifically on the status of Pluto and Ceres), and the debate that followed.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>
