I understand &quot;projection&quot; is a technical term in climate science, but I was not aware of the existence of an explicit definition.

In fact there is one in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grida.no/publications/other/ipcc_tar/?src=/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/518.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Glossary of IPCC TAR WG1&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;i&gt;&quot;&lt;b&gt;Climate projection&lt;/b&gt;
A projection of the response of the climate system to emission or concentration scenarios of greenhouse gases and aerosols, or radiative forcing scenarios, often based upon simulations by climate models. Climate projections are distinguished from climate predictions in order to emphasise that climate projections depend upon the emission/concentration/ radiative forcing scenario used, which are based on assumptions, concerning, e.g., future socio-economic and technological developments, that may or may not be realised, and are therefore subject to substantial uncertainty&quot;.&lt;/i&gt;

There is a specific problem with it. We are actually not interested so much in confirming or falsifying projections based on old scenarios, but in the validity of the underlying computational climate model. However, source code is not archived, documented and published, therefore it is impossible to re-run code after two decades with actual data collected since then. It means we are not in a position to say anything meaningful about the &lt;b&gt;1990 IPCC Climate Projections&lt;/b&gt;, which entails a game played outside the realm of science.]]></description>

There are two issues: what the terms denote, and how you assess the accuracy/utility of a set of projections. I&#039;m not remotely expert enough to talk about how the assessment should be done for climate projections (or whether how it&#039;s currently being done is adequate); I was just pointing out that these terms when used by climatologists have the meanings that climatologists, rather than colloquial usage, define them to have, in the same way that the term &quot;function&quot; means different things to mathermaticians, to computer programmers and people in general.]]></description>

So, you effectively say a projection (in this sense of the word) is nothing else but a conditional prediction, don&#039;t you? If so, why don&#039;t we use simply the term &quot;prediction&quot;, even more so because essentially all scientific predictions are conditional?

Or do you mean a projection is prediction over a set of several &quot;scenarios&quot;, but not over &lt;i&gt;all reasonable scenarios&lt;/i&gt;, because we lack the knowledge to make such generalizations? In this case a projection, unlike proper scientific prediction, is virtually &lt;i&gt;unfalsifiable&lt;/i&gt;, except in the rare cases one of the scenarios considered at the time of projection actually happen to unfold later on.]]></description>

a &lt;em&gt;prediction&lt;/em&gt; is a model based &quot;forecast&quot; of the future &lt;em&gt;when you know all the relevant input data at the time the prediction is made&lt;/em&gt;.

the need to use &lt;em&gt;projections&lt;/em&gt; occurs when you believe you&#039;ve got a model but some of the input data is only available &lt;em&gt;after the time you&#039;ve made the prediction&lt;/em&gt;. The current practice is to make a set of hypotheses about the future data (eg, human carbon emissions each future year) and then a &lt;em&gt;prediciton&lt;/em&gt; for each of these cases.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The main trouble is with the very concept of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thefreedictionary.com/projection&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;projection&lt;/a&gt;. It is a murky one with 8 or 9 separate dictionary entries of which only one (&quot;a prediction or an estimate of something in the future, based on present data or trends&quot; or &quot;a prediction based on known evidence and observations&quot;) matches more or less the thing we traditionally used to do in science.

And these definitions do refer back to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thefreedictionary.com/prediction&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;prediction&lt;/a&gt;, a much sharper concept. It is derived from the verb &lt;a href=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;predict&lt;/a&gt;, which has both transitive and intransitive usage, the latter one involving &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thefreedictionary.com/prophesy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;prophesy&lt;/a&gt;, which is clearly outside the domain of science.

Therefore we are left with &quot;to state, tell about, or make known in advance, especially on the basis of special knowledge&quot;, which is close enough.

But in this case there is no legitimate reason whatsoever to invent a term other than &lt;b&gt;prediction&lt;/b&gt;, is there?

We have specific protocols and procedures in place to compare scientific predictions against results of future observations and/or measurements, which either match the prediction or not, thus either strengthening or falsifying the piece of &lt;i&gt;special knowledge&lt;/i&gt; the prediction was based on.

On the other hand, with &lt;b&gt;projections&lt;/b&gt; we lack all these tools, so we are left in utter darkness.]]></description>

Hmm, I forgot you couldn’t do block quotes here.

Hmm, I just had some trouble doing it myself.  But lots of people have done it successfully for years here, and it&#039;s working for me now, so I&#039;m not sure what&#039;s up.   

I tried to fix that comment of yours.  Thanks for all you comments on this thread!]]></description>

In reply to Frederik, yes I was simply referring to the time series plotted relative to its own average.

What I was making was a rather trite point about there being two &quot;regimes&quot;, which sounds quite impressive, until you realise that when relating a time series to it&#039;s own average, rather than some independently determined value, any time series with an monotonic trend will look like it&#039;s got two &quot;regimes&quot;. In this case the fact that temporal range lies &quot;below zero&quot; and the other lies &quot;above zero&quot; means less than if the zero point has some independent physical meaning. (As a related point, the in the UK we sometimes make fun of politicians who loudly proclaim their plans will ensure that &quot;in future our reforms will raise up every student so they&#039;re all above average&quot;.)

As Nathan points out there are sophisticated ways of attempting to discern change-points, but they&#039;re doing things that generally involve making stronger assumptions and require greater work.]]></description>

There are statistical methods for &quot;changepoint&quot; or &quot;breakpoint&quot; problems (usually assuming that the underlying trend is discontinuous piecewise constant or discontinuous piecewise linear, although some assume continuity).  I haven&#039;t been too impressed by their performance on real time series, mostly because changepoints are confounded with the presumed error model.  (Is that a &quot;real&quot; jump, or is it an autocorrelated noise fluctuation?)  For climate time series, it would probably also be necessary to use a less naive trend model.  Finally, a &quot;regime change&quot; in climate science is something physical (a reorganization of atmospheric-ocean circulation) and you&#039;d want to look at more than a global average surface temperature, instead of a purely statistical time series approach.]]></description>
