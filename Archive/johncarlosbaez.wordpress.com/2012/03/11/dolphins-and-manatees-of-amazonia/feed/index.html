					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/03/11/dolphins-and-manatees-of-amazonia/#comment-14290&quot;&gt;Jeremy&lt;/a&gt;.

That&#039;s neat!  Manatees have been spotted as far north as Rhode Island and Connecticut.

&lt;a href=&quot;http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/2007/06/multiple_new_species_of_large_1.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt; on the same blog is also intereresting.  It discusses some newly discovered types of dolphins and manatees in Amazonia:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Amazonia is home not only to large terrestrial mammals, but to amphibious and aquatic ones too. Most of us are familiar with the fact that freshwater dolphins swim through the flooded forests, and there is also an Amazonian manatee &lt;i&gt;Trichechus inunguis&lt;/i&gt;, and the Giant otter &lt;i&gt;Pteronura brasiliensis&lt;/i&gt;, the world&#039;s longest (though not heaviest) otter. Marc has three new amphibious/aquatic mammals that might represent new species - a new river dolphin, a dwarf manatee, and a new giant otter. The new river dolphin [shown in adjacent photo] is unique to the Rio Aripuanã and almost certainly belongs to the genus Inia. The question, however, is whether it is conspecific with &lt;i&gt;I. geoffrensis&lt;/i&gt;, the better known of the two Boto species*. While both types of dolphin have been seen in the same area, they stay apart, and the Rio Aripuanã form is reported to be more aggressive to people and to differ from the Boto in its timing and style of exhalation. It also looks different from the Boto in being smaller, and in having a less bulbous forehead and shorter jaws. It is never pink like the Boto.

* The taxonomy of the boto has always been mildly controversial, with various people arguing at times that &lt;i&gt;Inia&lt;/i&gt; includes two species (I. geoffrensis and I. boliviensis), while others argue that the two are conspecific. Several recent molecular studies (Banguera-Hinestroza et al. 2002, Martínez-Aguero et al 2006), and an unpublished PhD thesis on cranial morphometrics, have concluded that &lt;i&gt;I. geoffrensis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;I. boliviensis&lt;/i&gt; should be recognised as distinct species.

Quite a few new cetacean species have been named within recent years, so Marc&#039;s discovery of a new dwarf manatee, known to locals as the peixe-boi anão, is arguably more significant. Amazonia is already home to one recognised manatee, &lt;i&gt;Trichechus inunguis&lt;/i&gt;: the dwarf species differs from it in reaching just 1.3 m and 60 kg (compared to 2.5-3 m and 350-500 kg) and in being deep black (instead of lead grey) [adjacent image shows adult male dwarf manatee. Yes, adult male. It&#039;s 1.3 m long]. The two are presumably close relatives (they certainly look more similar to each other than to either of the other two extant manatee species), and this has been confirmed by genetic analysis. A short technical paper on the manatee was submitted to a high-profile science journal, and news on its discovery has been discussed in the popular press. Like the dolphin, the dwarf manatee is restricted in distribution and has only been reported from one tributary of the Rio Aripuanã. 

Finally, the new otter - informally dubbed the Black giant otter - is both morphologically and behaviourally distinct from &lt;i&gt;P. brasiliensis&lt;/i&gt;. It is not only darker than this species, but also somewhat smaller. All three of these mammals appear to represent dwarf endemic forms of larger, more widespread species.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

I&#039;ve heard rumors they might still exist... but yes, a shame!  From the Wikipedia article you linked to:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the 1950s, the population was estimated at 6,000 animals, but declined rapidly over the subsequent five decades. Only a few hundred were left by 1970. Then the number dropped down to 400 by the 1980s and then to 13 in 1997 when a full-fledged search was conducted. Now the most endangered cetacean in the world, according to the Guinness Book of World Records, the Baiji was last sighted in August 2004, though there was a possible sighting in 2007.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Look at my comment up above for a map of river dolphins.]]></description>

Hmm, it seems the Orinoco River dolphin is a separate subspecies, and there&#039;s another one separated from the main one by waterfalls:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/268/1466/549.full.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/amazon_and_other_river_dolphins.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

I&#039;m just reading a novel about someone who studies the Ganges dolphin!  All this is from:

&#8226;  Healy Hamilton, Susana Caballero, Allen G. Collins and Robert L. Brownell, Jr, &lt;a href=&quot;http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/268/1466/549.full.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Evolution of river dolphins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Proc. Roy. Soc. Lond. B&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;268&lt;/b&gt; (2001), 549--556.
