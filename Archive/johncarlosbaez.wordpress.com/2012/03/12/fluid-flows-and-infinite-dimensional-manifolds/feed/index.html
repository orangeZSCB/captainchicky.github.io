I don&#039;t know where you&#039;re getting that $latex i$ in your $latex e^{ix}$.  There are no complex numbers in Tim&#039;s post or in the Burgers equation.  Physicists doing quantum mechanics like to insert $latex i$ in the definition of Lie algebras, so that group elements look like $latex e^{ix}$ where $latex x$ is a Lie algebra element.  But mathematicians know this is unnecessary, and in contexts like the Burgers equation this it would be very confusing.  If $latex x$ is a vector field on a compact manifold, we can exponentiate it and get a diffeomorphism $latex e^{x}.$]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A few more observations:

It seems clear that there will be a Hamiltonian structure associated with the geodesics of the manifold, since these flow lines are inherently minimizing a quantity. 

From these will we be able to deduce relevant conservation laws of the fluid? Also, I would expect the Hamiltonian structure to yield additional information about the dynamic equations of the geodesics, but precisely what I&#039;m unsure of. 

Since speculation gets us nowhere, I&#039;ll start to scour the internet for relevant resources.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/03/12/fluid-flows-and-infinite-dimensional-manifolds/#comment-14362&quot;&gt;Tim van Beek&lt;/a&gt;.

Stochasticity contributes to the wave energy spectrum of typical open-ocean waves. 

First, we make a maximum entropy estimation of the energy of a one-dimensional propagating wave driven by a prevailing wind direction. The mean energy of the wave is related to the wave height by the square of the height, H. This makes sense because a taller wave needs a broader base to support that height, leading to a scaled pseudo-triangular shape, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-E3tDvyDrhV4/TxXL9PW6ZYI/AAAAAAAAAzk/0nr95rnuEIo/s320/scaled_wave_shape.GIF&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;shown in this figure&lt;/a&gt;.  

Since the area of such a scaled triangle goes as H^2, the MaxEnt cumulative probability is:

$latex    P(H) = e^{-a H^2} $

where &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; is related to the mean energy of an ensemble of waves. This relationship is empirically observed from measurements of ocean wave heights over a sufficient  time period. However, we can proceed further and try to derive the dispersion results of wave frequency, which is the very common oceanography measure. So we consider -- based on the energy stored in a specific wave -- the time, &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;, it will take to drop a height, H, by the Newton&#039;s law relation:

$latex    t^2 \sim H $

and since &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; goes as 1/&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;, then we can create a new PDF from the height cumulative as follows:

$latex p(f) df = \frac{dP(H)}{dH} \frac{dH}{df} df $

where

$latex  H \sim \frac{1}{f^2} $

$latex   \frac{dH}{df} \sim -\frac{1}{f^3} $

then

$latex   p(f) \sim \frac{1}{f^5} e^{-\frac{c}{f^4}} $

which is just the Pierson-Moskowitz wave spectra that oceanographers have observed for years (developed first in 1964, variations of this include the Bretschneider and ITTC wave spectra).

One can actually test this by visiting one of the real-time buoy measuring stations, this one off of San Diego.

This is an interesting derivation that I have not seen anywhere before and it is one of those cases that first-order physics (Newton&#039;s Law plus MaxEnt)  works pretty effectively to describe real-world behavior for a seemingly complex phenomena.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Interesting discussions.  I&#039;d just like to make three points:
1) It&#039;s sort of obvious but I only just noticed that if you integrate u around the circle then you get a conserved quantity (w.r.t. time).  Both the physical and geodesic interpretations are quite natural.

2) If you make sure that the above integral is zero then a step function describes a periodic geodesic (just integrate by hand starting at the identity, or constant map).  Having said that I haven&#039;t done this rigorously, I could be mistaken.

2) One could try to do the differential geometry of a function which takes multiple values (multiple &#039;particles&#039; with differing velocities) by replacing $latex Diff(S^1)$ with a category of spans.  When composing one has to be careful taking the pullbacks (I think it&#039;s possible to keep our pullbacks being closed 1-manifolds if not a single circle).  The Lie algebra looks like the tensor product of two copies of the Lie algebra above, however there is an issue with the invariant metric, because it isn&#039;t both left and right invariant I think you have to change the Lie algebra slightly.  You also need to change the metric a little and make sure that everything you do is invariant with respect to a diagonal copy of $latex Diff(S^1)$ which corresponds to equivalence of spans, or reparametrisation of our curve.

Having said all this I&#039;m not convinced that what you get behaves nicely.  I&#039;ve so far failed to fill in all the details.]]></description>
