Yes, very nice.  This discussion keeps on rolling, over 5 years after it started!]]></description>

I can add to the list of books Vasilyev and Gutenmacher  &quot;Lines and Curves: A Practical Geometry Handbook&quot;, Birkhauser; 1 edition (July 23, 2004) and C. Zwikker&#039;s &quot;The Advanced Geometry of Plane Curves and Their Applications&quot;, Dover, 2005. At my site http://www.cut-the-knot.org there are several interactive Java gadgets that explore exactly those properties of cardioids that you mentioned.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Order and chaos are two sides of the same coin. Indeed, the words &quot;cosmos&quot; and &quot;chaos&quot; share the same greek origin and mean curiously such a different &quot;notions&quot;, likely complementary &quot;a la Böhr&quot;, since order is regularity and chaos is mainly associated to nonlinear and &quot;wild&quot; phenomena. In fact, you should know I have always preferred my own variation of those words &quot;Chaosmos&quot; (Chaotic Cosmos, as portmanteau) to call the main features of this Universe (or Multiverse/Polyverse if you believe there are other bubble Universes beyond the Lemaitre limit, aka the observable radius of our known Universe).]]></description>

One way that helps me to picture it is to first imagine the moving circle moving around the stationary one but with the same point of the moving circle touching the stationary one. In this case, it is apparent that the moving circle will have rotated only once.

Second, picture the moving circle rotating while its centre remains fixed.
 
Lastly, the actual example is a combination of these two motions, as the moving circle rolls without slipping around the stationary circle. The combination of the two types of rotation produces two rotations in all.]]></description>

It&#039;s a strange sort of optical illusion (perhaps well known by magicians?). I too found it impossible to mentally see from the animation. Even with mathematica demonstrations &quot;frame by frame&quot; I could not see it.  I was about to use 2 table coasters to help me out when I remembered that in V. Hart&#039;s video she used paper with lines. Only by looking closely at her video I got it. 

Really readily understandable, fun and fascinating this entire series. From geometry to the center of the universe astronomy to engine design and also with some nice user contributed proofs and facts, its a &quot;little fractal&quot; of science - I think this would be quite a good talk to high-school students.]]></description>

The point on the rolling circle that&#039;s initially at (1,0) on the rolling circle faces right &lt;i&gt;twice&lt;/i&gt; as that circle rolls &lt;i&gt;once&lt;/i&gt; around big one. If the rolling circle were the Earth and the center of the big  circle were the Sun, you&#039;d see the stars go around the sky twice each year.  So, we can say the rolling circle &lt;i&gt;rotates&lt;/i&gt; twice as it &lt;i&gt;revolves&lt;/i&gt; once.

(Of course, the Sun would be actually touching the Earth, but never mind!)

You can probably get what I&#039;m asking in Puzzle 1 and Puzzle 2 now.  It&#039;s also good to figure out how many times you see the stars go around the sky during a single year.]]></description>
