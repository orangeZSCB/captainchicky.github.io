&lt;blockquote&gt; Is a ‘Presburger set’ a subset of $latex \mathbb{N}^k$ that can be described by a formula in Presburger arithmetic?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Exactly, and indeed Jérôme Leroux&#039; algorithm is extremely nice and simple.  He recently gave a new proof of its correctness---which does not rely on the (now) classical decompositions by Mayr, Kosaraju, and Lambert---in

Jérôme Leroux, Vector addition system reachability problem: a short self-contained proof, &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1926385.1926421&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;POPL 2011&lt;/a&gt;, ACM Press.

Wow!  Thanks for telling us the latest twist in the story!  I&#039;ll correct my blog article.

I have mystical reasons for wanting the reachability problem to only be solvable by an algorithm that&#039;s not primitive recursive.  Not very good reasons.  I&#039;ve gotten interested in the idea of problems that are decidable but only very slowly, or models of computation that fail to be Turing-complete but are still very powerful---I&#039;d like to see results that probe the &#039;borderline of computability&#039;.   I also like symmetric monoidal categories.  So, I&#039;m hoping they give natural examples of such results.]]></description>

Thanks for helping me understand this!  Is a &#039;Presburger set&#039; a subset of $latex \mathbb{N}^k$ that can be described by a formula in Presburger arithmetic?  It sounds like that&#039;s what you&#039;re saying.

This is very nice.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I always find it exciting to find someone interested in the intersection between computers and chemistry.  You and your readers may find the following related work useful.  

There&#039;s quite a lot of related work, of course, since the field goes back over 40 years, to E.J. Corey&#039;s 1969 Science publication &quot;Computer-Assisted Design of Complex Organic Syntheses&quot;, available at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencemag.org/content/166/3902/178.full.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.sciencemag.org/content/166/3902/178.full.pdf&lt;/a&gt;

Although, perhaps, a review article or two would contextualize the work better.  Cook et al.&#039;s &quot;Computer-aided synthesis design: 40 years on&quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wcms.61/full&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wcms.61/full&lt;/a&gt;) and Todd&#039;s &quot;Computer-aided organic synthesis&quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2005/cs/b104620a&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2005/cs/b104620a&lt;/a&gt;) may help.

Also, if you&#039;re interested in other modern formulations of chemistry by computer scientists for computer scientists, you might check out Masoumi and Soutchanski&#039;s &quot;Reasoning about Chemical Reactions using the Situation Calculus (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.ryerson.ca/~mes/publications/MasoumiSoutchanski_2012FallAAAI-DiscoveryInformaticsSymposium_Nov2-4.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.cs.ryerson.ca/~mes/publications/MasoumiSoutchanski_2012FallAAAI-DiscoveryInformaticsSymposium_Nov2-4.pdf&lt;/a&gt;) or my  &quot;Construction of New Medicines via Game Proof Search&quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/view/4936&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/view/4936&lt;/a&gt;).

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;What about the connection to Presburger arithmetic? This title suggests that it exists: [...]&quot;

Reachability sets in Petri nets go beyond what is expressible in Presburger arithmetic (Hopcroft and Pansiot, 1979, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3975(79)90041-0).  What Jérôme Leroux has shown is that, however, a proof of &lt;i&gt;non-reachability&lt;/i&gt; can be expressed through a &lt;i&gt;Presburger invariant&lt;/i&gt;, i.e. two disjoint Presburger sets: one containing the source configuration and all its reachable configurations, the other containing the target configuration and all the configurations that reach it.  This yields a semi-algorithm for non-reachability: enumerate pairs of Presburger formulae, until you find a Presburger invariant; as there is a trivial smi-algorithm for reachability (enumerate paths until you find one from source to target), this means that the problem as a whole is decidable.  Not a very constructive algorithm :)]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;Is there a series of reactions that gets from the first multiset to a &lt;i&gt;super-multiset&lt;/i&gt; of the second one? For all I know there is a more efficient algorithm that solves this modified problem.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is known as the &lt;b&gt;coverability&lt;/b&gt; problem.  Unlike the reachability problem, its complexity is well understood, as the ExpSpace lower bound of Lipton is matched by an ExpSpace upper bound due to Rackoff:

&#8226; Charles Rackoff, The covering and boundedness problems for vector addition systems, &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3975(78)90036-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Theoretical Computer Science&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt; (1978), 223–231.

					<description><![CDATA[I should point out that Bouziane&#039;s proof of an elementary upper bound for the reachability problem has been shown incorrect by Jančar:

&#8226; Petr Jančar, Bouziane’s transformation of the Petri net reachability problem and incorrectness of the related algorithm, &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ic.2008.06.003&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Information and Computation&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;b&gt;206&lt;/b&gt; (2008), 1259--1263.

At the moment there are &lt;i&gt;no&lt;/i&gt; known upper complexity bounds for the problem (besides being decidable), not even Ackermannian ones (contrarily to what is stated in the post, or I would be happy to read a reference!).]]></description>

It is only an idea: it is possible that a Petri net can represent the rna functions of a virus; so that there is a bijection between virus in an environment and a Petri net.
An other simple idea: the human dna can have a Petri net representation, so that can be possible to represent the protein production in a mathematical form, to simplify the biological representation of the dna function.
