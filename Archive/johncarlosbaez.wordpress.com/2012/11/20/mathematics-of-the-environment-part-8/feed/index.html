					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/11/20/mathematics-of-the-environment-part-8/#comment-22205&quot;&gt;Graham&lt;/a&gt;.

I only stumbled on this question four years later, but since it reflects some misconceptions about the relationships between the quantities involved ...

&lt;blockquote&gt;You can have constant energy E or constant T but not both (as fas as I can see)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

... I thought it was worth trying to set the record straight on the same page.

If you fix the masses of two bodies orbiting under their mutual gravitational attraction, then the total energy (kinetic plus potential) $latex E$, the semi-major axis of their orbit, $latex a$, and the period of their orbit, $latex T$, are all determined by specifying just one of these three quantities.  For example, in terms of $latex a$, we have:

$latex \displaystyle{E = -\frac{G M \mu}{2 a}}$
$latex \displaystyle{T = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{a^3}{G M}}}$

where $latex M$ and $latex \mu$ are the total mass and reduced mass of the two bodies, and for something like the Earth-Sun system are very close to being just the mass of the Sun and the mass of the Earth.

Contrary to the assumptions in the question, you can change the angular momentum of the system while holding the energy, semi-major axis and period of the orbit constant.  We have:

$latex \displaystyle{ J = \mu  \sqrt{G M a \left(1-e^2\right)}}$

where $latex e$ is the eccentricity.

So changes in angular momentum in an orbit of fixed energy (and hence fixed period and fixed semi-major axis) just correspond to changes in eccentricity.  The period &lt;i&gt;doesn&#039;t&lt;/i&gt; need to change in order for the angular momentum to change; rather, the change in angular momentum arises from the change in the &lt;i&gt;shape&lt;/i&gt; of the orbit.]]></description>

arch 1,

Wow, you and I wear different glasses. I see how precession is related to eccentricity, but two interglacials near 400 and 800kya occur at low eccentricity and low precession amplitude. It is interesting that Dr. Berger claims the &quot;beat&quot; of precession modulates eccentricity. Seems more likely the other way around. Precession isn&#039;t beating on anything. The earth just passively sits at whatever angle dictated by obliquity and has inevitable phase relative to eccentricity such that different seasons pertain to aphelion.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Fascinating post, deserves much more time than I&#039;ve given it so far.  I do find one sentence puzzling:

&quot;Indeed, if you only look at this graph, you might easily decide that Milankovitch cycles are not important in causing glacial cycles.&quot;

My eyeballs tell me something very different.  When I scan the precession curve I see exactly eleven regions of relatively high amplitude, at roughly 100kyr intervals.  Coincident with each of these eleven regions (and nowhere else) I see a significant peak of the black temperature curve.  (OK, two of the temperature peaks are double peaks, and the high-precession-amplitude regions at 400kyr and 800kry are decidedly wimpy, but they are also decidedly there, and despite these anomalies the overall pattern described fairly screams out at me).

Maybe my ancestors were the ones always issuing false-positive predator calls in the jungle (if so, belated apologies:-)]]></description>

The Wikipedia article says that the semi-major axis is an &#039;adiabatic invariant&#039;.  This suggests that it remains unchanged, not just by certain special perturbations, but all perturbations.  It might be easier to prove this than to solve any particular 3-body problem!

The theme of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiabatic_invariant&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;adiabatic invariants&lt;/a&gt; is important in physics, and as you&#039;ll see if you click that link, the area in phase space enclosed by an orbit is an adiabatic invariant that played a big role in the early history of quantum mechanics.  So, I&#039;m hoping that for elliptical orbits in a 1/r2 force law the semi-major axis is a function of this quantity.

Okay... so I have my work cut out for me, though probably I&#039;ll take the lazy route and grab a book on perturbation theory in celestial mechanics.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What about effects of Earth&#039;s geothermal energy on climate?

Perhaps those orbital cycles affect patterns of magma convection in the mantle through tidal effects as they alter which latitudes are closest to the Moon (if my understanding of them is correct). This could alter heat transfer to the surface and affect global climate.]]></description>
