The meat of the argument seems to be a variation on the observation that to establish the presence of a species in a patch of territory you only need to explore the patch until the first specimen while to establish its absence you need to explore the whole patch. As presented at BBC or in the abstract I don&#039;t find it convincingly relevant, but the details of the Nature paper are available for 30$.

&lt;i&gt;Species–area relationships always overestimate extinction rates from habitat loss&lt;/i&gt;

I fixed the link to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/cogs502/GoodTuring1953.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;I. J. Good&#039;s paper&lt;/a&gt;.  Firefox has stopped including the &quot;http://&quot; in its display of URLs.  This is why two links in this blog entry didn&#039;t work.  But it&#039;s weird, because until very recently, Firefox included the &quot;http://&quot; when I cut-and-pasted URLs from that display, despite not showing the &quot;http://&quot;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
My guess (intuition and ignorance mixed together) is that the estimator is asymptotically unbiased and an n=3 is to small a sample for its bias to get small.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That sounds right.  Theorem 1 in &lt;a href=&quot;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.41.7209&#038;rep=rep1&#038;type=pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the paper by Macallister and Schapire&lt;/a&gt; seems to say this estimator is asymptotically unbiased.  (My main uncertainty here is that I&#039;m just guessing the official definition of &#039;asymptotically unbiased 
estimator&#039;.  The theorem certainly gives a sense in which the estimator gets less biased as the sample size increases.)

By the way, after having gone to different restaurants for 4 days, I skipped lunch on the 5th, but the rest of the gang went to yet another new restaurant.]]></description>

I find something a bit unclear about your counting procedure. It would seem from the line ending in (2), that you treat repeated counts in such a way that the estimate becomes quite sensitive to a circumstance that shouldn&#039;t impact IMO - that of two large counts happening to be equal. Also, it would help if you&#039;d named number of species and number of specimens in a more distinctive way. My first perception is that the greater simplicity of my version of &quot;reversing&quot; makes it easier to bring assumptions into focus.]]></description>

To understand the future, you need to think about the past, sure, but I meant something more like using imagination to reverse the gears of learning (twice in a row over a short sequence, if need be).

Meanwhile, I see 20/20 hindsight &lt;a&gt;- a phenomenon acknowledged enough to get a nickname -&lt;/a&gt; as proof that people don&#039;t generally understand the contemplation of the past to involve similar gear-reversals.]]></description>

Actually there topic of &quot;reversibility arguments&quot; brings up something I&#039;ve been meaning to mention. A month or so ago the BBC radio series &quot;More or less&quot; had a piece interviewing some scientist (name forgotten) who was claiming most biodiversity loss estimates were inaccurate overestimates of loss. Apparently, if I understand it correctly, there&#039;s two steps typically used:

1. Select a series of nested pieces of land (of some type) increasing size and &quot;count&quot; the number of species in each. (The estimation in the count doesn&#039;t really matter.) From this construct a curve of how the number of species varies with area.

2. Take an existing area with a &quot;counted&quot; number of species and a projected area reduction and use the curve to produce an estimate of the new number of species.

The argument was that an implied reversibility symmetry isn&#039;t there: species are more &quot;robust to loss in the presence of declining area&quot; than they are &quot;prone to speciation in the presence of increasing area&quot;, so simple reversing doesn&#039;t work. The scientist wasn&#039;t claiming that biodiversity loss wasn&#039;t happening, just that many numerical predictions were dramatic overestimates.

(Alert readers will have spotted that this isn&#039;t an exact reversal; ideally step 1 would actively expand the area and watch speciation happen rather than just be a &quot;measurement artifact&quot;. The radio piece, which I was half listening to while stripping wallpaper, did stress that a non-applicable reversibility was being assumed in standard models.)]]></description>
