Even if they are successfully challenged, the problem remains and another bad actor will simply take their place. As it becomes ever more possible to cheaply generate and store information, copyright monopolies become the chief impediment to the distribution of information. The ultimate solution is to simply outlaw copyrights and things meant to effectively replace them. Arguments that somehow this means creators won&#039;t be paid have no merit. Scientific publishing is something of a &#039;canary in a coal mine&#039; in that it shows the welfare of creators is largely irrelevant to the discussion. Until copyrights and patents are eliminated, the ability to use the world&#039;s information will be ever more difficult to obtain at the same time that its cost of creation vanishes to zero.]]></description>

Today I checked that pirate project, they were fundraising for a hosting and proxies unreachable for those &quot;evil capitalists&quot; (yep, that&#039;s the style they used to shape the plead :D ). But the interesting part is that comrades claim there are around 50 million of paywalled articles of which they have already downloaded and stored 22 million. The project operates since 2011 and I think there are good chances in a few coming years to fill that 30 million gap. Or how they call it &quot;liberate articles from capitalist oppression&quot; :-) Provided, of course, the fundraising succeeds.]]></description>

That&#039;s an impressive, encouraging graph, compilation of a single years&#039; worth of data!

Not only are you welcome to post my comment on Google+, I&#039;d be very appreciative if you did. Though I&#039;d prefer that you not reveal my name, which I used in a moment of enhanced fury over Elsevier&#039;s actions. While there&#039;s nothing I&#039;d like more than to be associated with a broad movement, given Elsevier&#039;s reach, associating my name with an isolated, personal intent to sue the company may not be a good idea.

I looked for a means to establish contact with you, here, but didn&#039;t find one.    ]]></description>

I wish you luck!

Would it be okay if I repost your remarks on Google+, together with your name and perhaps some way to contact you?  I have lots of readers there; one of them might help you.  Here&#039;s something I posted about Elsevier yesterday &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.google.com/u/0/117663015413546257905/posts/BT78EwPkU4R&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;over there&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-jwnOSnhXVkU/UqJ1phOMSPI/AAAAAAAAmRs/wGdCablKqY4/w506-h410/signatories.png&quot; /&gt; 

The number of people boycotting Elsevier keeps going up!  Here&#039;s the graph for 2013.  See the sudden increase at the end?  That&#039;s because Elsevier forced the paper-sharing website Academia.edu to take down some papers. 

In retaliation, Academia.edu sent out emails like this:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Unfortunately, we had to remove your paper [...] due to a take-down notice from Elsevier.

Academia.edu is committed to enabling the transition to a world where there is open access to academic literature. Elsevier takes a different view, and is currently upping the ante in its opposition to academics sharing their own papers online.

Over the last year, more than 13,000 professors have signed a petition voicing displeasure at Elsevier’s business practices at www.thecostofknowledge.com. If you have any comments or thoughts, we would be glad to hear them.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Join in!  If you haven&#039;t signed the petition yet, now is a good time!

And here&#039;s a question: what made so many people sign the petition in May?  The bottom of this graph is not zero, it&#039;s 12,500 people, so the rise is not as impressive at it looks - but still, something happened in May.﻿

					<description><![CDATA[A friend who is familiar with my problems with Reed Elsevier recommended this blog and blogpost to me, where I discover confirmation of broader implications of Elsevier’s abusive practices.

Arriving a bit late to the discussion, here, I’d like to point out, nevertheless, that Elsevier’s policies affect not only scientists, universities, authors, and an interested public, but tens of thousands of sub-contractors as well.

I work as a graphic designer / illustrator in science and medicine, in Paris, France, where Reed Elsevier muscled its way in to establish a virtual monopoly on scientific and medical publishing by roughly 2005, having bought up every last, specialized French publishing company: Vigot, Masson, EMC [Encyclopédie Médico-Chirurgicale], including various subsidiaries. Why the French government would have allowed such a takeover is an open question …

Working for the EMC for 18 years before the company was purchased by Elsevier, I traveled all over France to meet with authors of submitted papers, to discuss and outline the best approach to depiction of their studies. That important collaboration, and much else, ended with the arrival of Elsevier.

Remuneration for sub-contracted art work was cut in half, cession of copyright to Elsevier, for all time and all publication formats, was imposed. Illustration became factory work, handed out to young, inexperienced illustrators, the consequence of which has been the loss of important information and communication.

I intend to take Elsevier to court for its blatant violation of copyright law and contracts, but since Elsevier deliberately blocks contact between its sub-contracted illustrators and designers, I’ll be on my own.

If anyone has knowledge of organized actions against Elsevier on the part of sub-contractors, please post any information you may have.

Aaron Swartz, Coder and Activist, Dead at 26
Kevin Poulsen 
13 Jan 2013

&#062; We often say, upon the passing of a friend or loved one, that the world is a poorer place for the loss. But with the untimely death of programmer and activist Aaron Swartz, this isn’t just a sentiment; it’s literally true. Worthy, important causes will surface without a champion equal to their measure. Technological problems will go unsolved, or be solved a little less brilliantly than they might have been. And that’s just what we know. The world is robbed of a half-century of all the things we can’t even imagine Aaron would have accomplished with the remainder of his life.

The web responds to the death of hacker-activist Aaron Swartz
Mathew Ingram
12 Jan 2013

&#062; The open web and freedom of information in general lost one of their most passionate proponents yesterday, with the death of early Reddit staffer and Demand Progress founder Aaron Swartz, who committed suicide on Friday, according to a family member. He was facing federal charges for hacking into the JSTOR academic database and downloading millions of research papers, but had also reportedly suffered from depression. He was 26 years old.

Internet pioneer and information activist takes his own life
Timothy B. Lee 
12 Jan 2013

&#062; Unfortunately, Aaron&#039;s penchant for defying social convention may have been his undoing. He was arrested in 2011 for scraping articles from the academic archive JSTOR. Facing hacking charges that could put him in prison for decades, Aaron took his own life on Friday.

The inspiring heroism of Aaron Swartz
Glenn Greenwald
12 Jan 2013

&#062;  he committed himself to the causes in which he so passionately believed: internet freedom, civil liberties, making information and knowledge as available as possible...  Critically, Swartz didn&#039;t commit himself to these causes merely by talking about them or advocating for them. He repeatedly sacrificed his own interests, even his liberty, in order to defend these values and challenge and subvert the most powerful factions that were their enemies. That&#039;s what makes him, in my view, so consummately heroic... Swartz was destroyed by a &quot;justice&quot; system that fully protects the most egregious criminals as long as they are members of or useful to the nation&#039;s most powerful factions, but punishes with incomparable mercilessness and harshness those who lack power and, most of all, those who challenge power...Swartz knew all of this. But he forged ahead anyway. He could have easily opted for a life of great personal wealth, status, prestige and comfort. He chose instead to fight - selflessly, with conviction and purpose, and at great risk to himself - for noble causes to which he was passionately devoted. That, to me, isn&#039;t an example of heroism; it&#039;s the embodiment of it, its purest expression. It&#039;s the attribute our country has been most lacking.

12 Jan 2013

&#062; JSTOR did not press charges against Swartz after the digitized copies of the articles were returned, according to media reports at the time. Swartz, who pleaded not guilty to all counts, faced 35 years in prison and a $1 million fine if convicted. He was released on bond. His trial was scheduled to start later this year.  In a statement released Saturday, the family and partner of Swartz praised his &quot;brilliance&quot; and &quot;profound&quot; commitment to social justice, and struck out at what they said were decisions made at MIT and by prosecutors that contributed to his death.  &quot;Aaron&#039;s death is not simply a personal tragedy. It is the product of a criminal justice system rife with intimidation and prosecutorial overreach,&quot; the statement said.  &quot;The U.S. Attorney&#039;s office pursued an exceptionally harsh array of charges, carrying potentially over 30 years in prison, to punish an alleged crime that had no victims,&quot; it added.

The Brilliant Life and Tragic Death of Aaron Swartz
Matthew Yglesias
13 Jan 2013

&#062; Should people illegally duplicate academic research? I&#039;ll just say that the other day a friend mentioned to me an academic article that he was interested in and I thought the title and abstract were interesting too. But none of us could read it. So I went on Twitter and asked if any of the academics among my followers would send me a copy. Within an hour I had a couple dozen instances of the article in question, forwarded a copy to my friend, and we both read it. That to me seemed wonderful. The public directly and indirectly subsidizes an awful lot of academic research on the theory that knowledge is an important public good. So the public should have access to it! We should be able to arrange the institutions such that this vast storehouse of human knowledge is open to the world without people breaking into closets at MIT or having a large social media presence they can take advantage of.

Farewell to Aaron Swartz, an extraordinary hacker and activist
Peter Eckersley
12 Jan 2013 

&#062; Aaron did more than almost anyone to make the Internet a thriving ecosystem for open knowledge, and to keep it that way. His contributions were numerous, and some of them were indispensable.

Aaron Swartz, 1986-2013: a computer hacker who is now a political martyr
Virginia Heffernan
12 Jan 2013

&#062; Sample papers Swartz attempted to set free include &quot;John Berryman: The Poetics of Martyrdom&quot; and &quot;Mapping the Niger, 1798-1832: Trust, Testimony and &#039;Ocular Demonstration&#039; in the Late Enlightenment.&quot; On its own initiative, JSTOR, which hosts the academic papers and never pressed charges against Swartz, started offering limited free access to its archive just this week.

Aaron Swartz, Internet Pioneer, Found Dead Amid Prosecutor &#039;Bullying&#039; In Unconventional Case
12 Jan 2013

&#062; But the government pressed on, interpreting Swartz&#039;s actions as a federal crime, alleging mass theft, damaged computers and wire fraud, and suggesting that Swartz stood to gain financially. Federal prosecutors describe Swartz&#039;s downloading too quickly from a database to which JSTOR granted him and millions of other scholars free access as:

&#062; &quot;Aaron Swartz devised a scheme to defraud JSTOR of a substantial number of journal articles which they had invested in collecting, obtaining the rights to distribute and digitizing,&quot; the indictment reads. &quot;He sought to defraud MIT and JSTOR of rights and property.&quot; The prosecutors seem unaware that if an article is downloaded, the original copy remains with the owner.

&#062; The indictment also says that, &quot;Swartz intended to distribute these articles through one or more file-sharing sites.&quot; JSTOR has just released 4.5 million articles to public this week.

&#062; Aaron&#039;s recklessness put him right in harm&#039;s way. Aaron snuck into MIT and planted a laptop in a utility closet, used it to download a lot of journal articles (many in the public domain), and then snuck in and retrieved it. This sort of thing is pretty par for the course around MIT, and though Aaron wasn&#039;t an MIT student, he was a fixture in the Cambridge hacker scene, and associated with Harvard, and generally part of that gang, and Aaron hadn&#039;t done anything with the articles (yet), so it seemed likely that it would just fizzle out.

&#062; Instead, they threw the book at him. Even though MIT and JSTOR (the journal publisher) backed down, the prosecution kept on. I heard lots of theories: the feds who&#039;d tried unsuccessfully to nail him for the PACER/RECAP stunt had a serious hate-on for him; the feds were chasing down all the Cambridge hackers who had any connection to Bradley Manning in the hopes of turning one of them, and other, less credible theories. A couple of lawyers close to the case told me that they thought Aaron would go to jail.

The Truth about Aaron Swartz’s “Crime”
Alex Stamos
12 Jan 2013 

&#062;  I have led the investigation of dozens of computer crimes, from Latvian hackers blackmailing a stock brokerage to Chinese government-backed attacks against dozens of American enterprises. I have investigated small insider violations of corporate policy to the theft of hundreds of thousands of dollars, and have responded to break-ins at social networks, e-tailers and large banks. While we are no stranger to pro bono work, having served as experts on EFF vs Sony BMG and Sony vs Hotz, our reports have also been used in the prosecution of at least a half dozen attackers.  In short, I am no long-haired-hippy-anarchist who believes that anything goes on the Internet. I am much closer to the stereotypical capitalist-white-hat sellout that the antisec people like to rant about (and steal mail spools from) in the weeks before BlackHat.

&#062; I know a criminal hack when I see it, and Aaron’s downloading of journal articles from an unlocked closet is not an offense worth 35 years in jail.

Prosecutor as bully
Larry Lessig
12 Jan 2013

&#062; Early on, and to its great credit, JSTOR figured “appropriate” out: They declined to pursue their own action against Aaron, and they asked the government to drop its. MIT, to its great shame, was not as clear, and so the prosecutor had the excuse he needed to continue his war against the “criminal” who we who loved him knew as Aaron.

&#062; Here is where we need a better sense of justice, and shame. For the outrageousness in this story is not just Aaron. It is also the absurdity of the prosecutor’s behavior. From the beginning, the government worked as hard as it could to characterize what Aaron did in the most extreme and absurd way. The “property” Aaron had “stolen,” we were told, was worth “millions of dollars” — with the hint, and then the suggestion, that his aim must have been to profit from his crime. But anyone who says that there is money to be made in a stash of ACADEMIC ARTICLES is either an idiot or a liar. It was clear what this was not, yet our government continued to push as if it had caught the 9/11 terrorists red-handed.

&#062; In a country full of stupid laws – written by corrupt politicians, refined by maniacal bureaucrats, and enforced by ruthless careerists – few are stupider than the current version of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. On the surface it seems sensible, first passed in 1986 as a basic legal protection against unauthorized access of federal or major corporate computer systems the law has since expanded (with particular help from the PATRIOT Act) into an amorphous blob of contradictions that is only temporally congealed into a semblance of rational jurisprudence to offer a pretext for selective prosecutions. In short, the law has become a favorite club of the state to beat political dissidents with and so it is that in enforcing this asinine law a luminary of the internet has been hounded into an early grave.

Family blames US attorneys for death of Aaron Swartz
Megan Geuss
13 Jan 2013

&#062; On Saturday afternoon, Swartz&#039;s family and his partner released a statement ...  &quot;Aaron’s death is not simply a personal tragedy. It is the product of a criminal justice system rife with intimidation and prosecutorial overreach. Decisions made by officials in the Massachusetts US Attorney’s office and at MIT contributed to his death. The US Attorney’s office pursued an exceptionally harsh array of charges, carrying potentially over 30 years in prison, to punish an alleged crime that had no victims. Meanwhile, unlike JSTOR, MIT refused to stand up for Aaron and its own community’s most cherished principles.&quot;

Aaron Swartz, Coder and Activist, Dead at 26<br />
Kevin Poulsen<br />
13 Jan 2013</p>
<p>&gt; We often say, upon the passing of a friend or loved one, that the world is a poorer place for the loss. But with the untimely death of programmer and activist Aaron Swartz, this isn’t just a sentiment; it’s literally true. Worthy, important causes will surface without a champion equal to their measure. Technological problems will go unsolved, or be solved a little less brilliantly than they might have been. And that’s just what we know. The world is robbed of a half-century of all the things we can’t even imagine Aaron would have accomplished with the remainder of his life.</p>

12 Jan 2013</p>
<p>&gt; The open web and freedom of information in general lost one of their most passionate proponents yesterday, with the death of early Reddit staffer and Demand Progress founder Aaron Swartz, who committed suicide on Friday, according to a family member. He was facing federal charges for hacking into the JSTOR academic database and downloading millions of research papers, but had also reportedly suffered from depression. He was 26 years old.</p>

<p>&gt; Unfortunately, Aaron&#8217;s penchant for defying social convention may have been his undoing. He was arrested in 2011 for scraping articles from the academic archive JSTOR. Facing hacking charges that could put him in prison for decades, Aaron took his own life on Friday.</p>

The inspiring heroism of Aaron Swartz<br />
Glenn Greenwald<br />
12 Jan 2013</p>
<p>&gt;  he committed himself to the causes in which he so passionately believed: internet freedom, civil liberties, making information and knowledge as available as possible&#8230;  Critically, Swartz didn&#8217;t commit himself to these causes merely by talking about them or advocating for them. He repeatedly sacrificed his own interests, even his liberty, in order to defend these values and challenge and subvert the most powerful factions that were their enemies. That&#8217;s what makes him, in my view, so consummately heroic&#8230; Swartz was destroyed by a &#8220;justice&#8221; system that fully protects the most egregious criminals as long as they are members of or useful to the nation&#8217;s most powerful factions, but punishes with incomparable mercilessness and harshness those who lack power and, most of all, those who challenge power&#8230;Swartz knew all of this. But he forged ahead anyway. He could have easily opted for a life of great personal wealth, status, prestige and comfort. He chose instead to fight &#8211; selflessly, with conviction and purpose, and at great risk to himself &#8211; for noble causes to which he was passionately devoted. That, to me, isn&#8217;t an example of heroism; it&#8217;s the embodiment of it, its purest expression. It&#8217;s the attribute our country has been most lacking.</p>

<p>&gt; JSTOR did not press charges against Swartz after the digitized copies of the articles were returned, according to media reports at the time. Swartz, who pleaded not guilty to all counts, faced 35 years in prison and a $1 million fine if convicted. He was released on bond. His trial was scheduled to start later this year.  In a statement released Saturday, the family and partner of Swartz praised his &#8220;brilliance&#8221; and &#8220;profound&#8221; commitment to social justice, and struck out at what they said were decisions made at MIT and by prosecutors that contributed to his death.  &#8220;Aaron&#8217;s death is not simply a personal tragedy. It is the product of a criminal justice system rife with intimidation and prosecutorial overreach,&#8221; the statement said.  &#8220;The U.S. Attorney&#8217;s office pursued an exceptionally harsh array of charges, carrying potentially over 30 years in prison, to punish an alleged crime that had no victims,&#8221; it added.</p>

The Brilliant Life and Tragic Death of Aaron Swartz<br />
Matthew Yglesias<br />
13 Jan 2013</p>
<p>&gt; Should people illegally duplicate academic research? I&#8217;ll just say that the other day a friend mentioned to me an academic article that he was interested in and I thought the title and abstract were interesting too. But none of us could read it. So I went on Twitter and asked if any of the academics among my followers would send me a copy. Within an hour I had a couple dozen instances of the article in question, forwarded a copy to my friend, and we both read it. That to me seemed wonderful. The public directly and indirectly subsidizes an awful lot of academic research on the theory that knowledge is an important public good. So the public should have access to it! We should be able to arrange the institutions such that this vast storehouse of human knowledge is open to the world without people breaking into closets at MIT or having a large social media presence they can take advantage of.</p>
