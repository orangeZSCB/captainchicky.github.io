					<description><![CDATA[We&#039;re back!  For some reason the Wordpress &quot;strike&quot; software didn&#039;t seem to turn on at 8 am EST, so I waited a while, lost patience, then switched the blog to &quot;privately accessible only&quot; and went to sleep (it being night here in Singapore).  When I woke up it turned out the strike software was working.  But now the strike is over.  

And it seems to have done some good:

&#8226; Jonathan Weisman, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/19/technology/web-protests-piracy-bill-and-2-key-senators-change-course.html?partner=rss&#038;emc=rss&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;In fight over piracy bills, new economy rises against old&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;, 18 January 2012.

&#8226; Hayley Tsukayama and Sarah Halzack, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/senators-drop-support-of-piracy-bill-after-protests/2012/01/18/gIQA848M9P_story.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Senators drop support of piracy bill after protests&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;, 19 January 2012.

Chris Dodd, the chairman and CEO of the Motion Picture Association of America, fulminated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Only days after the White House and chief sponsors of the legislation responded to the major concern expressed by opponents and then called for all parties to work cooperatively together, some technology business interests are resorting to stunts that punish their users or turn them into their corporate pawns [...]

It is an irresponsible response and a disservice to people who rely on them for information and use their services. It is also an abuse of power given the freedoms these companies enjoy in the marketplace today. It’s a dangerous and troubling development when the platforms that serve as gateways to information intentionally skew the facts to incite their users in order to further their corporate interests.

A so-called blackout is yet another gimmick, albeit a dangerous one, designed to punish elected and administration officials who are working diligently to protect American jobs from foreign criminals.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But this is a good sign, actually: people recognize that he&#039;s living in another reality, and he&#039;s being &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.csoonline.com/1902/chris_dodds_strange_response_to_sopa_pipa_protests&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;taken to task for it&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>

Whoops, I went overboard a few minutes ago!  Thanks - fixed.

You should go on strike too.  It just takes a minute.]]></description>

They have not shelved the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/16/opinion/firewall-law-could-infringe-on-free-speech.html?_r=1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Protect IP Act&lt;/a&gt; or PIPA, which is the evil partner SOPA.  And they---the US Congress---need to hear from people before they realize that internet freedom has a constituency.  While you&#039;re taking a break from using Wikipedia, email your congresspeople so we don&#039;t need to do this again!]]></description>

Indeed, on Google+ we&#039;re also busy complaining about that!  These days the political life of an American intellectual is like bailing water out of a sinking rowboat.

Wordpress has made it easy to go on strike - we&#039;ll see if it works, but starting at 1 pm UTC (also known as 1 pm Greenwich Mean Time, or 8 am EST) on the 18th you should see a strike notice here instead of the usual blog.]]></description>
