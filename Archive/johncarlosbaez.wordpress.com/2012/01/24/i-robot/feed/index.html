					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/01/24/i-robot/#comment-13840&quot;&gt;RK&lt;/a&gt;.

Yes, thanks, I&#039;ve looked at it!  So should everyone here!   His blog is one of those I recommend on the right-hand side of this blog, under ALSO VISIT THESE.  

I&#039;ll try to summarize some of his results someday.  He&#039;s summarized his own work here:

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;http://physics.ucsd.edu/do-the-math/2012/02/the-alternative-energy-matrix/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Alternative Energy Matrix&lt;/a&gt;.

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;http://physics.ucsd.edu/do-the-math/2012/02/fossil-fuels-im-not-dead-yet/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Fossil Fuels: I&#039;m Not Dead Yet&lt;/a&gt;.

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;http://physics.ucsd.edu/do-the-math/2012/02/the-way-is-shut/#more&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Way is Shut&lt;/a&gt;.

Like many people who think hard about this stuff, he seems to be deciding we&#039;re close to being &#039;boxed in&#039;, even without taking global warming into consideration:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
One of my most compelling pieces of empirical evidence that we are at risk of collapse is the degree to which most folks I run into can’t entertain collapse as a serious possibility. In fact, I usually feel like such a kook even suggesting it that I rarely put it “out there” in casual interactions—even when relevant to the conversation. Usually, time does not allow conveyance of the extensive background that is necessary to lend credibility to such a statement. Look how many words I have spilled (about 100,000) in &lt;i&gt;Do the Math&lt;/i&gt; to justify my concerns.

In the face of serious resource challenges, I would hope to see more attention given to a high-stakes loss/collapse scenario. The opposite of attention is inattention, and that’s not going to help mitigate the problem.

&lt;h4&gt;Differentiating Opinion from Wisdom&lt;/h4&gt;

I only fell into this “limits” camp because practically every time I performed quantitative analyses on this, that, or the other alternative energy proposal, I came up disappointed. I really did want the pleasure of personal discovery that we have an obvious path forward. I am delighted by the abundance of solar energy input to the planet. I am reassured by the vastness of thermal energy in the oceans and crust. I am tentatively excited about the vast energy represented by uranium in the oceans and by thorium using functional molten salt reactors. I truly do see these as positive lights in the darkness.

Yet over and over, quantitative analysis knocks out many of the “exciting” ideas we hear about in the sensationalized media world. Already, this is a damaging blow to our collective perception that solutions abound. But the quantitative analysis does turn up a few gems that have the numbers behind them. Is this enough to allay my worries? Obviously not, or I would be merrily spending my time in ways other than writing a time-consuming blog on top of a very demanding research/teaching job.

Why am I stubbornly unconvinced by my own computations that show a few exit doorways lit up through the smoke? All I can offer is that I draw on my hunches as an experimental scientist. In that capacity, I build stuff that works. To do this, I have to be practical. I have to have a “spidey-sense” of what things are likely to succeed or fail—sometimes folding in political factors as well. I clearly don’t find all ideas to be impractical, or I would never have rushed headlong into the many projects that I have pursued.

I have on occasion found myself challenged about specific choices I made in designing an instrument by folks without instrument-building experience. Wouldn’t it have been better to choose a different size/value for X system? Theoretically, sure—if only narrowly considering one particular aspect. But I had to balance that choice against ten other competing considerations that are often difficult to articulate or even recall on the spot. Then I remember that the person asking the question has not personally experienced the compromises of building a complex instrument that works.

Likewise in imagining our future path. A complex, interrelating series of considerations will steer us one way or another. My hunch is that human nature, political realities, economics (including economic hardship) combined with technical shortcomings of alternatives will get in the way of our shiny future. I would like to be convinced that this isn’t the case so I can stop worrying and go full-force on my experimental physics career, but the arguments for why things will be alright often strike me as narrow or simplistic. “It’s obvious: we’ll go to space where resources are unlimited.” “You’re forgetting something very important: human ingenuity—an unlimited resource.” “More sun hits the Earth in an hour than we use in a year: it’s obvious we’ll solve this problem.” “We have enough fuel sitting in nuclear waste pools to power us for millennia.” “Peak oil will not be a problem because we have tons more hydrocarbons in the ground beyond conventional petroleum.” You get the picture: a key idea that will make everything work out. It has the same ring as “Home prices in San Diego can never go down because it is such a desirable place to live,” which I ignored in 2005 in favor of data and more complex analyses.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, he&#039;s not giving up yet:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It was always implicit for me that work invested into science will stand for all time. But the notion that my contribution to science—however incremental—may be irrevocably lost has taken some of the appeal away, I must admit. It would seem prudent, then, for scientists to devote time and talent toward our impending energy challenges. The first step is to convince people that we must swing our attention hard-over toward understanding exactly how we wean ourselves off of the fossil fuel lifeblood of our society. Either we figure it out or Mother Nature will do it for us. I for one want to fight to keep humanity’s most impressive achievements intact and understood!
&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m working with a young company that&#039;s still building out its culture as its considering expansion into new cities. Normalization of our culture is pretty important, and while we intend to send established employees to the new office in order to &quot;inoculate it with awesome&quot; (to help set the tone for our culture), there&#039;s still the issue of ensuring ongoing communication in the long term. It seems most organizations deal with this by flying people back and forth, keeping communication open.

We&#039;re trying to think of alternatives to this approach. One idea is to place cameras behind a doorway in each office, and to display the doorway through two stacked flatscreens in the other offices. So when we have two offices, each gets a doorway (built to look like a real doorway, with trimmings and everything), so that the sights and sounds of the other office come a constantly broadcast. So if there&#039;s a nerf fight in one office on a friday, the other can get a kick out of it as well.

More offices means more doorways. Kinda like the clocks in an oldschool newsroom.

It would be nice if we could sort out a way to properly mount a camera on the setup so that interaction between people in different offices can feel more natural. We&#039;re envisioning it mainly as a culture-control tool, but it could likely be used to morning stand-up meetings if the communication felt smooth enough.

Anyhow, I&#039;ve spoken to a few people at tech conferences about the idea, and other have expressed excitement, but it&#039;s still vaporware at this point. When we do get around to it, it will clearly be open-sourced, because that&#039;s just how we roll :)

Anyhow, hopefully the talk goes well. Really cool premise. We&#039;ve been looking for an opportunity to have a co-op student build a robot like yours as an arduino project for our remote workers, so it hit home!]]></description>

If you haven&#039;t already seen it, http://carfree.com/ gives some ideas on how the car might be eradicated -- including plans on how to get there from here. It&#039;s not specifically aimed at reducing energy usage, but that&#039;s a nice side benefit :)]]></description>

1. Technological innovations like The Green Revolution (although in spite of the name it is not good for nature) or better Jane Goodall Roots &#038; Shoots, but they are not good examples. 
2. Scientific. Atom theory of Democritus, Darwins theory of Evolution. The ideas of Hendrik Lorentz, Einsteins special and general Relativity. [Or the octonion model of gravity: m^2 = E^2 - p^2 as an (hyperbolic-)quaternion, it is strange that m^2 would be the norm. Therefore m^2 - q^2 = E^2 - p^2 is more likely  (given velocity v, q = Ev). The same for t^2 - x^2 = f^2 - b^2 (f = xv  and b = fv), The metrics merged together by G for octonions... Just kidding.] But also quantummechanics as a paradigm shift. Wegener continental drift, The Out of Africa theory. But paradigm shifts do not really count as breaking concensus. 
3. Concensus concerns political ideology. Abolition movement, women&#039;s suffrage, animal liberation, fall of communism, Politicians talking about bankruptcy of Greece, Arab revolt. They al start when the conditions are ripe. 

Conclusion: No I can&#039;t think of a real example of breaking the concensus. Only small scale, like the culture within a corporation. All those broken concensus are within the framework of society-centric thinking. 

I don&#039;t know if breaking the concensus works. I believe in it. It is my own Sun Dance. Whether or not as the result of Peak Oil, the more the economies show cracks, the more western people are vulnerable for different kinds of revolt. The politicians have no answer. They are in deadlock. Fighting between ideologies is a Machiavellian fight. There are no rules. Even in contemporary politics. Maybe I don&#039;t succeed. Many freedom fighters lost their cause. So be it. The winner write the history books. Christian ideology won from al kind of religions and wrote their books. America won from the indians and from the South and they wrote their history books. And too often the winner dictates what is right and wrong.

The coming decade economies do poorly to never get up. BRIC countries keep on growing. Oil will be harder to achieve. Peak oil is coming. Worst case scenario: even after Peak Oil economies go on until the last oil is burnt. The scenario that we can convince people to leave the rest of the oil in the earth is unlikely, given the behaviour of the economical-societal system. So maybe we must accelerate the speed of economy by means of oil consumption to facilitate the moment of Peak Oil. Then the system has less time to adapt to the situation of scarcity. Every usage of energy stimulates society and as a result the destruction of nature.

&quot;Some early papers raised the question of the discrepancy of the standard IPCC scenarions and the peak oil projections. The first one was probably Jean Laherrere with a paper published in 2001. Later on Anders Sivertsson , Kjell Aleklett and Colin Campbell wrote in 2003 in &#039;The New Scientist&#039; a paper titled &#039;Not enough oil for climate change&#039;. They criticized the IPCC scenarios for being overoptimistic in terms of oil and gas reserves. These early papers didn&#039;t attempt to calculate the future concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere.&quot;
