					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t trust McKinsey. One option I calculated and installed is insulation. In my clime. this made even more sense than efficient lighting, altho i did that too. I crawled in my ceiling and laid outta buncha fiberglass, and it paid off in one year of HVAC electric + natgas bills. Wear a hardhat, scalp gashes from nails are painful and bleed heavily. And mask,gloves,long sleeves. Do the work when temps up there not extreme. A rake helps. Or just pay someone to do.

&quot;We&quot; means &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;.  Yes, you have limited powers---but you should use those powers as best you can to get the job done.  

(Or not, if you disagree with my recommendations.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You sometimes say &quot;we&quot; need to do things. But who is this person?  Obligations are laid upon &quot;us&quot; but the states in the eurozone cannot even fix their currency, the Canadians seem to have bailed out of Kyoto, the Chinese have their own climate scientists and anyway are cursed by old fashioned pollution, the Indians - well I don&#039;t know about them. The Austalians who inhabit a large and largely uninhabitable chunk of land are pretty passionate about climate chnage (in various directions). But there is no &quot;we&quot; because there is no single demos, people, state, corresponding to everywhere on Earth.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I live on the Atherton Tablelands of North Queensland and for the last three years we have had very little summer weather due to a light cloud cover, in fact some nights the air becomes quite cold. It would appear that the great thermostats, the oceans, react quite aggressively to less than one degree of temperature change. Approximately ten to twelve years ago we struggled to keep our small patch of lawn grass alive because our spring supplying our house water had been reduced to a trickle. The general colour in the entire airier of North Queensland was brown. Now with plentiful rain, the colour is emerald green covering most of Australia due to rapid lush growth. The difference in growth must be having quite an influence as to how long CO2 stays in the atmosphere.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There are lots of critiques of so-called &quot;marginal abatement curves&quot; like McKinsey&#039;s. One can be found here: 

http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14693062.2011.582347

The last point in the following extract from their abstract is for me the most telling: the lack of transparency.

Legal commitments to reduce CO2 emissions require policy makers to find cost-efficient means to meet these obligations. Marginal abatement cost (MAC) curves, which illustrate the economics associated with climate change mitigation, have recently attracted a great amount of attention. A number of limitations with MAC curves are explained by the implication they should be just one tool in a broader set of decision-making aids used in assessing climate policy. MAC curves, for example, omit ancillary benefits of greenhouse gas emission abatement, treat uncertainty in a limited manner, exclude intertemporal dynamics and lack the necessary transparency concerning their assumptions.]]></description>
