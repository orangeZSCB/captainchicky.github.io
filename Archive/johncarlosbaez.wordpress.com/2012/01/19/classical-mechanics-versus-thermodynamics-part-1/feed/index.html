What is the philosophy behind the general idea:  (quantity) = (conjugate1) - (conjugate2), e.g., the Lagrangian dS = Tdt -Vdt.

Roy Frieden has introduced the Extreme physical information principle, but it&#039;s a controversial idea. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_physical_information]]></description>

In all relativistic theories of classical point particles you can write the action as

$latex S = \int L(q(s), q&#039;(s)) \, ds $

where $latex s$ is an arbitrary parameter, not necessarily arclength.  (Indeed, for particles moving at the speed of light the arclength is zero, so it&#039;s no good as a parameter!)

You can see this done e.g. starting in Section 3.5.2 of this book:

It&#039;s just a draft but it&#039;s fairly readable.]]></description>

Ah, I think I&#039;ve got it! Thanks a lot.

I suppose the awkward bit would be finding an expression for the action that is also agnostic with respect to the choice of time coordinate. A physical theory with action $latex S = \int L dt$ does seem to give a special role to $latex t$, while it&#039;s much more elegant to parametrise $latex \gamma$ by arc length as you did and never have to mention time at all.

I wonder if it would turn into a field theory at that point, though.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I think what I don’t understand is what role the HPF plays in this recipe for mechanics. Is it:
1. Use some minimisation procedure to find path
2. Evaluate HPF for that path
3. Decide which $latex q^i$ represents time, label $latex \partial S/\partial t$ as $latex -H,$ and hence derive Hamilton’s equations
?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yes, that&#039;s about right.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In which case I think I was looking for step 1 somewhere in your post, and getting confused.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I explained it here:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
 Suppose we have a particle on the line. Consider smooth paths where it starts at some fixed position at some fixed time and ends at the point $latex q$ at the time $latex t$. Nature will choose a path with least action—or at least one that’s a stationary point of the action. Let’s assume there’s a unique such path, and that it depends smoothly on $latex q$ and $latex t$. For this to be true, we may need to restrict $latex q$ and $latex t$ to a subset of the plane, but that’s okay: go ahead and pick such a subset.

Given $latex q$ and $latex t$ in this set, nature will pick the path that’s a stationary point of action; the action of this path is called &lt;b&gt;Hamilton’s principal function&lt;/b&gt; and denoted $latex S(q,t).$ (Beware: this $latex S$ is not the same as entropy!)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Of course this is just a special case of a more general procedure.  For example we could consider a spacetime manifold $latex M$ and fix a point $latex p \in M.$

Suppose we can define a quantity called the &#039;action&#039; for any path $latex \gamma : [0,1] \to M$.  Suppose there is a unique action-minimizing path from $latex p$ to any point $latex q \in M$.  Then given $latex q \in M$, let $latex S(q)$ be the action of the action-minimizing path from $latex x_0$ to the point $latex q.$   Then

$latex S : M \to \mathbb{R}$

is &lt;b&gt;Hamilton&#039;s principal function&lt;/b&gt;, and starting from here we can derive Hamilton&#039;s equations as explained in my blog article.

We can work in arbitrary coordinates and write the coordinates of $latex q$ as $latex q^i.$  We don&#039;t need to choose one coordinate and call it &#039;time&#039;: the formalism doesn&#039;t really require that.  Hamilton&#039;s equations are really just the trivial statement that

$latex \displaystyle{ \frac{\partial^2 S}{\partial q^i \partial q^j}  = \frac{\partial^2 S}{\partial q^j \partial q^i}    }   $

Here I&#039;m assuming that everything is as differentiable as we want it to be, and just to be careful I&#039;m assuming there&#039;s a unique action-minimizing path.  The second assumption is false when there are &#039;caustics&#039;.]]></description>

<p>We can work in arbitrary coordinates and write the coordinates of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="q" class="latex" /> as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q%5Ei.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="q^i." class="latex" />  We don&#8217;t need to choose one coordinate and call it &#8216;time&#8217;: the formalism doesn&#8217;t really require that.

Sorry, I meant integrating $latex dS $.

I think what I don&#039;t understand is what role the HPF plays in this recipe for mechanics. Is it:
1. Use some minimisation procedure to find path
2. Evaluate HPF for that path
3. Decide which $latex q^i $ represents time, label $latex \partial S/\partial t $ as $latex -H $, and hence derive Hamilton&#039;s equations
?

In which case I think I was looking for step 1 somewhere in your post, and getting confused.

Incidentally, I find methods like this that put time and space coordinates on an equal footing to be very attractive -- as far as I&#039;m concerned, they only differ because they show up in different places in a Lorentzian metric. However, looking it up it seems that this is called &#039;non-autonomous mechanics&#039; and is in general fairly tricky, e.g. I found http://arxiv.org/pdf/math-ph/0604063.pdf

(Though the text you posted http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/toby/Hamiltonian.pdf also seems to apply to this case, though it seems to assume you&#039;ve already picked a hypersurface, and doesn&#039;t contain any details of a minimisation procedure)]]></description>

Given that the integral of Hamilton&#039;s principal function over a path seems only to depend on the difference $latex S(q_\mathrm{end}) - S(q_\mathrm{start})$, what is the result of &#039;minimising S&#039;? It surely can&#039;t be a path. Or perhaps I&#039;m missing something crucial about how to integrate $latex S$?]]></description>
