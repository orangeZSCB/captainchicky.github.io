					<description><![CDATA[There exist a deep analogy between statistical mechanics and quantum mechanics. In particular, both statistical theories support the existence of complementary quantities and non-commuting operators, where the entropy appears as a counterpart of classical action. In my opinion, this connection strongly suggests the development of extremal principles for nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, where the notion of complementarity would play a relevant role. More details about this subject can be found in my recent paper

In each example, I&#039;m just doing a formal replacement and trying to come up with a plausible story as to why such a system might arise.  I thought it was OK to do that, since it&#039;s not particularly clear to me how you&#039;d build your &quot;springy&quot; system, either.

Let&#039;s just talk about the second example I gave, the &quot;thermometer system&quot;.  There are composite materials like SiC/Al fibers whose thermal expansion coefficient $latex \alpha$ depends on the coolness $latex \beta$. (http://www.waset.org/journals/waset/v78/v78-179.pdf)  A rod made out of this stuff has an equilibrium length $latex q(\beta)$ that&#039;s also a function of the coolness, given by integrating $latex \alpha(T) dT.$  If we fix the length of the rod and then cool it, it will have some stretching potential energy $latex K(\beta).$  We can also toss in some other kind of potential energy $latex V$ that depends on $latex q(\beta)$ just to make the analogy closer.  The entropy lost upon cooling it is the integral of the stretching potential energy plus the extra potential energy.  Minimizing this entropy while keeping the initial and final equilibrium lengths fixed becomes a materials science question: which composite produces the best $latex q(\beta)$?]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Maybe you could do a new version with more explanation and fewer equations?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I know you were talking to your brother Mike, but you&#039;ve just nudged me into saying a bit myself...

&lt;blockquote&gt;
What aspects of the analogy exist on one side but are unnamed on the other, so are new discoveries about the other side? 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first thing to note is that Mike is not talking about an analogy between two sides, but at least &lt;i&gt;four&lt;/i&gt; sides, and perhaps more.  The main four are:

&#8226; In classical dynamics, a system like a thrown rock will trace out the path that minimizes action.

&#8226; In classical statics, a system like a hanging spring traces out the path that minimizes energy.

&#8226; In thermal statics, a system in thermal equilibrium like a box of gas will occupy different states with different probabilities in a way that maximizes entropy.

&#8226; In quantum dynamics, a system like a thrown &lt;i&gt;quantum&lt;/i&gt; rock will trace out different paths with different amplitudes in a way that makes the first derivative of quantropy zero.

The analogy between the first two was explained (&lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Scientific American&lt;/i&gt; fashion) in my problem set &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/classical/spring.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;A Spring in Imaginary Time&lt;/a&gt;.  The concept of quantropy is described in my blog post &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/12/22/quantropy/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Quantropy&lt;/a&gt;.  

Infinitely more famous than either of these are &lt;i&gt;other&lt;/i&gt; aspects of the analogy between thermal statics and quantum dynamics: people use this analogy to do things like calculate the mass of the proton from first principles.  If anyone was really going to write a &lt;i&gt;Scientific American&lt;/i&gt; article on this material, that would be the place to start.  It&#039;s incredibly important, but I&#039;ve never seen anyone try to explain it to ordinary folks.

Mike is trying to push these analogies further than I&#039;d done. So far I only understand certain portions of what he&#039;s written.  The portions I understand seem right, but I can&#039;t vouch for the whole thing yet.  

Here are some things I don&#039;t understand:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Substitute &lt;i&gt;q(β = iz)&lt;/i&gt; for &lt;i&gt;q(t)&lt;/i&gt; to get a thermometer system.&lt;/h4&gt;

We can repeat the process above, but use inverse temperature, or &quot;coolness&quot;, instead of time.  Note that this is still a statics problem at heart!  We&#039;ll introduce another temperature below when we allow for multiple possible &lt;i&gt;q&lt;/i&gt;&#039;s.

$latex K$ is the potential energy due to rate of change of $latex q$ with respect to $latex \beta$.  (This has to do with the thermal expansion coefficient: if we fix length of the thermometer and then cool it, we get &quot;stretching&quot; potential energy.)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I don&#039;t understand what&#039;s going on here.  Mike seems to be treating the length of a thermometer as a function of temperature, or more precisely the reciprocal of temperature &#946;.    But I don&#039;t understand the assumptions in this game---like what laws of physics we&#039;re assuming, or what&#039;s a function of what.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Substitute &lt;i&gt;q(T₁ = iz)&lt;/i&gt; for &lt;i&gt;q(t)&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/h4&gt;
We can repeat the process above, but use temperature instead of time. We get a system whose heat capacity is governed by a function $latex q(T)$ and its derivative.  We&#039;re trying to find the best function $latex q$, the most efficient way to raise the temperature of the system.

$latex C$ is the heat capacity (= entropy) proportional to $latex (dq/dT_1)^2$.

$latex V$ is the heat capacity due to $latex q.$
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Again, I don&#039;t understand what&#039;s going on here.  And now I don&#039;t even have a mental image (like a thermometer) to cling to.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Allow quantum superpositions of thermometers.&lt;/h4&gt;

$latex \langle S_1\rangle = \sum &#124;a_x&#124;^2 S_{1,x}.$ 

Get $latex a_x = \exp(-S_{1,x}/T_2) / Z.$  If $latex T_2 = -i,$ we get something like a sum over histories, but with a different normalization condition that converges because our set of paths is finite.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ditto.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Allow quantum superposition of systems.&lt;/h4&gt;

$latex \langle E \rangle = \sum &#124;a_x&#124;^2 E_x.$  

Get $latex a_x =\exp(-E_x/kT_2) / Z.$ If $latex T_2 = -i\hbar/tk,$ we get the result of &quot;Measure &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;, then heat the superposition &lt;i&gt;T₁&lt;/i&gt; degrees in a time much less than &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; seconds, then wait &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; seconds.&quot;  Different functions &lt;i&gt;q&lt;/i&gt; in the superposition change the heat capacity differently and thus the systems end up at different energies.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ditto.  I&#039;m afraid I need more help to understand these four items.]]></description>
