					<description><![CDATA[I would like to support Nathan Urban&#039;s emphasis on robust decisions. In addition to Rob Lempert&#039;s RDM (Robust Decision Making), I&#039;d like to point the community to info-gap theory. Info-gap has been used for strategic planning and decision under severe uncertainty in many disciplines, including climate change, biological conservation, engineering, economics, homeland security, medicine, and more. Examples, background material, and lots of references by workers around the world can be found at http://info-gap.com. In particular, sources on biological conservation and related topics can be found on the sub-page http://info-gap.com/content.php?id=12.

					<description><![CDATA[Excellent post Curtis. The 24/7 crisis of ER is perfect for this kind of meditation. I suspect though, that the training and experience of ER doctors conceals a further quality that is vital for dealing with uncertainty and risk: resilience in the face of failure. The best engagement strategies are for nought if we crumple and fold the moment we fail. This is why, in my classes on Philosophy for Change, I underscore the value of taking a Stoic attitude towards uncertain environments. One should accept that, ultimately, all that one can control are one&#039;s judgements and responses to adversity. This is not an advocation of inwardsness - the Stoics were active agents, particularly in the political sphere. But they never allowed themselves to believe that their manifest power guarranteed them positive outcomes. When things failed, they would acknowlede that their ultimate capacity lay in getting a grip on themselves, mastering self-recrimination and despondency, and pushing ahead with a new approach. I expect this is an attitude that ER docs aquire the course of training. The rest of us have to constantly remind ourselves of the importance of the lesson.]]></description>

But there are other contraints (time etc) so it&#039;s not the case that more evidence is necessarily better. I am related to MDs, and all have at times called for more tests merely so they could lay down and nap - who could argue that &quot;more evidence to better decide&quot;? In fact, Curtis Faith&#039;s main point was that what is needed is a better framework for making decisions without more evidence.

All Americans of a certain age know &quot;If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice.&quot; from Rush&#039;s Freewill

					<description><![CDATA[That was a fairly lengthy analogy, but what I got out of it was that the longer the chain of evidence that you get to support a medical diagnostic decision, the better off you are. In this sense, knowledge is power, and I think that fits the theme of Azimuth.]]></description>

Curtis said:&lt;blockquote&gt;Power doesn’t like change.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Alas it&#039;s not just power, but also human psychology. E.g. the folks who earned their pension funds in fossil fuelled boom times and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirtschaftswunder&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;wirtschaftswunder&lt;/a&gt;s.

Curtis Faith asks: &lt;i&gt;To me, this depends critically on getting smart people who share our goals working together with us. If anyone has any suggestions for how we might accomplish this, we’d love to hear them.&lt;/i&gt;

Ed Wilson provides this three concrete suggestion (from &lt;i&gt;Anthill&lt;/i&gt;, p.&#160;348):&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Raff lived by three maxims.  Fortune favors the prepared mind.  People follow someone who knows where he&#039;s going.  And control the middle, because that&#039;s where the extremes eventually have to meet.:&lt;/blockquote&gt;Wilson&#039;s track record at &quot;making a difference&quot; is outstanding ... and this advice follows a career that spans most of the 20th century ... and so his suggestions are worth taking seriously.]]></description>

It is my personal opinion that the success of the Azimuth Project will depend almost entirely on the type of people who have already joined and who will join over the next few months. This will set the tone for the work that follows.

We will learn what worked and what didn&#039;t work. An analysis of past failures and successes will be helpful. 

I&#039;m pretty familiar with failure of various sorts. I&#039;ve had a lot of practice. :-) New independent volunteer projects are different than large-scale projects like NASA or Intel might undertake. They are inherently more fragile so the failure modes are different from my experience.

Right now, the Azimuth Project is a volunteer organization still in its infancy. So the most important factors for success will be making sure we maintain a critical mass of people doing ongoing work and learning how to grow at the right pace so we can continue to improve the information we have in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Azimuth+Library&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Azimuth Library&lt;/a&gt; and accomplish the other &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Azimuth+Project+goals&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Azimuth Project goals&lt;/a&gt; without diffusing our focus.

To me, this depends critically on getting smart people who share our goals working together with us. If anyone has any suggestions for how we might accomplish this, we&#039;d love to hear them.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;In this particular case that logical contradiction points to essential parts of the economy at odds with each other, and would naturally produce escalating strain on each other until something fails. Would you think that sort of rather visible systemic problem, largely “hidden in sight” for everyone, is the kind a thing that should stimulate the mind of a real scientist, and might also be worth attending to?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yes. In fact, you have pointed out one of the reasons I am not optimistic that we will avoid big problems. I don&#039;t think we&#039;ll see any changes until &quot;something fails.&quot;

There are many people looking at new ways to do business, and new ideas for the economy. One of my favorites is &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.hbr.org/haque/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Umair Haque at the Havas Media Lab at Harvard&lt;/a&gt;. There are certainly many people talking about how to reduce consumption and get away from a growth-at-all-costs economy. But I don&#039;t expect these people or their ideas to be popular until we have some big crises of various sorts.

I also agree that the meta problem you&#039;ve pointed out is at the source of the climate issues. I believe there are a couple other meta problems that impact the status quo as well.

Systemic problems of the sort you describe are not going to be fixed absent some large major crisis or two. There is simply too much power aligned behind the status quo to expect any changes in systemic problems of any sort. 

History demonstrates than mankind is not very good at change without crisis. Power doesn&#039;t like change. It fights it tooth and nail.]]></description>
