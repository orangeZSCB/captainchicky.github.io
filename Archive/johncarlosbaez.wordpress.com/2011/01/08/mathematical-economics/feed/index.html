Hi, Bruce! I haven&#039;t heard from &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; for a long time.  Yes, Schommer-Pries has a completely general definition of &#039;symmetric monoidal bicategory&#039;, and Mike has found his paper very helpful.  But Paddy McCrudden, a student of Street was the first to write down this definition.  He did it in his thesis.  You can see it in the appendix here:

&#8226; Paddy McCrudden, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.emis.de/journals/TAC/volumes/7/n6/7-06abs.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Balanced coalgebroids&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Theory and Applications of Categories&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt; (2000), 71-147.]]></description>

In Chris Schommer-Pries&#039;s thesis, he writes down quite a general definition of symmetric monoidal bicategory. Not sure if this is what you&#039;re looking for?]]></description>

I think most quants would argue they helped limit the damage. A somewhat related idea is analysis paralysis

To be fair, it&#039;s unclear if the &quot;quants&quot; have caused their meltdown &lt;em&gt;yet&lt;/em&gt;, although they may very, very well do so in the near future (with HFT). The areas of the financial system that caused huge problems weren&#039;t, to my understanding, those involving the physics based mathematical models. They were incredibly arcane and complicated financial instruments, but that was more from the formalisation of what economists and clients wanted.]]></description>

In addition to correct accounting of income, it would help to have correct accounting of everything. &quot;Incorrect accounting&quot; is another way of saying &quot;cheating&quot;.

John, That’s a succinct way to say it but for one major omission.    It wouldn’t change the outcome a bit to make “the rich” each walk the plank and disappear into the sea as their greed reached a certain level, the non-rich would just assume ownership of their assets and do precisely the same thing with them.    The simple problem is that ALL our financial plans and institutions are built on a model of investing in things we can all trust will give us a good return.   It’s not just everyone’s search to invest in things that they can be confident of producing a good return.    What then seals our and their fates is the real hidden intent of doing that, to have reliable compounding of returns.    

That’s what everyone tries to stabilize, but for natural cause cannot be, pointing to the great rift between the information world in our heads and the physical world of our bodies.    We look for investments to believe in and trust for the purpose of adding our winnings to our bets in them.   Since they are physical things and not formulas, that assures they will become untrustworthy and collapse taking the environment that created them down too!      

The catch for explaining it seems to be that if the listener doesn’t have some suspicion that our information reality and our physical reality might be different, then they just hear it as just someone talking about something else they don’t recognize… and ignore it.]]></description>
