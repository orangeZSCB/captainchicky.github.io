					<description><![CDATA[Dear John,

Myself and some friends are interested in the analogies between random walks and electrical networks.  We are familiar with the descriptions of resitors and voltages in terms of absorbing random walks but we would like to see similar analogies for capacitors and inductors, but we have not found (or being able to create ourselves) any yet.  You mentioned here that you were working on something like that.  I would appreciate it if you would point out an appropriate reference.

Also, the way the analogy works for a network of resistors requires a source and a sink while for a network of capacitors we are thinking of a closed system where a unit of charge is injected and a dynamical process unforlded until that charge is distributed amond all the capacitors.  Would then the same interpretation of a resistor and voltage still apply?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/01/18/petri-nets/#comment-4137&quot;&gt;Allowa&lt;/a&gt;.

Natural systems thrive without needing to continually expand their scale, but economies must do so for their temporal stability.  Figure that out.   That&#039;s what would save the earth.  

It&#039;s really interesting in the world&#039;s best data from 1970 shows that the relative rates of GDP, energy and CO2 production have remained completely constant.  That indicates that the economy has a logic as a physical system of its own.  It also means that the initial concept for how to use new kinds of growth to decouple energy and carbon from it is a complete and total failure, not showing the least bit of effect of any kind.

It&#039;s not so mysterious to people who study economies as behavioral systems rather than theoretical systems, but the difference isn&#039;t mathematical so needs to be discussed in another forum.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[How can we save the planet?

Please, be precise, all we can save is humanity, or animals. 
Planet is not in danger, it will not be harmed. It&#039;s only us. I don&#039;t like the way ecologists say that we need to get altogether for the earth.. no, it&#039;s not true. We must move from our daily thinking ways because our habits are threatened.

Although, I&#039;m quite concerned by all the stuff you post here, thank you for it.]]></description>

I&#039;ll check it out.  When I first learned I&#039;d be going to Singapore, I had a dream of spending a lot of time composing and recording electronic music.   It&#039;s so much fun!  But then I got this goofy &#039;save the planet&#039; idea and the music went out the window.  

Well, I still play it in my mind...

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/01/18/petri-nets/#comment-3895&quot;&gt;Aaron Denney&lt;/a&gt;.

I wouldn&#039;t want to write most programs in a Petri-net-based language.  On the other hand, I wouldn&#039;t want to program with Turing machines, either &#8212; yet they&#039;ve served as a good framework for investigating some theoretical issues.  Maybe Petri nets are a good framework for theoretical issues related to concurrency, in a similar way.  I don&#039;t know.

I&#039;m coming to the subject from a different angle.  What I like is using Petri nets to describe chemical reactions, at least after we assign a &quot;reaction rate&quot; to each transition.  If you&#039;re not permanently scarred by your previous experience, I recommend taking a quick peek at:

&#8226; Darren J. Wilkinson, &lt;i&gt;Stochastic Modelling for Systems Biology&lt;/i&gt;, Chapman and Hall, New York, 2006.

It may give you a different outlook on Petri nets!]]></description>
