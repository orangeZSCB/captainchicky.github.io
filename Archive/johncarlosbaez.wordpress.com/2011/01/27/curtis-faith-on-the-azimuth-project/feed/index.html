What &lt;b&gt;would&lt;/b&gt; you like to see? What does something big enough look like? What do you think is missing here?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For something to be big enough, it can&#039;t be provincial.  It can&#039;t be limited to United States, Europe, Japan, Australia, Canada and a few other already wealthy countries.  I bet the big emerging economies like China and India will make the difference between an environmental strategy that works and one that doesn&#039;t.  

That said, the already wealthy countries are important &#039;role models&#039;.  What people in the US and Europe have, people in China and India want.

So, let me &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;just for now&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; focus on the already wealthy countries, where I understand a bit more about what consumers can do to affect corporate behavior.

I think one big problem is that consumers can&#039;t easily see the environmental impacts of their purchasing decisions.  Without this information, a crucial feedback loop is missing.  It&#039;s like driving a car without a speedometer.  Or worse: a car without headlights, on a dark road!

Suppose when you bought a product you could easily see its &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.treehugger.com/files/2007/05/carbon_footprin.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;carbon footprint&lt;/a&gt;, its &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.treehugger.com/files/2008/04/water-ratings-for-food-labelling.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;water footprint&lt;/a&gt; and so on.  Might that affect your decisions? 

Right now you can go to a website and see some rough average figures.  For example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.treehugger.com/files/2009/06/from-lettuce-to-beef-whats-water-footprint-of-your-food.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this website&lt;/a&gt; says a pound of tofu takes 244 gallons of water to make, while a pound of chicken takes 814, and a pound of beef takes 2500-5000.   But just think how much better it would be if you could easily compare specific figures for different brands while you were at the store!  Then companies would be more motivated to do better.

(I apologize for using the barbaric &#039;British&#039; system of measurements; I usually translate everything to metric but I&#039;m feeling lazy today.  I also apologize for the ridiculously precise figures of &#039;244&#039; and &#039;814&#039; side-by-side with the ridiculously broad range of &#039;2500-5000&#039; &#8212; but that&#039;s part of what I&#039;m complaining about.)

We could try to make companies put this sort of  information on the label.  We could try to pass a law, or try to shame them into doing it.  But in the wealthy countries, maybe we could get around this step and just do it ourselves!  Some wonderful things are possible nowadays.  How about an iPhone app?  And someday soon every piece of merchandise in a big chain store should have an individual &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio-frequency_identification&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;radio-frequency identification&lt;/a&gt; tag on it, so with cleverness maybe one could just point a gadget at it and see crowdsourced information about it.  (Not just environmental information, but whether you can get it more cheaply across the street!)  

Another thing I really want is a smart energy grid, where you can see how much energy your appliances are using!  Right now this information is darn hard to get... so not everyone realizes how &lt;i&gt;terrible&lt;/i&gt; it is to, say, store frozen food in an extra freezer in the garage, especially an old inefficient one.  But if they saw that 20% of their monthly electricity bill was going into that freezer, they might catch on.  

There are probably dozens of tricks that people have already thought about... ways to build crucial feedback loops that are currently missing.  We need clever people who can figure out ways for people to &lt;i&gt;make money&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;save money&lt;/i&gt; with better feedback.

It&#039;s important to know what gives the biggest bang for the buck.  These reports are really helpful:

&#8226; McKinsey and Company, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mckinsey.com/clientservice/sustainability/greenhousegas.asp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Reducing U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions: How Much at What Cost?&lt;/a&gt;.

&#8226;  McKinsey and Company, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mckinsey.com/clientservice/sustainability/pathways_low_carbon_economy.asp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pathways to a Low-Carbon Economy&lt;/a&gt;.

So what is “economic pressure” anyway, and how can it be adjusted?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The two most common ways to bring economic pressure, as I used it above, are:

1) Reduced consumption - A boycott of a company&#039;s products is the traditional means of pressuring a company. It is the easiest to effect.

2) Stock sales - Divestiture of stock is another means of bringing economic pressure. It can result in the stock price dropping significantly enough that boards and management change direction.

Corporations have revenue and expenses and they want to maximize their profits (revenues - expenses). Economic pressure is anything that reduces or threatens to reduce corporate profits by significantly reducing revenues or increasing expenses. 

If the pressure is selective, it is more effective, e.g. if only one company in a particular industry is pressured it will have greater effect on that company because consumers will be able to meet their needs indefinitely and the relative competitive position of the company may not return to the status quo ante when the pressure is released. Consumers may not switch back.

Corporations are owned by investors who don&#039;t want to see the value of their investments drop. So anything that affects the stock price directly or indirectly concerns investors. This can sometimes cause a snowball effect. A drop in price, can itself cause in a further drop in price.

There are other more sophisticated ways to bring economic pressure that are now possible. For example, one could have secondary boycott&#039;s of wholesale or industrial suppliers. For example, if you wanted to affect a company that sold a particular type of packaging, you could threaten to boycott the users of that packaging unless they switched to an alternative supplier. If the threat was credible, this would cause the original supplier to lose business because the industrial consumers would make the switch because they, in turn, would not want to lose business.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;It’s worth noting that loudly expressed consumer preferences already can push companies towards environmentally sounder policies.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yes it certainly can. It doesn&#039;t take as many people as one might think. Especially for mass-market companies that care about their reputation.

&lt;blockquote&gt;So far, however, it’s happening in ways that are a lot smaller than I’d like.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

What &lt;b&gt;would&lt;/b&gt; you like to see? What does something big enough look like? What do you think is missing here?

I see this as &lt;b&gt;the big opportunity&lt;/b&gt; to effect change. And the only means that has a chance of working in time to prevent too much catastrophe.

One of the great ironies of the push to globalize the world economy, open all the markets, and corporatize the power structures of the world made by the large companies is that they have made themselves far more vulnerable to mass consumer action. The financial world has moved to a very fluid and extremely short-term outlook. Companies rise and fall in years, not decades. A few bad quarters can spell the death knell and evaporate $ billions in market capitalization for individual companies.

Since I have a background as a trader, I&#039;ve certainly thought of ways to bring economic and investor pressure to bear on companies to get them to act better as global citizens. Corporations are inherently amoral and absent pressure to act morally, they won&#039;t. 

There is a lot that a motivated group of like-minded individuals could do. One could even create investment funds or foundations that were non-profit and targeted at bringing about this sort of pressure. It could be both very profitable for the endowment of the foundation and very effective at getting corporate change.

I believe it would be much easier for those who care about sustainability to band together to bring this kind of pressure directly against companies than it would be to fight companies in the political arena. Those efforts have failed and will continue to fail, IMHO.

Economic pressure is different, companies need customers far more than consumers need any particular company or product. In the economic arena, coordination could allow for a divide and conquer strategy against even very large companies.

One nice aspect of this kind of pressure is that it is completely voluntary and apolitical. No one proposes that each individual doesn&#039;t have the right to decide what to buy and where to spend their money. This freedom is largely available even in most current dictatorships.

There have been a few &quot;green&quot; initiatives over the last few decades but nothing along the lines of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delano_grape_strike&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the grape boycott of the late 60s&lt;/a&gt;. César Chavez knew how to bring pressure to bear.

The internet is an ideal organizing vehicle for mass consumer action. But it makes real good sense to first understand what changes are most important to make and what problems are most urgent.

I believe that the reason we haven&#039;t seen anything like this yet is because those who are interested have not yet realized the possibilities. There is much that could potentially be done.

I haven&#039;t been paying real close attention so perhaps I&#039;ve missed something. Does anyone know of groups who are organizing to put economic pressure on companies to act more sustainably as a significant part of their strategy?]]></description>

One could even create investment funds or foundations that were non-profit and targeted at bringing about this sort of pressure. It could be both very profitable for the endowment of the foundation and very effective at getting corporate change.</p>
<p>I believe it would be much easier for those who care about sustainability to band together to bring this kind of pressure directly against companies than it would be to fight companies in the political arena. Those efforts have failed and will continue to fail, IMHO.</p>
<p>Economic pressure is different, companies need customers far more than consumers need any particular company or product. In the economic arena, coordination could allow for a divide and conquer strategy against even very large companies.</p>
<p>One nice aspect of this kind of pressure is that it is completely voluntary and apolitical. No one proposes that each individual doesn&#8217;t have the right to decide what to buy and where to spend their money. This freedom is largely available even in most current dictatorships.</p>
<p>There have been a few &#8220;green&#8221; initiatives over the last few decades but nothing along the lines of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delano_grape_strike" rel="nofollow">the grape boycott of the late 60s</a>. César Chavez knew how to bring pressure to bear.</p>
<p>The internet is an ideal organizing vehicle for mass consumer action. But it makes real good sense to first understand what changes are most important to make and what problems are most urgent.</p>
<p>I believe that the reason we haven&#8217;t seen anything like this yet is because those who are interested have not yet realized the possibilities. There is much that could potentially be done.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t been paying real close attention so perhaps I&#8217;ve missed something. Does anyone know of groups who are organizing to put economic pressure on companies to act more sustainably as a significant part of their strategy?</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Certainly what we&#039;re seeing from the youth movements in the Arab world today at the very least shows that politics can change. Unexpected constituencies can emerge and gain their voices.  All the major political events of history, really, were quite &quot;unexpected&quot; eruptions of that sort, weren&#039;t they?

That finding of mine, that ~80% of the energy uses that businesses rely on to operate are individually untraceable,... points to a kind of paradigm shift in environmental impact measurement, for example.   That &quot;dark energy&quot; used by businesses is hidden because it&#039;s what the self-managing parts of business do, the direct business cost of the &quot;know-how&quot; they provide... without leaving receipts to trace it.   

It does in fact point to a fivefold increase in the known environmental impacts of business revenues, and growth, and so also of the growing payments for environmental services.

That finding, once appreciated, will change the game, and is being accepted by people who read the paper. What is unclear to people is what it means to include the physical accounts of self-managing services (that businesses pay for) with the physical accounts of businesses too.  What it means is that the economists have been counting that ~80% of the financial costs of business operations but ignoring the same ~80% of the physical costs...

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It&#039;s worth noting that loudly expressed consumer preferences already can push companies towards environmentally sounder policies.  So far, however, it&#039;s happening in ways that are a lot smaller than I&#039;d like.  

An amusingly complicated case concerns &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.umich.edu/~nppcpub/resources/compendia/CORPpdfs/CORPcaseB1.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;McDonald&#039;s clamshell controversy&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Debate over McDonald’s packaging materials started in the 1970s when the public became concerned that too many trees were being cut down to make packaging. In response to this interest, Ray Kroc, McDonald’s founder, commissioned the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) to conduct an environmental impact study comparing the paperboard packaging McDonald’s was then using to polystyrene packaging. By analyzing all aspects of the two alternatives from manufacturing though disposal, SRI concluded that plastic was preferred. They reasoned that the coating on the paperboard made it nearly impossible to recycle, while polystyrene was recyclable and
used less energy in production.

As a result, McDonald’s switched to polystyrene for their cups and sandwich containers, and launched an environmental education program to communicate to the public their rationale for the switch from paperboard to plastic. In 1989, McDonald’s piloted a recycling program in 450 of their New England restaurants by asking in-store customers to sort their trash into designated trash bins. The polystyrene was then shipped to one to eight plastic recycling plants formed in a joint venture of eight plastics companies. The program gained enough success that soon it was expanded to California and Oregon at the request of state officials, and involved a total of 1,000 stores. McDonald’s began planning a national expansion of the program. However, Environmental Defense Fund Director Fred Krupp told Ed Rensi, Chief Operating Officer and President of McDonald’s USA, that he would publicly refuse to endorse the recycling program, because he did not regard it as the best environmental solution.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And so on...  Let&#039;s pick up the story &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.packaging2.com/PDF/Packaging_World.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

For many years, crew members made McDonald’s multi-layer sandwiches right in polystyrene clamshells, closed the tops, and delivered the packages to customers. In 1991, the corporation phased out the polystyrene clamshells and adopted a poly-wax coated wrap with an SBS collar of virgin fiber. McDonald’s found that the wrap and collar were simply not as efficient for crew members making sandwiches. A new generation clamshell was needed.

Going beyond the easy or obvious, an SBS clamshell, for example, the packaging team at Perseco/Havi began investigating a slightly more expensive option—a microflute corrugated design. This option offered a number of environmental advantages. The micro-flute clamshell weighed approximately 40 percent less than a comparable SBS package, and it had a significant percentage of post-consumer fiber. Both the lower weight and recycled-fiber content would reduce the pack’s impact on the waste stream. Less bleached fiber minimized dioxins produced during manufacture. McDonald’s supply chain partner, Burrows Paper, used its expertise in corrugated board processing to replace the low-density polypropylene binding agent with renewable and biodegradable cornstarch. The package also featured a renewable soy-based ink. McDonald’s launched its newly designed micro-flute clamshell in 1993.

Fast forward 13 years. Today’s environmental focus now includes a wider appreciation of the sustainability benefits of this package. “In the manufacturing process, waste from clamshells is entirely recycled,” says Bill Burrows, CEO Burrows Paper Corporation. “A third of it goes into an insulation material, while two-thirds is repulped and returned into a new form of paper. “Significantly less water is used in the manufacturing process for the three grades of paper that go into the micro-flute package versus SBS. We are extremely proud of the fact that the energy consumed in manufacturing the clamshell is matched 100 percent with renewable energy resources from such sources as biomass and hydro.”

McCracken added that the post-consumer content in the McDonald’s clamshell has increased over the years to a minimum of 46 percent today. Recycled content saved the equivalent of 2,200 tons of virgin fiber, based on 2003 sales figures, compared with the wrap/collar package. McCracken says, “The success of this packaging effort was truly improved by supplier collaboration.”

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

All this work... for not terribly much!  Now imagine trying to make McDonald&#039;s go carbon-neutral.  

(Developing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.epa.gov/rlep/faq.html#1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;cows that burp less&lt;/a&gt; would be a start, but nowhere near enough.)

On the other hand, Unilever claims to have a plan to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sustainable-living.unilever.com/the-plan/greenhouse-gases/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;halve their carbon emissions by 2020&lt;/a&gt;.  Do they really mean it?  Can it work?]]></description>
