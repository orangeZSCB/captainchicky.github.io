It&#039;s finite alright, this follows from the last slide before the summary, there is a finite volume for the sphere of the considered Hilbert space.]]></description>

John already tried to explain to me that all people interested in quantum information consider finite Hilbert spaces only, but I am still puzzled by David Poulin&#039;s talk: He does not mention any restriction about the dimension of the Hilbert space that his Hamiltonians act on, and he even mentions the standard model as an example of the &quot;kind of system&quot; he considers, so I&#039;ll make a fool of myself again by asking: Is this talk about finite Hilbert spaces or about infinite ones?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In cross-referencing the results that David Poulin presented on the first day of QIP 2011, relating to what Poulin, Qarry, Somma and Verstraete call &quot;the convenient illusion of Hilbert space&quot;, there are natural links to two recent works by  Johnson, Biamonte, Clark, and Jaksch, namely &lt;i&gt;Dynamical simulations of classical stochastic systems using matrix product states&lt;/i&gt; (arXiv:1006.2639) and  &lt;i&gt;Categorical Tensor Network States&lt;/i&gt; (arXiv:1012.0531).

It is enjoyably enlightening to contemplate what amounts to the same physical ideas presented alternatively in the language of traditional quantum mechanics, computer science, linear algebra, information theory, Lindbladian dynamical flow, and now, category theory.

I discuss these emerging links further on &lt;a href=&quot;http://dabacon.org/pontiff/?p=4713#comment-418377&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Dave Bacon&#039;s &lt;i&gt;Quantum Pontiff&lt;/i&gt; weblog&lt;/a&gt; ... it would be great fun if some category theorist would weigh in on this.]]></description>

I was trying to needle people in quantum information who regard Popescu-Rohrlich boxes as &#039;too powerful to be plausible&#039;, while not feeling the same about quantum computers, which while less powerful, could still accomplish rather shocking feats.  Of course the big difference is that we have vast amounts of experimental evidence for quantum mechanics, but nary a shred of evidence for Popescu-Rohrlich boxes.  

If someone told me they could search a phone book with a million phone numbers, and find the person with a given phone number in only a thousand steps, I might not call them &#039;godlike&#039;, but I&#039;d still be quite impressed.

(Here, for the sake of a good story, I&#039;m ignoring the constant factor in $latex O(n^{1/2})$, despite John F&#039;s wise warning.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Of course the scaling is the big improvement for quantum computation, Grover&#039;s algorithm being the prime example, but what about the prefactors, the coefficients which depend upon actual implementation? Remember Landauer&#039;s complaint that implementations were not properly modeled. You may have heard about &quot;hug a tree&quot;.
http://www.nasar.org/nasar/history_hug_a_tree.php

The &quot;hug a tree&quot; concept is maybe easier to compute in the &quot;find your wife in the shopping mall&quot; scenario. In that case, if she remains in one store while you search for her the prefactor is half what it would be than if she wanders from store to store. The assumption is that you search one store after another.

Anyway it is certainly possible to perform implementations that don&#039;t scale &quot;properly&quot;, although these are usually &quot;stupid&quot; implementations. One example would be for you to have a safe point, say the mall entrance, that you return to frantically time after time, checking every store you pass by repeatedly.

The first simulated Grover&#039;s algorithm I wrote had stupid scaling, exactly linear. After smacking my head and rewriting the obvious errors, it still didn&#039;t scale near square root, closer with larger numbers but still. And that&#039;s just code.

There may be issues with physical implementation that mar the pretty scaling theory.]]></description>
