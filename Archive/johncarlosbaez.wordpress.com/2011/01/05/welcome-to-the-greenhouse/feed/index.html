					<description><![CDATA[It occurs to me that I have an immediate need for mathematical expertise that would be highly useful in the field of economics this year.  It&#039;s not quite as grand as inventing a QM-like mathematics for the behavior of learning systems driven to their limits as I suggested earlier.

Elementary arithmetic will tell you that if you divide a pumpkin pie in equal slices that it will have near average amounts of every ingredient in each slice.  This is about to become a major issue of economics.  The economists have been counting the energy used in making each slice as only ~1/5 the average... no lie.

The reason is that an ancient accounting technique was adopted for measuring how much energy use any business is responsible for, just counting up the receipts, essentially, and then asking the businesses they bought things from to count up their receipts too.   That does give you the traceable energy uses the business has.  It does not &quot;divide up the whole pie&quot; of energy uses, though, but just finds some threads.   

I&#039;m publishing a paper called &quot;Systems 
Energy Assessment&quot;, providing a way to define the total energy use of a business as a whole system, using that pie-slice method for things I can&#039;t trace...  It shows rather conclusively that the total of traceable and untraceable energy uses a business has, if its services take about average energy per dollar to be delivered, will make use of ~5 times the traceable energy, and have ~5 times the carbon and other distributed impacts too.   

So the math I need is an elegant way to define the parameters for the distribution of that kind of economic &quot;dark energy&quot; (you might call it, as energy uses a business has no information about).  There&#039;s no mystery where it is being consumed, really, just in all the energy uses it has to pay for that it doesn&#039;t receive detailed receipts for...  That includes paying for employees, legal services, management, finance, taxes, etc, etc., all of which provide essential services that don&#039;t come without the people providing them consuming substantial amounts of energy.

The statistical interest is that all money is paid to people, actually, for rights or work, and if all people have similarly diverse high and low energy using consumption habits, then virtually every dollar of business expenses will end up being &quot;about average&quot;. That would make the distribution of energy intensities per dollar worldwide &quot;very flat&quot;.   I can think much of it through conceptually, but sure could use some help defining it statistically.  

the paper is http://www.synapse9.com/pub/SEA_EROIwind.pdf fyi]]></description>

I didn&#039;t check what Andy Revkin was doing yesterday, and it seems he&#039;s picked up one of the themes I&#039;ve been harping on for years, that this system wide price escalation is not likely to go away.  Why I first decided that was that it represents just the kind of thing I look for as evidence of the economic system exceeding its behavioral limits, behavior it theoretically can&#039;t have.  

The problem... is it kind of violates the general principle that increasing price results in increasing supply...  If that&#039;s not working, and over the long term it seems, that&#039;s really really bad.   

It seems to say that systemically, even if you can&#039;t explain it at first, the increasing difficulty of obtaining resources has come to dominate the supply of resources.  It implies that due to interconnected price rises occurring for natural causes, we have reached &quot;peak everything&quot;.  One of the Brookings papers I quoted in my study of it called &quot;Profiting from Scarcity&quot; described some of the interconnections between peak oil having been achieved in those terms and the food crisis in particular.  fyi - http://www.synapse9.com/pub/ProfitingInScarcity.pdf

Those curious can also ask more about why in the world a global economy would act as a whole in such an interconnected way to reach the practical limits of use for all its basic resources at once.  It&#039;s only natural for a liquid market system scouring the whole world for stuff to use is the simple answer....]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well for one, I think I have a much clearer vision of the challenges and trade-offs we will face in this century. 

I sort of knew those problems and challenges on an abstract, mental level, but I guess that never really seep through lower levels of consciousness, because when I used to think about how the world would be in 2030, 2050, or 2070 i always had these unconscious semi-sci-fi visions of a better place in which science and technology had allowed for a many problems to be solved and for many people to be much better off.

Now i don&#039;t have those visions anymore, except perhaps as a part of a bigger picture, and i regard my former way of looking at the future as a bit disingenuous.

Hope that gives the idea.

(Anyway, I am still hopeful for the centuries following this current one :)]]></description>

This is the best place, i think, to quote Paul Krugman in one of today&#039;s post:

http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/11/immaterial-growth/

&quot;the point is that real GDP isn’t necessarily about tons or BTUs, and it can keep rising, even the way we currently do the accounting, in a world of limited natural resources&quot;

This resonates well with one of your previous comments about going towards an information and knowledge economy.]]></description>

Okay, I&#039;ll consider adding it.  How has your perception changed?  Even if it&#039;s &quot;just&quot; an emotional thing, I&#039;m curious.  

(In fact, emotions could be the most important factor in how people orient themselves toward issues like global warming, peak oil, etc.)]]></description>

There is a very pertinent discussion about these subjects at the dot earth blog:

http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/10/beyond-the-eternal-food-fight/

By the way, John, you might consider adding a link to this blog on the right hand side links, if you like it (personally after playing that game i have decided to follow that blog a little more closely, since my perception of the things to come has changed a little, at the emotional level more than the rational one).]]></description>

John, I appreciate and have actually long understood that.  It&#039;s indeed not possible to speak to people except in a language they understand, generally their own, or else they don&#039;t hear you...

What I found over the years, though, is that the only thing otherwise quite smart people will listen to is  when you&#039;ve exhausted your patience speaking about things a little beyond their language.  Everyone is able to respond to is someone else&#039;s natural sense of frustration it seems.  

I don&#039;t know how to do the math, really, but you might. What I was suggesting in my comment yesterday on your interest in real world problems for Mathematical Economics [https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/01/08/mathematical-economics/#comment-3438] is a form of modeling for economic systems somewhat like QM.  

The difference from QM for studying the boundary conditions for large &quot;observation, interpretation &#038; response&quot; networks (that economies are built around) would in the modeling of the &quot;mysterious hidden process&quot; connecting the &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; states.  For learning machines that process would have variable non-zero duration as well as uncertainty, in this case for altogether human reasons.  That would let you explore some of the natural limitations of using such a system to run a planet.  These kinds of structures proliferate in economies and other natural systems that exhibit rapid organizational development processes, so the work would be both innovative and possibly quite valuable.

I also posted the earlier comment with the graphic and above suggestion on my blog as comments on how to study the limits of learning, http://synapse9.com/blog/2011/01/09/the-limits-of-learning-machines-drawing-a-blank/  fyi]]></description>

Thanks a lot for the great description!  

It would definitely be much better if this game, or some game like it, were open-source.  If the people selling this game are trying to help save the planet, they should make an open-source version &#8212; perhaps without the pretty graphics and other inessential features that make most people want to buy the game.  

I almost always resist playing games, but I&#039;m tempted by this one.  If I play it, it&#039;ll be the first time I&#039;ve played a game since my brief fling with Go.]]></description>

My gripe with physics is partly, of course, because as a physicist I’ve had a bunch of wonderfully interesting things to talk about for decades and have just been treated dismissively everywhere I went.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I agree with almost everything you&#039;re saying, but I do have one piece of advice:

When I&#039;m trying to convince a certain group of people to get interested in some ideas, it &lt;i&gt;never ever&lt;/i&gt; helps to complain about them.

Complaining about a group of people &#8212; physicists, mathematicians, Americans, Chinese, Republicans, Democrats, or any group whatsoever &#8212; always brings out their &#039;tribe mentality&#039;, otherwise known as &#039;patriotism&#039;.  They instantly focus on defending their tribe, and stop paying attention to what one is saying.   

If I desperately feel the need to complain about some people and how slow they are to appreciate my wonderful ideas, I talk to my wife.  She thinks I&#039;m great, so she usually agrees with me (or at least pretends to, very convincingly) &#8212; and I instantly feel much better.

When I&#039;m talking to a group of people, trying to convince them of some idea, I find it vastly more productive to flatter them, saying roughly: &quot;You folks have the special abilities and tools needed to appreciate these ideas.&quot;  

Saying this over and over, with unrealistic optimism in the face of massive evidence to the contrary, can work wonders over time.  

The key is to figure out ways to to appeal to the tribe mentality instead of fighting it.  When I&#039;m really desperate, I sometimes pull out a powerful secret weapon.  I say:  &quot;You folks have the special abilities and tools needed to appreciate these ideas... &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;which those other folks over there lack!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&quot;  

That &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; gets them going.  Every profession has its neighboring rival professions.  More generally, every tribe has its neighboring rival tribes. Every tribe is looking for ways to gain a competitive advantage over its neighbors.

So when I tell physicists, for example, that they&#039;re better than mathematicians at appreciating the connection between topological quantum field theory and n-categories, because physicists know about path integrals, they believe me &#8212; especially because it was true!  And they like it!  And that&#039;s a good way to get physicists to like n-categories.

But this strategy of exploiting competition between neighboring tribes is risky, and I don&#039;t really recommend it.  First of all, the other tribe might be listening.  Second of all, it&#039;s probably better overall to reduce competition between tribes, rather than enhance it.  

But one can at least avoid certain uphill battles, by resisting the temptation to complain about a tribe when its members are listening.]]></description>
