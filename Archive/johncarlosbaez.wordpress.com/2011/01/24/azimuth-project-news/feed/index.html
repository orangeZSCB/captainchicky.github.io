It&#039;s worth noting that there have been various examples of species being introduced to previously &quot;isolated&quot; areas. Under non-climate change conditions, it appears that the effect on native ecosystem species can be much larger than one would expect, eg, simply the introduction of rabbits into Australia &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbits_in_Australia#Effects_on_Australia.27s_ecology&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;is claimed to be the biggest cause of species loss&lt;/a&gt;, although no source is cited.

So one question is: does species moving in response to climate change (but without a hard barrier previously having been in place) have a similar effect to these observable past cases?

I certainly wouldn&#039;t say a 30 percent speices loss is something that&#039;s &quot;plain absurd&quot;, although it certainly needs more detailed support and calculation to justify it.]]></description>

Nathan, It&#039;s hard to be inclusive with a list like this, but there are a couple more I can think of.  

As the oceans rise and the coastlines and coastal human occupation is inundated, many species will be able to move and won&#039;t be bothered at all.  Some whole ecologies would probably be disrupted, though, like estuary ecologies that no longer have ancient marshland to occupy, for example.  One example would be loosing all of Florida, the remains of ancient coral reefs itself, would be all but completely lost, along with all it&#039;s dozens of unique ecologies.

The other one I was thinking of was the emergence of &quot;crustacean free zones&quot; (my name for them).  Acidification is being projected to get to levels in some open ocean areas such that shell formation would be greatly or completely inhibited in, I believe about 40 years.    By that time the well known oxygen free &quot;dead zones&quot; might greatly expand too, as a byproduct of rising population, food production and temperature...

Both cases are examples of species extinction from habitat loss, and human activity is consuming ecological habitat at a furious pace it seems.  So that might be proxy measure for species loss, just the  simple quantitative loss of habitat as a % of the total.]]></description>

The previous comment was long, so let me put this in a new comment:  where do these species extinction predictions come from?  Some of them are summarized in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ipcc-wg2.gov/AR4/website/04.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;IPCC AR4 WG2 report&lt;/a&gt;, Section 4.4.11.  I don&#039;t have time to read through this, so I don&#039;t really know how they get these estimates.

I spot-checked a few papers, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://stephenschneider.stanford.edu/Publications/PDF_Papers/ThomasEtAl2004.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Thomas et al. (2004)&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v427/n6970/extref/nature02121-s1.doc&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;SI&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00364.x/full&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Malcolm et al. (2006)&lt;/a&gt;.

The Thomas et al. paper is simpler (and highly cited), so I&#039;ll start there.  Apparently their conclusion is based on an empirically determined scaling relation between the area of a &quot;climate envelope&quot; and the number of species in it.  Specifically, they assume that the number of species scales as the fourth root of area, but explore sensitivity to other power laws.  (They also explore sensitivity to different dispersal behaviors, climate changes, etc.)  The species-area law is assumed to apply globally with the same exponent, and they ignore geographic barriers.

This is a pretty simplistic relationship, and I don&#039;t know how far to trust it, especially in large extrapolations.  Also, I&#039;m puzzled:  if you want to get a 30% decrease in species from this law, I guess you&#039;d need a 4x decrease in climate envelope area on average?  (Ok, it&#039;s nonlinear, but whatever.)   Will the average size of all climate envelopes shrink by that much?  Surely some will shrink and some will grow; what&#039;s the net effect?  I don&#039;t quite understand what a &quot;climate envelope&quot; is in the first place.  In the paper I can&#039;t find raw numbers for how the areas are predicted change; I can only find the implied extinctions.  Not sure where to find the database they used.

Apparently this paper has been criticized a lot (see the comments on it, for example), so I&#039;m not sure if I picked the best or most representative example to start with!  It is cited a lot, though.

The Malcolm et al. paper also uses species-area relationships, but appears to do more detailed spatial modeling.  At this point I&#039;ve spent enough time, but maybe someone else would like to pick up and analyze these papers, or find better ones.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/01/24/azimuth-project-news/#comment-3916&quot;&gt;Arrow&lt;/a&gt;.

Speaking as someone who tries to put probabilities on predictions, I disagree that we need to be able to put exact probabilities on predictions for them to be worthwhile!  Even an order of magnitude probability bound could be useful.  (Is it less than 10%?  Less than 1%?)  We do need to have some understanding of what the range of plausible outcomes may be, if not exact probabilities.  However, I disagree that an estimate without probabilities is &quot;unscientific&quot;. 

Your first point itself seems &quot;unscientific&quot; to me:  you&#039;re going to dismiss a finding because &quot;you can find many scientists who support almost any belief you want&quot;?  Come on.  Give a real reason to disagree with their findings.

That said, I am skeptical myself of how such mass extinction numbers are obtained.  It seems very difficult to extrapolate ecological dynamics compared to, say, global average temperature.  But I&#039;m not going to call such predictions &quot;unscientific&quot;, certainly not without first understanding how they are arrived at.

And arguments of the form &quot;global warming is small compared to the diurnal temperature cycle therefore it has negligible ecological impacts&quot;, or &quot;species can simply move&quot;, seem extraordinarily naive to me.  I know virtually nothing about ecology, but it&#039;s not hard to think of ways those arguments could fail.  For example:

1. Direct climate change. Some species really do live near the upper end of their temperature range.  An average warming of a few C could wipe them out.

2. Extremes. It&#039;s not just higher average temperatures, but extremes that can cause wide dieoffs.  More heat waves, droughts, flash floods, etc.  This is one of the great stressors on corals, for example.

3. Competition.  Warming doesn&#039;t have to push species past their maximum physiologically compatible temperature in order to drive them to extinction.  It just has to make them less efficient competitors other species, either in their existing location or in a niche they&#039;ll try to migrate into.

4. Barriers.  There are many geographical barriers to migration.  The NYT article mentions an obvious barrier for mountainous species:  eventually, they can&#039;t move farther up the mountain.  Many non-mountainous species can&#039;t cross mountain ranges.  Or there might be a desert in the way.  Or maybe the soil is too poor/different for that species to grow.  There can be geographic bottlenecks:  imagine tons of species leaving South America and all trying to cram through the Isthmus of Panama.  Humans can create barriers to migration, by building cities, roads, farms, houses, etc.

5. Climatic inhomogeneity. Climatic variables don&#039;t all change in the same way.  You seem to envision every species moving in lockstep X kilometers poleward, and resettling in perfect latitudinal translation.  But suppose that the temperature envelope where a species needs to live moves poleward by X kilometers, but the precipitation envelope moves Y kilometers, and they don&#039;t overlap.

6. Migration inhomogeneity.  From this it follows that ecosystem migrations may not be uniform.  Suppose a species needs to move X kilometers, but another species it depends on needs to move Y kilometers, and they no longer overlap geographically.  Or they both need to move the same amount, but they migrate at different rates or in different directions, and don&#039;t overlap.

7. Key species and interdependency.  Knock out a few species that a lot of other species depend on, and other species may follow, even if they&#039;re not harmed directly by climate change.

8. Invasion.  The bark beetle infestation in the American West is an example.  Warming allows them to survive the winter and breed, allowing them to expand into vast new stretches of territory and attack trees.

9. Existing stressors.  The extinction rate is already elevated by other human activity (land use change, overexploitation, pollution, the aforementioned geographic migration barriers, etc.)  That could make species more sensitive to extinction (by climate change or other factors) than they otherwise would be.

10. Biodiversity hotspots.  Supposedly 20% of plant species live on 0.5% of the Earth&#039;s land surface; 1.4% of the land surface contain 44% of plant species and 35% of terrestrial vertebrates.  (See the next comment for citations; I presume this applies to &quot;known&quot; species.)  Climate change in such a region could have a disproportionate effect on extinctions.

Maybe there are also other reasons to think that climate change might have little impact on ecosystems, but the reasons you gave don&#039;t appear particularly well grounded in any form of ecological science.  Indeed, they seem like totally unsupported assumptions, rather than scientific conclusions.

In general, I might expect perturbations to lead to extinctions, on the grounds that most species are probably living near local fitness optima, and so perturbations would tend to decrease local fitness until the system reorganizes itself.  But that&#039;s a fuzzy, non-quantitative argument, and the quantitative details will depend on how much, how fast, where, and what&#039;s living there.]]></description>

Many non-mountainous species can&#8217;t cross mountain ranges.  Or there might be a desert in the way.  Or maybe the soil is too poor/different for that species to grow.  There can be geographic bottlenecks:  imagine tons of species leaving South America and all trying to cram through the Isthmus of Panama.  Humans can create barriers to migration, by building cities, roads, farms, houses, etc.</p>
<p>5. Climatic inhomogeneity. Climatic variables don&#8217;t all change in the same way.  You seem to envision every species moving in lockstep X kilometers poleward, and resettling in perfect latitudinal translation.  But suppose that the temperature envelope where a species needs to live moves poleward by X kilometers, but the precipitation envelope moves Y kilometers, and they don&#8217;t overlap.</p>
<p>6. Migration inhomogeneity.  From this it follows that ecosystem migrations may not be uniform.  Suppose a species needs to move X kilometers, but another species it depends on needs to move Y kilometers, and they no longer overlap geographically.  Or they both need to move the same amount, but they migrate at different rates or in different directions, and don&#8217;t overlap.</p>
<p>7. Key species and interdependency.  Knock out a few species that a lot of other species depend on, and other species may follow, even if they&#8217;re not harmed directly by climate change.</p>
<p>8. Invasion.  The bark beetle infestation in the American West is an example.  Warming allows them to survive the winter and breed, allowing them to expand into vast new stretches of territory and attack trees.</p>
<p>9. Existing stressors.  The extinction rate is already elevated by other human activity (land use change, overexploitation, pollution, the aforementioned geographic migration barriers, etc.)  That could make species more sensitive to extinction (by climate change or other factors) than they otherwise would be.</p>
<p>10. Biodiversity hotspots.  Supposedly 20% of plant species live on 0.5% of the Earth&#8217;s land surface; 1.4% of the land surface contain 44% of plant species and 35% of terrestrial vertebrates.  (See the next comment for citations; I presume this applies to &#8220;known&#8221; species.)  Climate change in such a region could have a disproportionate effect on extinctions.</p>
<p>Maybe there are also other reasons to think that climate change might have little impact on ecosystems, but the reasons you gave don&#8217;t appear particularly well grounded in any form of ecological science.  Indeed, they seem like totally unsupported assumptions, rather than scientific conclusions.</p>
<p>In general, I might expect perturbations to lead to extinctions, on the grounds that most species are probably living near local fitness optima, and so perturbations would tend to decrease local fitness until the system reorganizes itself.  But that&#8217;s a fuzzy, non-quantitative argument, and the quantitative details will depend on how much, how fast, where, and what&#8217;s living there.</p>

Your objections are precisely the reason why the Azimuth project exists, over there we try to find information and investigate what  would back up or disprove claims like the one you cite.
As you can see for yourself, mainstream media cannot and will not provide the kind of scientific background information that is necessary to make informed decisions.

P.S.: Cursing is not allowed on this blog.]]></description>

Your experiments sound interesting, but since I&#039;m not a chemist I can&#039;t judge their merits, much less coax a colleague to do them, or do them myself.  

Can anyone out there make some useful suggestions?]]></description>

Thanks to whoever took out my hard line ends. I was posting from a library terminal where I am kicked off after one hour, and my hour was almost up.

I described the experiments I want done as &quot;pedestrian&quot;. Another way to express this is &quot;on the ground&quot;, seeking ground truth. The talk involving Curtis Faith would seem to be about seeking ground truth, seeking &lt;em&gt;reality&lt;/em&gt;, I think it said. Do they count?]]></description>
