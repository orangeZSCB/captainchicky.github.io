Let&#039;s hope that this materialises. However, it&#039;s important to remember that default practice in biofuels seems to be &quot;announce early and announce incredibly overoptimisitcally&quot;: most biofuels startups shut down before they&#039;ve even produced fuel from a non-laboratory scale plant, let alone actually at the price they&#039;ve publicised, as described in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.consumerenergyreport.com/2011/01/27/vinod-khosla-and-the-gasificationfermentation-debate/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this post here&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>

I think that this from Harwell/Rutherford Lab.
These are good scientists. If this is really true, it&#039;s a game changer!]]></description>

John, Yes indeed, for sequestration that &quot;There are also economies and diseconomies of scale to consider.&quot; is particularly relevant.  It just gives you a way to establish a true market price point at present.  It gives you the cost of sequestering the carbon for the average $1 of GDP, by the present cheapest standard method.  If you were to spend $.15 per $1 globally, that would be 15% of GDP!!!  

The idea isn&#039;t really to propose a solution directly, but to propose a more meaningful problem.  If, as the author of the study intended, you want to set a realistic price for carbon sequestration, it&#039;s better to start from an established market price for a real service, rather than just make one up based on judging what would be a &quot;bearable cost&quot; determined politically.  

That hardly anyone is even suspecting that this might have game changing economic consequences is just a bonus.]]></description>

John F, methinks we don&#039;t fully agree:

You haven&#039;t yet shown me a paper that says that biochar/charcoal (not soot or pyrolysis oils etc.) would degrade within decades.

E.g. Amazonian terra preta is centuries (up to 2000y) old fertile human made soil that still contains comparably large amounts of char.

But I&#039;m with you in finding it worthwhile to examine the proportion of the faster (decades) degrading stuff in charcoal. That sure depends much on the char production process (temperature, residual oxygen), the feedstock and on the soil where it is worked in. E.g. resin rich wood (like fir) produces different char coal than hardwood (like beech). This is all quite difficult to quantify, and it looks soil science is just at the beginning here.

Quantifying degradation gets even more difficult because of synergistic effects with soil life. The paradigmatic enigma is the apparent ability of terra preta to grow and sequester more carbon.

E.g. arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi produce glomalin that stabilizes soil - and these fungi seem to love porous char coal.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Little is known of the role plant species play in influencing accumulation of the fungal protein glomalin, even though it is composed of photosynthetically fixed carbon transferred directly to the fungi. Physical protection of soil structure by glomalin leads to soil aggregate stabilization. Aggregate stabilization in turn sequesters plant organic matter (OM) in recalcitrant pools and result in net OM storage in the soil.&lt;/blockquote&gt;(From abstract &lt;a href=&quot;http://abstracts.co.allenpress.com/pweb/esa2005/document/51590&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) 

This is just one synergistic effect.

Alas I&#039;ve started to compare my &quot;super char coal soil&quot; (50% char, against conventional wisdom) with conventional garden soil only late last summer. It turned out superior - but it looks the main reason is that it holds more water.]]></description>

I think we agree to an extent. My point being that it, whatever form of black carbon, soot, char, coal, it degrades eventually. Bury it deep enough, or anaerobically, and it lasts a long time (for instance, there are coal mines ...). But I don&#039;t think we&#039;re talking about refilling old coal mines with char.

If you just mix with topsoil, it is degrading within decades, maybe centuries for chunks. That *is* extremely recalcitrant compared to say aliphatic petroleum, but not in the context of centuries of climate change.]]></description>
