					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/11/24/lynn-margulis-1938-2011/#comment-10849&quot;&gt;Frederik De Roo&lt;/a&gt;.

In case anyone is too lazy to read the interview with Margulis &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.edge.org/documents/ThirdCulture/n-Ch.7.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, I&#039;ll quote a bit about the Gaia Hypothesis:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Why did every scientist I asked believe that atmospheric oxygen was a biological product but the other atmospheric gases — nitrogen, methane, sulfur, and so on — were not? &quot;Go talk to Lovelock,&quot; at least four different scientists suggested. Lovelock believed that the gases in the atmosphere were biological. He had, by this time, a very good idea of which live organisms were probably &quot;breathing out&quot; the gases in question. These gases were far too abundant in the atmosphere to be formed by chemical and physical processes alone. He argued that the atmosphere was a physiological and not just a chemical system.

The Gaia hypothesis states that the temperature of the planet, the oxidation state and other chemistry of all of the gases of the lower atmosphere (except helium, argon, and other nonreactive ones) are produced and maintained by the sum of life. We explored how this could be. How could the temperature of the planet be regulated by living beings? How could the atmospheric gas composition — the 20-percent oxygen and the one to two parts per million methane, for example — be actively maintained by living matter?

It took me days of conversation even to begin to understand Lovelock&#039;s thinking. My first response, just like that of the neo-Darwinists, was &quot;business as usual.&quot; I would say, &quot;Oh, you mean that organisms adapt to their environment.&quot; He would respond, very sweetly, &quot;No, I don&#039;t mean that.&quot; Lovelock kept telling me what he really meant, and it was hard for me to listen. Since his was a new idea, he hadn&#039;t yet developed an appropriate vocabulary. Perhaps I helped him work out his explanations, but I did very little else.

The Gaia hypothesis is a biological idea, but it&#039;s not human-centered. Those who want Gaia to be an Earth goddess for a cuddly, furry human environment find no solace in it. They tend to be critical or to misunderstand. They can buy into the theory only by misinterpreting it. Some critics are worried that the Gaia hypothesis says the environment will respond to any insults done to it and the natural systems will take care of the problems. This, they maintain, gives industries a license to pollute. Yes, Gaia will take care of itself; yes, environmental excesses will be ameliorated, but it&#039;s likely that such restoration of the environment will occur in a world devoid of people.

Lovelock would say that Earth is an organism. I disagree with this phraseology. No organism eats its own waste. I prefer to say that Earth is an ecosystem, one continuous enormous ecosystem composed of many component ecosystems. Lovelock&#039;s position is to let the people believe that Earth is an organism, because if they think it is just a pile of rocks they kick it, ignore it, and mistreat it. If they think Earth is an organism, they&#039;ll tend to treat it with respect. To me, this is a helpful cop-out, not science. Yet I do agree with Lovelock when he claims that most of the things scientists do are not science either. And I realize that by taking the stance he does he is more effective than I am in communicating Gaian ideas.

If science doesn&#039;t fit in with the cultural milieu, people dismiss science, they never reject their cultural milieu! If we are involved in science of which some aspects are not commensurate with the cultural milieu, then we are told that our science is flawed. I suspect that all people have cultural concepts into which science must fit. Although I try to recognize these biases in myself, I&#039;m sure I cannot entirely avoid them. I try to focus on the direct observational aspects of science.

Gaia is a tough bitch — a system that has worked for over three billion years without people. This planet&#039;s surface and its atmosphere and environment will continue to evolve long after people and prejudice are gone.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

I think it&#039;s emotional on her side because many people were slow to accept her theories of evolution via symbiosis, and she felt she had to fight to be taken seriously.  Meanwhile, she looked at the bigshots of evolutionary biology---the people she&#039;s criticizing in the passage I quoted---and saw many of them talking about evolution as if it were: 

1) always the result of slow incremental changes: random mutations and natural selection,

2) nicely understood using the mathematical models of Haldane and Fisher, 

3) best studied using techniques of traditional zoology (and botany), which focus on macroscopic animals (and plants) and largely ignore the other kingdoms of life, which she considers &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; important.

So, she probably felt that many evolutionary biologists were ignoring really new and interesting phenomena that can only be understood by direct observation, and wasting their time polishing beautiful theories based on insufficient data.  As she says: &lt;b&gt;&quot;codifying ignorance&quot;&lt;/b&gt;. 

Of course many people had already doubted parts of 1)-3).   But the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_evolutionary_synthesis&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Modern Synthesis&lt;/a&gt; had solidified into a bit of a dogma by 1967, when her ground-breaking paper came out, so she probably felt rather oppressed, and probably carried a chip on her shoulder ever since.  

By now the situation is much more fluid, as people are struggling to take lots of new observations and fit them together into an &#039;extended synthesis&#039;.   It must be an exciting time for anyone working on evolutionary biology!  I urge everyone to read this book, to catch some of this excitement:

&#8226; Massimo Pigliucci and Gerd B. Müller, editors, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&#038;tid=12173&#038;mode=toc&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Evolution - The Extended Synthesis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 2010.

It will take a while for this new synthesis to come to some sort of resting point, if it ever does.]]></description>

Florifulgurator said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Plus, there’s another notable excrement, coal and oil.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Are they? If I may be sarcastic, perhaps the fact that we currently burn fossil fuels is instead the most efficient method by which Gaia can recycle these otherwise wasteful products and turn them into useful carbon dioxide again which can be eaten by other lifeforms...

But (seriously) thanks for your other comments, which are clarifying to me.]]></description>

I don&#039;t see such a serious difference.

Her reason to take Gaia as &quot;just&quot; one very large ecosystem seems to be that she doesn&#039;t produce waste, and instead does the recycling herself - unlike any other organism. But Gaia &quot;eats&quot; low entropy solar radiation and &quot;excretes&quot; high entropy radiation into space. Plus, there&#039;s another notable excrement, coal and oil. If you don&#039;t identify the whole planet (incl. the inner) with Gaia, but only the surface, then there&#039;s enough room for an organismic view: The waste products being buried away by sedimentation and recycling being done by plate tectonics. 

One reason for the dispute with neo Darwinists she explains with different perspectives: Her focus is on microbial life - which is a different realm than the megafauna typically studied by evolution biologists. (Her world has e.g.  horizontal gene transfer, which has some cooperative flavor. In the realm of animals and plants, genes just compete.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/11/24/lynn-margulis-1938-2011/#comment-10772&quot;&gt;John Baez&lt;/a&gt;.

The big differences between bacterial flagella and the flagella of eukaryotic cells can serve as evidence that the latter didn&#039;t evolve from the former---but only as rather weak evidence that  eukaryotes got their flagella via symbiosis with spirochetes.  (Spirochetes are spiral-shaped bacteria that move by twisting around.)  Why does Margulis think the flagella came from symbiosis?

Lynn Margulis has written at length on this, but unfortunately I forget most of what little I once knew, and I&#039;m feeling too lazy tonight to read her papers.  I only have the energy to read this:

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_flagella&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Evolution of flagella&lt;/a&gt;, Wikipedia. 

Apparently some eukaryotes &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; use symbiotic spirochetes to help move around---namely, some protozoa called parabasalids that live in the guts of termites.  However, the homologies that Margulis proposed between cilia and spirochetes &quot;haven&#039;t stood up to further scrutiny&quot;, according to the doubting masses.  And there&#039;s been work on how flagella could have evolved from the &#039;spindles&#039; that eukaryotic cells use to pull apart their nuclei in the process of reproducing.  ]]></description>

I wonder what kinds of consideration would speak for and against this last controversy. She must have had more in mind than their being &quot;so different in structure, function, and perhaps evolutionary origin&quot;. Mind you, I guess it would have helped thinking this way in separating whales and dolphins from fish. 

Ultimately, must it come down to the genetics of flagellum growth and operation?]]></description>
