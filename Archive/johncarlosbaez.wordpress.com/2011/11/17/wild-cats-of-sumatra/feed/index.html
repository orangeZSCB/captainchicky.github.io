The scary cat don&#039;t need to want to eat you. Once I was friend with a 15y old house cat, sole survivor of the road nearby. She didn&#039;t like the new Husky dog around. So she waited for him in a dark corner and smacked out one of his eyes. (Well, almost - it took elaborate and expensive surgery to save the eye).

My favorite wildcat is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Lynx&lt;/a&gt;. I&#039;ve once lived near a European Lynx breeding station in the Bavarian Forest. They can pretend to be even more lazy than a house cat. The most pretty is perhaps the Iberian Lynx:

The &lt;a href=&quot;http://rareandexoticfelinereg.homestead.com/Featured_Breeds.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Rare &#038; Exotic Feline Registry&lt;/a&gt; lists breed names like American Lynx. But they have no Lynx genes.

One species that has indeed been interbred with domestic cat is the African &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serval&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Serval&lt;/a&gt; (leptailurus serval).

The result is the amazing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tica.org/public/breeds/sv/intro.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Savannah&lt;/a&gt; breed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If anyone knows the other two species of cats that live on Sumatra---the two the WWF failed to photograph---I&#039;d like to hear it!

Borneo is also very close to Singapore.  In my wanderings, I ran into this:

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.news24.com/SciTech/News/Extinct-wild-cat-spotted-in-Borneo-20110113&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&#039;Extinct&#039; wild cat spotted in Borneo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;News 24&lt;/i&gt;, 13 January 2011.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Kuala Lumpur - One of the world&#039;s rarest wild cats, an elusive creature once thought to be extinct, has been spotted in camera traps in Malaysian Borneo for the first time since 2003, researchers have said.

The &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Cat&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Bornean Bay Cat&lt;/a&gt;, a long-tailed reddish or grey feline the size of a large domesticated cat, was sighted in the northern highlands of Malaysia&#039;s Sarawak state, the forest department said on Thursday.

Three photographs showing two or three individuals were captured, bringing new hope for the future of the endangered animal about which very little is known, said research officer Wilhelmina Cluny.

&quot;This species is very secretive... it was classified as extinct until a photograph of it was taken in 2003,&quot; she said.

&quot;I do feel encouraged, this photograph was taken in a logged forest... when we saw this it made us wonder whether this kind of habitat can sustain wildlife, even for rare and important species like the bay cat.&quot;

&quot;We had been looking for any mammals and this bay cat came up, it&#039;s quite exciting that we got the photograph.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/11/17/wild-cats-of-sumatra/#comment-10372&quot;&gt;Allen K.&lt;/a&gt;.

Cool!  If these F4&#039;s do what comes naturally and breed with other cats, it&#039;ll bring scads of new genes into the &lt;i&gt;Felis domesticus&lt;/i&gt; gene pool.  That could be good... 

Anyone know other species of cats that can (perhaps with work like Allen described) interbreed with domestic cats?  

I think a domestic version of the Asian golden cat would look very nice---it&#039;s just about as big as a cat can be without me getting really scared of it. 

&lt;img width=&quot;350&quot; src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Asian_Golden_cat.jpg/570px-Asian_Golden_cat.jpg&quot;/&gt;

But don&#039;t worry, I&#039;m not an idiot: I don&#039;t think that something would be a good pet just because it &lt;i&gt;looks&lt;/i&gt; very nice.  Asian golden cats are very shy, and probably fierce when bothered, so they&#039;d probably make terrible pets.  

Hmm, actually maybe a cat 2 or 3 times the size of a house cat would already scare me.  I don&#039;t think it would try to &lt;i&gt;eat&lt;/i&gt; me, but...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[On making Bengals: the two cats can just barely interbreed -- the male offspring are sterile. So one breeds the half-breed female (an &quot;F1&quot;) with a domestic, and the males are again sterile. So one breeds the quarter-breed female (an &quot;F2&quot;) with a domestic, ... finally the F4s may have males that can breed. We had one that had 7 nipples. Breeders aren&#039;t supposed to sell the F1-F3s.

One time I was looking for him to bathe him (I&#039;m allergic). Where&#039;d he go? Oh, there he is, in the bath already, water up to his neck!]]></description>
