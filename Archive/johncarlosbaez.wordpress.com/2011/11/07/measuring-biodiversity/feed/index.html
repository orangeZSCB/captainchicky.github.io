Jane, yes, I agree.  In her 1975 book &lt;i&gt;Ecological Diversity&lt;/i&gt;,  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sosforests.com/?p=496&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Evelyn Pielou&lt;/a&gt; warned that

&lt;blockquote&gt;

a community&#039;s diversity index is merely a single descriptive statistic, only one of the many needed to summarize its characteristics and, by itself, not very informative.  The belief (or superstition) of some ecologists that a diversity index provides a basis (or talisman) for reaching a full understanding of community structure is totally unfounded.

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/11/07/measuring-biodiversity/#comment-9787&quot;&gt;Matías&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks very much, Matías.  

I know that the question you ask &#8212; the connection between diversity and ecosystem functioning &#8212; has been extensively considered, but I know very little about it.  

Just about the only thing I think I know is that it&#039;s the high values of $latex q$ that are generally considered to be most important for the functioning of whole ecosystems.  The general thought, crudely put, is that common species affect the functioning of an ecosystem more than rare ones.  And high values of $latex q$ pay more attention to common species than low values do.

Take, for example, the traditional or &quot;naive&quot; model in which the similarities between species are ignored.  Then the diversity of order $latex \infty$ is the so-called &lt;b&gt;Berger&#8211;Parker index&lt;/b&gt;.  This is defined as

$latex 1/\max_i p_i$.

In other words, you find the most common species in the community or ecosystem, then calculate the reciprocal of its relative abundance.  

As Berger and Parker pointed out (in a study of plankton sediment on the sea floor), it&#039;s a measure of dominance.  A high Berger&#8211;Parker index means that the most common species isn&#039;t very common: no single species is too dominant.  A low value means that some particular species makes up a large proportion of the population.  For example, a Berger&#8211;Parker index of 1.25 = 5/4 means that 4/5 of your community comes from one particular species.

The Berger&#8211;Parker index is a special case of our measures: it&#039;s $latex {}^\infty D^{\mathbf{I}}$, where $latex \mathbf{I}$ is the identity matrix.  (The similarity matrix is $latex \mathbf{I}$ because we&#039;re using this naive model.)  So it&#039;s an effective number.  This means that it&#039;s measured in units of &lt;i&gt;species&lt;/i&gt;: a Berger&#8211;Parker index of 1.25 means that your community &quot;effectively contains 1.25 species&quot;.]]></description>

Very nice article, also the series at the n-café (which is probably the only one I understand there). Understanding diversity is hugely important giving the rate at which we are destroying it (at least, for many of it&#039;s possible meanings).

The following is primarily a problem for ecologists rather than mathematicians, but which connection are there between ecosystem functioning (and the services it may provide) and the diversity it contains?

I&#039;m perfectly aware that if I want a documented answer (or some collection of them) I should read into the extensive research over this particular question. (And indeed tomorrow I&#039;ll borrow the book &quot;Biodiversity and ecosystem functioning&quot; from my faculty&#039;s library). But maybe some of the writers or readers of this blog have a different background and so novel perspectives particularly to the way biodiversity is proposed to be measured here (for example, with diversity profiles).
I have my own intuitions on the subject but wouldn&#039;t like yet to influence others.

Baez, when you said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;People [...] tend to use numbers where more sophisticated constructs might be better.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Well, looking for those appropriate constructs are my favourite mathematical activity. One I&#039;ve learnt from your posts is the n-cube graph as, for example, a model of the configuration space for an ecological succession.]]></description>

Right.  The column of text gets a bit more skinny with each successive reply to a reply to a reply... and after 3 levels of reply, it becomes absurdly skinny, so the system doesn&#039;t let you reply directly. In that situation you should go back up to the first reply you &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; comment on.  

In fact this what Eric had to do to write the comment you were trying to reply to!  You can see this by looking at the comment &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt; was replying to: it has no blue &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reply&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; thing under it, unlike the comment you just wrote, or the one here.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It may be useful to note that biologists will often reduce their data to a single number (an index, a mean, whatever) without any thought about what is being lost.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Indeed.  People who don&#039;t like math much tend to use numbers where more sophisticated constructs might be better.  These are often the people who think math is about numbers.

Digressing a bit... I read that the dean of admissions at MIT recently said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
To increase gender balance, it’s all a matter of getting the right story out about science and engineering to young women, that it’s not about sitting at a desk doing math all day.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And how do we improve the gender balance in math?  Get the story out that it&#039;s not about sitting a desk doing science and engineering all day?]]></description>
