I wrote a little script to project phosphorous production into the future based on historic data using a Hubbard peak model.  You can get a pretty wide variety of outcomes and the results are sensitive to what you assume the &quot;error&quot; in the data is, since it doesn&#039;t actually follow a pretty Hubbard curve.  More of a fun exercise in curve fitting than something useful, I think.]]></description>

Hey, be careful!  You should have one person driving and another manning the balloon!

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Maybe what David is alluding to is the fact that gravity and acceleration are shown to be equivalent through GR. This means the trivial observation that a balloon floats upwards in our atmosphere, against the force of gravity, implies the less obvious fact that the balloon in our car goes forward when we hit the accelerator.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That&#039;s right!  But your explanation is right too. 

If you see a bubble of air floating up through water in a swimming pool, you can reinterpret it as water falling down: the bubble is a &#039;hole&#039;, just like missing pink dot in this optical illusion.

Similarly, when you hit the accelerator, the air in your car goes crashing to the back of the car, so the &#039;hole&#039;, the balloon, moves forward.]]></description>

My fluids prof told us to drive around with a balloon and gather some empirical evidence on this one... A few near-fender-benders later I think I have a rough idea of how this works. 

The way I think about this problem is that as you press on the brakes (or make a turn, the only important thing is that you are accelerating and hence providing a force) the air tends to pile up in the front of the car, creating a pressure gradient that pushes the less dense balloon to the back of the car.

As for information, here&#039;s a nice article that was cited in a seminar today:

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;//www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art32/”&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Planetary Boundaries: Exploring the Safe Operating Space for Humanity&lt;/a&gt;.

It has an interesting perspective about how the problem with Nitrogen and Phosphorus is not so much a problem of scarcity but rather of unsustainable spilling rate (and so, it&#039;s most straightforward solution would be not so much efficiency as recycling; still both are needed). I still can&#039;t believe we frow so much of them to drinkable water and then to the sea.

(There is a cool summarizing image for all the planetary boundaries analyzed that&#039;s only accesible in the pdf version)

By the way, ashes fom that chilean volcano still drop over the plants in my balcony.]]></description>
