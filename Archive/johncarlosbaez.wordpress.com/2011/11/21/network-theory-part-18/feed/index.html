Okay, that looks great!  Think about some examples.  And think about some counterexamples when the reaction network doesn&#039;t have deficiency zero.  I think it should make intuitive sense after a while.]]></description>

The number of linear conservation laws is the number of species minus the dimension of the stoichiometric subspace.  Even better, the procedure given here for determining the stoichiometric subspace can be used to find all the linear conservation laws.  So, this answers your earlier question about how to find conservation laws.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
So, in deficiency 0 networks the number of connected components is equal to the number of conservation laws. Is this correct?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Let&#039;s see.  The deficiency is the number of complexes minus the number of connected components minus the dimension of the stochiometric subspace.  So, if it&#039;s zero,

&#8226; The number of complexes equals the number of connected components plus the dimension of the stochiometric subspace.

On the other hand, 

&#8226; The number of linear conservation laws is the number of species minus the dimension of the stoichiometric subspace.  

Putting these equations together,  I can get an equation involving the number of connected components and the number of conservation laws.  But it doesn&#039;t seem to be the equation you suggest!  What equation do we actually get?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If s is the number of species, and r the dimensionality of $latex \mathrm{Stoch};$ in the language of linear algebra, $latex \mathrm{Stoch}$ can be identified with the row space. Then as the null space is the orthogonal complement of the row space in $latex \mathbb{R}^s,$ we have s-r independent null space vectors, and therefore s-r linear conservation laws.

Yes, I would like to think about this!  I&#039;ve started with a lot of general formalism concerning chemical reaction networks, and some examples that are fairly dull in the sense that the solutions converge to an equilibrium, but I want to start studying self-organizing systems... as well as expand the &#039;network theory&#039; ideas to cover other subjects.  I&#039;ve done more on the latter, so far.  There&#039;s a lot of stuff already done that I need to explain.  But thanks for pushing me towards the former!]]></description>

John,

Given your interest in leaves over hypercubes (e.g., 1st network th post), perhaps the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction would stimulate some ideas? It is an example of a class of reactions that under certain circumstances, exhibit fundamental self organizing properties (like leaves!).]]></description>
