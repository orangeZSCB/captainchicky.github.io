					<description><![CDATA[Climate sensitivity probably isn&#039;t constant.  It&#039;s often separated into &quot;fast&quot; feedbacks (atmospheric scale) and slower feedbacks (carbon cycle, cryosphere); sometimes the slower feedbacks are omitted from the definition of climate sensitivity.  Depending on the time scale you&#039;re interested in, a constant climate sensitivity may be a reasonable zeroth-order approximation (although it&#039;s somewhat artificial, since it&#039;s the infinite time limit and so in principle should include all timescales).

Your second question is aimed at the state-dependence of climate sensitivity, which I discuss somewhat above and in my interview.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Why should the climate sensitivity be assumed to be a constant?  With all the individual feedback effects kicking at various points I would have assumed a varying sensitivity as more likely.

What does one climate sensitivity measurement of a cold world really imply when it is so removed from today&#039;s climate?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/11/26/climate-sensitivity-paper/#comment-11024&quot;&gt;WebHubTelescope&lt;/a&gt;.

A few remarks on your analysis:

Fat tails of climate sensitivity are most common in analyses using short-term transient data.  They may diminish in paleo studies when transient effects are less important.  However, they can reappear in the guise of forcing uncertainties, especially if you use a linearized model when forcing uncertainty includes zero or negative forcings.  You&#039;ll get a ratio distribution that hits a divide-by-zero.

The Markov chain algorithm is an adaptive Metropolis Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm.  It is not a HMM.

The default prior for the paper is bounded uniform on the range 0.26 to 8.37 K (the range of the ensemble members), as we state on the paper.  We also considered a prior that is bounded uniform in feedback factor instead of ECS (see the SOM).

The thin tails are almost certainly not a result of Monte Carlo sampling.  I also tried the analysis where I evaluated the posterior directly on a 1D grid, without sampling (fixing the error variances so I only had to consider ECS uncertainty).  I got a similar result as the MCMC analysis.]]></description>

Thanks Dr. Urban for the reply,
I posted an analysis of your paper at Judith Curry&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://judithcurry.com/2011/11/29/wht-on-schmittner-et-al-on-climate-sensitivity/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Climate Etc. blog&lt;/a&gt; and attached your comments.
As you probably know, she is interested in the uncertainty aspects of climate science modeling and usually gets a good discussion going.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The tails are thin because the likelihood of the data in those areas of parameter space is very small, under the likelihood function we assumed.  The land and ocean contributions modify each other when combining the two data sources, but the ocean data are more influential on the final result.

Your second set of questions have to do with state-dependence of climate sensitivity.  We should expect some state dependence, but it&#039;s not clear how much (this may be rather model-dependent).

Our model does not completely ignore state dependence:  it shouldn&#039;t predict exactly the same warming for a CO2 doubling starting from glacial or interglacial states.  For example, we have an interactive sea ice model, and its sea ice (and associated temperature changes) will do different things in response to increased CO2 depending on what state you start from.

However, to conclude something about modern CO2 changes from paleo CO2 changes, we do have to assume that there is some physics in common between glacial and interglacial states.   Our methodology assumes that glacial and interglacial states obey the same relationship between temperature and outgoing longwave radiation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I went through the paper pretty carefully.

Why are the tails so thin on all those PDFs ? 
Except for the Land PDF they drop down to the 1e-17 level very rapidly. Doesn&#039;t this modify the Land contributions when you work out the Markov chain reconstruction  using Bayes rule?

Aren&#039;t we sitting in the ice-age corner of the climate energy potential well using data from the Last Glacial Maximum? How does this translate to climate sensitivity in a warmer climate when we are almost on the other side of the well currently? It seems like the sensitivity is bumping up against the latent heat of fusion for making lots of sea-ice when we are working in an ice-age climate.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Florifulgurator,

There is no obvious relationship between climate sensitivity and how it should vary with the base climate.  One might intuitively expect a different ice albedo feedback from the LGM to pre-industrial vs. pre-industrial-2xCO2 (though as Nathan Urban mentioned, ice sheets are imposed as changed boundary conditions, or forcings, and thus do not necessarily mean an enhanced albedo feedback).

  But the ice-albedo feedback is rather small globally, with the exception of possible bifurcation points into a snowball regime.  The water vapor feedback tends to be much more important, and that increases at higher temperatures (though, so does the negative lapse rate feedback).  The Planck radiative feedback is also non-linear.  Clouds might also behave differently between climate states and no one really understands those effects.  

Thus, whether climate sensitivity is higher at the LGM or in a greenhouse world really requires a highly model and parameter-dependent answer.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Over on Google+, Nick Barnes points out this discussion of the paper we&#039;re talking about here:

&#8226; James Annan, &lt;a href=&quot;http://julesandjames.blogspot.com/2011/11/more-on-schmittner.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;More on Schmittner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;James&#039; Empty Blog&lt;/i&gt;, 24 November 2011.

and Pedro J. Hdez points out this:

A quote from the latter:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There are some unusual aspects about this study which require further investigation before the conclusions of the study can be accepted, as the authors themselves point out.  For example, the study uses a relatively new global mean surface temperature reconstruction for the LGM [last glacial maximum] of just 2.2 °C cooler than interglacial temperatures in the locations where they have proxy data, or 2.6°C when averaging globally.  This is significantly lower than most paleoclimate estimates, which generally put the LGM in the range of 4 to 7 °C cooler than current temperatures.  For comparison, in their study also using the LGM to constrain climate sensitivity, Hansen and Sato (2011) used a mean surface temperature change of 5°C, consistent with the body of literature (see Fig. 2).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I just had a look at Hansen&#039;s Storms book, which has an excellent index. On p. 46 he says
&lt;blockquote&gt;But sensitivity depends on the climate state.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
(His fig. 30 seems to tell my Snowball Earth example is wrong.) On p.234, regarding a paper by Zachos, Zeebe, Dickens (2009) on the PETM, Hansen is
&lt;blockquote&gt;... suggesting that their analysis is evidence that climate sensitivity in the warmer early Cenozoic was greater than 3 degree Celsius ...&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

and he quoted this part:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Past climates can help us work out the true climate sensitivity, says Gavin Schmidt of the NASA Goddard Institute of Space Studies in New York City. But he says the results of Schmittner&#039;s study aren&#039;t strong enough to change his mind about the climate sensitivity. &#039;I don&#039;t expect this to impact consensus estimates,&#039; he says.

&quot;In particular, the model that Schmittner used in his analysis underestimates the cooling in Antarctica and the mid-latitudes. &#039;The model estimate of the cooling during the Last Glacial Maximum is a clear underestimate,&#039; Schmidt says. &#039;A different model would give a cooler Last Glacial Maximum, and thus a larger sensitivity.&#039;
