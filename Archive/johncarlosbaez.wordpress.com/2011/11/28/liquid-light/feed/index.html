Thank you for answering.

To be honest, I think the work you are doing now on network theory is maybe getting you closer to the answers than what you were doing before and maybe even closer than Urs and Jacob. 

I&#039;m still one of your biggest fans :)]]></description>

When I say I&#039;m happy with quantum mechanics, I mean several things.  

First, I don&#039;t want to &#039;explain it away&#039; by finding some way for it to sit on top of some &#039;more classical&#039; framework, like hidden variables or Bohmian mechanics.  I think we need to understand it head-on.  That&#039;s why I&#039;m not interested in that &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2010/quantum-mechanics-1020.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;water droplet model&lt;/a&gt;.  Not as a model of quantum mechanics, anyway!  

But why don&#039;t I want to &#039;explain it away&#039;?

It&#039;s because I&#039;m happy that &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/quantum/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the things that seem weird about Hilbert spaces and operators in quantum mechanics are mainly the ways in which they resemble space and spacetime more than sets and functions&lt;/a&gt;.    
 
It makes me feel confident we&#039;ll understand quantum theory better when we unify it with our description of spacetime in a theory of quantum gravity.   Even better, it gives a bunch of precise clues about how to do this!

A lot of work &lt;a href=&quot;http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/An+Exercise+in+Kantization&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Urs Schreiber&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.0465&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Jacob Lurie&lt;/a&gt; and others have been doing seems to confirm that yes, this idea is on the right track.

Those folks are very smart, so I think it&#039;s best if I work on something else.  I feel I contributed a lot at an early stage, but now the puzzle has reached a stage where people who are good at (&#8734;,n)-categories will contribute the most.  

So, if I feel haunted at all, it&#039;s just about quitting this particular project before it was done.  But I don&#039;t think it needs me, so I should work on something that does.]]></description>

Out of curiosity, when you say you are happy with quantum mechanics, does that mean you have answered Feynman&#039;s question,&quot;But how can it be like that?&quot; (from Character of Physical Law)? Or have you accepted that it cannot be understood?

It&#039;s difficult for me to conceive of anyone truly being happy with quantum mechanics unless they&#039;ve given up. It doesn&#039;t keep me up at night anymore because I am no longer a scientist, but if I was, the question would haunt me forever.]]></description>

It&#039;s hard to know what to say.  Since I&#039;m happy with ordinary quantum mechanics and less happy about Bohm&#039;s theory and other &#039;pilot wave&#039; theories, the idea of using droplets on vibrating water as a model for Bohmian quantum mechanics does not excite me.  But to me, the dynamics of those water droplets seems fairly fun to study for its own sake!

Someone who was less happy with ordinary quantum mechanics could easily have a different opinion.]]></description>

I&#039;d be curious to know if people here think that this research has the potential to offer some insight on quantum mechanics. On the other hand, from what i know, the Bohm theory is already on very solid ground and essentially equivalent to QM (not sure if that still holds also when relativity comes into play though), so, in a sense, probably not very groundbreaking ...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/11/28/liquid-light/#comment-11031&quot;&gt;Speed&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks to all for the comments.

I have a habit of doing sanity checks on numbers and like John I had to look up the speed of sound in air (well, in m/sec -- I know about what it is in MPH) and in a well known solid (steel as Todd points out). Then I reviewed the factors that determine the speed and I even looked around for a quotation of speed in a plasma -- no joy. So I asked the question.

I also wondered how one achieves such high speeds in a lab environment. Hypersonic wind tunnels (Mach five to 15) and Hot Shot wind tunnels (up to Mach 27) are interesting and complex devices (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersonic_wind_tunnel&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Hypersonic wind tunnel&lt;/a&gt; for an overview).

My guess is that there is some physics magic involved using magnets or electrical potentials rather than high pressures or explosives. As John said, the particles are, in terms of the world we inhabit, massless. Almost.]]></description>

And by the way, this factor of mass&lt;sup&gt;-1/2&lt;/sup&gt; is not completely bizarre.  If you have a mass at the end of a spring with a given spring constant, it&#039;ll vibrate faster if the mass is smaller, and in fact the period of the oscillation goes like mass&lt;sup&gt;-1/2&lt;/sup&gt;.   So we could probably understand all of this in a fairly pedestrian way if we kept working at it a few more days.]]></description>

Well, now I&#039;m thinking the superfluidity is not a red herring; perhaps just pink.   From what Frederik said above, and my back-of-the-envelope calculations, my guess is that for a bunch of superfluids the speed of sound is largely accounted for by the fact that it&#039;s proportional to the mass&lt;sup&gt;-1/2&lt;/sup&gt; of the particles in the superfluid!  Then the fact that polaritons are so absurdly light---10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt; the electron mass---is what makes sound in them so absurdly fast.]]></description>

I&#039;ll take your word for it!  So &lt;i&gt;everything else being equal&lt;/i&gt; (which it&#039;s probably not), since the polariton is &lt;i&gt;roughly&lt;/i&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; times lighter than a helium atom, we&#039;d expect sound to travel &lt;i&gt;roughly&lt;/i&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; faster in a polariton condensate than in superfluid helium.  We saw that the speed of sound in superfluid helium is about 250 meters per second.  So, we&#039;d expect sound to go &lt;i&gt;roughly&lt;/i&gt; 2.5 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; meters/second in the polariton condensate.  

The actual speed is 8.5 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; meters/second.  That&#039;s pretty close!
