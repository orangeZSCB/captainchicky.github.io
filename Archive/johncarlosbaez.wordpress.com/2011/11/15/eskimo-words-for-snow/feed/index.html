Thanks for all the knowledgeable replies!  To clarify my very unscientific anecdote: I&#039;d asked a linguist whether those long German compounds, or those crazy Welsh place names, were actually &quot;words&quot;, or just &quot;phrases with weird punctuation&quot;.  The reply I recall was along the lines of &quot;if you interrupt the German they will restart at the beginning, but if you interrupt an English speaker saying an equivalent phrase, they will tend to restart at a more recent word boundary&quot;.  That is, apparently the natural  large scale &quot;granularity&quot; really does vary with the language syntax, given roughly similar semantics.  However I wouldn&#039;t think this interruption technique is a fine enough probe to really resolve questions like whether &quot;of&quot; or &quot;&#039;s&quot; are &quot;words&quot; in the same way that, say, &quot;off&quot; or &quot;is&quot; or &quot;soft&quot; or &quot;hiss&quot; are.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/11/15/eskimo-words-for-snow/#comment-10943&quot;&gt;Toby Bartels&lt;/a&gt;.

To find out the facts about such matters the current standard approach is &#039;Conversation Analysis&#039;, which is conceptually very different from standard linguistics (it was developed some sociologists), and not very well developed for &#039;exotic languages&#039;, but both of these matters are being addressed. Here is a blog posting with some entry points:

http://australianlanguages.wordpress.com/2011/05/09/studies-in-australian-indigenous-conversation/

A standard source of problem-children for the question of &#039;what is a word&#039; are so-called &#039;clitics&#039;, which are basically items that combine word-like and affix-like properties in confusing ways.  An example is the possessive &quot; &#039;s &quot; in English, which is pronounced as a unit with the preceeding word, and has same system of alternate forms (allomorphs) as uncontroversial affixes such as plural and 3rd Sing Present -s (the dogz bowl, the cats bowl, the hors@z stall (@ for the &#039;schwa&#039; vowel), but can be tacked onto the end of complex NPs including even relative clauses:

 the man who we sold our car to&#039;s swimming pool is nice.

(the traditionally-termed &#039;group genitive&#039; construction)

The requirement that &quot; &#039;s &quot; constitute a phonological unit with what it follows is the most likely explanation for why the group genitive can&#039;t come after nonrestrictive relative clauses, since these are set off by pauses:

 *John, who we sold our car to, *&#039;s swimming pool is nice.

So, the positional properties of this item make it appear to be an independent word in the syntax (technically, a &#039;postposition&#039;, comparable to &#039;ago&#039; and &#039;notwithstanding&#039;), while its phonological ones make it seem like an affix.

There are &#039;enclitics&#039;, which are attached to what they follow, and &#039;proclitics&#039;, attached to what they precede, and some evidence that they are inherently confusing wrt word boundaries is that it is precisely with their pro- and en-clitics that the Ancient Greeks were very inconsistent with in their use of word-dividers (when scrawling obscene poems on rocks, according to the Powell book I cited earlier).  Currently, this book by Steve Anderson would be the best place to start learning about clitics:

http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199279906.do

Wrapping up, boundaries between clitics and their hosts would be unlikely locations for &#039;restart points&#039;.]]></description>

My use of the put-an-asterisk-in-front-of-the-misspelt-word-to-correct-it-when-you-can&#039;t-edit-your-comment convention demonstrates how you could tell in the case of written language.  I wonder how well that convention works in written languages that don&#039;t already settle the question with inter-word spacing.  (Chinese is an example that has a large presence on the Internet, but I know very little about Chinese-language Internet customs.  Although proper written Japanese has no inter-word spacing either, Internet Japanese is infested with slang kana, which uses it.)]]></description>

Somehow I’d taken “words” for granted.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mostly you can.  It&#039;s just that languages vary in the informational content that they can pack into a &quot;word&quot;.

(And also, that when it comes to writing what is logically a word in the language and what gets written as a word may not be in one-to-one correspondence).]]></description>

I just saw your question.  I&#039;m not sure what you are asking. (or rather, I can guess a couple different ways to approach the question, depending on exactly what you mean.)]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
So what does having 20+ words for ‘nothing’ say about us …
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Zip.  &lt;img src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/emoticons/tongue2.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;

Thanks for all these references; I will work my way from the less serious to the more so.  Actually De Clercq says a &#039;squatative&#039; is &#039;a class of taboo words that can be used to express negation&#039;, which would rule out &#039;nada&#039; or &#039;zip&#039;.  I don&#039;t see why taboo-ness is &lt;i&gt;grammatically&lt;/i&gt; important, but it certainly gives her an excuse to write a paper that&#039;s funny to read!
