When and if I reach a sufficient level of understanding I will explain the main points pro and contra climate models, but it is a very complex subject. Nordhaus mentions a very important point: 

In order to have confidence in numerical results, we need to know how the results vary if we vary the boundary and initial conditions! 

(Maybe the authors of the &quot;Limits of Growth&quot; should have done that and did not, I don&#039;t know.)

In an ideal world we would be able to prove the stability of certain qualitative features that we use to infer our conclusions, which can be done for a lot of mathematical toy models, for example. For global circulation models this is not possible, they are just too complicated. 

A pragmatic viewpoint is to simply test the model by running it again and again with small variations in the boundary and initial conditions.

Climate modellers do that, too, and they need your help: Please go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://climateprediction.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;climateprediction.net&lt;/a&gt;, donwload the necessary software to your computer and let it run a climate model when it is idle. 

At this point in the story of climate models, this is the only way to find out how stable these models are.]]></description>

There are a lot of blogs and websites where scientists and other people spend their time debunking baloney, especially in such subjects as evolutionary biology and climate change.  If there are any readers out there seeking such a blog for climate change, I recommend these:

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.skepticalscience.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Skeptical Science&lt;/a&gt;.

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.realclimate.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Real Climate&lt;/a&gt;.

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scienceofdoom.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Science of Doom&lt;/a&gt;.

And on a more political charged note:

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;http://thinkprogress.org/tag/global-warming&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Climate Progress&lt;/a&gt;.

If you want to call someone a charlatan or say something is a bunch of BS, I recommend this last one!]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I’ve been wondering for long why much of the climate model bashing comes from “economists” and their camp (one notable exception being Dyson’s infamous “climate models are rubbish”). It looks the driver is more than just Serious People wanting to save their world view of eternal growth.

So, a major inspiration of this seems to be Nordhaus?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nordhaus accepts mainstream view of climate change. If you don&#039;t believe, look at his &lt;a href=&quot;http://nordhaus.econ.yale.edu/documents/Nordhaus_Copenhagen_2010_text.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;latest&lt;/a&gt; study.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Right at the beginning of this article, Nordhaus claims that the Limits to Growth study cannot be taken as meaningful, for it belongs to a class of mathematical models that feature

(a) discrete time steps, and
(b) negative feedback.

He proceeds to explain that we have learned in the 20th century that, generically speaking, such systems may exhibit chaos.

[...]

So, his criticism may be valid for some particular research article containing simulation work that does funny things if one slightly modifies the time step. As a blanket criticism of all research that solves ODEs by non-analytic means, it certainly has no substance.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But Nordhaus is not saying that all dynamical models are wrong, or that solving ODE&#039;s by numerical approximation is wrong (where did you get that?). He is talking specifically about Limits to Growth study&#039;s claim that &quot;overshooting&quot; is a robust property of their predictions. His point is that claiming &quot;robust&quot; properties of solutions in nonlinear systems with possibly complicated dynamics and uncertainty in parameters should be done with caution. Sounds like a good advice.

And anyway, he spends about two pages out of forty on this, so it&#039;s not like that&#039;s his main point. Accusing somebody of scientific misconduct is quite serious, and I think you are greatly exaggerating here.]]></description>

I haven&#039;t read Nordhaus&#039; comments regarding discretization and chaos, only your account of them &#8212; and by that account they do seem misleading.   

However, my aim for this blog is to focus on science, not the possibly naughty behavior of individual scientists.

Nathan Urban used Nordhaus&#039; DICE model in his work on the possible collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Ocean Circulation, which we talked about in &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/11/05/this-weeks-finds-week-305/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&quot;week305&quot;&lt;/a&gt;.  Nathan&#039;s model required some assumptions on the world economy and its CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.   Back then, &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/11/05/this-weeks-finds-week-305/#comment-2466&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;streamfortyseven&lt;/a&gt; asked Nathan:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
What assumptions do you make about population growth, and population, over this time scale of nearly 300 years?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

I hope Nathan answers your questions in more detail: these are some issues I really want to understand!   But just so he doesn&#039;t need to repeat himself, this is from the interview:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;b&gt;JB:&lt;/b&gt; ... don’t the extrapolations become more unreliable as you keep marching further into the future? You need to model not only climate physics but also the world economy.  In this calculation, how many gigatons of carbon dioxide per year are you assuming will be emitted in 2300? I’m just curious. In 1998 it was about 27.6 gigatons. By 2008, it was about 30.4.

&lt;b&gt;NU&lt;/b&gt;: Yes, the uncertainty grows with time (and this is reflected in our projections). And in considering a fixed emissions scenario, we’ve ignored the economic uncertainty, which, so far out into the future, is even larger than the climate uncertainty. Here we’re concentrating on just the climate uncertainty, and are hoping to get an idea of bounds, so we used something close to a worst-case economic scenario. In this scenario carbon emissions peak around 2150 at about 23 gigatons carbon per year (84 gigatons CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). By 2300 they’ve tapered off to about 4 GtC (15 GtCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

Actual future emissions may be less than this, if we act to reduce them, or there are fewer economically extractable fossil resources than we assume, or the economy takes a prolonged downturn, etc. Actually, it’s not completely an economic worst case; it’s possible that the world economy could grow even faster than we assume. And it’s not the worst case scenario from a climate perspective, either. For example, we don’t model potential carbon emissions from permafrost or methane clathrates. It’s also possible that climate sensitivity could be higher than what we find in our analysis.

&lt;b&gt;JB:&lt;/b&gt; Why even bother projecting so far out into the future, if it’s so uncertain?

NU: The main reason is because it takes a while for the AMOC to weaken, so if we’re interested in what it would take to make it collapse, we have to run the projections out a few centuries. But another motivation for writing this paper is policy related, having to do with the concept of &quot;climate commitment&quot; or &quot;triggering&quot;. Even if it takes a few centuries for the AMOC to collapse, it may take less time than that to reach a &quot;point of no return&quot;, where a future collapse has already been unavoidably &quot;triggered&quot;. Again, to investigate this question, we have to run the projections out far enough to get the AMOC to collapse.

[...]

&lt;b&gt;JB:&lt;/b&gt; What scenario, or scenarios, did you consider?

&lt;b&gt;NU:&lt;/b&gt; We considered a worst-case &quot;business as usual&quot; scenario in which we continue to burn fossil fuels at an accelerating rate until we start to run out of them, and eventually burn the maximum amount of fossil fuels we think there might be remaining (about 5000 gigatons worth of of carbon, compared to the roughly 500 gigatons we’ve emitted so far). This assumes we get desperate for cheap energy and extract all the hard-to-get fossil resources in oil shales and tar sands, all the remaining coal, etc. It doesn’t necessarily preclude the use of non-fossil energy; it just assumes that our appetite for energy grows so rapidly that there’s no incentive to slow down fossil fuel extraction. We used a simple economic model to estimate how fast we might do this, if the world economy continues to grow at a similar rate to the last few decades.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here&#039;s the graph from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.princeton.edu/~nurban/pubs/moc-projections.pdf#page=5&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;his paper&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/nathan_urban_carbon_emissions.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Here&#039;s what the paper says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
For projections beyond the year 2009, future forcings from fossil CO2 emissions, from non-CO2 greenhouse gas, and anthropogenic aerosols are adopted from Nordhaus (2007) following a business-as-usual (BAU) emissions scenario, yielding cumulative fossil fuel emissions of about 4800 GtC from 2000–2300. The CO2 emissions are plotted in Figure 1. Land-use CO2 emissions decay linearly from 2009 levels to zero in 2100 and are zero thereafter.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The reference to Nordhaus is:

&#8226; Nordhaus, W. D. 2007. The challenge of global warming: Economic models and environmental policy, Technical report, &lt;a href=&quot;http://nordhaus.econ.yale.edu/DICE2007.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://nordhaus.econ.yale.edu/DICE2007.htm&lt;/a&gt;, accessed May 2, 2007, model version: DICE-2007.delta.v7.

A writeup describing Nordhaus&#039; 2007 model is here:

&#8226; William D. Nordhaus, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nordhaus.econ.yale.edu/Balance_2nd_proofs.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;A Question of Balance: Weighing the Options on Global Warming Policies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, Yale University Press, New Haven, 2008.

A version of this book is free online &#8212; just click!

Since I&#039;m just looking at this 248-page book for the first time right now, I can&#039;t say much about where the curve above comes from.  I will note, though, that on &lt;a href=&quot;http://nordhaus.econ.yale.edu/Balance_2nd_proofs.pdf#page=141&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;page 127 of his book&lt;/a&gt;, Nordhaus estimates that a total of 6&#177;1.2 trillion metric tons of carbon are available to be burnt.  Currently we&#039;ve burnt about 0.54 trillion tons, and people are wringing their hands about &lt;a href=&quot;http://trillionthtonne.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the trillionth ton&lt;/a&gt;, with some estimating it will be burnt by around 2044.

On the same page, Nordhaus estimates that the world population will level off at 8.6&#177;1.9 billion.

Anyway, I hope Nathan weighs in — this is just to get the ball rolling.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nathan said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I don&#039;t intend to &quot;weigh in&quot; too heavily, since I&#039;m not an energy economist.  I can offer a few general points and pointers to references.

Fossil fuel emissions in the &quot;business as usual&quot; (BAU) scenarios that are usually considered are not driven primarily by population growth.  They&#039;re mostly driven by an assumption of continued &lt;em&gt;economic&lt;/em&gt; growth,  particularly that the rest of the developing world will eventually grow to consume energy at intensities similar to European, or U.S., consumption patterns (barring additional economic incentives to strive for low energy intensities).

This is coupled to an assumption that there is a large amount of fossil carbon available in coal, tar sands, and oil shales (thousands of gigatons), and that eventual high energy demand will make it economically worthwhile to extract most or all of that carbon.

This doesn&#039;t preclude growth in alternative energy, simply that energy demand will be high enough that we&#039;ll eventually want to dig up all that fossil carbon anyway, in addition to whatever alternative energy we deploy.

Nordhaus&#039;s DICE model is one way to turn these assumptions into an emissions trajectory.  I should also point people toward the &quot;Representative Concentration Pathway&quot; (RCP) scenarios (overview &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v463/n7282/abs/nature08823.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), which is what the IPCC will be using in its next assessment report.

You can view (preliminary versions of?) these scenarios with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web-apps/tnt/RcpDb/dsd?Action=htmlpage&#038;page=compare&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this browser&lt;/a&gt;.  The emissions projections go out to 2100, and they have &quot;extension scenarios&quot; (ECPs) for CO2 concentrations (not emissions) out to 2300.

Their BAU scenario is called RCP8.5, and it is based on (but not identical to?) work in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Research/TNT/WEB/PUB/TFSC_74_7/long_term_scenarios.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt;, which outlines growth scenarios.  (They don&#039;t explicitly discuss fossil carbon constraints because in this scenario they implicitly assume that there is enough carbon to avoid peaking before 2100, the last date they consider.)

All the other RCP scenarios are &quot;stabilization&quot; or mitigation scenarios where society opts to stabilize at below-BAU CO2 concentrations, or reduce emissions even further.

The RCPs and ECPs look like this:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://img180.imageshack.us/img180/1134/rcp2100.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;http://img180.imageshack.us/img180/1134/rcp2100.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://img64.imageshack.us/img64/1271/ecp2300.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;http://img64.imageshack.us/img64/1271/ecp2300.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

RCP8.5 appears to have a slightly larger and sooner peak than the DICE BAU scenario, but is fairly comparable.  Looking at the ECP concentrations, they seem to be assuming a similar total fossil resource constraint (~5000 GtC).  The other ECPs assume stabilization at some CO2 concentration around 2150, or even a decline.

I don&#039;t know that I personally believe that we will go after ever last scrap of carbon we think may be in the ground.  As I said in the interview, we intentionally considered a &quot;worst case&quot; scenario.

I do think there&#039;s a serious risk that we&#039;ll extract, say, half that amount, and reach quadrupled (from pre-industrial) CO2 levels some time in the century after this one.  That would require extracting what are currently low grade and unprofitable reserves, but they will become more profitable as other sources are depleted.

Eventually fossil prices will rise, and alternative energy prices drop, to the point that it&#039;s more profitable to switch completely to non-fossil energy.  Absent price controls on carbon, I am not convinced this will happen fast enough to avoid some pretty high CO2 levels.

There are other scenarios that lead to lower fossil fuel consumption, such as a global economic collapse leading to permanently depressed economic growth, or otherwise lower continued growth than we&#039;ve seen historically based on our fossil energy economy.  (There are also scenarios of enhanced economic growth...)  Even so, a lowered rate of growth doesn&#039;t necessarily imply a lowered final CO2 concentration, just that we&#039;d hit it at a later date. 

I can&#039;t venture my own estimate as to what I think will come to pass.  For my policy work I choose to use what appears in the mainstream climate economic literature, and if those estimates change, so will my projections.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It seems clear that all long-term economic projections are quite &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thefreedictionary.com/dicey&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;dicey&lt;/a&gt;: that&#039;s not Nordhaus&#039; fault.   However, some such projections may be wiser than others.  So, to me the most interesting question is whether Nordhaus&#039; DICE model could be significantly improved without enormous amounts of work.  ]]></description>

<p>I haven&#8217;t read Nordhaus&#8217; comments regarding discretization and chaos, only your account of them &mdash; and by that account they do seem misleading.   </p>
<p>However, my aim for this blog is to focus on science, not the possibly naughty behavior of individual scientists.</p>
<p>Nathan Urban used Nordhaus&#8217; DICE model in his work on the possible collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Ocean Circulation, which we talked about in <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/11/05/this-weeks-finds-week-305/" rel="nofollow">&#8220;week305&#8221;</a>.  Nathan&#8217;s model required some assumptions on the world economy and its CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.   Back then, <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/11/05/this-weeks-finds-week-305/#comment-2466" rel="nofollow">streamfortyseven</a> asked Nathan:</p>
<blockquote><p>
What assumptions do you make about population growth, and population, over this time scale of nearly 300 years?
</p></blockquote>
<p>I said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I hope Nathan answers your questions in more detail: these are some issues I really want to understand!   But just so he doesn&#8217;t need to repeat himself, this is from the interview:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>JB:</b> &#8230; don’t the extrapolations become more unreliable as you keep marching further into the future? You need to model not only climate physics but also the world economy.  In this calculation, how many gigatons of carbon dioxide per year are you assuming will be emitted in 2300? I’m just curious. In 1998 it was about 27.6 gigatons. By 2008, it was about 30.4.</p>
<p><b>NU</b>: Yes, the uncertainty grows with time (and this is reflected in our projections). And in considering a fixed emissions scenario, we’ve ignored the economic uncertainty, which, so far out into the future, is even larger than the climate uncertainty. Here we’re concentrating on just the climate uncertainty, and are hoping to get an idea of bounds, so we used something close to a worst-case economic scenario. In this scenario carbon emissions peak around 2150 at about 23 gigatons carbon per year (84 gigatons CO<sub>2</sub>). By 2300 they’ve tapered off to about 4 GtC (15 GtCO<sub>2</sub>).</p>
<p>Actual future emissions may be less than this, if we act to reduce them, or there are fewer economically extractable fossil resources than we assume, or the economy takes a prolonged downturn, etc. Actually, it’s not completely an economic worst case; it’s possible that the world economy could grow even faster than we assume. And it’s not the worst case scenario from a climate perspective, either. For example, we don’t model potential carbon emissions from permafrost or methane clathrates. It’s also possible that climate sensitivity could be higher than what we find in our analysis.</p>
<p><b>JB:</b> Why even bother projecting so far out into the future, if it’s so uncertain?</p>
<p>NU: The main reason is because it takes a while for the AMOC to weaken, so if we’re interested in what it would take to make it collapse, we have to run the projections out a few centuries. But another motivation for writing this paper is policy related, having to do with the concept of &#8220;climate commitment&#8221; or &#8220;triggering&#8221;. Even if it takes a few centuries for the AMOC to collapse, it may take less time than that to reach a &#8220;point of no return&#8221;, where a future collapse has already been unavoidably &#8220;triggered&#8221;. Again, to investigate this question, we have to run the projections out far enough to get the AMOC to collapse.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p><b>JB:</b> What scenario, or scenarios, did you consider?</p>
<p><b>NU:</b> We considered a worst-case &#8220;business as usual&#8221; scenario in which we continue to burn fossil fuels at an accelerating rate until we start to run out of them, and eventually burn the maximum amount of fossil fuels we think there might be remaining (about 5000 gigatons worth of of carbon, compared to the roughly 500 gigatons we’ve emitted so far). This assumes we get desperate for cheap energy and extract all the hard-to-get fossil resources in oil shales and tar sands, all the remaining coal, etc. It doesn’t necessarily preclude the use of non-fossil energy; it just assumes that our appetite for energy grows so rapidly that there’s no incentive to slow down fossil fuel extraction. We used a simple economic model to estimate how fast we might do this, if the world economy continues to grow at a similar rate to the last few decades.

<p>Here&#8217;s what the paper says:</p>
<blockquote><p>
For projections beyond the year 2009, future forcings from fossil CO2 emissions, from non-CO2 greenhouse gas, and anthropogenic aerosols are adopted from Nordhaus (2007) following a business-as-usual (BAU) emissions scenario, yielding cumulative fossil fuel emissions of about 4800 GtC from 2000–2300. The CO2 emissions are plotted in Figure 1. Land-use CO2 emissions decay linearly from 2009 levels to zero in 2100 and are zero thereafter.

<p>Since I&#8217;m just looking at this 248-page book for the first time right now, I can&#8217;t say much about where the curve above comes from.  I will note, though, that on <a href="http://nordhaus.econ.yale.edu/Balance_2nd_proofs.pdf#page=141" rel="nofollow">page 127 of his book</a>, Nordhaus estimates that a total of 6&#177;1.2 trillion metric tons of carbon are available to be burnt.  Currently we&#8217;ve burnt about 0.54 trillion tons, and people are wringing their hands about <a href="http://trillionthtonne.org/" rel="nofollow">the trillionth ton</a>, with some estimating it will be burnt by around 2044.</p>
<p>On the same page, Nordhaus estimates that the world population will level off at 8.6&#177;1.9 billion.</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope Nathan weighs in — this is just to get the ball rolling.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nathan said:</p>
<blockquote><p>
I don&#8217;t intend to &#8220;weigh in&#8221; too heavily, since I&#8217;m not an energy economist.  I can offer a few general points and pointers to references.</p>
<p>Fossil fuel emissions in the &#8220;business as usual&#8221; (BAU) scenarios that are usually considered are not driven primarily by population growth.  They&#8217;re mostly driven by an assumption of continued <em>economic</em> growth,  particularly that the rest of the developing world will eventually grow to consume energy at intensities similar to European, or U.S., consumption patterns (barring additional economic incentives to strive for low energy intensities).</p>
<p>This is coupled to an assumption that there is a large amount of fossil carbon available in coal, tar sands, and oil shales (thousands of gigatons), and that eventual high energy demand will make it economically worthwhile to extract most or all of that carbon.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t preclude growth in alternative energy, simply that energy demand will be high enough that we&#8217;ll eventually want to dig up all that fossil carbon anyway, in addition to whatever alternative energy we deploy.</p>
<p>Nordhaus&#8217;s DICE model is one way to turn these assumptions into an emissions trajectory.  I should also point people toward the &#8220;Representative Concentration Pathway&#8221; (RCP) scenarios (overview <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v463/n7282/abs/nature08823.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>), which is what the IPCC will be using in its next assessment report.</p>
<p>You can view (preliminary versions of?) these scenarios with <a href="http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web-apps/tnt/RcpDb/dsd?Action=htmlpage&amp;page=compare" rel="nofollow">this browser</a>.  The emissions projections go out to 2100, and they have &#8220;extension scenarios&#8221; (ECPs) for CO2 concentrations (not emissions) out to 2300.</p>
<p>Their BAU scenario is called RCP8.5, and it is based on (but not identical to?) work in <a href="http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Research/TNT/WEB/PUB/TFSC_74_7/long_term_scenarios.pdf" rel="nofollow">this paper</a>, which outlines growth scenarios.  (They don&#8217;t explicitly discuss fossil carbon constraints because in this scenario they implicitly assume that there is enough carbon to avoid peaking before 2100, the last date they consider.)</p>
<p>All the other RCP scenarios are &#8220;stabilization&#8221; or mitigation scenarios where society opts to stabilize at below-BAU CO2 concentrations, or reduce emissions even further.</p>
<p>The RCPs and ECPs look like this:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://img180.imageshack.us/img180/1134/rcp2100.png" rel="nofollow"><br />
<img width="450" src="https://i2.wp.com/img180.imageshack.us/img180/1134/rcp2100.png" /></a><br />
<a href="http://img64.imageshack.us/img64/1271/ecp2300.png" rel="nofollow"><br />
<img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/img64.imageshack.us/img64/1271/ecp2300.png" /><br />
</a>
</div>
<p>RCP8.5 appears to have a slightly larger and sooner peak than the DICE BAU scenario, but is fairly comparable.  Looking at the ECP concentrations, they seem to be assuming a similar total fossil resource constraint (~5000 GtC).  The other ECPs assume stabilization at some CO2 concentration around 2150, or even a decline.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know that I personally believe that we will go after ever last scrap of carbon we think may be in the ground.  As I said in the interview, we intentionally considered a &#8220;worst case&#8221; scenario.</p>
<p>I do think there&#8217;s a serious risk that we&#8217;ll extract, say, half that amount, and reach quadrupled (from pre-industrial) CO2 levels some time in the century after this one.  That would require extracting what are currently low grade and unprofitable reserves, but they will become more profitable as other sources are depleted.</p>
<p>Eventually fossil prices will rise, and alternative energy prices drop, to the point that it&#8217;s more profitable to switch completely to non-fossil energy.  Absent price controls on carbon, I am not convinced this will happen fast enough to avoid some pretty high CO2 levels.</p>
<p>There are other scenarios that lead to lower fossil fuel consumption, such as a global economic collapse leading to permanently depressed economic growth, or otherwise lower continued growth than we&#8217;ve seen historically based on our fossil energy economy.  (There are also scenarios of enhanced economic growth&#8230;)  Even so, a lowered rate of growth doesn&#8217;t necessarily imply a lowered final CO2 concentration, just that we&#8217;d hit it at a later date. </p>
<p>I can&#8217;t venture my own estimate as to what I think will come to pass.  For my policy work I choose to use what appears in the mainstream climate economic literature, and if those estimates change, so will my projections.
</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems clear that all long-term economic projections are quite <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/dicey" rel="nofollow">dicey</a>: that&#8217;s not Nordhaus&#8217; fault.

					<description><![CDATA[John,

apologies - I did not notice. You are right that such terms evoke emotional reactions in some readers that are not helpful when trying to actually get to the core of the problem.

Let me give some detail. This is Nordhaus&#039;s article in question, &quot;Lethal Model 2 - The Limits to Growth Revisited&quot;:

http://www.sc-eco.univ-nantes.fr/~tvallee/memoire/model-DICE/nordhaus/Lethal%20Model%202.pdf

Right at the beginning of this article, Nordhaus claims that the Limits to Growth study cannot be taken as meaningful, for it belongs to a class of mathematical models that feature

(a) discrete time steps, and 
(b) negative feedback.

He proceeds to explain that we have learned in the 20th century that, generically speaking, such systems may exhibit chaos. The example he gives is just a slightly re-dressed form of the Logistic Map - period doubling bifurcations, Feigenbaum scenario, chaos, and all that. Hence, his conclusion, LtG is a rubbish model.

The problem with this is two-fold. On the one hand, his argument is not valid, because the role of discrete time is to allow us to put a continuous-time model on the computer, and one can validate whether the discretization produces artefacts. As we all know, a one-dimensional continuous time system described by an ODE of the form dy(t)/dt = f(y(t),t) won&#039;t exhibit chaos. The reason is simple: If you have two solutions y1(t) and y2(t), these evidently never can cross. This sets a very obvious limit to how bad 1-dimensional phase portraits can become. If you instead look at a clocked system with governing equation y_n+1 = f(y_n,n), there is nothing that prevents y from &quot;jumping&quot; and behaving in pretty wild ways.

Evidently, some clocked systems approximate the behaviour of continuous time systems. Those are the ones we are interested in in this context here. In particular, we get such clocked systems by using some fixed-time-step discretization scheme when describing continuous physics. If such a discrete-time-version-of-continuum-physics 1-d model exhibits chaos, this is a clear indication that we are using too large a time step, for the continuous-time system won&#039;t. Note that delta-y is delta-t*y&#039; (for y&#039; evaluated at an appropriate intermediate point), and if 
delta-y is &quot;large&quot;, this is an indication that we are using an inappropriate delta-t. Hence, no large jumps from one time step to the next in a properly discretized model.

We see: it&#039;s readily validated whether the approach to discretize time chosen is meaningful. Do results change substantially if we modify our time steps a bit?

So, his criticism may be valid for some particular research article containing simulation work that does funny things if one slightly modifies the time step. As a blanket criticism of all research that solves ODEs by non-analytic means, it certainly has no substance.

Furthermore, the other issue with this is that his DICE model for climate change itself uses discretized time steps. And evidently, negative feedback effects also exist in that model (more economic activity means more CO2 means more damage means less productive economy).

So, his mathematical objections invalidate his own work.

Do take a look at the paper referenced above. I think it speaks a clear language. This very strongly smells of an effort to bamboozle a less math-savvy audience into believing strange things by presenting some math hocus pocus that is above what average citizens can comprehend.

I consider this serious scientific misconduct. Even more so because the object of his study actually has massive relevance to society, and bad decisions may have incredibly harmful effects. However, somehow, as a society, we seem not to have learned yet to respond to such behaviour. One can get away with this sort of academic misconduct - but if, say, the German minister of defense is found out to have cheated when writing his doctoral dissertation (content-wise a highly irrelevant piece of work), the inevitable outcome is for him to lose his position. Isn&#039;t that odd?]]></description>

Even if somebody actually &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a jerk, a charlatan, or an idiot, you&#039;re not allowed to say that here.  You can, however,  say what is wrong with their work.  This policy is fundamental to making this blog a friendly, welcoming place.

Since I invited you to give an interview here I&#039;ll let you get away with using the word &#039;charlatan&#039; in your previous two comments, posted while I was asleep.  But no more!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I must substantiate the above charge of charlatanery against William Nordhaus. This is a very serious charge, and one should not raise it lightly. There is more evidence against Nordhaus than what we discussed so far.

He not only wrote about climate change, but also about finite resources. In an article he published not long before his climate change book, which is a response to the &quot;Limits to Growth&quot; update, he tries to make a very generic point about the fundamental non-predictiveness of the type of mathematical modeling used by the LtG team. The problem here is that if his argument had any substance, it could be applied without any change to his own DICE model for climate change!

So, to him, &quot;mathematical&quot; objections only are relevant if they can be used to make a case against other people&#039;s work - they don&#039;t matter if they also question his own work.

The article I am talking about is &quot;Lethal Model 2&quot; from 1992 - Google Scholar will give you a reference to the PDF. The reason why his argument is bogus is explained in introductory physics college textbooks, such as the German &quot;Gehrtsen Lehrbuch der Physik&quot; (it&#039;s an exercise question in chapter 18).]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I must substantiate the above charge of charlatanery against William Nordhaus. This is a very serious charge, and one should not raise it lightly. There is more evidence against Nordhaus than what we discussed so far.</p>
<p>He not only wrote about climate change, but also about finite resources.
