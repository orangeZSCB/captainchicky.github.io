Nah. One can tell youtube to skip to a certain point in a video by adding #t=MmSS (M=minutes, SS=seconds), but wordpress evidently does not know about that in embedded videos.

The part I wanted to reference above starts at 02:00.

(The guy at the beginning of this video is Patrick Whitefield, author of the &lt;i&gt;Earth Care Manual&lt;/i&gt;.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/06/06/this-weeks-finds-week-314/#comment-6229&quot;&gt;John Baez&lt;/a&gt;.

Well, it certainly is - and the insidious thing is that the conscious mind is very good at shielding us from understanding the actual reasons why we decided one way or another.

I cannot speak for Yudkowsky of course, but the way I explain to myself how I came to looking deeper into gardening-based approaches is as follows:

1. The problem is complex and multi-layered, but when dealing with a complex problem, it is often useful to ask the question: &quot;what are we most certain about?&quot; It is quite clear that we will have to e.g. close certain mineral nutrient cycles which are badly broken at the moment (such as the phosphate cycle) - it will happen one way or another, as a system that does not cycle phosphate cannot go on for long. So, depending on how we approach this issue, it can become fairly straightforward and simple, or very painful. Many questions of the &quot;what are we most certain about&quot; type quite naturally seem to lead to answers that are related to gardening.

2. I think it is generally problematic to rely on the invention of some new and shiny miracle technology to magically solve all our problems. Let&#039;s take nuclear power for example. Isn&#039;t it curious how it always is the next generation of reactors to be built that will finally be safe and clean and provide abundant cheap energy? In other places around the world, people are still dreaming of Thorium high temperature reactors. Turns out we did operate one in Germany which was shut off more than 20 years ago (under Helmut Kohl&#039;s conservative government by the way), THTR-300 in Hamm-Uentrop. That design actually wasn&#039;t overly convincing and had a number of nasty problems. It did look great on paper - before we found out what the relevant engineering issues are we had not known about beforehand.

I don&#039;t say that technological advances don&#039;t solve massive problems - but we usually only learn afterwards what the problems are that are easily solved with new tech and that are not. Remote communication, for example, never occurred to us as being technologically simple before Maxwell found the displacement current term.

So, I am naturally a bit skeptic when technological progress is turned into religious belief - this may well be a symptom of a misguided human ego believing in its omnipotence.

3. Concerning gardening - we can do that NOW, and we know it WORKS, as pioneers have demonstrated a number of viable models that combine a satisfying lifestyle with responsible use of fossil energy. This is Chris Dixon&#039;s carbon footprint analysis:

http://www.konsk.co.uk/design/energy2.html

If we all could get just halfway there (and there are numerous very different lifestyle models that would be compatible with this), that would pretty much solve a number of pressing problems.

This video is part of a BBC documentary (actually a fairly shallow general-audience one) from two years ago featuring a very short interview with Chris:

The &quot;before&quot; picture at 2:42 is quite interesting.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yes, great interview.  It&#039;s the discovery approach Thomas is taking that is refreshing, like &quot;biomimicry&quot; research.  It&#039;s also not too different from the approach I&#039;ve been taking in figuring out &quot;what&#039;s the problem with math and nature anyway&quot;.   In looking for what animates natural systems I started finding reasons why our models are invariably missing much of the key information needed.

I very  much like his statement about physical science reasoning:
&lt;blockquote&gt; it allows one to independently make up one’s mind about things where one otherwise would have little other choice than to believe what one is told. And so, I started to look deeper.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The main place nature keeps hiding scads of important information, the kind our models always seem to be missing is *inside* the animated processes that nucleation nucleates.  So I&#039;m very pleased to hear someone talking about employing nucleation.  Those kinds of processes are not following external rules but internal paths of accumulation.  That science has not looked for that before has meant, categorically, that our models contained information about inanimate relationships and not about the animating processes.  That&#039;s a VERY BIG &quot;tell-tale omission&quot; for the study of individually animated systems!

Following that lead is also partly how I discovered that the present standard method for measuring the energy consequences of business decisions measures only the energy uses of the inanimate parts of businesses.  It results in overlooking the fourfold or greater energy requirements for supporting the business&#039;s operating, manging and supporting parts.  Those are the vast array of human services needed to make the inanimate parts operable, that don&#039;t write down their energy uses for business accountants to see.   

So, energy uses of the machines are already all written down and in the file cabinet..., but those of supporting human services are not.  That resulted in those energy uses being visible, and being defined as &quot;the system&quot;.  Applying a physical science approach to reasoning would lead you to &quot;follow the energy&quot; to see what really makes the business work, exposing the major underestimate of (nominally) 500% and the complete mischaracterization of businesses as environmental systems with no animating parts!

Physical science reasoning can connect the dots, once you start looking for where nature is hiding the missing information.]]></description>

Plants - well, there are other wizards to learn about that. Here is Martin Crawford from the UK Agroforestry Research Trust (http://www.agroforestry.co.uk), for example:

(And don&#039;t forget the fungi. They are at least as important.)]]></description>

Depends on what you want to focus on. Concerning a practical hands-on introduction, Bill Mollison&#039;s &lt;i&gt;Introduction to Permaculture&lt;/i&gt; probably is the most evolved text.

If you want more theory but are fine with a less refined piece of work, then &lt;i&gt;Permaculture - A Designer&#039;s Manual&lt;/i&gt; is quite useful.

Concerning temperate climates (in particular, Europe), Patrick Whitefield&#039;s &lt;i&gt;The Earth Care Manual&lt;/i&gt; is a well researched piece of work that almost could be used as a college textbook. For Europeans, this would probably be my first recommendation.

There are numerous books I would not recommend, even by well known authors, but these three are quite readable. (The &lt;i&gt;Designer&#039;s Manual&lt;/i&gt; is a bit difficult to comprehend in some places, though, and it really helps to know a little bit about Mollison&#039;s biography to put it into context and see where certain ideas come from.)]]></description>

Tim,

I fully agree with your heuristic. (Ms. &quot;I am Rational&quot; Ayn Rand did in fact convince Nathaniel Branden that it would be &quot;rational&quot; to have an extramarital affair with her. Now that&#039;s an interesting kind of &quot;rationality&quot;, isn&#039;t it?)]]></description>
