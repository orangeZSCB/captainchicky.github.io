					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m trying to get a visa to go to Iran in 20 days.  The story so far:

The Iranian government has approved my visit, I was given a &#039;reference number&#039;, and my hosts told me to contact the Pakistani embassy in Washington DC - since there&#039;s no Iranian embassy there - and then go there and pick up the visa.  They probably forgot I was in Singapore.  

Anyway, I contacted the Pakistani embassy and they said &quot;hold on, we&#039;ll connect you to the department that does Iranian visas&quot;.  A woman answered and said &quot;Let me give you the number of the Iranian ?????&quot; - I couldn&#039;t quite hear the last word.   I said: &quot;but I was told to contact the Pakistani embassy&quot;.  She answered: &quot;and you did, and I&#039;m telling you to call the Iranian ?????.&quot;  I said: &quot;yup!&quot;

I called that number and a very friendly man asked me for the reference number.  I told him and he said &quot;No, we don&#039;t have anything under that number.  What&#039;s your passport number?&quot;  And I told him and he said &quot;No, we don&#039;t have anything under that number.  Maybe the fax didn&#039;t go through.  Contact your hosts and tell them to try again.&quot;  And since he was so friendly I said that while I was an American citizen, I was actually living in Singapore, and he said &quot;oh, then contact your hosts and have them get the government to send the reference number to the Iranian embassy in Singapore&quot;.

So I asked them to do that, and today I received my host an email saying &quot;There is no Iranian consulate in Singapore.  Can you go to Indonesia?  The Iranian embassy in Indonesia handles all visas for Singapore.&quot;

And I checked... and despite some tantalizing false alarms, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://iran.visahq.com/embassy/Singapore/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iranembassy-sg.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, it seems there&#039;s no Iranian embassy or consulate in Singapore.  If you know of one, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;PLEASE TELL ME!!!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

So, I said &quot;A ticket to Jakarta to visit the Iranian embassy in Indonesia will cost about $300, and the flight takes about 2 hours each way.  Do you want to pay for this, or should we decide this is too complicated?&quot;  

I&#039;ll keep you informed of what happens next.]]></description>

Well, in Iran, specially southern, as in much of the neighboring middle-east world, there is still a good percentage of houses built with old, very efficient, “natural” cooling systems. Typically one has a well with water under the house, and the corridors which tunnel air so that the air flows above the water, takes some humidity from there, cools in the process and lifts up. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hi!  Thanks for reminding me!   Maybe I can find a nice way to mention this in my talk.

A while back my friend Greg Egan visited the marvelous ancient city of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yazd.com/photos.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Yazd&lt;/a&gt; in Iran.  Here are two photos he took:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/diary/egan_Yazd2.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/diary/egan_Yazd1.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The second one shows a &lt;i&gt;bad gir&lt;/i&gt;, or &#039;windcatcher&#039;&#8212;a natural cooling system based on the Bernoulli effect.  

As you mentioned, a windcatcher is especially effective in conjunction with a &lt;i&gt;qanat&lt;/i&gt;&#8212;an underground water tunnel, commonly used for irrigation in the Middle East.  Here&#039;s how people combine a &lt;i&gt;qanat&lt;/i&gt; and a windcatcher:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/diary/Wind-Tower-and-Qanat-Cooling.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

I love the idea of this sort of system, since it doesn&#039;t use any external power source &#8212; just the wind, water and the laws of physics.  Green technology, centuries old!  

For more, see:

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Qanat&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Qanat&lt;/a&gt;, Azimuth Wiki.

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Windcatcher&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Windcatcher&lt;/a&gt;, Azimuth Wiki.

Here&#039;s a picture of Yazd from an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.irangashttour.com/en/cities.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Iranian tourist website&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/diary/yazd.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
&lt;img width=&quot;500&quot; src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/diary/yazd.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

I&#039;d love to visit Yazd.  Rafsanjan is less famous, but I now see it&#039;s supposed to have some traditional desert architecture.  I&#039;ll have to find out whether that includes &lt;i&gt;qanat&lt;/i&gt; or windcatchers!   

A tourist website recommends seeing the Hussain Abad, Qasem Abad and Abad Avaran water springs, and the Imamzadeh Shah Ismaiel and Sabahi mosques.

But what I really want to know about is Iranian mathematicians and physicists, and whether any are working on environmental issues.  ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well, in Iran, specially southern, as in much of the neighboring middle-east world, there is still a good percentage of houses built with old, very efficient, &quot;natural&quot; cooling systems. Typically one has a well with water under the house, and the corridors which tunnel air so that the air flows above the water, takes some humidity from there, cools in the process and litfs up. This is a sample of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Even in very hot areas, without energy-expensive modern air-conditioning they keep the houses cold. Much of the house efficiency research in the west is to get more sun in the winters, but very little about the natural cooling and even less for the well-assisted systems. I am not sure if the Iranians do some advancement of such systems for the modern buildings or they just employ it in the traditional housing ?

In the modern world summer electricity shortages are part in due to air-conditioning which is in most of the western places fir to disgustingly low temperatures. Coming to a typical university library or a public bus in summer clothes (short sleeves etc.) one feels cold: the temperature is below the temperature which they set their heaters on in winters when we use pullovers and thick trousers. The body suffers shock in changing the environment which has such harsh systems.
