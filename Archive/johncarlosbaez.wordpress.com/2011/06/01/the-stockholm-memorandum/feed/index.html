What leaders can do is lead, which can involve getting a bit ahead of public opinion, but mostly involves using their position to turn the ship of state slowly around by convincing the public.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the United States I&#039;d have to say the leaders are lagging behind the people they&#039;re supposedly leading&#8212;when it comes to doing something about climate change, that is.  See for example &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pollingreport.com/enviro.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.  

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The key to convincing the public is a vigorous open investigation of the facts, where the people who want the voters to pay a huge price to save the world are forced to justify their position using open data and open source code.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And what about the people who want to keep the status quo going as long as possible, regardless of whether it leads to a disaster in the long run?  Do they have any responsibilities?  

One thing I wish is that all taxpayer-funded scientific research were required by law to be made freely available---as most research funded by the US National Institutes of Health &lt;a href=&quot;http://publicaccess.nih.gov/FAQ.htm#753&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;already is:&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Director of the National Institutes of Health shall require that all investigators funded by the NIH submit or have submitted for them to the National Library of Medicine’s PubMed Central an electronic version of their final peer-reviewed manuscripts upon acceptance for publication, to be made publicly available no later than 12 months after the official date of publication...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Right now many of the most important papers on climate change, mass extinction and so on appear in &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;, where ordinary people can&#039;t get to them.  

Unfortunately it seems that the National Science Foundation is not moving to copy the National Institutes of Health; the journals have been fighting hard to prevent such a move.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The line that gets me is &quot;we call upon all leaders of the 21st century to exercise a collective responsibility of planetary stewardship&quot;.

Even in fiercely anti-democratic imperial China the Emperor could only go so far in defiance of public opinion without losing the mandate of heaven.

The people might not understand the arguments but they understand that the people running the investigation have the mathematical skills needed to evaluate the points of both sides.

Reproductive health is a large and complex topic. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_health&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Just two aspects:&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Reduction of maternal mortality:&lt;/b&gt; A reduction of maternal mortality rates and a narrowing of disparities in maternal mortality within countries and between geographical regions, socio-economic and ethnic groups.

&lt;b&gt;Access to reproductive and sexual health services including family planning:&lt;/b&gt; Family planning counseling, pre-natal care, safe delivery and post-natal care, prevention and appropriate treatment of infertility, prevention of abortion and the management of the consequences of abortion, treatment of reproductive tract infections, sexually transmitted diseases and other reproductive health conditions; and education, counseling, as appropriate, on human sexuality, reproductive health and responsible parenthood. Services regarding HIV/AIDS, breast cancer, infertility, delivery, hormone therapy, sex reassignment therapy, and abortion should be made available. Active discouragement of female genital mutilation (FGM).

Having read a little further... I have to complain about the second half of II.6: &quot;access to reproductive health services, education, and credit&quot; (what&#039;s the &quot;and credit&quot;, btw?) --- in this context, &quot;reproductive health services&quot; strikes me as something between euphemism and oxymoron.  At best, the proposal is to provide a personal escape from natural consequences while still encouraging intemperate habits --- burning the candle at both ends, if you will, or running to stand still, &lt;i&gt;and unnecessarily&lt;/i&gt;.

Just so you understand where I&#039;m coming from, I&#039;m a Catholic who loves my Church&#039;s ancient tradition and constant teaching; notably, believing that people &lt;i&gt;are naturally capable&lt;/i&gt; of self-control and virtuous behaviour, given the right encouragement.  You needn&#039;t be Christian of any sort, of course, to agree with those propositions.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My only complaint at the moment is the measure the Symposium gives to describe extreme poverty: to &quot;live on less than 2$ per day&quot;. Without wishing to blur the undeniable &lt;b&gt;fact&lt;/b&gt; that people live in extreme poverty, the cash drain that is &lt;i&gt;living&lt;/i&gt; in certain regions is not a useful measure of that poverty: instead it means that, on average, folk from the prosperous west wouldn&#039;t willingly move into such living conditions, even if it meant their expenses were reduced to only 2$ a day.

A more useful measure of poverty would be the balance of labour needed to live vs. the accessible food supporting that labour; or the accessibility of sound housing suitable to local climate and geology.]]></description>

My point is that they are using the Nobel Laureate name to add weight and importance to the symposium when in fact from approximately 280 living Nobel Laureates they were unable to attract 25 and had to make do with just 13. There were 267 Nobel Laureates that found more important things to do on those dates.]]></description>
