Good points!  Storm surges are very erratic compared to the gradual rise of sea level, so they&#039;re harder to predict, but it seems that they&#039;re destroying low-lying areas first... at least in the places I know. So, we should focus on them.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Another thing to keep in mind is that storm surges destroy infrastructure, so that long before the sea level premanently floods a neighborhood, the neighborhood has been destroyed in a hurricane.   See the images of Hurricane Sandy (2012).    The governor of New York has offered to buy out homes in destroyed neighborhoods at prehurricane prices but is not mandating that people move.    After the next hurricane one can expect a similar offer with houses at a much lower real estate value.    This beach and waterfront land would then become state park land and a flood zone.     

As for Manhattan, much of the endangered land is on landfill already and one could raise the walls around these areas higher (or insist the next developments fill in the ground level significantly higher.    It makes no sense that Battery Park City was built so close to water level, when an extra ten to twenty feet of above sea level land fill could have been used.    Now people are more aware that future landfill needs to be done higher.  Nevertheless apartments in Battery Park City go for millions of dollars.]]></description>

In a time of long past peak oil, such as 30 years from now, unless people/corps/governments decide to build lots of thorium nuclear reactors or find another equally productive energy technology, the carrying capacity of Nassau and Suffolk Counties will drop sharply, along with their populations, and the aquifers will get a chance to recharge.

Are there differences?   Is the Netherlands still able to drain its land at low tide, for example?    Is the real problem in the offing one that even the Netherlands will no longer be able to hold back?   

Is there also various scale changes for the US cost?    Are there several major river systems to elevate  or re-engineer?    Is there an extraordinarily long and highly complex shoreline, with much of our most valuable real estate, to either move or wall in?    

I think the gigantic economic problems, not the theoretical ones, are the real difficulty.   Abandoning what&#039;ll get wet and building some more sophisticated sustainable habitat seems definitely the low cost scheme to me.    

My being an architect with a lifetime of experience with building and development problems doesn&#039;t make my hunches certain of course, but that&#039;s my hunch of what will happen.   I&#039;m assuming that when people get down to having to spend real money for this stuff they&#039;ll realize that the 200 year plan has to be for 30 or 40 feet of ocean rise, something like that, and that it would be dumb to spend the money twice.]]></description>

Re: waterproof barrier -- see link above about Holland.

Perhaps you could supply us with an economic model that uses ever accelerating &lt;b&gt;decreases&lt;/b&gt; in energy. Numbers please. A spreadsheet would be nice.

With respect to shoreline development -- Currently the world&#039;s most valuable property is along the shore because of its beauty, recreation potential and ... commercial use especially transportation and industries that depend on transportation. The most efficient mode of freight transportation is rail and the second most efficient is marine. The shore is where the two meet -- trains can&#039;t operate on water and boats require it.

Are you telling us that it would be more economical to move all the current shoreline development inland than to raise the breakwall a meter or two? 

If you examine the shoreline of Manhattan or any other commercial area you&#039;ll see seawalls and various other barriers that keep the water out and the land in. Building them three feet taller to further protect the commercial development behind them should be a financial no-brainer.

And then we have the recent spate of land &quot;reclaimed&quot; from the oceans for commercial use. For example ...
&lt;blockquote&gt;Hong Kong International Airport was built on a large artificial island, formed by levelling Chek Lap Kok and Lam Chau islands (3.02 km² and 0.08 km² respectively), and reclaiming 9.38 km² of the adjacent seabed. The 12.48 km² airport site added nearly 1% to Hong Kong&#039;s total surface area, connecting to the north side of Lantau Island near Tung Chung new town.

The Netherlands is a geographically low-lying country, with about 25% of its area and 21% of its population located below sea level and 50% of its land lying less than one metre above sea level. Significant land area has been gained through land reclamation and preserved through an elaborate system of polders and dikes.

Thanks for the clarification.  140 deaths per year from flash floods in NYC &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; seem amazingly high.  I wonder how many there actually are, there, on average. 1?

Yes, HTML tags are supported in comments; that&#039;s how people make nice links, boldface, italics, quotes, etcetera.  Unfortunately I&#039;m the only person who can include images in comments: presumably that&#039;s some sort of anti-advertising measure on the part of Wordpress.]]></description>
