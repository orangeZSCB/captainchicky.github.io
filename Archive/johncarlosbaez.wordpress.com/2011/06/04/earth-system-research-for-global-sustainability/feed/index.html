Do they already have people working on concepts on how to get people involved?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Good question&#8212;I don&#039;t know.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
 So far it’s all about good intentions but no concrete plans to do something :-)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Right, but that&#039;s a good time to try to exert some influence.

Since the IMU is a prestigious organization&#8212;an invitation to speak at the International Congress of Mathematicians is sort of the &lt;i&gt;definition&lt;/i&gt; of &#039;prestige&#039; in mathematics&#8212;I&#039;m sure they can succeed in getting something done, even if it&#039;s only having talks on &#039;math and sustainability&#039;.  

Actually the IMU seems to be riding on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.icsu.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ICSU&#039;s&lt;/a&gt; coat-tails here, since it&#039;s really the ICSU that is &quot;starting a new 10-year research initiative: EARTH SYSTEM RESEARCH FOR GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY&quot; and will have a &quot;a strong scientific presence at the next United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uncsd2012.org/rio20/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Rio+20&lt;/a&gt;) that will take place on June 4-6, 2012 in Rio de Janeiro.&quot;  It&#039;s mainly other scientists that are doing things here.  Perhaps the mathematicians are just starting to figure out how to get involved.]]></description>

I would like to get involved somehow, but I’m not exactly sure how.

Do they already have people working on concepts on how to get people involved? So far it&#039;s all about good intentions but no concrete plans to do something :-)

BTW, after the interview with Tim Palmer about stochastic methods in climate science I subscribed to an email list that was mentioned somewhere by somebody, and received a job notification today:
&lt;blockquote&gt;

The Mathematical Institute in Oxford, through the Oxford Centre for Collaborative Applied Mathematics (OCCAM) is currently inviting applications for a 2-year PDRA position for research into &#039;Stochastic Closures for Weather and Climate&#039;. This research will involve a mix of mathematical modelling, numerical analysis, stochastic analysis and collaboration with climate scientists.

The details can be found at:
