					<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s an example of a terrorist plot that got caught.  It illustrates what seems to be a very basic point that doesn&#039;t require &#039;Erdős–Rényi random graphs&#039; or &#039;percolation thresholds&#039; to understand: &lt;i&gt;the bigger a conspiracy, the more likely it is to get caught&lt;/i&gt;.  The more people are involved, the greater the chance that a small mistake will occur.

&#8226; Carrie Johnson, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/2011/06/15/137181477/hearing-to-examine-terrorist-recruitment-in-prisons&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Hearing to examine terrorist recruitment in prisons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Morning Edition&lt;/i&gt;, National Public Radio, 15 June 2011.

&lt;blockquote&gt;

Six years ago, police swooped into a Los Angeles-area apartment building and arrested two men. Authorities said the men were on the verge of attacking synagogues and U.S. military recruiting stations. FBI and Justice Department sources call it the most serious domestic terrorist threat since the Sept. 11 attacks.

The leader, Kevin James, orchestrated the plot from inside California&#039;s New Folsom Prison, where he was locked up for armed robberies he committed as a member of the Crips gang.

Mark Hamm, who teaches criminology at Indiana State University, studied the case and interviewed dozens of inmates all over the country.

&quot;This is fairly remarkable, that you can send somebody to a maximum security prison and while behind bars they can still wage a terrorist attack,&quot; Hamm says.

Right under the noses of California prison officials, James had directed a fellow inmate about to win parole to find people with clean records and an understated demeanor to help carry out a spectacular attack. James gave his colleagues a written blueprint to carry with them.

The men robbed several gas stations to get money to fund their plot. Then, authorities got lucky: One of the robbers dropped his cellphone, leading police to their apartment.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Of course it&#039;s obviously dumb to use bank robberies to fund a terrorist attack, unless there&#039;s no other way.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree John with your final conclusion. But you can also do this in Sage:

10 is the number of vertices
0.2 is the fixed probability p

g = graphs.RandomGNP(10,0.2)
# this returns order of graph(largest click) and the list of clicks
g.clique_number(), g.cliques()

one test run:

(4, [[6, 0, 5, 3], [6, 0, 7, 3], [6, 0, 7, 4], [6, 0, 7, 8], [6, 1, 2], [6, 2, 4], [6, 2, 5], [6, 2, 8], [9, 0, 3], [9, 0, 4], [9, 0, 8], [9, 1, 2], [9, 2, 4], [9, 2, 8]])]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Understanding distributions like this is much easier from the point-of-view of simple dispersion following a growth function such as a diminishing return learning curve model. For scientific citation links the agreement is remarkable:
http://img807.imageshack.us/img807/9771/scicitations.gif
It also works pretty well for web links
http://img812.imageshack.us/img812/7305/weblinks.gif
A learning curve model is essentially the growth model:
dg/dt = k/g
which says that growth is very easy to come by initially but slows down inversely proportional to the cumulative growth.  Maximum entropy dispersion is then applied to the growth rate proportionality constant and also to overall effort expended. This is so simple to explain yet I haven&#039;t seen this behavior referenced anywhere.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Maybe I should mention that one central point of the pro-contra nuclear power debate in Germany was that the companies who operate the power plants were unable to get a full coverage insurance for the plants, for foreseeable incidents like a plane crash.

This put politicians in an awkward position who had to explain why the plants are perfectly safe, while no private insurance company was willing to sign an insurance contract. This was especially aggravating for some people after the big financial crisis: &quot;And again the profits go to the big companies why the taxpayer has to cover all the risks!&quot;]]></description>
