					<description><![CDATA[And as an aside, knowing your fondness for the number 24,  consider the equation:
Summation on i from 0 to 4 operating on {2^i mod3 times binary coefficient (4, i)} = 24.

The terms are 1 + 8 + 6 + 8 + 1. Break the 8&#039;s in half to get two 4&#039;s each and you get the 7 conjugacy classes of the binary tetrahedral group, of order 24; the mod3 coming from the fact that the binary tetrahedral group is isomorphic to SL(2,3).

The joy and mystery of mathematics!]]></description>

And as an addendum to the above, it&#039;s worth pointing out that within this tableau formalism one can take the purely antisymmetric vertical boxes to be the double stranded couples A/T &#038; C/G; and moreover the 3 box mixed states, symmetrized along a strand and antisymmetrized across a strand, form what I refer to as a binary codon core,  with some interesting relations among themselves as well, and give some insight into what a binary genetic code might have looked like back in the day. Also, using hook length, one can determine the dimension of these various representations, and through a product rule generate higher dimensional reps - potentially generating entire proteins. I know, some hand waving there! But interesting.

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/04/14/the-genetic-code/#comment-164462&quot;&gt;John Baez&lt;/a&gt;.

Begin with just the symmetric numbering of 3 boxes over 4 elements i.e. (111), (112), (113),(114),(122),(123),(124),(133),(134),(144),(222),(223),(224),(233),(234),(244),(333),(334),(344),(444). Notice there are 20. Now consider the 24 (4! ) combinations which permute the number assignments and allow A, G, C, T to take any number from one to four. Therein one finds a unique linear combination of 4 number assignments which renders at least one occurrence of each of the 20 AAs in our genetic code. Plus the stops. 
Kind of cool to play around with! There&#039;s a number of symmetries that show up between A and T and C and G. Also, it&#039;s interesting to note that although the masses of the nucleotides are all quite different, the mass of A+T = C+G to within 1%.

					<description><![CDATA[Sort of related to this: &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2011/05/unnatural-amino-acids-combine-with-hgh-to-make-for-better-therapy.ars&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this news report&lt;/a&gt; says that other amino acids (outside the 20) can be added to proteins changing some of their biochemical properties. (This particular example appears to be &quot;weighing down&quot; a molecule so that it gets processed by the kidneys slower, enabling more of the biologically active part to be processed.) So this suggests that it&#039;s not the case that simply &quot;there are 20 worthwhile amino acids, so evolution figured out how to code for that 20&quot; but that it&#039;s as much a decision to have 20 synthesisable amino acids as the decision how to represent them.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/04/14/the-genetic-code/#comment-5328&quot;&gt;Graham&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks for all the answers, Graham!  

I think frame shifts are really cool.  For those not in the know, this is the idea: when reading DNA to create proteins, the cell reads 3 bases at a time and turns each 3-letter &#039;word&#039; into an amino acid, as sketched in this blog entry.  So, if a mistake happens and the cell starts reading 1 or 2 or 2 base pairs down from where it should, a completely different protein is made.   For example,

ATA CCG CGA TCC ...

may become:

TAC CGC GAT CC...

And this can cause nasty diseases like Tay-Sachs.  

But life, being the wonderfully flexible thing it is, has also figured out ways to exploit this possibility to its advantage!  The same stretch of DNA can be &lt;i&gt;deliberately&lt;/i&gt; read in 3 different ways to create different proteins!  

For example, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12588970&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;hepatitis C virus does this&lt;/a&gt;.  A relevant buzzword is &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translational_frameshift#Controlling_mechanisms&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;translational frameshift&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>
