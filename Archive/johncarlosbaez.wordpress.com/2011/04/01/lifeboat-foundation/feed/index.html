You&#039;re mixing together some rather different entities. Discovery Institute are creationists. Extropy Institute are transhumanists. Tech Central Station was a corporate-friendly technology news-site.

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/04/01/lifeboat-foundation/#comment-5038&quot;&gt;John Baez&lt;/a&gt;.

I checked out the NRC&#039;s report (at http://e-drexler.com/d/06/00/NRC_molecular_manufacturing_report.pdf) on Drexler&#039;s &quot;Productive Nanosystems&quot; ideas, and found this conclusive paragraph:

&quot;The committee found the evaluation of the feasibility of these ideas to be difficult because of the lack of experimental demonstrations of many of the key underlying concepts. The technical arguments make use of accepted scientific knowledge but constitute a “theoretical analysis demonstrating the possibility of a class of as-yet unrealizable devices.”22 Thus, this work is currently outside the mainstream of both conventional science (designed to seek new knowledge) and conventional engineering (usually concerned with the design of things that can be built more or less immediately). Rather, it may be in the tradition of visionary engineering analysis exemplified by Konstantin Tsiolkovski’s 1903 publication, “The Exploration of Cosmic Space by Means of Reaction Devices,”23 and today’s studies of “space elevators” based on hypothetical carbon nanotube composite materials.24
Construction of extended structures with three-dimensional covalent bonding may be easy to conceive and might be readily accomplished, but only by using tools that do not yet exist.25 In other words, the tool structures and other components cannot yet be built, but they can be computationally modeled. Modeling the thermodynamic stability of a structure (showing that it can, in principle, exist) does not tell one how to build it, and these arguments do not yet constitute a research strategy or a research plan.&quot; NRC Report at p107.

I had a look at the Youtube video presentation for &quot;Productive Nanosystems&quot;, at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEYN18d7gHg

and it&#039;s pretty obvious that it&#039;s got to run at absolute zero and in a perfect vacuum in order to maintain the precise positional placement required for its functioning. 

Moreover, the video posits the use of acetylene as a starting material and going through a number of steps to the final product, which is apparently a laptop computer with 100 billion CPUs amongst other features, apparently built from acetylene only, with warm air and pure water as side products.

The first step in the manufacturing process is to create a stream of 100% pure acetylene (H-C-C-H) molecules, which are linear, and roughly 3 Angstroms long. Somehow, the other components of air, such as hydrogen, H-H, oxygen, O=O, and nitrogen, N=N, both of the latter with lone pairs of electrons, carbon dioxide, O=C=O, with lone pairs on the oxygen atoms, and monatomic species such as argon, are filtered out by size, even though carbon dioxide is longer than acetylene and monatomic noble gases are much smaller (and quite unreactive). I could see how the carbon dioxide might be filtered out, but not the oxygen or nitrogen which are similar in size or the argon which is much smaller. I assume the stream of reactant is 100% dry so no water is present. After filtration, supposedly we have pure acetylene somehow, and the next step is to adsorb it, one molecule at a time, on a diamondoid &quot;tip&quot;, placed thereon by some kind of metallic structure which will adsorb acetylene when required and will de-adsorb acetylene when required for deposition on the tip, where it stays and does not fall off or move, without bonding to the diamondoid structure. One more requirement - there can&#039;t be &lt;b&gt;any&lt;/b&gt; mechanical vibration of the assembler device - temperature control has to be absolute, and there has to be absolute seismic damping.

OK, so the acetylene molecule is parked on the tip, and then a arm comes down and plucks a &quot;hydrogen atom&quot; from either end of the acetylene molecule. Now there&#039;s a choice - you&#039;re breaking a covalent bond and taking the hydrogens off as radicals, leaving an acetylene biradical in place, or you&#039;re pulling off two protons, and leaving an acetylene dianion, or perhaps a radical on one end and a proton on the other, making an acetylene radical anion. 

Now you&#039;re in trouble, because you&#039;ve just made an extremely reactive molecule. Acetylene biradicals combine with diamondoid structures to make more diamondoid structure (see &quot;Insights into the Growth of (Ultra)nanocrystalline Diamond by Combined Molecular Dynamics and Monte Carlo Simulations&quot;, Eckert et al., Cryst. Growth Des., 2010, 10 (7), pp 3005–3021.) or with each other to make polyethylene (&quot;Chemisorption of C2 Biradical and Acetylene on Reconstructed Diamond(111)-(2 × 1)&quot;, Yang et al., J. Phys. Chem. B, 2003, 107 (4), pp 985–993.)

Conceivably, if N=N and O=O have passed through the filter, the biradical could form lots of interesting and useless side products with those molecules as well.

Computer simulation is interesting and can produce tantalizing results, but you have to be aware of the limitations of the model, and the assumptions which simplify actual physical reality into something which can be computed within reasonable time. For molecular mechanics models such as Drexler uses, you have to know about their parameterization as well. If he&#039;s using ab initio methods, you have to know the level of theory he&#039;s using, and the assumptions therein. Calculations are not perfect, they can predict results which are not correct, or are not realizable in real physical systems.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt; ... Drexler conceded that he would be using aqueous chemistry in producing nanomachines – and in such an environment, the highly-strained systems which he proposes would most probably react with solvent ....
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Drexler is well aware that his diamondoid nanomachine proposals require vacuum (or possibly, inert noble gases), and possibly low temperatures, to operate and to be built, due to highly reactive structures (especially intermediate structures). His proposals for machines operating in water are not about the same machines &#8212; those would be built of biotechnology-derived components compatible with water (e.g. using DNA Origami). Those could be used to assemble tough polymeric structures in water which retain their structure out of water, as one of several stages of machinery building a different kind of machinery, before diamondoid machines could be built.

Related topics are discussed extensively in his book &lt;a href=&quot;http://e-drexler.com/d/06/00/Nanosystems/toc.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Nanosystems&lt;/a&gt; and in various articles on his website and blog. I&#039;m sure you can find there answers to the most common objections to his proposals.

Right.  My reason for avoiding politics on this blog is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; that I think it&#039;s unimportant.  It&#039;s very important, and unavoidably so.  However, discussions of politics tend to stir up strong passions that would disrupt the friendly scientific conversations I&#039;m trying to have here.  I would have to work very hard to keep people from fighting each other, and I don&#039;t have the energy.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Where one would go to discuss and debate such things is unknown to me; I know of no neutral ground not sponsored by one stake-holder or another, which inherently if not explicitly biases debate in favor of the stake-holder.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I haven&#039;t spent a lot of time looking for well-run neutral forums to discuss politics, so they could exist without me knowing it.

But clearly, running such a thing well would take a profound sense of fairness, a huge amount of energy, and constant self-discipline.  One would need to set up intelligently chosen ground rules and enforce them consistently, without getting pulled into taking sides.  Since politics inherently pushes people toward taking sides, this would be very hard&#8212;just as maintaining a well-run democracy is hard. 

I don&#039;t have what it takes to run such a forum.  So, I&#039;ve opted to run a forum where politics is off limits and I regularly give everyone a shower of ice-cold mathematics to keep passions from heating up.  This is in the tradition of earlier forums I helped start, &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/sci.physics.research/topics&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;sci.physics.research&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-Category Caf&#233;&lt;/a&gt;.  I needed all the practice I got at those places to do what I&#039;m doing now, because environmental issues make people angrier than mathematics or even physics (where people get a lot more worked up than you might guess).     

I don&#039;t claim that what I&#039;m doing now is the world needs most, but it&#039;s something I can do.]]></description>

Since politics inherently pushes people toward taking sides, this would be very hard&mdash;just as maintaining a well-run democracy is hard. </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have what it takes to run such a forum.  So, I&#8217;ve opted to run a forum where politics is off limits and I regularly give everyone a shower of ice-cold mathematics to keep passions from heating up.  This is in the tradition of earlier forums I helped start, <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/sci.physics.research/topics" rel="nofollow">sci.physics.research</a> and the <a href="http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/" rel="nofollow"><i>n</i>-Category Caf&eacute;</a>.  I needed all the practice I got at those places to do what I&#8217;m doing now, because environmental issues make people angrier than mathematics or even physics (where people get a lot more worked up than you might guess).     </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t claim that what I&#8217;m doing now is the world needs most, but it&#8217;s something I can do.</p>

I&#039;ve read the article by Otavio Bueno on the Drexler-Smalley debate, and there&#039;s a footnote which gets to the point, sort of:

&quot;Of course, Drexler has actually not constructed a molecular assembler. The question of the possibility of constructing such a device would be irrelevant if the device had already been constructed. It is enough for Drexler’s purpose to establish the theoretical possibility of such a construction, sketching how it could be performed in principle. If no known physical and chemical laws are violated in the construction, the resulting process is, at least, theoretically possible – even though we may not have the slightest idea of how to implement the process and thus actually construct the assembler.&quot; 

The calculations done by Drexler to construct his model were performed with a molecular modeling program, MM-2, which models molecules as if they were in absolute vacuum and at absolute zero temperature. At some point in the Bueno article, Drexler conceded that he would be using aqueous chemistry in producing nanomachines - and in such an environment, the highly-strained systems which he proposes would most probably react with solvent or solvated particles or gases (such as oxygen) in order to relieve the strain. Highly strained organic molecules are highly reactive organic molecules. Drexler&#039;s ideas seem to me to be more likely to result in black tar rather than grey goo - all it takes is for a &lt;b&gt;single&lt;/b&gt; bond in one of his nanomachines to react with solvent or dissolved gas, and then that nanomachine is permanently disabled - with no means for repair. Nanochemistry has been done, it&#039;s just my opinion that Drexler&#039;s version of it will prove to be impossible to achieve in real life.]]></description>

If &quot;social dynamics&quot; play a crucial role in determining risks and responses, then politics must eventually come into play. 

Unless there is a universally-held ethical standard which trumps all monetary or other power interests and which forecloses all choices other than the &quot;right&quot; choice, then competition between those with differing interests will happen, and the greater the amount of money or power involved, the greater the amount of controversy. 

It&#039;s the difference between absolutist rule and either direct or republican democracy. Given this, it&#039;s a good idea to debate such things, and even necessary, if ignorance comes with great peril. Where one would go to discuss and debate such things is unknown to me; I know of no neutral ground not sponsored by one stake-holder or another, which inherently if not explicitly biases debate in favor of the stake-holder.]]></description>

Sorry, Webhubtel&#8212;your 7:15 post was misclassified as spam, and I just rescued it now.

Thanks for the information about the Foresight Institute.  I&#039;ll check it out if I ever need to make some decision involving them.

I hope to interview Eric Drexler for &lt;i&gt;This Week&#039;s Finds&lt;/i&gt; someday.  Then you can ask him if he was indeed &quot;crushed&quot;.  &lt;img src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/emoticons/tongue2.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I erred on the safe side. I thought you wanted to keep politics out of this site and the best way is to avoid linking to other sites with a possible agenda. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thanks.  Of course what I want most of all is to avoid the aggressive tribalism that seems to emerge whenever people talk about politics: their IQ&#039;s seem to drop as they line up for battle.   

I&#039;m very interested in understanding the agenda of any person or organization I might deal with, but it&#039;s hard to talk about the details without pissing people off, so I prefer in general to focus here on scientific questions.  This post of mine was pushing the boundaries I&#039;ve set for myself, but I think it was worthwhile, because (so far) we seem to have learned some interesting things without getting into a big fight.]]></description>

Interesting analysis.  How would we square that with the &quot;Trojan Horse&quot; idea?  Did the Trojan Horse get taken over by the Trojans?  Or have the Trojans been successfully fooled?

The social dynamics play a crucial role in determining both the risks of technologies and our responses to them.  Anyone who ignores that stuff, does so at great peril.]]></description>
