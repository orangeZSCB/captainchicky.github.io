It turns out that the tellurium-iodine glitched caused quite a lot of hand-wringing!  Here&#039;s a quote from:

&#8226; Joseph William Mellor, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/joseph-william-mellor/a-comprehensive-treatise-on-inorganic-and-theoretical-chemistry-volume-1-hci/page-45-.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;A Comprehensive Treatise on Inorganic and Theoretical Chemistry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, Vol. 1, page 45.

which is part of a 16-volume book published perhaps sometime around 1922.  Emphasis mine:

&lt;blockquote&gt; 
G. Kr&#252;ss and F. W. Schmidt (1889)  attributed the difficulty with cobalt and nickel to the presence of a hitherto undiscovered element in nickel which they named gnomium. This explanation, however, had to be discarded. It did not survive the ordeal remorselessly applied to conjectures of this kind. No gnomium has yet been found. 

Again, the case of iodine and tellurium has been studied with relentless vigour stimulated largely by D. I. Mendeleeff&#039;s prediction: &quot;The atomic weight of tellurium must be between 123 and 126, and cannot be 128.&quot; Iodine most certainly belongs to the same group as the other halogens, and tellurium undoubtedly belongs to the selenium group; these elements are accordingly placed among their own family relations in spite of the fact that if their atomic weights were alone considered tellurium would be ranked with the halogens, and iodine with selenium. 

B. Brauner (1889) suggested that ordinary tellurium is a complex containing a- and jS-tellurium; and it was inferred that true tellurium say a-Te has an atomic weight 125, and that the other form of this element has a higher atomic weight, and will find a place in the periodic system in the valency below tellurium. D. I. Mendeleeff cafled this undiscovered element dwi-tellurium, Dt, and he sketched some of its physical and chemical properties; but &lt;b&gt;tellurium, said G. Wyrouboff, has been tortured in every conceivable manner: it has been melted, sublimed, oxidized, hydrogenized, phenylated, dissolved, crystallized, fractioned, and precipitated; yet nothing but failure has followed all attempts to get an atomic weight lower than iodine or to fraction the element into two others&lt;/b&gt;. 

Nothing has developed which would warrant a belief in Mendeleeff&#039;s &quot;must.&quot; Hence, in spite of the fact that &quot;the laws of nature admit of no exception,&quot; faith in the law has led chemists to allocate these discordant elements according to their chemical properties and not according to their atomic weights. 

To put the matter bluntly, the procedure runs: It is necessary either to reject the periodic law or to reject the number 127.5 for tellurium; the periodic law cannot be rejected because it is the very embodiment of truth, nay, truth itself; ergo, in spite of all evidence to the contrary, the number 127.5 must be wrong. 


Bode&#039;s law of astronomy successfully predicted the asteroids and allocated their proper place in the solar system; but the subsequent discovery of Neptune did not agree with Bode&#039;s law. The law was accordingly abandoned and it is now regarded as a curiosity. Mendeleeff&#039;s law may have to go the same way.  B. Brauner&#039;s assumption that tellurium is a mixture of true tellurium with a higher homologue, may be a good working hypothesis for stimulating experiments on this element, but to maintain the thesis against all evidence to the contrary &quot;may afford an easier way out of the difficulty than by working steadily at the cause of the discrepancy, but it affords at best a feeble and undignified cover for one&#039;s retreat.&quot; This method must be dubbed unscientific, but the circumstantial evidence justifies the procedure in the expectation that a consistent system will ultimately grow from the truth and error engrafted into the &quot;law.&quot; It is not very probable that the principle underlying the periodic law will be abandoned because it is founded on a vast assemblage of facts of different kinds; and because it seems to be plastic enough to fulfil subsequent requirements. 

The central problem in inorganic chemistry, said W. Ramsay (1904), is to answer the question: Why this incomplete concordance? 

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And of course the answer was to understand nuclear physics.]]></description>

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since nobody seems to be trying this puzzle, I think I&#039;ll answer it before I forget to fix the Wikipedia article!

There&#039;s a &#039;glitch&#039;: the atomic weight of cobalt is higher than that of nickel.  And I said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In 1889, Gerhard Krüss and F. W.

For reasons that should be obvious by now, they named this proposed element &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;gnomium!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That doesn&#039;t make sense!  Either we need gnomium to be very similar to cobalt but heavier than nickel,... or very similar to nickel but lighter than cobalt.

It took me surprisingly long to notice this mistake.  I got it from &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnomium&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

A theoretical solution would have been an element, very similar and nearly inseparable from cobalt, but with a lower atomic weight, so that its mixture with cobalt would be lighter than nickel.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Is gnomium like cobalt but heavier, or like nickel but lighter?  Luckily, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wordnik.com/words/gnomium&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wordnik&lt;/a&gt; breaks the tie:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

In chem., a supposed new metal having a high atomic weight, which Krüss announced in 1892 as associated with nickel and cobalt, and the presence of which he believed to be the cause of the assignment of too high a value to the atomic weight of cobalt. It has been shown that the supposed discovery was an error.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So, now I&#039;ve fixed the Wikipedia entry...

Oh, okay!  

(This is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; the thing I said that does not make sense.)

Maybe I once knew about the potassium-argon glitch, or maybe I&#039;m just vaguely remembering the fact that radioactive potassium decays into argon.

I wonder if the glitches you mention created as much puzzlement as the cobalt-nickel glitch.   A curious extra twist in that glitch lies in the fact that cobalt and nickel are &lt;i&gt;chemically similar&lt;/i&gt;, unlike the pairs you mention.

The argon-potassium glitch must have been discovered later.   Argon was only isolated in 1894 (by Lord Rayleigh and Sir William Ramsay), though its existence had been suspected for a long time.  

I see that tellurium was discovered in the 1780s, and iodine in 1811, but I have no idea when their atomic weights were measured with enough accuracy to note a glitch.

&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tellurium&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Tellurium&lt;/a&gt; was sufficiently confusing that its discoverer called it &lt;i&gt;aurum paradoxium&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;metallum problematicum&lt;/i&gt;.

Ah, for the good old days, when there were plenty of elements left to discover.  And plenty of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Misidentified_chemical_elements&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;false ones&lt;/a&gt;, too.  I&#039;d known about nebulium and coronium as a kid, and my beloved CRC handbook included charmingly obsolete isotope names like mesothorium, radiothorium, brevium and thoron.  But only now, thanks to Wikipedia, did I learn about carolinium, pelopium, hesperium, sequanium...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thorbear and Florifulgurator solved the puzzle!  I guess it takes a mythological being to find a nonexistent element named after a mischievous sprite!

After nickel and cobalt, the third element named after a mischievous underground sprite is &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnomium&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;gnomium!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

The problem is that while:

&#8226; iron has 26 protons, 
&#8226; cobalt has 27 and 
&#8226; nickel has 28,

the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_weight&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;atomic weights&lt;/a&gt; of these elements don&#039;t rise along with the number of protons:

&#8226; the atomic weight of iron is 55.845,
&#8226; the atomic weight of cobalt is 58.9331,
&#8226; that nickel of is 58.6934.

As far as I know, this is the only place in the periodic table where such a &#039;glitch&#039; occurs!

What causes it?  Since the weight comes from both protons and neutrons, you&#039;ll want to know how many protons &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; neutrons these elements have.  This depends on which isotope we&#039;re talking about:

&#8226; the most common isotope of iron has 56 protons and neutrons.  (About 92% of iron on Earth is &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron-56&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;iron-56&lt;/a&gt;.)

&#8226; the only stable isotope of cobalt has 59 protons and neutrons.  (All the cobalt on Earth is &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopes_of_cobalt&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;cobalt-59&lt;/a&gt;.)

&#8226; the most common isotope of nickel has 58 protons and neutrons.  (68% of nickel on Earth is &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel-58&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;nickel-58&lt;/a&gt;, but 26% is &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel-62&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;nickel-62&lt;/a&gt;, and other isotopes are also present.)

As you can see, the most common isotope of nickel has fewer protons and neutrons than the most common isotope of cobalt!  That&#039;s &lt;i&gt;part&lt;/i&gt; of the explanation, but it&#039;s more complicated than that.  

First, the atomic weight is the &lt;i&gt;average&lt;/i&gt; weight, averaged over different isotopes according to how common they are: so, nickel&#039;s atomic weight is pushed up by the large amount of nickel-62 on Earth.  

Second, the atomic weight is not just the sum of the weights of the protons and electrons; thanks to E = mc&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, we must also subtract the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_binding_energy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;binding energy&lt;/a&gt; divided by the square of the speed of light.  The binding energy is how much energy it takes to pull the nucleus apart into separate nucleons (protons and neutrons).   Iron, cobalt and nickel have among the highest binding energies per nucleon of all elements:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Binding_energy_curve_-_common_isotopes.svg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Binding_energy_curve_-_common_isotopes.svg/500px-Binding_energy_curve_-_common_isotopes.svg.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Here&#039;s a deeper puzzle: &lt;b&gt;Is it a coincidence that the glitch in atomic weights happens near the peak of the binding energy curve, or not?&lt;/b&gt;   

I honestly don&#039;t know.  

Anyway, in the late 1800&#039;s, scientists noticed this glitch in the periodic table.  At first they blamed the problem on errors in the measured atomic weights.  But after the atomic weights of cobalt and nickel were established more precisely, the contradiction remained.  

To understand the situation, you should remember that neutrons and protons were not known at this time, nor even the fact that atoms have nuclei: atomic weight was a mystery.

In 1889, Gerhard Krüss and F. W. Schmidt proposed a solution to the problem: an element, very similar and very hard to separate from cobalt, but with a lower atomic weight, so that its mixture with cobalt would be lighter than nickel. For reasons that should be obvious by now, they named this proposed element &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;gnomium!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

&#8226;  Gerhard Krüss and F. W. Schmidt, Ein neues Element, welches neben Kobalt und Nickel vorkommt, &lt;i&gt;Zeitschrift für Analytische Chemie&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;28&lt;/b&gt; (1889), 340.

Alas, it turned out not to exist.  &lt;img src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/emoticons/frown.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;

(And another small puzzle: &lt;b&gt;what portion of what I just said doesn&#039;t make sense?&lt;/b&gt;  I got it from a Wikipedia article.)]]></description>

<p>What causes it?  Since the weight comes from both protons and neutrons, you&#8217;ll want to know how many protons <i>and</i> neutrons these elements have.  This depends on which isotope we&#8217;re talking about:</p>
<p>&bull; the most common isotope of iron has 56 protons and neutrons.  (About 92% of iron on Earth is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron-56" rel="nofollow">iron-56</a>.)</p>
<p>&bull; the only stable isotope of cobalt has 59 protons and neutrons.  (All the cobalt on Earth is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopes_of_cobalt" rel="nofollow">cobalt-59</a>.)</p>
<p>&bull; the most common isotope of nickel has 58 protons and neutrons.  (68% of nickel on Earth is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel-58" rel="nofollow">nickel-58</a>, but 26% is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel-62" rel="nofollow">nickel-62</a>, and other isotopes are also present.)</p>
<p>As you can see, the most common isotope of nickel has fewer protons and neutrons than the most common isotope of cobalt!  That&#8217;s <i>part</i> of the explanation, but it&#8217;s more complicated than that.  </p>
<p>First, the atomic weight is the <i>average</i> weight, averaged over different isotopes according to how common they are: so, nickel&#8217;s atomic weight is pushed up by the large amount of nickel-62 on Earth.  </p>
<p>Second, the atomic weight is not just the sum of the weights of the protons and electrons; thanks to E = mc<sup></sup><sup>2</sup>, we must also subtract the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_binding_energy" rel="nofollow">binding energy</a> divided by the square of the speed of light.  The binding energy is how much energy it takes to pull the nucleus apart into separate nucleons (protons and neutrons).   Iron, cobalt and nickel have among the highest binding energies per nucleon of all elements:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Binding_energy_curve_-_common_isotopes.svg" rel="nofollow"><br />
<img width="450" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Binding_energy_curve_-_common_isotopes.svg/500px-Binding_energy_curve_-_common_isotopes.svg.png" /><br />
</a></div>
<p>Here&#8217;s a deeper puzzle: <b>Is it a coincidence that the glitch in atomic weights happens near the peak of the binding energy curve, or not?</b>   </p>
<p>I honestly don&#8217;t know.  </p>
<p>Anyway, in the late 1800&#8217;s, scientists noticed this glitch in the periodic table.  At first they blamed the problem on errors in the measured atomic weights.  But after the atomic weights of cobalt and nickel were established more precisely, the contradiction remained.  </p>
<p>To understand the situation, you should remember that neutrons and protons were not known at this time, nor even the fact that atoms have nuclei: atomic weight was a mystery.</p>
<p>In 1889, Gerhard Krüss and F. W. Schmidt proposed a solution to the problem: an element, very similar and very hard to separate from cobalt, but with a lower atomic weight, so that its mixture with cobalt would be lighter than nickel. For reasons that should be obvious by now, they named this proposed element <i><b>gnomium!</b></i></p>
<p>&bull;  Gerhard Krüss and F. W. Schmidt, Ein neues Element, welches neben Kobalt und Nickel vorkommt, <i>Zeitschrift für Analytische Chemie</i> <b>28</b> (1889), 340.</p>
<p>Alas, it turned out not to exist.  <img src="https://i2.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/emoticons/frown.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>(And another small puzzle: <b>what portion of what I just said doesn&#8217;t make sense?</b>  I got it from a Wikipedia article.)</p>

That&#039;s a moving story, John. 

On a different note, I&#039;ve realized that the reason why I couldn&#039;t solve your puzzle is that I was using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/darrencullen/5197315166/sizes/l/in/pool-41894168726@N01/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the wrong periodic table&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>

Gremlinium? Impium?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Close!  Much closer than you probably realize!]]></description>

Oh, now I understand why in the classic AD&#038;D computer game Baldur&#039;s Gate there are Kobolds that poison the iron in the iron mines of Nashkel. 

And of course I forgot to mention one of the most well known Kobolds, the Nachtmahr (English &quot;nightmare&quot;).

Unfortunately all this brainstorming did not help me to remember the third answer, I give up :-)]]></description>
