					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/04/13/the-three-fold-way/#comment-5279&quot;&gt;The Cosmist&lt;/a&gt;.

The Cosmist wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

Do you really think the mathematical tools of reductionist physics are going to be very useful in “green mathematics”? 

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Great question &#8212; I&#039;ll tell you at the end of this century!

&lt;blockquote&gt;

Doesn’t analysis of the complex systems encountered in biology, ecology etc. require more “green computing”, statistics, data mining and pure empiricism than anything else?

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It will certain require a lot of those things.  It will also require a lot of good new ideas.  And those ideas, if they&#039;re formulated with sufficient logical clarity and generality, may turn out to be &lt;i&gt;mathematics&lt;/i&gt;.

Two examples:

My friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://faculty.chemistry.ucla.edu/institution/personnel?personnel_id=45756&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Christopher Lee&lt;/a&gt; heads the Center for Computational Biology at UCLA.  He does heavy-duty data mining for genomics: for example, check out his &lt;a href=&quot;http://bioinfo.mbi.ucla.edu/HIV/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;analysis of HIV evolution and drug resistance from sequencing of 50,000 clinical AIDS patient samples.&lt;/a&gt; But his work involves lots of beautiful new math.  His new paper on &lt;a href=&quot;http://thinking.bioinformatics.ucla.edu/2011/02/02/empirical-information-metrics-paper-published/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;potential information metrics&lt;/a&gt; is a great example:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is common to measure the information value of a model as its average prediction power for some observable variable of interest. Then the absolute goodness-of-fit of a statistical model to a set of observations can be formulated as the total remaining information obtainable by the set of all models that we have not yet computed (one of which might fit the observations much better than our current model). In a paper just published in &lt;i&gt;Information&lt;/i&gt;, I define this metric as the potential information, and show that it can estimated directly from the observations, without actually computing any of the remaining models.

This addresses a simple question in Bayesian inference: &lt;i&gt;how do we know when we’re done?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another: check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~evans/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Steven N. Evans&lt;/a&gt;&#039; work on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www2.ims.nus.edu.sg/Programs/011mathbio/files/steven_tut_ppt.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;metagenomics and metrics on spaces of probability distributions&lt;/a&gt;. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In my limited experience, mathematical equations are of little use in modelling really complex real world systems...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I don&#039;t think of math as being primarily about equations.  While equations are certainly a big part of it, I&#039;d say math is really about noticing very general patterns, inventing definitions that help formalize these patterns, and reasoning with these definitions.  I&#039;ve published plenty of math papers where equations are not very important.  And sometimes the equations look like this:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fqxi.org/community/articles/display/141&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
&lt;img width=&quot;350&quot; src=&quot;http://www.fqxi.org/data/article-images/html/baez_category.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

(The left side equals the right; click for details&#8212;and thanks to Scott Carter for allowing me to use this picture.)  

So math is very flexible, and I think we&#039;ll continue to see it grow.  

&lt;blockquote&gt;
This is unfortunate, since reductionist math models were comprehensible and aesthetically pleasing, while “green mathematics” is probably going to be an ugly and incomprehensible mess — one best understood not by human minds, but by increasingly intelligent machines!
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The world is too complex for us to understand all of it, but that&#039;s okay: math is always about finding the beautiful pieces that we &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; understand.  There is something beautiful about this leaf, for example:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/leaf_closeup.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

And while we can&#039;t understand each individual vein, we may be able to understand the overall pattern.  See Qinglan Xia&#039;s paper &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/qlxia/Research/leaf.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The formation of a tree leaf&lt;/a&gt;, for a start.

So green mathematics may require careful judgement to separate the ugly and incomprehensible from the beautiful and comprehensible, and let humans focus on the latter while machines deal with the former.

Of course if the machines get intelligent enough, they may want to work on the beautiful part.  ]]></description>
