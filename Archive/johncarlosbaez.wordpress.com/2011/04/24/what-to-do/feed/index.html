You very probably know about that, but network theory is also often summarized under operations research - not quite in the sense as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gereports.com/the-doctor-will-see-you-on-the-assembly-line/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;operations like on assembly lines&lt;/a&gt; (interesting to know how they&#039;d operate on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gereports.com/the-doctor-will-see-you-on-the-assembly-line/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reactors&lt;/a&gt;) but in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;traditional sense&lt;/a&gt;.
I just mention this because sometimes one may slip some terms.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am quite new here, having only a cursory review of your blog I stumbled upon it by way of a link to the “Voynich Manuscript”. Nevertheless, I was quite intrigued by your curious conditional invitation: “If you want to help save the planet, please send me an email or say hi on my link…” Gosh, you make it sound so extraordinarily simple ! :-) Okay, by all means, “Hi, indeed !” Regarding the daddy war bucks Dear John letter, the phrase “If all the barriers were removed..” jumped off of the page at me. This, because I have seen this magic done before. There is an entire pseudo-science that manages this miracle by assigning what might otherwise be deemed as “constraints” to something almost benign and inconsequential. What were once “constraints” are now “externalities” and presto, a frontier without barriers ! Some others, however, maintain that such magic is something else enitrely–something like chicanery. A wise man once remarked quite sternly, “Capital cannot abide a limit”. And there are a number of us who believe him. That said, I would suggest also that it might be wise to approach the challenge using a philosophy that is quite different, in general nature, than that implicit in the language of the letter. That is to say, how about solving a cluster of smaller problems where there is, hopefully, more successes than failures ? In other words, you could, with your insight and keen observation become a sort of technical clearinghouse for the ideas of others. Indeed, your post here is sort of just that. But how about making it, officially, the vehicle you use to solve the problem(s) ? I get the idea, generally, from “The Cathedral and the Bazaar”, by Eric S. Raymond. Have you read it, by chance ? What do you think ?]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;All of Yudkowsky’s arguments about the dangers and benefits of AI are just appeals to intuition of various kinds, as indeed are the counter-arguments. So I wouldn’t hold your breath waiting for that to be settled. If he wants to live his own life based on his own hunches, that’s fine, but I see no reason for anyone else to take his land-grabs on terms like “rationality” and “altruism” at all seriously, merely because it’s not currently possible to provide mathematically rigorous proofs that his assignments of probabilities to various scenarios are incorrect. There’s an almost limitless supply of people who believe that their ideas are of Earth-shattering importance, and that it’s incumbent on the rest of the world to either follow them or spend their life proving them wrong.
