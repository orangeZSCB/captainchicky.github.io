I never got around to it.  But it&#039;s easy to create a number of variants of the rate equation and master equation, depending on whether one is interested in:

&#8226; ordered k-tuples of not-necessarily-distinct inputs
&#8226; unordered k-tuples of not-necessarily-distinct inputs
&#8226; ordered k-tuples of distinct inputs
&#8226; unordered k-tuples of distinct inputs

In my notes I&#039;m always considering ordered k-tuples of distinct inputs.  These are counted by the falling powers $latex n^{\underline{k}}.$   This case turns out to be most easily described using annihilation and creation operators.  However, to count unordered k-tuples of distinct inputs, you just divide by $latex k!$.  So, you can just divide each term in the Hamiltonian by a suitable factor.]]></description>

We shouldn&#039;t redefine $latex a^\dagger,$ it&#039;s too beautiful to change.  If we have a situation where a transition occurs at a rate proportional to $latex f(k)$ because we need to make some choice among the $latex k$ inputs, we can multiply the Hamiltonian by $latex f(k)$ to account for that.  I don&#039;t think duels between rabbits occur twice as fast because there are 2 choices of which rabbit might survive.]]></description>

Also, if operating with a on $latex z^n$ includes $latex n$, the number of ways a rabbit can be chosen from n rabbits, then shouldn’t operating with $latex a^{\dagger}$ also include the number of ways an output rabbit can be chosen from the $latex k$ inputs (at least in some cases)?]]></description>

Why are we considering all the $latex a^{\dagger}$s to appear on the left side of all the $latex a$s in $latex H = ({a^{\dagger}}^j a^k - N^{\underline{k}})$?

Because each transition in a stochastic Petri net describes a processes where a bunch of things get used simultaneously to create some other bunch of things.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Surely, there can be situations when the order is not- all inputs, then all outputs. Suppose that 2 rabbits meet and fight and one gets killed. The overconfident victor then challenges any one of the remaining rabbits to a duel and one of them then gets killed. The new victor seeing that he might get killed if he further challenges, stops.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That&#039;s true.  I would think of this using a Petri net with a set $latex S$ consisting of several states.  For example: ordinary rabbits, and &#039;overconfident victor rabbits&#039;, and &#039;wisely cautious victor rabbits&#039;.     I&#039;d also introduce several transitions in $latex T$, for example:

ordinary rabbit + ordinary rabbit $latex \to $ overconfident victor rabbit

overconfident victor rabbit + ordinary rabbit $latex \to$ wisely cautious rabbit

You can try to work out the Hamiltonian for such a process.  

Or, you can check to see if the Hamiltonian you propose is an infinitesimal stochastic operator.  If it is, it describes some random process.  If not, there&#039;s something wrong with it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/04/16/network-theory-part-6/#comment-5398&quot;&gt;David Corfield&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks.  I decided to switch to an argument that seems a bit simpler:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

In Puzzle 1, the Hamiltonian for catching rabbits is 

$latex H = a^\dagger - 1$

so the rate of change of the expected number of rabbits caught is

$latex \begin{array}{ccl} \frac{d}{dt} \sum N \Psi(t) &#038;=&#038; \sum N H \Psi(t) \\ 
&#038;=&#038; \sum N(a^\dagger - 1) \Psi(t) \end{array} $

There are many ways to use our rules to evaluate this.  For example, Rule 1 implies that

$latex \sum N(a^\dagger - 1) \Psi(t) = \sum a(a^\dagger - 1)\Psi(t) $$

but the commutation relations say 

$latex a a^\dagger = a^\dagger a + 1 = N+1$

so

$latex  \sum a(a^\dagger - 1)\Psi(t) = \sum (N + 1 - a) \Psi(t) $

and using Rule 1 again we see this equals

$latex \sum \Psi(t) = 1 $

Thus we have

$latex \frac{d}{dt} \sum N \Psi(t) = 1 $

It follows that the expected number of rabbits grows linearly:

$latex \sum N \Psi(t) = t + c $&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>
