I think so. There is no reason not to mix in char in soil, and done properly it supposedly can sequester more carbon by humification.]]></description>

I think the total production is about 1 gigatonne, but China&#039;s numbers are all over the place.

If we used CO2 recycled products everywhere even for durable items - furniture, construction materials (people who live in plastic houses), etc. - I would assume multiple gigatonnes could be used. But still not enough by itself.]]></description>

Eric, I&#039;m glad to meet someone who recognizes that, and might understand why I&#039;ve been jumping around pointing to those inflection points in all kinds of things.  They are indeed when profit principles reverse sign for a great many investment strategies.  There&#039;s the inflection point in oil reserve discoveries in the 1950&#039;s, for example...   It should be profitable to help people see them and understand what to do, certainly, and I&#039;d like to help.  From a scientific approach it comes with expanding the language of science to include what business people see in the world... and that&#039;s kind of tough.   It feels like persuading both that we live in a natural world not their imagined theoretical one, and having to drag them kicking and screaming!! ;-)]]></description>

Hi Phil,

I agree with you 100%. That is why I talk about it to rooms full of financial professionals. My current occupation is risk manager for a large financial services firm.

You do not need oil to run out in order to have macroeconomic consequence. The second derivative going to zro will be bad enough.]]></description>

That&#039;s what I think as well, a mix of distributions. The approach that I notice that everyone takes is to take a distribution of varying time constants. What we actually want is a distribution of varying &lt;i&gt;rate&lt;/i&gt; constants. The maximum entropy principle always applies to rates because that is nearer to an energy concept than time, and we apply the mean to an energy. If you do this and assume a diffusion limited rate, you get a curve that goes as 1/(1 + c*sqrt(time)). If you compare this curve to the one in the Joos and Bruno reference and to the IPCC model, you can see the similarity. I advocate this approach because it matches the physicists preferred method of getting to a simple result in as few steps as possible. The rationale is that others interested in the work could then make it more elaborate by building on this foundation.]]></description>

Eric &#038; Dave, with still growing demand in many places, though,...  gradual supply reduction creates market shocks that are severe.  Continued increasing demand from some will need to be supplied by raising the price to levels that are prohibitive for others, is the hitch.  That&#039;s the characteristic of &quot;systemic demand exceeding supply&quot;.

It&#039;s the real world look of &quot;the big crunch&quot;, I&#039;m afraid, that so many people have been predicting for so long, but didn&#039;t understand what it would look like when it came.]]></description>

David, Yes indeed, a majority of the well paid &quot;problem solvers&quot; are only solving them hypothetically!!  ...and not paying attention as the earth is making every single step more and more costly and complex, the way nature signals the limits of things...

What we have is a shortage of &quot;problem finders&quot; for discovering what problems are not worth trying to solve, and a waste of time and money taken from others that are!

					<description><![CDATA[This might also be a time to request a post or two on how mathematical convolution relates to the observed CO2 response.
I googled Azimuth and only found a reference from that interview with Nathan Urban, week #304
&lt;blockquote&gt;The impulse response model makes its prediction by summing up lots of copies of the impulse repsonse curve, with different sizes and at different times. (Techincally, this is a convolution of the impulse response curve, or Green’s function, with the emissions trajectory curve.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Upthread, I made the observation of the CO2 impulse response showing a significant fat-tail (what kind of Green&#039;s function is that?). With convolution you can readily map out how the CO2 emission forcing function interacts with the impulse response, thus giving that &lt;i&gt;loooong&lt;/i&gt; lag between shutting down CO2 emissions and seeing a significant change in atmospheric CO2. 

So the suggestion is to educate how this comes about from a mathematical physicists&#039;s perspective, and perhaps spur someone to think about the problem in a new way.]]></description>

John, I think it&#039;s that you consider the economy to be a collection of trends, like data, rather than a collection of mechanisms that operate on their own.  That or something like it keeps you from identify the right mechanism driving growth, and making it necessary for financial stability.  It&#039;s not just a social belief that drives it, but built into the rules of finance, and the defined purposes of regulation. They are arranged to direct the management of the physical world to allow the financial world to produce continually multiplying real returns for money saved in the past.

When you start studying the active mechanisms you start finding what really must change in our rules, to then guide you to discovering what really can (because the necessary change is a real problem).  That would be real system steering.  Just using social policy to favor desirable trends, while part of it of course, will have quite the opposite of the intended effect by itself, is the catch.]]></description>
