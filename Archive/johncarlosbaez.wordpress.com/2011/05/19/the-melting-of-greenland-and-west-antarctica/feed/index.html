Well, you can fit a parabola to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sealevel.colorado.edu/files/current/sl_ib_ns_global.txt&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;UC sea level data&lt;/a&gt; and see the acceleration is -0.103 mm/yr&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. It means right now (May 2011) rate of sea level rise is 2.18 mm/yr.

On the other hand if Rignot is right, current polar ice sheet mass loss is about 675 Gt/year. That alone corresponds to a 1.88 mm/yr eustatic sea level rise.

As &lt;a href=&quot;http://sealevel.colorado.edu/content/what-glacial-isostatic-adjustment-gia-and-why-do-you-correct-it&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;GIA correction&lt;/a&gt; is +0.3 mm/yr, that leaves nothing to thermosteric rise. But even 0.33 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; input should have caused at least 0.5 mm/yr. And then no glacier melt outside polar ice sheets is taken into account. Error bars, perhaps. Are they large enough?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/05/19/the-melting-of-greenland-and-west-antarctica/#comment-5927&quot;&gt;Berényi Péter&lt;/a&gt;.

I don&#039;t know the answer to your question, since I&#039;m not an expert on this stuff.  But here&#039;s what comes to mind.

I doubt water stored in dams plays a significant role: I think the ocean is too big for that to matter much.

Here&#039;s something that sounds relevant, from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2006/08/ocean-heat-content-latest-numbers/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Gavin over at RealClimate&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

Recently, a new preprint with the latest observations (2003 to 2005) has appeared (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/people/lyman/Pdf/heat_2006.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Lyman &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, hat tip to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/people/lyman/Pdf/heat_2006.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Climate Science&lt;/a&gt;) which shows a decrease in the ocean heat content over those two years, decreasing the magnitude of the long-term trend that had been shown from 1993 to 2003 in previous work (Willis et al, 2004) – from 0.6 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to about 0.33 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This has generated a lot of commentary in some circles, but in many cases the full context has not been appreciated.

[...]

One problem is that if the ocean has lost heat at the suggested rate, then the thermal expansion part of recent sea level rise should have decreased (i.e. sea level should have dropped). Overall, sea level however has continued to rise unabated according to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sealevel.colorado.edu/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;altimeter satellites&lt;/a&gt;. The only way to reconcile the results would be to have had a sharp compensating increase in freshwater from the ice sheets adding to sea level (from 0.7 mm/yr to 2.9 mm/yr). This is conceivable (though unlikely), but clearly would not be good news!

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So, he seems to be disagreeing with your claim that sea level rise is slowing, but also saying that if Lyman &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt; are right that the ocean is warming up more slowly now, then ice sheets need to be melting faster to explain the &quot;unabated&quot; sea level rise.

However, I find this passage fairly confusing, since:

1) A decrease from 0.6 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to about 0.33 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. sounds like a decrease in how fast the ocean is warming up, not a &quot;decrease in ocean heat content&quot;.  

2) Saying that &quot;thermal expansion part of recent sea level rise should have decreased&quot; sounds different than saying &quot;sea level should have dropped&quot;.

In both cases there seems to be a confusion between a quantity and its first time derivative, so maybe Gavin was not explaining things clearly, or maybe I&#039;m just confused.  I suspect that another 10 minutes of reading the links could clear this up, but I&#039;m very tired right now.

If you click on the reference to &lt;a href=&quot;http://sealevel.colorado.edu/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;altimeter satellites&lt;/a&gt; you&#039;ll see this graph of sea level rise, which seems to contradict what you are saying:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://sealevel.colorado.edu/content/global-mean-sea-level-time-series-seasonal-signals-removed&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://sealevel.colorado.edu/files/current/sl_ib_ns_global.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

So, maybe you should try to reconcile this data with what you&#039;re saying.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If acceleration term of polar ice loss is about -36.3 Gt/year&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; during the last 18 years, then acceleration of sea level rise due to ice melt should be 0.1 mm/year&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for the same period.

However, using &lt;a href=&quot;http://sealevel.colorado.edu/files/current/sl_ib_ns_global.txt&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Global Mean Sea Level Time Series&lt;/a&gt; data from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sealevel.colorado.edu/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;CU Sea Level Research Group&lt;/a&gt; it is easy to see there was a &lt;i&gt;deceleration&lt;/i&gt; in sea level rise, its magnitude is about the same but its sign is just the opposite: -0.1 mm/year&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

Therefore there is a deceleration of -0.2 mm/year&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in sea level rise due to factors other than polar ice melt. Do you know how much of it is due to decreasing rate of heat sequestration in the oceans (as opposed to other factors like increasing water storage in dams)?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/05/19/the-melting-of-greenland-and-west-antarctica/#comment-5903&quot;&gt;ar18&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;q&gt;The melting of the ice caps, like the climate, is chaotic, not linear and unchanging.&lt;/q&gt;

No one said it&#039;s linear.  (That doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s chaotic, though, at least not on the time scales being discussed here.)

&lt;q&gt;Twenty years of data is not representative of the last 1000 years of past history or future trends.&lt;/q&gt;

And no one said it&#039;s &quot;representative of the last 1000 years&quot;.  The concern is actually that it may &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be representative of the last 1000 years.  As for future trends, whether the recent rate will be sustained or not has a lot to do with what&#039;s causing it, which is the subject of current research.

It&#039;s incorrect to claim that one can simply extrapolate a 20 year trend into the future with confidence.  But it is also incorrect to claim that a 20 year trend is uninformative about how ice dynamics respond to temperature over century time scales.


There is a difference here between simple statistical extrapolation (regression) and mechanistic insight. What such trends may tell us about the future ice response to warming is going to depend on observing more than just the melting, but other covariates (such as temperatures), in combination with physical modeling, rather on arguing whether a set of raw data has a trend in it.

&lt;q&gt;What we are seeing now is the noise, not the trend.&lt;/q&gt;

That&#039;s an assertion, not a conclusion resulting from scientific inquiry.

&lt;q&gt;For all we know, the Little Ice Age never ended, and we are just experiencing a short reprieve.&lt;/q&gt;

Again, what we know about the climate does not depend on some simple statistical extrapolation of past temperatures.  If all we had was a temperature time series, no, we wouldn&#039;t be able to tell whether the present warming is due to a continuation of the LIA recovery, or whether it is due to the enhanced greenhouse effect.  But a temperature time series is far from the only piece of information we have.  The reason why we say that the current climate is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; merely a continuation of the LIA is due to our observations of natural climate forcings, and modes of variability (such as atmosphere-ocean heat transfer), in comparison to the pattern of anthropogenic forcings.

&lt;q&gt;We have not exited that Ice Age yet, just because we are experiencing an interglaciation. To blindly assume otherwise that would be jumping to conclusions…again.&lt;/q&gt;

It&#039;s not an &quot;assumption&quot;.  Whether we enter another glacial period, and when, is a result of physical understanding of the climate system, both theoretical and observational.

In the absence of the anthropogenic greenhouse effect, we would likely enter another glacial period within tens of thousands of years.  This is not really relevant to what people are talking about here, both because we&#039;re talking about shorter time scales, and because the anthropogenic greenhouse effect is not absent.]]></description>

Alpha Omega: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;

...the quasi-religious belief that every problem can be solved by human ingenuity is a modern idea that didn’t exist in the pre-Enlightenment world, and is probably pathological.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I&#039;ve read statements like &quot;when we run out of oil, the free market will make it profitable for people to look for alternatives, they will invent those, problem solved&quot;. I&#039;m very worried that maybe important people think that research is as simple as that, and that the free markets will solve all problems this way. Research just does not work this way, you cannot speed up people&#039;s thinking by paying more money.

If you are talking about this kind of attitude, I agree with you.

On the other hand, in my professional life, I have a lot of interactions with people in the middle management of big companies. &quot;Be optimistic&quot; is a necessity in order to survive in these jobs, and in order to get anything done and be effective. The ability to identify the most important problems, the believe that these problems can be solved, and the ability to encourage others to team up and help with solving these problems, are the key to the success of any company. 

It is a delicate balance, taking the problems seriously, while not to lose the optimism that they will be solved eventually.]]></description>

I&#039;d say I&#039;m in a modified stage 2:

2&#039;) big problems ahead, but humanity &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; solve them.

They are just too lazy, stupid, scared, greedy, want more babies, etc. etc., whatever.

Civilization as we know it is possibly doomed. But that&#039;s not the end of the world. Instead that prospect makes the world way more interesting and challenging. I&#039;m actually happy to be alive at this crucial moment in the evolutionary history of hominids and of Life in total.

It&#039;s just a slight nuisance for me that I had to decide to continue my postponed math studies &lt;i&gt;now&lt;/i&gt;, not when I&#039;m 66.

How do we live with the fact that we are destroying our world? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.joannamacy.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Joanna Macy&lt;/a&gt; has advice in her article &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yesmagazine.org/issues/climate-solutions/the-greatest-danger&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Greatest Danger&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When we open our eyes to what is happening, even when it breaks our hearts, we discover our true size; for our heart, when it breaks open, can hold the whole universe.&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

Yes, I&#039;ve seen them online.  For some reason  I thought you were talking about people on this blog, but I guess you weren&#039;t.]]></description>

I&#039;m talking about the hardcore, apocalyptic Malthusian doomer crowd who have given up all hope and are actively rooting for civilization to collapse.  Maybe you haven&#039;t come across these people, but they&#039;re out there, and strangely enough quite a few of them have advanced degrees in science.  Visit guymcpherson.com for example.  Guy is a former biology professor who believes industrial civilization is the root of all evil and must be destroyed.  He&#039;s predicting a new Dark Age by 2012 and a new Stone Age by 2025, and thinks this is great news!]]></description>
