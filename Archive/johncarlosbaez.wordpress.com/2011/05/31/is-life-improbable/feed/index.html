The problem is that Wigner&#039;s argument shows only that for any particular very precisely defined form of life, it&#039;s unlikely that randomly chosen laws of physics will let &lt;em&gt;this particular&lt;/em&gt; form of life reproduce.  The more interesting question is whether randomly chosen laws of physics will let &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; form of life reproduce.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;

Wasn’t Wigner the guy with the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics paper?

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yes: Wigner won the Nobel prize for his work applying group theory to nuclear physics and particle physics, but later he started wondering &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; such abstract math was so good at describing our universe.  You can see his famous essay here:

&#8226; Eugene Wigner &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The unreasonable effectiveness in the mathematical sciences&lt;/a&gt;, 1960.

It begins like this:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

There is a story about two friends, who were classmates in high school, talking about their jobs. One of them became a statistician and was working on population trends. He showed a reprint to his former classmate. The reprint started, as usual, with the Gaussian distribution and the statistician explained to his former classmate the meaning of the symbols for the actual population, for the average population, and so on. His classmate was a bit incredulous and was not quite sure whether the statistician was pulling his leg. &quot;How can you know that?&quot; was his query. &quot;And what is this symbol here?&quot; &quot;Oh,&quot; said the statistician, &quot;this is pi.&quot; &quot;What is that?&quot; &quot;The ratio of the circumference of the circle to its diameter.&quot; &quot;Well, now you are pushing your joke too far,&quot; said the classmate, &quot;surely the population has nothing to do with the circumference of the circle.&quot; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Of course they were talking about the normal distribution

$latex \displaystyle{ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}} e^{-x^2 / 2 \sigma^2 }} $

&lt;blockquote&gt;

(Of course, if there are an infinite number of random worlds, there may be an infinite number of them without effective mathematics since I suppose there are more worlds than descriptions, but I’d still like to see a Wigner universe.)

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Greg Egan has nicely argued that if we weight simple worlds more heavily than complicated ones, than the most heavily weighted worlds with life in them are going to have nice mathematical descriptions.  This idea of weighting worlds, i.e. hypotheses, according to their simplicity is the basis of &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week312.html#Solomonoff%20Induction&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Solomonoff induction&lt;/a&gt;, which Eliezer Yudkowsky mentioned in &quot;week313&quot; of &lt;i&gt;This Week&#039;s Finds&lt;/i&gt;.

However, nonmathematicians may find this bias towards simplicity gives math an unfair advantage.  &lt;img src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/emoticons/rolleyes.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wasn&#039;t Wigner the guy with the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics paper? That always struck me as odd because any real world that can do arithmetic can contain models or analogs of its own processes. Once these exist, situations in which they are effective will elucidate them. I find it much harder to imagine a world in which one cannot construct some kind of effective mathematics. How would one describe it? (Of course, if there are an infinite number of random worlds, there may be an infinite number of them without effective mathematics since I suppose there are more worlds than descriptions, but I&#039;d still like to see a Wigner universe.)

I&#039;m not really surprised he ran into a similar problem dealing with the probability of life. If you use a broad enough definition, any repeating process can be considered a life form, and each repetition a new generation. The probability of repeating, or at least approximately repeating processes, always strikes me as high, though we&#039;d have to put up with a lot of rather boring life forms.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/05/31/is-life-improbable/#comment-6118&quot;&gt;Uwe Stroinski&lt;/a&gt;.

My paper shows that it&#039;s pathetically easy to find self-reproducing states if you phrase the problem a certain way.  It&#039;s very hard if you phrase the problem another way.  The relevance to biology is indeed non-obvious: as someone pointed out in my talk today, organisms keep changing slightly, so we shouldn&#039;t expect to find a fixed subspace of &#039;living&#039; states $latex V \subseteq H_1$ that has

$latex S: V \otimes \langle w \rangle \to V \otimes V \otimes H_2 $

(where I&#039;m using notation as in my blog post above).  However, I think we need to study stupid over-idealized models to realize that they&#039;re stupid and over-idealized and find ways to make them a bit less stupid and over-idealized.]]></description>
