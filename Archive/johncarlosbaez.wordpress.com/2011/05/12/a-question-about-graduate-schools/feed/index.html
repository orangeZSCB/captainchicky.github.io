Thanks for the update, Blake!  Good luck!

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The UC’s are also on my list, Riverside and Irvine, even with Baez in Singapore...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I&#039;ll be back at Riverside by the time you get there, if there&#039;s where you happen to go: I&#039;ll return in September 2012. 

Of course, I won&#039;t be wanting to talk about loop quantum gravity, representation theory, Clifford algebras, spinors or twistors.   I&#039;m focused on this &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/networks.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&#039;network theory&#039;&lt;/a&gt; project, and I&#039;m looking for grad students who want to work on that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey all.

I know this post has been dead for a minute but I figured I&#039;d update you all with where I&#039;m at. I actually moved to Hawaii and am a private tutor living on the North Shore of Oahu.... chasing some waves! I&#039;ve embarked upon my grad school apps though and some of you will probably be hearing from me. I&#039;m definately submitting applications to Oxford and Cambridge, as Oxford has the many centres/groups discussed above and Cambridge has a Geometrical Algebra group of which Chris Doran used to be a part (he was visiting Columbia while I was an undergrad). I&#039;ll also be applying to UChicago as Staniczenko&#039;s group sounds like fun and their physics department is great. The UC&#039;s are also on my list, Riverside and Irvine, even with Baez in Singapore, my former roommate is doing is math PhD at Davis, which seems like a good spot, and of course Berkley, Santa Barbara, and Santa Cruz as I&#039;d still like to be able to surf for the next 5 years. Also Lauda (I sat in on category theory with him at Columbia and was fortunate enough to take rep theory with Khovanov) is now at USC, which could be good. Penn State also might have something to offer with Ashketar&#039;s group in loop quantum gravity. I&#039;m really looking now for a solid physics program where there is exciting inter-disciplinary work. This post ended up being more than helpful and I spent many a night getting lost clicking links from where this leads. 
I&#039;ve been keeping busy with Lounesto&#039;s book on Clifford Algebras and Spinors as well as Penrose&#039;s two volumes on spacetime, spinors and twistors. Thanks again all for the replies.

Just to clarify: I wasn&#039;t talking about publishing papers while still an undergrad; I was talking about doing it as a grad student before you start work on your thesis.  

You see, in the US there&#039;s enough time in grad school for mathematicians or theoretical physicists to do this.  They spend 2 years doing coursework, but if they&#039;re ambitious and smart, they can be writing papers at the same time.

Indeed, it&#039;s quite common for good students in these fields to have published a few papers before submitting their thesis.  I force all my students to do it: if they can&#039;t finish writing a paper in time for their oral exam, I won&#039;t take them on as PhD students.  But I help them do it.  I figure if they leave grad school not yet having experienced the whole process of submitting papers to journals, responding to referees&#039; criticisms, etcetera, they don&#039;t really know what their chosen profession is like.]]></description>

I think there&#039;s a lot of trade-offs (although I&#039;ve only second-hand knowledge of the US system). Because the US system is built around giving the freedom to choose whatever stuff fulfils requirements and it&#039;s not unusual for people to take different numbers of years, it&#039;s probably easier to make enough of a connections to get the stimulation to produce a paper whilst an undergrad. In the UK it (used to be) a relatively fixed-format 3 year course with few &quot;breathing spaces&quot; and is rare to be able to write a paper (except in the experimental sciences where you might get your name on a paper for &quot;primarily labwork&quot;). My impression is that even the really high-flyers on my (mathematics) degree course focussed even more on exams if they had spare time. My view of the difference is that the UK is more suitable than the US if you don&#039;t feel like sitting in courses outside your main interest &lt;em&gt;as part of what you&#039;re paying for at university&lt;/em&gt;. (Following Mark Twain I never let my schooling interfere with my education.)

One practical upshot of this difference is that embarking on a PhD after doing a related undergrad degree the basic knowledge known is a lot more uniform; I gather the taught part of US grad school is partly because even with a &quot;major&quot; in X two US undergrads could have studied vastly different areas of the subject. (I &quot;moved&quot; from mathematics undergrad to computer science PhD via an intermediate MSc.)

But the point I really wanted to make was that, in considering a graduate degree in a more &quot;experimental&quot; subject -- such as environmental areas -- there may be &quot;support expenses&quot; like data collection field trips, machinery, lab workers, etc, which are paid for from a specific grant. Thus starting an associated PhD there&#039;s a lot less freedom than a more &quot;pencil and paper&quot; subject area. (It sounds like Blake&#039;s primary interest is in mathematical physics so this doesn&#039;t apply, but I thought it worth mentioning in the general discussion.)]]></description>

Good luck!  It would be very nice if you keep us posted here about what you find out and what you decide to do.

I&#039;m busy trying to extend techniques developed in quantum network theory (which I&#039;ve been working on for years) to more practical applications, and I have a feeling that this will be a growing area in the next 5-10 years.  If you don&#039;t know this book already, I recommend it as a place to get started:

&#8226; Bob Coecke, editor, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.springer.com/physics/theoretical,+mathematical+%26+computational+physics/book/978-3-642-12820-2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;New Structures for Physics&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Springer, Berlin, 2011.

It&#039;s an intimidatingly fat book, but the articles are all expository, they can be read independently, and many of them are available for free &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.0340&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/08/new_structures_for_physics_i.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/09/new_structures_for_physics_ii.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>

I&#039;ve heard it said that to get the best of both worlds, you should do your undergraduate work in the UK and your graduate work in the US.  The first prepares you to instantly dive into research when you become a grad student, and then the second gives you lots of time to take courses and make sure you know what you&#039;re interested in before doing a thesis.  (It&#039;s always good to write and publish papers &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; doing a thesis, so being ready to hit the ground running is not wasted.)]]></description>

I&#039;m sure I&#039;m saying something well known, but because UK first degrees are generally much more focussed than American first degrees, that tends to mean that the things that the taught part of a US graduate program address tend not to be dealt with informally as an add-on to research.

This probably doesn&#039;t apply to mathematical physics but in the UK in more applied areas it&#039;s relatively common to get a PhD place working on a specific project grant, which means that while you have some freedom in the precise problem you work on (particularly if it becomes clear an issue unanticipated in the grant proposal is going to block all the plans), the &quot;mid-level problem area&quot; in which you&#039;re working is decided from the time you start. (This was certainly the case in my PhD in computer science.) Whether you feel you can commit to this when you&#039;re still investigating what interests you is a key issue in considering doing a PhD in the UK.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[First, let me thank you all for the replies!

I&#039;ve been poking around the CAOS at the Courant Institute website, as well as the slew of Oxford institutes and there is surely some interesting research/projects going on at both that I wasn&#039;t aware of. 

I also was interested by some of the work being done with respect to application of network theory to environment-related problems. I think I have to do some more reading before I can tell you what quantum network theory is, but reading some of the old papers and looking through some of the current work being done it seems to be a good fit as a subject where PhD studies in mathematical physics could be completed with an eye towards more practical applications, environmental or of a wider variety. 

Thanks again! I&#039;ll try to keep you posted about what I find and don&#039;t find.]]></description>

Oh, interesting.  Since Blake is at Columbia it should be easy for him to check out these options.]]></description>
