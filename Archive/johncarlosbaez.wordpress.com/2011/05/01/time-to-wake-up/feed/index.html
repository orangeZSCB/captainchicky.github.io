					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/05/01/time-to-wake-up/#comment-5791&quot;&gt;Robert Smart&lt;/a&gt;.

Robert &#038; Flori, How come, like Al Gore it seems too, when looking for the core problem we end up throwing up our hands (as I see it) and blaming spirits for everything?  Isn&#039;t that part of what is so impractical about human reasoning?  I think giving in to that tendency to fall back on having faith in or laying blame on cosmic abstractions of our cultural beliefs is part of the problem.  It&#039;s a practical problem that is stumping us us, isn&#039;t it?

I&#039;ve found so many good examples of how we fail to recognize what information we need to collect, for not asking the &quot;dumb questions&quot;.  It makes that a rather good candidate for  the deep flaw in our way of making models of nature.   Take the example of my quite firm finding that businesses are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.synapse9.com/pub/SEA&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;only aware of nominally ~20% of the real energy impacts of business choices&lt;/a&gt;.  It&#039;s remarkably simple.  They have not been counting the energy demand that results from  paying for their operating services, but only examining supply chain fuel purchases.

So the way business measures environmental impacts and development impacts differ by the same fivefold amount, is one of the curiosities.  When businesses come into a community and expand the housing and commerce and infrastructure, etc. that&#039;s all counted as a positive economic impact benefit of the development. Not single bit of that resulting energy use, accelerated resource depletion or CO2 or other environmental impacts are counted! The two impact measures don&#039;t compare because of the &quot;magic&quot; of differently defining the categories, and no one asking the &quot;dumb questions&quot;.  

There are several ways to consider the &quot;moral&quot;, &quot;cognitive&quot; or &quot;spiritual&quot; failing that represents, but its still also a matter of not collecting the appropriate information, too.  It&#039;s still saying one thing and collecting information about another thing.  

We don&#039;t seem to see the connection between money and the environment apparently because we overlook how we use money to make requests for environmental services.  So we seem to have a whole society effectively ignoring all the impacts that we ask others to do for us.  It&#039;s nutty, but evidence this whole thing is new to us in some quite unexpected way too.

Looking into how we make such broad conceptual errors doesn&#039;t automatically resolve how we manage to do it, of course.   Still it is a fairly sure way to bring up and study the problem isn&#039;t it?]]></description>

I wasn&#039;t having emotional tension in mind - although the Buddha&#039;s concept of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukkha&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;dukkha&lt;/a&gt; embraces that. To get rid of dukkha, the Buddha recommends developing a clear mind. 5 points of his &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_Eightfold_Path&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Noble Eightfold Path&lt;/a&gt; are just about this.

Al Gore, Earth in the Balance, 1993:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The more deeply I search for the roots of the global environmental crisis, the more I am convinced that it is an outer manifestation of an inner crisis that is, for lack of a better word, spiritual.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

So, there are indeed emotional forces behind our civilization&#039;s clinging to the trusted beliefs of c20th wonderland. &lt;i&gt;Most people can not seperate clear thinking from emotion.&lt;/i&gt; Another aspect is that it takes considerable stomach to look down the abyss - and Buddhism can help strengthen the mind. (Joanna Macy is a great contemporary example. Another, weird, example is the kamikaze pilots trained at Japanese Zen monasteries...)

I wish I could point to convincing evidence that Buddhism can help us out of the trap.  After all, a basic Buddhist concept is the doctrine of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prat%C4%ABtyasamutp%C4%81da&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;codependent co-arising&lt;/a&gt;, which renders it a truely ecologic philosophy. So, Buddhists are keenly aware of our ecologic &quot;sins&quot;. Here&#039;s some meager evidence: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ecobuddhism.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;A Buddhist Response to
The Climate Emergency&lt;/a&gt;. Alas it&#039;s c20th ecologic thinking and some aspirational prayers. They do not yet get the consequences for their following the Noble Eightfold Path: Not carbon negative, no Bodhisattva. Not carbon negative, no sangha...

(&#039;nuff said on that...)]]></description>

Flori, That&#039;s wonderful for relieving emotional tension, but we have a physical world problem.  We have a whole global society pursuing a physical course of action sure to result in its permanent rapid decline.   

All signs are that we&#039;re not actually suicidal, but actually confused by our misinformation, and caught in &quot;the standard boom-bust trap&quot; we have repeatedly taken to it&#039;s natural demise over and over in history.  We can&#039;t get out of it without realizing that some belief(s) we trust implicitly were only valid in the circumstances of the past and no longer apply.  

The real problem, though, seems to be neither emotional nor practical.  It seems to be simply that people see no reason to question cultural values they hold without question.  

So, if you say the Buddha&#039;s method solves that, can you demonstrate it by pointing to how we are trapped by our trusted beliefs, and would need to question them in order to escape from using up everything on earth ever faster even as we collide with the limits of resource exhaustion?

That&#039;s one of the things we are demonstrably doing as a collective behavior, that is completely inconsistent with what we would ever do in our individual behavior.]]></description>

Not clinging to things and self opens space for insight and action (or nonaction). As does B&#039;s &quot;law of the non-excluded middle&quot; which relativizes true and false (belief), etc.

Funny, indeed methinks B was a mind Copernicus. Alas he lays buried under a huge pile of superfluous (incl. supernatural) stuff.]]></description>

Flori, the Buddha may have solved it for the way he posed the question, but does that solve our present problem.  How would people today begin to perceive in foresight what kinds of wealth are becoming dangerous delusions?   Wouldn&#039;t you need some kind of model of how &quot;true belief&quot; becomes &quot;false belief&quot; without you doing anything, just by itself, that people could understand?]]></description>

Robert, How our thoughts are controlled by our genes is so hypothetical I don&#039;t really see a way to pose answerable questions about it.  Scenarios are on thing but for the boom and bust phenomenon I look elsewhere for answerable questions.  Isn&#039;t that the strength of science, spending the time to patiently look for answerable questions, that build on answerable questions?   

The boom and bust phenomenon appears to come with a great many examples to point to, that have a lot of similarities.  I see them as great eruptions of wealth that end in collapsing the economic environment in which they thrived, for reasons that look foolish in hind sight.  Isn&#039;t that evidence of confusion?

Perhaps we could figure out what confused belief system gives rise to them, and persistently keeps fooling people over and over.   Discovering that might be something as important as the discoveries that Copernicus and Galileo made that revolutionized the Ptolemaic model?]]></description>

I didn&#039;t mean to suggest that human motivations are independent of our genes&#039; motivations. Far from it. Once I thought of writing a self-help book titled &quot;The key to happiness: respect your genes, but stand up to them&quot;. Our genes push us to change with sadness and pain, and they push us to continue with happiness and pleasure.  You can&#039;t be happy unless you &quot;convince&quot; your genes that what you are doing will work for them. Things that genes like include: making children and increasing your status. Increasing your status is particularly good (in the primitive environment in which we evolved) since it improves the survival of ourselves and our family. However people with high status sometimes seem to not realise that we can&#039;t all take that route.

Genes have motivation with zero intelligence. Computers in 20 years will have intelligence with zero motivation. Motivation is orthogonal to intelligence. The way genes arise means that they have an apparent world-view that &quot;the future will be like the past&quot;. Overcoming this by the application of human intelligence is nontrivial.]]></description>

Robert, But in this case it may be actual *human* motivation that takes precedence in economic behavior, rather than implied genetic motivation, right?  ;-)   The basic question about boom and bust, from hindsight, is &quot;What WERE they thinking?!?!&quot;.  

So, what do you think people are thinking as they drive their runs of great success to failure.  In the &quot;go go&quot; phase, long before the &quot;oh no&quot; phase, what is it that people are saying &quot;go&quot; about?  

My approach is to poke around looking for answerable questions that might be &quot;hidden in sight&quot; or just surprising.  When people are somehow tricking themselves it implies we are somehow dodging the answers we&#039;re looking for, that might be found looking behind the stage props for the argument we weren&#039;t aware of being there.]]></description>

Important to understand that evolution isn&#039;t survival of the fittest species, or the fittest individuals within a species, but of the fittest genes within a species. Genes have their own motivation, which creates but is distinct from the motivation of individuals. Genes are also highly amoral even though they create morality. Its a very interesting area. There are many popular books on the subject which all need to be read with care. I like Frans de Waal best, but don&#039;t always agree with him.]]></description>
