Nice!  These models where particles can randomly move around, split or die are actually examples of &#039;stochastic Petri nets&#039; or &#039;chemical reaction networks&#039;, at least if we only allow the particles to occupy finitely many locations.  The same is true for certain evolutionary games.  So the story about &#039;Bayesian updating is like natural selection&#039; can be seen as saying that two different ways of applying stochastic Petri nets are two sides of the same coin!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Marc Harper sent me an email today saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I just uploaded a paper to the ArXiv that may shed some light on the entropy / evolution situation. In the paper, I calculate the entropy rates of many finite population dynamics (Markov processes), including the Moran process and the Wright-Fisher process. The Moran process yields the replicator equation in the large population limit (as the deterministic part Langevin equation of a diffusion-drift stochastic differential equation).

The term entropy &lt;b&gt;rate&lt;/b&gt; is a bit of a misnomer -- the entropy rate is a natural generalization of Shannon entropy to Markov processes, but not a rate in the dx/dt sense. It does not explicitly involve the population distribution (like the relative entropy in EGT); rather it is in some sense a measure of how much the population distribution varies in the long run of the Markov process. There are several notable results, including:

1) the entropy rate is typically maximized for neutral fitness landscapes, with all other parameters constant
2) the entropy rate goes to zero as the mutation rate goes to zero
3) the entropy rate is bounded below the theoretical maximum for generic Markov processes

(1) and (2) match intuition well (mine at least). The paper is here: http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.1890

The main idea is that &quot;Logic is reducible to evolutionary theory&quot;. He speaks more about commonly accepted systems of logic (deductive, inductive, decision theory and mathematics) as branches of biology, but his theory could apply to nonclassical logic systems.

He sais that logic isn&#039;t absolute but enforced by specific evolutionary processes, that the foundation of logical theories are biological, with no metaphysical status of their own.  He starts analyzing behavioral logic of primitive organisms, showing that the algorithm that generates a specific behaviour remembers the results of past evolutionary processes (naming them life-history strategies). Finally, with a system that could simulate different branches of possible behaviours, the reason of complex organisms, including humans, is in fact a bunch of analysis proposition about evolutionary processes.]]></description>

I&#039;m glad you like this blog!

Unfortunately I can&#039;t comment on &lt;i&gt;The Evolution of Reason: Logic as a Branch of Biology&lt;/i&gt; because I haven&#039;t read it.  What is his idea/theory? 

Still, I can say some stuff:

Clearly some aspects of &#039;reason&#039; or &#039;logic&#039; seem to be present in the behavior of animals, and I&#039;d love to know more about how that evolved into human reasoning... which of course makes heavy use of &lt;i&gt;language&lt;/i&gt; and ultimately &lt;i&gt;writing&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;computation&lt;/i&gt; at its most sophisticated levels.  

As for &#039;classical logic&#039;, it&#039;s probably worth noting that what most people call classical logic is only one of several systems of logic that work quite well.  In particular, the idea of binary truth tables and the logical operations &#039;and&#039;, &#039;or&#039;, &#039;not&#039; and &#039;implies&#039; defined as we customarily do it now came quite late in the history of mathematics; you can&#039;t find them in Aristotelian logic unless you&#039;re willing to take things he said and twist them around quite a bit.  I doubt you&#039;ll find them in Buddhist logic either... and the Chinese tradition seems to have been even less concerned with issues of this sort.  

So, I don&#039;t think we should take a modern Western mathematician&#039;s idea of &#039;classical logic&#039; and claim it&#039;s some sort of cultural universal that biological evolution was leading up to all along.  Ordinary folks use a much rougher form of reasoning, which seems to do well enough to let them have enough kids to pass their genes on most of the time.  

Does Cooper talk in detail about how ordinary people actually reason?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi John, wonderful blog.

 Would you be so kind and make a comment on Cooper’s work, &lt;i&gt;The Evolution of Reason: Logic as a Branch of Biology?&lt;/i&gt; How plausible is his idea/theory, in the light of the logic equivalence of natural selection and human reason (expressed by Bayesianism)? Is classical logic a biological feature?

Thanks]]></description>

But isn&#039;t every language essentially &quot;encrypted&quot; by default?   A language is something that only the community that creates it can use, right?   That means every species is essentially as barred from knowing what others are signaling to each other as people or academic disciplines using different languages are, like almost entirely.   

To me that has always implied that species are largely fending for themselves, and  seeing the world in their own terms.   For that problem success would rely on using active learning, in terms of their own language, as the way to discover food and shelter where it&#039;s both plentiful and safe gather.   

When you have an active learning task in mind when watching how both the simplest to most complex animals behave it seems that&#039;s exactly what all that &quot;foraging and dodging&quot; animals do is about.    Everyone is constantly &quot;sniffing around&quot; with whatever sense organ works for them,  taking care of themselves by a least cost strategy.    Aren&#039;t the animals who come into conflict with those of other species evidently not being successful at staying out of conflict, like the majority of their population are?]]></description>
