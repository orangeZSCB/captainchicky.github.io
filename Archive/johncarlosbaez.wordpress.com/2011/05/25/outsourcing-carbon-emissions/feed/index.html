					<description><![CDATA[The data on how some countries buy energy services from other countries is rather powerful, but mostly not traceable to the individual businesses that do it.   This is a global economy.    

That&#039;s part of the reason that an accounting method like my Systems Energy Assessment (SEA) is needed.   For energy accounting it’s a quite effective method for correcting for outdourcing.

The strong evidence of different countries do large amounts of outsourcing is that for the world economy, GDP and energy use have long been very simply and directly correlated, but for national accounts they are not.    World GDP for several decades has been growing steadily, with energy use growing at 60% of that rate, the difference being due to a similarly steady rate of improving efficiency in turning energy into wealth. 

US GDP continued to grow as fast or faster than the world&#039;s, but our energy use started to fall off in ~1960.   I know this contradicts all popular belief, but that&#039;s why you might not trust anything you hear on the news about how the world works...   The strong implication is that the US has been ever increasingly outsourcing its energy use.

see figures 1, 2 &#038; 5 at 
http://www.synapse9.com/pub/EffMultiplies.htm
and http://www.synapse9.com/SEA 
for the hard science that proves the premise with slides if you want to poke into environmental systems science a bit 

The real question is where does the diverging tendency of the US economy’s increasing dependency on other countries do the productive work we consume come to an end, as all divergences necessarily do.     That&#039;s another discussion, but the evidence that other countries, like India and China, are now weaning themselves off from working for us more and more, to working for themselves for a change, seems to be getting stronger I think.   It may have big consequences.]]></description>

(Quick comment before I vanish.)

There&#039;s often two things, the people of a country and the &quot;national governing and corporate machinery&quot; (which is often run by a relatively small number of people) which are often only very loosely connected. It&#039;s quite common to have problems with the  &quot;national governing and corporate machinery&quot; and its actions without having problems with most of the people. I have concerns about China and about the USA government/corporations, but then I also have problems with the British government/corporations (I&#039;m British), but I don&#039;t have problems with the majority of the populations.

Perhaps the saddest thing is that real policy issues seem to transform into mischaracterisations of the population of a country so easily.]]></description>

Good luck!  I think I can tell that your writing skills have improved.   You&#039;re way ahead of me.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://complitforlang.ucr.edu/people/faculty/bio.html?page=raphals.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;My wife&lt;/a&gt; speaks Chinese, since her specialty is comparing classical Chinese and Greek culture, but all I can say in Chinese is &quot;two bottles of beer&quot; and &quot;thank you&quot;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
And your blog had been blocked for a while in China. So far, it is still not stable to connect to your blog. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That&#039;s too bad!   Thanks for telling me.  I would hope the information on this blog is useful in China, just as anywhere else.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
But recently I feel very sad. I suddenly come to an idea that many people in other countries don’t like Chinese. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I urge you not to worry about this too much.  Many people around the world don&#039;t like Americans, but many people do.  It&#039;s the same with Chinese.  It&#039;s a stupid generalization to think that &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; Americans act some way, or &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; Chinese.  Often these generalizations come from lack of direct experience: having lived in both places, I know that both countries are full of wonderful kind people, and also full of mean nasty people.  Most people can be either kind &lt;i&gt;or&lt;/i&gt; nasty, depending on the situation.  I know I can.

Nationalistic generalizations can be dangerous, because they make it harder for people to live together in peace.  In particular, if China and America don&#039;t continue to find ways to live together peacefully, the whole world will suffer a lot.   The only thing people like you and me can do about this is to be friendly to people from other countries even when they criticize ours.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I’ve been asked by some people from other countries again and again what sort of animals I eat, cat, dog?  I just don’t know how to answer them because I have no idea of eating cats or dogs.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Well, I&#039;ve lived in Shanghai, and I&#039;ve been to a restaurant there that had dog meat on the menu.  I asked about it, and they told me that dog was not in season.   I was very surprised to hear that there was a season for dogs!  But it turns out some people think dog meat is &lt;i&gt;yang&lt;/i&gt;, so they eat it during the winter.

You can read more about this on that famous online encylopedia, in the article on &#039;dog meat&#039;.  If you do, you&#039;ll see lots of Chinese organizations have organized to protest the eating of dog meat.  

In France they have butchers that sell horse meat.  I took a photograph of one in the Latin Quarter of Paris:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/diary/july_2008.html#july18.08&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/diary/paris_2008/boucherie_chevaline.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Americans tend to find this shocking, because they don&#039;t eat horse meat.

Does any of this make me dislike Chinese people, or French people?  No&#8212;that would be silly.  I could easily list many things people do that are much worse than eating these particular animals.   And besides that, probably most Chinese or French don&#039;t actually eat these animals!  ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi John Baez.
Thank you for your comment. I indeed have been disappeared from this blog for a long time. I&#039;ve been working on my English(IELTS) test and application last year. And your blog had been blocked for a while in China. So far, it is still not stable to connect to your blog. I use illegal software to connect the facebook, youtube, wikipedia and your blog.
But recently I feel very sad. I suddenly come to an idea that many people in other countries don&#039;t like chinese. I&#039;ve been asked by some people from other countries again and again what sort of animals I eat, cat, dog?
I just don&#039;t know how to answer them because I have no idea of eating cats or dogs and I clearly remember the first time when I heard a phd student from germany saying that chinese eat everything during a summer school. 
In general, I feel extremely sad. I suffer from those questions. Their words often haunt me. 
I used to be a guy who has strong awareness of protecting animals and environment. But recently, I find that I am not welcomed at all. They will be surprised that a chinese show his mercy to animals.

Hopefully, you make progress in your field.

Best,]]></description>

You are right, the graph is about carbon, so my theory is wrong. 

The only other option I can come up with is that they made the same mistake and mislabeled the graph when in reality it shows carbon not carbon dioxide. The arrows sum to 1626 while 23% of 2004 global carbon emissions (7470) would be 1718, the difference could be due to other trade routes not included in the picture.]]></description>

I don’t know what the total anthropogenic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions were in 2004 but the Wikipedia graph seems to point to something around 7.5 gigatonnes, which is much closer to 6.2 than to the 25 gigatonnes you imply. 

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That graph shows gigatonnes of carbon, not carbon dioxide.  Each tonne of carbon burns to yield &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Carbon+emissions#carbon_versus_carbon_dioxide_3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;3.667&lt;/a&gt; tonnes of carbon dioxide.  The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eia.gov/emeu/international/carbondioxide.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Energy Information Administration&lt;/a&gt; says that in 2004, 27.4 gigatonnes of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; were emitted from burning fossil fuels.  That&#039;s corresponds to 7.47 gigatonnes of carbon.  So, it agrees with the Wikipedia graph.

When Davis and Caldeira wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

We find that, in 2004, 23% of global CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, or 6.2 gigatonnes CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, were traded internationally...

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I assumed they meant that if we take the 2004 global carbon dioxide emissions, and multiply them by 0.23, we&#039;ll get 6.2 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide.  Let me check that now!  

27.4 &#215; 0.23 = 6.3

Well, that&#039;s pretty close.  So, I still believe they&#039;re claiming that 6.2 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide were &quot;traded internationally&quot;.  And the arrows on that graph don&#039;t add up to anything like that.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/107/12/5687/F1.expansion.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;That graph&lt;/a&gt; claims to be about carbon dioxide, not carbon.  So I&#039;m still puzzled.

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/05/25/outsourcing-carbon-emissions/#comment-5942&quot;&gt;John Baez&lt;/a&gt;.

John: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;

That doesn’t make sense to me, because the authors say that in 2004, 23% of world-wide CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, or 6.2 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide, were associated to “international trade, primarily exports from China and other developing countries to rich countries”. Total CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  emissions were about 4 times more than that.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I don&#039;t know what the total anthropogenic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions were in 2004 but the Wikipedia graph seems to point to something around 7.5 gigatonnes, which is much closer to 6.2 than to the 25 gigatonnes you imply.

Hi!  I haven&#039;t heard from you in a while; I hope you&#039;re doing well.  Your name as it appears here on the blog looks a bit intimidating to people like me who can&#039;t read Chinese, so I&#039;ll remind people that you are &quot;Jing Xiaoyi&quot;.

I&#039;m not an expert on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Gorges_Dam&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Three Gorges Dam&lt;/a&gt;, though my wife was lucky enough to take a boat tour of the Yangtze River going through areas that are flooded by the dam now.

I hadn&#039;t known that the dam was blamed for droughts, but that&#039;s mentioned here:

&#8226; Mara Hvistendahl, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=chinas-three-gorges-dam-disaster&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;China&#039;s Three Gorges Dam: an environmental catastrophe?&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Scientific American&lt;/i&gt;, 25 March 2008.

and more recently here:

&#8226; David Stanway and Ken Wills, &lt;a href=&quot;http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/05/27/china-drought-threegorges-idUKL3E7GQ1GG20110527&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Q+A -- Is the Three Gorges Dam responsible for the Yangtze drought?&lt;/a&gt;, Reuters, 27 May 2011.

Since Reuters news articles tend to go away after a while, let me quote this one for you:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

A 200-day drought in central China has provoked a fierce debate among scientists and government researchers about the impact of big dams like the Three Gorges on local weather systems.

Government officials and experts have been forced to respond to a flurry of accusations by netizens and environmental activists that the world&#039;s biggest hydropower plant has disrupted downstream water flows and could have a long-term impact on local weather patterns.

WHY IS THE THREE GORGES BEING BLAMED?

Experts say that the 600-km (350-mile) long reservoir required to serve the 26 700-megawatt turbines at the Three Gorges hydropower plant prevents considerable volumes of water from flowing downstream.

But some environmentalists and climate specialists have also said that the reservoir acts as a giant heat reflector that affects the microclimate of the region, raising temperatures and reducing rainfall.

They also point to longer-term impact, saying that large reservoirs like the Three Gorges are net greenhouse gas producers because they submerged vast tracts of forest and farmland that would otherwise have absorbed climate-altering carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

WHAT HAS BEEN THE OFFICIAL RESPONSE?

Government experts have put the blame for this year&#039;s drought squarely on natural phenomena.

A statement issued on the government website (www.gov.cn) on Wednesday cited meteorologists as saying that seasonal high pressure from the northwest Pacific subtropical zone was weaker and more easterly than normal, and this was making it difficult for cold fronts to reach the downstream areas of the Yangtze.

Shen Guofang, an engineer involved in the design of the Three Gorges, acknowledge that the project has altered the climate in the region, but said the effects were confined to within 2 km (one mile) of the reservoir and it could not be blamed for the drought affecting downstream regions.

HAS THE DAM HELPED RELIEVE THE DROUGHT?

One of the main arguments in support of the project during its construction was its ability to regulate the water levels of the Yangtze, easing cross-country navigation, guaranteeing irrigation for millions of downstream farmers and taming a river responsible for the most calamitous floods in China&#039;s history.

Zheng Shouren of the China Academy of Engineering, also one of the dam&#039;s chief designers, told the official Xinhua news agency that the drought would have been much worse if not for the Three Gorges, noting that water stored in the reservoir had been used to raise downstream flows and irrigatge crops.

The reservoir is in the middle of a programme aimed at releasing billions of cubic metres of water downstream. The move will eventually reduce water levels at the Three Gorges Dam to 145 metres (450 feet), well below the 156 metres required to run all its turbines effectively.

But the release of emergency water supplies could cause problems. Guan Fengjun, director of the geological department at the Ministry of Land and Resources, told China National Radio that the drastic move could increase landslide risks as the torrent overwhelms the Yangtze&#039;s fragile banks.

WHAT DOES THE DEBATE MEAN?

The issue reflects a wider divide in government about large-scale hydropower as China tries to wean itself off polluting and climate-changing fossil fuels over the next decade.

Since the Three Gorges Dam was completed in 2005, China has approved no new large-scale hydropower plants. Premier Wen Jiabao, a geologist, is said to be sceptical about the massive financial, environmental and human costs of such projects.

The cabinet, chaired by Wen, concluded last week that while Three Gorges had provided benefits, it had also increased earthquake and landslide risks in the region and disrupted downstream irrigation.

But there are signs that hydropower is back in favour. Energy officials say new dams on the Yangtze upstream and elsewhere will be crucial in efforts to raise the proportion of non-fossil fuel energy to 15 percent of the total energy mix by 2020.

They say China will put another 140 gigawatts of hydropower capacity into construction before 2015, with big dam constructors eyeing Tibet, the Yangtze upstream and the previously untouched Nu River in the southwest. 

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The following article is a bit more interesting, though the remark about Mao and Tao sounds like the sort of stuff people write who haven&#039;t actually spent much time in China:

&#8226; Peter Bosshard, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-bosshard/lessons-from-three-gorges-dam-china_b_866495.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Mao, Tao and the Three Gorges Dam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Huffington Post&lt;/i&gt;, 26 May 2011.

&lt;blockquote&gt;

The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.internationalrivers.org/en/china/three-gorges-dam&quot; target=&quot;_hplink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Three Gorges Dam&lt;/a&gt; on the Yangtze River is the world&#039;s largest hydropower project. It has often been touted as a model for dam building around the world. Now the Chinese government has officially &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.internationalrivers.org/en/node/6521&quot; target=&quot;_hplink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;acknowledged&lt;/a&gt; the project&#039;s serious social, environmental and geological problems. What are the lessons from the Three Gorges experience?

&lt;p&gt;For many years, Chinese leaders have celebrated the mega-dam on the Yangtze as a symbol of the country&#039;s economic and technological progress. With a capacity of 18,200 megawatts, the hydropower project is indeed a masterpiece of engineering. In spite of its daunting complexity, the government completed it ahead of schedule in 2008. The dam generates two percent of China&#039;s electricity, and substitutes &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Gorges_Dam&quot; target=&quot;_hplink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;at least 30 million tons of coal&lt;/a&gt; per year. Its cost has been estimated at between $27 and $88 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Costs and benefits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The social and environmental costs may be even more staggering than the project&#039;s financial price tag. The Three Gorges Dam has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.internationalrivers.org/en/node/4740&quot; target=&quot;_hplink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;displaced&lt;/a&gt; more than 1.2 million people. Hundreds of local officials diverted compensation money into their own pockets, but protests against such abuses were &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.internationalrivers.org/chi/node/1902/&quot; target=&quot;_hplink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;suppressed&lt;/a&gt;. Because it no longer controls the economy and land is scarce, the government was not able to provide jobs and land to the displaced people as promised. Unlike other governments, China has set up a program to provide pensions to the 18 million people displaced by dams in the past. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Damming the Three Gorges caused massive impacts on the ecosystem of the Yangtze, Asia&#039;s longest river. The barrage stopped the migration of fish, and diminished the river&#039;s capacity to clean itself. Pollution from dirty industries along the reservoir is causing frequent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2009-05/25/content_7937675.htm&quot; target=&quot;_hplink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;toxic algae blooms&lt;/a&gt;. Commercial fisheries have plummeted, the Yangtze river dolphin has already been extinct, and species such as the Chinese Sturgeon are threatened by the same fate. Due to dam building and pollution, rivers and lakes around the world have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.internationalrivers.org/en/node/5371&quot; target=&quot;_hplink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;lost more species to extinction&lt;/a&gt; than any other major ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Struggling with unexpected impacts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the social and environmental problems had been predicted, government officials were not prepared for the massive geological impacts of the Three Gorges Dam. The water level in the reservoir fluctuates between 145 and 175 meters every year. This destabilizes the slopes of the Yangtze Valley, and is &lt;a href=&quot;http://english.caijing.com.cn/2009-04-29/110156140.html&quot; target=&quot;_hplink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;triggering frequent landslides&lt;/a&gt;. According to Chinese experts, erosion affects half the reservoir area, and more than 100 miles of riverbanks are at risk of collapsing. More than 300,000 additional people &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.internationalrivers.org/en/node/5016&quot; target=&quot;_hplink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;will have to be relocated&lt;/a&gt; to stabilize the banks of the reservoir. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since most of the silt load from the Yangtze&#039;s upper reaches is now deposited in the reservoir, the downstream regions are being starved of sediment. As a consequence, up to four square kilometers of coastal wetlands are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19025474.400-dam-puts-shanghai-wetlands-at-seas-mercy.html&quot; target=&quot;_hplink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;eroded every year&lt;/a&gt;. The Yangtze delta is subsiding, and seawater intrudes up the river, affecting agriculture and drinking water supplies. An international team of scientists &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.internationalrivers.org/en/node/5535&quot; target=&quot;_hplink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;recently found&lt;/a&gt; that no less than 472 million people have likely been affected by the downstream impacts of large dams around the world, and that these impacts are often neglected during the planning of such projects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists agree that the reservoirs of high dams can &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.internationalrivers.org/en/node/3845&quot; target=&quot;_hplink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;trigger earthquakes&lt;/a&gt;. The Three Gorges Dam sits on two fault lines, and hundreds of small tremors have been recorded since the reservoir began filling. While the dam has been built to withstand strong earthquakes, the villages and towns in its vicinity have not. As global dam building increasingly moves into mountain areas with active tectonic faults, the seismic risks of reservoirs will increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hydropower projects have often been proposed as a response to global warming, yet the Three Gorges Dam illustrates how climate change creates &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.internationalrivers.org/en/node/1579&quot; target=&quot;_hplink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;new risks for such projects&lt;/a&gt;. In a nutshell, past records can no longer be used to predict a river&#039;s future streamflow. The dam operators planned to fill the Three Gorges reservoir for the first time in 2009, but were not able to do so due to insufficient rains. The current year has brought Central China the worst drought in 50 years. Like other projects around the world, the Three Gorges Dam is facing serious risks and losses due to the vagaries of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new approach is needed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists had warned of the Three Gorges Dam&#039;s impacts throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Yet their opinions were ignored and silenced. During the construction phase, the giant project, which had originally been championed by Mao Zedong, was frequently visited by government and party leaders. It has also served as a tour stop for many &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.internationalrivers.org/en/node/4298&quot; target=&quot;_hplink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;visiting government delegations&lt;/a&gt; from Asia, Africa and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the Chinese government has quietly toned down its enthusiasm for the project. &quot;We thought of all the possible issues,&quot; the secretary general of the Yangtze River Forum &lt;a href=&quot;http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118824657324010144.html&quot; target=&quot;_hplink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; in August 2007. &quot;But the problems are all more serious than we expected.&quot; When the dam was inaugurated in 2008, the Chinese president and his prime minister were conspicuously absent. And on May 18, China&#039;s highest government body for the first time &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gov.cn/ldhd/2011-05/18/content_1866289.htm&quot; target=&quot;_hplink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;acknowledged the serious problems&lt;/a&gt; at the Three Gorges. &quot;The project is now greatly benefiting the society in the aspects of flood prevention, power generation, river transportation and water resource utilization,&quot; the government maintained, but it has &quot;caused some urgent problems in terms of environmental protection, the prevention of geological hazards and the welfare of the relocated communities.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China&#039;s economy is booming, and its water and energy needs are pressing. Yet the Three Gorges Dam was not the only option for replacing coal. While the dam was under construction, the country&#039;s economy actually became more wasteful in its use of energy. According to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newsweek.com/2006/02/05/we-don-t-need-more-power.html&quot; target=&quot;_hplink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Energy Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, it would have been &quot;cheaper, cleaner and more productive for China to have invested in energy efficiency&quot; rather than new power plants. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few hundred miles from the Three Gorges reservoir, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dujiangyan&quot; target=&quot;_hplink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;water works of Dujiangyan&lt;/a&gt; have irrigated the fertile Sichuan plains and prevented floods through an ingenious system of levees for more than 2000 years. They reflect the Taoist philosophy of working with the forces of nature, while the Yangtze dam symbolizes the Maoist (and Confucian) approach of subduing the natural world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Three Gorges Dam has been completed, but it is not too late to draw lessons for the mega-projects which have been proposed on the Mekong and the Amazon, the Congo and the Salween, in Ethiopia and the Himalayas. The Yangtze dam demonstrates that even with the greatest technical skills, our power to dominate nature is limited. It calls on us to harness our great technological progress for solutions that reduce poverty while respecting the limits of our ecosystems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By the way, I&#039;ll be visiting Jilin University for a &lt;a href=&quot;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2011/04/higher_structures_in_china_ii.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;math workshop in August&lt;/a&gt;, and the organizers have planned a camping trip near Changbai Mountain.  I&#039;m really looking forward to it!

Pollution from dirty industries along the reservoir is causing frequent <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2009-05/25/content_7937675.htm" target="_hplink" rel="nofollow">toxic algae blooms</a>. Commercial fisheries have plummeted, the Yangtze river dolphin has already been extinct, and species such as the Chinese Sturgeon are threatened by the same fate. Due to dam building and pollution, rivers and lakes around the world have <a href="http://www.internationalrivers.org/en/node/5371" target="_hplink" rel="nofollow">lost more species to extinction</a> than any other major ecosystem. </p>
<p><strong>Struggling with unexpected impacts</strong></p>
<p>While the social and environmental problems had been predicted, government officials were not prepared for the massive geological impacts of the Three Gorges Dam. The water level in the reservoir fluctuates between 145 and 175 meters every year. This destabilizes the slopes of the Yangtze Valley, and is <a href="http://english.caijing.com.cn/2009-04-29/110156140.html" target="_hplink" rel="nofollow">triggering frequent landslides</a>. According to Chinese experts, erosion affects half the reservoir area, and more than 100 miles of riverbanks are at risk of collapsing. More than 300,000 additional people <a href="http://www.internationalrivers.org/en/node/5016" target="_hplink" rel="nofollow">will have to be relocated</a> to stabilize the banks of the reservoir. </p>
<p>Since most of the silt load from the Yangtze&#8217;s upper reaches is now deposited in the reservoir, the downstream regions are being starved of sediment. As a consequence, up to four square kilometers of coastal wetlands are <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19025474.400-dam-puts-shanghai-wetlands-at-seas-mercy.html" target="_hplink" rel="nofollow">eroded every year</a>. The Yangtze delta is subsiding, and seawater intrudes up the river, affecting agriculture and drinking water supplies. An international team of scientists <a href="http://www.internationalrivers.org/en/node/5535" target="_hplink" rel="nofollow">recently found</a> that no less than 472 million people have likely been affected by the downstream impacts of large dams around the world, and that these impacts are often neglected during the planning of such projects. </p>
<p>Scientists agree that the reservoirs of high dams can <a href="http://www.internationalrivers.org/en/node/3845" target="_hplink" rel="nofollow">trigger earthquakes</a>. The Three Gorges Dam sits on two fault lines, and hundreds of small tremors have been recorded since the reservoir began filling. While the dam has been built to withstand strong earthquakes, the villages and towns in its vicinity have not. As global dam building increasingly moves into mountain areas with active tectonic faults, the seismic risks of reservoirs will increase.</p>
<p>Hydropower projects have often been proposed as a response to global warming, yet the Three Gorges Dam illustrates how climate change creates <a href="http://www.internationalrivers.org/en/node/1579" target="_hplink" rel="nofollow">new risks for such projects</a>. In a nutshell, past records can no longer be used to predict a river&#8217;s future streamflow. The dam operators planned to fill the Three Gorges reservoir for the first time in 2009, but were not able to do so due to insufficient rains. The current year has brought Central China the worst drought in 50 years. Like other projects around the world, the Three Gorges Dam is facing serious risks and losses due to the vagaries of climate change.</p>
<p><strong>A new approach is needed</strong></p>
<p>Scientists had warned of the Three Gorges Dam&#8217;s impacts throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Yet their opinions were ignored and silenced. During the construction phase, the giant project, which had originally been championed by Mao Zedong, was frequently visited by government and party leaders. It has also served as a tour stop for many <a href="http://www.internationalrivers.org/en/node/4298" target="_hplink" rel="nofollow">visiting government delegations</a> from Asia, Africa and Europe.</p>
<p>In recent years, the Chinese government has quietly toned down its enthusiasm for the project. &#8220;We thought of all the possible issues,&#8221; the secretary general of the Yangtze River Forum <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118824657324010144.html" target="_hplink" rel="nofollow">told</a> the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> in August 2007. &#8220;But the problems are all more serious than we expected.&#8221; When the dam was inaugurated in 2008, the Chinese president and his prime minister were conspicuously absent. And on May 18, China&#8217;s highest government body for the first time <a href="http://www.gov.cn/ldhd/2011-05/18/content_1866289.htm" target="_hplink" rel="nofollow">acknowledged the serious problems</a> at the Three Gorges. &#8220;The project is now greatly benefiting the society in the aspects of flood prevention, power generation, river transportation and water resource utilization,&#8221; the government maintained, but it has &#8220;caused some urgent problems in terms of environmental protection, the prevention of geological hazards and the welfare of the relocated communities.&#8221;</p>
<p>China&#8217;s economy is booming, and its water and energy needs are pressing. Yet the Three Gorges Dam was not the only option for replacing coal. While the dam was under construction, the country&#8217;s economy actually became more wasteful in its use of energy. According to the <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/2006/02/05/we-don-t-need-more-power.html" target="_hplink" rel="nofollow">Energy Foundation</a>, it would have been &#8220;cheaper, cleaner and more productive for China to have invested in energy efficiency&#8221; rather than new power plants. </p>
<p>A few hundred miles from the Three Gorges reservoir, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dujiangyan" target="_hplink" rel="nofollow">water works of Dujiangyan</a> have irrigated the fertile Sichuan plains and prevented floods through an ingenious system of levees for more than 2000 years. They reflect the Taoist philosophy of working with the forces of nature, while the Yangtze dam symbolizes the Maoist (and Confucian) approach of subduing the natural world. </p>
<p>The Three Gorges Dam has been completed, but it is not too late to draw lessons for the mega-projects which have been proposed on the Mekong and the Amazon, the Congo and the Salween, in Ethiopia and the Himalayas. The Yangtze dam demonstrates that even with the greatest technical skills, our power to dominate nature is limited. It calls on us to harness our great technological progress for solutions that reduce poverty while respecting the limits of our ecosystems. </p>

<p>By the way, I&#8217;ll be visiting Jilin University for a <a href="http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2011/04/higher_structures_in_china_ii.html" rel="nofollow">math workshop in August</a>, and the organizers have planned a camping trip near Changbai Mountain.  I&#8217;m really looking forward to it!</p>
