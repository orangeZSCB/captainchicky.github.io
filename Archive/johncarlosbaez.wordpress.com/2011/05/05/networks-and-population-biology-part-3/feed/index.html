I believe that you&#039;re right John, the phylogenetic operad is that coproduct.  Perhaps an interesting question to ask is: for which operads $latex \mathcal{O}$ do the coproducts $latex \mathcal{O} + I$ have a natural CAT(0) metric?

I agree with Tom that the W-construction is the suboperad of the coproduct which has root and `twig&#039; (I assume this means an edge adjacent to a leaf) length 1, though being picky I should point out that we need to be in the category of topological spaces rather than sets for it to be a true W-construction.]]></description>

Thanks, Tom.  That paper of yours really helps.  I now believe the phylogenetic operad is the coproduct (in the category of symmetric operads) of the operad for commutative algebras (which we&#039;ve been calling Com here) and the additive monoid [0,&#8734;) (regarded as an operad with only unary operations).  This description seems quite useful to me: as usual, I&#039;m scheming and dreaming.]]></description>

I gave a link to this article at the very beginning of my blog entry here.  It&#039;s a very fun read for the geometrically inclined.

Holmes has also made her slides available, so I&#039;ve added a link:

I&#039;m too fuzzy right now to think straight, but if you&#039;re interested in slight variants of the W construction, you might be interested in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.maths.gla.ac.uk/~tl/w.ps&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this old note&lt;/a&gt;.  Maybe you&#039;ve already answered the question to your satisfaction, though.]]></description>

Thanks very much, James!   I now think I was confused and you are right about everything -- except possibly whether we &#039;should&#039; label the leaf edges, which is a moral/practical question rather than a question about mathematical facts.  

This is really great!  I&#039;m going to have to work up a talk on &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/math/9803156&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&#039;grafting cherry trees to phylogenetic trees&#039;&lt;/a&gt; or something like that.  I remember now that when I first read Boardman and Vogt&#039;s book I was really confused about whether W(Com) was an E&lt;sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&#8734;&lt;/sub&gt; operad; when I realized it was not I decided it was worthless and never looked back.  But now I know what it&#039;s good for!

To settle the moral/practical question about whether leaf edges should come with lengths we have two guiding criteria, which I was calling the &#039;truth of biology&#039; and the &#039;truth of operads&#039; (or more generally the criterion of mathematical elegance).  Maybe they&#039;ll pull in different directions, but I think ultimately there&#039;s a single beautiful story here.  It may involve a number of different operads and other things.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;

So you’re on the side of operadic truth...

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yes, as you know I usually try to be on the side of the truth&#8212;and here the operadic truth and the biological truth coincide, which is a good sign.  

Thanks for quoting the paper by Holmes &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt;. I&#039;d forgotten that the factor they deliberately neglect is not just topologically $latex \mathbb{R}^n$, but geometrically &lt;i&gt;Euclidean&lt;/i&gt; $latex \mathbb{R}^n$.  That makes their neglect entirely justifiable, since they can undo it at a moment&#039;s notice.  They&#039;re just trying to focus on the geometrically &lt;i&gt;exciting&lt;/i&gt; aspects of treespace.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I love the way you head off in search of green maths, and yet keep knocking up against 2-monads, operads, and the like. A case of reaching for familiar tools, or perhaps good green maths is a subset of the highly interconnected realm of good maths, so it’s likely you’ll never stray too far from the old favourites.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I&#039;m of mixed minds about it&#8212;I&#039;m not sure I &#039;love&#039; it.  Sometimes I feel I&#039;m stuck in a rut so deep that even my most energetic attempts to do something practical keep sinking back into the comfortable routine of useless but elegant abstraction.  

However, my more considered opinion is that lots of structures developed for use in pure mathematics and hard-core &#039;fundamental&#039; theoretical physics are in fact sufficiently general as to turn up all over the place... and when I see them, I should point them out, because it can&#039;t hurt much, and it might even help.   

I want pure mathematicians to get interested in practical things like biology in the same sort of way they&#039;re already interested in fairly useless things like elementary particle physics.   Knowing there&#039;s an operad or two lurking in biology may help get them interested.]]></description>
