I get the exact opposite impression from reading Jaynes. In that chapter, he simply showed where Newtonian determinism becomes important.  I say let the coin bounce on concrete and have them do the experiment again. :)]]></description>

Thanks, David!  I see from some examples that Cannings&#039; payoff matrices are neither symmetric ($latex A_{ij} = A_{ji}$) nor antisymmetric ($latex A_{ij} = -A_{ji}$). 

I know Cannings said something about the games being &#039;symmetrical&#039;.  My math brain unthinkingly transcribed this remark into the equation $latex A_{ij} = A_{ji}$.  But I think what he really means is that there&#039;s no inherent concept of the &#039;first player&#039; and &#039;second player&#039; in the game.  

For example, two rams walk up to each other and start ramming each other.  Each is free to pick any strategy, and if Rambo picks strategy $latex i$ while Slambo picks strategy $latex j$, then Rambo&#039;s expected winnings are $latex A_{ij}$ while Slambo&#039;s are $latex A_{ji}$.  This is a simplification compared to the real world, because in the real world one ram might be designated the &#039;defender of territory&#039; and one designated the &#039;attacker&#039;, and they might have different choices of strategies based on this, or different payoffs.   If we drop this simplifying assumption we should use two matrices, as you explained. 

So, I&#039;ll get rid of that equation!  Thanks.]]></description>

Looking at the eventual wikipedia page on &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payoff_matrix&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;payoff matrixes&lt;/a&gt;, it seems like one common way to describe things is in terms of a pair of matrices A -- describing player 1&#039;s winnings from a pair of actions -- and B -- describing player 2&#039;s winnings from a pair of actions. Although the framework seems perfectly capable of describing games where A and B are arbitrary, it&#039;s interesting that all the examples I&#039;ve found on wikipedia obey the rules $latex A=B^T$, so that the differential change (ie, how much better off player 1 is than player 2 after the encounter) matrix $latex A-B$ is anti-symmetric matrix. In these relative terms the example above is still suitably anti-symmetric since if both go off the cliff there&#039;s 0 relatitve change. I&#039;m still suspicious of symmetries, although I can&#039;t right now think of a situation where in these relative terms there&#039;s an (anti-)symmetry violation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Is there a typo after &quot;We assume the game is symmetrical&quot;: should it be $latex A_{ij}=-A_{ji}$? Otherwise swapping the strategies chosen by the two players doesn&#039;t affect player 1&#039;s &quot;winnings&quot;.

I noticed that because I find it fascinating that very few people comment on how strong an assumption &quot;We assume the game is symmetrical&quot; is, and how tricky it is to justify that completely in non invented-game/financial situations. Often games are designed with some conserved quantity, often money, so that the amount one individual gains is equal to the amount another individual loses. However, in more general situations not all actions satisfy this constraint. Eg, let&#039;s put on our leather jackets and take off our modern liberal values to go to a &quot;Rebel without a cause&quot; world where the winner of a game of chicken &quot;gets the girl&quot;. Even if we accept that the loser &quot;loses his chance with one from a limited pool of girls&quot;, so that we can argue there&#039;s an appropriate notion of &quot;player 1 winnings=-player 2 winnings&quot;, there&#039;s an extreme case where both players cut it too fine and go over the cliff. (Ok, this requires adding a probabilistic/skill/whatever ingredient to the model, but you get the point...) Then in that extreme case &quot;player 1 winnings=player 2 winnings=loss of all future girl opportunities&quot;, contrary to the general zero-sum balance in the game. So the (generalised) A matrix is no-longer either symmetrical or anti-symmmetrical but a mixture of both.

The thing that I&#039;m interested in is that clearly symmetries are a powerful constraints that happen to actually apply in most systems in &quot;pure physics&quot;, but do we use them in other models more because we like their power than because they&#039;re justified?]]></description>

I remember chatting once with Persi at a conference in Mykonos about our mutual appreciation for Edwin Jaynes. Read chapter 10 of his &lt;a href=&quot;http://omega.albany.edu:8008/JaynesBook.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; to convince yourself that randomness really isn&#039;t in the world, save perhaps for quantum mechanics. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;

...anyone familiar with the law of conservation of angular momentum can, after some practice, cheat as the usual coin-toss game and call his shots with 100 per cent accuracy. You can obtain any frequency of heads you want; and &lt;i&gt;the bias of the coin has no influence at all on the results!&lt;/i&gt;
