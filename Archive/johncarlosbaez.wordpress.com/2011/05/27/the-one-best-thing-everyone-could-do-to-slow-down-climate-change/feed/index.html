Oh! Gaviotas, Colombia and Paolo Lugari... Stuff for Plan C. Another more extreme vision I have is reforesting Haiti (starting near the Dominican Republic&#039;s border for food and soil supply and forest nursery), seeded by small scattered extreme-eco communities.

We need billions of folks living in sustainable &quot;eco&quot; villages. They are the future&#039;s carbon sequestrators (biochar, forest gardens). (If hominids are any interested in any future...) Plus, they provide food security for the poor and escape from the megacities.

Agriculture is the key to the future, biogeophysiologically as well as socially. A parallel world in symbiosis with megalopolis.]]></description>

Yes, one additional acre per $200K. I am talking about the same thing.

But, as I said, it can be anywhere on the planet. I see little reason, for example, why one could not continue doing what Lugari did in Colombia on a much larger scale.]]></description>

I think the two things I&#039;d point to are the need to return an *additional* half acre of land to wilderness to become mature self-sustaining forest, for *every* $100K a business earns.   Say the business you&#039;re going to sequester the carbon of is &quot;the world economy&quot;, with its $60t income to compensate for.   At the world average CO2 production rate that would require a permanent set-aside of 600billion acres of high quality new forest land a year, and more than that if it costs any money to do it.

Things that are out of scale with our familiar units are indeed hard to catch on to at first, as nearly everything about a perpetual global growth system becomes.   For this one you&#039;d need to then look and see exactly what lands would be used for the set-aside, and whether any expense would be involved.   600billion acres a year to set aside sounds to me like quite a lot.]]></description>

Eric, you need to look at the fabric of science, not try to remake your image of nature from the tiny weaving back and forth of its threads...    

Whenever people try to see nature as fitting their images they nearly always succeed, but then find more and more other things around them they have to explain that they have no evidence for (like the possibility of a broad conspiracy to politicize their data within some disciplines of science, that nearly all other scientists take no interest in, etc. ).   

That becomes an endless expanding chore that produces no result but frustration, rather the opposite.   The task that absorbs science is the question of how to settle questions, rather than how to keep getting more and more lost in discrepancies trying to defend preferred beliefs.]]></description>

Thomas, I haven&#039;t yet asked who said Bavarian is. Somewhere near Passau.]]></description>

Florifulgurator,

Who in Bavaria are you talking about? (Incidentally, I am a Bavarian, too.)

Maybe I should add that repairing ecosystems can be learned; there is a lot of information out there, and there are numerous people with a lot of practical experience. When I&#039;m not busy with my University work, I&#039;m also experimenting with some techniques, giving courses, and doing a few other things to spread knowledge about what can be done.]]></description>

Thomas, looks you got quite the same grand picture as I have.

Your restoration teams (precursors of the repair species Homo Eusapiens) are at the heart of my Plan C. They not only produce forests (e.g. reforesting Haiti). There&#039;s enough depleted/mineralized agricultural land in need of a buildup of humus.

As you demonstrated, restoration teams make economic/investment sense even in today&#039;s framework. (Phil can add more). Here in Bavaria there exists at least one rich man who invests in agricultural land and might want to lend it to a restoration team. (From the global ecosystem perspective, restoration means natural carbon sequestration by building up soil carbon. That can be anywhere, even on relatively good agricultural land. Use biochar to speed this up and make carbon sequestration more stable and less vulnerable to climate weirding.)

But there&#039;s also an individual economic incentive to join a restoration team: &lt;i&gt;Food sovereignty&lt;/i&gt; independent of money (pension funds, etc.)

Ethic reasons to join or support a restoration team would also be abundant. (E.g. I wonder when Mahayana Buddhists will form restoration teams en masse, noting the fundamental challenge to their ethics of compassion with life: Not carbon negative, no bodhisattva. Not carbon negative, no sangha.)]]></description>

There is a slight oops in my above posting. Obviously, one must not count the expenses for land twice. So, let&#039;s just (conservatively) forget about wages as well and say you spent $20000 to make a donation worth $100000 which gives you a tax break of $25000. Effectively earned $5000.]]></description>
