The server hosting math.ucr.edu went down about 3 weeks ago due to a power outage, along with all other computers at U. C. Riverside.  Unfortunately this particular server was unable to reboot so they had to replace it.  The machine has been replaced, but only yesterday was I able to log in and tell them where in the directory hierarchy my website was located, so they could make it visible to the world.   They are trying to do that now.  So, in a few hours, or days, or weeks, my website and all the images it hosts should reappear.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;strong&gt;Bohemian eigenvalues&lt;/strong&gt; are the distribution of the eigenvalues of a random matrix. More specifically, this article explores matrices of low dimension (typically no larger than 10 &#215; 10) whose entries are integers of bounded height. The name “Bohemian” is intended as a mnemonic and is derived from “Bounded Height Integer Matrix Eigenvalues” (BHIME). Here I present an overview of some preliminary results arising from this project.]]></description>

I coloured each pixel depending on how many roots landed in that 1pixel x 1pixel square. You can try various gradients, mine goes from white (for highest density) to yellow to orange to black (for 0 density). It&#039;s important to have the resolution of the image match the number of roots: if you have too few roots for a given resolution, pixels would tend to not contain enough roots, and you can&#039;t do much with that with the colouring.]]></description>

Hi Sam, I&#039;m trying to re-create the image but can not make it as beautiful as yours, I think the problem is with my coloring scheme. Could you explain me how did you color the roots?]]></description>

If the email address you used in your comment is valid, I can send Sam your comment and your email address.  Or, perhaps &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kcl.ac.uk/nms/depts/mathematics/people/phdstudents.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this email address&lt;/a&gt; will work for him.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[John Baez:

Nice post, very nice, I draw also something for a student with a source code

And maybe you are interested in the graph of the polynomials in R2 to understand better what is happening in the closure.

Here are all the pictures and source code
