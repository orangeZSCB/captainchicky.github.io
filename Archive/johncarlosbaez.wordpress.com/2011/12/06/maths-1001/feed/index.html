					<description><![CDATA[There was a two-year gap between seeing this post and me acting on it, but I wanted to add another positive review for this book. I got it for my daughters for Christmas, and it was a coffee table book for a while. Recently, it has migrated to one of my daughter&#039;s personal bookshelves. If you knew anything about this girl&#039;s history with mathematics, you&#039;d know how remarkable that is. So thanks for pointing this out -- would never have found it on my own.]]></description>
