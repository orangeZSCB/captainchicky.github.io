					<description><![CDATA[A fairly quick way to suppress tundra warming is through SO2 aerosols lofted by planes in the Arctic summer. Cost I estimated 6 years ago at $200 million to $300 million yearly.

I still find it significant, if not alarming. (It&#039;s tough to be alarmed by confirmations of something expected like global climate change.)]]></description>

Or a new type of behavior in the global climatological system characterized by rapid (decades-scale) change, similar to the familiar phase transitions observed in many nonlinear dynamical systems precludes &#039;people&#039; from doing anything at all. Happy Holidays!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Over on Google+, Stewart Brand pointed out this article &quot;putting the new methane findings is somewhat less alarming context&quot;:

&#8226; Andrew Revkin, &lt;a href=&quot;http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/05/the-heat-over-bubbling-arctic-methane/?src=tp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The heat over bubbling Arctic methane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Dot Earth&lt;/i&gt;, 3 March 2010 (updated 11 December 2011).

Ed Dlugokencky, quoted here, works for NOAA and has been studying the rise in atmospheric methane concentrations for some time.  He doesn&#039;t think we&#039;re close to a tipping point, but he does believe the worldwide rise in atmospheric concentrations is linked to the warming of northern regions:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/44597000/gif/_44597184_methane_gr466.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/44597000/gif/_44597184_methane_gr466.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

In a BBC article from 2008 he&#039;s quoted as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Ed Dlugokencky, the scientist at Noaa&#039;s Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL) who collates and analyses data from atmospheric monitoring stations, agrees that the 2007 rise has a biological cause.

&quot;We&#039;re pretty sure it&#039;s not biomass burning; and I think 2007 is probably down to wetland emissions,&quot; he said.

&quot;In boreal regions it was warmer and wetter than usual, and microbes there produce methane faster at higher temperatures.&quot;

Dr Dlugokencky also suggested that the drastic reduction in summer sea ice around the Arctic between 2006 and 2007 could have increased release of methane from seawater into the atmosphere. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Giant plumes of methane gas being released in the arctic sea is just very bad news.  These very potent feedback effects kicking in earlier than we thought means we will have less time to respond.

You&#039;re right.  But as I&#039;ve said before, this blog is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; about trying to stir masses of people into political action.  It&#039;s about trying to get scientists and engineers interested in figuring out what&#039;s going on, and figuring out things we can do.  

I don&#039;t expect &lt;i&gt;most&lt;/i&gt; people to get excited about methane bubbling up from the Arctic ocean: at least, not for long enough to do anything.  But we need to understand the role of permafrost and gas hydrates in global warming.  This discovery by Semiletov is important.  And it&#039;s exactly the sort of thing that can make some kids want to become scientists and take a trip on that boat off the East Siberian coast, to figure out what&#039;s going on.  My blogging used to attract lots of students to quantum gravity and n-categories.  Now it&#039;s environmental issues, complex systems, and the like.

By the way, the mathematician &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.math.utah.edu/~golden/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Kenneth Golden&lt;/a&gt; has the greatest way to attract students that I&#039;ve ever seen: he shows them what it&#039;s like to ride through a storm on a ship headed for Antarctica!  He works on the mathematics and physics of sea ice.  There&#039;s nothing like this to dispel the myth that math is for wimps:

You’re asking governments to make a significant redirection of the global economy, with concomitant and extreme dislocations in the lives of hundreds of millions of people, in order to forestall or prevent a 4 degree Fahrenheit rise in average temperature by 30 years from now.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I don&#039;t recall asking governments anything.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
First of all, who cares about the average annual temp going up by 4degF? 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Are you asking for a list?  Here&#039;s one:

&#8226; Wynne Perry, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livescience.com/17340-agu-climate-sensitivity-nasa-hansen.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;2 degrees of warming a recipe for disaster, NASA scientist says&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Live Science&lt;/i&gt;, 6 December 2011.

Just kidding---I know your question was rhetorical.  

Anyway, I don&#039;t think masses of people will take radical action unless and until things are getting worse at a noticeable rate and they feel these actions are likely to make things better.  

It&#039;s possible that this will never happen, even if things get really bad.  If things get bad slowly enough and it always seems hard to do anything useful, there may never come a moment where people rally and take action.  

Or, it&#039;s possible that things will get bad and then people will desperately grab for something that seems like a quick fix, say geoengineering.

Or, it&#039;s possible that things don&#039;t get &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; bad: we just muddle through.

Or, it&#039;s possible that more and more people will see that we have a growing problem that we can address by taking significant action.  Scientists and engineers can help prepare a menu of options: what&#039;s possible, what&#039;s not.

It sounds like you&#039;re criticizing me because you feel you&#039;re doing something more immediately practical.  I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if you were---practicality was never my strong point!  What are you doing?]]></description>

Arrow has nailed it. It is not improbable that the time will come when global warming is as natural as it is anthropogenic today. It would by then be quite undeniable.

I have some hope that by then hominin technologists will no longer feel offended upon suggestions of implementing some stone age technology (char coal production and agricultural sequestration) to balance the carbon budget. (With luck they could happily play with improved Imbert gasifiers plugged to a micro gas turbine or placed in a plain old Toyota Prius... and exchange the char for food.)  I have less hope they will devise a monetary system to foster such economic activity...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/12/14/melting-permafrost-part-2/#comment-11812&quot;&gt;Arrow&lt;/a&gt;.

The not-so-tiny increases in Arctic ocean temperatures have caused a quite stunning decrease in Arctic sea ice volume, as shown in this graph using data from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://psc.apl.washington.edu/wordpress/research/projects/arctic-sea-ice-volume-anomaly/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/2011/09/piomas-august-2011.html#more&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b015435378281970c-800wi&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This decrease in volume is much more rapid than the decrease in area; the reason must be that ice is melting beneath the surface.   I&#039;ve heard it said this is caused by new warm currents coming into the Arctic Ocean.  So, it&#039;s at least conceivable that permafrost is also starting to melt at the ocean floor.  But I think people need to study this: obviously you can&#039;t jump from data about melting ice near the surface to melting ice near the sea floor.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It can even be seen as reassuring in the sense that discovering huge previously unaccounted for (or at least not fully) natural sources of greenhouse gasses makes our own contributions carry less relative weight.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sorry, it&#039;s not very hard to measure how much methane is in the Arctic atmosphere; we knew there were mysterious sources of the stuff.   We also know how much of the current global warming is due to human sources of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  There will be moderate corrections to this picture as we continue to learn more, but nothing &#039;huge&#039; or &#039;reassuring&#039;.  

There&#039;s a nice new paper on this subject, just one of many:

And clearly, if higher temperatures trigger more methane releases from permafrost on land and the sea floor, this will make matters &lt;i&gt;worse&lt;/i&gt;, not better. ]]></description>

<p>The not-so-tiny increases in Arctic ocean temperatures have caused a quite stunning decrease in Arctic sea ice volume, as shown in this graph using data from the <a href="http://psc.apl.washington.edu/wordpress/research/projects/arctic-sea-ice-volume-anomaly/" rel="nofollow">Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System</a>:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/2011/09/piomas-august-2011.html#more" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://neven1.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f03a1e37970b015435378281970c-800wi" /></a></div>
<p>This decrease in volume is much more rapid than the decrease in area; the reason must be that ice is melting beneath the surface.   I&#8217;ve heard it said this is caused by new warm currents coming into the Arctic Ocean.  So, it&#8217;s at least conceivable that permafrost is also starting to melt at the ocean floor.  But I think people need to study this: obviously you can&#8217;t jump from data about melting ice near the surface to melting ice near the sea floor.</p>

It can even be seen as reassuring in the sense that discovering huge previously unaccounted for (or at least not fully) natural sources of greenhouse gasses makes our own contributions carry less relative weight.
