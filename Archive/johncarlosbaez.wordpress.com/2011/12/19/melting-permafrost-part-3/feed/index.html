Russian scientists have recently found more new craters in Siberia, apparently formed by explosions of methane.  Three were found last summer.  They looked for more using satellite photos... and found more!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Judith Curry yesterday posted an &lt;a href=&quot;http://judithcurry.com/2011/12/20/arctic-update-ii/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Arctic Update.&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
What is going on with the Arctic climate is not straightforward to understand.  Recent attribution studies ... have argued that the warming in recent decades, along with the sea ice decrease, is approximately half natural, half anthropogenic ...  The challenge is to sort out the following:
 
■Solar and volcanic impacts
■Ocean heat transport
■Arctic teleconnection regimes (e.g. AO)
■Aerosol and GHG effects
■Feedbacks initiated by all of the above

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/12/19/melting-permafrost-part-3/#comment-11983&quot;&gt;Speed&lt;/a&gt;.

Okay, I&#039;ve corrected my post.  I thought it would take about 3&#176;C of warming to push us up above the temperatures we&#039;ve seen recorded in ice cores.  From the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ice_Age_Temperature.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;graph you linked to&lt;/a&gt; that seems roughly right if we believe the Vostok ice core... but the EPICA ice core makes it look more like 6&#176;C. Of course the International Energy Agency says in its &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iea.org/weo/docs/weo2011/pressrelease.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;2011 World Energy Outlook&lt;/a&gt; that: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the New Policies Scenario, cumulative CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions over the next 25 years amount to three-quarters of the total from the past 110 years, leading to a long-term average temperature rise of 3.5°C. China&#039;s per-capita emissions match the OECD average in 2035.  Were the new policies not implemented, we are on an even more dangerous track, to an increase of 6°C.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Being a pessimist, I consider a 6&#176;C rise perfectly plausible over the next century or two.  But anyway, my sentence was misleading, and this whole issue of whether we surpass previous interglacials is not quite relevant to my main point, namely that we should learn more about melting permafrost and its effects... so I&#039;ve rewritten it.  Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[John Baez wrote, &quot;However, now the Earth is starting to warm beyond what was seen in previous interglacial periods.&quot;

I&#039;m not trying to be argumentative, stupid or difficult but I tend to question throw-away statements that are assumed and can have a big effect on a discussion. In this case, I jumped to Wikipedia where I found the following,
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Antarctic temperature records indicate that the present interglacial is relatively cool compared to previous interglacials, at least at these sites. The Liesecki &#038; Raymo (2005) sediment reconstruction does not indicate significant differences between modern ice volume and previous interglacials, though some other studies do report slightly lower ice volumes / higher sea levels during the 120 ka and 400 ka interglacials (Karner et al. 2001, Hearty and Kaufman 2000).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Qualified with the statement,
&lt;blockquote&gt;However, since geological records such as ice cores and sediments represent an average often on the scale of thousands of years, direct comparison to current values can be misleading. Larger, short term variations in ancient climate are not present in the fossil record. Hence the comparison is not comparing like with like and is scientifically invalid.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ice_Age_Temperature.png

My conclusion from five minutes of specific research (and years of experience) is that we don&#039;t really know how the earth&#039;s current &quot;temperature&quot; compares with that of previous interglacial periods. Contradictory evidence is welcome.

As always, thanks for the interesting post.]]></description>
