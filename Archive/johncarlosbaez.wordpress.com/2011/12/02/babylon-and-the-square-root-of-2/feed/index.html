Sorry to comment on an ancient post, but I see this interpretation of Robson repeated again and again, and it frustrates me.  Plimpton 322 can&#039;t literally be a table of Pythagorean triples, not least because it only contains one of the sides and the diagonal, rather than both sides and the diagonal.  But are you claiming that the author of the tablet didn&#039;t think of the numbers it contains as having to do with exact side lengths of right triangles (or of rectangles with their diagonal)?  I don&#039;t think Robson&#039;s article supports that.  I can&#039;t think of &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; scholar who says that&#8212;even Friberg, who states in his book &lt;i&gt;A Remarkable Collection of Babylonian Mathematical Texts&lt;/i&gt;that the numbers in columns 2 and 3 shouldn&#039;t be thought of as integer side lengths, still thinks the tablet is connected with right triangles.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So one of the oldest records of square roots in history would be The Old Babylonian tablet YBC 7289, which dates back anywhere from 2000-1600 BC. It depicts a square with two diagonals drawn and on the diagonals are numbers; when they are calculated, you get a very close approximation of the square root of 2 for the diagonal. Their value for the square root of two was about 1.41421297; I could have my students quickly calculate the square root of two (about 1.41421356) and mention to my students that this is pretty impressive for a civilization without modern day technology. The fact that they used clay tablets for math calculations shows how little they had to work with. Yet Babylon was also one of the most famous ancient cities in Mesopotamia; it’s mentioned multiple times in the bible and they were pretty advanced in mathematics for their area, despite the lack of resources we have today. They used a sexagesimal number system, which is base 60; they could solve algebra problems and work with what we now call Pythagorean triples; they could also solve equations with cubes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/12/02/babylon-and-the-square-root-of-2/#comment-82774&quot;&gt;John Baez&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks again, Todd!  It would be really cool if the stereographic projection trick for generating new Pythagorean triples and the group structure on solutions of Pell&#039;s equations could both be seen as arising from degenerate cases of the usual group structure on elliptic curves.

If it&#039;s true, one could write a nice Whiggish history of Diophantine equations organized around the theme of &#039;group laws&#039;.  I certainly would have understood number theory a bit better if someone had told me that tale.

If you can dig up anything on group structures on degenerate cubics, I&#039;d be very interested.  I&#039;ll try to learn a bit about the history of the stereographic projection trick.

One can&#039;t help wonder what&#039;s in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diophantus#Other_works&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;lost works of Diophantus&lt;/a&gt;.   (Right now I&#039;m having a huge amount of fun reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ams.org/notices/200808/tx080800943p.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Archimedes Codex&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Reviel Netz and William Noel, so my interest in the lost history of Greek mathematics is re-energized.)

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  As for (1): you may have to help me a bit because I am not on intimate terms with the terminology.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Neither am I, which is why I put &#039;real form&#039; in quotes.  I know about real forms of complex Lie or associative algebras or (a bit more to the point) complex algebraic varieties, but clearly that idea generalizes a lot...

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  If I understand the question, it’s whether the complexified versions of the norm 1 groups are isomorphic, and the answer has to be ‘yes&#039;.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Great, that&#039;s what I figured.  I suppose to be more conservative  in this Diophantine context one might tensor with an imaginary quadratic extension of $latex \mathbb{Q}$ rather than $latex \mathbb{C}$.  For example, if you look for solutions of $latex x^2 + y^2 = 1$ in $latex \mathbb{Q}$ you&#039;ll find Pythagorean triples.   But if you adjoin $latex \sqrt{-2}$ and then look for solutions of this equation, you&#039;ll also find rational solutions of $latex x^2 - 2 y^2 = 1$.]]></description>
