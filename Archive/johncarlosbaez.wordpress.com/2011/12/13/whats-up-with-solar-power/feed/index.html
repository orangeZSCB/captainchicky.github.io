					<description><![CDATA[Frits, It occurs to me, there is a solid proof of your position, making your view that there is no reality not produced by consciousness into a tautology.

I&#039;ve only been reversing that motive, and looking for what prevents me from closing the loop of self-attribution, rather than looking for what&#039;ll persuade me it can&#039;t be opened.  There always seems to be interruptions in either.]]></description>

So, You&#039;re saying nature just needs to be considered a projection of consciousness, or &quot;epistemology&quot; at least, and that idea needs to be treated as unquestionable?   

Why isn&#039;t it a fair test to see what there is to learn from taking leads others have found to be highly useful, discovered while exploring the opposite assumption?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well, yes, I&#039;m taking the view that to make sense of the large differences between thought and natural systems, we need to consider conscious reality as a natural system of thought, within a preceding physical reality.   I don&#039;t deny that there are big problems to solve.   It&#039;s easy enough to both observe and explain why what&#039;s going on within other systems like our own minds, organized and animated from the inside, is inherently unknowable.  

That is only one if many big problems for the traditional view, that an observer can determine reality from their observations.  We demonstrably can&#039;t, but much of what we do observe originates from their hidden workings.   What&#039;s clear is that any explanation based on our observations will be leaving all that level of reality out, and makes even the most &quot;objective&quot; explanation highly subjective indeed.  So, you see I arrive at the same caution you do, but based on what&#039;s unknowable about physical phenomena.

I just think it&#039;s also highly subjective to think that natural systems don&#039;t hide anything, to the point of making it plausible that consciousness must have come first.  To me that sounds like an unsupported assumption, not a conclusion.  It&#039;s not being offered as a hypothesis, to see if it&#039;s testable.  Maybe that&#039;s what I pushed myself to do years ago, in order to come up with this line of inquiry, just conceding that *maybe* my thoughts are not making up my brain. 

In testing it you&#039;d only need to come up with an explanation for the range of quite complexly organized things that occur as physical phenomena, unavoidably independent of our reasoning.  There&#039;s the distinctive burst of neurological network activity of &quot;having a thought&quot; for example.  There&#039;s every function of our bodies, and all the other complexly self-organized systems of nature that have workings completely hidden from outside view.   It makes it seem the natural view of consciousness is of there being two realities, where different explanatory principles apply.  One is subjective consciousness, working as any person thinks, and the other is full of things working by themselves, independent of our thought.   

If not permitting the question to be tested on the evidence I think that might be considered more emotional reticence than a defense of principle.  That would seem to rely on refusing to entertain any doubt about a major proposition.   Once you do you find it&#039;s a far less costly a question to ask than it might have first seemed.  As soon as you emotionally permit it, your reasoning is them more swayed by the predominance of the evidence.  You still have the freedom to go back and forth, and for particular questions to be associated with the world view with which it belongs, at one&#039;s own pace.]]></description>

The last lines of your reply read: &quot;... you just have to allow the hypothesis that there IS a physical reality first, and one might potentially be missing information about it! etc.&quot;

From my epistemological point of view, those lines hit the nail on the head of the problem I have with your approach: me &#039;here&#039;, unknown territory to-be-milked &#039;out there.&#039; What you don&#039;t seem to get is that you&#039;re separating yourself from the reality you&#039;re part of.  Physical reality doesn&#039;t come first. What DOES comes first is that you and I co-incide with what we think we look at and try to understand. That&#039;s the only way to understand why, for example, the sky is blue. It&#039;s the interplay between sunlight &#038; oxigen &#038; us.

Your statement &quot;reality first&quot; implies the very same epistemological first step that your average scientist makes: here I am and out there is reality. It&#039;s naive.
The naivety shows in the name of your site. Have a close look at it. It&#039;s called Reading Signals from Nature. That name could well have been the motto of the oracle of Delphy in ancient Greece or of the present Wall Steet Index. Their dynamics are the same: make believe you&#039;re not part of the territory you&#039;re watching and pretend to be collecting info from &#039;out there.&#039; You @couldaknown bettter since nature turned up with Darwin and Cybernetics.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ah, well, the *way* you can know &quot;there&#039;s no way to know&quot; is by looking at the edges of the evident holes in your information.  There are lots of different kinds of observable limits to extending our information, of course.  Pushing some kinds of edges yields more than others, though.  That science took &quot;a big leap&quot; in assuming what we don&#039;t know doesn&#039;t matter is the problem.   We end up treating just whatever information we&#039;ve found how to collect as defining the universe, is the deeper problem.  It&#039;s really better to let the universe be self-defining, and our information be only what we know, right?

As the QM physicists do it, reality for science is defined as its information, and whatever analysis follows.   The question of whether any &quot;other&quot; reality is then brushed aside as not being a subject of science by semantic tautology.  That&#039;s where the Heisenberg uncertainty principle gets to be an implication that reality is uncertain, and not just our information about it, for example.  It&#039;s a wonderful fantasy that doesn&#039;t detract from the analysis of the data we have, and so is also practically meaningless in that it applies to nothing else.  

So, taking the opposite approach, there are evidently lots of different kinds of limits to our information.  Our distinct lack of information about the internal designs of the self-organizing and self-managing systems we interact with you&#039;d expect to be MUCH more consequential.   I&#039;d quite agree with you that the other approaches to systems theory have proven &quot;nice in theory&quot; often, but rather feeble in their application.  I think there&#039;s a clear material cause, that they all attempt to specify systems everyone has names for... but no one has real information about.  

To me that exposes a mismatch between the method and the subject.  You can&#039;t represent things with models unless you have information to encode first.   So, I go back to a more primitive technique.  It starts with accepting I don&#039;t have enough information to do &quot;problem solving&quot; and have to resort to a forensic use of information, for &quot;problem finding&quot; instead.

Take the example of my Systems Energy Assessment (SEA) econometric method for measuring the energy use of businesses.  It looks at businesses as a network of physical services working together, identified by being linked by *physical* causation, and finds a big &quot;hole in our information&quot; about their energy use.  We only record the energy use information for the technology being used.   None of the self-managing parts of a business report or even record how much energy they use to deliver their equally essential services.   

That leaves one to find a way to assign a more accurate estimate than zero, to the energy uses of the working parts of the business that leave no energy records.   It turns out the overlooked energy uses are nominally four times the scale of the recorded ones, and to explain a *whole lot* about why the accounting of economists is so disconnected from physical reality!  

To study that you just have to allow the hypothesis that there IS a physical reality first, and one might potentially be missing information about it!  Then you can test your ability to locate answerable questions about what might be hidden from view, and come to find some methods for doing that consistently successful.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/12/13/whats-up-with-solar-power/#comment-13432&quot;&gt;J.L. Henshaw (@shoudaknown)&lt;/a&gt;.

Assuming that you&#039;re right in concluding &quot;We don&#039;t know because there is no way to know,&quot; there seems to be no point in you trying and we&#039;d better accept the limits of knowledge.
Refusing on the other hand, to accept that there is no way to know, the only strategy is to lay one down in walking. That is, by reshuffling/combining existing theories.
- For example combining autopoiesis and Rosen&#039;s M,R approach; Googling, one sees that results are not very fruitfull: it&#039;s very abstract and experts find the maths quite right. Probably our host John Baez could help you on this one.
- A more general approach is Complexity. a guided tour, Melanie Mitchell. Oxford University Press. Oxford 2009.  Or: Unsimple truths. science, complexity, and policy, Sandra D. Mitchell. University of Chicago Press. Chicago 2009.
- In the field of economics the concept of &#039;natural experiment&#039; is being developed. Here, the guiding principle is to conceive of history as producing experiments; it is up to creative research to recognize and analyse them. See for instance Economic Gangsters - Corruption, Violence, and the Poverty of Nations, Raymond Fisman &#038; Edward Miguel. Princeton University Press. Princeton 2008.]]></description>

Refusing on the other hand, to accept that there is no way to know, the only strategy is to lay one down in walking. That is, by reshuffling/combining existing theories.<br />
&#8211; For example combining autopoiesis and Rosen&#8217;s M,R approach; Googling, one sees that results are not very fruitfull: it&#8217;s very abstract and experts find the maths quite right. Probably our host John Baez could help you on this one.<br />
&#8211; A more general approach is Complexity. a guided tour, Melanie Mitchell. Oxford University Press. Oxford 2009.  Or: Unsimple truths. science, complexity, and policy, Sandra D. Mitchell. University of Chicago Press. Chicago 2009.<br />
&#8211; In the field of economics the concept of &#8216;natural experiment&#8217; is being developed. Here, the guiding principle is to conceive of history as producing experiments; it is up to creative research to recognize and analyse them. See for instance Economic Gangsters &#8211; Corruption, Violence, and the Poverty of Nations, Raymond Fisman &amp; Edward Miguel. Princeton University Press. Princeton 2008.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[But, those are for information theory, i.e. for what is constructable from available definable observations.

I&#039;m pointing out a very large, verifiable, source of  *missing information*   How self-managing systems work (like you or me) is hidden inside their own self-referencing processes, and so not visible to the outside.  That&#039;s the usual case for the systems of nature that develop internal organization by growth.   Outside observers not &quot;in the loops&quot; of their internalized behaviors are then consequently &quot;out of the loop&quot; in terms of being able to reconstruct them from observations, being naturally quite unaware and uninformed.   

Just think about how hard it is to know what&#039;s going on in your daughter&#039;s mind, or in your competitor&#039;s research, or within another culture.   Seriously.

All an outside observer can deduce from their lack of information of what&#039;s going on inside other things is just some stereotype crafted to patch over the hole in their information about how such self-managing systems actually work.   We don&#039;t know because there is no way to know, for entirely natural causes.]]></description>
