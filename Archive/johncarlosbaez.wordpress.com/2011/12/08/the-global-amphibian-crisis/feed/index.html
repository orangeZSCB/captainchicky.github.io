					<description><![CDATA[[...] We studied the population genetics of chytridiomycosis using DNA sequences from a global panel of strains. These data showed evidence of a strong genetic bottleneck in the history of the pathogen, and the epidemic appears traceable to the widespread dispersal of a single genotype. Populations were not structured by host-origin, and the same lineage was detected in populations of both resistant and highly sensitive species.

					<description><![CDATA[One should always be careful not to introduce foreign species in the wild. From &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambusia_affinis&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt; Wikipedia &lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The majority of these introductions were ill-advised; in most countries where mosquitofish have been introduced, endemic fish species were proven to already provide maximal mosquito control, and the introduction of mosquitofish has been both unnecessary and highly damaging to endemic fish and other endemic aquatic life. In Australia, G. holbrooki has caused great damage to indigenous fish and frog species. For example, it is considered responsible for the extinction of rainbowfish in subtropical streams around Brisbane.

However, in some areas, introduction of mosquitofish did help in eradicating malaria

					<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t see anything on the frog pond website about avoiding building a mosquito pond. Apparently there are fish one should include.
