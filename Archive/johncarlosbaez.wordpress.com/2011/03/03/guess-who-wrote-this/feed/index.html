It should be blueprint but will likely go scramble as no one is willing to do scenario analysis on energy supplies. 
One aspect on projecting future pathways is having a model that can adapt quickly. As you and Peter Morgan say below, it is impossible to predict future shocks, but having something available as it happens or that can project alternative scenarios is important. That is why I have the Oil Shock Model, which is a simple Markov flow or compartmental network model with the last stage perturbed by events or disruptions.

Most of what you said is either wrong or misleading.

There is little strong evidence that the Medieval Warm Period was, globally, warmer than today.  We never &quot;switched over to satellites&quot; for temperature measurements; we still use surface stations, in addition to satellites.  The surface temperature record has used ocean temperatures for longer than 30 years.  High polar latitudes have warmed much faster than other latitudes, but the warming is not localized to Greenland, and most certainly is global.  The &lt;em&gt;global&lt;/em&gt; warming from the Last Glacial Maximum was not 16 F; that&#039;s probably a Greenland temperature (and, as you noted, Greenland warms more).  Globally it was more like 5-6 C (~9-11 F).  Probably about half of that was due to a large ice albedo feedback from continental ice sheets which are not present today.  The remaining warming is commensurate with modern estimates of the climate sensitivity to CO2.  What people care most about is not the warming that has occurred so far, but the much larger warming that will occur in the future.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The beef is in the physics.   The scientists wouldn&#039;t be talking about at all for the very reasons you site if they didn&#039;t quite clearly understand that increasingly blocking radiation in the atmosphere causes an irreversible process of heat accumulation for the planet.  

The basics also include the direct observation of outer atmosphere cooling, indicating that the earth is radiating less heat to space.  Having the outer atmosphere cooling as the troposphere is warming creates a steeper temperature gradient for convection, as a direct and unavoidable cause storms of greater number or intensity.  

Is that helpful?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;The decade 2000-2010 is the hottest ever recorded and data reveals each decade over the last 50 years to be hotter than the previous one&quot;

So what? Every decade for the last 400 years was colder than following one. We are still not as warm as we were during the Medieval Warming Period, so obviously it can&#039;t be that bad.

Besides, our records are not very accurate or consistent. Only in the last thirty years did we switch over to satellites and start including ocean temperatures. Most of the AVERAGE 1.26F rise in the last 150 years has been over Greenland. In a distant second placed are a few spots on the ocean, but it most definitely is not GLOBAL.

And remember this: CO2 levels rose from 180 to 280ppm at the end of the last glaciation. During that time temps rose a staggering 16F. CO2 levels have risen from 280 to 380 in the last 100 years, and all we have seen is a mere 1.25F rise in temp.

Where&#039;s the beef?]]></description>

Interesting!  Thanks!

I&#039;ll make this general point so that Phil Henshaw doesn&#039;t feel the need to do so yet again: projections are useful only until processes that you&#039;d neglected start becoming important.  Then they projections break down.  Or more precisely: while aspects of the old analysis remain useful, the analysis needs to be redone.   The time at which  this to occur is a random variable, and it would be awfully nice if there were a way to estimate anything about this random variable ahead of time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Shell Oil?  That newsletter was making the rounds at http://theoildrum.com. Certain oil companies are more enlightened than others. Its Royal Dutch Shell after all and they may want to get in the windmill biz.

I have used a recent Shell oil discovery data set in my work. They are a bit more optimistic than the peak oil analysts but it didn&#039;t make that much of a difference, perhaps a few years deferred. They see the writing on the wall -- I think their euphemism for depletion is &quot;planetary boundaries &quot;. My problem is why no one acted sooner in pointing out the issues.

I spent time writing up The Oil Conundrum because I saw a huge hole in the depletion analysis, which up to that point had been largely heuristics. It was nowhere near as comprehensive as climate science.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Below is from a 2008 publication from the same source. It is one scenario they see possible for the world in 2050.

&lt;blockquote&gt;National governments ... focus their energy policies on supply levers because curbing the growth of energy demand – and hence economic growth – is simply too unpopular for politicians to undertake. A lack of international cooperation means that individual countries are unwilling to act unilaterally in a way that will damage their own economic growth. The result is a relatively uncoordinated range of national mandates and incentives for developing indigenous energy supplies where available, including coal, heavy oils, biofuels, and other renewables, which leads to a patchwork of local standards and technologies.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

They believe that it is in the long term best interest of all actors (individuals, governments, businesses) to take a realistic and long term view of the energy (and ecological and economic and social and political) situation and respond in a measured and rational way. Neither shocks nor surprises are in anyone&#039;s best long term interests.]]></description>
