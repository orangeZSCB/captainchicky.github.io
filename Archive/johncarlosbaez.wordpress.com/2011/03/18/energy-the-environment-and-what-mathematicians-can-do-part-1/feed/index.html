Sorry, but your projected numbers on solar PV simply do not make sense until economic storage is developed. The sun does not shine at night at all, not much during the winter and accumulators are just too inefficient and expensive.

What we need is not PV, but molecular engines manufacturing some energy rich chemical using sunlight, not flammable, non-toxic, not explosive like e.g. sugar.

To close the cycle one also needs micron sized fuel cells in the array which turn the energy stored into electricity on demand.

There&#039;s nothing inherently impossible in such a solution, just needs advanced molecular nanotechnology with self-replicating programmable molecular assemblers to bring costs down.

The default construction material for such a large scale industrial project is carbon, extracted from airborne carbon dioxide (to avoid mining and transportation costs). The only caveat is that eventually atmospheric carbon dioxide should be replenished for as soon as it gets depleted too much, plant life suffers.

Unfortunately we do not know the time frame necessary to accomplish such a technological advance. Anyway, it makes sense to advise bright young people, mathematicians included, to go for nanotech.

However, even in this case average solar flux is pretty low which means land use can never be efficient. One can of course put surfaces like roads and rooftops to dual use, but going beyond that is plain crazy. Raw land area is one of the two resources for which expanded reproduction does not work, not even with the most advanced technology imaginable (the other one is span of human attention).

Therefore we also need to develop sustainable compact energy sources like thorium breeder reactors and need them fast.]]></description>

Thats fine. Go ahead.

John wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I made a guess that the “employment ratio” is what Wikipedia calls the “employment-to-population ratio”, and added a link to that.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ILO writes about the employment-to-population ratio:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Table 2a. Employment-to-population ratio (ILO estimates, by sex and age group)

The employment-to-population ratio is defined as the proportion of a country’s working-age population that is employed. A high ratio means that a large proportion of a country’s population is employed, while a low ratio means that a large share of the population is not involved directly in market-related activities, because they are either unemployed or (more likely) out of the labour force altogether. The ILO estimates in table 2a are harmonized to account for differences in national data collection and tabulation methodologies as well as for other country-specific factors such as military service requirements. The series includes both nationally reported and imputed data and only estimates that are national, meaning there are no geographic limitations in coverage.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I have no idea what they mean by &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The ILO estimates in table 2a are harmonized to account for differences in national data collection...&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This strange attempt in &quot;harmonizing&quot; may explain the differences between the International Labour Organisation (ILO) (compare
their KILM table at
&lt;a&gt;Employment-to-population-ratio&lt;/a&gt;) 

and the OECD data listed on the Wikipedia site.

I had asked ILO meanswhile a couple of times for formulas via email (partially sending the request to other adresses) but got only some phrases or no reply at all. I had sent them the link to the economic growth page and I had written them they should put formulas next to the tables in KILM.

In short: the ILO doesnt seem to be overly interested in my free consulting efforts, nor is their &lt;a&gt;CRM&lt;/a&gt; very attractive.

I am really fed up with spending my time (and this is my free time!) with trying to make sense of incomplete information. (see also the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Mathforge/Azimuth/comments.php?DiscussionID=600&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt; between Frederik and me about the elasticity).

So everybody please go ahead and edit this page!]]></description>

Definitely, yes!  But a native English speaker could improve your prose and make it really nice.

For example, I&#039;d say &quot;Isn&#039;t it?&quot; instead of &quot;isnt?&quot; &lt;img src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/emoticons/tongue2.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;

Whenever I read things on the Azimuth Wiki, I try to make them nicer.  Sometimes it doesn&#039;t take much more work than reading them.  Sometimes I get interested in the details and put a lot of work into it.  It depends a lot on how much time I have that day.

&lt;blockquote&gt;

I don’t know when I am going to continue writing at this article, it takes a lot of time and besides the fact that I think something like what I proposed should be done I haven’t yet developed a sufficient passion for the subject that I would like to spend too much free time on it. So it may take me another year until I write more. 

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That&#039;s okay.  Of course I want everyone (or at least everyone &lt;i&gt;smart&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;sensible&lt;/i&gt;) to join the Azimuth Project and become very passionate about it and put a lot of time into it.  But I don&#039;t think that pressuring people makes them more passionate.  So: do whatever you like!]]></description>

So, I was going to suggest that you put some of this material on the Azimuth Wiki—that will make it easy to edit. But now I see you’ve already put some on. Great!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

-Just look what you have put on!

...I made only this little page.

I don&#039;t really know where to put the other sections of the article. Like I don&#039;t think that the Azimuth project needs the overview about games. I don&#039;t know.

I regard my description of a possible game scheme in blog post &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.randform.org/blog/?p=2312&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;On the return of investments&lt;/a&gt; as a very rough outline of a so-called &quot;design treatment&quot; (see the article &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gamedev.net/index.php?app=core&#038;module=search&#038;do=search&#038;fromMainBar=1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Game Design Process&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a&gt;Francois Laramee&lt;/a&gt;). According to Laramee the next step includes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Then, you should move to a preliminary design, discussing the game&#039;s rules, content and behaviour in a purely qualitative way.  This document should be circulated and discussed as widely as possible given the situation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

so this could be something for the wiki.

Moreover the game scheme in the blog post  is just a more or less concrete suggestion and one point of the article was that there may be other schemes, that one may want to use the schemes as a research tool etc. so the proposed game scheme is rather just intended for having at least one concrete guideline (there is already enough theoretical blabla in the internet). The flexibility towards other schemes may also be interesting to discuss. 

I don&#039;t know when I am going to continue writing at this article, it takes a lot of time and besides the fact that I think something like what I proposed should be done I haven&#039;t yet developed a sufficient passion for the subject that I would like to spend too much free time on it. So it may take me another year until I write more. That depends on also on outer circumstances.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/03/18/energy-the-environment-and-what-mathematicians-can-do-part-1/#comment-4862&quot;&gt;WebHubTel&lt;/a&gt;.

Part of the background is that I come from a statistical machine learning background, so one of the things heavily imprinted on me is that one can often fit a curve from a reasonably &quot;expressive&quot; family to most data sets, but that without additional validation this can&#039;t be taken to demonstrate either level of model predicitivity or, even harder, that the model is the &quot;actual&quot; mechanism of the studied phenomenon. Techniques like threefold cross validation (or in the case of very low data volume, leave-one-out validation), where some of the data is deliberately only ever &quot;seen&quot; to score a fitted model, have been devised by the community in order to solve the real, serious problem of being able to meaningfully look at if one model is &quot;better&quot; than another (or in the extreme if a model is significantly better than expected by general &quot;pick the closest curve from this set&quot; considerations). This is a really important consideration in stat mach learning, since we&#039;ve generally decided we &lt;em&gt;don&#039;t&lt;/em&gt; understand the system enough to input/extract the &quot;true&quot; model, so unless we assess predictivity meaningfully (eg, using data unseen in the model fitting process) there&#039;s no point to what we&#039;re doing.

If one thinks that one of the goals of Azimuth is synthesising an accurate &quot;effective theory&quot;, let alone a &quot;physically correct&quot; theory (to nick a bit of physics jargon) of various environmental issues, then doing meaningful model evaluation is going to be important. And that will generally requires collecting new evaluation data, which in turn does cost money. (I&#039;m not saying that this is remotely easy: part of the reason I left my academic niche was realising that, despite large amounts of money being spent on it, the data collected in that field wasn&#039;t really capable of validating the model research I and others were doing, and that addressing that would put me in the position of trying to write grants for data collection rather than doing  model building.)]]></description>

<p>Part of the background is that I come from a statistical machine learning background, so one of the things heavily imprinted on me is that one can often fit a curve from a reasonably &#8220;expressive&#8221; family to most data sets, but that without additional validation this can&#8217;t be taken to demonstrate either level of model predicitivity or, even harder, that the model is the &#8220;actual&#8221; mechanism of the studied phenomenon. Techniques like threefold cross validation (or in the case of very low data volume, leave-one-out validation), where some of the data is deliberately only ever &#8220;seen&#8221; to score a fitted model, have been devised by the community in order to solve the real, serious problem of being able to meaningfully look at if one model is &#8220;better&#8221; than another (or in the extreme if a model is significantly better than expected by general &#8220;pick the closest curve from this set&#8221; considerations). This is a really important consideration in stat mach learning, since we&#8217;ve generally decided we <em>don&#8217;t</em> understand the system enough to input/extract the &#8220;true&#8221; model, so unless we assess predictivity meaningfully (eg, using data unseen in the model fitting process) there&#8217;s no point to what we&#8217;re doing.</p>
<p>If one thinks that one of the goals of Azimuth is synthesising an accurate &#8220;effective theory&#8221;, let alone a &#8220;physically correct&#8221; theory (to nick a bit of physics jargon) of various environmental issues, then doing meaningful model evaluation is going to be important. And that will generally requires collecting new evaluation data, which in turn does cost money. (I&#8217;m not saying that this is remotely easy: part of the reason I left my academic niche was realising that, despite large amounts of money being spent on it, the data collected in that field wasn&#8217;t really capable of validating the model research I and others were doing, and that addressing that would put me in the position of trying to write grants for data collection rather than doing  model building.)</p>

Nad&#8212;I liked the article you sent me about games, the role of labour, etcetera.  When reading it, I wanted to help polish the English spelling, grammar and style.  (My dad was an editor, so this is something I can&#039;t resist doing.)

So, I was going to suggest that you put some of this material on the Azimuth Wiki&#8212;that will make it easy to edit.   But now I see you&#039;ve &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/economic+growth+and+labour&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;already put some on&lt;/a&gt;.  Great!]]></description>

I kind of thought that this is what Azimuth is all about.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That&#039;s certainly &lt;i&gt;part&lt;/i&gt; of what it&#039;s all about.  So, I&#039;m hoping you&#039;ll use the Azimuth Wiki as a place to put some of your analyses of (for example) oil depletion.  Links to data are also much appreciated.]]></description>
