This sort of Darwinian evolution may not quickly lead to &#039;intelligence&#039; of the sort we humans pride ourselves on, but it could lead to prerequisites that are quite significant, like: the ability to distinguish between &#039;self&#039; and &#039;non-self&#039;, the ability to sense and react to a wide variety of threats, the ability to cooperate, and so on.]]></description>

Yeah, but will it stop the human operator from kill -9&#039;ing the processes? Will it negotiate? &quot;Dave, why are you doing this?&quot;]]></description>

Not only that: Nahm estimates 150 years until “we really understand what is going on at the basic scale” in physics.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Of course, that&#039;s not particularly relevant to the question of AI: we don&#039;t need to understand fundamental physics to develop AI.

But I essentially agree with Nahm.  Though I&#039;d be loath to put a date on how long it&#039;ll take to figure out the true laws of physics, there are lots of very basic important things that we&#039;re completely clueless about.  Why do elementary particles have mass at all, let alone the specific masses they have?  What is most of the universe made of?  (Not, apparently, the kinds of matter we understand.)  Why does space have 3 dimensions?  Etcetera.
