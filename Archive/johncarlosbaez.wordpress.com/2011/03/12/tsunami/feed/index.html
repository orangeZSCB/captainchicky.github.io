    Their findings are in contrast to estimates by the World Health Organization and the International Atomic Energy Agency that initially said only 31 people had died among the “liquidators,” those approximately 830,000 people who were in charge of extinguishing the fire at the Chernobyl reactor and deactivation and cleanup of the site.

The book finds that by 2005, between 112,000 and 125,000 liquidators had died.

This book appears to be the source for all claims that Chernobyl disaster caused 985,000 deaths&#8212;a &lt;b&gt;vastly&lt;/b&gt; higher figure than the UN&#039;s estimate of less than 6,000, or the World Health Organization&#039;s estimate of 400.

Yablokov was also a general editor of the 2006 Greenpeace report, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.greenpeace.to/publications/Chernobyl_Health_Report.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Chernobyl Catastrophe: Consequences on Human Health&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

					<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s a video taken by a news crew who ventured into the exclusion zone, taking radiation readings in microSieverts as they approached first the Fukushima Dai-ni plant, and then Fukushima Dai-ichi. At 1.5 km from Fukushima Dai-ichi, the reading was 110 microSieverts per hour, about 0.25 REM per day, which, although not totally safe, would not be a threat to health - 10 days, 2.5 REM, 100 days, 25 rem, one year, 87 REM assuming no drop in emissions... but it strikes me as safe enough to allow people to go back and get their farm animals and pets and their household goods.

It seems to me that the &quot;quick calculation&quot; methods we use..
&lt;blockquote&gt;A quick calculation displays that alone solar power could be enough to replace fossil and nuclear power.  see potentials of solar power at Azimuth &lt;/blockquote&gt;
...are sometimes not accompanied by a study of the environmental systems the theory is assumed to apply to. 

There was a long discussion on my calculations of the same thing, not much different except for my asking where the end of the solar potential would be.  To convert to solar, in 100 years &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.synapse9.com/design/dollarshadow.htm#s3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt; we&#039;d need to cover ~5% of the earth surface with solar panel grids&lt;/a&gt; with an area of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.synapse9.com/design/dollarshadow.htm#s5&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;6m^2 for a day for each average $1 of products &lt;/a&gt;... 

That points to problems of numerous practical and financial kinds.  What&#039;s the cost of that land?  And, would we miss having that 5% of the earth for what it now gets used for..?  Would we continue doubling that growing set-aside for energy collection every ~40 years, to have more and more energy?  Do those complications reduce the system net-energy??

One of the hidden reasons for the last question is that there&#039;s a major EROI calculation error in the current business modeling method that makes technologies that seem to deliver high net energy on paper produce far less in reality.  Only the visible and traceable energy uses are being accounted for!   The visible and traceable energy needs for business technology are often only about ~20% of the total.  The &quot;hidden&quot; energy cost of business expenses that don&#039;t leave energy use receipts is often ~80%.  So we need a better way to estimate &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.synapse9.com/pub/SEA_EROIwind.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the EROI for Whole Business Systems&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>

see &lt;a&gt;potentials of solar power at Azimuth&lt;/a&gt;

Moreover apart from aspects like power density per area aspects like carbon footprint may play also a role. See e.g. the article:

However, nuclear emits twice as much carbon as solar photovoltaic, at 32 gCO2e/kWh, and six times as much as onshore wind farms, at 10 gCO2e/kWh. &quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It strikes me as amazing that no one here has really brought up the use of thorium as fuel for nuclear reactors:

&quot;Thorium as a nuclear fuel

Thorium, as well as uranium and plutonium, can be used as fuel in a nuclear reactor. A thorium fuel cycle offers several potential advantages over a uranium fuel cycle including much greater abundance on Earth, superior physical and nuclear properties of the fuel, enhanced proliferation resistance, and reduced nuclear waste production.[14] Nobel laureate Carlo Rubbia at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research), has worked on developing the use of thorium as a cheap, clean and safe alternative to uranium in reactors. Rubbia states that a tonne of thorium can produce as much energy as 200 tonnes of uranium, or 3,500,000 tonnes of coal.[15] One of the early pioneers of the technology was U.S. physicist Alvin Weinberg at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, who helped develop a working nuclear plant using liquid fuel in the 1960s.

In 1997 the U.S. Energy Department underwrote research into thorium fuel, and research was also begun in 1996 by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), to study the use of thorium reactors. Nuclear scientist, Alvin Radkowsky, of Tel Aviv University in Israel, founded a consortium to develop thorium reactors, which included other companies: Raytheon Nuclear Inc., Brookhaven National Laboratory, and the Kurchatov Institute in Moscow.[16] Radkowsky was chief scientist in the U.S. nuclear submarine program directed by Admiral Hyman Rickover and later headed the design team which built the world&#039;s first civilian nuclear power plant at Shippingport, Pennsylvania, which was a scaled-up version of the first naval reactor.[16]

Some countries, including India, are now investing in research to build thorium-based nuclear reactors. Anil Kakodkar, chairman of the Indian Atomic Energy Commission, said in 2009 that his country has a &quot;long-term objective goal of becoming energy-independent based on its vast thorium resources.&quot;[17][18] In May 2010, researchers from Ben-Gurion University in Israel and Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York, received a grant to develop a thorium-based, self-sustaining light water reactor[19] that will produce and consume about the same amounts of fuel.[19] In the U.S., NASA scientist and thorium expert Kirk Sorensen calls it the &quot;next giant leap&quot; in energy technology, noting that the &quot;potential energy in thorium is staggering,&quot; explaining how just 8 tablespoons of thorium could provide the energy used by an American during his or her lifetime.[20][21]&quot;

Perhaps John could do an interview with Kirk Sorensen and open a new topic on thorium as nuclear fuel - granted, it&#039;s outside of mathematics, but still it ought to be discussed...]]></description>

<p>It strikes me as amazing that no one here has really brought up the use of thorium as fuel for nuclear reactors:</p>
<p>&#8220;Thorium as a nuclear fuel</p>
<p>Thorium, as well as uranium and plutonium, can be used as fuel in a nuclear reactor. A thorium fuel cycle offers several potential advantages over a uranium fuel cycle including much greater abundance on Earth, superior physical and nuclear properties of the fuel, enhanced proliferation resistance, and reduced nuclear waste production.[14] Nobel laureate Carlo Rubbia at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research), has worked on developing the use of thorium as a cheap, clean and safe alternative to uranium in reactors. Rubbia states that a tonne of thorium can produce as much energy as 200 tonnes of uranium, or 3,500,000 tonnes of coal.[15] One of the early pioneers of the technology was U.S. physicist Alvin Weinberg at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, who helped develop a working nuclear plant using liquid fuel in the 1960s.</p>
<p>In 1997 the U.S. Energy Department underwrote research into thorium fuel, and research was also begun in 1996 by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), to study the use of thorium reactors. Nuclear scientist, Alvin Radkowsky, of Tel Aviv University in Israel, founded a consortium to develop thorium reactors, which included other companies: Raytheon Nuclear Inc., Brookhaven National Laboratory, and the Kurchatov Institute in Moscow.[16] Radkowsky was chief scientist in the U.S. nuclear submarine program directed by Admiral Hyman Rickover and later headed the design team which built the world&#8217;s first civilian nuclear power plant at Shippingport, Pennsylvania, which was a scaled-up version of the first naval reactor.[16]</p>

You don&#039;t need to use wood for heating air or water, you can use passive solar and passive solar water heating; see http://www.builditsolar.com/Projects/SpaceHeating/SolarShed/solarshed.htm - a guy in Montana uses this set-up to heat his 2300 sq ft house to 80degF in winter; and see http://www.builditsolar.com/ in general]]></description>
