					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/03/20/mathematics-of-planet-earth/#comment-7035&quot;&gt;Florifulgurator&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi Flori,

I wrote the blurb from which the document on the CRM website was extracted.  Unfortunately, it&#039;s been removed from its context in such a way that the references aren&#039;t present.  Fortunately, John has sent me to the rescue.

Jost is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.loujost.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Lou Jost&lt;/a&gt;, an ex-physicist turned ecologist who, as far as I can tell, spends his days valiantly protecting the biodiversity of the flora and fauna of Ecuador, and his nights writing penetrating theoretical papers on the measurement of biodiversity.  The papers cited are:



Lou Jost, Entropy and diversity.  &lt;i&gt;Oikos&lt;/i&gt; 113 (2006), 363-375.


Lou Jost, Partitioning diversity into independent alpha and beta components.  &lt;i&gt;Ecology&lt;/i&gt; 88 (2007), 2427-2439.


Lou Jost, Mismeasuring biological diversity: response to Hoffmann and Hoffmann.  &lt;i&gt;Ecological Economics&lt;/i&gt; 68 (2008), 925-928.



Let me know if you want any more information.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Centre de Recerca Matemàtica (or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.crm.cat/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;CRM&lt;/a&gt;) in Barcelona is a place that hosts mathematicians for conferences and also longer-term programs.  I was there a few years a few years ago for a program on homotopy theory and higher categories.  It&#039;s a good place, though far from the beautiful downtown.

Now CRM is a partner of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mpe2013.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Mathematics of Planet Earth 2013&lt;/a&gt;, and they&#039;re encouraging applications to organize activities around this theme!  Applicants should follow the procedures explained &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.crm.cat/eng/activityapplications.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

If any mathematicians, biologists, climate scientists, or people working on sustainability are interested in talking about this, please drop me a line, either here or by email!  I can imagine wanting to help write an application.

On a separate but related note: I&#039;ve been invited to a CRM program on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.crm.es/Activitats/Activitats/2011-2012/Mathbio/The%20Mathematics%20of%20Biodiversityabstract.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Mathematics of Biodiversity&lt;/a&gt; from 18 June to July 20, 2012.  It&#039;s being organized by Ben Allen (Harvard University), Sılvia Cuadrado (Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona), Tom Leinster (coordinator, University of Glasgow), Richard Reeve (University of Glasgow) and John Woolliams (University of Edinburgh).   I&#039;m not sure I can stay there the whole time, but I&#039;ll try to stay as long as I can.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&#039;Never having fully grown up&#039; may be a pre-requisite for continuing to innovative mathematical research, even if it is antithetical to running an institution.  I certainly agree with nad: the n-category cafe/nlab is certainly the germ of a new kind of mathematical research institution (even if it isn&#039;t quite recognised as such by &#039;the establishment&#039; yet).  azimuth/the azimuth project is clearly intended to become another example of the same kind of research institution (although, to your surprise, it may be researching a subject other than mathematics. Furthermore, there is still a long way to go.)]]></description>
