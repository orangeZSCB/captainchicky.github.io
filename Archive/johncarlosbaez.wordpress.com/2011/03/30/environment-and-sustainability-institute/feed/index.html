Flori, George&#039;s comment on the stark insufficiency of renewable energy resources for BAU economics is spot on.  Your comment is too, on how finance is doomed by its need for endless growth to remain stable, but you don&#039;t seem to be making the next leap.  People use money to convey requests for energy use.  That&#039;s what connects the $ system and the energy systems.  When you study it you find the true scale of energy consumption the use of money makes requests for business to perform, the total energy demand of money, is actually about 500% larger than what even the most persistent and skillful efforts to trace business energy uses can trace... (for natural causes)!! 

Seeing that our information &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.synapse9.com/pub/SEA&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;models are missing the great majority of the energy information they need&lt;/a&gt; is a very curious &quot;little discrepancy&quot;.  I think it points toward the deeper problem that may have alternate solutions than presently being attempted.]]></description>

Well yes, food comes from the global markets, and starvation, or &quot;malnutrition&quot;, comes from the price.  

The fact that the prices are going to keep going up for very natural causes, due to &lt;a href=&quot;http://synapse9.com/blog/2011/04/30/big-news-from-henshaw-grantham-the-earth/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;prices switching from reflecting cost to reflecting scarcity&lt;/a&gt; (contrary to economic theory) is the source of the problem.  Why it is not causing &quot;starvation&quot; is because of world food aid.  Virtually no on is allowed to starve.

What the continuing price escalation of food and fuel resources worldwide is actually doing to people is knocking them out of self-sufficiency into subsistence living, dependent on foreign food aid.  The world&#039;s &quot;disaster relief&quot; programs are blindly caught in the cross fire, unfortunately.  They&#039;re almost silent about it too, as if quite unaware that having an ever growing population of people turned into refugees in their own lands, is NOT A GOOD THING to maintain.  They don&#039;t seem to realize that they should be complaining much louder about what a disaster it is.]]></description>

I should have typed malnutrition instead of starvation. Malnutrition can have irreparable effects on physical and mental development of children, without being lethal.

Malnutrition is a chronic problem in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wfp.org/countries/Pakistan/Overview&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wfp.org/content/qa-north-korea-really-hungry&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;. The mega flood/drought 2009/2010 in Pakistan sure has exacerbated things, and it won&#039;t be the last climate catastrophe to hit there. Recently the North Korean dictator has called for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2011/05/113_86576.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;more&lt;/a&gt; socialist fertilizer production...

How long can nations being proud of their A-bombs afford a hungry population? Why don&#039;t their technologists produce &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soylent_Green&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;soylent green&lt;/a&gt;?

Another problem I see with high tech dreams is the energy-economics conundrum (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EROEI&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;EROEI&lt;/a&gt; etc.). Like any ecosystem, the economy needs free energy to thrive. But these times are gone. (The financial system even needs exponential economic growth. Thus it is doomed.)

On &quot;alternative, green, and supposedly renewable (sustainable) energy sources replacing fossil fuels&quot;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://questioneverything.typepad.com/question_everything/2011/05/two-scenarios.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;George Mobus&lt;/a&gt; writes in a recent blog post:&lt;blockquote&gt;Unless you bring evidence (not hypotheticals) of scaling ability, collection and conversion efficiencies, and how the built infrastructure can be evolved quickly enough to use the electricity, I will rest with the evidence and physics that scream loudly that they will not provide even one tenth of BAU-OECD-level lifestyles let alone provide a soft landing pathway to sustainability. So what we are left with is the rapid loss of high-power energy to do economic work, to build real (useful) assets and provide sufficient food, in the foreseeable future.&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

This is exactly what I want to see here: friendly and intelligent discussion between people holding wildly divergent views of the future, from transhumanist to &#039;back to nature&#039;.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I tend to agree with this.  The world is big enough that it can get quite bad in places while still having patches where technology continues to advance.  


The world is very heterogeneous.  In Cambodia I saw beggars blind from malaria, fishing villages with houses on stilts, but also kids glued to their cell phones just like in Singapore.  If the future is like the present, we should expect all sorts of different scenarios from the utopian to the dystopian to be happening simultaneously, often in the same town.

My friend Bruce Smith jokes that many science fiction novels portray a future where&#8212;unmentioned by the author&#8212;there has been a disaster called The Great Simplification, which made the world much less complex than it is today.  Of course the author&#039;s lack of imagination is really what&#039;s to blame.]]></description>

Argument by anecdote is perilous. First I found the CEO of a Pakistani NGO denying that post-flood famine was like Africa: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pkarticleshub.com/2011/02/09/no-famine-in-floods-hit-pakistan-experts/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&quot;can UNICEF or any other organization show one incident whereby an adult or a kid has died of starvation in any part of Pakistan?&quot;&lt;/a&gt; 

This led me to wonder how bad famine is in &lt;i&gt;Africa&lt;/i&gt; today. Last year The Independent reported that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/millions-face-starvation-as-niger-prays-in-vain-for-rain-2022190.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&quot;millions face starvation&quot;&lt;/a&gt;. One year later, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Sahel_famine&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;what does Wikipedia say?&lt;/a&gt; &quot;Fatalities: 9 confirmed, 42 indirectly, 20 unconfirmed&quot;. But it does add &quot;17,800,000 were in immediate risk of starvation&quot;. 

As for North Korea, the numerous stories reporting the trade in human excrement all trace back to a seminar by a South Korean political scientist (Kim Young-soo), describing the latest news from defectors. At the same seminar he reported that &quot;skinny jeans&quot;, instant noodles, and adult movies are also in demand. Apparently Famine is the only one of the old four horsemen of the apocalypse still in operation, the other three having been replaced by 1950s Fashion, Takeaway Food, and Porn. 

I apologize for the sarcasm. I do not advance a cornucopian denial that the world has its problems. But I stand by my original assessment: the idea that our 21st-century time of troubles is going to stop technology is completely wrong. However bad it gets, over however much of the world, the troubles will coexist with a continued march towards the revolutionary capabilities that have &quot;Alpha Omega&quot; so excited.]]></description>

Where does your food come from? 

Pakistan and North Korea are excellent examples for pondering that question. Pakistan: After the super flood that came after the super drought there&#039;s now famine of African proportions. North Korea: The latest business there are shops that sell human excrement as fertilizer, for artificial and mined fertilizer is scarce.

World hunger is rising (&#062;1 billion). Food prices are rising (you don&#039;t notice yet, but the Egyptians did). That will continue and accelerate.]]></description>

Germany is an old industrialized country and serves as an example how China could evolve, or should not evolve, and for what reasons. My main point of my previous post was that urbanization is not a side effect of industrialization, it is a trend that continues through the next stage - whatever that is called (globalization?).

The point that &quot;we cannot produce a car for every Chinese citizen without a fast irriversible depletion of natural resources&quot; is a strong selling point for research in sustainability. I think the Chinese will figure this out by themselves and not follow us (Europe and especially the USA) in our path, but it would seem that some people would like countries like Germany to serve as a positive example instead of a negative one and act now. We&#039;ll see.

&lt;blockquote&gt;

I think that the increased fondness for ‘organic’ foods (as opposed to inorganic ones like titanium phosphate) and the ‘locavore’ movement are having a significant impact on American food-buying behavior and farming practices. I imagine something similar but perhaps even stronger must be going on in Germany.

Ross&#039;s article is USA-centric, the situation is very different in Germany, most farms, for example, are small family farms, there are almost no big industrialized farming companies, unlike in the USA. The topics of &quot;green food&quot; are almost 40 years old over here, and most of what Ross wrote does not apply either (I don&#039;t know if anything applies to the USA, but certainly not to Germany).

Fun fact: A delicious little kind of shrimp lives in the North see, you can by bunches of it from the fishermen. But it is hard work to peel these things, so they get transportet to Marrokko, are peeled over there and get transported back to the coast of the North sea. So if you buy &quot;fresh peeled shrimp&quot; from a north sea fisherman, the shrimp has actually travelled several thousand kilometers by ship and truck and is ca. 2 days old.

Yeah: free markets and their efficiency :-)

That&#039;s what &quot;buy local&quot; is all about over here: To stop madness like that.]]></description>

<p>Germany is an old industrialized country and serves as an example how China could evolve, or should not evolve, and for what reasons. My main point of my previous post was that urbanization is not a side effect of industrialization, it is a trend that continues through the next stage &#8211; whatever that is called (globalization?).</p>
<p>The point that &#8220;we cannot produce a car for every Chinese citizen without a fast irriversible depletion of natural resources&#8221; is a strong selling point for research in sustainability. I think the Chinese will figure this out by themselves and not follow us (Europe and especially the USA) in our path, but it would seem that some people would like countries like Germany to serve as a positive example instead of a negative one and act now. We&#8217;ll see.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think that the increased fondness for ‘organic’ foods (as opposed to inorganic ones like titanium phosphate) and the ‘locavore’ movement are having a significant impact on American food-buying behavior and farming practices. I imagine something similar but perhaps even stronger must be going on in Germany.</p>

&quot;It seems very likely that the rapid course of climate disruption (exacerbated by resource depletion, falling EROEI, overpopulation, etc.) will obsolete transhumanism as another 20th century pipe dream.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Profoundly wrong - especially the part about Earth changes as a cause of human *extinction*. You know, billions of people can die and it&#039;s still not extinction - not that I think we will get anywhere near such death tolls from climate change. 

Do you really think that under such trying circumstances, the almost 200 sovereign states of our world are all going to abandon their military technologies, satellites, communication grids, scientific and industrial centers, agricultural and biotechnological expertise, high-tech medicine, ad infinitum? Maybe you should study life in countries like North Korea or Pakistan, where existence can be incredibly tough, but they still have their nuclear deterrent and many other rudiments of modernity. Life getting harder in developed countries doesn&#039;t mean a uniform decline into preindustrial conditions; it means that they come more to resemble &quot;emerging&quot; and &quot;developing&quot; countries in which islands of high technology exist amid favelas and disaster areas. 

How much of a role transhumanist hopes, and the very word &quot;transhumanism&quot;, will play in near-future culture is an open question. But the accumulation of knowledge and technical capability is not going to stop. It should be obvious that we are still at the very beginning of discovering what biotechnology and electronic implants can do to a human being, and that this is not going to be slowed down one iota by the drumbeat of unnatural disasters around the world. On the contrary, post-disaster environments will offer a great playground for all sorts of experiments, for the same reason that high-tech militaries like to experiment with performance enhancement on the battlefield. That is not exactly transhumanism as classically conceived, but it does mean that the changing Earth will not conveniently rid us of the specter of the posthuman.]]></description>
