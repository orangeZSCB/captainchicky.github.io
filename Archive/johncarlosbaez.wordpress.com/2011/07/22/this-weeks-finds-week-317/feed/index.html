This is a hard problem.  Paleoclimate analyses often assume that there are no systematic changes in how biological proxies respond to temperature due to evolution.  This isn&#039;t because such changes are logically impossible, but simply because we don&#039;t have much evidence to tell us how they could change.

There are a few things that can be done.  It is known that biological temperature proxies can have species-dependent &quot;vital effects&quot;.  It stands to reason that the evolution of species can effect their response to temperature.

It may be possible to bound this effect:  we can look at the variation of vital effects &lt;em&gt;between&lt;/em&gt; modern species, and assume that the variation of vital effects &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; a species over time is smaller than this (on the grounds that if the time variation is large, it may have become a new species by now).

Under this assumption, it&#039;s possible to use temperature proxies of species that were extant in the past and are still extant today.  It&#039;s still possible (in fact, certain) for evolution to have occurred between the ancient and modern populations of the species, but maybe the effect isn&#039;t as large as the between-species variation.

Another approach is to try to use proxies where vital effects (at least in modern species) aren&#039;t as significant, so they&#039;re more &quot;pure&quot; indicators of environmental conditions.

This can be extended to use multiple types of proxies, on the grounds that if there were systematic evolutionary variations, they wouldn&#039;t be expected to affect all proxies in the same way.

I suppose you might also get into the evolutionary genetics of the problem, rebuilding phylogenetic trees and inferring genomic change, to see if the ancient species were likely to have had different genes affecting whatever controls the temperature proxy (e.g., the biological fractionation process).  I don&#039;t think anybody has done this, to my knowledge.

None of these assumptions are airtight, but there are at least a few basic consistency checks, and I think people will continue to make the &quot;no significant evolutionary change&quot; assumption unless there&#039;s evidence for really wide interspecies or multiproxy divergences.]]></description>

I&#039;m sure there is math that would help, and I&#039;m sure that it could be substantially automated with sufficient work.  As I mentioned above, a Gaussian approach process might work, and so could the HMM approach you suggest.

(On the other hand, my experience with applied statistics is that there is still usually a need for exploratory analysis with human input before turning the algorithm loose on data ... I&#039;m not entirely in the &quot;black-box machine learning&quot; camp.)

&quot;In short, mathematics is about turning art into algorithms.&quot;  I often say statistics is about quantifying your intuition ... expressing mathematically how sure you are about whatever process generated your data.]]></description>

The question is if there is any math that could help here - pattern matching for this kind of time series would certainly be done using hidden Markov models, like in speech recognition. Speech recognition seems to have a lot in common with cyclostratigraphy. 

Mathematics is about careful explanations of how geniuses achieve success, why it works and why you don&#039;t have to be a genius yourself to apply their wisdom. In short, mathematics is about turning art into algorithms.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There are other temperature proxies besides oxygen-18.  One I frequently see for deep sea ocean cores (tens of millions of years ago) is magnesium/calcium (Mg/Ca) ratios in foraminifera.  The absorption of these elements by plankton into their shells depends on the temperature of seawater in which they reside.  I&#039;m not too finely versed on the pros and cons of different proxies, but I know that oxygen-18&#039;s temperature response can get confounded with ice volume and ocean salinity changes.  I sometimes also see TEX86, a biological temperature proxy.  These proxies are not as commonly available as oxygen isotopes, however.  They have their own confounders, but the hope is that you can try to control for them indirectly by using multiple proxies.

In radiocarbon dating the procedure of correlating &quot;wiggles&quot; in 14C age and calendar age is actually called &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiggle_matching&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&quot;wiggle matching&quot;&lt;/a&gt; in the literature.  I think the term may generalize to matching proxy data to orbital cycles (part of the field of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclostratigraphy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;cyclostratigraphy&lt;/a&gt;).  There appears to be a bit of an art to it - I&#039;m not sure if fully automated algorithms are in use.

I&#039;ve been interested in how to do this as well, but I&#039;ve never found the time to get into it.  I might be tempted to infer a functional mapping using a slowly-varying Gaussian process prior on the reparameterization.  I think that&#039;s how Caitlin Buck does it for radiocarbon dating.]]></description>
