Shocking? But is it shocking enough as teachable moment for the U.S.?

Yeah, it&#039;s impressive - but standard business around the planet for some years meanwhile. E.g. the U.S. hasn&#039;t yet had the really ugly forest fires like Russia or Australia. Or super floods like Pakistan or Australia. Hey, Australia seems already have learnt a little?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[On &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wunderground.com/blog/RickyRood/comment.html?entrynum=200&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Weather Underground&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at U. Michigan named Ricky Rood is writing a series of articles about the heat wave in the US and climate change.  As David Corfield suggested, &quot;persistence&quot; of high pressure systems is important.  And Rood says it&#039;s more likely with high sea surface temperatures.

Rood writes:  

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wunderground.com/blog/RickyRood/comment.html?entrynum=199&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;last article&lt;/a&gt; I wrote that the extreme events of 2011 were providing us with the opportunity to think about climate and how to cope with a warming world. The U.S. is experiencing an extreme heat event this week (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=1850&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Masters @ WU&lt;/a&gt;). This heat wave is the consequence of a strong, stationary high pressure system over the central U.S., and it will move to the east over the next few days. Back on July 14th &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/post/massive-heat-wave-eyes-midwest-east-coast/2011/07/14/gIQA1YLUEI_blog.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Capital Weather Gang&lt;/a&gt; did a nice write up on the forecast of the heat wave. At the end of this blog are links to my previous blogs on heat waves and human health. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When thinking about weather, climate, and extreme events an important idea is “persistence.” For example, a heat wave occurs when there are persistent high temperatures. Persistent weather patterns occur when high and low pressure systems get large and stuck; that is, they don’t move. In the Figure below, you need to imagine North America and the United States. There is a high pressure center over the proverbial Heartland. With blue arrows I have drawn the flow of air around the high pressure system, and in this case moist air. There is moisture coming from the Gulf of Mexico and, in fact on the date when this was drawn, from the Pacific. This is common in the summer to see both the Gulf of Mexico and Pacific as sources of continental moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://climateknowledge.org/figures/WuGblog_figures/RBRWuG0193_High_Pressure_Heat.gif&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Figure 1: Schematic of a high pressure system over the central United States in July. While generic, this is drawn to represent some of the specifics of 2011. The green-shaded area is where there have been floods in 2011. The brown-shaded area represents sustained drought in the southern part of the nation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&#160;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the center of this high pressure system there is a suppression of rain, because the air is moving downward. This sets up a situation where the surface heats from the Sun’s energy. There is not much mixing and cooling, because of the suppression of the upward motion that produces rain. Hence, if this high pressure system gets stuck, then there is persistent heat. This is a classic summer heat wave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let’s think about it some more. There is lot of moisture being drawn around the edge of the high pressure system, and this moisture contributes to the discomfort of people. People – just a short aside about people: if we think about heat and health, then we are concerned about people’s ability to cool themselves. It is more difficult to cool people when it is humid because sweat does not evaporate. Suppose that in addition to this moisture, there is a region where the ground is soaked with water from flooding. Then on top of already moist air coming from the Gulf, there is local evaporation into the air being warmed by the Sun. If on the interior of the high, where the rain is suppressed, there is hot, wet air, then it becomes dangerous heat. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s not easy to derive a number that describes dangerous heat. But in much of the eastern U.S. a number that somehow combines temperature and humidity is useful. Meteorologists often use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weather.gov/om/heat/index.shtml#heatindex&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt; heat index&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the summer time version of “it’s 98 degrees, but it feels like 105.” For moist climates, the heat index is one version of the “it feels like” temperature. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/article.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Jeff Masters&lt;/a&gt; tells me that in Newton, Iowa yesterday, July 17, 2011, the heat index was 126 degrees F. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grandforksherald.com/event/article/id/210212/group/homepage/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;see here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=1850&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;131 F in Knoxville, Iowa on July 18&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another measure of heat and humidity is the dew point; that is, the temperature at which dew forms, and effectively limits the nighttime low. The dew points in Iowa, South Dakota, Minnesota, and Wisconsin are currently very high and setting records. Here is a map of dew point for July 19, 2011. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;http://climateknowledge.org/figures/WuGblog_figures/RBRWuG0193_Dew_Point_20110719.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Figure 2: Exceptionally high dew points centered on Iowa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&#160;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if I were a public health official, and I was trying to understand how a warming planet might impact my life, then here is how I would think about it. First, the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific are going to be warmer, and hence, there will be more humid air. This will mean, with regard to human health for the central U.S., heat waves will become more dangerous, without necessarily becoming hotter. It is also reasonable to expect heat waves will become more frequent and last longer, because those persistent, stuck high pressure systems are, in part, forced by the higher sea surface temperatures. If I am a public health official here is my algorithm – heat waves are already important to my life, and they are likely to get more dangerous, more frequent, and of longer duration. But by how much? Do I need to know by how much before I decide on a plan for action?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I think about the air being more humid, then I might expect to see trends in the heat index. I might expect to see trends in dew points, and trends in the nighttime minimum temperatures getting higher. (That’s where a greenhouse effect really matters.) I worry about persistent heat, warm nights, and the inability of people and buildings to cool themselves. I worry about their being dangerous heat in places where people and emergency rooms are not used to dangerous heat – not acclimated to heat – not looking for heat-related illness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let’s go back to the figure. Rain is suppressed in the middle of the high pressure system, but around the edge of the high pressure system it will rain; there will be storms. (see Figure 3 at the end) The air around the edge of high is warm and very wet. Wet air is energetic air, and it is reasonable to expect local severe storms. (See &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/19/sports/two-die-after-boat-capsizes.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Severe Storm on Lake Michigan&lt;/a&gt;) And if the high pressure is persistent, stuck, then days of extreme weather are possible. If this pattern sets up, then there is increased likelihood of flooding. If I am that public health official, then I am alerted to the possibility of more extreme weather and the dangers thereof. But, again, can the increase of extreme weather be quantified? Do I need to quantify it before I decide on a plan of action? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still with the figure - what about that region of extended drought and the heat from the high pressure system? Dehydration becomes a more important issue. As a public health official, I start to see the relation of the heat event to other aspects of the weather, the climate. I see the relation to drought. I see the flood, and it’s relation to the winter snow pack and spring rains. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what I have presented here is to look at the local mechanisms of the weather – what are the basic underlying physics responsible for hot and cold, wet and dry – for moist air? If I stick to the basic physics, and let the climate model frame the more complex regional and global picture, what can I say about the future? Do I have to have a formal prediction to take action? Here in 2011, I see drought and flood and hot weather and warm oceans that interact together to make a period of sustained, dangerous heat. It does not have to “set a record” to convey the reality of the warming earth. It tells me the type of event that is likely to come more often, of longer duration, and of, perhaps, of greater intensity. If I am a public health planner, then I can know this with some certainty. The question becomes, how do I use that information in my planning?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://climateknowledge.org:16080/figures/WuGblog_figures/RBRWuG0193_Radar_Loop_20110719.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Figure 3: Radar loop showing precipitation around the edge of the large high pressure system in the middle of the continent.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/blog/RickyRood/comment.html?entrynum=200" rel="nofollow">Weather Underground</a>, a professor at U. Michigan named Ricky Rood is writing a series of articles about the heat wave in the US and climate change.  As David Corfield suggested, &#8220;persistence&#8221; of high pressure systems is important.  And Rood says it&#8217;s more likely with high sea surface temperatures.</p>

The U.S. is experiencing an extreme heat event this week (<a href="http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=1850" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Masters @ WU</a>). This heat wave is the consequence of a strong, stationary high pressure system over the central U.S., and it will move to the east over the next few days.

Interesting. I know a bit more about how to find data on temperature, rainfall etc. than how to find data on deaths due to heat.  

I imagine there&#039;s quite a bit of room for different definitions of &#039;heat related deaths&#039;.  In a different direction, I&#039;ve heard that heavy snowfalls in the US cause a lot of heart attacks among people shovelling their driveways.  If you die that way, is it a &#039;cold-related death&#039;?  Similarly, deaths in the US due to traffic accidents after rainstorms greatly exceed deaths more directly caused by hurricanes and tornadoes.]]></description>

How do you count these events? Does the recent Japanese earthquake count as 1? Is a large aftershock part of the same event? Is a single tornado an event or is it part of a storm? How many events make up recent Mississippi flooding?

I still think you&#039;d be better off analysing metereological data than insurance data. When people have to find new building plots in crowded places they end up putting up houses in daft places. In the UK we have new housing which insurers won&#039;t touch. There are also subtle shifts in farming practices over the years, loss of marshland, failure to clear ditches, livestock compacting the soil, which can affect local flooding. Then there are shifts in river dredging practices, not always helpful flood &#039;defences&#039;, etc. If you want to know about climate change, why not use meteorological instruments?]]></description>

You scared me for a second there, since I read incoming comments in my email, so I saw yours without that map in front of me.

Just in case anyone else is similarly scared: the AIDS map doesn&#039;t show AIDS cases per square kilometer (which would be idiotic, and obviously correlated with population density), but the fraction of people who have AIDS.  So, Blake is suggesting that the chance of a person having AIDS is positively correlated to the population density... which makes some sense, since you have to actually meet someone to get AIDS.

It would be very interesting to see how much of the variations in AIDS infection can be explained by this simple fact.  Unsurprisingly, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bet.com/news/health/2011/07/14/hiv-aids-poverty-link-strongest-in-the-south-.html?ftcnt=HP_News&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the conclusions that made the news&lt;/a&gt; are more politically charged:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A reort conducted by USA Today found that nearly all U.S. counties that have high rates of HIV/AIDS cases are south of the Mason-Dixon line. The newspaper used data that was collected by Emory&#039;s Rollins School of Public Health that produced AIDSVu, the first effort to use state-of-the-art methods to map HIV infection rates by county.

Reporters Steve Sternberg and Jack Gillum wrote that the epidemic, while still prevalent in  big cities on the East and West coasts, is &quot;becoming heavily entrenched among Black men and women in pockets of poverty in 11 Southern states.&quot; 

Harold Henderson, an HIV expert at the University of Mississippi, says Southern states suffer from a host of health issues, including HIV, for reasons that extend from poverty to a lack of education and fragile families. He added that many children in the South lack sufficient sex education.

&quot;The age when kids first become sexually active is pretty young in the Deep South,&quot; he says. &quot;That has a lot to do with the fact parents don&#039;t do a good job of [educating their kids about sex]. And if you happen to live in a broken home, with drug use and poverty involved, you may not be getting the parental supervision you need.&quot;

The new analysis identified 175 counties that rank among the top 20 percent for both HIV and poverty, all but six in the South. Two of the six are the boroughs of Brooklyn and the Bronx in New York City. Seven states — Alaska, Idaho, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, Vermont and West Virginia — did not share their county-level data.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By the way, for non-English speakers out there: I would never say &#039;conduct a report&#039;.  You can conduct a study and then write a report.  (Sorry, I&#039;m an editor&#039;s son.)]]></description>

I don&#039;t know, but there&#039;s some correlation with the prevalence of AIDS.  Here&#039;s the heat map:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nnvl.noaa.gov/MediaDetail.php?MediaID=775&#038;MediaTypeID=1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;http://www.nnvl.noaa.gov/images/low_resolution/775_20110712_US_Heatwave.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
and here&#039;s a newly released interactive map showing the number of people living with a diagnosis of AIDS in 2008:
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
