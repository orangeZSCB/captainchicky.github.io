					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/07/13/australian-carbon-tax/#comment-6944&quot;&gt;Peter de Lacey (Australia)&lt;/a&gt;.

The tax that no one pays works by making carbon-intensive products more expensive and competing greener products less so. Consumers have the option of taking the more expensive product, or the relatively less expensive product and saving the extra money they get paid out by the tax.

It&#039;s not meant to be a revenue gathering exercise...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A good guide to what the Australian tax and other measures will achieve is what the voters might want it to achieve. Human cooperation is driven by our dislike of non-cooperators and our fear of being perceived as a non-cooperator. True to form, Australians are not so much interested in being good guys, as in not being seen as bad guys. We really hate being one of the world&#039;s worst per-capita emitters. This feeling also applies to people who don&#039;t themselves believe in AGW. If we believe that others believe it, then we are nervous about the fact that they think we are bad guys. So, in so far as the tax addresses AGW, it is intended as a statement to the world &quot;Look we&#039;re doing our best&quot;. However &quot;seeming to do something&quot; seems to be only a part of the aim. The left wing government has grabbed at the opportunity to tax the rich and give to the poor. They&#039;re gambling that voters will overcome their dislike of any new tax, and perceive some benefit. We&#039;ll see.

To overcome the energy crisis and/or reduce CO2 emissions we need to change infrastructure. It can&#039;t be done painlessly, as this tax claims to do. The trick is to soak up liquidity by issuing &quot;Energy Crisis&quot; bonds which will turn back into money as the crisis is overcome. We can&#039;t know if we will come out of the crisis richer or poorer. But in fact people don&#039;t care much about that. People care mostly about relative wealth. So the bonds should be guaranteed to preserve their value as a fraction of GDP (or similar). Note that we soak up liquidity so that we can reduce consumer spending and increase spending on the required new infrastructure without changing total employment.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;NOT TRUE. I and my wife will receive less compensation than a couple a few years younger would do. I donâ€™t know why.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The reason you &quot;don&#039;t know why&quot; is because it&#039;s not the case.  Aged pensioners and some self-funded retirees will get extra compensation by virtue of that status; there is no other age dependence.  I don&#039;t know if there&#039;s a bug in the estimator, but if you look at the actual changes to income tax scales and to pensions, there is no possibility of anyone getting less compensation solely because they&#039;re older.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Americans, get your own back yard in order before pontificating about Australia, please.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As it happens I&#039;m Australian myself, but that&#039;s beside the point.  I think there are plenty of things that could be improved in this scheme, but I think you&#039;re overstating the pitfalls of compensating low income earners.  That people on low incomes &lt;i&gt;with average power use&lt;/i&gt; have ended up no worse off does not shield them from the now-10%-greater cost if they increase their power use, nor render them oblivious to the now-10%-greater benefits if they can find ways to decrease their use.

That households who earn the same total income as you do through two people working, rather than just one, will benefit more from the income tax changes might be unfair, but it&#039;s hardly going to undermine the whole scheme.

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have installed solar electric panels on my roof, I have energy-efficient devices where possible, and Iâ€™m getting taxed while those who havenâ€™t bothered will be compensated.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Actually you&#039;re paying a lower electricity bill because of these choices, so the 10% increase passed on by the utilities will have less impact on you than it will on people who didn&#039;t take these measures.  The estimator page is too simplistic to ask questions about this kind of thing and take it into account, but presumably  you have some idea yourself about the difference this has made in your use of electricity from the grid.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/07/13/australian-carbon-tax/#comment-6967&quot;&gt;Peter de Lacey (Australia)&lt;/a&gt;.

Greg lives in Australia.  I live in Singapore now, but will return to California in a year.  I don&#039;t think either of us are &quot;pontificating&quot;.  If you want, I can pontificate a bit: you&#039;ll instantly notice the difference.

I very much want the United States to adopt a carbon tax, or at least a cap-and-trade system &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/12/20/carbon-trading-in-california/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;like California already has&lt;/a&gt;.  Right now this seems unlikely: indeed, it seems more likely that the whole country will go into default next week.   But I believe that eventually the US will adopt a price on carbon... so it&#039;s very important for Americans to learn more about what similar measures other countries are taking.  

As Greg pointed out, the main way the tax will hit Australian citizens is through a roughly 10 percent increase in domestic gas and electricity rates.  Since you&#039;ve installed solar electric panels on my roof, and energy-efficient devices where possible, the tax should hit you considerably less than others.  That dodgy &quot;Estimator&quot; doesn&#039;t take this into account.

You and Greg disagree on whether older people will receive less compensation.  So far I lean towards believing Greg, because he&#039;s providing references and has a long track record of being right about things, while you seem to be treating this &quot;Estimator&quot; as an actual calculation of your tax, which isn&#039;t true.  But that&#039;s just my guess so far.  I&#039;d be interested to hear more details of how this tax will work from any experts lurking out there!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;The compensation means that a couple a few years younger than us, and with the _same_ total income, will, in effect, NOT be paying more for electricity and natural gas, and wonâ€™t be motivated to respond.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Actually, the effect of being older is to &lt;i&gt;increase&lt;/i&gt; compensation.  A single person with an income of $50,000 p.a. has compensation jump from $303 to $718 if they are of pensionable age, since they receive both tax cuts and direct compensation.

It&#039;s true that the total income tax cut increases if that $50,000 is earned as $25,000 each by both members of a couple, rather than by just one person; it becomes $1,046, or $523 each.  But the income tax system has never treated one high income earner with a non-working spouse completely identically to two low-income earners whose total household income is the same.

The compensation for low income earners is generally enough to slightly overcompensate people with average power consumption, but that&#039;s not the same thing at all as making low income earners &lt;i&gt;exempt&lt;/i&gt; from the pricing effects of the carbon tax -- which is what it would actually take to remove any motivation to respond.  A low income earner who was profligate with electricity could end up with a greater increase in their power bill than their income tax cut, which would certainly motivate them to cut their consumption.  But even people with average power consumption, whose after-tax income ends up rising more than their power bill, would benefit if they reduced their consumption.

&lt;blockquote&gt;And I would mind less if the tax were to be used to invest in technologies such as thorium nuclear power plants or other non-fossil fuel technologies.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

No nuclear, but from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cleanenergyfuture.gov.au/clean-energy-future/securing-a-clean-energy-future/#content07&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A new $10 billion Clean Energy Finance Corporation will invest in the commercialisation and deployment of renewable energy, energy efficiency and clean technologies. A new Australian Renewable Energy Agency will streamline and coordinate the administration of $3.2 billion in existing support for renewable energy. And the $200 million Clean Technology Innovation Program will provide further support for businesses to support research and development (R&#038;D) in renewable energy and other low-pollution measures.&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Greg, haven&#039;t you been paying attention?
The compensation means that a couple a few years younger than us, and with the _same_ total income, will, in effect, NOT be paying more for electricity and natural gas, and won&#039;t be motivated to respond. 
Miss Gillard is on record as  &quot;Promising no Australian will pay more tax as a result of the long-anticipated carbon plan she unveiled yesterday&quot; If no Australian will pay more tax (directly or indirectly) then it fails in its purpose.. But the statement is a lie in any case, and hopefully will be punished at the next election.
I came across this blog by accident, and will now bid it goodbye. I am tired of people in countries that emit hugely greater amounts of carbon telling us what a great thing we have in our carbon tax, when whatever effect it has it will only be a pinprick in global terms. And I would mind less if the tax were to be used to invest in technologies such as thorium nuclear power plants or other non-fossil fuel technologies. But it won&#039;t be; it will be absorbed into the Government&#039;s general revenue.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;Exactly. While the tax, in principle, is paid by the highest users, in practice the â€˜compensatoryâ€™ income tax cuts, and the way they are calculated, mean that this is not the case.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So now your complaint boils down to the fact that people on lower incomes are getting income tax cuts, and you see this as some kind of distortion of the carbon tax itself?

The fact remains that everyone will be paying about 10% more for electricity and natural gas, and will be motivated to respond to that price change.  That this has been done in a way that won&#039;t leave the lowest income earners with a net disadvantage does not remove the price signal for anyone.]]></description>

That this has been done in a way that won&#8217;t leave the lowest income earners with a net disadvantage does not remove the price signal for anyone.</p>
