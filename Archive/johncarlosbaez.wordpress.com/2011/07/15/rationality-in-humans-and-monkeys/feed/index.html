					<description><![CDATA[Dear John Baez,

I just found out about the Azimuth work and will try to follow. 
Recall that someone once said &quot;If you want to do important work, work on important problems.&quot;

On the use of math in economics here&#039;s an article about &quot;neuroeconomics&quot; that might be interesting--


http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/shiller80/English


A possible way to apply neuroeconomics to Azimuth goals might go like this--

A. Study mathematical models of optimal capital budgeting and apply through think tanks like the Brookings Institution to suggested policy making.
For example, a model of optimal capital budgeting can be based on &quot;probability learning.&quot;

B. Based on the mathematical model, in the lab study what makes for the best performance in learning probability (and so optimal capital budgeting, now to include environmental factors per Azimuth perspectives).

For example, from experiments it&#039;s know that teams of two perform better at difficult problems than other sized teams. The team of two can often outperform the highest performing individual in difficult problems.
So in the lab, using for example (a) instruments to study neuroeconomic phenomena and (b) experimental game theory, find what skills should be devleoped to optimize probability learning by teams of two and how collections of teams of two can perform optimal capital budgeting (now defining optimality according to Azimuth perspectives).

c. Transfer results from the lab into training courses on negotiation and decision making in business schools. As well, develop computer- and media-based &quot;assessment centers&quot; and transfer to small start ups focused on helping companies develop and select candidates for key positions. At the same time develop software that can be used by companies to support optimal capital budgeting. Specify the software so it can supply non-proprietary information to analysts, credit ratings agencies and perhaps even government regulators.

Here is a little more detail--

Neuroeconomics came from behavioral economics, in which probability learning was a puzzle because it did not appear to be optimal for an individual and so violated the &quot;utility maximizer&quot; model in mathematical economics.
But probability learning is widely evident in creatures from fish to humans. And it seems to have been selected by evolution as optimal; yet in the mathematical economics of the utility maximizer, it is not optimal.

The neuroeconomics literature will point you to the likes of C. Randy Gallistel and his book &quot;The Organization of Learning.&quot;

Although it doesn&#039;t seem to be explicit anywhere that I&#039;ve looked, probability learning is key to the process of optimal foraging.

On probability learning--

Gallistel pitted sophomores in his class agains a lab rat. The rat had two rat-sized hallways with food delivery at each end. A light above would signal to the sophomores which of the two channels where food appeared in a trial.
The appearance of the food followed a probability distribution-- 25 percent of the trials it appeared at channel A. 75 percent of the time it appeared at channel B.

On each trail students are asked to guess on paper which channel, A or B, will give the food.
And the rat is given the choice to enter either channel A or channel B.

What the class finds at the completion of the trials is that students learn the probability involved. 
Their guesses are 25 percent of the time channel A and 75 percent of the time channel B.
The amount of food they would get is calculated.

Then Gallistel compares to the amount of food the rat got from running the trials. 
Fairly quickly it has settled on channel B where 75 percent of the food occurs.

So the rat outperforms every student in the class at getting food. 
The rat performed like a &quot;utility maximizer&quot; but the students did not.

Why? 
Gallistel&#039;s set-up gives different information to the students compared to the rat. 
The students see the light turn on when food occurs at either channel, but the rat does not. It is not allowed to see the light.
When it is given the same information, it also performs probability learning.

On optimal foraging--

In the same book, Gallistel describes optimal foraging by schools of fish.

By a probability distribution, prey fish come out of two different tubes in the water separated by some distance.
25 percent of the time, the prey fish come out of channel A. 75 percent of the time, they come out of channel B.

Very quickly, the predator school of fish divides itself into two sub-schools. 25 percent of the original school feed at channel A.
75 percent feed at channel B. After the school divides itself into these two sub-schools, it is rare to see any individual fish travel from one feeding tube to the other.

What&#039;s needed is a mathematical model of probability learning (I use Shannon-like terms), 

Then in the school foraging situation, model how (just as for the rat in the classroom) Shannon-like information terms for the unvisited channel are attenuated.

These mathematical models can be applied to the capital budgeting process in firms. Each dollar bill is like each fish in the school.

When equilibrium is reached in optimal foraging as above, the food per fish is the same for each channel. No individual fish can improve its situation by travelling to the other channel.
It&#039;s a Nash equilibrium with no fish wasting effort to travel to the other channel.

So probability learning produces optimality at the level of the school of fish. 
But for an individual (fish) alone, probability learning is not optimal, just as for the college sophomores in Gallistel&#039;s experiments.]]></description>

Category theory is such a broad and general thing that I don&#039;t know where one should start trying to mix it with the network-science business.  For example, the fact that we have these &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/networks_6.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;creation and annihilation operators&lt;/a&gt; suggests that there&#039;s something like &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/03/31/network-theory-part-2/#comment-4977&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;groupoidification&lt;/a&gt; lurking about.  Maybe time-evolution from one probability distribution over the possible numbers of rabbits to another such distribution can be thought of using &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/groupoidification/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;spans of groupoids&lt;/a&gt;?

(Which reminds me: I had a half-formulated idea about stuff types and statistical physics from last year &#8212; kind of pursuant to &lt;a href=&quot;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2010/06/this_weeks_finds_in_mathematic_60.html#c033601&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this conversation last summer&lt;/a&gt; &#8212; which I really out to dig out again and do a sanity re-evaluation upon.)]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;What do you guys think of the idea of “implied correlation”? That is where the gains of the stock market move in sink, and there is barely any differentiation in individual stock price movements. It has been as high as 80% recently.
 I would think if it ever hit 100%, it would be completely casino, and nothing to do with investment outlook except for the economy as a whole.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It depends on the circumstances. Sometimes it&#039;s just noise - something spooked the crack ferrets (a major corporation over- or undershot expectations in its quarterly report). Sometimes it&#039;s a legitimate reaction to a policy change - if the central bank raises the policy rate, you would expect all stocks to drop as stockholders liquidate to take advantage of this increase in the lazy money subsidy.

But generally it&#039;s not worthwhile to attempt to model daily noise, unless you&#039;re in the noise trading business. In which case I personally believe that your place of employment should be moved to Las Vegas, where you can make more socially beneficial use of your skills.]]></description>

I was thinking about the efficient market hypothesis last night and realized how comonoids are relevant again.

Suppose you are in a board room meeting and there are ten people sitting around the table.  Everyone is waiting for the report which I am about to bring into the room.  I have eleven copies of the report. Upon entering the room, I give exactly one report to each of the participants, and I take the last one.  The reports sit in front of the participants with the cover page face down.  At this point, one of the board members declares his contempt for the proceedings, takes the report without looking at it, stands and begins walking out of the room.  For a moment, he pauses, glares at me and then throws his copy into the garbage.

This is the following process:

$latex A \rightarrow I$

ie it is  an instance of deleting.  This demonstrates that even when information has been given to a participant, he can simply delete it.  The efficient market hypothesis would fail to describe this instance.  Another funny gag would be that he pretended to read it, but didn&#039;t.  In that case, I believe that he has updated his belief (as I did) but he didn&#039;t.]]></description>

<p>What do you guys think of the idea of &#8220;implied correlation&#8221;? That is where the gains of the stock market move in sink, and there is barely any differentiation in individual stock price movements. It has been as high as 80% recently.<br />

I would love to make some progress on this!

It&#039;s natural to hope that this could be a step towards modelling the interaction of more &#039;goal-oriented&#039; agents, but I think of it as a very small step.]]></description>

John,

A network theory of economics cast in a different mathematical language (i.e. category theory) would be immensely fruitful. I am an economist and find the current state of economics as  a science disgraceful. 

Rationality is I think a sub-issue once you embed the agents and their relations in dynamic evolving networks. A hyper-rational agent could not even reach her simple rational goal in a dynamic network (links being formed and severed pairwise, one by one or via coalition). S. Goyal&#039;s book, Connections, tells all.

 However, a self-interested agent or an organization or even a bunch of agents like (firms+politicians+military) can partially achieve higher benefits by a threat of leaving the network. Private and social welfare almost always diverge. The experiments recently take into account of the significance of network topography in behavioral economics. 

The conventional neoclassical economics, even if it could use the frontier math, would be flawed. It assumes either in a connected network (as in General Equilibrium theory) or an empty of a very sparse networks (such as buyer-seller or star-networks). 

Jason Potts&#039; book (http://books.google.com/books?id=xDwfIY3NSVUC&#038;printsec=frontcover&#038;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&#038;cad=0#v=onepage&#038;q&#038;f=false) is a valuable attempt; but I suspect it can give the clues for your category/network theory of economics.  

We have a huge mountain to climb. Apart from creating a relevant language for economics and model a dynamic evolutionary network economics, we have to also persuade the many believers in the trade that the assets they possess (the method and the modeling tools of conventional economics) value much less than they think (what Kahneman and Tversky call endowment bias).]]></description>
