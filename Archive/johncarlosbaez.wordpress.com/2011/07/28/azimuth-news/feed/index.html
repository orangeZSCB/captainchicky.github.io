					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/07/28/azimuth-news/#comment-7009&quot;&gt;Tim van Beek&lt;/a&gt;.

I don&#039;t think Lisa and I will get any information on who invented the &lt;i&gt;guqin&lt;/i&gt; that isn&#039;t publicly available.  

I have read in &lt;i&gt;Saudi Aramco World&lt;/i&gt; that the zither percolated into Europe via the Arabs.  This magazine is a somewhat biased source: it&#039;s produced by the main Saudi oil company, and its goal is to encourage an appreciation of Arab and Muslim culture.  (But it&#039;s an interesting magazine, beautifully illustrated, and subscriptions are free.  I&#039;m happy to get something back from the price I pay at the pump!)

Wikipedia has a somewhat short and stubby &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zither&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;article on the zither&lt;/a&gt;, which says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

The zither is a musical string instrument, most commonly found in Slovenia, Austria, Hungary, northwestern Croatia, the southern regions of Germany, alpine Europe and East Asian cultures, including China. The term &quot;citre&quot; is also used more broadly, to describe the entire family of stringed instruments in which the strings do not extend beyond the sounding box, including the hammered dulcimer, psaltery, Appalachian dulcimer, guqin, guzheng (Chinese zither), koto, gusli, kantele, gayageum, đàn tranh, kanun, autoharp, santoor, yangqin, piano, harpsichord, santur, swarmandal, and others.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It would be nice to create a &#039;phylogenetic tree&#039; of these instruments.  Do they all have a common ancestor?  We can say the piano came from the harpischord; did the harpsichord evolve gradually from some more primitive zither?  I&#039;m aware of clavichords, virginals, and spinets, which should fit into this tree somehow... are these &lt;i&gt;ancestors&lt;/i&gt; of the harpsichord?  

 I&#039;m not sure these questions have yes-or-no answers: unlike organisms, musical instruments do not reproduce themselves, so the concept of &#039;ancestor&#039; is a bit more fuzzy.

The Wikipedia article also says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
While the term zither is mentioned in &lt;i&gt;Daniel&lt;/i&gt; during the Jewish exile of 606 BC, the earliest known instrument of the zither family is a Chinese &lt;i&gt;guqin&lt;/i&gt; [a fretless instrument], found in the tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng dating from 433 BC, featuring tuning pegs, a bridge and goose-like feet.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guqin&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;article on the &lt;i&gt;guqin&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; goes back further:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Legend has it that the qin, the most revered of all Chinese musical instruments, has a history of about 5,000 years. This legend states that the legendary figures of China&#039;s pre-history — Fuxi, Shennong and Huang Di, the &quot;Yellow Emperor&quot; — were involved in its creation. Nearly almost all qin books and tablature collections published prior to the twentieth century state this as the factual origins of the qin, although this is now presently viewed as mythology. It is mentioned in Chinese writings dating back nearly 3,000 years, and related instruments have been found in Tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng from about 2,500 years ago. The exact origins of the qin is still a very much continuing subject of debate over the past few decades.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So it&#039;s possible that the &lt;i&gt;guqin&lt;/i&gt; is the ancestor of all known zither-like instruments... though I have no idea, and perhaps nobody knows.  

There&#039;s even a Wikipedia article called &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guqin_history&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Guqin history&lt;/a&gt;, which goes deeper.]]></description>
