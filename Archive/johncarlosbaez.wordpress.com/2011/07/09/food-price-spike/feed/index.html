					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/07/09/food-price-spike/#comment-6687&quot;&gt;Bruce Smith&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi, Bruce!  I&#039;m proud to say we have an article on that organization:

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Climate+and+Energy+Project&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Climate and Energy Project&lt;/a&gt;, Azimuth Library.

They have a pretty interesting approach...

&lt;b&gt;Idea&lt;/b&gt;

The Climate and Energy Project or CEP is an organization based in the Midwestern US that tries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by increasing energy efficiency and developing renewable energies in a sustainable manner.  They emphasize values that are widely held by people in this region:

&#8226; Stewardship: Safeguarding the earth&#039;s resources for future generations.

&#8226; Resilience: Developing flexible energy and food systems that have the strength and diversity necessary to survive disruptions in climate or national security.

&#8226; Balance: Acknowledging that all energy technologies have benefits and burdens, and that citizenship demands weighing this balance carefully.

&#8226; Innovation: Supporting creative implementation of renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies that are environmentally and socially sustainable.

&lt;b&gt; &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; story &lt;/b&gt;

&#8226; Leslie Kaufman, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/19/science/earth/19fossil.html?partner=rss&#038;emc=rss&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;In Kansas, climate skeptics embrace cleaner energy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;, 18 October 2010.

A quote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
 The energy experiment started as a kitchen-table challenge three years ago.

Over dinner, Wes Jackson, the president of the Land Institute, which promotes environmentally sustainable agriculture, complained to Ms. Jackson, his daughter-in-law, that even though many local farmers would suffer from climate change, few believed that it was happening or were willing to take steps to avoid it.

Why did the conversation have to be about climate change? Ms. Jackson countered. If the goal was to persuade people to reduce their use of fossil fuels, why not identify issues that motivated them instead of getting stuck on something that did not?

Only 48 percent of people in the Midwest agree with the statement that there is &quot;solid evidence that the average temperature on earth has been getting warmer,&quot; a poll conducted in the fall of 2009 by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press showed &#8212; far fewer than in other regions of the country. 

The Jacksons already knew firsthand that such skepticism was not just broad, but also deep. Like opposition to abortion or affirmations of religious faith, they felt, it was becoming a cultural marker that helped some Kansans define themselves.

Nevertheless, Ms. Jackson felt so strongly that this opposition could be overcome that she left a job as development director at the University of Kansas in Lawrence to start the Climate and Energy Project with a one-time grant from the Land Institute. (The project is now independent.)

At the outset she commissioned focus groups of independents and Republicans around Wichita and Kansas City to get a sense of where they stood. Many participants suggested that global warming could be explained mostly by natural earth cycles, and a vocal minority even asserted that it was a cynical hoax perpetrated by climate scientists who were greedy for grants.

Yet Ms. Jackson found plenty of openings. Many lamented the nation&#039;s dependence on foreign oil. Some articulated an amorphous desire, often based in religious values, to protect the earth. Some even spoke of changes in the natural world &#8212; birds arriving weeks earlier in the spring than they had before &#8212; leading her to wonder whether, deep down, they might suspect that climate change was afoot. 

Ms. Jackson settled on a three-pronged strategy. Invoking the notion of thrift, she set out to persuade towns to compete with one another to become more energy-efficient. She worked with civic leaders to embrace green jobs as a way of shoring up or rescuing their communities. And she spoke with local ministers about &#034;creation care,&#034; the obligation of Christians to act as stewards of the world that God gave them, even creating a sermon bank with talking points they could download. 

Relatively little was said about climate.

&quot;I don&#039;t recall us being recruited under a climate change label at all,&quot; said Stacy Huff, an executive for the Coronado Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America, which was enlisted to help the project. Mr. Huff describes himself as &#034;somewhat skeptical&#034; about global warming.

Mr. Huff said the project workers emphasized conservation for future generations when they recruited his group. The message resonated, and the scouts went door to door in low-income neighborhoods to deliver and install weatherization kits.

&#034;It is in our DNA to leave a place better than we found it,&#034; he said.

Elliot Lahn, a community development planner for Merriam, a city that reduced its energy use by 5 percent, said that when public meetings were held on the six-town competition to save energy, some residents offered their view that global warming was a hoax.

But they were very eager to hear about saving money, Mr. Lahn said. &#034;That&#039;s what really motivated them&#034;. 

Jerry Clasen, a grain farmer in Reno County, south of Salina, said he largely discounted global warming. &#034;I believe we are going through a cycle and it is not a big deal,&#034; he said. But his ears pricked up when project workers came to town to talk about harnessing wind power. &#034;There is no sense in our dependency on foreign oil,&#034; he said, &#034;especially since we have got this resource here&#034;. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Independent of whether there is agreement about the cause of climate change or other &quot;extreme events&quot;, if there is agreement that they are to be expected, then maybe there can be agreement that they ought to be prepared for (with general robustness, research and development of alternatives, etc).

I can&#039;t find the reference, but this reminds me of a news article I read a few months ago about an organization in central USA to get farms and local rural communities to use energy more efficiently (and maybe to engage in other more sustainable practices; I forget the details, the organization name, etc). This organization&#039;s originator was motivated by climate change worries, but she found that to successfully motivate farmers &#038; local leaders for the changes she favored, focusing on that was counterproductive (since those theories were controversial there), but focusing on other benefits (like lowering costs) was very successful.]]></description>

p.f.henshaw said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Oil, gas and coal are converging on this same ~20%/year price rises for the past 10 years too.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Oil prices, while volatile, have risen on average about 10% per year over the last five years:

Coal prices have risen on average about 5% per year over the last five years:

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/annual/pdf/sec7_19.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Coal Prices, Selected Years, 1949-2009&lt;/a&gt; (calculated using years 2005-2009).

p.f.henshaw also said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
 ... demonstrating that the world resource supply chain is relatively “maxed out” and does not have spare capacity ... &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Businesses operate most efficiently at close to 100% capacity and strive to do so. Normal response is to expand capacity when demand is &lt;i&gt;expected&lt;/i&gt; to grow, not in response to transient shocks. Some people think that is what the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is for :)]]></description>
