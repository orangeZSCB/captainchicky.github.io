I won&#039;t be surprised by Frederik&#039;s choice of flight year.  But I &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; be surprised if he wins the bet!  Should that have been part of the conditions of the bet---that I only lose if I&#039;m surprised?

Hmm, unfortunately &lt;a href=&quot;http://longbets.org/rules/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;rules&lt;/a&gt; at Long Bets don&#039;t allow for our particular bet. 

&#8226; The stakes in Long Bets involve money &#8212; a minimum of $200.

&#8226; The money is immediately paid to the Long Now Foundation, where it&#039;s tax-deductible.

&#8226; When the bet is settled, the winner&#039;s money goes to a charity of their choice.

&#8226; Long Bets odds are always even,

(&quot;Odds are always even&quot; sounds funny to me.  In case this idiomatic phrase is incomprehensible to the non-native English speakers here, it means that each party wins the same amount of money, if they win.  This seems extremely restrictive, since it prevents people from betting on low-probability events!  I also think it limits the ability of Long Bets to accumulate accurate information about future events.)]]></description>

Hasn&#039;t happened yet - most people seem to know faster-than-light neutrinos are a long shot.  

But now they can read your comment!]]></description>
