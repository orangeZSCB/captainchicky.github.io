We&#039;ll have to see how well these buycotts work.  They&#039;re different than just telling people &#039;buy green&#039;, because---at least in the example given above---the consumers are actually going to businesses and saying &quot;if you do X, we will buy lots of stuff&quot;.  

And they buy the stuff on one day, not all the time.  So the effect on prices would be somewhat different.]]></description>

Yes, raging capitalists often say that the market solves many problems: if you don&#039;t like X, don&#039;t support it with your dollars.

They may not like it when consumers &lt;i&gt;band together&lt;/i&gt; to do this: organized consumers could in theory be just as threatening to some businesses as organized labor!  

But oh well: the cat&#039;s out of the bag now.

					<description><![CDATA[The problem exposed by Matt McIrvin is present not only in these interesting &quot;buycotts&quot; but also in the popular scheme of making sustainable (or organic, not quite the same) agriculture production economically viable by labelling the products as &quot;green&quot;. The effect of this labelling is more of partitioning the demand by finding those subgroups of the consumers who can and would buy the products for more than the market price, rather than diverting consumers from the competence.

Sometimes these labellings, and maybe also these buycott organization&#039;s actions, end up benefiting a few producers economically rather than helping to solve the general enviromental problems.

Note that I understand that most of the times, sustainable production cannot compete in short-term with extractive production if the goods are indistinguishable. Maybe someone has counter-arguments for some of this affirmations, I&#039;d like to be proved wrong.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m one of the dozens of people I know locally and on the internet who practice this method when choosing retailers. And I agree with H.V. that it&#039;s a movement that&#039;s overdue for active promotion.

I understand the reasoning behind Mr. McIrvin&#039;s criticisms, and I certainly don&#039;t think that grass roots consumer action should replace change in government policy or industry practices, but the various approaches are not mutually exclusive.

I occasionally find myself guilty of the applying Mr. McIrvin&#039;s standards to complex problems, but I try to avoid adopting positions that prevent me from taking any action at all in the face of the lack of the perfect action. Environmental change is a great example of a complex issue that requires complex and varying responses from all facets of society. Delaying action until the perfect solution reveals itself is a strategy that will yield inaction and inevitable failure.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A friend who is a raging capitalist republican espouses essentially the same idea;  punish by not buying from those with whom you disagree, reward those you do.  The interesting thing is the active promotion of this, which I think is genius, John.]]></description>
