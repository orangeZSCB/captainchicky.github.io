Well, maybe because the rock-paper-scissors game is Chinese too (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissor#History). Indeed, for 4 or 5 players the rock-paper-scissors game does not offer enough options to avoid repetitions, but wu-xing offers :)]]></description>

Do you know about cohomology of anything else, like topological spaces or simplicial complexes?  A graph is a special case of either of those.  

I&#039;m not trying to intimidate you by boosting the level of generality---honest.  It&#039;s just that if you happen to know some other kinds of cohomology, learning about the cohomology of graphs may be a lot easier than you think!  But cohomology of graphs is, in fact, about the easiest kind of all.  

If you only want to learn about the cohomology of graphs, you could learn it from the end of &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week293.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;week293&lt;/a&gt;, where I apply it to electrical circuits, or from this book:

which takes more time but goes into more detail.

Sometime &lt;i&gt;fairly&lt;/i&gt; soon my Network Theory notes on this blog will get into electrical circuits, and then I&#039;ll have to explain the cohomology of graphs.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made a system of labels for each molecule:

Label the hydrogens of the ethyl cation with letters a through e.  The state is labeled with the hydrogen pair and an orientation - if it was ab - cde, this is ab+.  If it was cde - ab, label as ab-.

Fill out the graph this way, and label transitions (edges) with the hydrogen that changes place.

For the pentachloride we&#039;ll have a similar system.  Label each of the outer atoms with letters a through e.  Each state gets a label that is the axis pair, in alphabetical order.  Use alphabetical order of the axial atoms to determine an orientation - up or down.  If the ordering of the axis matches the orientation, it&#039;s +.  If it does not, it&#039;s -.

Psuedorotations will be labeled by the axial atom that does not participate.

Using the diagram for the original system, plot the edges and their labels on a second graph.  Put the ab+ state in the same position as the original graph.  Now, just go around using the moves already written as psuedorotations.  These will be valid psuedorotations and will not repeat.  If you fill in the missing edges, they&#039;ll match the original graph.

This does not distinguish the states of the pentachloride into two sets the way the original system did - the original graph alternates the +/- around the graph (blue/red states), while this one does not.

It&#039;s possible some similar system would fix this, but I&#039;m done with it for now.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Okay, I think the following solution is correct.  This time I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/10/23/a-math-puzzle-coming-from-chemistry/#comment-8661&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Twan van Laarhoven&#039;s idea&lt;/a&gt; for computing that extra bit of information.  It not only works better than my earlier wrong approach; it&#039;s also easy to give a full proof that it works.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Puzzle&lt;/b&gt;.  Show that the graph with states of a trigonal bipyramidal molecule as vertices and pseudorotations as edges is indeed the Desargues graph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Answer.&lt;/b&gt;  To be specific, let&#039;s use iron pentacarbonyl as our example of a trigonal bipyramidal molecule:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_pentacarbonyl&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;none&quot; src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/200px-Iron-pentacarbonyl-from-xtal-3D-balls.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It suffices to construct a 1-1 correspondence between the states of this molecule and those of the ethyl cation, such that two states of this molecule are connected by a transition if and only if the same holds for the corresponding states of the ethyl cation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&#039;s the key idea: the ethyl cation has 5 hydrogens, with 2 attached to one carbon and 3 attached to the other.  Similarly, the trigonal bipyramidal molecule has 5 carbonyl grops, with 2 axial and 3 equatorial.  We&#039;ll use this resemblance to set up our correspondence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are various ways to describe states of the ethyl cation, but this is the best for us.  Number the hydrogens 1,2,3,4,5.  Then a state of the ethyl cation consists of a partition of the set {1,2,3,4,5} into a 2-element set and a 3-element set, together with one extra bit of information, saying which carbon has 2 hydrogens attached to it.  This extra bit is the color here:

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desargues_graph&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;none&quot; src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/300px-Desargues_graph_2COL.svg.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do transitions look like in this description?  When a transition occurs, two hydrogens that belonged to the 3-element set now become part of the 2-element set.  Meanwhile, both hydrogens that belonged to the 2-element set now become part of the 3-element set.  (Ironically, the one hydrogen that hops is the one that stays in the 3-element set.)  Moreover, the extra bit of information changes.  That&#039;s why every edge goes from a red dot to a blue one, or vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, to solve the puzzle, we need to show that the same description also works for the states and transitions of iron pentacarbonyl!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, we need to describe its states as ways of partitioning the set {1,2,3,4,5} into a 2-element set and a 3-element set, together with one extra bit of information.  And we need its transitions to switch two elements of the 2-element set with two of the 3-element set, while changing that extra bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do this, number the carbonyl groups 1,2,3,4,5.  The 2-element set consists of the axial ones, while the 3-element set consists of the equatorial ones.  When a transition occurs, two of axial ones trade places with two of the equatorial ones, like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berry_mechanism&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;none&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/700px-Iron-pentacarbonyl-Berry-mechanism.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, now we just need to figure out what that extra bit of information is, and why it always &lt;i&gt;changes&lt;/i&gt; when a transition occurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&#039;s how we calculate that extra bit.  Hold the iron pentacarbonyl molecule vertically with one of the equatorial carbonyl groups pointing to your left.  Remember, the carbonyl groups are numbered.  So, write a list of these numbers, say (a,b,c,d,e), where a is the top axial one, b,c,d are the equatorial ones listed in counterclockwise order starting from the one pointing left, and e is the bottom axial one.  This list is some permutation of the list (1,2,3,4,5).  Take the sign of this permutation to be our bit!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&#039;s do an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berry_mechanism&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;none&quot; src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/Iron_pentacarbonyl_labelled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we get the list (2,5,3,1,4) since 2 is on top, 4 is on bottom, and 5,3,1 are the equatorial guys listed counterclockwise starting from the one at left.  The list (2,5,3,1,4) is an odd permutation of (1,2,3,4,5), so our bit of information is &lt;i&gt;odd&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course we must check that this bit is well-defined: namely, that it doesn&#039;t change if we &lt;i&gt;rotate&lt;/i&gt; the molecule.  Rotating it a third of a turn gives an even permutation of the equatorial guys and leaves the axial ones alone, so this is an even permutation.  Flipping it over gives an odd permutation of the equatorial guys, but it also gives an odd permutation of the axial ones, so it too is an even permutation.  So, rotating the molecule doesn&#039;t change the sign of the permutation we compute from it.  The sign is thus a well-defined function of the state of the molecule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we must to check that this sign changes whenever our molecule undergoes a transition.  For this we need to check that any transition changes our list of numbers by an odd permutation.  Since all transitions are conjugate in the permutation group, it suffices to consider one example:

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berry_mechanism&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;none&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/pseudorotation.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we started with a state giving the list (2,5,3,1,4).  The transition took us to a state that gives the list (3,5,4,2,1) if we hold the molecule so that 3 is pointing up and 5 to the left.  The reader can check that going from one list to another requires an &lt;i&gt;odd&lt;/i&gt; permutation.  So we&#039;re done. &lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

</p>
<p>So, now we just need to figure out what that extra bit of information is, and why it always <i>changes</i> when a transition occurs.</p>

<p>Here we get the list (2,5,3,1,4) since 2 is on top, 4 is on bottom, and 5,3,1 are the equatorial guys listed counterclockwise starting from the one at left.  The list (2,5,3,1,4) is an odd permutation of (1,2,3,4,5), so our bit of information is <i>odd</i>.</p>
<p>Of course we must check that this bit is well-defined: namely, that it doesn&#8217;t change if we <i>rotate</i> the molecule.  Rotating it a third of a turn gives an even permutation of the equatorial guys and leaves the axial ones alone, so this is an even permutation.  Flipping it over gives an odd permutation of the equatorial guys, but it also gives an odd permutation of the axial ones, so it too is an even permutation.  So, rotating the molecule doesn&#8217;t change the sign of the permutation we compute from it.  The sign is thus a well-defined function of the state of the molecule.</p>
<p>Next we must to check that this sign changes whenever our molecule undergoes a transition.  For this we need to check that any transition changes our list of numbers by an odd permutation.  Since all transitions are conjugate in the permutation group, it suffices to consider one example:</p>
<p><div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berry_mechanism" rel="nofollow"><img border="none" width="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/pseudorotation.png" alt="" /></a></div>
</p>
<p>Here we started with a state giving the list (2,5,3,1,4).  The transition took us to a state that gives the list (3,5,4,2,1) if we hold the molecule so that 3 is pointing up and 5 to the left.  The reader can check that going from one list to another requires an <i>odd</i> permutation.  So we&#8217;re done. </p>

It seems to me that there&#039;s a necessary symmetry missing when you use the numerical order. Without it the relationship between up/down order and clockwise/counterclockwise order is inconsistent. Using a cycle and defining order in terms of shortest distance in the cycle (so 5 is after 3 but before 1 and 2) fixes this. But then there is also a difference if the axial atoms are consecutive in the cycle or 2 steps apart (those are the only two possibilities). If you think of that and the cw/ccw as bits, then one of those two bits flips in each transition. There&#039;s probably a nicer way to formulate that but I think it&#039;s correct.]]></description>

Ugh, you&#039;re right!  When try this example I start with

1
345
2

(in &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/10/23/a-math-puzzle-coming-from-chemistry/#comment-8673&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;your notation&lt;/a&gt;)

and wind up with 

3
234
5

Zounds!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That bit doesn&#039;t always change. Try the one with 1 and 2 as axial and 3, 4, 5 clockwise looking down. Make the transition to 3 and 5  as axial and you&#039;ll get 1, 2, 4 clockwise looking down, so no bit change. It&#039;s more complicated than this. I started out thinking like this, but ended up with what I posted in my last comment.]]></description>
