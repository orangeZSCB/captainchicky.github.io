&lt;blockquote&gt;How did you think of defining the dots as {i,i+1} etc.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Trial and error!  The picture was symmetrical enough that it seemed likely that some systematic assignment of sets to the vertices would work, and {i,i+1} for five of the 2-element sets was a simple thing to start with.  From there, I just played around with similar expressions for the other dots, until I found ones that met all the requirements.]]></description>

How did you think of defining the dots as:

$latex \{i, i+1\}, \{i+1,i+4\}$ ; $latex \{i, i+1, i+4\}, \{i+1, i+2, i+4\}$

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Why are we calling $latex H$ the laplacian of the graph?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When our graph is a n-dimensional lattice, my formula for $latex H$ gives us the usual discrete approximation to the Laplacian on $latex \mathbb{R}^n$.  This is how you numerically compute a Laplacian using a computer.  I explained this in &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2013/05/19/graph-laplacians/#comment-28934&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;a comment on my article about graph Laplacians&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In QM, $latex H$ has a laplacian term and a potential term. Are we considering the $latex \displaystyle{ d(x) \Psi(x) }$ in 

$latex \displaystyle{ (H \psi)(x) = \sum_{y: (x,y) \in E} \Psi(y) \quad - \quad d(x) \Psi(x) }$ 

to be the potential term ?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

No, all this is the Laplacian term.  I&#039;m considering a free particle, with no potential.  But we can add a potential term if we want, too:

$latex (V \psi)(x) = V(x) \psi(x) $

for some real-valued function $latex V$ defined on the vertices of the graph.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I did not understand how we are taking the same $latex H$ for the corresponding SM and QM problems?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It&#039;s a generalization of how we use the Laplacian both in Schr&#246;dinger&#039;s equation 

$latex \displaystyle{ \frac{d}{d t} \psi = -\nabla^2 \psi } $

(for a free particle in quantum mechanics) and the heat equation 

$latex \displaystyle{ \frac{d}{d t} \psi = \nabla^2 \psi }$
 
(for a free particle in stochastic mechanics).  I explained this at the start of this post.   

Mathematically, the only difference between Schr&#246;dinger&#039;s equation and the heat equation is the factor of $latex -i.$   But one describes how amplitudes change with time, while the other describes how probabilities change with time!  This is well-known, but it&#039;s a fascinating and mysterious thing.  This whole series of notes is about taking techniques from quantum mechanics and applying them to stochastic mechanics, so it&#039;s good to study their &#039;overlap&#039;.

In &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/11/04/network-theory-part-16/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Part  16&lt;/a&gt; I&#039;ll explain that there&#039;s a large class of operators $latex H$ such that $latex \exp(-i t H)$ is unitary and $latex \exp(t H)$ is stochastic.  The most important example is when $latex H$ is the Laplacian.  Graph Laplacians are also examples.]]></description>
