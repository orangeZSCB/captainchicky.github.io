					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/10/04/network-theory-part-11/#comment-28845&quot;&gt;Arjun Jain&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_calculus&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;functional calculus&lt;/a&gt; allows you to apply any function $latex f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ to any self-adjoint $latex n \times n$ matrix (and thus any self-adjoint operator on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space), or any holomorphic function $latex f: \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}$ to any $latex n \times n$ matrix (and thus to any linear operator on a finite-dimensional space). 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Also, when we have f(O), does f being smooth mean that, it can be expanded in the form of a power series in O?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

We can do that when f is &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holomorphic_function&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;holomorphic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.   This means that

$latex \displaystyle{ f(x) = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty   c_n x^n }$

and the power series converges for all $latex x \in \mathbb{C}.$  You can then prove that

$latex \displaystyle{ \sum_{n = 0}^\infty   c_n O^n }$

converges for all matrices $latex O$, so we can define $latex f(O)$ to be this.

When $latex O$ is self-adjoint we can go further, and define $latex f(O)$ for any function $latex f$, simply by saying that $latex f(O)$ has the same eigenvectors as $latex O$, and

$latex O \psi = \lambda \psi \Rightarrow f(O) \psi = f(\lambda) \psi$

We need $latex O$ to be self-adjoint here because that guarantees that we can choose a &lt;i&gt;basis&lt;/i&gt; of eigenvectors of $latex O$.

For some reason I chose to focus on the case where $latex O$ is smooth, but there was no need to do this.  Since $latex O$ is self-adjoint, I could have assumed $latex f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is any function whatsoever.

					<description><![CDATA[Word spreads fast!  Here&#039;s an announcement of a talk at the Oxford &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/seminars/oasis/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;OASIS&lt;/a&gt; series.  That stands for Oxford Advanced Seminar on Informatic Structures.

&lt;blockquote&gt;

Dear all,

For this week&#039;s OASIS seminar we have the pleasure of a talk by Harvey Brown, the professor in philosophy of physics at Oxford who is well-known for his work on the foundations of quantum mechanics, relativity theory, and the role of symmetry principles in physics, including several books. Moreover, he is a very clear and entertaining speaker! This Friday he will convince us that we need to take symmetries and their subtleties more seriously.

Time and place: This Friday, 2pm, Lecture Theatre B, Department of Computer Science.

Title: Noether&#039;s famous 1918 symmetry theorem -- what does it prove?

Abstract: Recently, Brendan Fong and John Baez have provided an analogue in stochastic mechanics to what they call Noether&#039;s theorem in quantum mechanics. Noether&#039;s original theorem, relating symmetries and conservation principles, was the first in a series of theorems she proved in 1918 within a program in the calculus of variations, inspired by interpretational problems related to conservations laws in general relativity. I will sketch the background to Noether&#039;s work and give special emphasis to the form and meaning of her &quot;first&quot; theorem. An unusual application of the theorem to quantum mechanics will be exploited.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Philosophers of physics being as they are, the phrase &quot;what they call&quot; makes me afraid he&#039;s planning to chide me for using the term &quot;Noether&#039;s theorem&quot; in a very extended sense, not very close to that of her original 1918 paper.  Physicists being as they are, such chiding wouldn&#039;t stop me.  But I&#039;m curious to hear what he actually says.  The talk will be videotaped and put on the OASIS website.  Furthermore, Brendan is now at Oxford and can hear the talk in person!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Since nobody did the puzzle this time, I&#039;ll have to do it myself.  &lt;img src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/emoticons/grumpy.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;  

&lt;b&gt;Puzzle.&lt;/b&gt; Suppose $latex U$ is a stochastic operator and $latex O$ is an observable.   Show that $latex O$ commutes with $latex U$ iff the expected values of $latex O$ &lt;i&gt;and its square&lt;/i&gt; don&#039;t change when we evolve our state one time step using $latex U.$  In other words, show that
 
$latex [O,U] =0 $

if and only if 

$latex \displaystyle{  \int O U \psi = \int O \psi } $

and

$latex \displaystyle{ \int O^2 U \psi = \int O^2 \psi } $

for all stochastic states $latex \psi.$  

&lt;b&gt;Answer.&lt;/b&gt;  One direction is easy: if $latex [O,U] = 0$ then $latex [O^n,U] = 0$ for all $latex n,$ so

$latex \displaystyle{ \int O^n U \psi = \int U O^n \psi = \int O^n \psi } $

where in the last step we use the fact that $latex U$ is stochastic.

For the converse direction we can use the same tricks that worked for Markov processes.  Assume that

$latex \displaystyle{  \int O U \psi = \int O \psi }  $

and

$latex \displaystyle{ \int O^2 U \psi = \int O^2 \psi } $

for all stochastic states $latex \psi$.  These imply that

$latex \displaystyle{ \sum_{i \in X} O_i U_{i j} = O_j } \qquad \qquad \, (1) $

and 

$latex \displaystyle{ \sum_{i \in X} O^2_i U_{i j} = O^2_j } \qquad \qquad (2) $

We wish to show that $latex [O,U]= 0$.   Note that

$latex \begin{array}{ccl} [O,U]_{i j} &#038;=&#038; \displaystyle{ \sum_{k \in X} (O_{i k}U_{k j} - U_{i k} O_{k j}) } \\ \\  &#038;=&#038; (O_i-O_j)U_{i j} \end{array} $

To show this is always zero, we&#039;ll show that when $latex U_{i j} \ne 0$, then $latex O_j = O_i$.  This says that when our system can hop from one state to another, the observable $latex O$ must take the same value on these two states.

For this, in turn, it&#039;s enough to show that the following sum vanishes for any $latex j \in X$:

$latex \displaystyle{ \sum_{i \in X} (O_j-O_i)^2 U_{i j} }  $

Why?   The matrix elements $latex U_{i j}$ are nonnegative since $latex U$ is stochastic.  Thus the sum can only vanish if each term vanishes, meaning that $latex O_j = O_i$ whenever $latex U_{i j} \ne 0$.

To show the sum vanishes, let&#039;s expand it:

$latex \begin{array}{ccl} \displaystyle{ \sum_{i \in X} (O_j-O_i)^2 U_{i j} } &#038;=&#038; \displaystyle{ \sum_i (O_j^2 U_{i j}- 2O_j O_i U_{i j} +O_i^2 U_{i j}) }  \\  \\ &#038;=&#038; \displaystyle{  O_j^2\sum_i U_{i j} - 2O_j \sum_i O_i U_{i j} + \sum_i O_i^2 U_{i j} } \end{array} $

Now, since (1) and (2) hold for all stochastic states $latex \psi$, this equals

$latex \displaystyle{  O_j^2\sum_i U_{i j} - 2O_j^2 + O_j^2  } $

But this is zero because $latex U$ is stochastic, which implies

$latex \sum_i U_{i j} = 1$

So, we&#039;re done!]]></description>

<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B++%5Cint+O+U+%5Cpsi+%3D+%5Cint+O+%5Cpsi+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{  &#92;int O U &#92;psi = &#92;int O &#92;psi } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cint+O%5E2+U+%5Cpsi+%3D+%5Cint+O%5E2+%5Cpsi+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;int O^2 U &#92;psi = &#92;int O^2 &#92;psi } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>for all stochastic states <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpsi.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;psi." class="latex" />  </p>
<p><b>Answer.</b>  One direction is easy: if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5BO%2CU%5D+%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="[O,U] = 0" class="latex" /> then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5BO%5En%2CU%5D+%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="[O^n,U] = 0" class="latex" /> for all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n," class="latex" /> so</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cint+O%5En+U+%5Cpsi+%3D+%5Cint+U+O%5En+%5Cpsi+%3D+%5Cint+O%5En+%5Cpsi+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;int O^n U &#92;psi = &#92;int U O^n &#92;psi = &#92;int O^n &#92;psi } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>where in the last step we use the fact that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=U&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="U" class="latex" /> is stochastic.</p>
<p>For the converse direction we can use the same tricks that worked for Markov processes.  Assume that</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B++%5Cint+O+U+%5Cpsi+%3D+%5Cint+O+%5Cpsi+%7D++&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{  &#92;int O U &#92;psi = &#92;int O &#92;psi }  " class="latex" /></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Cint+O%5E2+U+%5Cpsi+%3D+%5Cint+O%5E2+%5Cpsi+%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;int O^2 U &#92;psi = &#92;int O^2 &#92;psi } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>for all stochastic states <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpsi&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;psi" class="latex" />.  These imply that</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Csum_%7Bi+%5Cin+X%7D+O_i+U_%7Bi+j%7D+%3D+O_j+%7D+%5Cqquad+%5Cqquad+%5C%2C+%281%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;sum_{i &#92;in X} O_i U_{i j} = O_j } &#92;qquad &#92;qquad &#92;, (1) " class="latex" /></p>
<p>and </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Csum_%7Bi+%5Cin+X%7D+O%5E2_i+U_%7Bi+j%7D+%3D+O%5E2_j+%7D+%5Cqquad+%5Cqquad+%282%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;sum_{i &#92;in X} O^2_i U_{i j} = O^2_j } &#92;qquad &#92;qquad (2) " class="latex" /></p>
<p>We wish to show that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5BO%2CU%5D%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="[O,U]= 0" class="latex" />.   Note that</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Bccl%7D+%5BO%2CU%5D_%7Bi+j%7D+%26%3D%26+%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Csum_%7Bk+%5Cin+X%7D+%28O_%7Bi+k%7DU_%7Bk+j%7D+-+U_%7Bi+k%7D+O_%7Bk+j%7D%29+%7D+%5C%5C+%5C%5C++%26%3D%26+%28O_i-O_j%29U_%7Bi+j%7D+%5Cend%7Barray%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;begin{array}{ccl} [O,U]_{i j} &amp;=&amp; &#92;displaystyle{ &#92;sum_{k &#92;in X} (O_{i k}U_{k j} - U_{i k} O_{k j}) } &#92;&#92; &#92;&#92;  &amp;=&amp; (O_i-O_j)U_{i j} &#92;end{array} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>To show this is always zero, we&#8217;ll show that when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=U_%7Bi+j%7D+%5Cne+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="U_{i j} &#92;ne 0" class="latex" />, then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O_j+%3D+O_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O_j = O_i" class="latex" />.  This says that when our system can hop from one state to another, the observable <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O" class="latex" /> must take the same value on these two states.</p>
<p>For this, in turn, it&#8217;s enough to show that the following sum vanishes for any <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j+%5Cin+X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="j &#92;in X" class="latex" />:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Csum_%7Bi+%5Cin+X%7D+%28O_j-O_i%29%5E2+U_%7Bi+j%7D+%7D++&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{ &#92;sum_{i &#92;in X} (O_j-O_i)^2 U_{i j} }  " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Why?   The matrix elements <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=U_%7Bi+j%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="U_{i j}" class="latex" /> are nonnegative since <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=U&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="U" class="latex" /> is stochastic.  Thus the sum can only vanish if each term vanishes, meaning that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O_j+%3D+O_i&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="O_j = O_i" class="latex" /> whenever <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=U_%7Bi+j%7D+%5Cne+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="U_{i j} &#92;ne 0" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>To show the sum vanishes, let&#8217;s expand it:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Bccl%7D+%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Csum_%7Bi+%5Cin+X%7D+%28O_j-O_i%29%5E2+U_%7Bi+j%7D+%7D+%26%3D%26+%5Cdisplaystyle%7B+%5Csum_i+%28O_j%5E2+U_%7Bi+j%7D-+2O_j+O_i+U_%7Bi+j%7D+%2BO_i%5E2+U_%7Bi+j%7D%29+%7D++%5C%5C++%5C%5C+%26%3D%26+%5Cdisplaystyle%7B++O_j%5E2%5Csum_i+U_%7Bi+j%7D+-+2O_j+%5Csum_i+O_i+U_%7Bi+j%7D+%2B+%5Csum_i+O_i%5E2+U_%7Bi+j%7D+%7D+%5Cend%7Barray%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;begin{array}{ccl} &#92;displaystyle{ &#92;sum_{i &#92;in X} (O_j-O_i)^2 U_{i j} } &amp;=&amp; &#92;displaystyle{ &#92;sum_i (O_j^2 U_{i j}- 2O_j O_i U_{i j} +O_i^2 U_{i j}) }  &#92;&#92;  &#92;&#92; &amp;=&amp; &#92;displaystyle{  O_j^2&#92;sum_i U_{i j} - 2O_j &#92;sum_i O_i U_{i j} + &#92;sum_i O_i^2 U_{i j} } &#92;end{array} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Now, since (1) and (2) hold for all stochastic states <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpsi&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;psi" class="latex" />, this equals</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7B++O_j%5E2%5Csum_i+U_%7Bi+j%7D+-+2O_j%5E2+%2B+O_j%5E2++%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{  O_j^2&#92;sum_i U_{i j} - 2O_j^2 + O_j^2  } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>But this is zero because <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=U&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="U" class="latex" /> is stochastic, which implies</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csum_i+U_%7Bi+j%7D+%3D+1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;sum_i U_{i j} = 1" class="latex" /></p>
<p>So, we&#8217;re done!</p>

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I&#039;d say the mathematical trick has been around since 1976.  The nascent &lt;i&gt;idea&lt;/i&gt; lurking in this trick is that we can think of a probability distribution as a quantum state if we normalize it in a nonstandard way and promise to only ask about its transition amplitudes to a certain &#039;default&#039; state $latex &#124; 1 \rangle$.    Mathematical tricks often conceal ideas that are too strange for people to say in words.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
More seriously, I think the main issue is that most of the people involved just weren’t that concerned with quantum-to-classical transitions. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yes, that&#039;s one part of it.  But even if we don&#039;t try to describe the &lt;i&gt;same system&lt;/i&gt; both classically and quantumly, there&#039;s also the question of the &lt;i&gt;logical relation&lt;/i&gt; between the classical and quantum descriptions: that&#039;s what I&#039;m especially interested in.  But this is not the sort of question that &#039;practical&#039; people tend to enjoy---perhaps because they can&#039;t imagine what one might do with the answer.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Second, I think that the people who study diffusion-limited reactions, active-to-absorbing phase transitions, directed percolation and the like are generally eager to skip past the first steps of defining the formalism and get to a Lagrangian they can play with. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Right.  For me the murky beginning steps are the most interesting part, because they hint at a relation between quantum mechanics and probability theory that seems a bit different than the &#039;obvious&#039; one, where $latex &#124;\psi(x)&#124;^2$ rather than the wavefunction $latex \psi(x)$ acts like a probability distribution.  I&#039;ve got a bunch of ideas about this that I&#039;ll reveal as soon as I can.]]></description>
