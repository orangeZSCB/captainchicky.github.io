Some people claim to have made big progress in understanding delphinese:

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;http://wakeup-world.com/2011/11/28/the-discovery-of-dolphin-language/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The discovery of dolphin language&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Wake Up World&lt;/i&gt;, 28 November 2011.

This is a fairly disreputable website, featuring articles on &#039;ancient aliens&#039; and &#039;esoteric knowledge&#039;, among other things.  But the article looks interesting enough that I&#039;ll read it tomorrow when I&#039;m more awake.  (I&#039;m about to collapse right now.)]]></description>

I very much enjoyed reading your comment regarding fire - I am reminded every year at this time how divorced we are as a culture from the actuality of fire.  My family heats our home with wood, and in the fall and winter, keeping up the fire becomes very naturally a main focus of our day.  I often run into conflict with others who just set a thermostat and don&#039;t give their comfort another thought.  No, I can&#039;t go to an impromptu dinner and movie, someone has to get home and feed the fire.  No, we can&#039;t come for a weekend visit, someone has to be home to tend the fire. Our connection with our home is strong and the rhythm of our lives changes naturally with the seasons.  I find it very rewarding.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/10/31/major-transitions-in-evolution/#comment-9397&quot;&gt;Martin Buchert&lt;/a&gt;.

I&#039;ve become sort of a fire theorist (incl. psychopathologist) out of despair with the Late Homo S Sapiens&#039; performance at the open fire place out in the wild. The symptoms go from virtual coprophagia (burning plastic while grilling würstel) to basic fire-fuel process illiteracy (sitting in smoke, yet prohibiting tobacco smoking). It&#039;s not just the stupid, it&#039;s the denial of investing intelligence and taste in the maintenance of fire: The consumer mindset combined with compulsive throwaway disorder (into the fire) often manifests itself paradigamtically at the camp fire, ending in smoking debris and a cold dark wannabe tepee. One amazing thing is the vicious circle of stupidity: Folks can&#039;t do fire for they&#039;ve never seen a real fire burn for they can&#039;t maintain one and so don&#039;t even notice when it works.

Never ever has civilization been that dependent on fire - yet they have no idea of it. 

So, my theory is: The prime revolution of mankind was usage of fire.

It&#039;s this exosomatic source of energy that discerns us from other animals. Plus, methinks the basic place / thing / process where we devoloped much of our intelligence (social and technological) is the open fireplace.

Alas some time during Bronze Age, with the invention of the hotplate, intelligence turned into madness...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In favour of language amongst dolphins and whales we have observations:

1) Two whales meet and exchange calls.  Amongst the calls are quotations from the characteristic song of a third whale, known to both of the other two.  This is evidence for &#039;names&#039; and &#039;gossip&#039; although not definitive

2) Two pairs of juvenile male dolphins meet and have a fight.  The next day the losing pair gather together four more juvenile males and beat up the pair who originally won.  The next day the original winners turn up with about a dozen friends ... This is evidence for language and war

Unfortunately I don&#039;t remember the original sources where I came across either of these observations :(]]></description>

John,

of course you&#039;ve got the topology dead on re the &quot;root&quot; of the tree.  Interestingly, endosymbiosis (for the non-biologists here, that&#039;s the generally accepted theory accounting for independent genomes within the mitochondria of all eukaryotic cells and within the chloroplasts of plant cells) is only one manifestation of Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT).  Sensu latu, HGT is a phenomenon that complicates (and confounds) cladistics, particularly at the base of the terrestrial tree of life in somewhat the same way that quantum effects confound Newtonian mechanics at micro scales. 

I&#039;m a little out of date on this topic, but you may be interested to read Woese 2000 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/97/15/8392.short&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&quot;Interpreting the universal phylogenetic tree&quot;&lt;/a&gt; and particularly the section &quot;When is a tree not a tree?&quot; from Woese 2004 &lt;a href=&quot;//cs.calstatela.edu/~wiki/images/4/44/A_New_Biology_for_a_New_Century.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;A New Biology for a New Century&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>

I&#039;ve not read Wells&#039; book, but we have an increasingly clear understanding that &lt;i&gt;Homo sapiens&#039;&lt;/i&gt; revolutionary potency as an environmental engineer predates the domestication of plant species by many tens of thousands of years. Probably our earliest manifestation as an ecological force at regional to continental scales was when we began to structure ecosystems to our benefit via intentionally kindled fire.

Some key voices here are Bill Cronon (UW Madison) and Steve Pyne (ASU).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think that in Lenton and Watson&#039;s list, the last item should realy be the &quot;rise of agriculture&quot; instead of the &quot;rise of humanity&quot;.

in his last book, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Pandoras-Seed-Unforeseen-Cost-Civilization/dp/1400062152&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pandora&#039;s Seed&lt;/a&gt;, Spencer Wells argues that the fact that we started to act on the environment set in motion several feedback effects that really changed our life, and ultimately the world, for good.

I am almost done reading it, and i have to say that i agree with him. If we were still hunters gatherers we would be still very much humans (perhaps even more so) and still use language a lot, but we wouldn&#039;t have altered our own environment and we wouldn&#039;t be facing either Apocalypse, Retreat or Revolution. We would just be the better hunters on the planet.]]></description>
