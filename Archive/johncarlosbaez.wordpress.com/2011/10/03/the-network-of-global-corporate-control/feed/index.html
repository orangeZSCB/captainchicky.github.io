					<description><![CDATA[There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-physics-arxiv-blog/5e1dd9d1642&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;interesting new results&lt;/a&gt; on the size of the shadow banking system. The reference paper is &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.2130&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

As this related &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.slashdot.org/story/13/09/17/1820207/true-size-of-the-shadow-banking-system-revealed-spoiler-humongous&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;slashdot article&lt;/a&gt; puts it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;By this new measure, the shadow banking system has grown dramatically since the financial crisis and was worth over $100 trillion in 2012, significantly more than had been thought and more even than the GDP of the entire planet. Nothing to worry about, then.&quot;

					<description><![CDATA[Yes... yes... very interesting! But the menu (model) is not the food (outcomes) if I dare to say so to such an esteemed group of model builders and critics of model builders. The model is not the reality. How does one, or the collective we, take the resulting facts (that can reasonably be assumed to be correct from the model), and then ask &#039;So what does what is now known really mean?&#039;  A few bloggers danced around this question, but no one actually asked the question, and certainly no one answered it.  Let me please restate my question and also attempt as AN EXAMPLE ONLY my attempt at answering it. 
Q: What does the global ownership and control model results as described tell us and what does that mean to individuals, governments and corporations?
A1: To me as an individual I think it means I am a very long way from controlling decisions others are making which indirectly and in the long term will probably directly affect my well being or the well being of my son. Maybe I should look for more local investments which have more understandable dynamics where I at least have some control - like my large very successful local credit union.  
A2. From a government&#039;s perspective there may well be a lot of holes in our tax collection sieve. What to do? Daaah!  Let&#039;s get on with it - Let&#039;s spend the money and do the work to stop the  leaks. Oh and while we are at analysis - lets also look at ways of making government policy more productive for people and corporations! A3. What does this mean for corporations... well clearly it means very little... after all we are all part of the feeding chain... are we not?  Seriously... this study illustrates to me that since our corporations especially our banking enterprises are so integrated globally that perhaps we should find or create a global mechanism or frameworks for globally governing all kinds of financial intermediaries - even credit unions. Not just Basel  IV? Yes.. maybe something that just doesn&#039;t control financial institutions but actually helps to plan and direct them ( a light - but not invisible hand) ... and in that way helps them maximize shareholder value... while also respecting and contributing to their broader communities.
Sorry.. If I&#039;d had more time I could have been more brief!

					<description><![CDATA[Your directed network model could be extended in its level of detail.  For instance, companies could be strongly connected such as the connection between a corporate parent and a fully owned subsidiary, or it could be a more weak connection, such as that between a parent and its minority ownership in an LLC.

Further, the connections themselves, while they could be governed by legal rules as described above, they could also represent accounting rules and/or tax law.  For example, a parent corporation can import losses from some types of subsidiaries but not others.

In fact, you could add two additional elements to your directed network which would be very helpful.  First the element of time would be added to allow for changes in the network structure.  Second the element of &quot;events&quot; which provides a set of rules for the effect of a given set of events.

With all of these above, one can model the legal and financial life of a multinational corporation.]]></description>

Well, 10 lines above you wrote that number of 1000 is important. What happened between those posts that numbers does not count?]]></description>

You ask what can be done to make things better....

Perhaps building tools for government regulators would help.  

Many of them don&#039;t do the day to day case and code work and so can&#039;t follow a verbal discussion of a complicated cases.  Visual tools would help and may even be useful in court.]]></description>

The important information is not public and you will not be able to get most of it.  If you own shares in a company you have a right to it but most companies won&#039;t give it to you anyway unless you own a controlling interest.  Even the IRS can&#039;t get some information despite having subpoena powers.]]></description>
