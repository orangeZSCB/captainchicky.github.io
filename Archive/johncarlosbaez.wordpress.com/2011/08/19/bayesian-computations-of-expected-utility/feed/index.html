					<description><![CDATA[The example of the asteroid donation being &quot;better&quot; than the Somalia donation overlooks the obvious - it is factually stated that $1 will save a child, but as far as can be determined, $1 donated to save us from an asteroid will have no effect whatsoever.

					<description><![CDATA[In my hardware development past, we used to test by taking a small sample of prototypes and subjecting it to varying voltages, temperature, frequency, also known as shmoo testing.  We did this to learn more about the design because we couldn&#039;t the time or money to build with every combination of parts selected from their extremes of their tolerance ranges. We were not trying to develop acceptance criteria for a large population.   Inevitably, we&#039;d find a spot on the shmoo plot where we need to do some work.  At that point, the program manager would ask if we could screen for that point as a production test and we&#039;d have to try and explain the difference between our observed failure rate and what the actual failure rate would be in a large population.    Were we just unlucky and got the few bad eggs in an otherwise healthy population or did we just test the cream of the crop and the rest of it should be sent to the recycle bin.

After searching a bit, we found literature on a relationship between an observed failure rate in a small test population and the potential failure rate in a much larger population at a given confidence level.  To compare, to an 80% confidence level, the observed failure rate of 25% on a sample of 4 meant that the actual failure rate of fertilizer A on a big orchard could be as low as 2.6% or as high as 68%, while the observed failure rate of 33% on a sample of 36 meant that the actual failure rate of fertilizer B on a big orchard could be as low as 23% or as high as 45%.   It was a useful tool to use to explain how hard it is to &quot;test in&quot; quality as opposed to design it in.

What we started with was an old Bureau of Standards article with graphs we extrapolated on from the 50s, but it turned out that it was based on beta probability distributions and we could duplicate it with the betainv() function in excel 

Gamma	=	(Confidence + 1.0) / 2

Pmin(Gamma,Sample Size, Percent Defective) = 1 - betainv(Gamma, Sample size  * ( 1 - Percent Defective) + 1, Sample Size * Percent Defective)

Pmax(Gamma,Sample Size, Percent Defective) = betainv(Gamma, Sample size * Percent Defective + 1, Sample Size * (1 - Percent Defective))]]></description>

I&#039;m at least as interested in knowing what happens to the trees if we use no fertilizer at all.  That is, don&#039;t guess a fresh prior ignoring our history, but use all the experience available! This includes the fact that misuse of fertilizer can kill an otherwise healthy tree.

While we can argue about details of the model, I think the point is that the posterior expected utility and the sample performance may be topologically distinct statistics, given some prior --- that is, they are separated by a mapping to permutations.  This sort of feature we&#039;d not expect to disappear under generic perturbations!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Though I probably shouldn&#039;t, I am going to quickly respond to the question of which fertilizer to buy.  The question of &quot;which product, with its inherent risk and payoff, do you chose?&quot; is the same process an investment company will go through in introducing a new customer to its various investment products.  At an investment firm, they simply ask what your &quot;risk aversion&quot; is, that is, how comfortable are you with risk.  As an individual investor with excess cash lying around, your &quot;risk aversion&quot; is just a taste or preference.  Perhaps you are one to &quot;eat a lot of risk&quot;, perhaps not and there is no sense in doing a calculation, though the bayesian approach might be more appealing to assess what the buyer will chose as it takes into account their beliefs, or better put, their preferences.

Now, if you are a business and you are buying the fertilizer as an input to your company (perhaps you are a food company), then a calculation makes a bit more sense, though perhaps not much.  For instance, the more tested fertilizer would appeal to the company that has made precise promises as to its production this year.  Despite the fact that there seems to be a potentially lower yield, they could simply buy more land and plant more things and hit the gross yield with a very accurately projected profit margin.  Again, however, this is in contrast to a company which has made no promises and is interested in taking a risk on getting a higher profit margin.  It is the same thing as the individual investor.  It will come down to the tastes of the owner of the company.]]></description>

$545/life, really? I&#039;d have thought that they can do much better. At the current wholesale prices, you can buy 2000 calories worth of sugar for $0.40, or 2000 calories worth of corn for as low as $0.16 (and these are considered record breaking, never-before-seen prices. Ten years ago the same quantity of calories would&#039;ve cost you one quarter of that money.) Preventing famine seems much cheaper than $545/life.]]></description>

Umm, I hope you mean with the greater potential of &lt;i&gt;preventing&lt;/i&gt; a catastrophic outcome.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
But, at the same time, there’s probably a lower limit on the price per life saved for any such interventions still available, and it is rather high (anything sufficiently deadly would’ve been addressed by a government of at least one developed country by now). I’m pretty sure that it’s way higher than $1/life. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Just to be 100% clear: the &quot;$1/life&quot; figure in my example was never intended to be &lt;i&gt;realistic&lt;/i&gt;.  VillageReach, a charity strongly recommended by GiveWell, is estimated to save &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.beguide.org/villagereach.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;one child&#039;s life per $545 spent&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
And yes, I know that I’m still missing the point of the blog post. :)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It&#039;s only called &quot;missing the point&quot; if you failed to see what I was trying to say.  If you just feel like talking about something else, that&#039;s fine!  There are lots of interesting issues to talk about in this general area.  I wish more people would join these conversations... ]]></description>

If there were no complicating factors, I&#039;d prefer the one with greater potential catastrophic outcome. (Taking the extreme limit, it seems self-evident that an intervention which reduces the chance of complete annihilation of human civilization should be preferred over an intervention that only saves some lives, even if the latter is cheaper in terms of $ per life saved.)

But, at the same time, there&#039;s probably a lower limit on the price per life saved for any such interventions still available, and it is rather high (anything sufficiently deadly would&#039;ve been addressed by a government of at least one developed country by now). I&#039;m pretty sure that it&#039;s way higher than $1/life. We already track near-earth asteroids, and we guard our stockpiles of biological weapons, and we have a military that should be able to knock out any dictator who tries to think seriously about nuclear holocaust. The remaining risks are either improbable (Chicxulub redux), expensive to defend against (a 90% mortality flu pandemic), or both (a nearby supernova). 

And yes, I know that I&#039;m still missing the point of the blog post. :)]]></description>
