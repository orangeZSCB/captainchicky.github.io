G.R.L. wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
You started out encouragingly, not forgetting to include the word “peak” in “peak wind power”, but then you did the thing that is, unfortunately, usual in counting a peak gigawatt of coal as equivalent to one of wind. But coal-fired dynamos do a larger fraction of a flat-out year in a year than wind turbines do.

I make out that 100 wind GW as 1/21 of a wedge, not 1/7.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Whoops!  You&#039;re right.  &lt;img src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/emoticons/redface.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;

The Azimuth team didn&#039;t make that mistake in our earlier &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Stabilization+wedges&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;analysis of Pacala and Socolow&#039;s paper&lt;/a&gt;.  There we summarized their discussion of wind as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Replacing 700 gigawatts of coal-fired power plants by 2000 gigawatts of peak wind power. Wind power is intermittent: Pacala and Socolow estimate that the ‘peak’ capacity (the amount you get under ideal circumstances) is about 3 times the ‘baseload’ capacity (the amount you can count on). So, to save a gigatonne of carbon per year by replacing 700 gigawatts of coal-fired power plants, we need roughly 2000 gigawatts of peak wind power. Wind power was growing at about 30% per year when they wrote their paper, and it had reached a world total of 40 gigawatts. So, getting to 2000 gigawatts would mean multiplying the world production of wind power by a factor of 50.

The wind turbines would ‘occupy’ about 30 million hectares, or about 30-45 square meters per person — some on land and some offshore. But because windmills are widely spaced, land with windmills can have multiple uses. To increase something by a factor of 50 in 50 years, it’s enough to maintain an annual growth rate of slightly more than 8%.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Then we said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
As mentioned, to use wind power to reduce our coal burning by 1 gigatonne of carbon per year, we would need to increase the amount of peak wind power worldwide by a factor of 50, starting from its 2004 level. This sounds difficult, but to grow by a factor of 50 over 50 years, wind power would only need to grow at an average annual rate of 8.3%. And according to the Renewables 2010 Global Status Report (page 16), the average annual growth rate over the five-year period from the end of 2004 to 2009 was much higher than this: namely, 27%.

According to the same source, peak wind power capacity reached 159 gigawatts in 2009. So, reaching Pacala and Socolow’s goal of 2000 gigawatts now requires multiplying the world production of wind power by a factor of 12.5. To reach this goal by 2054 now requires an average annual growth rate of only 5.8%.

Regarding Pacala and Socolow’s calculation for wind power: it does not suffice to account for intermittency by equating baseload capacity to one third of nominal peak capacity, one needs to supplement wind farms with e.g. pumped storage systems to account for variabilities such as lulls. See &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Capacity+factor+of+wind+power&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Capacity factor of wind power&lt;/a&gt; for more information.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

 Thanks for catching my slip-up.  I&#039;ll fix it in the blog article!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[John Baez writes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;On the bright side, China is investing a lot in wind power. Their response to the financial crisis of of 2009 included $220 billion investment in renewable energy. Baoding province is now one of the world’s centers for producing wind turbines, and by 2020 China plans to have 100 gigawatts of peak wind power online.

That’s pretty good! Remember our discussion of Pacala and Socolow’s stabilization wedges? We could reduce carbon emissions by one ‘wedge’, that is one gigatonne per year, by switching 700 gigawatts of coal power to wind. The world needs roughly 10 wedges by about 2050 to stay out of trouble.

So, the Chinese alone are doing 1/7 of a wedge of wind power by 2020.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

You started out encouragingly, not forgetting to include the word &quot;peak&quot; in &quot;peak wind power&quot;, but then you did the thing that is, unfortunately, usual in counting a peak gigawatt of coal as equivalent to one of wind.

If this trend continues, we’ll have ghettos of working poor who work in the city but live in the suburbs, while those who live in the city need to be rich enough not to work at all :-)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That reminds me: lots of farmland near Beijing is being built up and then rented or sold illegally, without clear title. Legal housing is too expensive for many people. If this practice were regularized, housing prices would drop... but apparently a lot of government officials don&#039;t want that. For one thing, they&#039;re benefiting from the soaring price of housing.

(I already mentioned this on Google+, but it belongs here too.)

Wow — that’s a lot! Is almost everyone well-off, or is there just one guy who earns a billion a year?

Just to be pedantic, I should emphasize that my Chinese prices of parking lots are the price of buying one, not renting one.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Okay&lt;/i&gt;, I really misunderstood that and thought that is the &lt;i&gt;renting fee&lt;/i&gt;.

We happen to see in Germany similar urbanization as is described by Stewart Brand in &quot;Whole Earth Discipline&quot; (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Recommended+reading&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;recommended reading&lt;/a&gt;), which means that rural areas lose attractiveness, people move to cities and rich people move to the inner cities, which increases housing costs. Munich is the most expensive city in Germany in this regard. You&#039;ll find 3-room apartments with a higher rent than the average income of a German household, and landlords will often only rent to people who can pay that with about 20% of their income (you&#039;ll need to show your paychecks to prove that --- well, the German equivalent of paychecks).

In the outer rims of Munich, Germany, (my neighborhood) a parking lot costs about 400 Euros per year, unless you own a house with one, of course. I don’t know what the average income is in Munich, but suspect that it will be somewhere between 50 000 and 200 000 Euros per year.

I think such an image could have inspired Tolkien to invent the watchtower of Amun Sûl.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I really loved that whole scene set in Amun Sûl (in the book, that is).  I also liked his depiction of the barrow wights.  Tolkien had a great sense of the eerie attraction of old abandoned earthworks.  He must have gotten &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; of his inspiration from Britain.  Once Oz took me to some old sites in Oxfordshire, perhaps including The Devil&#039;s Quoits here:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

In Beijing the average price of a parking lot is 140,000 yuan, which is about $22,000. In Shanghai it’s 150,000 yuan. But in fancy neighborhoods the price can be much higher: for example, up to 800,000 yuan in Beijing!

For comparison, the average salary in Beijing was 36,000 yuan in 2007—and the median is probably much lower...

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the outer rims of Munich, Germany, (my neighborhood) a parking lot costs about 400 Euros per year, unless you own a house with one, of course. I don&#039;t know what the average income is in Munich, but suspect that it will be somewhere between 50 000 and 200 000 Euros per year. (A lot of people who do the not well paid jobs don&#039;t live in Munich but beyond the outer rims).

The car sales in China have caused a record year of earnings for German car companies and a political debate about the ecologic impacts of an industrialization of China. This debate has existed before, but until now it was theory, mostly. Now it is happening.

Here is one of a series of watchtowers near Dunhuang, once a thriving city at the eastern end of the Silk Road. I don’t think this area was such a desert back then...

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I think such an image could have inspired Tolkien to invent the watchtower of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weathertop&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Amun Sûl&lt;/a&gt;. There are of course similar constructs like &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massada&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Massada&lt;/a&gt; in Israel, which - despite being located in a desert - has quite big swimming pools inside (well, bath tubs where dozens of people fit in). (Massada is also fascinating because there are visible remnants of the Roman siege, like the ramp).]]></description>

<p>In Beijing the average price of a parking lot is 140,000 yuan, which is about $22,000. In Shanghai it’s 150,000 yuan. But in fancy neighborhoods the price can be much higher: for example, up to 800,000 yuan in Beijing!</p>
<p>For comparison, the average salary in Beijing was 36,000 yuan in 2007—and the median is probably much lower&#8230;</p>

<p>In the outer rims of Munich, Germany, (my neighborhood) a parking lot costs about 400 Euros per year, unless you own a house with one, of course. I don&#8217;t know what the average income is in Munich, but suspect that it will be somewhere between 50 000 and 200 000 Euros per year. (A lot of people who do the not well paid jobs don&#8217;t live in Munich but beyond the outer rims).</p>
<p>The car sales in China have caused a record year of earnings for German car companies and a political debate about the ecologic impacts of an industrialization of China. This debate has existed before, but until now it was theory, mostly. Now it is happening.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi John Baez.

Long time no see:) I am from Ning Xia Hui Autonomous region. This year, the weather here is really abnormal. It&#039;s too hot and dry in the northern part of it. And last year, there was too much rain fall in its south. In fact, the weather is really abnormal throughout this country. It seems that  doomsday will come next year. 

What is worse, oil has spilled into the sea for about three months and no one take real action to stop it. Yesterday, 5000 tonnes of Cr 6+ was poured into a river, threatening the dwellers in Guangzhou, the capital city of Guangdong.

I have a presentiment that China will become the next SAHARA in the following century. In June, I travelled around the south of Inner Mongolia and its border with Ningxia. In Inner Mongolia, I couldn&#039;t see a piece of grass land that hadn&#039;t been devastated by coal-carrying cars. And I even found some people plant crops on the grass land. A huge area of land in Inner Mongolia had been completely destroyed because many people poured into Mongolia to scrape money from the coal under the ground. Inner Mongolia should be called &#039;The Biggest Coal-Mine In The World&#039; now. I stayed in Hohhot, the capital city of Mongolia, for three days during which there was a sand storm every day and night. I heard that the Biggest Lake in Inner Mongolia is dwindling now. I reckon that the &#039;Grass Land&#039; in Inner Mongolia should be written as a fairy tale in children&#039;s textbooks. 

Yesterday, I visited the place where I was born, a small village on Helan Mountain, near the border with Inner Mongolia where there is a preservation zone for a kind of unique plant, which is locally called &#039;shanto&#039; and some blue goats, which are an endangered species. I remember how beautiful it is when the &#039;shanto&#039; bloom in spring and the mountain was covered by pink. At that time, no one was allowed to mine sands there and all the coal mines were underground. But now they are strip mining from the surface. In fact, there were six mountains leveled by machines. I cannot see any tree of &#039;shanto&#039; there because they had been buried by the ore and stones. Can you imagine how terrible and dusty it is? It is like a HELL!

I remember many different kinds of wild animals I saw on the mountain. But now they become the history of China. To be honest, I cannot find a reason to stop hating the people who came to my hometown to make money.]]></description>
