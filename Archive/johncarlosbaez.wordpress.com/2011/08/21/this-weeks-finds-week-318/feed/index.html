					<description><![CDATA[In Statistics 101 we learn that correlations do not prove causes, and the complete inability to explain the cause of the correlation for the alleged connection between orbital variations and climate is unexplainable. Well actually, it is explainable as being coincidence, since the odds of so very many variations in orbital variations coinciding with climate change is very high. Any &quot;theory&quot; which tries to link these correlations to a cause are bordering on pseudo-science, since these same exact orbital variations also existed for millions of years BEFORE the current Ice Age started up about 4 million years ago.

For a serious and scientifically sound attempt at explaining the current Ice Age, especially the timing, see

Sea ice switch mechanism and glacial-interglacial CO 2 variations, 
by Hezi Gildor and Eli Tziperman

Interesting, they also released another (earlier) paper in which they discussed this sea ice switch mechanism in conjunction with orbital forcing

Sea ice as the glacial cycles&#039; climate switch: Role of seasonal and orbital forcing, by Hezi Gildor and Eli Tziperman

Now while they call it a &quot;forcing&quot; it is more accurately described as a trigger and not a cause, much in the same way that Maunder Minimums can trigger colder weather but do not cause colder weather.]]></description>

A lot of scientists believe that glacial cycles are correlated to the amount of solar radiation received by the Earth at 65&#176;N in July: that&#039;s the yellow curve below.

					<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s a fun puzzle.  Use some arithmetic to analyze these statements:

• The 95,000-year eccentricity cycle arises from a beat between the 23,700-year and 19,000-year precession cycles.

• The 123,000-year eccentricity cycle arises from a beat between the 22,4000-year and 18,000-year precession cycles.

What&#039;s the big difference between these two claims?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am not good at absorbing the math even though I understand it. I always thought that each glacial period started when the earth&#039;s axis was at its greatest obliquity with the northern hemisphere tilting away from the sun during the part of the year the earth was approaching aphelion and leaving it. The northern hemisphere winter would last much longer than the shorter summer at perihelion. This would allow the snow and ice in the north to accumulate to the point that the short summer could not melt it all before the next winter. The albedo of the increasing snow and ice cover would reduce summer melting further. On the flip side, the same thing would not happen in the southern hemisphere because it has more water than the northern hemisphere and water and ocean circulation moderate the air temperature. Here you have eccentricity, obliquity and precession coming together to start an ice age!]]></description>

I don&#039;t think the orbital plane varies significantly over time, but I&#039;ll try to find out as I gradually learn more about this stuff.

I also don&#039;t think interplanetary dust has a significant effect on the Earth&#039;s climate &lt;i&gt;except&lt;/i&gt; perhaps as a source of ice nuclei.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_nucleus&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&#039;Ice nuclei&#039;&lt;/a&gt; are particles in the upper atmosphere on which ice forms.   They play an important part in the formation of clouds.  For a long time the source of most ice nuclei was a mystery.  Meteorites were one favored possibility:

&#8226; E. K. Bigg and J. Giutronrich, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0469%281967%29024%3C0046%3AINPOMM%3E2.0.CO%3B2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ice nucleating properties of meteoric material&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;J.

However, more recently I think most scientists favor &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioprecipitation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;bacteria&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as the source of most ice nuclei.

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/08/21/this-weeks-finds-week-318/#comment-7237&quot;&gt;nad&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks, nad.  I&#039;ll fix that mistake you caught &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/08/21/this-weeks-finds-week-318/#comment-7233&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;in my comment above&lt;/a&gt;.

By the way, it&#039;s sort of fun to &lt;i&gt;prove&lt;/i&gt; these formulas for the semi-major axis $latex a$ and semi-minor axis $latex b$:

$latex a = \frac{1}{2}(r_{\mathrm{max}} + r_{\mathrm{min}})$

$latex b = (r_{\mathrm{max}} r_{\mathrm{min}})^{1/2}$

If you stare at this picture:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ellipse_latus_rectum.PNG&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Ellipse_latus_rectum.PNG/250px-Ellipse_latus_rectum.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

it&#039;s easy to see that the &#039;length&#039; of the ellipse---the distance between its two farthest points---is the sum 

$latex r_{\mathrm{max}} + r_{\mathrm{min}} $

so the semi-major axis is half this:

$latex a = \frac{1}{2}(r_{\mathrm{min}} + r_{\mathrm{max}})$

The semi-minor axis is a bit less obvious, but I figured it out during a bout of insomnia last night.   You can draw an ellipse using two pins and piece of string like this:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mathopenref.com/constellipse1.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.mathopenref.com/images/constructions/constellipse1/step6.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The total length of the string remains constant as you move your pencil tip around the ellipse.  What is the length of the string?  When the pencil lies at the far left point of the ellipse, the length of the string is clearly

$latex r_{\mathrm{min}} + r_{\mathrm{max}} $

When the pencil lies at the &lt;i&gt;top&lt;/i&gt; point of the ellipse, the length of the string is clearly

$latex 2 C $

where $latex C$ is the hypotenuse of a right triangle formed by a focus of the ellipse, the center of the ellipse, and the top point of the ellipse.   So, 

$latex C = \frac{1}{2} (r_{\mathrm{min}} + r_{\mathrm{max}})$

On the other hand, by the Pythagorean theorem, this hypotenuse $latex C$ obeys

$latex A^2 + B^2 = C^2 $

where $latex A$ is the horizontal side of the right triangle, and $latex B$ is the vertical side.  

The vertical side $latex B$ is, by definition, the semi-minor axis!  That&#039;s what we want to know.

The horizontal side $latex A$ is the distance between the focus and the center of the ellipse.  This is half the distance between the two foci.  And if you scratch your head a bit, you&#039;ll see the distance between foci is

$latex r_{\mathrm{max}} - r_{\mathrm{min}}$

so 

$latex A = \frac{1}{2} (r_{\mathrm{max}} - r_{\mathrm{min}}) $

In summary, we know

$latex B^2 = C^2 - A^2 $

and

$latex A = \frac{1}{2} (r_{\mathrm{max}} - r_{\mathrm{min}}) $

and 

$latex C = \frac{1}{2} (r_{\mathrm{min}} + r_{\mathrm{max}})$

so we can conclude

$latex \displaystyle{B^2 =  \frac{(r_{\mathrm{min}} + r_{\mathrm{max}})^2}{4} - \frac{(r_{\mathrm{min}} - r_{\mathrm{max}})^2}{4}   } $

or with a little algebra

$latex B = (r_{\mathrm{max}} r_{\mathrm{min}})^{1/2}$

Remembering that $latex B$ is the semi-minor axis, normally called $latex b$, we conclude

$latex b = (r_{\mathrm{max}} r_{\mathrm{min}})^{1/2}$

The algebra and geometry of ellipses is quite cute; you can see why Apollonius wrote a book on conic sections.  But I still think it&#039;s a kind of miracle that the Greeks had developed all this mathematics &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; Kepler and Newton realized that planets moved in elliptical orbits.  If this math hadn&#039;t been ready, it would have been much harder to guess the laws governing gravity.  And planets only move around stars in elliptical orbits if the dimension of space is 3.]]></description>

<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%28r_%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bmax%7D%7D+%2B+r_%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bmin%7D%7D%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a = &#92;frac{1}{2}(r_{&#92;mathrm{max}} + r_{&#92;mathrm{min}})" class="latex" /></p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b+%3D+%28r_%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bmax%7D%7D+r_%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bmin%7D%7D%29%5E%7B1%2F2%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="b = (r_{&#92;mathrm{max}} r_{&#92;mathrm{min}})^{1/2}" class="latex" /></p>
<p>If you stare at this picture:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ellipse_latus_rectum.PNG" rel="nofollow"><br />
<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Ellipse_latus_rectum.PNG/250px-Ellipse_latus_rectum.PNG" /></a>
</div>
<p>it&#8217;s easy to see that the &#8216;length&#8217; of the ellipse&#8212;the distance between its two farthest points&#8212;is the sum </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r_%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bmax%7D%7D+%2B+r_%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bmin%7D%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r_{&#92;mathrm{max}} + r_{&#92;mathrm{min}} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>so the semi-major axis is half this:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%28r_%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bmin%7D%7D+%2B+r_%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bmax%7D%7D%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="a = &#92;frac{1}{2}(r_{&#92;mathrm{min}} + r_{&#92;mathrm{max}})" class="latex" /></p>
<p>The semi-minor axis is a bit less obvious, but I figured it out during a bout of insomnia last night.   You can draw an ellipse using two pins and piece of string like this:</p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://www.mathopenref.com/constellipse1.html" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.mathopenref.com/images/constructions/constellipse1/step6.png" /></a></div>
<p>The total length of the string remains constant as you move your pencil tip around the ellipse.  What is the length of the string?  When the pencil lies at the far left point of the ellipse, the length of the string is clearly</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r_%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bmin%7D%7D+%2B+r_%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bmax%7D%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r_{&#92;mathrm{min}} + r_{&#92;mathrm{max}} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>When the pencil lies at the <i>top</i> point of the ellipse, the length of the string is clearly</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2+C+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="2 C " class="latex" /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C" class="latex" /> is the hypotenuse of a right triangle formed by a focus of the ellipse, the center of the ellipse, and the top point of the ellipse.   So, </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D+%28r_%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bmin%7D%7D+%2B+r_%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bmax%7D%7D%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C = &#92;frac{1}{2} (r_{&#92;mathrm{min}} + r_{&#92;mathrm{max}})" class="latex" /></p>
<p>On the other hand, by the Pythagorean theorem, this hypotenuse <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C" class="latex" /> obeys</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%5E2+%2B+B%5E2+%3D+C%5E2+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A^2 + B^2 = C^2 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> is the horizontal side of the right triangle, and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B" class="latex" /> is the vertical side.  </p>
<p>The vertical side <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B" class="latex" /> is, by definition, the semi-minor axis!  That&#8217;s what we want to know.</p>
<p>The horizontal side <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> is the distance between the focus and the center of the ellipse.  This is half the distance between the two foci.  And if you scratch your head a bit, you&#8217;ll see the distance between foci is</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r_%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bmax%7D%7D+-+r_%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bmin%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="r_{&#92;mathrm{max}} - r_{&#92;mathrm{min}}" class="latex" /></p>
<p>so </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D+%28r_%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bmax%7D%7D+-+r_%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bmin%7D%7D%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A = &#92;frac{1}{2} (r_{&#92;mathrm{max}} - r_{&#92;mathrm{min}}) " class="latex" /></p>
<p>In summary, we know</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B%5E2+%3D+C%5E2+-+A%5E2+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B^2 = C^2 - A^2 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D+%28r_%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bmax%7D%7D+-+r_%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bmin%7D%7D%29+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="A = &#92;frac{1}{2} (r_{&#92;mathrm{max}} - r_{&#92;mathrm{min}}) " class="latex" /></p>
<p>and </p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D+%28r_%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bmin%7D%7D+%2B+r_%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bmax%7D%7D%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="C = &#92;frac{1}{2} (r_{&#92;mathrm{min}} + r_{&#92;mathrm{max}})" class="latex" /></p>
<p>so we can conclude</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle%7BB%5E2+%3D++%5Cfrac%7B%28r_%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bmin%7D%7D+%2B+r_%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bmax%7D%7D%29%5E2%7D%7B4%7D+-+%5Cfrac%7B%28r_%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bmin%7D%7D+-+r_%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bmax%7D%7D%29%5E2%7D%7B4%7D+++%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;displaystyle{B^2 =  &#92;frac{(r_{&#92;mathrm{min}} + r_{&#92;mathrm{max}})^2}{4} - &#92;frac{(r_{&#92;mathrm{min}} - r_{&#92;mathrm{max}})^2}{4}   } " class="latex" /></p>
<p>or with a little algebra</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B+%3D+%28r_%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bmax%7D%7D+r_%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bmin%7D%7D%29%5E%7B1%2F2%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B = (r_{&#92;mathrm{max}} r_{&#92;mathrm{min}})^{1/2}" class="latex" /></p>
<p>Remembering that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="B" class="latex" /> is the semi-minor axis, normally called <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="b" class="latex" />, we conclude</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b+%3D+%28r_%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bmax%7D%7D+r_%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bmin%7D%7D%29%5E%7B1%2F2%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="b = (r_{&#92;mathrm{max}} r_{&#92;mathrm{min}})^{1/2}" class="latex" /></p>
<p>The algebra and geometry of ellipses is quite cute; you can see why Apollonius wrote a book on conic sections.  But I still think it&#8217;s a kind of miracle that the Greeks had developed all this mathematics <i>before</i> Kepler and Newton realized that planets moved in elliptical orbits.  If this math hadn&#8217;t been ready, it would have been much harder to guess the laws governing gravity.  And planets only move around stars in elliptical orbits if the dimension of space is 3.</p>
