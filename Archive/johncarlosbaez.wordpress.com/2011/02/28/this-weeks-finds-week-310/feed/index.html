I keep pointing to the underlying error in the assumptions of the climate mitigation model.  The purpose of mitigation is to perpetuate an economy that naturally needs ever growing energy use.  

That&#039;s what it is. That&#039;s what it&#039;s always been.  That&#039;s what won&#039;t work at all except to generate hidden liabilities even greater than climate change.  If you &quot;automatically disbelieve&quot; that, consider what happens if we exhaust our affordable energy resources without rebuilding our economy to run on expensive energy...]]></description>

Cosmist... You seem to misunderstand the reasons why scientists believe in trying to project the consequences of natural processes.  It&#039;s because nature is out of our control, and not in any way shape or manner dependent on our theories.  

I grant that given the difficulty you express with the theory suggests even scientists might only have a slim chance of being right.  Finding useful theories, though, is the only option available that would allow us to escape the consequence of walking straight into total disasters.   

To put it into the vernacular, it&#039;s the standard precautionary principle that any wife or mother uses that&#039;s being applied here.   If think you are going to invite more people home for dinner than she thinks she has food to offer, you&#039;ll get a good tongue lashing.   

If you object and just say you&#039;re sure she could find more, and you&#039;re coming with your gang anyway, you&#039;re likely to find a locked or empty home to come to, as she will not be able to help you.]]></description>

Hansen never made a prediction of 2-4 degree temperature rise in the past decade.

After breakfast, I planned to look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://stevengoddard.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/paintimage834.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the link provided&lt;/a&gt; to see what it said.  The idea of Hansen claiming a 2-4 degree increase &lt;i&gt;in one decade&lt;/i&gt; seemed completely at odds with everything I&#039;ve read by him.   For example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/abstract.cgi?id=ha02800o&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;in 1993&lt;/a&gt; Hansen estimated a temperature increase of 3&#177;1&#176;C for a &lt;i&gt;doubling of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere&lt;/i&gt;&#8212;something that&#039;ll take considerably longer than one decade to occur.

Now I&#039;ve had breakfast.  I now see the link points to a newspaper article, not something Hansen wrote.  The article is wrong.  If &#039;the Cosmist&#039; thinks otherwise, he should look at Hansen&#039;s papers, &lt;a href=&quot;http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/authors/jhansen.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;which are publicly available&lt;/a&gt;, and show us where he made this supposed prediction.]]></description>

Please restrain your hyperbole.  For someone who is supposedly rational, you seem quick to speak of &quot;apocalypse&quot; and &quot;shrill&quot; &quot;hysteria&quot; of people with &quot;agendas&quot;.  You will find none of these words in, say, the IPCC report.  And no one is talking about &quot;dismantling industrial civilization&quot;.

As for climate models, they have their limitations, but there isn&#039;t anything dubious about basic energy balance arguments.  It&#039;s certainly possible to argue about regional and local impacts.  But if you&#039;re talking about plain global warming, the general range predicted is based on estimates of climate sensitivity that are consistent across historical observations, paleodata through shallow and deep time, and the entire hierarchy of climate models.

It&#039;s common to assert that climate projections have &quot;repeatedly failed&quot;, but the basic picture has not really changed:  estimates of climate sensitivity 20-30 years ago are similar to modern estimates, and certainly have not been disproven by subsequent observations.

Hansen never made a prediction of 2-4 degree temperature rise in the past decade.  It is easy to find what he did predict in his published research from that time, using GISS Model II.  The newspaper article undoubtedly made a typo, either meaning 0.2-0.4 degrees/decade, or 2-4 degrees/century.]]></description>

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

No?  Your rhetoric&#8212;&quot;climate apocalypse&quot;, &quot;climate doomsayers&quot;&#8212;seems designed to get people heated up, rather than start a calm discussion.  To borrow a phrase from you, I might almost call this rhetoric &quot;shrill&quot;.

Personally I prefer a calmer approach.  This blog is part of the Azimuth Project.  Over on the Azimuth Library, we&#039;ve been trying to compile reliable information on environmental problems and proposed solutions.  If you want scientific reports on climate change, I suggest starting here:

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Reports&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Reports&lt;/a&gt;, Azimuth Library.

If you want to see some seriously considered plans of action, try this:

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Reports&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Plans of action&lt;/a&gt;, Azimuth Library.

You won&#039;t find the word &quot;apocalypse&quot; anywhere in these reports and plans of action, I think&#8212;nor recommendations to &quot;dismantle industrial civilization&quot;.  

It&#039;s true that drastically cutting carbon emissions would require dramatic action.  For a good overview of the order of magnitude of this problem, see:

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Stabilization+wedges&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Stabilization wedges&lt;/a&gt;, Azimuth Library.  

However, these measures are nothing like &quot;dismantling industrial civilization&quot;.  And you&#039;ll note the Gregory Benford, our interviewee here, is suggesting the possibility of less rapid cuts in carbon emissions coupled with temporary measures to cool the Earth.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Is the case for climate apocalypse really so clear?  Everyone admits that the climate system is incredibly complex and difficult to model, yet a lot of otherwise intelligent people seem prepared to dismantle industrial civilization based on these dubious models.  I don&#039;t understand how rational physicists can adopt this position (and of course neither do many eminent physicists, such as Freeman Dyson), but if there are some sources of information that make this clear I would like to read them.

The predictions of the climate doomsayers have failed repeatedly (see for example James Hansen&#039;s prediction in 1988 of a 2-4 degree temperature rise in the past decade: http://stevengoddard.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/paintimage834.jpg ), but despite their failures they seem to be ever more confident and shrill with every new apocalyptic projection.  I don’t have any political agenda here, but to me something about this climate change hysteria doesn’t quite add up -- I fear that those driving it *do* have political agendas and their proposed “solutions” are much worse than the original “problem”!]]></description>

Ah, that&#039;s a better question. 

And it&#039;s good that you added the clause &quot;on the condition that you donate it to a charity of your own choice&quot;, because I was all ready with the answer in case you left that out: I&#039;d have said &quot;I&#039;ll save the money for my retirement&quot;.  Given the shaky state of California&#039;s economy, I don&#039;t trust the U.C. pension system very much anymore.

Since I haven&#039;t ever been in the position to donate lots of money to a charity, I haven&#039;t thought much about your question.  I want to tackle it when I rewrite my will, but I haven&#039;t yet.  So, I don&#039;t have an answer ready.

If you held a gun against my head and forced me to answer without further thought, I&#039;d probably say &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.msf.org/msf/articles/2011/02/month-in-focus---february-2011.cfm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Médecins Sans Frontières&lt;/a&gt;, because I&#039;m pretty risk-averse.  They seem to accomplish what they set out to accomplish, they seem &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.msf.org/msf/articles/2010/08/msf-financial-reports.cfm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;financially transparent&lt;/a&gt;, and I think it&#039;s pretty easy to argue that they&#039;re doing something good (as opposed to squandering money, or doing something actively bad).  

Of course, anyone associated with &lt;i&gt;Less Wrong&lt;/i&gt; would ask if I&#039;m really maximizing expected utility.  Couldn&#039;t a contribution to some place like the Singularity Institute of Artificial Intelligence, despite a lower chance of doing good, actually have a chance to do so much &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; good that it&#039;d pay to send the cash there instead?

And I&#039;d have to say:

1) Yes, there probably are such places, but it would take me a while to find the one that I trusted, and I haven&#039;t put in the work.  When you&#039;re risk-averse and limited in the time you have to make decisions, you tend to put off weighing options that have a very low chance of success but a very high return if they succeed.  This is sensible so I don&#039;t feel bad about it.

2) Just to amplify point 1) a bit: you shouldn&#039;t always maximize expected utility if you only live once.  Expected values &#8212; in other words, averages &#8212; are very important when you make the same small bet over and over again.  When the stakes get higher and you aren&#039;t in a position to repeat the bet over and over, it may be wise to be &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_aversion&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;risk averse&lt;/a&gt;.

3) If you let me put the $100,000 into my retirement account instead of a charity, that&#039;s what I&#039;d do, and I wouldn&#039;t even feel guilty about it.  I actually think that the increased security would free me up to do more risky but potentially very good things! 

Hmm, here&#039;s a better idea:

Could I get someone to create an institute, register it as a charity, and get the institute to hire me?  ]]></description>

<p>Ah, that&#8217;s a better question. </p>
<p>And it&#8217;s good that you added the clause &#8220;on the condition that you donate it to a charity of your own choice&#8221;, because I was all ready with the answer in case you left that out: I&#8217;d have said &#8220;I&#8217;ll save the money for my retirement&#8221;.  Given the shaky state of California&#8217;s economy, I don&#8217;t trust the U.C. pension system very much anymore.</p>
<p>Since I haven&#8217;t ever been in the position to donate lots of money to a charity, I haven&#8217;t thought much about your question.  I want to tackle it when I rewrite my will, but I haven&#8217;t yet.  So, I don&#8217;t have an answer ready.</p>
<p>If you held a gun against my head and forced me to answer without further thought, I&#8217;d probably say <a href="http://www.msf.org/msf/articles/2011/02/month-in-focus---february-2011.cfm" rel="nofollow">Médecins Sans Frontières</a>, because I&#8217;m pretty risk-averse.
