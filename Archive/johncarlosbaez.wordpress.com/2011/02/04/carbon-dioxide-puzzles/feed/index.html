I don&#039;t know how important algal blooms are here.  This article seems relevant:

&#8226; R. A. Feely &lt;i&gt;et al.&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/pubs/outstand/feel1868/text.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The influence of El Niño on the equatorial Pacific contribution to atmospheric CO2 accumulation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;398&lt;/b&gt; (1999) 597–601.

Among other things, the abstract says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The total reduction of the regional sea-to-air CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; flux during the 1991–94 El Niño period is estimated to account for up to one-third of the atmospheric anomaly (the difference between the annual and long-term-average increases in global atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; content) observed over the same period.

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/02/04/carbon-dioxide-puzzles/#comment-3968&quot;&gt;Nathan Urban&lt;/a&gt;.

And another... it seems pretty easy to find all these papers for free:

&#8226; Schimel &lt;i&gt;et al.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/global/pdf/Schimel2001.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Recent patterns and mechanisms of carbon exchange by terrestrial ecosystems&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v414/n6860/abs/414169a0.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;414&lt;/b&gt; (8 November 2001), 169-172.

&lt;blockquote&gt;

Knowledge of carbon exchange between the atmosphere, land and the oceans is important, given that the terrestrial and marine environments are currently absorbing about half of the carbon dioxide that is emitted by fossil-fuel combustion. This carbon uptake is therefore limiting the extent of atmospheric and climatic change, but its long-term nature remains uncertain. Here we provide an overview of the current state of knowledge of global and regional patterns of carbon exchange by terrestrial ecosystems. Atmospheric carbon dioxide and oxygen data confirm that the terrestrial biosphere was largely neutral with respect to net carbon exchange during the 1980s, but became a net carbon sink in the 1990s. This recent sink can be largely attributed to northern extratropical areas, and is roughly split between North America and Eurasia. Tropical land areas, however, were approximately in balance with respect to carbon exchange, implying a carbon sink that offset emissions due to tropical deforestation. The evolution of the terrestrial carbon sink is largely the result of changes in land use over time, such as regrowth on abandoned agricultural land and fire prevention, in addition to responses to environmental changes, such as longer growing seasons, and fertilization by carbon dioxide and nitrogen. Nevertheless, there remain considerable uncertainties as to the magnitude of the sink in different regions and the contribution of different processes.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Again, more good graphs and information!]]></description>

Here&#039;s another:

&#8226; Le Quéré &lt;i&gt;et al.&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;lgmacweb.env.uea.ac.uk/lequere/publi/Le_Quere_et_al_Tellus_2003.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Two decades of ocean CO2 sink and variability&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Tellus&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;55B&lt;/b&gt; (2003), 649–656.

The abstract:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Atmospheric CO2 has increased at a nearly identical average rate of 3.3 and 3.2 Pg C yr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for the
decades of the 1980s and the 1990s, in spite of a large increase in fossil fuel emissions from 5.4 to 6.3 Pg C yr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus, the sum of the ocean and land CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sinks was 1 Pg C yr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; larger in the 1990s than in the 1980s. Here we quantify the ocean and land sinks for these two decades using recent atmospheric inversions and ocean models. The ocean and land sinks are estimated to be, respectively, 0.3 (0.1 to 0.6) and 0.7 (0.4 to 0.9) Pg C yr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; larger in the 1990s than in the 1980s. When variability less than 5 yr is removed, all estimates show a global oceanic sink more or less steadily increasing with time, and a large anomaly in the land sink during 1990–1994. For year-to-year variability, all estimates show 1/3 to 1/2 less variability in the ocean than on land, but the amplitude and phase of the oceanic variability remain poorly determined. A mean oceanic sink of 1.9 Pg C yr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for the 1990s based on O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; observations corrected for ocean outgassing is supported by these estimates, but an uncertainty on the mean value of the order of ±0.7 Pg C yr−1 remains. The difference between the two decades appears to be more robust than the absolute value of either of the two decades.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

(It says O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; there and I don&#039;t think that&#039;s a typo, though I don&#039;t quite understand it &#8212; look at the end of section 4.)

There are also nice graphs here, but the story they tell seems to differ significantly from Le Quéré &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt;&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/02/04/carbon-dioxide-puzzles/#comment-4050&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;more recent paper&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/02/04/carbon-dioxide-puzzles/#comment-3968&quot;&gt;Nathan Urban&lt;/a&gt;.

Renato wants to read the papers Nathan cited, but he doesn&#039;t have access to the journals!  Luckily, some are available for free if you just type the titles into Google and look around.  For example:

&#8226; Le Quéré et al., &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/images/headlines/ngeo_689_aop.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Trends in the sources and sinks of carbon dioxide&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Nature Geoscience&lt;/i&gt;, 2009. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;

Efforts to control climate change require the stabilization of atmospheric CO2 concentrations. This can only be achieved through a drastic reduction of global CO2 emissions. Yet fossil fuel emissions increased by 29% between 2000 and 2008, in conjunction with increased contributions from emerging economies, from the production and international trade of goods and services, and from the use of coal as a fuel source. In contrast, emissions from land-use changes were nearly constant. Between 1959 and 2008, 43% of each year’s CO2 emissions remained in the atmosphere on average; the rest was absorbed by carbon sinks on land and in the oceans. In the past 50 years, the fraction of CO2 emissions that remains in the atmosphere each year has likely increased, from about 40% to 45%, and models suggest that this trend was caused by a decrease in the uptake of CO2 by the carbon sinks in response to climate change and variability. Changes in the CO2 sinks are highly uncertain, but they could have a significant influence on future atmospheric CO2 levels. It is therefore crucial to reduce the uncertainties.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There are some nice graphs in this paper, including figure a, which shows the rate of increase of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration.  This graph is jagged like Renato&#039;s, but different, because it&#039;s based on different data, also provide by NOAA: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We used the global mean data after 1980 and the Mauna Loa data between 1959 and 1980.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There&#039;s a lot of good information here, but they note that it would be good to have more:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Progress has been made in monitoring the trends in the carbon cycle and understanding their drivers. However, major gaps remain, particularly in our ability to link anthropogenic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions to atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration on a year-to-year basis; this creates a multi-year delay and adds uncertainty to our capacity to quantify the effectiveness of climate mitigation policies. To fill this gap, the residual CO2 flux from the sum of all known components of the global CO2 budget needs to be reduced, from its current range of ±2.1 Pg C yr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, to below the uncertainty in global CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, ±0.9 Pg C yr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. If this can be achieved with improvements in models and observing systems, geophysical data could provide constraints on global CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions estimates.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

Oh, that&#039;s easy, the &quot;it&quot; in this case is the physical process you are trying to describe, using the data recorded from it as a guide.  The question of whether it is a statistical process or an overlay of many kinds of unrelated dynamic systems, or a single large scale system with small scale fluctuations.. etc.  That would be important for knowing how to construct your mathematical description of it, wouldn&#039;t it?   

Those two tests described on my drstats.htm page would help answer those questions based on whether the trends visible have flowing change in their continuities, to being developing a case for it being one or another kind of  natural phenomenon creating the data.  

One can make a perfectly good statistical model of a dynamic system, but then it&#039;s largely meaningless isn&#039;t it, due to the mismatch  in kind, right?.]]></description>

I haven&#039;t really done anything except explain what Renato Iturriaga did.  The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; data is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; &#8212; have at it!  

But I&#039;m not sure what you mean by &#039;it&#039;.  The anomaly, I guess.  For that, I think the most exciting thing is its apparent correlation with the &quot;Ni&#241;o-3 SST index&quot;, as shown above.   This is the sea surface temperature in a patch of the ocean fairly close to Hawaii:

<p>I haven&#8217;t really done anything except explain what Renato Iturriaga did.  The CO<sub>2</sub> data is <a href="http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/" rel="nofollow">here</a> &mdash; have at it!  </p>
<p>But I&#8217;m not sure what you mean by &#8216;it&#8217;.  The anomaly, I guess.  For that, I think the most exciting thing is its apparent correlation with the &#8220;Ni&ntilde;o-3 SST index&#8221;, as shown above.   This is the sea surface temperature in a patch of the ocean fairly close to Hawaii:</p>

Thanks, Hank! I&#039;ve almost forgotten about tamino&#039;s great blog (being too thrilled about this one). It&#039;s actually no surprise he tackled similar analysis. There&#039;s a lot to learn from tamino&#039;s statistical data analysis blog posts.]]></description>
