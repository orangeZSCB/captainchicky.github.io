					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/02/10/rnyi-entropy-and-free-energy/#comment-4096&quot;&gt;Blake Stacey&lt;/a&gt;.

I&#039;ve been thinking about all this again in the context of trying to invent final-exam problems for my statistical-physics course (it&#039;ll be a take-home exam...), and I noticed something I believe I missed before. This bit in the &quot;Rényi entropy and free energy&quot; paper caught my attention:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Of course, it is already well-known that the von Neumann entropy is the derivative of $latex -F$ with respect to temperature.  What we see now is that the Rényi entropy is the difference quotient approximating this derivative. Instead of the slope of the tangent line, it is the slope of the secant line.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This seems to be doing the same thing, morally speaking, as Eq. (20) in Bialas and Czyz (arXiv:hep-ph/9909209).

$latex S = H_2 + (H_2 - H_3) + (H_2 - 3H_3 + H_4) + \cdots $

They do a polynomial extrapolation of the sequence $latex \{H_k\}$ down to $latex k = 1$, which sounds like another way of saying to take the collection of secant lines and extrapolate to what the tangent line should be.

This is also reminiscent of something I found while playing around with &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4708&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;higher-order generalizations of mutual information&lt;/a&gt;, where a binomial transform also arose ... but that&#039;s getting beyond the scope even of a take-home exam.]]></description>

Just when I was in the mood for typing up some diagrams (and &lt;i&gt;that&#039;s&lt;/i&gt; not common), the nLab seems to be down.  So I latexed them instead.  In fact, I did this operadic characterization of Shannon entropy in very nearly complete detail.

John: you&#039;re confused because you&#039;re treating $latex \mathbb{R}$ as a poset, whereas I&#039;m treating it as a monoid (viewed as a 1-object category).  So a morphism in $latex \mathbb{R}$ is not an inequality: it&#039;s a real number.]]></description>
