					<description><![CDATA[My proposal for a workshop at Banff in 2013 was turned down, but they invited me to reapply for 2014, and I just did.  

I&#039;ll definitely be holding a special session Fall 2013 Meeting of the AMS Western Section here at U.C. Riverside on Saturday and Sunday, November 2 and 3, 2013.  But more about that later!

Here&#039;s the new proposal.  Wish me luck:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Title of proposal&lt;/b&gt;: Diagrammatic Techniques for Networked Systems.

&lt;b&gt;Type of meeting&lt;/b&gt;: 5 Day Workshop (20 participants).

&lt;b&gt;Overview of the subject area of the workshop&lt;/b&gt;: This workshop is about diagrammatic languages for describing complex networks made of interacting parts, particularly stochastic Petri nets, chemical reaction networks, and Bayesian networks.  While these languages have arisen independently, mathematicians are now able to study them systematically in a unified way, thanks in large part to recent developments in mathematical physics.   Stochastic Petri nets and chemical reaction networks are in fact equivalent formalisms, the first from computer science and the second from chemistry, for describing how collections of entities of various kinds randomly interact and turn into other entities.  Bayesian networks are important in probabilistic reasoning, especially machine learning.  All these formalisms involve graph theory interacting with probability theory in related ways.

&lt;b&gt;Statement of the objectives of the workshop&lt;/b&gt;: Diagrammatic languages for describing complex networks made of interacting parts are important practical tools in many branches of applied mathematics, biology and chemistry.  However, practitioners in different fields often wind up &#039;reinventing the wheel&#039;.  Recently mathematicians have made great progress in formally understanding these languages - but so far, their work has been applied mainly to rather abstruse branches of physics, such as topological quantum field theory.  The workshop will connect mathematicians to chemists and biologists so the mathematicians can better understand the practical problems and the scientists can learn about the new tools that are available for working with stochastic Petri nets, chemical reaction networks, and Bayesian networks.  For example, techniques from quantum field theory have been exploited to give new proofs of the Anderson-Craciun-Kurtz theorem and deficiency zero theorem in chemical reaction network theory, but the limits of these techniques are not yet clear, and only a few researchers in the theory are familiar with these techniques.

&lt;b&gt;Workshop press release&lt;/b&gt;: Scientists have developed many ways to use diagrams to study complex systems made of interacting parts.  The most familiar might be an electrical circuit diagram, but many other kinds of diagrams are used in biology, chemistry, and computer science.   Unfortunately, workers in one field don&#039;t always know what workers in another field have done.  So, it&#039;s up to mathematicians to talk to all these scientists and start thinking about diagrams for complex systems in a unified way.  We&#039;re starting to do this, and the results are interesting: for example, ideas from particle physics can be used to study chemical reactions and population biology!

					<description><![CDATA[I fired off the proposal to BIRS today.  Another person emailed me to express interest in the workshop: Michael Dietze of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.life.illinois.edu/plantbio/People/Faculty/Dietze.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Department of Plant Biology&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  His homepage says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The environmental sciences have progressively found themselves thrust from their humble roots in natural history into the role of detecting, quantifying, and predicting the interactions between humankind and our natural environment. We face a future where there is clear and growing demand for quantitative ecological forecasts with accurate assessments of uncertainty at the local, national, and global level. One of the primary goals of my work is to produce ecological forecasts by combining innovative ecological models with cutting-edge statistical and computational techniques and integrating diverse sources of data across many spatial and temporal scales. Forecasting is not merely an exercise in modern information technology, but requires tackling a number of basic research questions. At the forefront of these is the need to go beyond studying individual sites in isolation in order to understand the generalities across ecological systems. Basic science questions are what ultimately drive my research: how do species coexistence; what are the relative contributions of biotic interactions, abiotic factors, and disturbance in structuring ecosystems; and to what extent are ecosystem dynamics predictable versus determined by individual history and chance events? I am interested in understanding the universal constraints on vegetation dynamics through the integration of cross-site studies and focused field campaigns with cutting-edge models and modern statistical techniques. Overall my research is focused on the interacting roles of environmental heterogeneity, disturbance, and climate change in structuring forest dynamics.

 
Recent projects have focused on forest dynamics in the eastern and central U.S. at the stand, landscape, and regional scales. Past projects have also involved work in Costa Rica, Australia, and the Pacific Northwest. In addition, I am starting work on biofuels that will look at the suitability and sustainability of different biofuel crops, their vulnerability to climate variability, their impacts on carbon storage and the water cycle, and the potential land use/land cover changes of biofuel expansion. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

All this is great!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[* &lt;i&gt;which is only radiatively coupled to its (cosmic) environment&lt;/i&gt;

This is not entirely true. Tidal effects have a major role in the climate system, they provide a good portion of the (mechanical) energy needed for deep turbulent mixing of oceans (the other player is internal waves generated by wind stress, mostly over the southern ocean).

Without this (ill-quantified) deep turbulent mixing, which happens at some continental margins and mid-ocean ridges over rugged bottom features, the MOC (Meridional Overturning Circulation) would eventually stop, or at least slow down to a crawl supported only by geothermal heating at the bottom.

For MOC is &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; a heat engine, it does not convert thermal differences to work (mechanical energy), but it&#039;s the other way around. If different parts of a fluid are heated and cooled at the same gravitational potential (depth/height), that never induces any macroscopic flow whatsoever.

Or, as cooling always happens close to the surface (even if one takes surface waves into account) while some heating goes down to several hundred meters (water is pretty transparent to light, especially in the UV and blue segments of the spectrum), it would provide for a very shallow overturning perhaps, unlike what is observed.

Therefore tidal coupling (and breaking) can&#039;t be dismissed. True, it is only  ~150 GW on average, but it is a pure mechanical energy input, which rearranges heat, salts, nutrients, dissolved oxygen &#038; carbon dioxide in the oceans before dissipating (into minuscule amount of heat).]]></description>

This sounds like a great idea for a workshop, Berényi.  I&#039;m 
very much interested in these ideas, as this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Extremal+principles+in+non-equilibrium+thermodynamics&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;desperate attempt to understand extremal principles in nonequilibrium thermodynamics&lt;/a&gt; shows.

Unfortunately I&#039;m not enough of an expert on these ideas (yet?) to feel confident that BIRS would approve an application by me for a workshop on this topic.  I have a long history of studying diagrammatic techniques in physics, and I&#039;ve been writing a series of &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/networks.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;expository articles about more practical applications of these ideas&lt;/a&gt; for a while now, so that seems like a better bet.

But if someone else organizes a workshop on nonequilibrium thermodynamics, or something like that, I&#039;d love to go!]]></description>

<p>This sounds like a great idea for a workshop, Berényi.  I&#8217;m<br />
very much interested in these ideas, as this <a href="http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Extremal+principles+in+non-equilibrium+thermodynamics" rel="nofollow">desperate attempt to understand extremal principles in nonequilibrium thermodynamics</a> shows.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I&#8217;m not enough of an expert on these ideas (yet?) to feel confident that BIRS would approve an application by me for a workshop on this topic.  I have a long history of studying diagrammatic techniques in physics, and I&#8217;ve been writing a series of <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/networks.html" rel="nofollow">expository articles about more practical applications of these ideas</a> for a while now, so that seems like a better bet.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[There are plenty of things mathematicians could do to promote climate science, providing proper tools to understand non-equilibrium quasi steady state thermodynamic processes in non-linear systems of many degrees of freedom being &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;topmost priority&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.

As I see it, the climate system is obviously a heat engine, which is only radiatively coupled to its (cosmic) environment. Temperature of a tiny fraction of the celestial sphere is 5778 K, while the rest is 2.7 K – those are the relevant heat reservoirs we have, with infinite heat capacity each for all practical purposes. Now, the first thing to understand with a heat engine is its entropy processes. Paltridge had a good start in this direction, but this line of investigation is all but abandoned. It is pretty unfortunate, because the climate engine is mind-bogglingly complicated, therefore an analytic approach (pursued by computational climate models) is &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt; hopeless.

But we have other means to approach such a system, like SOC (Self Organized Criticality), SAD (Sandpile Avalanche Dynamics), fractal geometry, MEPP (Maximum Entropy Production Principle), etc. The common trait is that they do not focus on minute details of the system, but treat it as a whole.

It is far from being clear how to proceed in this direction, nevertheless this is the only track that has a chance to bear fruit. With a non-linear system having an astronomical number of degrees of freedom any other approach is doomed to early failure.

For example it is crystal clear that most of the entropy production happens in the climate system when short wave radiation gets absorbed (either in the atmosphere, at the surface or at some depth in the ocean) and is converted to heat. It is also clear that the amount of flux absorbed depends on the planetary albedo, which is not constant. But it is not clear how MEPP or some related extremum principle could control the overall value of albedo (and also the effective emissivity of the system as seen from outside).

Anyway, the first thing to do is to actually *understand* what’s going on, by actively looking for a logical level on which the system is *understandable*.

BTW, I am pretty sure no one actually understands a computational climate model with its million lines of code, especially if it is not structured properly, not published, not documented and the code base itself is bogus in the first place.

ps. Fractal geometry is mentioned, because distribution of water vapor in the atmosphere is clearly fractal-like (even computer graphics people know that), its fractal dimension generally decreasing poleward. Calculating bulk quantities like reflectivity, absorptivity, emissivity, transmittance, etc. over fractals is not trivial and involves some mathematical insight. Simple gridding, if it is done on a single scale, can be quite misleading.]]></description>
