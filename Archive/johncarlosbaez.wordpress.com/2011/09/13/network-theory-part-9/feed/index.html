I fixed the typo &#039;&#038;uumlbergeek&#039; above (should have been &#252;bergeek), but Blake Stacey had already promoted it to a definition over on Google+:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&#038;uumlbergeek&lt;/i&gt;, noun: 1. A person who has spent so much time dealing with fonts and other typesetting issues that they can parse mistyped TeX or HTML entities in their head. A person you might be happy to have around when you need an obscure question answered, but most decidedly not representative of the general reader population. 2. A person who is so familiar with the ways HTML can be mistyped that they instinctively find jokes about &quot;&#038;uumlbergeeks&quot; funny, cf. those who know Elizabethan slang for syphilis and cuckoldry and find their experience of Shakespeare enhanced thereby.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

Is there any flaw with the following reasoning?

I&#039;m preaching on a soapbox here, trying to get everyone interested in various things.  So, the most important thing is that everyone can read what&#039;s said here.  

If people want a place where everyone can start discussions and use TeX to their heart&#039;s content, yes, the forum is better.  Everyone should &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Forum+help&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;join&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Mathforge/Azimuth/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Azimuth Forum&lt;/a&gt;!  It&#039;s a great place.]]></description>

It probably goes without saying that a discussion forum is better for discussions than a blog. By there nature, blogs are not designed for much more than a single layer of comments with an occasional comment on a comment. Just witness the horrible threading here.

If you want to keep the comments where the article appears, why not post the article to the forum instead? The forum is grossly under used for the value it adds.

A blog is for preaching from a soap box. If you want effective discussions, use a discussion forum.

PS: if someone can read the wiki without installing fonts, they should be able to read the blog without installing fonts. Similarly, if they need to install fonts to read the blog, they&#039;d need to install fonts to read the wiki. I think.]]></description>

Right: this blog here is a better place to talk about blog articles after they&#039;re written.  Splintering the discussion isn&#039;t good.  

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A better solution would be for this blog to adopt itex2mml in order to make it fully compatible with both the Azimuth wiki and the Azimuth blog. Andrew already demonstrated that it works with WordPress, so I’m not sure the hang up. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Perhaps when we last discussed this it seemed a fair number of readers would need to &#039;install fonts&#039; to read the math if we used itex2html?  That would be enough to make me not want to do it, since I don&#039;t want to limit the conversations on the blog to people who can do that sort of stuff.

In general I&#039;d much rather leave software technology to people who like it better than me!  But there&#039;s a catch: for the Azimuth Project, we need a blog that everyone in the world can easily read.
 
The problem is, the world has a small number of &#252;bergeeks who can easily &#039;install fonts&#039;, &#039;choose a text filter&#039; (as required on the n-Category Caf&#233;), and other such things... and these people have little understanding of people who are stuck on lower levels of the technological ladder.  80-90% of internet users &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.mozilla.com/metrics/2011/08/25/do-90-of-people-not-use-ctrlf/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;don&#039;t know how to use control-F to search for words on webpages&lt;/a&gt;.  I&#039;m somewhere in between, so it&#039;s my job to resist the urge to choose the &#039;best&#039; software, when that software isn&#039;t something ordinary folks will use.

But, I&#039;m always willing to keep revisiting these issues and keep optimizing things as times change.  Someday most everyone&#039;s browser will understand MathML.  Is that day now?

Anyway, Peter Morgan easily figured out how to use TeX here, after one misfire.]]></description>

Hi Peter. Another option is to skip discussions on the blog and discuss the articles on the discussion forum.

John probably doesn&#039;t prefer that, but when you have RSS, it is irrelevant where the actual comment appears. The Azimuth forum has a preview feature and the syntax is much closer to latex.

Here is the thread for this blog post:

http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Mathforge/Azimuth/comments.php?DiscussionID=823

A better solution would be for this blog to adopt itex2mml in order to make it fully compatible with both the Azimuth wiki and the Azimuth blog. Andrew already demonstrated that it works with Wordpress, so I&#039;m not sure the hang up. 

If we did that, you could even use the forum to preview a comment and once it renders correctly, copy and paste to the blog if you prefer commenting on the blog.]]></description>
