Hello,

Since you mention Penrose and quasiperiodic patterns I assume that you are possibly aware of perfect (!) dodecahedral quasicrystals found in an Ho-Mg-Zn alloy (see 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ho-Mg-ZnQuasicrystal.jpg ).

By the way, talking as a devils advocate, I admire Twarocks virus tiling, but did anyone calculate the actual (spherical) angles of the tiles on the sphere? They cannot be very Penrose-tile-like, since such a tiling would be mostly planar, given its connectivity as shown for the virus. Thus, they have to be distorted? And another thought: Twarock combines kites and large rhombs, taking tiles from both distinct Penrose tilings that would not match in the plane, but what about the other choice, darts and small rhombs, would they tile a spherical surface, too? I wonder why mathematicians most often still do not look at &quot;less-ideal&quot; cases, there would be an awful amount of discoveries waiting.

Finally, back to pyrite. I found it most interesting that this substace grows in crystals with curved (!) faces. One may think of flattening out the pyritohedron in order to obtain them. See 
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/zaac.200400404/abstract or the corresponding article on http://www.sandforsk.se .

Greetings]]></description>

John, I haven&#039;t read the original references for the forms (5.3.0) and (13.8.0) - for sure if any of these forms were the only one present on the crystals they would for sure be fantastic near perfect regular dodecahedra - but most likely they only appeared as tiny faces modifying crystals of more common forms.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Johan Hjellman sent me an email that&#039;s too interesting to keep to myself.  So, I&#039;ll post it here with a few small improvements.  The most interesting part to me is that the pyrite crystals forming pyritohedra of type 5/3 and 13/8 have also been seen!  The latter would be visually indistinguishable from a regular dodecahedron.

&lt;blockquote&gt;

Hi, I browsed your blog. Interesting and informative stuff.

First comment is that pyrite crystals are not built up of small cubic cells, but the symmetry of the “building block”---the &lt;b&gt;unit cell&lt;/b&gt;---is cubic, Alas, it is OK as an image. Thus, your  sentence “At the molecular level, iron pyrite has little cubic crystal cells” would be better as follows: “At a molecular level, iron pyrite has a unit cell with (of?) cubic symmetry” or similar.

The concept that crystals are built up of polyhedra was introduced by the french mineralogist Rene Just Haüy around 1800 and his images of stacked crystal models became standard in the crystallography parts of the mineralogy books of the 19th c. I was quite surprised and happy to see them on your site in a modern context. Haüy was also heading a small manufacture of real wooden models that were sold from Paris in the first decades of the 19th c. We have a couple in our collection; my attachment shows “structure de dodecahedre pentagonal”, but there are some great collections in Berlin, Vienna, etc comprising several hundred models.

Second comment, as I am not a mathematician, it’s all a bit tricky---anyhow one concept I understood is your discussion on the pentagonal dodecahedra and their relation to Fibonacci numbers. I understand that the numbers are getting closer to the golden ratio, and you mentioned the 3/2 pyritohedron that is even a better approximation to the regular dodecahedron. So I went to a mineralogical classic- Hinte’s &lt;i&gt;Handbuch der Mineralogie&lt;/i&gt; and checked out what Miller indices have actually been observed on pyrite and it turns out that the forms (5.3.0) and (13.8.0) have also been observed.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Johan Kjelmann, who works in the mineral collection at Uppsala Universitet, recently found some interesting crystals made of cobaltite (CoAsS).  They&#039;re from Tunaberg, Sweden.  They&#039;re quite small, but they&#039;re shaped like  pseudoicosahedra!

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
