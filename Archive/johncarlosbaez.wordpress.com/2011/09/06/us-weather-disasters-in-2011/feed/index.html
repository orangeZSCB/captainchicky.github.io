					<description><![CDATA[Prof Baez, I am astounded having to rewind so far back on your posts to the one which fits this comment - your productivity is incredible.

I just realized that a useful characterization of the anthropogenic climate change skepticism movement, is to view it as a sibling to intelligent design, and an emanation of the Bible Belt. Both have clearly much in common, and have started to openly mesh for about a year, apparently. A link here http://bit.ly/ewb4N8 and another there http://bit.ly/ipQoM4 . This does open the question of whether and how to address their common ground in the biblical text, imo, and that&#039;s also why I feel the comment best fits this post of yours.]]></description>

I believe buoyancy is not the main effect due to air humidity. A baseball actually &lt;i&gt;flies&lt;/i&gt; through the air, so there are aerodynamical forces acting upon it --- drag and lift. Both of them are assumed to be proportional to the density of the ambient air. So if the ball is thrown without certain spinning (no lifting force) then it will fly further due to lower drag.

Or maybe the actual reason is that moist balls are heavier so they gain higher kinetic energy during the kick.

But anyway, one should better do a deep search in order to solve the riddle, no doubt there is somewhere a &#039;theory of baseballs&#039;.]]></description>

G.R.L. Cowan, hydrogen-energy fan until ~1996 says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    Fun fact: water vapour is lighter than the air it replaces, and baseballs are reputed to fly better on humid days for this reason.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
        As far as I can see this means baseball fans understand buoyancy backwards. What’s fun about it?]]></description>

The riddle doesn&#039;t specify your starting point.  It doesn&#039;t have to be 1 km from the pole.

In Antartica, you can start $latex 1+1/(2\pi)$ km north of the south pole, travel 1 km south, 1 km east (around a circle of circumference 1 km), and then 1 km north to return to the starting point.  Or, more generally, start $latex 1+1/(2\pi n)$ km north of the south pole, and do n circles.]]></description>

Boris Borcic writes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;... relocating polar bears to the Antarctic won’t damage the following riddle ...

&lt;blockquote&gt;A bear starts south for a kilometer, then turns east for a kilometer, then north for a kilometer, and is at that moment returned to its starting point. What’s the color of the bear ?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Actually it does damage it, in the case where the southbound north-polar bear starts at the north pole and goes 1 km south, because if he or she then wants to turn east, this is &lt;strong&gt;possible&lt;/strong&gt;.

If it&#039;s happening in Antarctica, starting from the circle one mile north of the south pole, that first 1 km makes it &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; possible, being you&#039;re at the pole, to go any direction but north. You cannot go east. There is no east.

Also, as a mere (north) polar bear, you&#039;ll freeze.

Where did the riddle &lt;em&gt;come&lt;/em&gt; from? Um ... from two miles east of the east pole, I suppose, like the practice of referring to relatives of one&#039;s common-law spouse as outlaws.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;Our real choice isn’t whether we control the environment or not — it’s whether we decide to manage the consequences of our activities or to suffer the price for not doing so.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Unfortunately the consequences to be managed or the price to be paid is not necessarily automatically related to &quot;we&quot;. That is the prices to be paid are usually distributed differently. And people perceive differently. 

For example, someone living at an endangered coast line may be more affected than someone who is cheering that his winters are getting warmer. 

Some will even not realize that their suffering may be related to environmental problems. If for example the problems of a reinsurer (eventually due to unexpected climate disasters) initiate an avalanche of financial disasters, then I guess most will not attribute these financial consequences, or at least parts of it, to climate change but eventually come up with all sorts of other explanations (especially if they deny climate change).]]></description>

I know Diamond&#039;s book is controversial.  I know a lot of scholars complain that he&#039;s taken a lot of of other people&#039;s research and fit it together into nice stories while neglecting nuances.  Nonetheless I think anyone interested in why societies collapse needs to read &lt;i&gt;Collapse&lt;/i&gt;.  Then, if you&#039;re serious, read the references!

I hadn&#039;t heard anyone disagree with his claim that the Norse in Greenland refused to fish!  That was a very dramatic part of his chapter about Greenland, so if it&#039;s false, it really hurts his case.  It still might true, though, that the colonies in Greenland died out because they refused to emulate the Inuit.

&lt;blockquote&gt;

I agree.]]></description>
