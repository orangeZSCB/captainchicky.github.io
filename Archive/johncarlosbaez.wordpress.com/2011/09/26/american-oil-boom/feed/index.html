The problem with the Systems Dynamics (LtG=Limits to Growth) models is that they don&#039;t treat the stochastic behavior seriously.  Where do they account for the huge variation in reservoir sizes and the fat tail statistics in rates that we must include to get the quantitative predictions correct?  
IMO, all the nit-picking goes away if we can do the analysis in the correct super-statistical framework.  Coarse-graining is perfectly fine if the statistics act to smear out all the fine-grained detail that averages out in the end. 

Seriously if you want to see where I am going with this, check out my on-line document called &lt;a href=&quot;http://theoilconundrum.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Oil Conundrum&lt;/a&gt;.  This is all worked out as a first pass.

Otherwise, I agree with most of your points.]]></description>

I have always wondered why economists have been so reluctant to develop the work of the founding father of the field, Thomas Malthus.

His observation that unbounded population growth would be exponential is certainly true.

His assumption that unbounded resource growth is linear fails because innovation can result in resources going further.  However, so long as resources are bounded, his conclusion that there will eventually be very unpleasant consequences to population growth still holds.

I have also noticed that advocates of free markets are picky about which bits of Adam Smith&#039;s theories they quote.

It is hard to escape the conclusion that economics is not a science since the criterion for rejecting or accepting theories is political palatability as at least as much as fit to observation.]]></description>

I am not so sure that its oil depletion theory that is the source of murkiness but economic theory. The principle tenet of modern economic theory is an infinite supply of substitutable (energy) resources. Not without costs but essentially infinite. The first serious criticism of this notion I know was by W.S. Jevons. It’s worth a look if you don’t know it:

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Coal_Question&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Coal Question&lt;/a&gt;, Wikipedia.

In 1956 M.K. Hubbert did the same thing for oil. In 1971 Meadows et al generalised the concept with ‘Limits to Growth’ pulling together resource, consumption and pollution.  These ideas have been resoundingly rubbished by the good and great as it seriously undermines our current socio-economic system. Nevertheless recent studies on LtG give it considerable credence. See: 

&#8226; Graham Turner, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.csiro.au/files/files/plje.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;A Comparison of the Limits to Growth with thirty years of reality&lt;/a&gt;, 2008.   

&#8226; Matthew R Simmons, &lt;a href=&quot;http://greatchange.org/ov-simmons,club_of_rome_revisted.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Revising Limits to Growth: Could the Club of Rome been right after all?&lt;/a&gt;, 2000.
 
My concern is that in the general scheme of things climate change might not matter. By the time we face the more extreme consequences---rising sea levels, changes in thermohaline circulation, melting permafrost and continual bought&#039;s of smog, acid rains, hurricanes, tornados, heat waves, cold waves, drought, and floods and so on---we will be close to running out of the resources. By run out I mean a world deficit by many orders of magnitude of most resources needed to satisfy material wealth and structural well-being now expected and demanded by an increasing proportion of the world population. Instead of the assumed infinite supply there will be very limited quantities of oil, natural gas, coal, mineral ores, trees, fish stocks and farmed foods and so on---all the things we need to combat climate change.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The math and statistics that the analysts use is still primitive and it’s hard for me to find a toe-hold anywhere for advocating some better approaches. The entire field is still really applied heuristics instead of applied math.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Not completely---take for example the LtG model and simulation. This based on system dynamics of differential equations. However the approach is rather coarse grained. Not that I think this is wrong but it gives sceptics the opportunity to nit-pick detail which an uncomprehending media love to exploit. An alternative is to use process algebra (a development of pi calculus for example) but the scale of the problem is such with the compute power at our disposal we can only go so far. What might be useful is economic equivalent of the kind of work relating process algebras to differential equations that &lt;a href=&quot;http://lucacardelli.name/Papers/Visualization%20in%20Process%20Algebra%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Systems.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Cardelli&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/79914/SSB09-preliminary.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Phillips&lt;/a&gt; and others have done for biological systems.  

This might provide both an analytic and a mixed level modelling and simulation paradigm that could give clearer less questionable predictions.]]></description>

Oil depletion theory is very murky indeed.  The number of scientists that you will find that actively study this is inconsequential in comparison to the number that study climate science.

I don&#039;t know why this is and its actually one of the reasons that I have been investigating it on my own the last 6 years. I figured I could make some progress in a relatively uncrowded field and find something of interest occasionally. Nothing has really changed in the interim other than people are getting a better intuitive feel for what&#039;s happening. The math and statistics that the analysts use is still primitive and it&#039;s hard for me to find a toe-hold anywhere for advocating some better approaches.   The entire field is still really applied heuristics instead of applied math.

The recent trending arguments are in terms of grades of fossil fuels and what kind of energy returns we can expect without completely ruining the environment.  It really gets murky when you realize the European low-countries used up their peat for fuel centuries ago, according to a recent post on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theoildrum.com/node/8460&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Oil Drum&lt;/a&gt;. The Netherlands was filled with huge peat bogs at one time! What&#039;s in store for us with respect to the tar sands, etc I can only imagine.

Recently I have started branching out more into the climate science area and especially where the domains intersect, particularly CO2 accounting.  Blogs and climate science analysts are a dime a dozen and you can find competing theories at any level of abstraction you can imagine. Getting mathematical discussions going there is brutal; instead of the apathy of peak oil, its more a matter of being able to take the incessant hammering of the skeptics. The climate scientists themselves seem to have become jaded based on the abuse they take. I can see how this happens.  

John, you have it pegged as usual.]]></description>

What upsets me is that fairly respectable people&#8212;people who get interviewed on NPR, at least&#8212; can make such radically different statements about things that&#039;ll have such a huge impact on our future.  In the case of human-caused global warming we have the vast majority of climate scientists who say one thing, and the bloggers and talk radio show hosts who say another, and one can sort of guess who is more likely to be right, even before doing any research oneself.  But in the case of &#039;peak oil&#039; it seems like more of a murky mess.  I will need to dig into these questions more deeply, and that&#039;s annoying: we shouldn&#039;t all need to become experts on this stuff, there&#039;s too much else that needs to be done.
