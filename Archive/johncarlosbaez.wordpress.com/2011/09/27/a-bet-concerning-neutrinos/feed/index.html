One catch: I don&#039;t know how to sail.  And while &#039;learning by doing&#039; is generally my preferred approach, I don&#039;t think crossing the Pacific would be wise for a beginner.

The merchant ship idea has its appeal.  

However, in the end Frederik allowed me one round-trip journey by plane, which is all I need.]]></description>

If you do lose this bet, there is always sailing. It is my preferred way of travel, and there are quite a few nice islands to visit along the way to CA.

I&#039;m told the energy requirements for sailing are quite low. ;-) Something about free wind and all that. Add a bit of solar power for electronics and communication and you have a very low footprint way of getting back and forth to Singapore.

Downside is that it will take 3 or 4 weeks in a non-racing boat for each leg not including stopovers.

You can also travel on merchant ships which are going to make the journey anyway. In this case, the incremental carbon footprint for you as a passenger is quite low.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
How many sandwiches?  A dozen or so.

Yes, that&#039;s better.

&lt;b&gt;Great!&lt;/b&gt;  I&#039;ll announce it now on Google+!

(By the way, using the phrase &quot;or so&quot; immediately labels you as a native German speaker... or perhaps Dutch, too?  Germans always say this.  Not that this is bad!  But I would never say it in this context.  I&#039;d say &quot;or something&quot;.  In fact I can&#039;t think of any context where&#039;d I&#039;d say &quot;or so&quot;.)]]></description>

Perfect. If you don&#039;t want to write it so explicitly, it&#039;s fine for me, because, being both gentlemen, the idea is to honour to the &quot;spirit&quot; of the bet. So I don&#039;t insist upon adding something like &quot;&lt;i&gt;only one roundtrip which would allow John Baez to spend a period of at least one month as a visiting scientist in another institute so he won&#039;t be separated from his wife during this period&lt;/i&gt;&quot; especially because I trust:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
But you see, I’m not so sneaky.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And, after all, if you wouldn&#039;t honour the bet, say to use the roundtrip to do some shopping or sightseeing, it wouldn&#039;t be good for your credibility...

					<description><![CDATA[Okay, here&#039;s a reworded bet:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
This bet concerns whether neutrinos can go faster than light.   John Baez bets they cannot.  Just to make life interesting, Frederik De Roo bets that they can.

At any time before October 2021, either John or Frederik can claim they have won this bet. When that happens, they will try to agree whether it’s &lt;i&gt;true beyond a reasonable doubt&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;false beyond a reasonable doubt&lt;/i&gt;, or &lt;i&gt;uncertain&lt;/i&gt; that neutrinos can (under some conditions) go faster than light.  If they cannot agree, the situation counts as uncertain.

If they decide it’s &lt;i&gt;true&lt;/i&gt;, John is only allowed to take one round-trip airplane trip during one of the next 5 years. John is allowed to choose which year this is. He can make his choice at any time (before 4 years have passed).

 If they decide it’s &lt;i&gt;false&lt;/i&gt;, Frederik has to produce 10 decent Azimuth articles during one of the next 5 years&#8212;where &#039;decent&#039; means &#039;deserving of three thumbs up emoticons on the Azimuth Forum&#039;.  He is allowed to choose which year this is. He can make his choice at any time (before 4 years have passed).

 If they decide it’s &lt;i&gt;uncertain&lt;/i&gt;, they can renegotiate the bet (or just decide not to continue it). 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I&#039;ve decided not to add &#039;between California and Singapore&#039; because there&#039;s a high chance that by 2021 I will have a position at some &lt;i&gt;other&lt;/i&gt; institutions.  All the same issues will still apply.

(Of course I could write &quot;John is only allowed to take one round-trip airplane trip between California and Singapore during one of the next 5 years&quot;, and then take 5 roundtrip flights between various destinations but only one between California and Singapore, and claim to have honored the bet!  But you see, I&#039;m not so sneaky.)

Frederik writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If “publicize” means “visible on Azimuth” ...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I&#039;m planning to publicize this bet as much as possible!  It&#039;s a great way to get people interested in climate change, carbon footprints and the Azimuth Project!   Of course I&#039;ll make it clear that that you&#039;re entering into this bet because of your environmental convictions, not because you actually think neutrinos go faster than light.  That&#039;s why in my current version I added &quot;just to make life interesting&quot;.  If you have a better phrase, please suggest it!

I hope you&#039;d be very happy to get some emails from reporters asking why you wanted to make this bet.  You could then explain to them your ideas about the importance of reducing our carbon footprints.  It would be a great opportunity to get the message out there.]]></description>
