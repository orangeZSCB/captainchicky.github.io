Thanks!   Someday I&#039;d like to visit western Java.   I&#039;ve spent a lot of time in Bali, but in Java I&#039;ve only been to Yogyakarta and nearby attractions like Borodubur and Prambanan:

I&#039;m glad you find my book interesting and hope you&#039;ll find some time to comment and/or pose questions on the blog. And no, I haven&#039;t done all that much traveling, and hardly any field work. As I see it, Anthropology shouldn&#039;t be all that different from physics, where you have room for both experimenters, who do the hands on stuff, and theorists, who try to organize their results and think about what it all might mean. But for most Anthropologists (and Ethnomusicologists) the hands-on stuff (field work) is the be-all and end-all, so mine is definitely an uphill struggle. Not that I wouldn&#039;t have liked to visit all these fascinating places and people, but my life took a different course.

I was commenting on Flowers of Darkness, but have since listened to Liminal, which I like even more. It&#039;s an excellent example of ambient music, where you can just put it in the background of your awareness as you do other things, but when you pay attention you find interesting things to listen to. Has a kind of gamelan type feel that works quite well, very delicate. Not bad, for a physicist, I must say. :-)]]></description>

Bali is paradise; I live in Singapore.  But actually Singapore is a much better-organized and convenient place to live, and I don&#039;t know of a &#039;Bali U.&#039; where I could spend my days doing math research... so perhaps being able to work in Singapore and nip over to paradise for a visit now and then is the best I can hope for.

Wow!  What an interesting book!  It&#039;ll take me a while to absorb what it&#039;s about.  Have you spent time travelling around Indonesia and such places and listening to the music, or is your research mainly from afar?  

I&#039;m glad you enjoyed my music. I should be nice to you: you&#039;re an endangered species!   What did you listen to?  I imagine &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/music/flowers_of_darkness/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Flowers of Darkness&lt;/a&gt; sounds a bit like a blues version of Eno&#039;s &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALvc2ivuxeI&#038;feature=related&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Music for Airports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, though it&#039;s actually a lot more like his album &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQo5aYW8g9M&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Neroli&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  My piece &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/music/liminal/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Liminal&lt;/a&gt; has more of the &#039;aimless major&#039; quality of &lt;i&gt;Music for Airports&lt;/i&gt;, but it&#039;s a lot more chaotic. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It’s occurred to be me that Eno’s piece might be just a bit more mathematical than yours — and I’m wondering why. :-)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

First, I&#039;m a worse musician, and it&#039;s just a hobby, so I tend to throw together pieces when I get the urge, instead of laboring over them as Eno usually does.  Second, math is my day job: I like music because it lets me &lt;i&gt;stop&lt;/i&gt; thinking about math.  But third, my album &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/music/treq_lila/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Treq Lila&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; was composed with the help of a cellular automaton: that&#039;s about as mathematicial as it gets!  But I let the computer do the math, while I tried to make it sound good.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey, John. Looks like you&#039;re living in paradise! 

The map you posted rang a bell as it&#039;s the same one I used in my blog-book. Might interest you, so here&#039;s the link: http://soundingthedepths.blogspot.com/2011/03/chapter-fourteen-mysteries-of-sahul.html

I enjoyed your music, by the way. Reminds me a bit of Brian Eno&#039;s &quot;Music for Airports.&quot; It&#039;s occurred to be me that Eno&#039;s piece might be just  a bit more mathematical than yours -- and I&#039;m wondering why. :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[On our first night in Lombok, Lisa and I met a guy named Han who offered to show us around for a reasonable fee. On Monday he took us up to town of Senaru, on the northern slope of the big volcano called Gunung Rinjani that dominates the island. From there we hiked to two waterfalls.

Here you can see Han and Lisa walking along one of canals that carries cold, clear water down from the volcano&#039;s jungle-covered slopes to the complex irrigation system that waters the terraced farms of Lombok:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/diary/lombok/lombok_canal_1.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It should remind you of the irrigation system on Bali, which I showed you in &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week303.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&quot;week303&quot;&lt;/a&gt;.

Here&#039;s the first waterfall we saw. It bursts spectacularly out of the jungle foliage:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/diary/lombok/lombok_first_waterfall.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

 It&#039;s called Sendang Gila, and it&#039;s a popular tourist attraction because it&#039;s only a 20 minute walk from the village of Senaru. Not too crowded, though.

Getting to the second waterfall was considerably more work. After a bit of steep hiking we had to cross the Bridge of Horrors, shown here:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/diary/lombok/lombok_bridge.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Well, that&#039;s just my own name for it, because I have a bit of acrophobia. It has a railing on one side but not the other---and it has large holes, which reveal its true purpose: it&#039;s an aqueduct! The canal I showed you earlier flows through this bridge across the deadly, fearful chasm below.

After gazing dizzily downwards for a minute---it&#039;s really further down than it looks here---I got a mental grip on myself, repeated the mantra don&#039;t look down, and crossed with no problem.

Here&#039;s the second waterfall we saw in Gunung Rinjani National Park:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/diary/lombok/lombok_second_waterfall_4.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It&#039;s called Tiu Kelep. After crossing the Bridge of Horrors, we had to hike 45 minutes more to reach it. Towards the end we needed to walk through the stream. The most exciting moment was when I slipped, reached out to a large rock to steady myself, and then noticed this rock was covered with insects of a kind I&#039;d never seen before... ants, probably, but red and white, and strangely fuzzy. They sensed my hand and mounted a massive swarming attack. A real Indiana Jones moment.

Little things like this make reaching the final goal that much more delightful.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/diary/lombok/lombok_second_waterfall_3.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Here are some more &#039;artistic&#039; shots of Tiu Kelep. It&#039;s wonderful how this one particular plant thrives under these stressful conditions.  Do you know what it&#039;s called?

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/diary/lombok/lombok_second_waterfall_2.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A bit of amateur anthropology:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/diary/lombok/lombok_wedding_1.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

On Sunday we saw four wedding processions here in Lombok---that&#039;s the day people have them. These processions cap off what sounds like a long and complicated process. First the man and woman agree to get married. Then the man &#039;steals&#039; the woman from her family... they sneak off. Then he agrees to pay the price demanded by her family---though if my understanding of local culture is any guide, some bargaining might be involved. A well-educated woman can cost a lot, because high school and college are not free here, and the woman&#039;s family wants to recoup the money they spent on raising her. Younger, less-educated wives are cheaper.

The grim, ashen-faced fellow at left is the groom. He was on the verge of tears. We never found out why.

Q from &quot;finch wench&quot;: Is the demand for the more mature educated woman higher than for the younger &quot;investments?&quot;

A: Good question!  I don&#039;t really know. Our guide told us that most couples marry at the age of 20-23, and do this in order to &quot;have fun&quot;: in the villages, at least, premarital sex is a serious no-no. This doesn&#039;t suggest a high overall demand for more mature, educated women. But there must be lots of different social strata with different habits. For example, only 15% of the people in Lombok are Balinese, but they&#039;re very wealthy and powerful: the Balinese invaded Lombok some centuries ago and though they&#039;ve been pushed back by the native Sasaks, they&#039;re still play an important role.

(The Balinese are Hindu, the Sasaks are Muslim. I&#039;m sort of bummed that I missed going to the only temple in the world where Hindus and Muslims both worship! That would have been interesting.)

In a wedding procession on Lombok, the bride&#039;s family officially &#039;meets&#039; the groom&#039;s family---though they&#039;ve actually spent the previous evening partying together. So it actually starts as two separate processions, walking toward each other down the street. And each one has a band! Above you can see two guys playing electric guitar---but at left, hard to see, there&#039;s a guy playing keyboard. There&#039;s also a singer, not shown here---and in front of the whole crew, kids gyrate wildly to the deafening music.

All this is a substitute for the more traditional gamelan. We saw one of those at the wedding procession of a more wealthy couple.

Q from Harrison Brown: Is there any attempt by these bands to imitate the traditional gamelan sound? Or is the music they play more Western-influenced?

A: These bands don&#039;t seem to be imitating gamelan music at all. Different bands I heard played in different styles. This particular one sounded a bit like Indian pop music to my uneducated ear. However, there are many styles of Indonesian pop music, as you&#039;d expect from an ethnically diverse country with hundreds or even thousands of islands... and I&#039;m sure they were playing one of these styles.

Later our guide took us to Mataram, the capital of Lombok, and we bought a pirated DVD containing 13 CD&#039;s worth of Sundanese gamelan music for the equivalent of $1.20. I love this Sundanese stuff.

Our guide had a DVD of &quot;pop Sunda&quot;, which is strongly gamelan-influenced music played on modern instruments---somewhat cheesy synthesizers and drum machines, but still fascinating. I was unable to copy it, but now I&#039;m in Ubud and I&#039;ll try to buy some CD&#039;s of this.

Here&#039;s the singer of that band, surrounded by a scrum of motor scooters. On Sundays, these wedding processions bring traffic to a halt in small towns all over Lombok. Even though our driver had been a cabbie in Malaysia---which sounds like the ultimate qualification for fighting through crowds---he gave up and pulled over. So we hopped out and photographed these scenes.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/diary/lombok/lombok_wedding_4.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Here&#039;s the keyboard player for that wedding procession band. What&#039;s cool is that the synthesizer is connected to a sound board and bank of speakers... all on a wheeled cart! The band has its name emblazoned on the front of the cart.

This appears to be typical gear for weddings here on Lombok.]]></description>

<div align="center"><img width="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/math.ucr.edu/home/baez/diary/lombok/lombok_wedding_1.jpg" /></div>
<p>On Sunday we saw four wedding processions here in Lombok&#8212;that&#8217;s the day people have them. These processions cap off what sounds like a long and complicated process. First the man and woman agree to get married. Then the man &#8216;steals&#8217; the woman from her family&#8230; they sneak off. Then he agrees to pay the price demanded by her family&#8212;though if my understanding of local culture is any guide, some bargaining might be involved. A well-educated woman can cost a lot, because high school and college are not free here, and the woman&#8217;s family wants to recoup the money they spent on raising her. Younger, less-educated wives are cheaper.</p>
<p>The grim, ashen-faced fellow at left is the groom. He was on the verge of tears. We never found out why.</p>
<p>Q from &#8220;finch wench&#8221;: Is the demand for the more mature educated woman higher than for the younger &#8220;investments?&#8221;</p>
<p>A: Good question!  I don&#8217;t really know.

I&#039;m greatly enjoying Wallace&#039;s book &lt;i&gt;The Malay Archipelago&lt;/i&gt;.  But there&#039;s certainly no shortage of things that make me notice how sensibilities have changed.  The first thing he does with any interesting bird or mammal is try to shoot it.  He&#039;s very impressed by orangutans---for example, how they keep struggling to climb despite severe gunshot wounds.  Also, he&#039;s convinced that the colonial powers have a parental duty to discipline the natives, for their own benefit.

Of course, people will look back on us and find us equally offensive.]]></description>
