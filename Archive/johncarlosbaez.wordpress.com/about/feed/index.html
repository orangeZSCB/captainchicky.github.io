					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/about/#comment-168616&quot;&gt;Phillip Helbig&lt;/a&gt;.

For the last 5 years my main work on the Azimuth Project has been on &quot;applied category theory&quot;: a project to get category theorists doing more practical things, and to use category theory to develop &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/disruptive-design/tools-for-systems-thinkers-the-6-fundamental-concepts-of-systems-thinking-379cdac3dc6a&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;systems thinking&lt;/a&gt; in a more rigorous way.  This seems to be working well, so let me show off a bit.

There&#039;s now an annual conference and school on Applied Category Theory!   The 2021 school includes two courses that use my work on &lt;a href=&quot;https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/structured/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;&quot;structured cospans&quot;&lt;/a&gt;.   One of them uses structured cospans as part of a software tool that allows one to quickly build models from smaller parts:

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2021/01/02/applied-category-theory-2021-adjoint-school/&quot;&gt;Applied Category Theory 2021 Adjoint School&lt;/a&gt;.

Also, my former student Brendan Fong has teamed up with David Spivak to set up a new institute, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://topos.institute/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Topos Institute&lt;/a&gt;, for work along these lines.  They have $3.1 million in funding so far, but they&#039;re just getting started.

I am not particularly interested in working on AI and AI risks, since so many smart people are already doing that, and I don&#039;t feel I have any special skills in that area.   But it would definitely be good to talk to Tegmark.

After I retire in July, and already starting now, I plan to spend more time explaining math and physics... especially polishing up and packaging the explanations I&#039;ve already written in &lt;i&gt;This Week&#039;s Finds&lt;/i&gt; and course notes.  My attempt to update the FAQ which you&#039;re seeing here on Azimuth, is part of that.  But I actually got pulled into that particular little project because I was trying to understand neutrinos a bit better, to continue my project on &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2020/11/13/octonions-and-the-standard-model/&quot;&gt;octonions and the Standard Model&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just read your Azimuth piece about discounting.  IMO valuation of money may be temporally non-linear but should be integrable, contra Marx and other systems that ban interest. Rates are semiotic signals of the time value of money, something Marx denied. USUALLY people value &#039;a bird in hand&#039; more than &#039;a bird in the bush,&#039; but not always. So the usual thing, as with bonds, is that rates vary directly (or polynomially?) with duration. Best wishes!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There is a practical solution to many of the problems created by Climate Change.
REDUCE SEA-LEVEL RISE BY HALF
Due to increased glacier melting and thermal expansion, the Ocean is rising 3-4 mm per year - equivalent to 300 trillion gallons per year. At the same time, rivers pour hundreds of trillions of gallons of fresh water annually into the Ocean.
For example, the watershed feeding James Bay, connected to Hudson Bay, pours 85 trillion gallons of fresh water into the Ocean per year; and the Columbia River in Oregon adds 65 trillion gallons annually. 
Even with continuing excess glacier melt, diverting 150 trillion gallons of water per year from these two sources will reduce the rate of sea-level rise by half. 
IRRIGATE ARID/SEMI-ARID MIDWEST REGIONS
The water from James Bay can be diverted by canal to irrigate 500,000 sq. kilometers (125 million acre) of arid/semi-arid land stretching from Montana to Texas. The irrigation will approximate 18-24 inches per year of precipitation over the region.
The Columbia River water can likewise be diverted by canal to irrigate the San Joaquin Valley in California (5-10 trillion gallons); and 300,000 sq. kilometers (75 million acres) in the arid part of Northern Nevada and Utah.
FORESTS RECAPTURE ANNUAL U.S. CARBON OUTPUT
The irrigated land in both regions can be used to grow billions of trees. Using half of the combined areas would create 100 million acres of new forests, which would recapture 60-80 tons of carbon per acre, or a total of 6-8 Billion tons per year - more than the total annual carbon output of the U.S.
PROMOTE SMALL FARMS/OPPORTUNITY ZONES
80 million acres (40% of the combined regions) could be set aside to revive small family farming. The remaining 20 million acres could be divided into 3,000  communities (+30 million people) drawing remote employees from tech industries and disadvantaged people who are frightened and sickened by life in decaying cities. The increase in land value of $8-10,000.00 per acre (approx. $2 Trillion) will more than offset the cost of building the canals.

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a lover of science and technology who caught the social service bug at sixteen. Now I&#039;m a yogi currently working on curating the knowledge of different wisdom traditions. I&#039;m a devotee of the Renaissance and it&#039;s championing of art and music, of what is abstractly beautiful. So my question is how can we protect the subtle assets of our world? I miss the world science fiction foretold in the Sixties and peaking with positivity of TNG. After fifty years I need to be able to be able to present to my friends and family what is going on in the world. I know children that I want to have a good shot of thriving and prosperity. 
I also serve as an organizer among the tetration and hyperoperations community. I specialize in iterated smooth functions $latex f^n(x) $, which is more general than Arnold&#039;s measure preserving definition of dynamics. A main focus has been working on the question, &quot;do maps in general have flows?&quot;, with application to the hyperoperators. 
My applied category question is given $latex f(g(x)) $ being associated with the integer and set partitions through Faa Di Bruno&#039;s formula, it is easy to demonstrate the association of $latex f^n(x) $ to total partitions (Stanley), hierarchies(Flajolet) and Schroeder&#039;s Fourth Problem.
Question - given the connection between set partitions and total partitions (not proved here), and the relationship of total partitions to Classification Theory, can the laws of physics be viewed as a classification engine? R. Aldrovandi and L. P. Freitas, Continuous iteration of dynamical maps, J. Math. Phys. 39, 5324 (1998) discuss the flow of dynamics through channels of greater and greater detail.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Prof Baez

since you both work in math but also are concerned with the environment (Azimuth project) I thought that a new book may interest you and perhaps others in this blog too

editions-b42.com

It is a product of the collaboration of an artist an architect and a historian of science. It is connected with efforts to adress issues related to the environmental change, but it is also an exploration of new representations of space and time. It seems to me that there is interesting mathematical content in their work (although they are not using expicitely the mathematical concepts that are more readily available in mathematicians).

I also add some video related to this work
