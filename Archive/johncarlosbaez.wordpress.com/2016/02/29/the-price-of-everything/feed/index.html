One can also add a discount factor for time, besides distance.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07975   (thats by a UCB emereti prof, one of whose students had something to do with measuring the universe and got a noble price for it---there&#039;s a related theory (at least to me) from France -&#039;scale relativity&#039;) .

since richard posner was mentioned, here is his son

radicalmarkets.com  or https://radicalmarkets.com   (i have a similar (simple) theory except mine is pretty much the mirror image--some say the left is the mirror image of the right , though if its non-commutative instead one might have wrong is the mirror image of the right, and 2 wrongs make a right--- ahronov-bohm effect ).

there is the Feynman-Wheeler &#039;one electron universe&#039; which supports the idea that the price of universe is same as price of earth--you can make a universe with many electrons, from one with just one electron--they are equivalent.

applied to things like life on earth, one can get into &#039;trolley problems&#039; (Derek Parfit)--do you save the one, or the many?

Research has shown that fundraising during disasters is more effective if you focus on a few people, rather than talk about the large number of people involved.]]></description>

I think I get the point. I am an economist myself and have no trouble understanding Posner&#039;s calculation, or what it can be used for. I also understand that you were just playing with the idea, but I thought it was amusing that an economist had to point out the implications of spacetime.

In defence of Posner, I think he was just trying to show that even by a simplified measure, the collider was too risky.]]></description>

I&#039;m not really using time as measured &#039;from our present perspective on Earth&#039;, I&#039;m really just taking the number that some economist had the guts to provide as an estimate for the total value of the Earth and multiplying it by a crude estimate of the number of similar planets in the observable Universe.   True, that economist came up with his estimate using a process of discounting.  But any economist on any Earth-like planet could do the same; there&#039;s nothing particularly nonrelativistic about this calculation.   Of course, other economists on other Earth-like planets wouldn&#039;t use dollars, and the whole idea of estimating a value for the Earth is pretty strange.   Luckily, this whole blog post of mine was not meant to be taken very seriously.]]></description>

My calculation is based on the standard model of cosmology, which takes general relativity into account.   But I don&#039;t discount distance: doing that says that the value of distant things decreases exponentially with their distance.  That would make some sense if we were talking about the value of the universe &lt;em&gt;to us here on Earth&lt;/em&gt;.   But I wasn&#039;t doing that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Is your calculation a Newtonian one, which does not apply to a Einsteinian Universe? You discount time, but shouldn&#039;t you also discount distance (since time is just another dimension)? I guess you end up with a figure for the entire Universe close to that of Earth.]]></description>
