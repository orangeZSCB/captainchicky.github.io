So regarding area, apparently this image:

&lt;a href=&quot;http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/files/2016/03/Figure3_0301.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/files/2016/03/Figure3_0301.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

shows that &quot;February 2016 sea ice extent was the lowest in the satellite record at 14.22 million square kilometers (5.48 million square miles). The linear rate of decline for February is now 3.0 percent per decade.&quot; This is from &lt;a href=&quot;https://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;, which is obviously a link whose content will change over time. I haven&#039;t yet found anything about the volume in February.]]></description>

Actually PIOMAS is more complicated. The GRACE gravity data as far as I know are not even involved. PIOMAS is a dynamic ice model that is constrained by the satellite observations including areal coverage and wind in the same way a weather model works. (&quot;data assimilation&quot; is shorthand for an interesting collection of statistical/physical methods)

&lt;a href=&quot;http://psc.apl.uw.edu/research/projects/arctic-sea-ice-volume-anomaly/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;PIOMAS&lt;/a&gt; estimates the Arctic sea ice volume using a satellite that carefully measures variations in the Earth&#039;s gravitational pull.  The 31 January 2016 volume figures are not particularly terrible compared to recent years.  But the general trend is down, down, down, so your point may still be correct:

&lt;img width=&quot;600&quot; src=&quot;http://psc.apl.uw.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/schweiger/ice_volume/BPIOMASIceVolumeAnomalyCurrentV2.1.png&quot; /&gt;

It will be interesting to see what happens in February.  (The graph above, from the PIOMAS website, may keep updating itself.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This means that the Arctic is going to get ever warmer. Then the current bathing glacial thresholds gnaw at said threshold. If the threshold fail, the warm water sink past the threshold, and can quickly dislocate a glacier which previously rested on the ground, well below sea level. This has happened to one of two main outlet glaciers of north-east Greenland (see Science, December 2015).

But Greenland has only that much ice resting below sea level. Antarctica has huge amounts of that, and when it breaks up, within a decade or so, the &quot;surprise&quot; will be immense.

I have a number of essays on the subject on my site, detailing various aspects of that problem.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s another potential factor in addition to the basic temperature. While the estimates from satellites are for the area of ice coverage, in reality it&#039;s a volume of ice. Several experts have said that in previous warm years areas with substantial &quot;depths&quot; of ice melted away before the area refroze with &quot;thinner&quot; ice. So while superficially in previous years the area of ice seemed to &quot;rebound&quot; after the melting season, it&#039;s been reconstituted as thinner ice which requires much less energy to melt away again.]]></description>
