					<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s the most definitive-sounding rumor I&#039;ve heard about other gravitational wave detections at LIGO:

&#8226; Dennis Overbye, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/12/science/ligo-gravitational-waves-black-holes-einstein.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Gravitational waves detected, confirming Einstein’s theory&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;, 11 February 2016.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  Shortly after the September event, LIGO recorded another, weaker signal that was probably also from black holes, the team said. According to Dr. Weiss, there were at least four detections during the first LIGO observing run, which ended in January. The second run will begin this summer. In the fall, another detector, Advanced Virgo, operated by the European Gravitational Observatory in Italy, will start up.

					<description><![CDATA[The rumors are true: LIGO has seen gravitational waves! Based on the details of the signal detected, the LIGO team estimates that 1.3 billion years ago. two black holes spiralled into each other and collided. One was 29 times the mass of the Sun, the other 36 times. When they merged, 3 times the mass of the Sun was converted directly to energy and released as gravitational waves.

For a very short time, this event produced over 10 times more power than all the stars in the Universe!

We knew these things happened. We just weren&#039;t good enough at detecting gravitational waves to see them - until now.

I&#039;ll open comments on this breaking news item so we can all learn more. LIGO now has a page on this event, which is called &lt;b&gt;GW150914&lt;/b&gt; because it was seen on September 14th, 2015:

&#8226; LIGO, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ligo.org/science/Publication-GW150914/index.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Observation of gravitational waves from a binary black hole merger&lt;/a&gt;.

You can see the gravitational waveforms here:

&lt;img src=&quot;https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ca8dpleUAAALI2n.jpg&quot; /&gt;

At left in blue is the wave detected in Livingston, Louisiana. At right in red is the wave detected in Hanford Washington. The detector in Hanford saw the wave 7 milliseconds later, so it must have come from the sky in the Southern hemisphere.

The signals need to be carefully filtered, since there&#039;s a lot of noise.  On the LIGO webpage there&#039;s a windowed Fourier transform of the signals, and this caption:

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ligo.org/science/Publication-GW150914/images/fig-1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
&lt;img width=&quot;650&quot; src=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/ligo_gravitational_wave.png?w=650&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  Figure 1. The gravitational wave event GW150914 observed by the LIGO Hanford (H1, left panel) and LIGO Livingston (L1, right panel) detectors. The two plots show how the gravitational wave strain (see below) produced by the event in each LIGO detector varied as a function of time (in seconds) and frequency (in hertz, or number of wave cycles per second). Both plots show the frequency of GW150914 sweeping sharply upwards, from 35 Hz to about 150 Hz over two tenths of a second. GW150914 arrived first at L1 and then at H1 about seven thousandths of a second later - consistent with the time taken for light, or gravitational waves, to travel between the two detectors.

					<description><![CDATA[The folks at &lt;em&gt;New Scientist&lt;/em&gt; have done some clever investigative journalism to locate the source of the gravitational waves probably detected by LIGO:

&#8226; Joshu Sokol, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newscientist.com/article/2076754-latest-rumour-of-gravitational-waves-is-probably-true-this-time/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Latest rumour of gravitational waves is probably true this time&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;New Scientist&lt;/em&gt;, 8 February 2016.

They write:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  If we had a third detector, we could triangulate the source of the signal. That will be possible later this year, when the VIRGO experiment in Cascina, Italy, comes online. But with only the twin detectors, the best we can do is gesture vaguely toward a region of the sky.
  
  So the LIGO team reaches out to astronomers at 75 observatories around the world, who scan that region for more traditional signals: visible light, gamma rays, even neutrinos. If a gravitational wave event is like the elusive Cheshire cat, then finding these counterparts is like spotting the grin.
  
  Although the results of these searches are not public, whether or not they have taken place is – and so are the coordinates.
  
  &lt;em&gt;New Scientist&lt;/em&gt; focused on searches from the European Southern Observatory, a set of telescopes in Chile that will hunt for the bright flash of light that may accompany a gravitational wave signal. By plotting the locations of these searches, we can infer where and when LIGO’s ears may have been pricked.
  
  We found that the first search began on 17 September, starting in the constellation Dorado and veering across other southern sky constellations (see blue spots on map). LIGO’s observing run officially began the very next morning, but the experiment had spent the previous few weeks collecting data in preparation.
  
  The first rumour of a signal appeared just a week later, to the consternation of team members. If borne out, then the first signal ever seen fell into LIGO’s lap before the experiment officially started.
  
  Two other searches – one around the constellation Aries, the other in the rough vicinity of Hydra – both began on 28 December and continued until the end of the run on 14 January (see red spots on map). The three searches together suggest LIGO may have been unbelievably lucky.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yes, gravitational waves, like electromagnetic ones, are deflected by gravitational fields.

But right now we&#039;ve never seen a gravitational wave.  Or maybe we&#039;ve seen just one: we should know later this week.  So, it&#039;s like we&#039;re astronomers who have never yet managed to see stars or galaxies, and you&#039;re asking about the effect of gravitational lensing on the images of stars and galaxies.

There&#039;s an additional problem, too: while stars and galaxies put out light for a long time, the biggest sources of gravitational radiation (at least among the ones we know about) are brief in duration.

I could make all this a bit more quantitative if I knew 1) the angular deflection caused by the strongest known gravitational lenses, 2) the angular resolution of LIGO, or various planned gravitational wave observatories.

Above you&#039;ll see that 1&#176; is a very optimistic answer for question 2): with good gravitational wave detectors only in Louisiana and Washington, our angular resolution is lousy.  Getting VIRGO or some other detector from from the US up to speed --- making it equally sensitive --- might help a lot.

As for question 1), I don&#039;t know the answer, but online I see some examples of gravitational lensing where the deflection is about 3 arcseconds---that is, about 0.001&#176;.

So, it seems we have quite a way to go!]]></description>
