					<description><![CDATA[I am thinking that there are many research in biotechnology to sequence the genome of plants, for example rice (Syngenta), grapevine (Myriad genetic et al.), wheat (International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium), and so on.

The problem is that there is not a single global database (like the Svalbard Global Seed Vault) of the genome, on almost eternal support (like quartz glass nanotechnology): I am thinking that all the sequences could be stored by Food and Agricolture Organization in an open access database in Svalbard (and in a backup duplicate in another continent), so that each researcher in the world could make de-exintion of plants (to avoid problems like for the wheat, and other plants, in international center of gene plant in Aleppo).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2016/02/13/the-quagga/#comment-77315&quot;&gt;philgorman2014&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_index&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Different measures of diversity&lt;/a&gt; say different things about whether genetic diversity is increased when previously rare combinations of genes are made more common.

One can imagine a project where the original quagga ecosystem was restored.  This could be interesting even if genetic diversity hasn&#039;t been increased much.  According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quagga#Breeding_back_project&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  Introduction of these quagga-like zebras could be part of a comprehensive restoration program including such ongoing efforts as eradication of non-native trees. Quaggas, wildebeest, and ostriches, which occurred together during historical times in a mutually beneficial association, could be kept together in areas where the indigenous vegetation has to be maintained by grazing. In early 2006, the third and fourth generation animals produced by the project were considered looking much like the depictions and preserved specimens of the quagga. This type of selective breeding is called breeding back. The practice is controversial, since the resulting zebras will resemble the quaggas only in external appearance, but will be genetically different. The technology to use recovered DNA for cloning does not exist yet.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Unfortunately, I haven&#039;t heard that the Quagga Project has any intention of setting up a reconstruction of the quagga&#039;s original  ecosystem.

In 1840,  Major Sir William Cornwallis Harris wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  it occurs in interminable herds; and, although never intermixing with its more elegant congeners, it is almost invariably to be found ranging with the white-tailed gnu and with the ostrich, for the society of which bird especially it evinces the most singular predilection.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I&#039;m guessing that a &quot;white-tailed gnu&quot; is a wildebeest.]]></description>

Is the quagga project preserving genetic diversity?  I&#039;d think breeding zebras for particular traits would leave most measures of genetic diversity unchanged.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[These are good research fields.
There are many species in danger of extinction, and it is possible the dna conservation for the future (software and biological); so that these experiments will permit (in the future) to create the extinct species, or plants (seeds or dna databases).
Sometimes there are microorganisms causing extinction, or environmental condition, or wars, so that a de-extinction could be possible in future: we don&#039;t know what will be useful in the future.]]></description>
