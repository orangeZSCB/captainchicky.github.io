Thanks to your example, John, I see that my thinking was incorrect – the two probabilities involved need not be even roughly comparable.

I now think the “right” way to compute the false alarm rate, given that it depends on an assumed background rate b which is itself uncertain, would be as the integral of
  pr{false alarm &#124; b=r} * p(r) dr,
where p is b’s assumed probability density function.

I guess that the people writing and reading such papers have a good sense of when such considerations might make a difference (due e.g. to long tails or sensitive dependencies), and just ignore them otherwise.  (At least, I &lt;em&gt;hope&lt;/em&gt; they don’t ignore them just because they are inconvenient and messy!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The idea that a &quot;nearby&quot; star might be influenced into some cataclysmic response by the energy released in the merger sounds interesting, the question that springs to mind is how stable would its orbit be if it were at a location away from the pair but the same distance from us, or more generally on a hyperbola with 0.4s path difference. These aren&#039;t SMBH so perhaps a binary BH system within a dense globular cluster could produce such configuration.

Of course the idea is crucially dependent on how much energy the star could extract from the wave burst, the luminosity would be enormous at that range but I would guess that any energy absorption would depend on &quot;tidal heating&quot; of the star.]]></description>

Good point!

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  I know the speed of gravitational waves hasn’t been fully established, but it’s unlikely to be faster than x-rays, right?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to general relativity the speed of gravitational waves is exactly the speed of light.  Anyone who doubts general relativity can&#039;t trust the usual interpretation of &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; we see with LIGO.  So, we should assume general relativity is right about the speed of gravitational waves when trying to understand this event: otherwise we are tying one hand behind our back.

In an ordinary type II supernova, formed by a collapsing star, the neutrinos come out before the light.  The reason is that neutrinos move at almost the speed of light in vacuum, while the light needs to penetrate through the body of the collapsing star, repeatedly getting absorbed and re-radiated.

A good example is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SN_1987A&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;supernova 1987a&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  Approximately two to three hours before the visible light from SN 1987A reached Earth, a burst of neutrinos was observed at three separate neutrino observatories. This is likely due to neutrino emission, which occurs simultaneously with core collapse, but preceding the emission of visible light. Transmission of visible light is a slower process that occurs only after the shock wave reaches the stellar surface. At 07:35 UT, Kamiokande II detected 11 antineutrinos; IMB, 8 antineutrinos; and Baksan, 5 antineutrinos; in a burst lasting less than 13 seconds. Approximately three hours earlier, the Mont Blanc liquid scintillator detected a five-neutrino burst, but this is generally not believed to be associated with SN 1987A.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Supernova 1987A is considered a &#039;peculiar&#039; type II supernova: for one thing, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SN_1987A#Missing_neutron_star&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;nobody has yet seen&lt;/a&gt; the neutron star that was expected to form from the collapse!  There are various possible explanations: it might have formed a black hole... or it might even have formed a quark star.]]></description>

Thanks!  That&#039;s interesting.

I was going to correct the title of this blog article again, restoring its original title &quot;Gamma ray burst&quot;, but the beginning of this section calls this event &quot;a weak but significant hard X-ray source with a spectrum that extends into the MeV range&quot;---so they seem to think &quot;hard X-ray source&quot; is a suitable term even though Wikipedia calls photons with energy more than 100 keV &quot;gamma rays&quot;.  They also say:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  For a deconvolution assuming a source position at the northeastern tip of the southern lobe (entry 10 in Table 2), the Comptonized model converges to find a best fit $latex E_{peak}$ of $latex 3.5^{+2:3}_{-1.1}$ MeV.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

where earlier they&#039;d defined $latex E_{peak}$ to be the &quot;peak energy in the spectral energy distribution&quot;.  And they say:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  The fit parameter values are typical for short GRBs [gamma-ray bursts].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

Dark matter, being uncharged, couldn&#039;t be the origin of this flash. I don&#039;t think we really know enough about dark energy to say for sure, but a simple cosmological constant is a pure geometric term and shouldn&#039;t produce any EM flash either.

You might also think about normal matter like a nearby star being disrupted by the GWs, but for this event the GWs would not disrupt a material body even very close to the black holes. The source was ~400 Mpc ~= 1e22 kilometres away, and the peak strain at Earth was 1e-21. The strain falls off like 1/r, so a totally naive estimate would say you need to be only 1000 km from the &quot;source&quot; for the strain to approach 1%, which is well inside the near field where the waves are not linear anyway. I doubt there was any material, dark or not, left hanging about in that area after it was swept clean by a couple of huge black holes zooming about at a large fraction of light speed.]]></description>
