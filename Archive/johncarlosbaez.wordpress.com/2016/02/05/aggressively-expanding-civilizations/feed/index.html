					<description><![CDATA[Over the years I&#8217;ve noticed that grad students tend to want to declare their literature search over way too early. If they don’t find something in the first few places they look, they figure it isn’t there. Alas, they implicitly assume that the world of research is better organized than it is; usually a lot more search is needed.

Seems I’ve just made this mistake myself. Having developed a grabby aliens concept and searched around a bit I figured it must be original. But it turns out that in the last five years physicist &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.boisestate.edu/physics/faculty-and-staff/olson/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;S. Jay&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=n9FcBNUAAAAJ&#038;hl=en&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Olson&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4359&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.05969&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;whole&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01521&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;sequence&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07522&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04125&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;seven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.06329&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;related&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08194&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;papers&lt;/a&gt;, most of which are published, and some which got &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en/article/pgam58/how-long-would-it-take-to-colonize-the-universe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;substantial&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://cqgplus.com/2016/01/27/life-altered-cosmologies/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;media&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22630191-000-the-human-universe-could-we-engineer-the-galaxy/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;attention&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K11gkbGArn8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;at&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2016/02/05/aggressively-expanding-civilizations/&quot;&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/books/edition/Life_3_0/70EzDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&#038;gbpv=0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;time&lt;/a&gt;. (We&#8217;ll change our paper to cite these soon.)

Olson saw that empirical study of aliens gets easier if you focus on the loud (not quiet) aliens, who expand fast and make visible changes, and also if you focus on simple models with only a few free parameters, to fit to the few key datums that we have. Olson variously called these aliens &#8220;aggressively expanding civilizations&#8221;, &#8220;expanding cosmological civilizations&#8221;, &#8220;extragalactic civilizations&#8221;, and &#8220;visible galaxy-spanning civilizations&#8221;. In this post, I&#8217;ll call them &#8220;expansionist&#8221;, intended to include both his and my versions.

Olson showed that if we assume that humanity&#8217;s current date is a plausible expansionist alien origin date, and if we assume a uniform distribution over our percentile rank among such origin dates, then we can estimate two things from data:


from our current date, an overall appearance rate constant, regarding how frequently expansionist aliens appear, and
from the fact that we do not see grabby controlled volumes in our sky, their expansion speed.


Olson only required one more input to estimate the full distribution of such aliens over space and time, and that is an &#8220;appearance rate&#8221; function &lt;em&gt;f(t)&lt;/em&gt;, to multiply by the appearance rate constant, to obtain the rate at which expansionist aliens appear at each time &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt;. Olson tried several different approaches to this function, based on different assumptions about the star formation rate and the rate of local extinction events like supernovae. Different assumptions made only make modest differences to his conclusions.

Our recent analysis of &#8220;grabby aliens&#8221;, done unaware of Olson&#8217;s work, is similar in many ways. We also assume visible long-expanding civilizations, we focus on a very simple model, in our case with three free parameters, and we fit two of them (expansion speed and appearance rate constant) to data in nearly the same way that Olson did.

The key point on which we differ is:


My group uses a simple hard-steps-power-law for the expansionist alien appearance rate function, and estimates the power in that power law from the history of major evolutionary events on Earth.
Using that same power law, we estimate humanity&#8217;s current date to be &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; early, at least if expansionist aliens do not arrive to set an early deadline. Others have estimated modest degrees of earliness, but they have ignored the hard-steps power law. With that included, we are crazy early unless &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; the power is implausibly low, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the minimum habitable star mass is implausibly large.


So we seem to have something to add to Olson&#8217;s thoughtful foundations.]]></description>

This idea is fun, but it has immediate problems.  The biggest prediction would be a very abrupt and somewhat recent change in the observed density of galaxies in the universe -- by a factor of ~10.  Then there is the issue that they should still be radiating their waste heat away somehow -- where is it?  Then there is the issue that genuine voids do have observable consequences -- photons from the Cosmic Microwave Background that pass through a void are cooled ever so slightly, and this effect has indeed been observed in the CMB and correlated with the presence of voids.  There are probably a bunch of other immediate implications, but this is already a pretty deep hole to climb out of.]]></description>

Nice puzzle!  It sounds like your question amounts to: do we know that some the dust in our Galaxy is over a billion years old?

					<description><![CDATA[Supposing a runaway self-replicating probe with the ability to evolve. I think evolutionary &quot;success&quot; would mean using up all available resources as fast as possible to expand the bubble. Less successful variants would be left &quot;eating their dust&quot; (except there wouldn&#039;t be any dust left so they would die off).

(Chuckle) when such a database finally gets shared with our progeny, some of them may have lots of &#039;splainin&#039; to do.

On the bright side, this presents the distant prospect of definitively resolving some of McEnroe&#039;s disputed line calls, and of finally putting the grassy-knoll theory out to pasture (then again the latter would just morph, wouldn&#039;t it).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2016/02/05/aggressively-expanding-civilizations/#comment-77385&quot;&gt;Ray Jones&lt;/a&gt;.

Indeed, I don&#039;t see what&#039;s &#039;anthropocentric&#039; about the idea that some organisms rapidly reproduce, expanding their range until a limiting factor kicks in.

The word &#039;aggressive&#039; is a bit anthropocentric, or at least biased toward the social behavior of certain animals.  So, I would not have chosen that word for what&#039;s being studied here.

&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&#039;Aggression&#039;&lt;/a&gt; usually connotes the pursuit of resources, or a higher position in a social hierarchy, by damaging or threatening to inflict damage on other agents.  So, I would not call the spread of a weed like the morning glory in my back yard &#039;aggressive&#039;.

<p>Indeed, I don&#8217;t see what&#8217;s &#8216;anthropocentric&#8217; about the idea that some organisms rapidly reproduce, expanding their range until a limiting factor kicks in.</p>
<p>The word &#8216;aggressive&#8217; is a bit anthropocentric, or at least biased toward the social behavior of certain animals.  So, I would not have chosen that word for what&#8217;s being studied here.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression" rel="nofollow">&#8216;Aggression&#8217;</a> usually connotes the pursuit of resources, or a higher position in a social hierarchy, by damaging or threatening to inflict damage on other agents.  So, I would not call the spread of a weed like the morning glory in my back yard &#8216;aggressive&#8217;.  Nonetheless it tends to grow rapidly, overwhelming competitors, unless I continually struggle against it.</p>

It is true that &quot;aggressively expanding civilizations&quot; may seem anthropocentric, but if there are a large number of civilizations in our universe, then no matter how wildly divergent they are, there is some probability that a few will resemble us in this regard.  And those are the ones under discussion.  And is it really all that anthropocentric?  What about insect swarms?]]></description>

I think Smolin does address the Darwinian evolution counter-argument, albeit indirectly, as follows. While evolution may well be the most efficient mechanism for producing (say) life forms starting from a planet Earth orbiting a sun, there is no possible reason why evolution would require a galaxy beyond our own, or even a solar system beyond our own. Therefore it seems that, at one scale or another, small fluctuations (say, at the solar system scale) should be more common than large fluctuations (ones that produce entire universes).]]></description>
