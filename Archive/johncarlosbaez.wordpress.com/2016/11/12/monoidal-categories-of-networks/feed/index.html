					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2016/11/12/monoidal-categories-of-networks/#comment-84913&quot;&gt;Bruce Smith&lt;/a&gt;.

I&#039;d already spent at least 10 minutes agonizing about this.  As a mathematician I don&#039;t feel any need for &#039;processes&#039; to take time in the most literal sense of &#039;time&#039;: for example, I think of squaring as a process, so I don&#039;t mind thinking of the function

$latex \begin{array}{rcl} f : \mathbb{R} &#038;\to&#038; \mathbb{R} \\
x &#038; \mapsto &#038; x^2 \end{array}$

as a process.  The real problem, as you say, is that the morphisms in this talk often describe not &#039;processes&#039; so much as &#039;open systems&#039; or &#039;networks&#039;.  Luckily, I can say more in words than cleanly fits on the slides---a slide packed with text is no good.   I&#039;ll try to clarify this issue verbally later.  I&#039;ll also mention that in the classic example of a category, the category of sets, an object is a set and a morphism is a function.

I considered taking out all intuitive hints as to what morphisms might be like, but since this talk is for non-mathematicians---for example, biologists---I think a statement like &quot;Categories are great for describing morphisms of all kinds&quot; would not be very helpful.   At that point in the talk, neither categories nor morphisms have been explained, so this statement reads like &quot;X&#039;s are great for describing Y&#039;s of all kinds&quot;.  Mathematicians have an amazing tolerance for sentences that express relationships between undefined terms, but ordinary people want to know what terms &#039;really mean&#039;.  They&#039;re not so used to the idea that sometimes the meaning is nothing other than the network of relationships between terms.

Once, long ago, when I gave a vaguely similar talk, someone asked me what counts as &#039;process&#039;.  He seemed to want a conceptual analysis or definition of that term, and he was dissatisfied when I refused to give one: I said that ultimately I was just talking about morphisms in a category, and the category axioms are the last word on this subject!

However, in that talk I was really using morphisms to describe processes, like Feynman diagrams or spin foams.  My new schtick is to use them to describe open systems.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[On the 3rd or so slide, you say &quot;Categories are great for describing processes of all kinds.&quot; In this context, by &quot;processes&quot; you just mean &quot;morphisms&quot;. But &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of your categories are being used to describe &quot;actual processes&quot;, at least implicitly (e.g. the time evolution of dynamical systems corresponding to a Petri net). That use of the term &quot;process&quot; (which is only implicit in your slides) has nothing to do with the explicit usage, but is a more natural use of the English word &quot;process&quot;. So this explicit use might be confusing to some people (IMHO).

(I&#039;ve quibbled about that term to you in the past, since morphisms needn&#039;t imply any notion of change or time like &quot;process&quot; implies; IIRC your reason for using it instead of something like &quot;relation&quot; or &quot;connection&quot; was because of the &quot;extra info besides endpoints&quot; a morphism can have.)]]></description>
