					<description><![CDATA[One of my goals is to turn category theory, and even &lt;a&gt;higher category theory&lt;/a&gt;, into a practical tool for science.  For this we need good scientific ideas---but we also need good software.

My friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/jamie.vicary/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Jamie Vicary&lt;/a&gt; has been developing some of this software, and he demonstrated it at the Simons Institute &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2016/11/01/compositionality-workshop/&quot;&gt;workshop on compositionality&lt;/a&gt;.  You can watch his demonstration here:

[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w8t0Ze08l4&#038;w=560&#038;h=315]

But since &lt;i&gt;Globular&lt;/i&gt; runs on a web browser, you can also try it out yourself here:

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;http://globular.science/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Globular&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

You can see his talk slides:

					<description><![CDATA[Here at the Simons Institute &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2016/11/01/compositionality-workshop/&quot;&gt;workshop on compositionality&lt;/a&gt;, my &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2016/11/29/compositionality-in-network-theory/&quot;&gt;talk on network theory&lt;/a&gt; introduced &#039;decorated cospans&#039; as a general model of open systems.  These were invented by Brendan Fong, and are nicely explained in his thesis:

• Brendan Fong, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05382&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Algebra of Open and Interconnected Systems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.  (Blog article &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2016/10/23/open-and-interconnected-systems/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)

But he went further: to understand the &lt;em&gt;externally observable behavior&lt;/em&gt; of an open system we often want to simplify a decorated cospan and get another sort of structure, which he calls a &#039;decorated corelation&#039;.  His talk here explains decorated corelations and what they&#039;re good for:

					<description><![CDATA[Bill Lawvere figured out a way to talk about syntax versus semantics that even mathematicians---well, even category theorists---could understand.  It&#039;s called &#039;functorial semantics&#039;.  But physicists may not enjoy this idea unless they see it at work in physics.  In physics, too, the distinction is important.  But it takes a while to understand.  I hope Prakash Panangaden&#039;s talk at the start of the Simons Institute &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2016/11/01/compositionality-workshop/&quot;&gt;workshop on compositionality&lt;/a&gt; is helpful:

					<description><![CDATA[I gave a talk at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2016/11/01/compositionality-workshop/&quot;&gt;workshop on compositionality&lt;/a&gt; at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing next week.  I spoke about some new work with Blake Pollard.  You can see the slides here:

• John Baez, &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks_compositionality/networks_compositionality.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Compositionality in network theory&lt;/a&gt;, 6 December 2016.

and a video here:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyJP_7ucwWo]
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Abstract.&lt;/strong&gt; To describe systems composed of interacting parts, scientists and engineers draw diagrams of networks: flow charts, Petri nets, electrical circuit diagrams, signal-flow graphs, chemical reaction networks, Feynman diagrams and the like. In principle all these different diagrams fit into a common framework: the mathematics of symmetric monoidal categories. This has been known for some time. However, the details are more challenging, and ultimately more rewarding, than this basic insight. Two complementary approaches are presentations of symmetric monoidal categories using generators and relations (which are more algebraic in flavor) and decorated cospan categories (which are more geometrical). In this talk we focus on the latter.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This talk assumes considerable familiarity with category theory.  For a much gentler talk on the same theme, see:

• &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks_santa_fe/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Monoidal categories of networks&lt;/a&gt;.

  <strong>Abstract.</strong> To describe systems composed of interacting parts, scientists and engineers draw diagrams of networks: flow charts, Petri nets, electrical circuit diagrams, signal-flow graphs, chemical reaction networks, Feynman diagrams and the like. In principle all these different diagrams fit into a common framework: the mathematics of symmetric monoidal categories. This has been known for some time.

Two complementary approaches are presentations of symmetric monoidal categories using generators and relations (which are more algebraic in flavor) and decorated cospan categories (which are more geometrical).

					<description><![CDATA[This looks incredibly exciting! I am a novice and so much new material leaves me wondering as to how or even if I might ever be able contribute something useful. Nonetheless I see how my computational and topological interests lay in compositionality, and I am very excited by what I&#039;m learning here. Perhaps coincidentally and unrelated, yesterday, random abstract work arrived at the unsolved Non-Existent Complex Six Sphere in a paper dedicated to S.S.Chern, Jim Simons and Nigel Hitchin written by Micheal Atiyah.  The connections are fuzzy, I lack some language though I appreciate an ability to array small pieces into complex structures as a logical structure of computation and it appears to me to add high dimensional modularities to &quot;establishing systematic relationships between compositional descriptions complexity.&quot; https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09366]]></description>
