					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2016/05/08/vehicle-to-grid/#comment-79911&quot;&gt;davetweed&lt;/a&gt;.

What I meant, Dave, is that the model you are proposing assumes that EVs when at scale will be used in the same way ICEs are. I understand making that assumption for purposes of simplifying analysis, but the future of widespread EV use, with distributed generation looks little like the present energy system.

Consider Uber, for instance, which charges its customers more for rush hour use.  In order for this all to work, it&#039;s clear that large efficiencies are needed and, so, people need to be encouraged to reduce consumption.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://hypergeometric.wordpress.com/2016/05/01/karl-rabago-at-the-rhode-island-state-legislature/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Karl Ragabo makes the point&lt;/a&gt; (which I just recently learned) that while net metering on residential PV is a nice, simple concept, it rewards customers who are sloppy about electricity use in their homes.  Accordingly, he&#039;s been a champion of separating the generating benefit to the home from the consumption charge, and making these time varying.  So, this applies to the EV case by making recharge of EVs during rush hour comparatively expensive, something which could be automated simply based upon demand. Sure, people can still drive, but they&#039;ll be disincentivized to make it a habit.

The Uber economy is getting people used to the idea of there not being fixed rates on things.]]></description>

By &quot;cartoon model&quot; I meant looking at batteries as an isolated chemical subsystem. In an EV, they are part of a bigger engineered system, with regenerative brakes and, in the case of Plett&#039;s work, filters which both estimate the state of the battery from noisy sensors and estimate what the engine is going to be asked to do next, and adjusting the battery accordingly.]]></description>

&lt;i&gt;&quot;Actually, recharge of automotive batteries in situ is a bit more sophisticated than the cartoon model which derives from our collective experience with, say, laptop batteries.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;

Can you tell me where this &quot;cartoon model&quot; is described?

In the white paper I linked to, the first citation is to battery management approaches that are described in a 5-day classroom course on Hybrid and Electric Vehicle Engineering that I attended a few years ago.  As I wrote in the paper, it is very rare to find diffusion coefficient characteristics on commercial battery specification sheets, even though this kind of information is vital for optimizing battery management schemes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One factor that needs to be considered whenever a plan says &quot;lots of nearby small things will be combined to...&quot; (eg, wind-turbines, solar panels, cars, etc) is if there&#039;s an unfortunate correlation going to happen. In this case that looks like it&#039;s unlikely to happen precisely because the more people are in their cars at any time, the fewer there are at home/work making demands for grid electricity.

					<description><![CDATA[There are also companies that facilitate dispatchable negawatts if your local power company supports them.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negawatt_power

http://www.wired.com/2015/02/ohmconnect/

When they need to reduce demand, they send out email/text notifications so you can turn off/unplug stuff yourself, and they can also reduce turn off or slow down networked devices automatically if they have access to the manufacturer&#039;s API.

In terms of V2G, different battery chemistries tolerate addition cycling in different ways. In particular, NCA, which I think what Toyota and Tesla uses, seems to tolerate cycling well (Page 18 of the pdf linked below). Capacity loss is mostly a function of depth of discharge and battery temperature.

					<description><![CDATA[While Lithium-Ion batteries (the base form of V2G storage) may have economic benefits in specialized scenarios for certain individuals and at certain times, it&#039;s definitely not the case for all.  Other scenarios should rely on local market forces to ensure the correct balance there and then.

The only solutions being publicly advocated today are utility run proposals.  It should be noted that all of these proposals ensure the future is profitable for those utilities but not necessarily for their customers.  The real solution is an open market grid based on instant conditions - a living smart grid.  This would allow grid balance to be negotiated constantly in the same way internet traffic is done for every data packet sent around the world.  Doing so would separate transmission and distribution costs from all load and generation costs, pitting every watt generated as equal to every one used.  In this way, the floating price will cause incentive for only the cheapest solutions to exactly what is needed in all cases.  And the result of that will be many new technologies will emerge in automated demand control first, automated generation second and automated storage to fill the rest.

This is a key point because storage should be the last consideration, not the first.  Not only that but electro-chemical batteries should be the last storage technology considered, not the first.  There are far too many technologies available which, due to utility and energy company caused problems in subsidized economics, investor opinion and regulator thinking, cannot yet enter the market.

The proposal can be found at https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/04/07/the-living-smart-grid/ and as expected, it gets no consideration from anyone who deems the utilities&#039; opinion as justified.  Maybe it&#039;s time that changes.]]></description>

&quot;Obviously it is much more environmentally friendly to transport 40 people in 1 bus than to transport 40 people in 40 cars.&quot; Agree with you, Roger, on both the economic forces pushing to orphan public transport, and that, still, public transport is more environmentally friendly.

The work of Karl Ragabo, formerly of Austin Energy, and now at the Pace Energy and Climate Center, suggests something similar of residential PV energy: If solar owners are compensated via net metering or worse, with net metering that does not return energy generated to them at retail, they are being incentivized to both consume more than they would, had their homes and habits been more energy efficient, and to leave the grid, depriving it of advantages of resiliency, peak load support, and support of their non-solar neighbors which would accrue had they remained. Ragabo&#039;s solution is to separate charges: Compensate for generation but, separately, charge for consumption, potentially at different, time-varying rates. (Economically, it is an attempt to achieve a &lt;em&gt;price of indifference&lt;/em&gt; from both sides.) It&#039;s another example where without coordination the least energy intensive path/least emissions path won&#039;t be tracked.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Gosh, you are finally wandering into my seciality of transport so I don&#039;t have to feel like an ameteur trying to say something interesting about category theory or number theory to an expert :)

I think your assumption that the electric vehicles will be parked has a limited lifespan.  It is true that today most cars are mostly parked.  However it is widelt expected that over 5-10 years, autonomous vehicles will become common place.  The economic analysis suggests that individuals won&#039;t bother to own an autonomous vehicle but that they will hire them wwith an Uber style app.  Thus the electric vehicles will be moving most of the time. http://www.economist.com/news/business/21685459-carmakers-increasingly-fret-their-industry-brink-huge-disruption

However the vehicle to grid idea may still be good.  There are experiments on connecting moving vehicles to the grid using electrical induction. https://www.gov.uk/government/news/off-road-trials-for-electric-highways-technology

So we may end up with better utilisation of vehicles, better utilisation of road space and better utilisation of renewables.  The real  big risk to this utopian vision occurs if people stop using buses and trains in favour of autonomous vehicles. Obviously it is much more environmentally friendly to transport 40 people in 1 bus than to transport 40 people in 40 cars.]]></description>
