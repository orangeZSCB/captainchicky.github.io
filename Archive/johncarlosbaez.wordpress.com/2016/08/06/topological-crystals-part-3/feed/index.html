When I was young, I really wanted to understand &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; about the universe---and especially the most basic, fundamental things.  So, I wanted to start by learning the laws of physics, since these govern everything.  As I went further, I realized that the laws of physics are written in the language of mathematics, so I got interested in that.

I also discovered that profound questions like &quot;what is true?&quot; and &quot;how do we know anything?&quot; led people to develop logic.  Thanks to a book my dad checked out of the public library, I learned that in the 20th century G&#246;del and others proved theorems in logic that put limits on what we can prove.   So I got interested in logic, which nowadays is another branch of mathematics.

Nowadays I feel I know enough math and physics to start thinking about other things, like global warming, biology, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;a general theory of networks&lt;/a&gt;.  But occasionally I want to work on pure math, so I do projects like this one on topological crystals.]]></description>

Good puzzle!  You can work it out yourself using the formulas on page 18 &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/qg-winter2007/w07week05a.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>

Interesting...Tropical mathematics as &quot;low T limit of mathematics&quot;. I will reread your winter 2007 seminar...I had almost forgotten it completely! And what about the high temperature limit?]]></description>

Thanks!  I love it when people catch my typos.

Next time I&#039;ll give tons of examples.  All this was just to define the construction and prove it gives a &quot;crystal&quot; embedded in a vector space.]]></description>

OH, I did not remember that! You have been so prolific than I forgot your QG seminar touching this fascinating topic. What about a p-adic/tropical geometry dictionary? Does it exist if any? It is interesting your comment about tropical math as the &quot;classical&quot; limit of quantum math. Low temperature physics is purely quantum at nature (e.g., see the BEC phase transition!). Tropical mathematics is yet a young branch but I am sure physisics will face with it much more in the near future.]]></description>

You can combine ideas in many ways, but throwing them together at random is rarely opimtal.  Tropical mathematics is really the &#039;classical limit&#039; or &#039;low-temperature limit&#039; of mathematics using complex numbers.  I discussed this in weeks 11, 12 and 13 of my &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/qg-winter2007/qg-winter2007.html#quantization&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Winter 2007 seminar&lt;/a&gt;: you can read the notes.   I also recommend this:

&#8226; Grigori L. Litvinov,  &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/math.GM/0501038&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Maslov dequantization, idempotent and tropical mathematics: a very brief introduction&lt;/a&gt;.

I think this is the most promising way to apply tropical mathematics to physics.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear John. I am excited about the links with tropical geometry. Tropical geometry and non-archimedean mathematics are something I would love to touch at my blog (now paused due to some personal and academical issues). I have enjoyed to see tropical connections with graph theory...

To go beyond: What about tropical spacetime physics or tropical Quantum Mechanics? What about a polycrystalline tropically quantum spacetime?]]></description>
