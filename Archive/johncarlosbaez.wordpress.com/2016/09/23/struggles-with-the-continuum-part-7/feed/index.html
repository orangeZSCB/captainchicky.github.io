Yes, I think the Casimir effect violates the strong energy condition: the vacuum between two conductive plates parallel to the $latex xy$ plane has

$latex \rho = -3 P_x = -3 P_y = P_z &#060; 0$

so

$latex \rho + P_x + P_y + P_z = \frac{2}{3} \rho &#060; 0 $

As you probably know better than me, people have investigated quite a number of energy conditions and tried to determine what good behaviors general relativity has when they hold and what bad behaviors it can have when they fail.  I&#039;m no expert on this, so anyone interested should probably start here:

&#8226; Erik Curiel, &lt;a href=&quot;http://strangebeautiful.com/papers/curiel-primer-energy-conds.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;A primer on energy conditions&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Abstract.&lt;/strong&gt; An energy condition, in the context of a wide class of spacetime theories (including general relativity), is, crudely speaking, a relation one demands the stress-energy tensor of matter satisfy in order to try to capture the idea that &quot;energy should be positive&quot;. The remarkable fact I will discuss in this paper is that such simple, general, almost trivial seeming propositions have profound and far-reaching import for our understanding of the structure of relativistic spacetimes. It is therefore especially surprising when one also learns that we have no clear understanding of the nature of these conditions, what theoretical status they have with respect to fundamental physics, what epistemic status they may have, when we should and should not expect them to be satisfied, and even in many cases how they and their consequences should be interpreted physically. Or so I shall argue, by a detailed analysis of the technical and conceptual character of all the standard conditions used in physics today, including examination of their consequences and the circumstances in which they are believed to be violated.

Doesn&#039;t the Casimir effect (with an appropriate geometry of the conducting surfaces) exhibit a violation of the strong energy condition (and even the Null energy condition)?  Do you have in mind an averaged version of the strong energy condition?]]></description>

This condition

$latex \rho + P_x + P_y + P_z \ge 0,$

when it holds at every point in every coordinate system, is called the &lt;b&gt;strong energy condition&lt;/b&gt;.  Using Einstein&#039;s equations it&#039;s equivalent to saying

$latex R_{\mu \nu} X^\mu X^\nu \ge 0 $

for every timelike vector field $latex X,$ where $latex R_{\mu \nu}$ is the Ricci tensor.  There&#039;s no reason to think it&#039;s violated by dark matter, but it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; violated by &#039;dark energy&#039;, which &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; create a repulsive gravitational field.   &#039;Dark energy&#039;, also known as a &#039;positive cosmological constant&#039;, amounts to having a constant small positive energy density $latex \rho$ throughout space, and an equal but opposite pressure in every direction, making

$latex \rho + P_x + P_y + P_z = \rho - 3 \rho = -2\rho &#060; 0$

The repulsive gravitational field of dark energy is making the universe expand faster and faster!

However, there are other, better singularity theorems that involve energy conditions like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_condition#Dominant_energy_condition&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;dominant energy condition&lt;/a&gt;, which are not violated by dark energy.

So, these days dark energy is generally not considered &#039;exotic matter&#039;, despite what I seem to suggest in this article, and despite the fact that dark energy is &#039;exotic&#039; in the nontechnical sense of being weird.]]></description>

No.  I defined exotic matter:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  This is matter for which
  
  $latex \rho + P_x + P_y + P_z &#060; 0$
  
  at some point, in some coordinate system.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If you look at my formulation of Einstein&#039;s equation you&#039;ll see this is matter that creates a repulsive gravitational field.  Dark matter needs to create an attractive gravitational field or it wouldn&#039;t do what we need it to: help form galaxies and make them spin as fast as observed.]]></description>
