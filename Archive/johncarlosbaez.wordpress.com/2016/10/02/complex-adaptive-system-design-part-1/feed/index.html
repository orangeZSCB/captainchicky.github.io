					<description><![CDATA[Hello Mr. Baez...I&#039;m a first time commenter but long time reader.  Thank you for hosting such an interesting discussion.  That aside, I am an engineer who has a lot of experience in the private side of ecotechnology, specifically, adaptive infrastructure design.  I have to agree with Mr. Witte that the difficulties lie not only in modeling the connections between systems but also in the problems of judgment. Ultimately,  risks can be weighed mathematically as the product of probability and consequence, but while probability may be measured scientifically, the value of a consequence is in the eye of the beholder.  Add the problem of when the consequence will occur and you have an infinity problem - how can you possibly model the consequences for all actors over all time?  At this point, judgment always sneaks in again as you&#039;re forced to select which actors at which time are of interest.  Of course, using judgment isn&#039;t necessarily a bad thing.  It can lead to really excellent results that are basically acceptable to everyone.  The opposite is also certainly true. The question then becomes how do we make better judgments, and I believe the answer lies in an improved understanding of design.  I&#039;ve  found the following site helpful in my own work:  http://www.a-r-t-i-f-i-c-e.net/  Best of luck to you in yours!]]></description>

John wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No, I’m not working for the Coast Guard in any sense. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

If I look at what you wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The CASCADE program seeks expertise in the following areas:
• Search and rescue platforms and modeling
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;They needed an academic mathematician as part of their team: that was one of the program’s requirements. So they asked if I was interested.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In this project, a big part of my job would be to write and publish papers: that’s something I can do. But Metron had other people who would try to create prototypes of software for helping the Coast Guard design search and rescue missions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

then this reads to me as if you are working on concrete problems for the coast guard, That is it seems you are going to help out for example when it comes to conceptional questions, like with respect to certain software solutions etc. So may be from an organisatorial viewpoint this is not directly managed by the coast guard but it seems -by what I understood from what you have written- you are directly tackling problems of the Coast guard.

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is however interesting to see their creed. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yes their Creed is interesting. I don&#039;t really know what the function of this creed is, like wether you have to sign this or not etc.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Most of it sounds reasonable, at least for people who are actually working in the Coast Guard. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

I am not sure, I guess as a soldier this depends largely on how voluntary your commitment to the Coast Guard really was. When I was in teaching in Amherst quite some of the Army students who were unexpectedly and out of a sudden sent to war in Iraq seemed quite desperate and were definitely questioning their decision to get their studies funded by signing an army contract.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Personally I do not ‘cheerfully and willingly obey all lawful orders’, but that’s one reason I’m not in the Coast Guard.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

OK I dont know about the concrete terms and conditions of your commitment, but it is clear that in army projects it is likely that you will in general much easier run into questions which &lt;em&gt;may &lt;/em&gt; challenge your (moral) views and wellbeing than in any civilian commitment.

Especially since the US army has lately been not really purely defensive.

In particular it seems in the fifties/sixties my West (!) and East Berlin based family -including myself- was lucky that it wasn&#039;t &lt;a href=&quot;http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/nukevault/ebb538-Cold-War-Nuclear-Target-List-Declassified-First-Ever/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;nuked out &lt;/a&gt; by the US army with their &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Air_Command&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;strategic air command (SAC):&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The SAC study includes chilling details. According to its authors,  their target priorities and nuclear bombing tactics would expose nearby civilians and “friendly forces and people” to high levels of deadly radioactive fallout.  Moreover, the authors developed a plan for the “systematic destruction” of Soviet bloc urban-industrial targets that specifically and explicitly targeted “population” in all cities, including Beijing, Moscow, Leningrad, East Berlin, and Warsaw.  &lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congratulations on winning the grant John! Am sure working on a concrete problem will be good for your creativity in theoretical models. What i wanted to comment on was your vision of applying the System of Systems approach to design of resilient urban infrastructure. I&#039;m afraid this may be a difficult problem for 2 reasons


Large Spatial scales of natural disasters (earthquake, extreme rainfall, floods, hurricanes) ~10km imply that every single urban system is collectively affected i.e drainage, roads, electricity, gas lines. Moreover, these infrastructure are literally underground and grouped together. So there is a conflict between long range spatial correlations of disasters and short range spatial corrlelation of infrastructure system.
Hysterisis i.e History matters: Stripping away historical infra is a) extremely expensive b) Politically difficult: as coastal property in major cities are often occupied by the wealthy who prefer hard defences that deflect floods away from them towards more vulnerable populations downstream.


The best recent book on the political nature of systems risk due to global warming with extensive case studies of Hurricane sandy, Miami, Bombay, Indonesia etc is &#039;How the world breaks&#039; by Paul and Stan cox

Caught me flat-footed on a favorite book. I&#039;ve got a binder full of slides based on course material.  I don&#039;t think there is any one go-to text on the topic, as it spreads across disciplines like operations research, decision theory, and AI.  I wanted to apply generic inference, based on a book by Pouly and Kohlas but I think it may be suited for someone other than me to figure it out, see 
https://www.amazon.com/Generic-Inference-Unifying-Automated-Reasoning/dp/0470527013

I referenced that in a report I was involved in, and if you want to look at that. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270279820_META_Adaptive_Reflective_Robust_Workflow_ARRoW

Based on the premise that everything is a graph, how to use the graph to automatically solve problems is the holy grail of design.

Perhaps he means that if you did a careful analysis, then it&#039;s likely that if you made some mistakes in it, you still got a better overall result (than if you did a quick careless analysis), since the analysis is robust to those mistakes (since they are a small fraction of everything that went into it). I think this implicitly assumes that the nature of a careful analysis should be to combine partial results from many independent points of view.]]></description>
