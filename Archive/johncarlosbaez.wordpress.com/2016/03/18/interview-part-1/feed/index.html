Thanks Roger. Yes, the reason I created a PDF in that form was because of the maximum speed imposed on the trains. Your speed limit rationale is apt.

On the other end, I recall leaving Gatwck Airport in a train that crept along slower than walking pace for awhile.

Agree that London Underground doesn&#039;t have the variation that you find in the country.  Also you probably won&#039;t find that variation in Switzerland where from my experience the arrival times are very tight between cities.

The modeling overall is an interesting mix of stochastic and deterministic elements.  The scheduling imposes a regularity that eventually cause the randomness to eventually sync up again. Somewhere in between semi-Markov and jitter-based stochastic modeling.]]></description>

Paul, neat analysis feom a user perspective.  I have not done that much work on trains - just 16 months at London Underground but I can fill in spme gaps for you

Trains do, indeed, obey speed limits.  Each point on the track has a maximum speed so that we can guarantee the train won&#039;t derail.  The driver must ensure that his train does not exceed the lowest speed limit under his wheels (so the speed profile of the journey depends on the length of the train).

On the underground trains also have limits (both upper and lower) on acceleration and jerk (fourth derivative of position with time).  These limits are set because people stand on trains and we don&#039;t want to knock them over.

However train performance on the underground is pretty uniform and variations in driver behaviour ore also fairly small.  The main variability comes from the &#039;dwell time&#039; ie the time between wheel stop and wheel start.  This is the period when passengers are boarding and alighting.  It depends on the number of passengers going through the doors and the distribution of passengers along the length of the train (although the door mechanism imposes a lower bound).

Once delays due to dwell get into the system you can get positive feedback.  If you assue passenger arrivals per unit time are fairly even, the increased gap between services means that more passengers will be getting on the delayed train.   Meanwhile there will be fewer passengers in the gap behind the delayed train, so it wants to go faster. (This logic also applies to buses and explains why you wait ages for a bus and then three turn up at once).  The only way to get the service back on an even keel is to deliberately introduce extra delay for the vehicle at the rear.]]></description>

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thanks.  I actually feel like a bit of a failure in this respect, because my interests keep changing, so while I keep bringing people together, I keep leaving these people behind. I recently looked back at an &quot;Addendum&quot; to one of the issues of &lt;em&gt;This Week&#039;s Finds&lt;/em&gt; --- &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week234.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&quot;week234&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, to be precise.  I was impressed by the crowd of good mathematicians who wrote fascinating comments.  Those people are largely lost to me now: apparently they&#039;re not interested in Azimuth.  That makes me feel sad.  If I&#039;d treated &#039;building a community&#039; as a goal worth pursuing for its own sake, and put time and thought into it, I could have done a lot better.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  I am obviously convinced that networks (and stochastic networks) turn up everywhere.  I am interested understand when you frame your analysis in terms of categories and n-categories but feel alienated when you push the analogies to quantum mechanics too forcefully.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I got really excited when I noticed a strange analogy between probability theory and quantum mechanics --- an analogy that makes no physical sense, because it treats &lt;em&gt;amplitudes&lt;/em&gt; as analogous to &lt;em&gt;probabilities&lt;/em&gt;.  I noticed this when learning about chemical reaction networks: the mathematics of these is closely analogous to what you see in quantum field theory.  I got really excited, then I discovered other people had done a lot of work on this analogy but somehow hadn&#039;t clarified it or underscored its strangeness.  I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.3632&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; about it with Jacob Biamonte.  But now I&#039;m largely done with that.

That was me first dipping my toe into network theory, starting around 2010.   Since quantum field theory was something I knew well, it was exciting to see the same math showing up in chemical reaction network theory.  But now I have a bigger picture of network theory, and this analogy is not the main point --- although I still believe it&#039;s profoundly mysterious and need to be understood better.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  Thank you for the work.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Roger, I peeked at part 2, and appreciate more than ever the potential for scientific creativity that the Azimuth Project has.

Regarding stochastic models of transportation, I have written about it &lt;a href=&quot;http://mobjectivist.blogspot.com/2010/04/dispersion-and-train-delays.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;

http://mobjectivist.blogspot.com/2010/04/dispersion-and-train-delays.html

Train switching is indeed a network and it would be interesting to work out to see if it makes much difference in the limit.]]></description>
