					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2016/03/30/shock-breakout/#comment-78961&quot;&gt;Grimaldi&lt;/a&gt;.

Nice!  He estimates the distance from which the neutrinos released by a supernova would be fatal:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  Karam calculates that the neutrino radiation dose at a distance of one parsec [6] would be around half a nanosievert, or 1/500th the dose from eating a banana. [7]
  
  A fatal radiation dose is about 4 sieverts. Using the inverse-square law, we can calculate the radiation dose:

$latex \displaystyle{ 0.5 \textrm{ nanosieverts } \times \left(\frac{1 \textrm{ parsec }}{x}\right)^2 =5 \textrm{ sieverts }}$

$latex x=0.00001118 \textrm{ parsecs } = 2.3 \textrm{ AU }$

2.3 AU is a little more than the distance between the Sun and Mars.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The only mistake is to give two significant figures in the final answer; I&#039;m sure it&#039;s not known that accurately.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am thinking that we see only a direction of supernova explosion, so that the theory cannot model the elementary interaction of the process; but if a similar process, like the inertial confinement fusion (in a lower energy without convective overturn), with different chemical elements and energies can be used to explore the explosion in many direction (with different spectroscopy and sensors, like a multiple particles collider), so that the correction to the Standard Model can be tested inside a controlled high density environment.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Science is not just a knowledge of facts, but a knowledge of beauty which would not have been otherwise revealed. Science is also the uncovering of logic of previously unsuspected subtlety, for all to see. Thus subjects as esoteric as how exactly supernovae explode can reveal how explanations can go about things.

Beauty itself, is partly a matter of logic: when god touches humanity with its finger in a famous painting, the beauty depicts a logic, and it is this uncovering of a logic what makes it, in part, beautiful... and certainly &quot;interesting&quot; as all great art is.

Knowing about supernovae is not just knowing how the chemistry which made Earth possible was created. It is not just about knowing the size of the universe, and how fast it is changing. It is also knowing about analogies, metaphors, logics and possibilities we never suspected, and also about our naivety, to never have suspected they were.

All of this to say it&#039;s too bad the preceding post was not equipped with a &quot;reblog&quot; button. I had started an essay on the NASA cartoon above, but then this post was published, and it would have been easier for me to reblog it than to rehash known astrophysics.
