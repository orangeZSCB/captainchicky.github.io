					<description><![CDATA[From a financial point of view, climate change adds three risk factors to all stocks:

&#8226;    The risk of damage caused by climate change.  [E.g. Miami and much coastal property is going under water eventually.  We’re just not sure exactly when.  Or, Canadian Forests and mining towns are burned by climate-change-associated wildfires.]

&#8226;    The risk of technological replacement. This applies to many industries, but it applies especially to fossil fuel companies. The price of renewable power is dropping rapidly, and as it becomes cheaper than fossil fueled electricity, state by state, the market will remorselessly eliminate fossil fueled power plants.  [In 20 years, we’ll still have some sort of cars, we’ll still wear clothing, and we’ll still have something like a phone.  But, while we’ll still use electricity, probably very little of it will come from fossil fuels.]

&#8226; Regulatory risk. Just three weeks ago, on April 22, 2016, The US, China, the European Union and 174 other countries signed the Paris Climate Accord. This accord promises substantial reductions in the use of fossil fuels. It is an unprecedented international action; and it means that fossil fuel companies will never again be growth industries.  [For instance, we know we need to leave about 80% of fossil fuels in the ground, if we are to keep climate change to a manageable level.  Those are all on some corporation’s books as “proven reserves”.   Now, who’s 80% will be left underground and become valueless?  That’s a risk to any company that owns reserves of oil.]]]></description>

Apropos Fukushima:

With Tshernobyl, nuclear power turned out (radio-) active environmental protection. What you find around Tshernobyl is a paradise of free nature (with only a few odd mutations). Short lived organisms don&#039;t care much about cancer. I&#039;m almost 50, so cancer is not troubling me either. Now we need some more Fukushima radiation to prevent ocean ecosystems from terminal collapse due to overfishing. (If only radiation could undo acidification, then I would hail the classical economists&#039;s nuclear pipe dreams...)

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=A9ihKq34Ozc -- An old German relative of Mars Joh. Pictor Florifulgurator explainig stuff.

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2zMN3dTvrwY -- Now serious: Jeremy Jackson explaining the state of the oceans at US Naval War College. Who wouldn&#039;t welcome Fukushima after pondering this?]]></description>

Good read. I bet Angela Merkel was in close contact to the Japanese back then, and thus it was a nobrainer for her to drop nuclear. It&#039;s not just the waste problem. There&#039;s the criminal neglect of the folks who decide the nuclear business. Apropos: Traditional nuclear plants are no longer economic, even when we forget about the waste and mismanagement/misplanning risks. http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2016/03/08/3757281/nuclear-industry-prices/

I don&#039;t share Gore&#039;s optimism: Electricity is not all of energy. Energy is not all of GHG production: There&#039;s also the problem of selfdestructive soil carbon oxidizing agriculture. And climate weirding is not all the existential problems the Late Homo Sapiens has to face. And these problems are not additive but multiplicative, as exemplified in Syria.

Well, sure the current evolution of electricity should give the usual economist pessimist suspects some pause for thought. And we don&#039;t even need much nuclear for the baseload if there is a decent longrange grid collecting wind power from where the wind happens to blow. Here the U.S. need to catch up, not on nuclear. (OK, maybe some waste burning new generation plants should be developed and run by govt.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;So what’s his case for optimism? A lot of it concerns solar power, though he also mentions nuclear power:&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mr. Gore may eventually want to read the article: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&#038;objectid=11600771&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Japan very nearly lost Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Optimism sells better.

The problem is how much the three giant glacial basins in Antarctica, the WAIS, Wilkes and Aurora basin can take, before failing from warm water sneaking beyond the thresholds.

In Equivalent CO2 we will be at 500 ppm within 6 years at most. Then Antarctica will be clearly unstable. A case can be made that water is already sneaking below the aforesaid basins:

But German lignite will keep us warm, after Germany turns off its nuclear reactors.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;
How optimistic should we be?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It depends on the timeframe that we want to consider, right ?

I&#039;m optimist that we can reach an almost zero emission economy by the end of this century, with the majority of the shift happening actually in half the time.

But, IMO, there is just too much infrastructure around to expect substantial change in one decade or so.

Another problem is that oil will become much cheaper once its demand starts to come down, so i think that reaching actual parity will take longer than &quot;a few years&quot;.

And finally, it seems that energy storage based on batteries can only increase gradually. A lot is being invested in battery research, without leading to any breakthrough so far.

Anyway, this is another optimistic view:

http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/29/opinion/planet-on-the-ballot.html

Interestingly, he cites Bill Gates who actually is a little more pessimistic.

This is more about the infrastructure that can be changed ... but only in due time:
