What contributes to an extra spike in global temperatures is that the El Niño contributes lots of heat to the surface of the equatorial Pacific. This heat causes more evaporation which leads to more clouds and these clouds trap infrared radiation, leading to a positive reinforcement.

Subsequently, this trapped latent heat within the clouds and atmosphere gets transported over land. The heat is released during precipitation.  That&#039;s why it&#039;s called latent heat.  The delay between a peak El Niño event and the global temperature peak can be 3 to 6 months.

For the La Nina, the cooling spikes are there but they are not reinforced because the clouds are not formed as strongly.

For the pure ENSO index, that of SOI, this EL vs LN asymmetry is not observed, since the index is simply observing the sloshing of the Pacific ocean waters and not the reinforced latent heat.

In my modeling of ENSO, I can see this asymmetry clearly.  The SOI model is best fit without an asymmetry while the NINO3.4 temperature measure fits better with a model that has more spikiness on the El Niño peaks.

It would at least be good to know, if there are even worse things lurking, like more UV lines.
Gunnar Myrhe seemed to have not known about the UV lines at mpic (at least he thanked me for pointing them out to him). And maybe he would be more alerted if he got more lines. However the &lt;a href=&quot;joseba.mpch-mainz.mpg.de/index.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;website with the lines has been since quite a while unreachable&lt;/a&gt;, moreover I still haven&#039;t got an answer to a concrete email to people there asking for absorption lines for methane in the range 170nm-750nm.]]></description>

Indeed. According to the conventional ENSO metrics such as SOI and NINO3.4, this event is still smaller in magnitude than the 1998 event. Yet it seems to be having a bigger impact on the global warming signal.

And then you have the 1983 event which in magnitude was arguably larger in SOI scale than the 1998 spike, yet that didn&#039;t have as large an impact because the concurrent volcanic eruption essentially neutralized the heating.

Since the eventual global signal lags the ENSO signal by ~6 months, we definitely will see the eventual contribution to warming by June. With the February data, it was at most 3 months since the &quot;official&quot; ENSO peak, so there is room left.

Yet, according to today&#039;s reading of SOI, it is still as strongly negative as it was late last year.

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2016/03/03/global-temperature-spike/#comment-78082&quot;&gt;Uli&lt;/a&gt;.

Uli, 
The exact value is only important in the context of how much ENSO is &lt;i&gt;explanatory&lt;/i&gt; of the current heat spike.

IMO, Eric Holthaus was trying to marginalize the impact of ENSO by claiming that ENSO is only contributing about 0.1 C to the global temperature spike.

Read again what he said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;But El Niño isn’t entirely responsible for the absurd numbers we’re seeing. El Niño’s influence on the Arctic still isn’t well-known and is likely small. In fact, El Niño’s influence on global temperatures as a whole is likely small—on the order of 0.1 degree Celsius or so.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One can&#039;t have it both ways. One can&#039;t average over a year and claim that the contribution is small (only 0.1), while at the same time point to &lt;i&gt;monthly&lt;/i&gt; extremes and claim that the high numbers are &quot;absurd&quot;.

If one compares monthly to monthly, for example NINO3.4 to global temperatures, one sees a significantly influential correlation, albeit lagged by ~6 months as the ENSO propagates across the world.

BTW, the model of ENSO that we are developing on the project forum nailed the current spike to within a few months, with the training interval extending from 1880 to 2013.  It projected a spike in 2016 not as strong as in 1998 but wider.]]></description>

I think Eric Holthaus is correct in this statement.
The influence of the ENSO on yearly global mean SAT is about 0.1°C (standard deviation).
For the strongest El Niño’s so far in 1982/83 and 1997/98 the influence of the later years (1983 and 1998) was about +0.2°C. 
The influence of the current El Niño on 2015 was about +0.1°C. If you consider warmest  El Niño minus coldest La Nina year since 1950 you will get 0.4°C from peak to peak.
Regional or monthly influence may be greater.]]></description>

I forgot to set the link on one of the &quot;this&quot; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2016/03/03/global-temperature-spike/#comment-77853&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;my comment above&lt;/a&gt;.

It was to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v7/n5/full/ngeo2138.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; (which I cant read) pointed out by Jan Galkowski which seems to describe the circulation of ozone from the Stratosphere to the Troposphere. &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2016/03/03/global-temperature-spike/#comment-78066&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Paul Pukite&lt;/a&gt; just pointed to another article in which there are images! Yeah! (partially though not fully equipped but at least) and which show the correlation between stratospheric temperatures, QBO and ozone at 30hPa, (which is according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.srh.noaa.gov/epz/?n=wxcalc_pressurealtitude&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this converter&lt;/a&gt; at ca. 21.000 km, 50hPa is at around 19.000km)) . According to the &quot;folklore&quot; mentioned in my comment above

&lt;blockquote&gt;Light of wavelengths of between 200 and 300 nm is strongly absorbed in the stratosphere by ozone. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

I don&#039;t know whether this line range is a major reason for the correlation of temperature and ozone levels (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/dv/iadv/graph.php?code=SUV&#038;program=ozwv&#038;type=vp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; another correlation), but it should be reminded of at this point.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/images/spo_ozone_web.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Here &lt;/a&gt; one sees though an ozone &lt;em&gt;depletion&lt;/em&gt; in the lower stratosphere at the south pole, but I dont know about other regions. So maybe next to circulations, also major stratospheric depletion of ozone takes place.

A paper from this year showing the significant oscillations in equatorial stratospheric temperature that are related to the QBO of winds.

Alsepan, Givo, Sandro Wellyanto Lubis, and Sonni Setiawan. &quot;Analysis of the Equatorial Lower Stratosphere Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) Using ECMWF-Interim Reanalysis Data Set.&quot; IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science. Vol. 31. No. 1. IOP Publishing, 2016.  http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/31/1/012032/pdf

The paper above describes the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_wind&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;thermal wind&lt;/a&gt; equation at the equator, which relates wind shear and temperature.

So if we have the actual forcing mechanism behind QBO understood (not the Lindzen version) then it will be easier to compensate for the deterministic temperature variations and thus isolate the underlying global warming signal.   That&#039;s the plan anyways.]]></description>

IOP Publishing, 2016.  <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/31/1/012032/pdf" rel="nofollow ugc">http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/31/1/012032/pdf</a></p>
<p>The paper above describes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_wind" rel="nofollow">thermal wind</a> equation at the equator, which relates wind shear and temperature.</p>
<p>So if we have the actual forcing mechanism behind QBO understood (not the Lindzen version) then it will be easier to compensate for the deterministic temperature variations and thus isolate the underlying global warming signal.   That&#8217;s the plan anyways.</p>

Greg,  Radiosonde data is essentially high-altitude balloon data. This goes back to about 1953, which means that there is 60+ years of data.

The equatorial radiosonde data is the primary measure of stratospheric winds and in particular a sensitive measure of the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) in those winds.

The evidence points overwhelmingly to the fact that the period of the QBO is forced by the lunisolar tides:

This is at odds with the accepted theory of QBO formulated by Richard Lindzen (yes, the AGW contrarian).  As it turns out, Lindzen admitted in 1974 that if the QBO aligned with a lunar periodicity then that would conclusively establish the forcing. Alas, Lindzen did not account for the possibility of the lunar periods aliasing with the seasonal signal and so missed discovering the true forcing mechanism,

Working this angle also on the Azimuth Forum

BTW, the temperatures also show a QBO but I assume the data at the bottom considers the entire stratosphere and not just the equatorial portion.]]></description>
