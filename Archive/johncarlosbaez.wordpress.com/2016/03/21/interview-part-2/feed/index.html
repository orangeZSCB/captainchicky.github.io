Yes you&#039;re right John. I put words in his mouth.  This is Mumford in his own words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Try explaining a relevant piece of math to a biologist (e.g. who doesn’t know what a group is)!&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another piece from his blog:
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dam.brown.edu/people/mumford/blog/2014/Grothendieck.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Can one explain schemes to biologists&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;A sad story. How much math do biologists need? I would argue first of all that oscillations are central part of &lt;i&gt;every&lt;/i&gt; science plus engineering/economics/business (arguably excluding computer science) and one needs the basic tools for describing them -- sines and cosines, all of trig of course, Euler&#039;s formula e^(ix)=cos(x)+i.sin(x) and especially Fourier series. &quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

Does he claim biologists ever had this ability to begin with?

By the way, among mathematicians David Mumford is mainly famous as an algebraic geometer.  His &lt;em&gt;Red Book of Varieties and Schemes&lt;/em&gt; is legendary.  He then shocked and no doubt disappointed many people by starting to work on applied topics.]]></description>

  What would you recommend to someone who knows most undergraduate math (basic abstract algebra, analysis, topology, geometry, etc) but little more?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I think it would be a delightful but lengthy project to understand all of Grothendieck&#039;s main new concepts: abelian categories,  schemes, sites, topoi, stacks and motives.   (The word &quot;sheaves&quot; feels like it should be on this list, and you need to understand them to understand sites, topoi or stacks---but sheaves weren&#039;t invented by him.)

Unfortunately, I don&#039;t know a book that serves as a gentle tour guide to precisely these concepts.  That&#039;s sad: they&#039;re not as hard as they&#039;re made out to be.  I have dreams of writing a book called &lt;em&gt;Scary Concepts in Mathematics&lt;/em&gt;, which would remedy this problem.  But I may never get around to writing that.

So, how about focusing on schemes?  They&#039;re fundamental to modern algebraic geometry, and there&#039;s a pretty nice free book on them:

&#8226; David Eisenbud and Joe Harris, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~aar/papers/eisenbudharris.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Geometry of Schemes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

On the other hand, looking this over, I&#039;m afraid it may contain too much jargon.

So on second thought, I suggest starting with my quick introduction to &lt;em&gt;affine&lt;/em&gt; schemes in week 1 of my &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/qg-fall2015/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Fall 2015 category theory lectures&lt;/a&gt;.  Indeed, this whole course is designed to show how your worldview changes when you start thinking with categories---you might like it, I can&#039;t tell.

General schemes are built by gluing together affine schemes just as manifolds are built by gluing together copies of $latex \mathbb{R}^n.$  But if you don&#039;t know what a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;manifold&lt;/a&gt; is, this won&#039;t make you happy!

For most people, it&#039;s probably about 50 times more important to learn what a manifold is than what a scheme is.  Depending on what you mean by &#039;geometry&#039;, you may already be comfortable with manifolds, in which case schemes should seem like a psychedelic variant on a familiar theme.]]></description>

&lt;i&gt;&quot; he accused the math world of being totally corrupt.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;

It seems a bit harsh to accuse the entire establishment of corruption.

I would recommend the author of that obit, David Mumford&#039;s book &quot;Pattern Theory: The Stochastic Analysis of Real-World Signals&quot;.  I purchased it a few years ago and have been able to apply quite a few of Mumford&#039;s ideas to what I am working on.]]></description>

The answer depends a lot on how much math you already know, and what kinds.

However, no matter what you know, it&#039;s worth reading this obituary of Grothendieck:

&#8226; David Mumford and John Tate, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dam.brown.edu/people/mumford/blog/2014/Grothendieck.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Can one explain schemes to biologists?&lt;/a&gt;, 14 December 2014.

These two famous mathematicians wrote an obituary for &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; magazine, which tried to explain in simple terms the essence of one of Grothendieck&#039;s ideas.  It was rejected as being too technical.  Mumford writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  The sad thing is that this was rejected as much too technical for their readership. Their editor wrote me that &#039;higher degree polynomials&#039;, &#039;infinitesimal vectors&#039; and &#039;complex space&#039; (even complex numbers) were things at least half their readership had never come across. The gap between the world I have lived in and that even of scientists has never seemed larger. I am prepared for lawyers and business people to say they hated math and not to remember any math beyond arithmetic, but this!?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A simplified version was later published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.]]></description>
