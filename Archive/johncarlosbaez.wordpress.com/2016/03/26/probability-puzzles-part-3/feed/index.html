					<description><![CDATA[Puzzle 1.
We are looking at infinite sequence of coin flips (the coin has two sides: S and D) and waiting for first occurrence of SS.
There are essentially 3 different states:
s0: current sequence ends with D or is empty (initial state)
s1: current sequence ends with exactly one S
s2: current sequence ends with SS (end state)

Let ei = expected number of flips to get from si to s2.
Then we have the following system of linear equations:
e2 = 0
e1 = (1/2)&lt;em&gt;(1+e2) + (1/2)&lt;/em&gt;(1+e0)
e0 = (1/2)&lt;em&gt;(1+e0) + (1/2)&lt;/em&gt;(1+e1)

Solving it gives the answer to the puzzle: e0 = 6.

Puzzle 2.
We just need to wait for the first daughter, then wait for the first son. Since expected number of trials until first success equals 1/p, where p is the probability of success, the answer is obviously 2+2=4.

Puzzle 3.
The intuition is, that Tom has to make a &quot;step back&quot; sometimes but not Lisa, therefore she accomplishes her goal sooner.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[While on the subject of what is essentially run theory, mathematician Peter Donnelly has given a TED talk on the subject of fooling juries with statistics.  His talk is based around the infamous English criminal case of Sally Clark.  To illuminate the issues he poses this problem: 
you toss an unbiased coin many times and count the number of tosses until you get the pattern ”HTH”. You then calculate the average. You repeat the experiment but this time you look for the pattern ”HTT”. The question is: ”Is the average number of trials required to get ”HTH” greater than, less than or equal to the average number of trials required to get ”HTT”? ” Donnelly has tried this out on a wide range of audiences including professional mathematicians and the audience not surprisingly says the number of trials were equal.  The expected number of trials to get ”HTH” is 10 while the expected number of trials to get ”HTT” is 8.
My paper ( $\url{http://www.gotohaggstrom.com/Fooling%20juries%20with%20statistics.pdf}$ ) explains the generating function proof of Donnelly’s claim.  This paper also sets out the background to the Sally Clark case. A 2013 English Court of Appeal case has had the effect of banning Bayesian reasoning in court cases.  This shows that the “real” world of the justice system can intersect in bizarre ways with probability theory.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[By the way, you can prove the classic result involving pascal&#039;s triangle and the fibonacci numbers by partitioning Tom&#039;s string of n children into these cases:

Tom has a total of 3 sons
Tom has a total of 4 sons

For those who aren&#039;t familiar, the relation between pascal&#039;s triangle and the fibonacci numbers involves summing over diagonals, like in this image:

Rob, sorry, I have no idea where I got the, er, idea.

“Invariant” may be a misnomer; thinking about it further, I reckon the analogy with the loop invariants of CS is not so strong.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This one got in my head, and I had to try to solve it.

First Puzzle 3.  Two children SS, SD, DS, DD.  Tom and Lisa both stop 1 out of 4.  Three Children for Tom SDS, SDD, DSS, DSD, DDS, DDD.  Tom stops 1 out of 6.  Three Children for Lisa SSS, SSD, SDS, SDD, DDS, DDD.  Lisa stops 2 out of 6.  Clearly the expected number of children is different and Lisa will have a smaller number than Tom.

For Tom&#039;s expected number of children, he has 1/4 chance stopping at 2, 1/6 stopping at 3, 2/10 stopping at 4, 3/16 stopping at 5, 5/26 stopping at 6, etc.  The stopping chance numerators are Fibonacci seeded by 1 and 1, and the denominators are Fibonacci seeded by 4 and 6.  The expected number of children is then 2&lt;em&gt;(1/4) + 3&lt;/em&gt;(1-1/4)&lt;em&gt;1/6 + 4&lt;/em&gt;(1-1/4)&lt;em&gt;(1-1/6)&lt;/em&gt;3/16+.... ie he stops at 2 with a probability of 1/4, at 3 with a probability of (1-1/4)*1/6, etc.  Perhaps there is a clever way to write that, but I wrote a little program to tell me that it goes to 6.

Lisa has 1/4 chance stopping at 2, 2/6 stopping at 3, 3/8 stopping at 4, etc.  The stopping chance numerators are 1,2,3,etc. and the denominators at 4,6,8, etc.  The same sort of calculation gives the expected number of children 2&lt;em&gt;1/4 + 3&lt;/em&gt;(1-1/4)2/6+4&lt;em&gt;(1-1/4)&lt;/em&gt;(1-2/6)*3/8+...  This one is certainly even simpler to work out in closed from , but again the program tells me that it sums to 4.]]></description>

Unfortunately if you tell this blog that you don&#039;t want comments to get indented more than 4 times (because they become absurdly skinny), it implements this by eliminating the &#039;Reply&#039; button after a comment that&#039;s been indented 4 times.

What you should do in this case is reply not to the comment but to the comment it&#039;s commenting on!   In fact it&#039;s often wise to do this.  This keeps the comments from getting too skinny.  I can tell who is a really expert blog-commenter by whether they do this.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  I thought \left{&#060;} would work for \langle but you guessed that part right.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I&#039;ve never seen \left{&#060;} in LaTeX; I think LaTeX is pretty careful about the difference between the less than symbol $latex &#060;$ and the left angle bracket $latex \langle$.

But there&#039;s an extra problem with LaTeX in most blogs!  In HTML, &#060; is an escape symbol, so you to get a less than symbol in LaTeX you have to use the HTML symbol &#038;lt; rather than &#060;.  It&#039;s very bizarre to be using HTML commands inside LaTeX equations, but that&#039;s how it works!  That&#039;s true not only for this rather brain-dead Wordpress blog but also some others I use.]]></description>
