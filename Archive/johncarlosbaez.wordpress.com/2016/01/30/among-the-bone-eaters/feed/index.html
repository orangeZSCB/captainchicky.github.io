The cover is already blown simply by the fact that the user name is a link. ;)

Neat article. Just recently, though, I learned that, while Spotted Hyenas (which this paper, of course, is about) form such large groups, the rarer Striped Hyenas actually live in much smaller groups of around 20, not unlike we once used to live. - I just mention this because in the passage you quoted, they seem to imply that hyenas in general live in such huge groups.
This practice of hyena-feeding is very interesting to me. I wonder whether, if it had been kept up long enough (it&#039;s approaching being a tradition of the past, after all), we would eventually have seen a second more or less natural petification similar to how it must have happened with dogs. - I know there is (was?) this Russian research facility where they did the equivalent thing with foxes, but that was much more artificial/methodical than &quot;We&#039;ll just randomly feed a bunch of them so we turn them into your friends.&quot;.]]></description>

Hi, David!  I didn&#039;t initially guess &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.anthropology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/kronenfeld/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;who you are&lt;/a&gt; from that monicker.  Sorry to blow your cover...]]></description>
