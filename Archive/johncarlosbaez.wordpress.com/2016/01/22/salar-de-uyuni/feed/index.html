That&#039;s really cool!  If even the humble &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; can survive such sailinity, perhaps many bacteria can.

I&#039;ve never seen four-pointed &#039;saltflakes&#039; growing in a supersaturated solution of salt, but now I&#039;m wondering why not.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Here is an interesting paper about bacteria and salt:

&#8226; Jos&#233; Marıa G&#243;mez G&#243;mez, Jes&#237;s Medina, David Hochberg, Eva Mateo-Mart&#237;, Jes&#250;s Mart&#237;nez-Fr&#237;as and Fernando Rull.  &lt;i&gt;Drying Bacterial Biosaline Patterns Capable of Vital Reanimation upon Rehydration: Novel Hibernating Biomineralogical Life Formations&lt;/i&gt;. Astrobiology, Volume 14, Number 7, 589--602. (2014)

The authors performed some laboratory experiments involving the dehydration and rehydration of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; in NaCl solutions on plastic surfaces.  &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; are eubacteria not archea but their observations may be relevant to wild haloarchea in salt flats.

They observe &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;-NaCl aggregates develop as water was removed.  The aggregates formed dendritic crystalline structures that somewhat resemble snow flakes except they have fourfold symmetry instead of sixfold symmetry.  The fourfold symmetry is not surprising since pure NaCl crystals have a face centered cubic structure.

I like this supplemental video of theirs

http://tierra.rediris.es/erica/media/Supplementary_file-Movie_3.avi

which shows a branching tree structure juxtaposed to the dendritic crystalline structure.  Both types of patterns are common in diffusion limited aggregation processes.

The authors say that the &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;-NaCl aggregates have a two layered morphology.  They write:

&lt;blockquote&gt; A thin filmlike top layer formed by NaCl conjugated to, and  intermingled with, &#039;mineralized&#039; bacterial cells covers a bottom layer constructed by the bulk of the nonmineralized bacterial cells; both layers have the same morphological pattern. In addition, optical microscopic time-lapsed movies show that the formation of these patterns is a kinetically  fast process that requires the coupled interaction between the salt and the bacterial cells.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

They propose that this two layered morphology can help protect the bacteria in the inner layer during periods of dehydration.  The structure easily dissolves when water returns and the bacteria become active again.]]></description>

Good puzzle!  I&#039;ll answer a puzzle with a puzzle:

&lt;strong&gt;Puzzle.&lt;/strong&gt;  If you stood on a perfectly spherical Earth on a very clear day, how would it look different than if you stood on a perfectly flat Earth on a very clear day?  Would the visual appearance be the same, or can you tell whether the Earth is round just by looking at it, under these idealized conditions?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2016/01/22/salar-de-uyuni/#comment-76633&quot;&gt;Steve Wenner&lt;/a&gt;.

Very nice question---this is something a good physicist would wonder about? &lt;a href=&quot;http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/11543/1/Curie&#039;s_Principle.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Curie&#039;s principle&lt;/a&gt; implies that &quot;it takes a length scale to create a length scale,&quot; so there must be some length scale at work that answers your question: for example, the depth to which the top layer of mud dries out.

The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mudcrack&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wikipedia article on mudcracks&lt;/a&gt; sheds no light on your question, though it has some nice pictures:

&lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Desiccation-cracks_hg.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Desiccation-cracks_hg.jpg/800px-Desiccation-cracks_hg.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

You&#039;ll notice there are several length scales here: big cracks and smaller cracks.  One could even imagine cracks that form a &lt;em&gt;fractal&lt;/em&gt; (ha-ha, a pun!) with &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; characteristic length scale.  But I don&#039;t believe this is a fractal, even approximately: I believe it would look noticeably different if we zoomed in or out even a little bit.

All fractals in nature are only approximate: the self-similarity only extends for a certain ratio of length scales, as small- or large-scale phenomena become important and break the rescaling symmetry.  But in some cases the approximation of rescaling symmetry is a useful one; here it seems only very slightly useful.

In fact there&#039;s a certain very famous crackpot (ha-ha, another pun!) who got his start studying fractal structures in cracks, but I&#039;d rather not name him here since he once threatened to sue me.

According to Wikipedia, this book proposes a classification of mudcracks:

&#8226; J. R. L. Allen, &lt;em&gt;Sedimentary Structures: Their Character and Physical Basis&lt;/em&gt;, Volume 2, Elsevier, Oxford, 593 pages.

I wonder how long volume 1 is!  This guy is deep into mud.

Finally, let me add that Curie&#039;s principle is not always true: it&#039;s not always true that symmetrical causes lead to symmetrical effects: &#039;spontaneous symmetry breaking&#039; can occur.  There are even examples of spontaneous breaking of rescaling symmetry, such as in quantum chromodynamics, where it&#039;s called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_transmutation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;dimensional transmutation&lt;/a&gt;.  However, mudcracks seem to have a fairly replicable, not randomly chosen, length scale, so I don&#039;t think spontaneous symmetry breaking is relevant here!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I notice that the dry season photo shows the salt flat tiled by polygonal plates of a certain size.  This reminds me of drying cracked mud flats and other similar phenomena.  I always wonder what determines the characteristic scale of the patterns.  Is this known, or a mystery?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Xerophiles/halophiles, that do various tricks with being able to dehydrate/rehydrate and/or control the salinity of their cells?

Uyuni is amazing. Lagunas near Uyuni are very outlandish and beautiful, especially Laguna Colorada. Trains are a bit overrated (and very overcrowded by tourists), but the story behind them (and places like Julaca) is the interesting part.

&lt;strong&gt;Puzzle:&lt;/strong&gt; Looking at the map of Uyuni we can estimate that there&#039;s probably, at least 32km of the salt flat expanse available in some direction. Knowing the radius of earth, the height of the spherical cap which is 32km big across its surface is (if I didn&#039;t screw up the math)

$latex d = R (1 - \cos (\frac{L}{2R})$

for

$latex L = 32 \text{km}, R = 6371 \text{km}$

is $latex d \approx 0.02 \text{km}$ — around 20 meters! Why do we call it &quot;flat&quot;?]]></description>
