					<description><![CDATA[According to this graph on the US National Snow and Ice Data Center’s website, there were 14.2 million square kilometers of Arctic sea ice on 24 February 2016. On an average year over the last three decades, it would take until about 29 April for there to be this little Arctic sea ice.

Since about 10 February, the area covered by sea ice has been noticeably below any of the last 30 years. The Arctic has experienced record-breaking temperatures of about 4° C higher than the 1951–1980 average.

This post is an update of a previous one which reported very warm temperatures in the Arctic in early January.]]></description>

The Arctic proxies indicated that the temperatures were 4C or 5C higher during the optimum.  The global temperatures you plotted don&#039;t show that because the Holocene Optimum wasn&#039;t synchronized at the north and south poles, so they weren&#039;t globally additive.]]></description>

I don&#039;t think we can count on the Holocene Optimum to have tested what happens at the temperatures we&#039;ll be seeing in the next century.  There&#039;s a lot more uncertainty in paleoclimate temperatures than current temperatures, but it&#039;s quite possible that we&#039;d already shot past the Holocene Optimum by 2004:

&lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Holocene_Temperature_Variations.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Holocene_Temperature_Variations.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

This shows 8 reconstructions of past temperatures in color, and a kind of average in black.  For details and caveats click the figure.  Note the near-vertical slope since the Industrial Revolution.

If you have some particular reason to think that temperatures &lt;em&gt;in the Arctic&lt;/em&gt; were much warmer during the Holocene Optimum, I&#039;d like to hear about that.

(As someone else mentioned, it&#039;s not just the temperature but the thickness of ice sheets that matters.)]]></description>

Natural variation may also bring unusual wind patterns and ocean currents, given multi-decade ocean modes like the PDO, 60 years is probably about 1 sample of the climate.   Methane danger from the permafrost at current temperatures is what Gavin Schmidt says is ruled out by the paleo evidence.  Presumably he means the Holocene Optimum and the previous interglacial, which was also warmer.]]></description>

Unusual &quot;wind patterns&quot; and storms is what global warming brings: more energy, thermal, dynamic and potential (higher and lower pressure systems). 
This is not hard to understand theoretically: it is just the Equipartition of Energy theorem.]]></description>
