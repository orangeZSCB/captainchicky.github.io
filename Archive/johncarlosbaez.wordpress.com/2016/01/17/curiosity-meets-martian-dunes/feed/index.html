					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2016/01/17/curiosity-meets-martian-dunes/#comment-76972&quot;&gt;Anton Sherwood&lt;/a&gt;.

That would be cool.  A bit like &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6269/162&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&#214;tzi the Iceman&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  Five thousand years ago in the European Alps, a man was shot by an arrow, then clubbed to death. His body was subsequently mummified by ice until glacier retreat exhumed him in 1991. Subsequently, this ancient corpse has provided a trove of intriguing information about copper-age Europeans. Now, Maixner &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; have identified the human pathogen &lt;em&gt;Helicobacter pylori&lt;/em&gt; within the mummy&#039;s stomach contents. The strain the “Iceman” hosted appears to most closely resemble pathogenic Asian strains found today in Central and Southern Asia.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

Yes, the dependence---or lack thereof!---of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_of_repose&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;angle of repose&lt;/a&gt; on the acceleration of gravity is a fascinating puzzle.   I&#039;d forgotten that when posting this article.  What did you learn about this?

I no longer enable comments on any of my G+ posts.  For reasons explained &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.google.com/117663015413546257905/posts/MYiSb1m4YtX&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, I find G+ to be a frustrating place for conducting conversations.  I don&#039;t want to spend time there anymore.  So if people want to talk to me, they&#039;ll have to come here, or send me an email.  I just post things on G+ to remind people that I still exist.

(Actually it&#039;s a bit more complicated than that.  I had tried to set up a system where my posts here would automatically be copied to G+ and comments there would be automatically be copied here.   That could be nice, and I&#039;d been told it was possible.  But I was unable to get it to work, perhaps because I&#039;m not naturally talented at such things and have little patience for them.  So, I gave up.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Your G+ post had me reading all sorts of things about the differences in the &quot;angle of repose&quot; between Earth and Mars. Which theoretically isn&#039;t gravity dependant although there&#039;s some evidence (including the photo in your post) that there are in fact differences.
I was ready to enjoy the conversation on your G+ post and noticed, sadly, you&#039;ve disabled your comments. Please reconsider.]]></description>
