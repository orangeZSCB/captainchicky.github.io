Great, thanks!  By chance, next week I&#039;m going to visit Gheorghe Craciun at the University of Wisconsin, to talk about chemical reaction networks.  But I haven&#039;t thought about Selkov&#039;s model for a long time, so I&#039;ll need to revive my dormant memories.  I&#039;m glad you figured out more about it!]]></description>

Thanks for the correction!  I&#039;m inclined to believe you even before checking, because the computer simulations seemed to be acting funny.  I hadn&#039;t checked the formulas myself; I just copied them down from somewhere, and it seems I either copied them wrong or my source had a mistake.

I&#039;ll try to fix this, but I&#039;m tempted to check first!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2016/01/18/glycolysis-part-2/#comment-76553&quot;&gt;John Baez&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi John,

There&#039;s a small mistake in your analysis of the stability of the fixed point of the Higgins-Selkov system. In one of your comments above, you stated that the fixed point is stable if

$latex v_0^2 &#060; \frac{k_2^2}{k_1^2}$

and unstable if

$latex v_0^2 &#062; \frac{k_2^2}{k_1^2}.$

The correct condition should be that it&#039;s stable if

$latex v_0^2 &#062; \frac{k_2^3}{k_1}$

and unstable if

$latex v_0^2 &#060; \frac{k_2^3}{k_1}.$

(Note the reversed inequalities, and the different exponents on the right hand side.) So what you stated in the article about the system having a limit cycle attractor for &lt;em&gt;larger&lt;/em&gt; values of $latex v_0$ is backwards as well.

It&#039;s for this reason that the system shown in Mike Martin&#039;s default example (with $latex k_2 = 1.00001$) has a limit cycle attractor, i.e. the fixed point is in fact unstable there. While it is &quot;barely&quot; unstable there, the simulations I&#039;ve been doing show that this system needs to be &quot;barely&quot; unstable like that in order to have a limit cycle attractor. I initially varied the parameters by somewhat large increments, and the behavior quickly became unbounded. This is explained pretty well in Rendall&#039;s notes on it (the last link in your article).

By the way, thanks for this article. I&#039;m using it as an example (in fact, a homework exercise) in my nonlinear dynamics class for biologists.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Posting a link to an R-based example of modeling glycolysis.

&lt;em&gt;&quot;If your eyes tend to glaze over when looking at this…&quot;&lt;/em&gt;. Now you know how I feel.
 The figure (12.3 from MCB, 6th Edition.) is rich in information if you know the code: &lt;em&gt;kinase, isomerase, mutase, aldolase, enolase&lt;/em&gt; are not random names - they describe specific functions. The reactions are invariably stereospecific. Some reactions may proceed in vitro, but enzyme catalysis imparts stereospecificity. Enzymes are often part of multi-protein complexes and may require co-factors (Mg2+ in this example)

In the case of NAD, the &quot;little plus sign&quot; is located on a quaternary nitrogen - four bonds instead of the usual three for nitrogen (cf the -NH2). So, the two O-s have no bearing on the matter, other than making the overall charge -1. You can&#039;t write a quaternary nitrogen as &#039;neutral&#039;. On reduction, the hydrogen can in principle come in from either side of the nicotinamide ring, and reduction to NADH &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be stereospecific (I haven&#039;t checked). Ideally one would draw the NAD/NADH molecule without the &#039;extended&#039; anhydride bridge (-P-O-P-). Using Rasmol or some other free 3D-modelling tool would provide a better idea of the 3D-shape. It&#039;s worth mentioning that NADH is fluorescent and allows reactions to be followed.

I found this set of  &lt;a href=&quot;http://homepages.ulb.ac.be/~dgonze/TEACHING/glycolysis.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;teaching slides&lt;/a&gt;  on &quot;Glycolytic Oscillations&quot; of interest - the insulin oscillation is mentioned as well as the Sel&#039;kov and later models (with references). You also get some experimental chart data!!

Apologies if the comment appears in the wrong place, it can be confusing ...]]></description>

The codimension one bifurcations were the ones I wanted, since these are precisely the ones a generic path in the parameter space will hit.  Thanks!]]></description>

In his book Goldbeter makes some remarks on the usefulness of glycolytic oscillations and apparently they are not known to be useful to the yeast. But they might be useful to us. Insulin is secreted in an oscillatory manner and there is an idea due to Keith Tornheim that these may be driven by glycolytic oscillations in the cells producing insulin. The oscillations in insulin levels are disrupted in some patients with Type 2 diabetes and this may be due to a mutation in the gene for PFK.]]></description>

Well, there is a list of &lt;em&gt;codimension one&lt;/em&gt; bifurcations (they are partially listed here http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Bifurcation#Classification_of_bifurcations, for example).
Having only one parameter restricts equilibria bifurcations to three generic possibilities: Andronov-Hopf, saddle-node (roughly, two equilibria collide and disappear) and pitchfork bifurcations (like, stable equilibrium becomes unstable and spawns two stable equilibria; it happens when system has symmetry and thus it&#039;s less generic). In nice (and, possibly, simple) cases bifurcation set is a finite union of hypersurfaces in parameter space; other bifurcation points belong to subsets of codimension greater than 1, but they still belong to this union of hypersurfaces. So this illustrates why it is more likely that we hit Andronov-Hopf/saddle-node/pitchfork bifurcation than any other.]]></description>
