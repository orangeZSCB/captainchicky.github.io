Sorry I haven&#039;t gotten back sooner.  You&#039;re a hard man to keep up with!

Low is trying to solve the AC smart grid problem:

From Wikipedia:

&lt;em&gt;An alternating current power-flow model is a model used in electrical engineering to analyze power grids. It provides a nonlinear system which describes the energy flow through each transmission line. The problem is non-linear because the power flow into load impedances is a function of the square of the applied voltages. Due to nonlinearity, in many cases the analysis of large network via AC power-flow model is not feasible, and a linear (but less accurate) DC power-flow model is used instead.&lt;/em&gt;

Low also discusses the AC frequency regulation problem, which has some similarities to a nonlinear thermodynamics problem.  I need to study this to see if there is more than a superficial analogy here.  This needs one of those Baez analogy tables!]]></description>

One thing that Blake Pollard and I had planned to study is coarse-graining Markov processes.   The goal is to systematically understand the process of replacing one description of a random process by another, coarser description.  People study this a lot, but apparently not quite as formally as I&#039;d like.

We think of a Markov process as a graph with &#039;states&#039; as vertices and &#039;transitions&#039; as edges, with a &#039;rate constant&#039; assigned to each edge.  We can &#039;coarse-grain&#039; this by mapping it to another Markov process in an onto but typically many-to-one way.]]></description>

Studying the ways in which one network can be a coarse-grained view of another one seems really useful for at least two purposes -- studying how low and high level models or histories of one system should relate, and studying good ways of summarizing a complex network being presented to a human viewer (which is a big practical need in implementing &quot;Overlaid Personal Semantic Networks&quot;).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well, the Caltech group puts smart grid development as a 20 year engineering challenge, so your timeline is right on...

The move to non-linear systems might be a good one vis-a-vis eventual smart grid applications.  Steven Low points out that the big difference between communication networks (such as TCP-IP) and power networks is the non-linearity of Kirchhoff’s laws.  This non-linearity makes it hard to isolate &quot;layers&quot; from each other.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://rigorandrelevance.wordpress.com/2013/12/02/communication-and-power-networks-architecture-part-ii/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;He states&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  I feel that the most important layering concept for power must allow us to insulate higher-level mechanisms from the physics of power flows. But it is not clear what that can be.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some insights from biology might be greatly appreciated!  Biological control systems must obviously deal with non-linear chemical systems.  John Doyle has made similar moves in looking to biological systems for insights into network architectures.

Nonetheless, I&#039;d still love to see your circuit work expanded to include active components!]]></description>

Thanks for the tip---especially because Caltech is close, so I can imagine visiting that group and talking to them.

I am surprisingly content doing work that&#039;s far from practical engineering.  I really feel I&#039;m making lots of progress toward a general theory of networks.  The specific examples of control theory and circuits are just &#039;test cases&#039; as far as I&#039;m concerned: I&#039;m not doing anything that would excite experts on those particular subjects, but that&#039;s not my goal.  I&#039;m now getting into a bit of biochemistry, mainly because it&#039;s a great example of the &lt;em&gt;nonlinear&lt;/em&gt; nonequilibrium thermodynamics of open systems.  I&#039;m expecting it to take a few years or a decade before enough mathematical infrastructure is worked out to reach really exciting applications... but by that time, I hope to have a pretty thorough view of things.

&lt;em&gt;Nonetheless&lt;/em&gt;, it&#039;s always good to hear about specific concrete problems that &#039;hands-on&#039; folks are interested in.  So, I should get to know that group at Caltech.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[John,

Happy belated new year!  I&#039;ve been a long-time fan of your work, but haven&#039;t commented before.

One obvious link between your climate change interests and your theoretical interests is the &quot;smart grid.&quot;  I agree that we&#039;re rapidly moving from the question of &quot;is climate changing&quot; to &quot;what do we do about it.&quot;  Evolution of the smart grid is one of the most important enabling technologies to doing something about climate change.  All work, including theoretical work, is very important.

Your work on applying category theory to control systems and digital circuits are promising first steps, but as you noted previously are still a long ways away from engineering practice.  But I hope that theoretical breakthroughs in the study of networks have profound impacts on engineering practice, as they are badly needed.

One interesting group studying networks broadly and smart grids in particular is at Caltech.  They have a group blog at https://rigorandrelevance.wordpress.com/.  John Doyle is a member - you&#039;ve mentioned wanting to read one of his papers previously (https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/10/03/the-network-of-global-corporate-control/).  He has broad and ambitious goals of understanding networks in general that are similar to yours but with a more engineering bent.  Steven Low has some very interesting and accessible articles comparing communication and power networks.  They recently got a large grant from ARPA-E for smart grid research.  I hope you check them out sometime.]]></description>

John,

Re: Rosen. -- Actually the book Life Itself is the introductory book I try to get my &quot;scientist&quot; friends to read, HOPING, that they will look further into his other books and articles.  His previous books Anticipatory Systems, Dynamical Systems Theory in Biology, Fundamentals of Measurement have more mind numbing (but very important insights) into the advantages [but more importantly the disadvantages] of modeling natural processes (including physics) via conventional mathematics (calculus and probability).

Re: Margulis. -- along with Rosen she points out [concretely in biology] for the need to look at systems AND their surrounding contexts (Formal [formal cause], ConFormal [efficient cause], and SubFormal [material cause])  The point being if you don&#039;t know what the semantics (the &quot;meanings&quot; of the &quot;ding auch sich&quot;) you are just mimicking the &quot;thing&quot; on the thin surface features [like Topologists ;-) ]

Re: Lane -- His latest book The Vital Question, which delves into the origins of life [from partly a non-linear &quot;thermodynamic&quot; perspective].  You might need to learn some more chemistry [or learn it on the fly] to get something out of it.  I use my insights that I learned from the origins of life to guide me in better understanding of General Relativity and four gauge &quot;forces&quot;.

<p>John,</p>
<p>Re: Rosen. &#8212; Actually the book Life Itself is the introductory book I try to get my &#8220;scientist&#8221; friends to read, HOPING, that they will look further into his other books and articles.  His previous books Anticipatory Systems, Dynamical Systems Theory in Biology, Fundamentals of Measurement have more mind numbing (but very important insights) into the advantages [but more importantly the disadvantages] of modeling natural processes (including physics) via conventional mathematics (calculus and probability).</p>
<p>Re: Margulis. &#8212; along with Rosen she points out [concretely in biology] for the need to look at systems AND their surrounding contexts (Formal [formal cause], ConFormal [efficient cause], and SubFormal [material cause])  The point being if you don&#8217;t know what the semantics (the &#8220;meanings&#8221; of the &#8220;ding auch sich&#8221;) you are just mimicking the &#8220;thing&#8221; on the thin surface features [like Topologists ;-) ]</p>
<p>Re: Lane &#8212; His latest book The Vital Question, which delves into the origins of life [from partly a non-linear &#8220;thermodynamic&#8221; perspective].  You might need to learn some more chemistry [or learn it on the fly] to get something out of it.  I use my insights that I learned from the origins of life to guide me in better understanding of General Relativity and four gauge &#8220;forces&#8221;.
