It looks like he accurately predicted both the increase in Carbon emissions and the decrease in emissions intensity of energy over the past 15+ years, but at the same time he overestimated the energy required to reach a particular level of economic activity, which seems consistent with the views he expressed in his editorial.

While it&#039;s inaccurate, I don&#039;t see any harm in overestimating how much renewable capacity we need to hit a given level of Carbon emissions. We probably need ten times more renewable generation to get our long run emissions into the 350ppm to 450ppm region.]]></description>

John, I&#039;m interested in pursuing that thread, about the impact of nuclear devices. Also interested in seeing if maintenance of zero Carbon energy sources and the nuclear plants was factored in, as is often done in sustainability analysis. References?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2016/01/25/ken-caldeira-on-what-to-do/#comment-76730&quot;&gt;Jan Galkowski&lt;/a&gt;.

The main problem with the plan of Jacobson and Delucchi is that it doesn&#039;t touch on many practical issues.  You can see a summary and critique here:

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/A+path+to+sustainable+energy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;A path to sustainable energy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Azimuth Wiki&lt;/em&gt;.

Also, they claim that nuclear power results in up to 25 times more carbon emissions than wind energy... but when you drill down into their calculations (which requires going back to an older paper by Jacobson), they assume that using nuclear power may ultimately cause a war in which fifty 15-kiloton nuclear devices are used, setting cities afire, giving CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions of 92–690 teragrams.  Their upper limit on carbon emissions for nuclear power assumes the probability of such a war is 100% and the 690 teragrams of carbon are emitted.  And they implicitly assume the probability of such a war is 0% if we don&#039;t use nuclear power!

The main problem here is that they don&#039;t mention this assumption in their later papers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[HG,

your second point is an excellent one. I work in product development, and the last thing we compete on, in fact you thing you never want to compete on is price. While it is true that the market for energy is not the same as the market for watches, say, where you can raise the price of a good and increase sales (ah, Rolex, we in product development bow to your genius) it is equally true that the the energy market is not immune to our collective desires.

Price is certainly an important factor in the energy market, but it is not the only determinant.

Here is a thought experiment. You are given the choice between buying a house that has 30k$ worth of solar panels on the roof and 10k$ worth of kitchen cabinets, or 40k$ worth of custom cabinets? Clearly, if we were pressing more of those buttons you mentionl, we might see more folks making the 30/10 choice.

I understand that marketing wont get me driving a  hover car, but it seems to do a great job of putting people in SUV&#039;s in lieu of more cost effective solutions.

In the end  the energy system we get will be the energy system we want.]]></description>

I wouldn&#039;t say incorrect, but he made some very strong statements. Graham and Greg have good points about the efficiency of heating with electricity and inefficient energy use associated with modern building design. I think this statement suggests his views on the costs of battery storage and solar power are dated.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Even so, neither wind nor solar is dependable enough, and batteries do not yet exist that can store enough energy at affordable prices to get a modern industrial society through those times when the wind is not blowing and the sun is not shining.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Tesla&#039;s powerwall has brought the cost of warrantied energy storage down to ~10+c/kWh, and utility scale solar is below 6c/kWh without subsidies. That&#039;s more expensive than the US average if we store every kWh we use, but it&#039;s less expensive if we only store half of what we use.

http://cleantechnica.com/2015/12/05/solar-power-prices-low-future/

I agree with the need to build a renewable grid, vastly improve energy use in buildings, and electrify transportation, but I don&#039;t see how that translates to a system of electricity generation that&#039;s several times larger.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Most analysts believe we should decarbonize electricity generation and use electricity for transportation, industry, and even home heating. (Using electricity for heating is wildly inefficient, but there may be no better solution in a carbon-constrained world.) This would require a system of electricity generation several times larger than the one we have now.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

35kWh of electricity from solar panels would take most EVs 100+ miles, but 35kWh of gasoline only takes a Prius 50+ miles, and to get that 35kWh of gasoline, we need to use 2-5kWh of coal, natural gas, and electricity.

I&#039;m not saying we don&#039;t need to make huge steps in how we generate and use energy, but I also think it&#039;s important for us to accurately represent the challenges ahead.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[While I very much sympathize, given that the UNFCCC and IPCC processes have, &lt;a href=&quot;http://kevinanderson.info/blog/the-hidden-agenda-how-veiled-techno-utopias-shore-up-the-paris-agreement/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;pretty much behind the scenes&lt;/a&gt;, reconciled their lofty goals of holding temperatures to no more than +1.5C to +2C above preindustrial with willingness to cut emissions by embarking upon an implicit program of massive geoengineering, there are a couple of points with which I disagree.

First, a specific one: Caldeira&#039;s parenthetic remark, that &quot;Using electricity for heating is wildly inefficient, but there may be no better solution in a carbon-constrained world&quot;, is misleading at best, and incorrect at worst. A Fujitsu &quot;Halcyon&quot; air heat pump (others are made by Mitsubishi and GE) is &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; efficient in terms of electricity-based heating (and cooling!). I know from personal experience, last winter, where, despite the deep and cold winter, our units beat, in price, the costs of oil heating with forced hot water heating elements, and did it by 20%, despite operating at near the limits of the heat pumps&#039; operational range, and &lt;i&gt;including&lt;/i&gt; a cost penalty for our purchasing our electrical energy locally &lt;i&gt;entirely&lt;/i&gt; from New England Wind sources.

Second, in the same way that exponential growth can be destructive for a world which needs to find ways of sustainable growth, I believe there are ways of jiggering business and economics which could put zero Carbon energy sources on an exponential growth path.  Once that is done, &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt; is achievable within decades, if the exponential coefficient is adjusted correctly. The point is, in my personal opinion, we need to stop thinking of the public as a bunch of free will individuals and, instead, in the way advertisers do, as a body of people who have buttons to be pushed, and can be motivated to do things, with dynamics governed by equations like the rest of Nature. With ordinary things, even security things, do that would give me pause. Doing it for the existential risks to civilization that climate disruption poses is no problem for me.]]></description>

It&#039;s just a kind of &#039;column&#039; or &#039;opinion piece&#039; in the &lt;em&gt;Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;.  So yeah, it won&#039;t have references.  But it gains its credibility from the fact that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Caldeira&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ken Caldeira&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most famous climate scientists thinking about global warming.  So, if he says the conclusions of &lt;a href=&quot;http://stephenschneider.stanford.edu/Publications/PDF_Papers/HoffertEtAl.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;his 1998 &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; piece&lt;/a&gt; still hold, one would like to see some evidence---if not here, somewhere---that this is true.

Of course it&#039;s also worth reading that 1998 &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; piece, to see what the conclusions actually were!]]></description>
