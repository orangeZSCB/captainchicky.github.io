Agreed.  I often argue with some people who try to do that.  I believe the IEA, whatever their problems, is not so dumb as to do this.

Regarding your main point, namely that &lt;em&gt;prices matter&lt;/em&gt;, the IEA came out with a report that I want to read and post about here:

There are also engineering responses to some of the problems cited in Rob&#039;s post, such as cloud cover, strings going down, and the Bird Poop Problem. From personal experience with our recently installed 10 kW (nameplate) 29 panel array from SunPower and RevoluSun, some of the best days in our situation are diffuse cloudly days. We have a lot of tree cover at the horizon, and the shading that would otherwise affect the array at some Sun azimuths goes away with cloud cover.  Also, this array has SunPower optimizers on it, which allow it to work when parts of panels are shaded. Also, the SunPower panels have white margins around the cells, making each look like an eye. This is a passive bird discouragement. Also, because the panels operate warmly, the usual way poop gets removed -- I&#039;ve witnessed this -- is for a snowfall.  The snow melts off and carries dust and poop along with it.

In summary, just looking at direct physics of cells and Sun is not sufficient to tell generation when there&#039;s control logic and engineering in-between.]]></description>

SOD,

preface this by saying I read SOD at lunch and enjoy it. Thanks for putting it together.

re &quot;first you have varying efficiencies...&quot; etc. I don&#039;t think so. That is accounted for in the name plate. efficiency for a panel is basically power out @ STC (Standard Test Conditions) divided by module area. Different manufacturers will sometimes play with the area quoting &quot;apperature efficiency&quot; which is a  way of excluding the frame from the area calculation.

The reason for the standard test conditions is fairly obvious. You need a way to compare panels. Thus standards. Why 25C if panels almost never operate at those temps (and typically operate much hotter? The sun is hot, right?) Well, we humans are adverse to working in 41 C environments. If we could just figure out a way to get iguana&#039;s to work for us, we could get a more accurate estimate of output power.  Companies will publish, and in fact compete on module temperature coefficients, how much power is impacted by temperature (hotter is bad, colder is good) a fun read on this this is &quot;Third Generation Photovoltaics by Martin Green. He goes through all the basics of solar cell efficiency physics, and all the thermodynamic limits for different cell strategies. Amazingly because the sun is do hot and the earth so cool, the carnot limit for a solar cell is crazy high 95%. The book is basically about why in practice we can&#039;t get there.

Of course for solar installs, name plate isn&#039;t power output. Where I live, you can expect about 10% of name plate on an annualized basis. I take lots of vitamin D in the winter. There are lots of factors in addition to the one&#039;s you named, like cloud cover, angle the panels are installed (usually you follow the roof line for a house), growth rate of your neighbors trees, bird poop (yes, there is an actual industry problem referred to as &quot;the bird poop problem, the cells in modules are strung in series, so when one cell gets hit, it pulls the entire module down. )

Given that, it seem unlikely that the IEA would be better at predicting power output than predicting name plate capacity. This is surprising.

I also made the comment today at my blog posting regarding the Lazard&#039;s LCOE study: &quot;Only thing further I’d say about this and evaluations like it, is that they don’t reflect the benefit of residential solar PV being put in with capital that’s been raised and paid for by entities other than utilities, or society. Sure, these are often subsidized with tax breaks and I see these less as incentives for installing residential solar and more as a reward for people to put their capital at risk to provide a social benefit, whether that’s excess electrons generated for society’s use, or load that’s been shed onto a local generator.&quot;]]></description>

Thanks. That&#039;s a really useful website. Shame it can&#039;t track the UK solar generation explicitly but I guess that is not possible for domestic solar. Would be interested if the commercial sites have to report in any way.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One thing seems to be entirely absent from this discussion: what the price of power is as generated by various different means. Price is what drives such things.

The exponential rise in renewables is not a phenomenon that should be predicted by some sort of model-free curve fitting as the causes here are understood. Uptake of new generation methods is driven by human greed. Most specifically, it is driven by the fact that as the price of power from renewables drops further and further, and especially as it drops substantially below the cost of power from other sources, we can generally expect that people will prefer to purchase power from the lower cost method of generation.

Technological cutovers have happened many times in human history, often with surprising speed. If something is cheaper and a near or exact substitute for another good, people buy it in preference to the more expensive good. Therefore, if you want to understand uptake, you have to look at prices, not model-free curve fits. If you know what the price is, and what it is likely to be based on foreseeable technological shifts, you can likely predict uptake.

You will find, if you look closely, that the price of photovoltaics (which I&#039;m more familiar with than wind) has been dropping quite rapidly over the last decade, and is now already substantially below the price of fossil fuel power in places where fossil fuel power is particularly expensive, such as Hawaii. Not surprisingly, in such places the uptake of PV generation has been extremely rapid. In places where the price of PV power is not yet below that of other generation methods, such as places with relatively low insolation and plentiful nearby sources of fuel, the uptake has been much slower.

However, as the price trend for the fuels is relatively stable over long periods and has a floor at long term production costs, while the price of photovoltaics seems to be bounded more by efficiencies in manufacturing and installation than by any sort of materials costs, the price of PV still has a long way to drop before it hits a steady state baseline. We can therefore expect rapid continued uptake even in places like the Northeastern United States and Canada because of price drops.

Equally interesting, uptake has been very rapid in the third world where power grids are often absent or unreliable and where operating costs of small (building or village scale) PV systems are much more affordable.]]></description>

In terms of what this all means, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svlU6p0gHgo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Kevin Anderson of University of Manchester has consistently maintained&lt;/a&gt; that, while wind and solar are good, they cannot be brought online fast enough to keep  within +2C above preindustrial, especially if developing nations are going to be allowed leeway to get their economies ready for zero Carbon emissions.

Accordingly &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; has maintained, and I&#039;m increasingly in agreement, is that the alternative is to push energy efficiencies in a big way and, meantime, people who are part of the global 1% who are responsible for 50% of the world&#039;s greenhouse gas emissions should curtail their consumption and transportation to buy zero Carbon energies time.  He is &lt;em&gt;particularly&lt;/em&gt; scolding of climate scientists and other academicians who certainly know better and yet trot across the planet going to meetings by air. Air transport has a particularly large impact, since the same unit of CO2 emission at altitude has a bigger warming effect than if emitted at sea level. (This was part of the problem with the Permian mass extinction. The large igneous provinces created updrafts that lifted gases high in the troposphere and into the low stratosphere.) This is very hard.

Anderson makes the case that despite the unpopularity of this approach, to the degree that the economies of the 1% benefited from high &lt;em&gt;per capita&lt;/em&gt; greenhouse gas emissions and, morally speaking, if anyone should take a cut in standard of living, it&#039;s them, meaning you and me and us.

The alternative, of course, is a miracle of solar and wind deployment, and electric transport.  Miracles really oughtn&#039;t be depended upon.]]></description>

Thanks for your clarification!

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  The IEA WEO primarily predicts energy production (not nameplate installation). But it’s 738 pages and I’m sure there are nameplate predictions in there as well.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Perhaps it&#039;s worth emphasizing that the eye-catching graphs I got from David Roberts&#039; article claim to show the IEA&#039;s predictions of  &#039;capacity&#039;.  I suppose I should be careful in guessing what that means, but I would imagine it means something more like &#039;nameplate&#039; than &#039;production&#039; or &#039;consumption&#039;:
