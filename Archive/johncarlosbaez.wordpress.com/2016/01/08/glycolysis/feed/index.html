					<description><![CDATA[If you put yeast cells in water containing a constant low concentration of glucose, they convert it into alcohol at a constant rate. But if you increase the concentration of glucose something funny happens. The alcohol output starts to oscillate!

It’s not that the yeast is doing something clever and complicated. If you break down the yeast cells, killing them, this effect still happens. People think these oscillations are inherent to the chemical reactions in glycolysis.

I learned this after writing Part 1, thanks to Alan Rendall.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2016/01/08/glycolysis/#comment-76256&quot;&gt;Tim Silverman&lt;/a&gt;.

This is really, really nice.

It reminds me of how Balaban applies graph theory to chemistry at both levels: the level of individual molecules (which can be drawn rather abstractly as graphs) and at the level of reaction networks (which are also graphs).  I would love it if there were something profound about &#039;graphs of transformations of graphs&#039; going on here.  I don&#039;t see what that would be.  But you have a delightfully clear way of thinking about why glycolysis works the way it does.

Over on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.azimuthproject.org/discussion/comment/15101/#Comment_15101&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Azimuth Forum&lt;/a&gt; I just told a chemist:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  My real aim, ultimately, is to treat things at such a high level of abstraction that I don&#039;t focus on any details of particular molecules or chemical reactions.  You can imagine, if you like, that I want to understand biochemistry not only on all possible planets, but in all possible universes.
  
  This may sound strange, but there are some reasons for doing it.  One is that I can never match biochemists for knowledge of specifics; I can only do something new by doing something different, and I hope that &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; aspects of how life works involve quite abstract and general patterns that &lt;em&gt;just happen to be implemented&lt;/em&gt; in certain specific ways in the life we see here on our planet.
  
  Of course I&#039;m also fascinated by the gory specifics of what we happen to actually see.
  
  My friend Tim Silverman, who usually tells me wonderful things about group theory (he&#039;s a programmer who has become an expert on finite simple groups), has written a [eally nice comment on the Azimuth blog, in which he describes glycolysis in a very nice conceptual way that still grapples with the chemical details.  I like this middle ground.  But I would need to know a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; more chemistry to understand things at this level!
&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I want to say something fairly concrete about glycolysis, and then say something about the combinatorial and control/computational generalities involved.

1) A way to &quot;read&quot; glycolysis&#8212;an overview to make it a bit less &quot;complicated&quot;.

I&#039;d divide this reaction sequence into three main sections with different subgoals.

a) First, we want to convert a hexose (6-carbon sugar, i.e. glucose) into two identical triose (3-carbon) phosphates.

The first 5 steps are therefore: stick a phosphate on one end of the molecule, do some internal rearrangement, stick another phosphate on the other end, split it into two different 3-carbon phosphates, convert one of the 3-carbon phosphates to be the same as the other.

b) We then have a 2-step section which goes: oxidise one of the carbons while sticking a phosphate on it (to hang onto the oxidation energy), then extract that energy into ATP by taking the phosphate off again.

c) We then have a few steps to &#039;activate&#039; the remaining phosphate (the one added in section a). We have two neighbouring oxidised carbons, one with a phosphate on it, the other with just a hydroxyl, and the reactions try to, as it were, push the oxidatedness of the hydroxyl carbon onto the phosphate carbon, to make the phosphate-carbon arrangement more energetic. Then the high energy bond can be used to make ATP in the final step.

2) Organisation of the substrate structures

a) One general theme here is manipulating the reactiveness/inertness of particular sites of the molecule. C-H and C-C single bonds are pretty inert; C=C double bonds are more attackable due to the soft, floppy pi-bonds sticking out to the sides; C-O bonds are attackable because the electronegative O pulls electrons off the C, making it vulnerable to nucleophilic attack.

There&#039;s a correlation here (I&#039;m not sure how coincidental it is) with oxidation states&#8212;adding oxygens (possibly while eliminating water to give double bonds) both oxidises the carbons and increases their reactivity. A lot of what is going on here involves what might very loosely be called internal redox reactions, along with dehydrations and other rearrangements, with the goal of making particular sites on the molecule more or less reactive.

From this point of view, different locations in the carbon skeleton of a biomolecule, and different types of reactive group within it (hydroxyl, carbonyl, carboxylate, phosphate, etc) have their own character or identity. Tracking individual atoms is maybe not the best way to think about this, although it&#039;s obviously necessary from a bookkeeping point of view.

b) Phosphates obviously play a central role in moving stored energy between molecules, and a key goal is assembling high-energy phosphate-containing groups at crucial stages of the reaction.

3) This reaction sequence starts with an irreversible reaction that adds a phosphate, and ends with an irreversible reaction which removes one. This sort of thing is typical.

a) Adding a phosphate can tag a molecule for entry into a particular pathway

b) Adding a phosphate may sometimes prime a molecule with energy needed in later steps of the pathway

c) Irreversible steps can help partition the total reaction network into manageable subsections

d) Relatedly, irreversible steps are a good target for enzyme regulation, whether by allosteric interactions in which products or substrates directly attach to the enzyme and alter its activity, or by an (enzyme-mediated) tagging of the enzyme (for instance by adding or removing a phosphate group) to alter its activity in response to a signal from elsewhere.

This way of thinking is all a lot more combinatorial than thermodynamic, but maybe is at least more mathematical than looking at particular molecular structures.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think that the life is a engine near a critical point (near a phase transition only for a thermodynamic system).
If there is a generalization of the definition of physical engine to an object that generate flow of information, or that transfer entropy in the environment, then the life could be generalized to each system, chemical, electrical, mechanical, a computer program, a database computer software, because of the entropy use is common in every science field (so that the life can exist in each science field).
Usually the temperature of the life is greater of the environment, because of the  inner engine, and I am thinking that the life could use the sleep-wake to obtain the phase transition point, so that I am thinking that could exist life form with temperature lower of the environment, with a physical engine that work like a refrigerator with the sleep-wake transition.]]></description>

Oh yeah, I can as well provide the purported answer to &#039;what problem life solves&#039;. It is the geological continuation of high temperature processes as a terrestrial planet cools, processes that tries to oxidize the mantle against the planet&#039;s hydrogen surplus.

If so it is very loosely helpful to understand why enzymes kicks in and why hydrogen based metabolism is the root metabolism, not so much with the many, many, ...., many other historical details.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;I instantly wanted to get an overall view of these reactions, without immersing myself in all the details.

Unfortunately I don’t know how to do this. Do you?&quot;

Maybe the comment I posted on the &quot;Biology and the Pi-Calculus&quot; thread is even more apt here. I am reviewing the latest Astrobiology meeting, and a popular description of life was as an opportunistic geological process. Other descriptions are selfish genes (that control metabolism) and energy &#038; matter utilization (controlled metabolism). In both cases the described system is nothing but historical detail heaped on each other with no other guiding principle for the participating populations but that &quot;it works&quot;.

For example, to utilize matter cells has to order it by pushing a disequilibrium closer to equilibrium. But to utilize energy cells may have to scavenge for electrons, which ultimately may lead to increased disequilibrium (oxygen atmosphere). It is an interplay between reduction and oxidation, making and disappearing disequilibriums, producing and consuming biochemicals, et cetera. The research edge is - still - here, because you can hear plenary sessions asking for principles of life (and sometimes anthropomorphically sloppily refer to it as &#039;purpose&#039;: &#039;what is the problem life solves?&#039;). [ http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/abscicon2015/pdf/program.pdf ; &quot;PLENARY SESSION: PLANETS IN PERSPECTIVE: WHERE’S THE ENERGY?&quot; http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/abscicon2015/pdf/sess501.pdf ]

TL;DR: It is complicated, the maxwellian demon may or may not be in the details, and life has no free lunch.

Linking Philippa Wiggins&#039;s paper was timely, I had forgotten about it and see below why a reminder was good!

I don&#039;t know how controversial it is. Certainly such people as Russell, of the vent theory for life emergence, describes energy transduction in electron bifurcating catalysts where Wiggins&#039;s dissipation concerns does not seem to apply, elevating them (erroneously, I think) to redox engines. (And see the plenary session I linked to for one of the proponents.)

However, just today there is yet another paper out that tries to predict water characteristics from chemistry, and it seems to support Wiggins general model:

&quot;In a review paper published in Nature Communications, physicists Anders Nilsson and Lars G.M. Pettersson from Stockholm University have pulled together the results from dozens of papers published over the past several years that have investigated water&#039;s molecular structure, often with the help of cutting-edge experimental tools and simulations.

In their interpretation of the data, the researchers have proposed a picture of water in which its unique properties arise from its heterogeneous structure.

The researchers propose that, in the pressure (P) and temperature (T) region where water exhibits its anomalous behaviors (the funnel-like region in the P-T phase diagram above), water coexists in two different types of structures: a highly ordered, low-density structure with strong hydrogen bonds, and a somewhat smashed, high-density structure with distorted hydrogen bonds. The origins of water&#039;s anomalous properties arise because these two types of structures are constantly fluctuating between one another in this heterogeneous phase, resulting in many small spatially separated regions of different structures.&quot;

&quot;&lt;b&gt;One unanswered question, for instance, is why does water&#039;s anomalous region occur at the same temperatures and pressures that sustain life? It seems likely that water&#039;s anomalous region served to place constraints on the conditions required for life to exist. A better understanding of this overlap could have implications for understanding life on a fundamental level.&lt;/b&gt;&quot;

[ and the article then goes into necessary tests; http://phys.org/news/2016-01-uncover-unusual-properties.html#jCp ; my bold.

Disclaimer: swede here, but SU is not my alma mater. My interest is rather here:]

If Wiggins solves the remaining two non-spontaneous steps in an enzyme free pathway between Keller et al&#039;s Hadean pentoses &#038; amino acids and the purine products, vent theory has its RNA world basis.]]></description>
