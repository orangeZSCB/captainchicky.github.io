That&#039;s a cool idea!  A fair amount of intelligence would be required for these gliders to choose trajectories take them up into clouds.  An alternative would be use actual frigatebirds!  We could fit some frigatebirds with measuring apparatus.   People already use seals to measure ocean conditions:

					<description><![CDATA[I had thought that the trajectories of the frigatebird could be used by autonomous little gliders to take low cost weather measures (temperature, pressure, humidity and others) for long times without fuel (using solar panels for the batteries used for transmissions and commands); if there are not metallic parts, then there should be no problem with glider strike against an aircraft engine.
If the cost of the measures is low, then the cost of the weather knowledge may be lower.]]></description>

Thanks John.  And looking more closely at diagram (c) I see that during ascent, the bird&#039;s ground displacement is almost exactly crosswind(!).  So in that scenario at least, it would seem that a left-of-windward glide or dive/glide from point 2 could indeed have yielded a net windward ground displacement after one soaring cycle, with nary a flapped wing.]]></description>

I&#039;m no expert in bird dynamics, but presumably if you&#039;re an albatross, once you&#039;ve gained a lot of height, and thus potential energy, you can spend it by coasting down in any direction you want... though of course you&#039;ll go further &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; the wind than against it.

I imagine people who fly hang gliders know quite a bit about this kind of issue.]]></description>

Q for the many human readers more physically astute than I (or for pretty much any albatross, but please don&#039;t tell me “we just wing it&quot;)-

I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt;  the albatross article describes how the bird can gain energy (and ultimately glide long distances) using winds whose speed is low at low altitude and high at higher altitudes, and whose direction is horizontal and constant over space and time.

Is that right?  If so, is there any constraint on the bird&#039;s large scale travel direction relative to the wind direction?  (E.g. could the semicircle in diagram (a) have been completed to a circle, without any variability in wind direction)?]]></description>

Nice article!

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3434196/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;500&quot; src=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3434196/bin/pone.0041449.g001.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  [...] it would be difficult to explain albatrosses&#039; foraging strategies without considering proper adaptations necessary to reduce energy expenditures. The first of these adaptations is anatomical. Albatrosses have an elbow-lock system operating which keeps their wings open without any muscle activity, e.g. no energy expenditure. The second adaptation concerns a flight mode – dynamic soaring. It enables albatrosses to gain the energy required for flying from the constant strong winds common in the marine environment. What physical rules in terms of special flight technique or interaction between bird&#039;s motion and wind govern such outstanding travelling performance in regard to the energy cost of flying?
  
  [...]
  
  This paper presents the first experimental results on the small-scale movements constituting dynamics soaring which enables albatrosses to fly at no mechanical energy cost. We use in-flight-measurement data to show how birds gain the energy required for flying without flapping their wings from the moving air in the shear wind above the sea surface. Based on these high-precision data achieved with a new, in-house developed GPS-signal tracking method, it was possible to analyse the dynamic soaring flight manoeuvre in detail.

					<description><![CDATA[Cool!  Thanks for posting.

Albatrosses appear to use a different mechanism to extract energy from the air.  Using it, they can also fly with little expenditure of metabolic energy.
