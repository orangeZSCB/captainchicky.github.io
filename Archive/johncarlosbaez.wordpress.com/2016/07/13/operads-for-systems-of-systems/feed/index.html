					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2016/07/13/operads-for-systems-of-systems/#comment-81836&quot;&gt;Paul Bancroft&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks, I&#039;ll try that lecture by Geoffrey West sometime.  Actually I don&#039;t enjoy videos very much, because they tend to be rather slow unless the material being presented is very hard, so I&#039;ll start by seeing if Geoffrey West wrote anything on this topic.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  You then go on to say that there is no such “real world” example of this (or words to that effect).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I doubt I said exactly that, because electrons, protons and neutrons are examples of spinors.  All matter is largely made of spinors!

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  Would I be the first to notice...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

No, but it&#039;s a nice observation.  Another way to say what you&#039;re saying is that the edge of the M&#246;bius strip is a &#039;connected double cover&#039; of the circle at the center of the M&#246;bius strip: two points at the edge correspond to each point at the center, and yet the edge is connected.  The group of symmetries of a spinor, called Spin(n), is similarly a connected double cover of the group of rotations in n dimensions, called SO(n).  So there&#039;s a relationship, which is strongest in 2-dimensional space: the group SO(2) is a circle and the group Spin(2) can be visualized as the edge of a M&#246;bius strip.

So no, the M&#246;bius strip is not a spinor, but the math of M&#246;bius strips is related to the math of spinors.  This relation is used here to help explain spinors:

					<description><![CDATA[Hello John,

I&#039;ve been following you since I discovered your wonderful three lecture series about the numbers 5,8 and 24 - thank you :)

For a higher level overview of biological systems you might find the work of Geoffrey West of interest (if you don&#039;t know his work already). He seems to have been studying biological systems for a while now. Here is a lecture of his that I found interesting:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFFVSvAr7Wc

P.S.
In one of your 5,8,24 lectures you mention &#039;spinors&#039; and the fact that they have the special property that you must rotate them twice to get them back to where they started from (something that at first seems rather ludicrous). You then go on to say that there is no such &quot;real world&quot; example of this (or words to that effect).

Would I be the first to notice that if one takes a Mobius strip, holds the twisted section in one hand (steady) and rotates the loop through the hand gripping the twist - such that the twist never moves, that you have to turn the darn loop twice to get the strip back to the starting orientation?

Does this count as a &#039;spinor&#039; ?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have been following David&#039;s work for a while, but I hadn&#039;t seen that paper yet, thanks for the share. It&#039;s very nice to see how his work has developing, I&#039;m really enjoying this Operad direction.

I hope to see more writing from you on the subject too!

&quot;My philosophy is that while biology seems “messy” to physicists, living systems actually operate at higher levels of abstraction, which call for new mathematics.&quot;
This is one of the coolest insights into modelling living systems that I&#039;ve seen :)

P.S. for anyone interested, here&#039;s a direct link to David&#039;s video https://mbi.osu.edu/video/player/?id=3902&#038;title=Operads+as+a+potential+foundation+for+systems+of+systems]]></description>
