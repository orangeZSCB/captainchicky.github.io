					<description><![CDATA[A lot of different diamondoids occur naturally in petroleum.  Though the carbon in diamonds is not biological in origin, the diamondoids found in petroleum are composed of carbon from biological sources.  This was shown by studying the ratios of carbon isotopes present.

Eric Drexler has proposed using diamondoids for nanotechnology, but he&#039;s talking about larger molecules than those shown here.

In the comments on that post, a bunch of us worked on some puzzles connected to &#039;topological crystallography&#039;---a subject that blends graph theory, topology and mathematical crystallography.  You can learn more about that subject here:

Greg Egan and I got so interested that we wrote a paper about it!

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2016/04/11/diamonds-and-triamonds/#comment-79637&quot;&gt;John Baez&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks!  I believe they proved some of the stuff Greg just proved, and more generally.

Namely, for any finite directed graph $latex \Gamma$ they let the space of &lt;strong&gt;1-cochains&lt;/strong&gt; $latex C^1(\Gamma,\mathbb{Z})$ consist of functions from edges to integers.  This is isomorphic to the lattice I&#039;ve been calling $latex L_E$: the lattice spanned by &#039;edge vectors&#039;.

They define a Laplacian $latex \Delta$ on 1-cochains: given a 1-cochain $latex f,$ they define $latex (\Delta f)(e)$ to be $latex 2 f(e)$, minus the sum of $latex f(e&#039;)$ over edges $latex e&#039;$ that end where $latex e$ starts, minus the sum of $latex f(e&#039;&#039;)$ over edges $latex e&#039;&#039;$ that start where $latex e$ ends.

They let $latex \Lambda^1(\Gamma,\mathbb{Z})$ consist of 1-cochains that are in the kernel of the Laplacian.  This is isomorphic to the lattice that I&#039;ve recently taken to calling $latex L_L$: the lattice spanned by &#039;loop vectors&#039;.

Greg and I showed that

$latex &#124;L_E/L_T&#124; = &#124;T&#124; $

where $latex &#124;T&#124;$ is the number of spanning trees in the graph.

I believe their Proposition 1.3 is closely related to this result.  They say:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  The determinant of $latex \Lambda^1(\Gamma,\mathbb{Z})$ is equal to the complexity of $latex \Gamma.$
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The &lt;strong&gt;complexity&lt;/strong&gt; of $latex \Gamma$ is just the number of spanning trees.

Hmm, but I&#039;m a bit puzzled about this &#039;determinant&#039;.]]></description>

You&#039;re right.  For each extra handle you add to a torus, you get two noncontractible loops that cross each other: one that runs &#039;around&#039; the handle and one that runs &#039;along&#039; it.  (Sorry, those prepositions quite don&#039;t do justice to the geometry.)  So for Klein&#039;s quartic we must take into account 6 loops besides the ones that run around faces.

The fancy way to talk about this relates the first homology group of the graph (which is a free abelian group on some number of generators) to the first homology group of the surface (which is a free abelian group on some smaller number of generators).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve just realised that some of the results we&#039;ve proved &lt;b&gt;won&#039;t&lt;/b&gt; hold for graphs that embed in surfaces of higher genus, such as Klein&#039;s quartic curve.  So, &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2016/04/11/diamonds-and-triamonds/#comment-79616&quot;&gt;those packing densities I calculated&lt;/a&gt; for the two graphs in Klein&#039;s quartic curve are almost certainly wrong.

I computed a basis for the lattice $latex L_L$ of translation symmetries of the crystal by assuming that you get a basis for all the loops in the graph by following the edges around each of $latex &#124;F&#124;-1$ faces.  But the dimension of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_basis&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;cycle space&lt;/a&gt; of a graph is always $latex d_C = &#124;E&#124;-&#124;V&#124;+c$ for a graph with $latex c$ connected components.  For a single connected component, we have:

$latex d_C = &#124;E&#124;-&#124;V&#124;+1 = &#124;F&#124;+1-\chi$

where $latex \chi$ is the Euler characteristic.  For a sphere $latex \chi = 2$ and the dimension of the cycle space is $latex d_C = &#124;F&#124;-1$, but for Klein&#039;s quartic curve with $latex \chi=-4$, we have $latex d_C = &#124;F&#124;+5$.

This means that for a graph embedded in Klein&#039;s quartic curve, there will be loops in the graph such that when we sum the associated edge vectors, the result need not lie in the lattice generated by the vectors we get from taking loops around all but one face in the graph.  I say &quot;need not&quot; rather than &quot;does not&quot;, because if we&#039;re still working in $latex \mathbb{R}^{&#124;F&#124;-1}$ there&#039;s the complication that the full set of $latex &#124;F&#124;+5$ loop vectors won&#039;t be linearly independent, so I&#039;m not sure exactly what will happen.  The one thing that&#039;s clear is that all integer-linear combinations of all $latex &#124;F&#124;+5$ loop vectors will yield translation symmetries of the crystal, whether or not that lattice in $latex \mathbb{R}^{&#124;F&#124;-1}$ is the same as the one generated by the $latex &#124;F&#124;-1$ loops associated with faces.]]></description>

But the dimension of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_basis" rel="nofollow">cycle space</a> of a graph is always <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d_C+%3D+%7CE%7C-%7CV%7C%2Bc&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="d_C = |E|-|V|+c" class="latex" /> for a graph with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="c" class="latex" /> connected components.  For a single connected component, we have:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d_C+%3D+%7CE%7C-%7CV%7C%2B1+%3D+%7CF%7C%2B1-%5Cchi&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="d_C = |E|-|V|+1 = |F|+1-&#92;chi" class="latex" /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cchi&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;chi" class="latex" /> is the Euler characteristic.  For a sphere <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cchi+%3D+2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;chi = 2" class="latex" /> and the dimension of the cycle space is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d_C+%3D+%7CF%7C-1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="d_C = |F|-1" class="latex" />, but for Klein&#8217;s quartic curve with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cchi%3D-4&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;chi=-4" class="latex" />, we have <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d_C+%3D+%7CF%7C%2B5&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="d_C = |F|+5" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>This means that for a graph embedded in Klein&#8217;s quartic curve, there will be loops in the graph such that when we sum the associated edge vectors, the result need not lie in the lattice generated by the vectors we get from taking loops around all but one face in the graph.  I say &#8220;need not&#8221; rather than &#8220;does not&#8221;, because if we&#8217;re still working in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E%7B%7CF%7C-1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}^{|F|-1}" class="latex" /> there&#8217;s the complication that the full set of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7CF%7C%2B5&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="|F|+5" class="latex" /> loop vectors won&#8217;t be linearly independent, so I&#8217;m not sure exactly what will happen.  The one thing that&#8217;s clear is that all integer-linear combinations of all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7CF%7C%2B5&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="|F|+5" class="latex" /> loop vectors will yield translation symmetries of the crystal, whether or not that lattice in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E%7B%7CF%7C-1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}^{|F|-1}" class="latex" /> is the same as the one generated by the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7CF%7C-1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="|F|-1" class="latex" /> loops associated with faces.</p>

Sunada has a somewhat different abstract interpretation of Kirchhoff&#039;s matrix tree theorem.  It&#039;s Theorem 10.8 in his book &lt;em&gt;Topological Crystallography&lt;/em&gt;, though he may not have been the first to prove it.

He starts with a graph $latex X$ and lets $latex \mathrm{Div}^0$ consist of functions from vertices of $latex X$ to $latex \mathbb{Z}$ with the property that when you sum their values over all vertices you get zero.

$latex \mathrm{Div}^0$ is an abelian group.  Sitting inside here is a subgroup, namely the range of

$latex \Delta: \mathrm{Div}^0 \to \mathrm{Div}^0 $

where $latex \Delta$ is the graph Laplacian.  Let&#039;s call this subgroup $latex \Delta \mathrm{Div}^0.$

He shows that the number of points of $latex \mathrm{Div}^0 /  \Delta \mathrm{Div}^0$ is the number of spanning trees in $latex X.$

Note that this &#039;summing over all vertices gives zero&#039; condition is dual to our condition on face vectors, where we like the sum over all faces to give zero.  Note also that his formulation doesn&#039;t mention the dual graph of $latex X.$  So apparently he has moved completely over to the dual picture, as compared to us.]]></description>
