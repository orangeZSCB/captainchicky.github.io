Yes.   The standard model of arithmetic is contained in every model of arithmetic, and this property characterizes it.  In other words, you can define &quot;standard model&quot; this way if you like.]]></description>

No, that&#039;s not right.   I certainly didn&#039;t say anything like that!

More or less by definition, the standard model is the smallest model of the Peano axioms for the natural numbers: it&#039;s contained in every other model.   I think this is the most accurate way of answering your question.   It&#039;s not so good to define &quot;standard number&quot; in terms of &quot;finite&quot; because then I have to ask what you mean by &quot;finite&quot;, and you might need to say &quot;standard&quot;.

I&#039;ve sort of been talking as if you know some mathematical logic, like what a first-order theory is, and what a model of such a theory is.   I think without knowing a bit about this it&#039;s very hard to get the idea of what a &quot;nonstandard model of Peano arithmetic&quot; is, or even what the &quot;standard&quot; model is.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Let me clarify that.

Within X alone, you might say &quot;7 is standard&quot; is meaningless, or you might say it&#039;s just another way of saying &quot;7 is a number&quot;.

When X is talking about 7 as a number in Y, it&#039;s not meaningless, but true by definition. Specifically, if X understands set theory, it defines the standard part of Y as the smallest subset of Y&#039;s numbers closed under successor. Whether or not it understands set theory, it defines &quot;the nth number of Y&quot; inductively using Y&#039;s 0 and successor, and then &quot;the standard part of Y&quot; is just the range of that map.

Now let&#039;s say another model Z is thinking about this whole situation including X and Y.

If X thinks Y is nonstandard, then necessarily, Z also thinks Y is nonstandard (unless Z thinks X is inconsistent or unsound, but let me ignore that possibility, which I am not sure I know how to speak precisely and correctly about). But Z may or may not think X is nonstandard.

If instead X thinks Y is standard, then Z might think both X and Y are standard, or it might think both X and Y are nonstandard.]]></description>

My take: no, that is not correct. &quot;standard&quot; or &quot;nonstandard&quot; is an adjective that one model can apply to another one, or to a number within another one. It has no meaning within a single model. If X says Y is nonstandard, that means X is saying &quot;I can see that Y contains extra numbers it doesn&#039;t need to&quot;. But Y itself implicitly thinks it needs everything it contains, and explicitly, it can&#039;t even frame the question.

This is different than saying &quot;maybe 0 = 1 has a proof, and if it does, our theory is inconsistent&quot;. 0 = 1 can at least be formulated (though we hope not proven) in our formal theory. But &quot;7 is nonstandard&quot; can&#039;t even be formulated.]]></description>

Okay, after digesting the conversation a bit, my understanding is now as follows.

It is not known whether the standard model only contains the natural numbers (those that you could actually get to by counting an unbounded-but-finite number of times). It is generally assumed but the proofs that exist assume the conclusion at least implicitly.

As to my question, if a smaller model were known to exist, the standard model would be known to contain &quot;extra&quot; numbers and could be considered nonstandard instead. The standard model could&#039;ve been shown to be the smallest possible, but only if the proof leaves open the question of extra numbers.

Does that sound about right?]]></description>

Right!

By the way, in his reply to this latest comment of yours, Bruce pointed out an important fact about nonstandard models, which is that working within a nonstandard model---as opposed to &quot;looking into it from outside&quot;---it&#039;s impossible to sharply distinguish between standard and nonstandard numbers!

The &lt;strong&gt;Overspill Theorem&lt;/strong&gt; says roughly that any formula you can write down in the language of arithmetic, that holds for arbitrarily large &lt;em&gt;standard&lt;/em&gt; numbers, must also hold for some &lt;em&gt;nonstandard&lt;/em&gt; ones.

The &lt;strong&gt;Underspill Theorem&lt;/strong&gt; says roughly that for any formula you can write down in the language of arithmetic, that holds for arbitrarily small &lt;em&gt;nonstandard&lt;/em&gt; numbers, must also hold for some &lt;em&gt;standard&lt;/em&gt; ones.

The combination of these results implies that there&#039;s no way in the language of arithmetic to write a formula that means &quot;n is standard&quot; or &quot;n is nonstandard&quot;.

So, suppose &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; model of the natural numbers is nonstandard.   Can you actually tell, &quot;from inside&quot;?]]></description>

That is correct.

Some limitations that still govern TM behavior, in spite of the &quot;apparent causal disconnect&quot; between their state at a step count of a standard number vs. a nonstandard number, can be proven using a principle from the study of nonstandard models that &quot;a cut is not definable&quot;. For example, can a machine which remembers a constant value in a register, have &quot;1&quot; in that register for all standard step counts, and &quot;2&quot; for all nonstandard ones? You might think so, because there is no case of step n and step n+1 where the register value changes between them. But you can prove this can&#039;t happen anyway, since if it did, it would allow you to define &quot;within the model&quot; the standard numbers, as the ones such that that register of that TM contains 1 after that many steps. That principle says this is impossible, since it would &quot;define a cut within the model&quot; (in this case, the set of the standard numbers). I confess I don&#039;t understand it much better than that --- e.g. it&#039;s hard or impossible for me to explain exactly &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; this is impossible, and yet other things remain possible, for a TM running in that model.]]></description>
