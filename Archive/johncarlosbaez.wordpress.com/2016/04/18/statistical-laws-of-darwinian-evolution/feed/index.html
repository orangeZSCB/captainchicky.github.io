Here&#039;s a nice paper about the mathematics of &quot;small N&quot;---that is, effects that happen when you&#039;ve got a small population:

&#8226; Marc Harper and Dashiell Fryer, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.01914&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Entropic equilibria selection of stationary extrema in finite populations&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Abstract.&lt;/strong&gt; We propose the entropy of random Markov trajectories originating and terminating at a state as a measure of the stability of a state of a Markov process. These entropies can be computed in terms of the entropy rates and stationary distributions of Markov processes. We apply this definition of stability to local maxima and minima of the stationary distribution of the Moran process with mutation and show that variations in population size, mutation rate, and strength of selection all affect the stability of the stationary extrema.

					<description><![CDATA[Re Fisher&#039;s Fundamental Theorem in its guise as the breeder&#039;s equation [ http://equation-of-the-month.blogspot.se/2011/01/fishers-fundamental-theorem-on-natural.html ; http://equation-of-the-month.blogspot.se/2013/04/the-breeders-equation_17.html ], I just found this interesting discussion on its application. It discusses how evolutionary biologists get around, or fail to get around, the differences between quantitative genetic variation (instantiated in the breeder&#039;s equation) and the adaptive potential (instantiated in the neutral variation).

It also discusses the failure of another &quot;law&quot;, the &quot;extinction vortex&quot; of small N. Turns out Fisher&#039;s FT/the breeder equation isn&#039;t very applicable to (at least some) small eukaryote populations, nor are models of adaptive potential or the adaptive potential itself.

Eukaryotes have a lot of tricks up theur sleeves, a &quot;capacity to colonize new habitats&quot;, a sometimes &quot;affinity for [localized] environments&quot;, and &quot;a partially duplicated genome which may act to buffer the loss of genetic diversity at small N&quot;. The upshot is that &quot;we very cautiously suggest that response to selection at small N might be more extensive than previously assumed in evolutionary and conservation biology.&quot;

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2016/04/18/statistical-laws-of-darwinian-evolution/#comment-79438&quot;&gt;Bruce Smith&lt;/a&gt;.

Evolutionary biologists have some words to help delineate the various aspects of evolution.   From Wikipedia:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microevolution&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Microevolution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is the change in allele frequencies that occurs over time within a population. This change is due to four different processes: mutation, selection (natural and artificial), gene flow, and genetic drift. This change happens over a relatively short (in evolutionary terms) amount of time compared to the changes termed &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroevolution&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&#039;macroevolution&#039;&lt;/a&gt; which is where greater differences in the population occur.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, as you might suspect, they argue a lot about these things, because there are lots of complexities and lots of ways to try to divide them into more manageable pieces.  They also talk about &#039;mesoevolution&#039;, e.g.:

&#8226;  Ehab Abouheif,  &lt;a href=&quot;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=3B6ED1347FE35D1CAF904C3C18D29E7C?doi=10.1.1.522.111&#038;rep=rep1&#038;type=pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Parallelism as the pattern and process of mesoevolution&lt;/a&gt;.

I heard a cool talk by a guy who wrote a book about a unified mathematical theory of micro- and mesoevolution, but now I can&#039;t remember his name!  I was very excited at the time, and wanted to learn more.  I think he was German.  &lt;img src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/emoticons/redface.gif&quot;/&gt;]]></description>

  That doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t try to understand each effect separately, in its own terms, does it?

Absolutely, simplification is very worthwhile. I&#039;m not criticizing it at all, just wanting to make sure I understand correctly exactly what was included and what was left out.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Considering that prokaryote growth rates can differ many orders of magnitude, I can see the advantages with such a simplified model, when more generally differential reproduction is the fitness measure.

Else there are some laws in population genetics that I have seen in my haphazard assimilation of the material. One is the use of Nash equilibrium for some allele frequencies. Another is the law that speciation happens if the crossbreeding rate between sub-populations is less than 1/generation on average, independent of population size. There is also the Hardy-Weinberg Law, the most hailed (and most controversial) of them all.

Speaking of the underlying population genetics, linasv has identified a complexity: if selection is too large during some time, a (finite) population can run out of variation capital, meaning random drift will increase.But we can always add complexity.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  the closer the initial distribution $latex p_0(x)$ to the normal, the later its relative entropy with respect to the normal  starts to increase. Why is this?&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since I haven&#039;t delved into the math (which is why I don&#039;t attempt the corresponding Lyapunov question), I can just guess based on dynamic intuition.

The finite fitness distribution should be closer in some sense to a single environmental factor behind the selective drive, since a normal distribution implies many factors. Hence it should converge faster on a solution that satisfies the environmental constraints.]]></description>
