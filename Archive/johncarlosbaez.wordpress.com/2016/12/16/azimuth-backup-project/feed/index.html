I talked to the person at the EarthCube booth when I was at the AGU early last month.  I told him that I didn&#039;t see anything in place on the web site and he agreed that there was nothing apart from architectural plans on how to get started. In other words, they are still looking for input from participants in the consortium.

One place to look for advice is the PO.DAAC site maintained by NASA JPL. What they do is store volumetric data of the ocean, which is really a huge amount of data.  I have worked with the maintainer of that site on another project and when I talked to him several years ago, he said most of his effort goes into maintenance of the data and making sure that users can read it with the available software. Once the data is stored, that&#039;s only the start of the effort.

I also talked to other JPL scientists at the AGU and they are doing interesting data mining work in conjunction with  this data.  So my take is that we continue to support NASA and tell our congress to continue to fund them.]]></description>

While the blockchain as a technology can be used to provide audit log for the data, I would still consider it as a technology, not the technology, until it has further developed and matured enough not to require the complete chain all the way back to the genesis block.


Message digests? Absolutely.
Digital signatures? Of course.
With timestamps? Certainly.
The blockchain? Why not, among others.


A sufficient level of trust does not require a mathematical proof of authenticity all the way back to the inception of any particular system.

Having reasonable guaranteed distributed widely enough in a decentralized fashion is enough. Future derivatives of the blockchain technology and similar should rely on sufficiently many verifiable sources, instead of requiring an absolute chain to an absolute origin, and everyone keeping a perfect record of all history until current point in time.

A mature system will allow for imperfect record and still work. Note that this can already be achieved to a reasonable level with message digests, digital signatures and timestamps alone, when widely deployed. Having a blockchain doesn&#039;t hurt, but shouldn&#039;t be considered a necessary part of the publication process. We can do 1-3 in any case, with and/or without 4.]]></description>

Mehmet,

I think there are two good reasons why this could be sticky.

First, scientists in government looking forward towards a hostile administration might reasonably want to rock-the-boat as little as possible to maximize their job retention prospects.  No one can properly fault them for having those concerns.

Second, it is important, as I have written elsewhere, that this effort not be too well publicly coordinated, because the effort itself could be subjected to denial-of-service attack, were details known.

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve emailed this to the Eric Holthaus personally (and he has acknowledged the issue has been forwarded to people who do security). There needs to be a movement from the horse&#039;s mouth (scientists or the gov sites) to put the SHA signatures into the blockchain.

This is the only way to prevent, verifiably and definitively any &quot;fake&quot; databases.

I don&#039;t know why this isn&#039;t being discussed more.]]></description>

Thanks - excellent!   You might consider contacting the folks who run that ftp site and getting them to make their own hash.  If they post that to a place that&#039;s backed up by the Internet Archive, your copy can be verified.

I hope you&#039;re reporting your progress to climatemirror.org - and if you want, you can also report it to the Azimuth Backup Project issue tracker:

https://bitbucket.org/azimuth-backup/azimuth-inventory/issues/

Take a look at some issues to see how we&#039;re doing this.]]></description>
