					<description><![CDATA[I want to get you involved in the &lt;b&gt;Azimuth Environmental Data Backup Project&lt;/b&gt;.  But first here&#039;s a post with some background.

Starting a few days ago, many scientists, librarians, archivists, computer geeks and environmental activists have started to make backups of US government environmental data.  We&#039;re trying to beat the January 20th deadline &lt;i&gt;just in case&lt;/i&gt; these backups are required.

Backing up data is always a good thing, so there&#039;s no point in arguing about politics or the likelihood that these backups are needed.  The present situation is just a nice reason to hurry up and do some things we should have been doing anyway.

As of 2 days ago the story looked like this:

• &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2016/12/13/saving-climate-data/&quot;&gt;Saving climate data (Part 1)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Azimuth&lt;/em&gt;, 13 December 2016.

A lot has happened since then, but much more needs to be done.]]></description>

Archiving is very good if you want to know the truth.  The fact that 1997, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ggweather.com/enso/oni.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;one of the biggest El Ni&#241;o years in recent history&lt;/a&gt;, had a higher global average temperature than 2005 is not a secret:

&lt;a href=&quot;http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ecological/gistemp_12_2016.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

1997 sticks up as a bump in this graph from &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;GISTEMP&lt;/a&gt;.  That&#039;s why you chose it to argue for global cooling.  That&#039;s called cherry-picking.  You can see it more clearly on the monthly averages:

&lt;a href=&quot;http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ecological/gistemp_2_2016.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

This graph ends on February 2016, another huge El Ni&#241;o spike.  But the overall trend is up.

I&#039;ll delete further global warming denial on this thread. I want to discuss ways of saving climate data.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Google have project to show to the public some access to image data, for example Google project art and Google books.
I think that these are project to allow the public to obtain free access to lots of data.
Having the software, the servers and storage space, it could be useful to use its resources to get the free distribution of scientific data (not only climate, not to alienate a political party) to create a reliable tool used by all the world&#039;s scientists: the gains are obtained from the number of the users, and would be a method to bring on its platforms other users, and some billionaire could finance the project.
I worried that it would be easy to attack not independent sources of data manipulation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Like Sage said, archiving is very bad when you want to change the past..

NOAA global report for 1997 stated that global avg for 1997 was 16.92C (62.45F) without much alarming language.

NOAA report for 2015 stated that global avg was 14.8 C which a lot of alarm in the report, 2C global cooling.. Inconvenient truth, let&#039;s hope this can be erased somehow..

There&#039;s a lot more data than the famous time series of global temperatures or even the larger amounts of temperature data those are based on.  There&#039;s carbon dioxide concentration data, sea ice data, sea level data, ocean pH and salinity data, air pollution data, hurricane data, etc. etc. etc.]]></description>
