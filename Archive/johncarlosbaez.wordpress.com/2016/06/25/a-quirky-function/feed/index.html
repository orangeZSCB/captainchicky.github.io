					<description><![CDATA[The thing about $latex x ^ y $, is that it&#039;s not even discontinious at 0^y.  What happens is seen by letting x approach 0, it goes up sharply at y -&#062; 0, and always passes through 1 at y=0.

Any line of the form x^ax (a sloping line) converges on 1 when x = 0, without dispute.

					<description><![CDATA[In my opinion, the right way to resolve this question is to say that the notation $latex x^y$ refers to &lt;em&gt;multiple distinct functions&lt;/em&gt;. These functions are:

$latex x^n$ where $latex n$ is a natural number and $latex x$ is an arbitrary complex number. This function is used to define polynomials and power series. With this function we must have $latex 0^0 = 1$ for the function to be well-behaved.

$latex x^i$ where $latex i$ is an integer and $latex x$ is a nonzero complex number.

$latex e^x$ where $latex x$ is a complex number is the exponential function. The $latex e$ at the bottom is just a symbol, though by abuse of notation some people define the number $latex e = e^1$, which makes this power compatible with other power functions.

$latex x^y = e^{y \log x}$ where $latex x$ is a positive real number and $latex y$ is a complex number. We can also extend this to be defined for any $latex x$ in a set where $latex \log x$ can be defined consistently, or even to all nonzero $latex x$ if we make this a multi-valued function. We can also extend the function continuously so that $latex 0^x = 0$ for all positive real numbers $latex x$. However, there is no way to extend this function continuously to (0,0), so with this function $latex 0^0$ is undefined.

These functions are frequently confused because in any point where two of them are defined, they give the same value. However, it is crucial to distinguish them when analyzing the expression $latex 0^0$: According to the first definition it is $latex 1$, but according to the rest it is undefined. Finally, applying this to your riddle, I must object to your solution as well: There is no single power function such that $latex 0^x$ looks like that.]]></description>

Consider multiplying repeatedly by $latex 0$. We can agree that $latex 0^2 = 0\times 0=0$. Then $latex 0^0\times 0 \times 0 = 0^2 = 0$. The trouble is, this equation will work for any value of $latex 0^0$. You don&#039;t run into this problem with repeated adding $latex 0$&#039;s. The only value that works for $0+0$ is $latex  0$.]]></description>

That does work.  And it looks like Matt Harden wrote it that way on G+.

If you ever need to write a URL with characters other than letters, numbers, dash, underscore, period or tilde (the &quot;unreserved characters&quot; in the table &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), and they aren&#039;t playing a role in the syntax of the URL (like a forward slash, a colon, or any of the other &quot;reserved characters&quot; listed in the same article), then the most robust way to write those characters is with a percent sign followed by two hexadecimal digits giving the character code.

You can even do this for characters with codes beyond the normal 8-bit range, but then you need to convert the code into UTF-8 and express it as multiple bytes.  This is a bit of a pain in the neck, and it can make some links to Wikipedia articles tedious to write, because they like using em-dashes and accented characters that can only be expressed this way.]]></description>

@David: that&#039;s the correct answer, but a much more conceptual derivation is possible. The determinant of a linear transformation $latex T : V \to V$ from a finite-dimensional vector space to itself is the scalar by which $latex T$ acts on the top exterior power of $latex V$, which is $latex 1$-dimensional. If $latex \dim V = 0$ then the top exterior power is the zeroth one, which is the unit (that is, the underlying field, as a $latex 1$-dimensional vector space), with $latex T$ acting by multiplication by $latex 1$.

A related but more concrete argument is that $latex 1$ is the unique answer consistent with cofactor expansion for a $latex 1 \times 1$ matrix.]]></description>

The horizontal arrows demarcate the first quadrant, that is, the region where $latex x &#062; 0$ and $latex y &#062; 0.$  You can see that the function being graphed, namely $latex x^y,$ equals zero along the $latex y$ axis, since $latex 0^y = 0$ for $latex y &#062; 0$.  And if you look harder you can see that it takes a constant positive value along the $latex x$ axis, consistent with the fact that $latex x^0 = 1$ for $latex x &#062; 0.$]]></description>
