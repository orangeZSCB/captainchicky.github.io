					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2016/06/11/azimuth-news-part-5/#comment-80845&quot;&gt;David Roberts&lt;/a&gt;.

I&#039;ve been going to Singapore since 2010.  My contract hasn&#039;t run out, but it seems like a good time to try something else.  My wife &lt;a href=&quot;http://complitforlang.ucr.edu/people/faculty/bio.html?page=raphals.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Lisa Raphals&lt;/a&gt; got a job offer from the Philosophy Department of the National University of Singapore sometime in 2009, and to explore that option I followed her and got a job at the Centre for Quantum Technologies.  (The math department thought I was too interested in physics; the physics department thought I was too interested in math.)  We took a 2-year leave of absence from U. C. Riverside from 2010 to 2012.  While we love a lot of things about Singapore, we also love our life in California, so we decided to come back and work in Singapore during the summers of 2013, 2014, 2015 and now 2016.

Next summer I&#039;m hoping we&#039;ll go to Erlangen, where Lisa has a connection the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ikgf.fau.de/people.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Internationales Kolleg f체r Geisteswissenschaftliche Forschung&lt;/a&gt;, which has a project on &quot;Schicksal, Freiheit und Prognose: Bew채ltigungsstrategien in Ostasien und Europa&quot;.  In other words: &quot;Fate, Freedom and Prognostication: Strategies for Coping with the Future in East Asia and Europe&quot;.  We spent the spring of 2014 in Erlangen, and it was great!  One reason is that it&#039;s so easy to visit colleagues throughout Europe: it&#039;s all so close.

In short: I follow my wife to interesting places and try to make the best of it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks, davetweed.  I don&#039;t know that my thing is quite amazing, but it is pretty darn cool.  Bumping it up to amazing is what the polishing is for.  ;)

Side note:  I will likely make the slides from my dissertation defense available in the near(ish) future.]]></description>
