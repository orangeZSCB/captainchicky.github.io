					<description><![CDATA[I am thinking that it should be interesting to create a virtual conference (with people who stay in many different universities, or at home), with speakers who see the audience like avatars on the screen, like seated in a virtual theater (by checking the attention requesting that the software verify that the the mouse is moved sometimes); with the possibility to chat with only neighbors (chosen to bring distant people closer), exchange messages, save the talks and save the slides, asks the speakers questions, vote for the speakers; it would be nice to exchange a few chats after the conference in a virtual hall for further information and contacts.
The cost of the conferences,  transports, restaurants and overnight would be reduced for universities increasing the research spending, and reducing the carbon emission of a conference; and all would be available to scholars, spreading knowledge.
A single, and simple, open source tools could be provided to all, with a test tool to verify that everything work before a conference.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2018/02/23/a-double-conference/#comment-107540&quot;&gt;Blake Stacey&lt;/a&gt;.

People keep saying that the problem with these nontraditional conference formats is that people can&#039;t chat informally, for example at lunch and dinner---this being one of the main things that makes conferences productive.

That&#039;s true!

And I keep advocating a hotel chain where people can have a conference in a room with video links to rooms in other branches of the chain.... featuring a &lt;em&gt;restaurant&lt;/em&gt; that has video booths where people can have dinner with someone at another branch. If you had a good video screen running the length of the table, the illusion of sharing a meal might be pretty good... though you couldn&#039;t ask someone to pass the salt.

I think we need to try things like this.]]></description>

That is indeed a neat idea. I&#039;m thinking that maybe one can extend the idea to each of the participants using their own network feed, and that would then cut the travel way down.]]></description>
