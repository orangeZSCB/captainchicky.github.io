					<description><![CDATA[&#039;Compositional tasking&#039; means assigning tasks to networks agents in such a way that you can connect or even overlay such tasked networks and get larger ones.  This lets you build up complex plans from smaller pieces.

In my &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2018/02/19/complex-adaptive-systems-part-7/&quot;&gt;last post in this series&lt;/a&gt;, I sketched an approach using &#039;commitment networks&#039;.   A commitment network is a graph where nodes represent agents and edges represent commitments, like &quot;A should move toward B either for 3 hours or until they meet, whichever comes first&quot;.  By overlaying such graphs we can build up commitment networks that describe complex plans of action.  The rules for overlaying incorporate &#039;automatic deconflicting&#039;.   In other words: don&#039;t need to worry about agents being given conflicting duties as you stack up plans... because you&#039;ve decided ahead of time what they should do in these situations.

I still like that approach, but we&#039;ve been asked to develop some ideas more closely connected to traditional methods of tasking, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_evaluation_and_review_technique&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;PERT charts&lt;/a&gt;, so now we&#039;ve done that.]]></description>

Thanks!  It should have been this:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  This lets us automate the process of filling in the details.  But we can&#039;t usually count on being able to do this.  So, often we may have to start with an element of $latex A$ and search for an element of $latex A&#039;$ that is mapped to it by $latex f : A&#039; \to A.$
