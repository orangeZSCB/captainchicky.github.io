					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2018/02/17/applied-category-theory-at-nist/#comment-112661&quot;&gt;Keith Harbaugh&lt;/a&gt;.

This was a workshop, not a conference, so it wasn&#039;t open to the public.  In fact, participants needed a badge and ID just to get through security and enter the National Institute of Standard and Technology!  They have a nuclear reactor there, and they&#039;re very security-conscious.  Perhaps for this reason, the organizers were not very interested in outreach.   I&#039;ve been trying to publicize it myself, since I feel part of the the point of any such gathering is to drum up enthusiasm and spread information.

The talks were videotaped, and the talk slides collected.  The organizers said all this material would probably be made public at some point.  If it is, I will tell the whole world about it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My thought: Why on earth is this conference not being publicized?  When I google  NIST Applied Category Theory: Bridging Theory &#038; Practice  your blogs are about the only references.  Sure seems like there should at least be the program announced on the web.  John, can you say anything about why this information isn&#039;t on the web?]]></description>

Now he&#039;s emphasizing that any in any topos E, there&#039;s a hypergraph category where the morphisms are relations: a relation $latex R : X \to Y$ is a map from $latex X \times Y$ to the subobject classifier $latex \Omega.$   This is most familiar when E = Set and the subobject classifier is the 2-element set {T,F}, but he wants to use a topos that incorporates time-dependence---and &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; is what he explained in detail in his talk at my workshop (see above).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Now Helle Hansen is talking about applications of coalgebras to Markov decision processes: &quot;Long-term values in MDPs, corecursively&quot;.   A paper:

&#8226; Frank M.V. Feys, Helle Hvid Hansen and Lawrence S. Moss, &lt;a href=&quot;https://homepage.tudelft.nl/c9d1n/papers/cmcs-2018.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Long-term values in Markov decision processes, (co)algebraically&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;em&gt;Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Science (CMCS 2018)&lt;/em&gt;.

A Markov decision process can be seen as a coalgebra of a certain functor.  The classical theory of these, not using coalgebras, is well-developed:

&#8226; M. L. Puterman, &lt;em&gt;Markov Decision Processes: Discrete Stochastic Dynamic Programming&lt;/em&gt;, John Wiley &#038; Sons, 2014.

However, many of the standard concepts can be nicely phrased in terms of &lt;em&gt;maps from a coalgebra of one functor to an algebra of another&lt;/em&gt;, a simple categorical concept I&#039;d never considered.]]></description>
