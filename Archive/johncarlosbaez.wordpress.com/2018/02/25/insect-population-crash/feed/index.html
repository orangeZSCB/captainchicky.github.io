					<description><![CDATA[I am thinking that it could be useful to do dna sequencing of some different species of insects in different years, so that the chemical, or environmental, cause could be found (maybe there is a collection for the different years).
Insect counteract environmental variables with the evolution of the species, and specific genes could be discovered for a specific function, and also the cause of the reduction of the bees population could be found.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Where red legged earth mites were once regularly controlled in early crops, this pest is no longer a problem.  Insect numbers have increased 600% with the changed management and have had a 125% increase in diversity.  I believe it is both this diversity in species (spiders and beneficials) that is controlling the red legged earth mites, as well as the change in nutrient availability to the crop.  The more balanced nutrition approach will mean a healthier, more robust plant which is more naturally resistant (and less attractive) to insect attack.&quot;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The German study does not rely on observations of splattered bugs on windshields.  As the article explains, people in Germany have been tracking insect abundances at about 100 sites since the 1980s, and they&#039;ve dropped over 75%.  I should have included a link to the actual research paper, and I will now, but here it is:

&#8226; Caspar A. Hallmann, Martin Sorg, Eelke Jongejans, Henk Siepel, Nick Hofland, Heinz Schwan, Werner Stenmans, Andreas Müller, Hubert Sumser, Thomas Hörren, Dave Goulson and Hans de Kroon, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;More than 75 percent decline over 27 years in total flying insect biomass in protected areas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt;, 18 October 2017.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Abstract.&lt;/strong&gt; Global declines in insects have sparked wide interest among scientists, politicians, and the general public. Loss of insect diversity and abundance is expected to provoke cascading effects on food webs and to jeopardize ecosystem services. Our understanding of the extent and underlying causes of this decline is based on the abundance of single species or taxonomic groups only, rather than changes in insect biomass which is more relevant for ecological functioning. Here, we used a standardized protocol to measure total insect biomass using Malaise traps, deployed over 27 years in 63 nature protection areas in Germany (96 unique location-year combinations) to infer on the status and trend of local entomofauna. Our analysis estimates a seasonal decline of 76%, and mid-summer decline of 82% in flying insect biomass over the 27 years of study. We show that this decline is apparent regardless of habitat type, while changes in weather, land use, and habitat characteristics cannot explain this overall decline. This yet unrecognized loss of insect biomass must be taken into account in evaluating declines in abundance of species depending on insects as a food source, and ecosystem functioning in the European landscape.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is an insect population crash.  The question is whether something similar is occurring in Australia.  Without systematic monitoring of insect populations, it&#039;s hard to get any evidence other than anecdotal evidence.  As the first article I quoted says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  At this stage, reports of insect population declines in Australia are only anecdotal.  And, without formal scientific research into the phenomena, Dr Webb said it was difficult to make accurate predictions or assessments about insect numbers. On the other hand, he said, it is important to listen to the entomologists, ecologists and researchers who are in the field on a regular basis.
  
  &quot;You get a feel for what the general insect populations are like when you&#039;re doing a lot of field work,&quot; he said.  &quot;I don&#039;t study cicadas, but I know what cicada numbers are like from year to year because I&#039;m out and about in my local wetlands.  &quot;When experts are relaying this kind of information it is something that we need to turn our mind to and think about what could be going on, and more importantly how do we work out if this is actually happening and what we do about it.&quot;

					<description><![CDATA[or maybe not...

&quot;At this stage, reports of insect population declines in Australia are only anecdotal.&quot;

umm... then use of the word &quot;crash&quot; in the alarmist repost headline is a bit hyperbolic don&#039;t you think? (I know, you also reference the Deutschland study, but there you have the quote &quot;Though observations about splattered bugs aren&#039;t scientific...&quot;.

Could it be natural variation? (vs. assuming / insinuating the &quot;human caused&quot; arguments). What is the &quot;natural&quot; level of variation - the statistical periodic swings used as the basis for comparison? (Kyr data please, akin to ice cores that show we are at 40k to 100k yr peak temp cycles in Natural global warming over millions of years)

Measuring insect populations in/around agriculture crops will guarantee human caused causation swings in BOTH directions. That may be unavoidable globally today, so care in making correlation vs. causation arguments are needed.

&quot;mix climate change and sea level rise &quot;... sea level rise? With even the most extreme measures of rise being posited, what would be the causation logic for the limited real rise today? (DUMBfounded is right)

The article seems to be making a &quot;we need to study this&quot; argument - that is great, keep studying it. But honesty (vs. alarmism) is better for making funding arguments for science in the long run. It keeps the pressure off for inserting statistical bias in causation arguments later.]]></description>
