From what I can tell, Statebox is using symmetric monoidal categories and other 1-categorical constructions.  They seem to be interested in proving that they&#039;re producing correct output, but not so much interested in the process of how they get there.

As John wrote above, I&#039;ve been working on modeling operational semantics with higher categories like Gph-enriched Lawvere theories and working on incorporating the higher-dimensional stuff into the type system.

The Pyr8 software was a project we worked on for a year before pivoting to work on cryptocurrency.  It was meant to run in datacenters, where the computers trust each other, as opposed to RChain, where everyone is mutually suspicious.]]></description>

Mike Stay replied:

RChain is an Ethereum competitor. It aims to fix several problems with Ethereum.

First, it will scale better: Ethereum currently runs every contract on every computer running a node, and insists on a total order on all transactions. RChain will have a notion of a rooted directed acyclic graph of regions in which contracts will run, a much finer-grained notion of transaction, and will only insist on a partial order for transactions: when they do not conflict, they can be in any order.

Second, Ethereum has no type system. This has led to bugs in various contracts and wallets. In June 2016, a buggy contract led to the theft of $50M in ETH from the DAO. The Ethereum community split into two parts: the first part insisted that &quot;code is law&quot; and that the hacker engaged in a series of perfectly valid transactions with the contract, so he was entitled to the ETH; the second part wanted human intervention to roll back a large transaction that was obviously a bug. They never reconciled, and &quot;Ethereum Classic&quot; forked off as a separate currency. Last year, someone exploited a bug in a Parity wallet and locked up $380M. Contracts are expressions of programmer intent, but programmers are human and make mistakes. Type systems allow programmers to write a kind of &quot;summary&quot; of their intent as a type. The compiler compares the two expressions and fails if they are not consistent. Greg Meredith (President of RChain) showed that one could have defended against the theft using a spatial-behavioral type system:

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sGlObhGhoEizBXC30Ww4h1KHKGkmcy4NiCKitIBqiUg/edit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Notes on the DAO re-entrancy bug and behavioral types&lt;/a&gt;.

Third, the Ethereum VM has suffered from various bugs (https://bounty.ethereum.org/) and relies on a find-and-patch system. RChain intends to formally verify as much of the platform as possible.

Last and probably least, Ethereum uses proof of work, which is basically proof of stake, but you&#039;re staking GPUs and ongoing electricity costs. RChain will use Vlad Zamfir&#039;s &quot;correct by construction&quot; proof of stake algorithm.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

Yes, both are pioneering the exciting new field of categorical distributed computation, but at the moment they are not yet closely related. Which is good, because it means they have a lot to learn from each other!

Statebox is just beginning development, while Pyrofex is fairly new as well; we are of course very interested in exploring possible connections and collaborations, but this will take time. Thank you for mentioning this.]]></description>
