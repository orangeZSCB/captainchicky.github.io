The organizers have collected the participants&#039; slides and I hope these will be made public.  Videos have been made of the  participants&#039; talks, and I hope and believe these will be made public.  Furthermore, there will eventually be a conference proceedings volume.

When something shows up, I&#039;ll let everyone know about it on this blog.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2018/09/12/noethers-theorem/#comment-130350&quot;&gt;Frederick Kintanar&lt;/a&gt;.

I&#039;m glad you liked my paper.  I&#039;m not sure how any of this relates to time-reversibility in the laws of classical mechanics---do you have anything specific in mind?   Note that in the formalisms I&#039;m describing, every observable $latex a$ generates a one-parameter group of symmetries $latex F_t^a,$ defined for all $latex t \in \mathbb{R},$ both positive and negative. In particular

$latex F_{-t}^a = (F_t^a)^{-1} $

so all these transformations are invertible.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  And what happens in complex vs. real and quaternionic quantum mechanics?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That&#039;s a long story.  I wrote a paper about it:

&#8226; John Baez, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1101.5690&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Division algebras and quantum theory&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Found. Phys.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;42&lt;/strong&gt; (2012), 819&#8211;855.

arguing that real, complex and quaternionic quantum mechanics are all part of unified structure that is actually &lt;em&gt;already being used&lt;/em&gt; in physics without people paying much attention to it.

My new paper will use Noether&#039;s theorem ideas to explain why the complex numbers are &#039;the first among equals&#039; in the trinity of associative normed division algebras.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The slides are very clear and quite interesting. They encourage me to try and work through your paper, when it comes out. Could you comment on how this relates to time-reversibility in the laws of classical mechanics? And what happens in complex vs. real and quaternionic quantum mechanics? I am hoping to gain insight into information flow in biological systems, where history intrudes in irreversible ways.]]></description>

Great - thanks!  That means a lot, since you&#039;re the kind of person I&#039;d like to communicate to, and I was worrying this presentation was too algebraic to really resonate with most such people&#8212;hence my self-deprecatory joke about the devil of algebra.]]></description>
