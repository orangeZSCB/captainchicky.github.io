Interesting.  The 5/8 theorem is so easy I feel Erdos and Turan &quot;could have&quot; noticed it if they bothered.  But I guess &quot;could have&quot; doesn&#039;t mean much in math.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think Erdos and Turan noticed the 5/8 upper bound (in print, anyway). They appear not to be interested.

					<description><![CDATA[So, here&#039;s a question I&#039;ve been wondering about along those lines.  You linked that paper of Sean Eberhard above, that proves that the set of commuting probabilities is reverse well-ordered.  I&#039;ve been wondering if it&#039;s possible to generalize this.  Like, say we pick an arbitrary word (in the free group F_n), and consider (for each finite group G) the probability that a random n-tuple satisfies this word.  So this theorem of Eberhard is the case when our word is aba^(-1)b^(-1).  For any word we choose, will the resulting set of probabilities be be reverse well-ordered too?

(This problem was basically inspired by recalling &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1102.4353&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; paper around the same time I first encountered Eberhard&#039;s paper above...)

The obvious place to start is words in one letter, so you&#039;re just counting elements of order dividing a fixed constant.  But I have no idea if that goes anywhere.  Like, it&#039;s known that any finite group with more than 3/4 of its elements being involutions must have all elements involutions, but who knows if that&#039;s the start of a well-ordering or not?  And that&#039;s just order 2!  There&#039;s some obvious trivial cases we can consider (the word &quot;a&quot;, for instance, or the identity word; or &quot;ab&quot;, or the analogue in any number of letters), and these aren&#039;t counterexamples but they don&#039;t tell us much of anything.

I&#039;ve also wondered what might happen if you allow compact groups instead of just finite groups.  Does that just add in 0, or is anything else gained?

Anyway, this is basically pure speculation on my part -- I don&#039;t actually intend to work on this problem.  But it&#039;s been bugging me all the same...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You wrote that you don&#039;t know the proof of the claim from Groupprops that having a commuting probability of 5/8 is equivalent to having inner automorphism group $latex \mathbb{Z}/2\times \mathbb{Z}/2$, but it&#039;s actually almost immediate from what you&#039;ve done here!

1) The inner automorphism group is, in general, $latex G/Z$, since $latex Z$ is exactly the kernel of the action of $latex G$ on itself by inner automorphisms. Thus inner automorphism group of order 4 $latex \Leftrightarrow$ $latex &#124;Z&#124;/&#124;G&#124; = 1/4$.

2) By the argument you gave, $latex G/Z$ is never cyclic, so having order 4 is the same thing as being $latex \mathbb{Z}/2\times\mathbb{Z}/2$.

3) In this situation, every $latex g\in G\setminus Z$ is noncentral, so its centralizer is not everything, but it properly contains $latex Z$, since it contains both $latex Z$ and $latex g\notin Z$. So the centralizer is a proper subgroup properly containing $latex Z$. It must have index 2 since $latex Z$ has index 4. Thus every element commutes with exactly half the other elements.]]></description>
