					<description><![CDATA[My former student Blake Pollard is working at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nist.gov/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;National Institute of Standards and Technology&lt;/a&gt;.  He&#039;s working with Spencer Breiner and Eswaran Subrahmanian, who are big advocates of using category theory to organize design and manufacturing processes.  In the spring of 2018 they had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2018/04/18/applied-category-theory-at-nist-part-2/&quot;&gt;workshop on applied category theory&lt;/a&gt; with a lot of honchos from industry and government in attendance---you can see videos by clicking the link.

This spring they&#039;re having another workshop on this topic!]]></description>

That&#039;s a good idea.  Actually Spencer Breiner should do it, since it&#039;s his workshop... but I&#039;ll be happy to get some of the fame and glory.  &lt;img src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/emoticons/tongue2.gif&quot;/&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[JB, thanks very, very much for posting this. What an intense experience those two days must have been! As the saying goes, &quot;Like drinking water from a fire hose.&quot; And thanks to the organizers and participants.  ---- Segueing to a slightly different topic, IMO a message to the Categories mailing list, with a link to http://www.appliedcategorytheory.org/nist-workshop-slides/ would be a very good idea. Would you be willing to post such a message? If for some reason you do not want to, I will see if Bob Rosebrugh would accept such a message from me, but it seems more appropriate for you to submit such a message. Thanks.]]></description>
