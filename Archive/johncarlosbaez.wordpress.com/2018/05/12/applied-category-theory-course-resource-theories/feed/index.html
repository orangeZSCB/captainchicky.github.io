					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll have too look at the puzzles but i&#039;ll make a comment first. Since i claim to have studied some economics , economists have 2 answers--one theoretical and one pragmatic.

Theoretically you can&#039;t ignore externalities---only problem is, in earlier and evolving forms of economics they sort of kept finding more externalities--things they neglected to account for (e.g. things like land, water, air, biodiversity, human capital or education, social capital (&#039;diversity and social in/exclusion) , etc. ).

Pragmatically, alot of economists decide to ignore externalities because it complicates the analyses, and complications incur costs--including computing time. You may have to truncate the series or algorithm (be a Turing oracle). So you may just put all the trash in the creek and it will be taken away to the ocean, rather than buy a trash can and make a dump or recycling center.

I rarely eat sweets anymore  so its hard for me to process the example--but its the same as any such process.

In statistical physics Jarzynski in/equality or Crooks fluctuation theorem (i view them as equivalent but that&#039;s an opinion) point out there are no externalities. My view is they formalized what had been folklore (i.e. well known knowledge, just as indigenous americans knew about potatoes before there were frito lay potato chips--they just didn&#039;t patent them). That view points out if you ask when entropy increases in a subsystem where did the negentropy go---the answer is out in the universe. Its still there. Thats the difference between the canonical and microcanonical ensembles in statphys.   In canonical there are externalities, in microcanonical there aren&#039;t any.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I believe it&#039;ll be fun to think about &quot;ignoring externalities&quot; and adjoints of monoidal monotones - I posted two puzzles about that here:

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.azimuthproject.org/discussion/2105/lecture-28-chapter-2-ignoring-externalities/p1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Lecture 28 - Chapter 2: Ignoring Externalities&lt;/a&gt;

The idea is that sometimes our view of a process:

is a simplification where we ignore features of a more complex process:

Can we go backwards and recover the more complex view from the simpler one?]]></description>

David Spivak helps run a software company, and he&#039;s gotten a large grant from NASA to help design certain aspects of the air traffic control system.  Does that count?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;we explore a wide variety of situations—in the world of science, engineering, and commerce&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, neither engineers, nor software developers, nor business leaders were consulted for or contributed to the development of the book.

Am I right?]]></description>
