That Lawvere &quot;got in trouble&quot; by espousing his political views is basically right and well-known, but the part about Lawvere teaching the history of mathematics &quot;without permission&quot; sounded  weird to me; I&#039;d never heard about that. I can see that something to that effect is mentioned in the Wikipedia article on Lawvere (not a very good one btw -- it doesn&#039;t give a proper idea of his immense influence), but I wasn&#039;t able to follow up on this because the crucial page in the book of Waite cited in the article is hidden from me. Can someone shed some light on the story there?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2018/05/19/circuits-bond-graphs-and-signal-flow-diagrams/#comment-120069&quot;&gt;Paul Pukite (@WHUT)&lt;/a&gt;.

I have the feeling bond graphs attract engineers who are seeking a broad universal formalism, more than engineers who focus on electrical systems.   Just as some physicists seek &quot;grand unified theories&quot; or &quot;theories of everything&quot; while other focus on specific humbler but perhaps more practical problems, some engineers seem drawn to grand syntheses---and those seem to be the ones who like bond graphs!  The titles of the textbooks I recommended hint at this:

• D. C. Karnopp, D. L. Margolis and R. C. Rosenberg, &lt;em&gt;System Dynamics: A Unified Approach&lt;/em&gt;, Wiley, New York, 1990.

• F. T. Brown, &lt;em&gt;Engineering System Dynamics: A Unified Graph-Centered Approach&lt;/em&gt;, Taylor and Francis, New York, 2007.

These are very good and very fun to read, but I&#039;m not sure they could convince an opponent that bond graphs are &quot;necessary&quot;.

That&#039;s okay.  I bumped into bond graphs when I was starting to attempt my own grand synthesis.   What I mainly like about them now is the process of &quot;doubled doubling&quot; that takes us from real numbers to &lt;em&gt;pairs&lt;/em&gt; of real numbers (e.g. the potential and current on a wire) to &lt;em&gt;pairs of pairs&lt;/em&gt; of real numbers (e.g. the potentials and currents on two wires).

The first doubling takes us into symplectic geometry, which is heavily discussed in &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/thesis_coya.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Brandon&#039;s thesis&lt;/a&gt; and also &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/thesis_fong.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Brendan&#039;s thesis&lt;/a&gt;.    Symplectic geometry arose in physics when it was realized that degrees of freedom come in pairs, e.g. position and momentum or potential and current.    There are lots of nice textbooks on symplectic geometry, and it sits near the heart of mathematical physics.

The second doubling is more mysterious and thus more interesting to me!   It shows up in electrical engineering in the fact that most apparatus has wires coming in pairs, each of which in turn carries a pair of variables: potential and current.  However, only the difference of potentials matters physically---this is the &quot;voltage&quot;---and the currents are constrained to be equal and opposite in most cases.  So, we get back down to two variables: this is called &quot;symplectic reduction&quot;.

There is much more to say about this, but I&#039;ll urge people to start by looking at Brandon&#039;s thesis!]]></description>

I got to know Andr&#233;e Ehresmann at a conference called &lt;a href=&quot;http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2014/4618/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Categories at the Crossroads&lt;/a&gt;, which I helped organize in 2014.  I subsequently met her at IRCAM, the electronic music laboratory in Paris---she&#039;s working with some people I know &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02249&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;applying categories to music theory&lt;/a&gt;.   But it&#039;s mainly conversations at that conference that helped me understand her theories.  As you say, she wants to build up descriptions of hierarchical structures as iterated colimits.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[JB, something I&#039;ve long been curious about:
To what extent have your circles (you certainly have a wide range of acquaintances and knowledge!) considered the 1987 article 
&quot;Hierarchical evolutive systems: A mathematical model for complex systems&quot; by Andree Ehresmann and J.P. Vanbremeersch
https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02459958
and its many successors, see
http://ehres.pagesperso-orange.fr/ and click on &quot;Publications&quot;.
As I understand it, Andree basically models complex systems as a hierarchy of colimits, which evolve over time.
Of course, in our systems both the requirements/specifications and the implementation are such, both evolve (hopefully in sync!).
Perhaps her papers might be of some relevance.
If you all this is answered somewhere, would you mind pointing me to it? Thanks very much.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;the diagrams engineers like to draw&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For electrical circuit diagrams (or schematics), it&#039;s not really a question as to whether engineers like to draw these, as they are an exact representation of the physical circuit, with all the wires represented by lines connecting the elements.

If no one drew the schematics (or currently, a net-list), nothing would be built.The equivalent for an architect would be a building blueprint.

On the other hand, bond graphs are a transformation of the physical circuit, and many electrical engineers will never see one of these during their college coursework.  Of course, the underlying equations for a circuit diagram and the equivalent bond graph are exactly the same. Some say the bond graph is more of a direct representation of the underlying equations.

I have heard that mechanical engineers may work with bond graphs more often, especially for hybrid electro-mechanical systems.

What would be interesting to see if bond graphs ever became popular in the circuit world.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very nice post but wayyy above my pay grade. I think i got an idea of what PROP means---&#039;products and permutations&#039; .

In set theory you just have products (multipication) and addition. In combinatorics you have permutations and combinations. 
  you can get alot of mathematical logic and statistical mechanics from those concepts.

I once met someone who studied under Lawvere (he gave me one of his papers on category thoery which i could barely understand --that was at a punk rock show)  .Lawvere also had interesting political views which got him in trouble. Mathematical biologists like Rashevsy and Rosen also were influenced by him.

Lawvere also got into trouble for teaching &#039;the history of mathematics&#039; without permission. V Arnold (of KAM theorem) had similar issues.

Gabriel Kron from 1940&#039;s some cite as a kind of original source of bond graph type ideas.(Wrote down Schrodinger equation as an electrcial circuit.) 
  From googling i see there is a website by F E Cellier with alot of stuff on bond graphs.
  Mayer in physical chemistry used &#039;cluster integrals&#039; or expansions which are similar to Feynman diagrams--except they are used for chemicals not quanta. .]]></description>
