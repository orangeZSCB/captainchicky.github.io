					<description><![CDATA[The very definition of Gibbs energy involving entropy, which depends for each reactant, on its concentration (or on its partial pressure for a gas), is it really the standard Gibbs energy of reaction $latex \Delta G^{\circ}$ that must be used in equation (1) for the calculation of rate constants? Such a standard quantity, if I&#039;m not wrong, is calculated considering all the reactants at a standard pressure, but it&#039;s not this way within the initial blend of reactants, isn&#039;t it? If so, it seems to me that the system of differential equations is not linear anymore.]]></description>

Thanks!   It sounds like there are some foundational issues I should look into!  Since these questions are old, and immensely practical, some smart people must have thought about them coherently.  So, I should find some chemistry textbooks that are good on conceptual issues, and see what they have to say!

Anyone have suggestions?]]></description>

On page 13, this effectively says that in practice, we use the mole per litre (or molar, M) as the unit, pretends that this solves the problem, and then admits that it doesn&amp;apos;t.

Looking through Wikipedia eventually brought me to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilibrium_constant#Dimensionality which says that the &lt;em&gt;concentration&lt;/em&gt; [X] should really be replaced by the &lt;em&gt;activity&lt;/em&gt; {X}, which is the concentration multiplied by an &lt;em&gt;activity coefficient&lt;/em&gt; γ(X).  Using the ratio of concentrations as the equilibrium constant is acceptable when you&amp;apos;re primarily interested in calculating concentrations, as long as the activity coefficient is constant, which (they say) it often is.  But for relating the equilibrium constant to free energy, you need to use the ratio of the activities directly.

Over on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activity_coefficient they say that the activity coefficient is basically just a fudge factor to account for deviations from ideal conditions; ideally, the activity coefficient is always 1.  This doesn&amp;apos;t fit with the previous article, which implied that the activity coefficient is dimensionful.  But the current article gives examples, which say that the activity is the activity coefficient times the &lt;em&gt;molar fraction&lt;/em&gt;, and the molar fraction is basically your ‘moles per mole of water’ suggestion.  (Actually, your suggestion is moles of X per moles of &lt;em&gt;solvent&lt;/em&gt;, while the actual definition is moles of X per moles of &lt;em&gt;solution&lt;/em&gt;, but these are usually approximately equal in practice.  The latter is more reasonable in principle, since it doesn&amp;apos;t require any assumptions about which of the other substances around are solutes and which are solvents.  That said, it&amp;apos;s not clear to me how much that matters if you&amp;apos;re going to throw in a correction for deviations from ideal conditions anyway.)

So in summary, while there are reasons to use [X] in practice, you need to use {X} to calculate free energy change, and {X} is roughly the molar fraction, which is roughly your suggestion.  However, I only reached this conclusion by combining two Wikipedia articles that don&amp;apos;t quite agree with each other and whose references I haven&amp;apos;t checked, so take it with a grain of salt.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Coupling is the way biology makes reactions that &#8216;want&#8217; to happen push forward desirable reactions that don&#8217;t want to happen. Coupling is achieved through the action of enzymes&#8212;but in a subtle way. An enzyme can increase the rate constant of a reaction. However, it cannot change the ratio of forward to reverse rate constants, since that is fixed by the difference of free energies, as we saw in Part 2: [&#8230;]]]></description>

Okay, there&#039;s a discussion of this issue starting on page 12 of these lecture slides:

I&#039;ll think about it.]]></description>

Hmm, good question!  Here&#039;s my initial thought.  Since the fundamental law

$latex 
\displaystyle{ \frac{\alpha_\to}{\alpha_\leftarrow} = e^{-\Delta {G^\circ}/RT} }  
$

only makes sense if the forward and reverse reaction rate constants have the same dimensions, they&#039;d better have the same dimensions.  So, people had better measure concentrations in a way that makes this happen!  I&#039;ll look and see what they do.  Perhaps &quot;moles per mole of water&quot; would work well for substances in aqueous solution, as we have in biology.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[How do we handle units/dimensions in these equations?  Everything&amp;apos;s fine if everything is dimensionless, but I measure dimensionful concentrations with units such as moles per litre.  Everything involving free energy is fine, and the rate equations are also fine if the rate constants are appropriately dimensionful, but then the two constants have different dimensions, so all of this talk of ratios of rate constants and whether one is larger than another doesn&amp;apos;t make sense.]]></description>
