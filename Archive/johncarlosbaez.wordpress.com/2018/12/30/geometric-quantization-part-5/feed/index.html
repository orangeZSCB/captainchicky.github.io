I could argue that once you get geometric quantization to cough up the irreducible representations of SU(2) as sections of equivariant line bundles over the sphere, you&#039;re done.  Then the Casimir will act as an operator on any of these irreducible representations, and it&#039;s bound to have the right eigenvalue: $latex j(j+1).$

But you seem to be wanting to see a sphere of radius $latex \sqrt{j(j+1)}$ pop out of the geometry, before you talk about any operators and their eigenvalues.  That would be cool, but I don&#039;t think that&#039;s going to happen.

This reminds me of some approach where the answer comes out to be $latex (j+\frac{1}{2})^2.$  The &lt;a href=&quot;https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Duflo+isomorphism&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Duflo isomorphism&lt;/a&gt; is an isomorphism of algebras going from the Ad-invariant part of the symmetric algebra of a Lie algebra to the center of its universal enveloping algebra, and we can use this to quantize the Casimir of SU(2) and get

$latex (j+\frac{1}{2})^2 = j(j+1) + \frac{1}{4} $

this is tantalizingly close to being &#039;correct&#039;.

It might be easier to get a sphere of radius $latex j + \frac{1}{2}$ to come out of geometric quantization than a sphere of radius $latex \sqrt{j(j+1)}.$    Then the slight error could be a source of lifelong frustration.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Classically, if we take a vector of length 1/2 in $latex \mathbb{R}^3$ and &lt;i&gt;triple&lt;/i&gt; it we get a vector of length 3/2.  This gives a map from classical states of the spin-1/2 particle to classical states of the spin-3/2 particle.  In other words: a map from the sphere of radius 1/2 to the sphere of radius 3/2.  Simple!  But this is not a symplectic map, since as we saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2018/12/30/geometric-quantization-part-5/&quot;&gt;last time&lt;/a&gt;, we are giving the latter sphere a symplectic structure that&#039;s 3 times as big.

I realize I was misreading your question, which is not about generalizing the ambient projective space to a different ambient $latex G/P$, but about what the physics should be associated to $latex G/P$ as a phase space.

I think the easiest point of view is to see $latex G/P = K/L$ as a symplectic reduction of $latex T^* K$, where $latex K$ is the maximal compact of $latex G$ complex (so $latex G$ is $latex K$&#039;s complexification). Start with a free particle traveling on $latex K$. By using the left or right $latex K$-action to move the particle back to the origin, one can derive two $latex \mathfrak k$-valued &quot;momentum vectors&quot;, and from there, take their $latex K$-invariant functions. (The $latex K$-invariants of the left $latex \mathfrak k$-momentum determine those of the right one, and vice versa, a classical version of the Peter-Weyl theorem.)

If you fix the value of these invariants (constant on the $latex K\times K$-orbits), you get a subset of the phase space $latex T^* K$, which you can then divide by the right $latex K$-action. I&#039;m not sure how best to describe the resulting phase space physically, other than as a free particle on $latex K$, with a fixed kind of momentum, up to the right action.

The dumbest example would be about a free particle on the round $latex 3$-sphere in $latex \mathbb R^4$. It&#039;s got a $latex 4$-momentum, an antisymmetric $latex 4\times 4$-matrix. The $latex SO(4)$-invariant momentum to compute here (note that $latex S^3\times S^3 \twoheadrightarrow SO(4)$!) is the kinetic energy $latex &#124;\vec v&#124;^2$. So assume the energy is fixed, use the right $latex S^3 = SU(2)$ action to move the particle back to the origin $latex e$, and the remaining freedom is a point in $latex T^*_e(S^3)$ with fixed $latex &#124;\vec v&#124;^2$.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2018/12/30/geometric-quantization-part-5/#comment-140125&quot;&gt;John Baez&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi Alex. One thing you might be asking is, if John is studying subvarieties of projective space, why would someone else be studying subvarieties of other $latex G/P$, in particular other Grassmannians?

The simplest answer to that is, projective spaces (all put together) are the classifying space for line bundles, whereas $latex k$-Grassmannians (all put together) are the classifying space for $latex k$-plane bundles.

I don&#039;t know how to make that desirable to a classical mechanic. On a line bundle, we can put a connection, take its curvature, and get a (possibly) symplectic $latex 2$-form. On a $latex k$-plane bundle, we can put a connection, take all its Chern-Weil forms, and get lots more forms. But I don&#039;t know whether a physicist would say &quot;hey, my phase space actually had all these other $latex 2j$-forms on it, that I didn&#039;t know what to do with.&quot;

Alternately, if $latex M$ carries a $latex k$-plane bundle $latex \mathcal V$, we can look at the antitautological bundle $latex \mathcal O(1)$ on $latex \mathbb P \mathcal V$, push it down to $latex M$, and get $latex \mathcal V$. So in that sense, we can work with the projectively embedded $latex \mathbb P\mathcal V$ instead of the Grassmannianly embedded $latex M$.

<p>Hi Alex. One thing you might be asking is, if John is studying subvarieties of projective space, why would someone else be studying subvarieties of other <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G%2FP&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="G/P" class="latex" />, in particular other Grassmannians?</p>
<p>The simplest answer to that is, projective spaces (all put together) are the classifying space for line bundles, whereas <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" />-Grassmannians (all put together) are the classifying space for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" />-plane bundles.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how to make that desirable to a classical mechanic. On a line bundle, we can put a connection, take its curvature, and get a (possibly) symplectic <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="2" class="latex" />-form. On a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" />-plane bundle, we can put a connection, take all its Chern-Weil forms, and get lots more forms. But I don&#8217;t know whether a physicist would say &#8220;hey, my phase space actually had all these other <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2j&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="2j" class="latex" />-forms on it, that I didn&#8217;t know what to do with.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alternately, if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="M" class="latex" /> carries a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" />-plane bundle <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal+V&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathcal V" class="latex" />, we can look at the antitautological bundle <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal+O%281%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathcal O(1)" class="latex" /> on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+P+%5Cmathcal+V&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb P &#92;mathcal V" class="latex" />, push it down to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="M" class="latex" />, and get <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal+V&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathcal V" class="latex" />. So in that sense, we can work with the projectively embedded <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+P%5Cmathcal+V&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb P&#92;mathcal V" class="latex" /> instead of the Grassmannianly embedded <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="M" class="latex" />. At that point, the physicist&#8217;s question becomes &#8220;is my phase space actually a projective bundle over something smaller, and maybe that&#8217;s the right space to work with instead&#8221;? Again, I don&#8217;t really know examples of that.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Regarding the prefactor of $latex j$ instead of $latex j^2$ in the symplectic form $latex \omega$, a physicist&#039;s low-brow way of seeing it is to recall the angular variable $latex \phi$ and the angular momentum $latex L_z = j\cos\theta$ form canonical conjugate pair, and hence the prefactor of $latex j$.

I am one of those physicists who did hear about the classical spin-$latex j$ particle though I&#039;ve never learned symplectic geometry. A few years back, I found an interesting connection, perhaps well known among mathematicians, between the classical spin-$latex j$ particle and George Marsaglia&#039;s method of picking random points in $latex S^2$ with uniform probability density. In the latter, Marsaglia employed the following transformation: $latex x = 2x_1\sqrt{1-x^2_1-x^2_2}$,  $latex x = 2x_1\sqrt{1-x^2_1-x^2_2}$, $latex y = 2x_2\sqrt{1-x^2_1-x^2_2}$, and $latex z = 1-2(x^2_1+x^2_2)$, where $latex (x,y,z)$ are Cartesian coordinates of a point on $latex S^2$, and $latex (x_1,x_2)$ are Cartesian coordinates of a point on a unit disk. This transformation is a symplectic map and thus volume preserving. It then follows that a uniform probability density on the unit disk, through this transformation, generates a uniform probability distribution on $latex S^2$.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2018/12/30/geometric-quantization-part-5/#comment-140116&quot;&gt;Alexander Heaton&lt;/a&gt;.

Your questions are not naive at all.  Mostly you&#039;re raising issues that I&#039;d love to talk about in future posts if I have time.  (The range of issues I&#039;d like to discuss keeps expanding faster than I can write.)

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  One question is about G/P and the corresponding geometric objects, how do they fit into this picture? For example, in Lie type A we have G/B where B is the stabilizer subgroup of a full flag. Then with partial flags we obtain various G/P. These can be interpreted as specifying certain geometric figures and their incidence relations within projective geometry. All of these G/P are projective varieties and so we can apply the functor you defined.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I should probably explain for those not in the know.  Here $latex G$ is a complex simple Lie group, $latex B$ is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borel_subgroup&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Borel subgroup&lt;/a&gt;, and $latex P$ is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borel_subgroup#Parabolic_subgroups&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;parabolic subgroup&lt;/a&gt;.   The spaces $latex G/P$ are known as as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_flag_variety&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;generalized flag varieties&lt;/a&gt;.  They are compact manifolds, but there are well-known ways to put K&#228;hler structures and compatible line bundles on them, so we can hit them with K&#228;hler quantization---and by varying our choice of $latex P$ and the extra data, we can get all the irreducible representations of $latex G$ this way!

The buzzword for this whole network of ideas is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borel%E2%80%93Weil%E2%80%93Bott_theorem&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&#039;Borel--Weil--Bott theorem&#039;&lt;/a&gt;, and all mathematicians should learn this stuff.

As you note, when $latex G$ is of type $latex \mathrm{A}$ (that is, $latex \mathrm{SL}(n,\mathbb{C})$ for some &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;), these generalized flag varieties $latex G/P$ are spaces of &#039;figures&#039; like points, lines, planes, etc. in projective geometry.   When $latex G$ is of some other type, these generalized flag varieties are spaces of figures in other kinds of geometry, like &#060; a href = &quot;https://cameroncounts.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/pps1.pdf&quot;&#062;&#039;polar geometry&#039;.   This is a whole huge fascinating story in itself.  But what it means for us here is that all these kinds of geometry can be quantized!

What does that actually &lt;i&gt;mean?&lt;/i&gt;   I&#039;m not completely sure except in examples like $latex G = \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C}),$ where quantized incidence geometry plays a big role in &#039;loop quantum gravity&#039; and &#039;spin foam models&#039;---attempts to study geometry quantum-mechanically.  It would be fun to generalize those ideas to other groups in a very systematic way.

Today I just did the smallest bit of this enormous story, taking $latex G = \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$, taking $latex P = B$ to be the subgroup of upper triangular matrices in $latex \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C}),$ and getting $latex G/B = \mathbb{C}\mathrm{P}^1.$

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  Another question I had concerned varying the projective embeddings. For the Grassmannian we have the Pl&#168;cker embedding, and this suggests considering taking various exterior powers and then projectivizing, to obtain other projective embeddings.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the end of this post I mentioned that next time I&#039;d be quantizing the spin-&lt;i&gt;j&lt;/i&gt; particle for &lt;i&gt;j&lt;/i&gt; &#062; 1/2 by looking at embeddings of $latex \mathbb{C}\mathrm{P}^1$ in higher-dimensional projective spaces.   This is a bit like what you&#039;re talking about.  Maybe later we can look at other examples.  Right now I&#039;m mainly interested in examples that give me ideas about physics, but probably &lt;i&gt;every&lt;/i&gt; example would give me ideas about physics if I were smart enough.

I feel I didn&#039;t really answer your questions, but that&#039;s probably because I think it&#039;s the most fun to look at specific examples and draw conclusions from what happens, and I plan to do more of that in future posts. Stay tuned!]]></description>

<p>At the end of this post I mentioned that next time I&#8217;d be quantizing the spin-<i>j</i> particle for <i>j</i> &gt; 1/2 by looking at embeddings of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BC%7D%5Cmathrm%7BP%7D%5E1&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{C}&#92;mathrm{P}^1" class="latex" /> in higher-dimensional projective spaces.   This is a bit like what you&#8217;re talking about.  Maybe later we can look at other examples.  Right now I&#8217;m mainly interested in examples that give me ideas about physics, but probably <i>every</i> example would give me ideas about physics if I were smart enough.</p>
<p>I feel I didn&#8217;t really answer your questions, but that&#8217;s probably because I think it&#8217;s the most fun to look at specific examples and draw conclusions from what happens, and I plan to do more of that in future posts. Stay tuned!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This has been a great series of posts that leads to a lot of interesting questions. I&#039;m still a grad student so maybe you&#039;ll forgive any naive ones.

One question is about G/P and the corresponding geometric objects, how do they fit into this picture? For example, in Lie type A we have G/B where B is the stabilizer subgroup of a full flag. Then with partial flags we obtain various G/P. These can be interpreted as specifying certain geometric figures and their incidence relations within projective geometry. All of these G/P are projective varieties and so we can apply the functor you defined. But what happens in other types? And, in both type A and other types how do the geometric objects correspond to aspects of the quantized systems?

Another question I had concerned varying the projective embeddings. For the Grassmannian we have the Plucker embedding, and this suggests considering taking various exterior powers and then projectivizing, to obtain other projective embeddings. You already mentioned that the cartesian product of vector spaces comes with the Segre embedding into the tensor product. Are there any other sources of projective embeddings to keep in mind? As we change our projective embedding, what properties of the quantized system change and how?

Again, thanks for the posts, I think they have helped my understanding a lot and even better raise interesting questions to think about!]]></description>
