&lt;blockquote&gt;
The only problem is, (I’ve read the descriptions in all of these places and still) I don’t understand what contact geometry is supposed to be.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Symplectic geometry is easiest to understand if you think of it as a generalization of the geometry that any cotangent bundle has---that is, the geometry of position-momentum pairs.

Similarly, contact geometry is easiest to understand if you think of it as a generalization of the geometry that the trivial circle bundle over the cotangent bundle has---that is, the geometry of position-momentum-phase triples.  This space is what we &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; should call &quot;phase space&quot;!  Yes, phases are important in classical mechanics too.

I see that I explained this more carefully here &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2018/12/26/geometric-quantization-part-2/#comment-139892&quot;&gt;3 years ago&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Why would anyone want such a thing—in particular, why do we specifically care about “metric” symplectic geometry in the even-dimensional case but “conformal” contact geometry in the odd-dimensional case?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hmm, maybe because &lt;i&gt;another&lt;/i&gt; motivating example of a contact manifold is the projectivized cotangent bundle.  The symplectic structure on the cotangent bundle puts a &quot;nondegenerate 2-form up to an undetermined scale factor&quot; on this.

So, starting from the cotangent bundle there&#039;s a nice way to get a manifold of dimension one more (the circle bundle over it) and and a manifold of dimension one less (its projectivization), both of which are contact manifolds.  There&#039;s more about the seccond constructon here, but apparently not the first:

They also mention a third: a surface of constant energy in a cotangent bundle can sometimes be made into a contact manifold.]]></description>

Arnold talked a lot about contact geometry and its connections with classical mechanics, thermodynamics, optics and Hamilton–Jacobi, so it’s probably in there somewhere.

If I understood contact manifolds, I’d probably find the relevant parts in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.springer.com/gp/book/97803879689020&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mathematical methods of classical mechanics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; appendix 4, “Contact structures”. Other places he talks about contact manifolds are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387966496&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Geometric methods in the theory of ordinary differential equations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; §8, “The non-linear first-order partial differential equation”; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783540404484&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lectures on partial differential equations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; lecture 4, “Huygens’ principle in the theory of wave propagation”; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bookstore.ams.org/ulect-5&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Topological invariants of plane curves and caustics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; lecture 2, “Symplectic and contact topology of caustics and wave fronts”.

The only problem is, (I’ve read the descriptions in all of these places and still) I don’t understand what contact geometry is supposed to be.

If I look for something “flat” (linear-algebraic) that contact geometry is supposed to be the “curved” (differential-geometric) version of, the best I can do is that it is… a conformal (up-to-scalar-factor) geometry of maximal-rank antisymmetric bilinear forms in odd dimension? Why would anyone want such a thing—in particular, why do we specifically care about “metric” symplectic geometry in the even-dimensional case but “conformal” contact geometry in the odd-dimensional case?]]></description>

I spent several years trying to support the same technology that you see at the nCafé on WordPress. Eventually, I abandoned the effort because the WordPress codebase was too unbearably crappy to make the cost/benefit worthwhile.

MathJax (which, of course, we use to support browsers without native MathML support) may not be great, but it&#039;s &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; better than crappy little GIF images.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2018/12/26/geometric-quantization-part-2/#comment-139948&quot;&gt;Todd Trimble&lt;/a&gt;.

Yes.  In this article (okay, post) I explained the concept of a Chern connection:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

2) We can demand that the connection $latex D$ be compatible with the holomorphic structure of $latex L.$   Let me spell this out a little.   Since $latex L$ is a holomorphic line bundle there&#039;s a $latex \overline{\partial}$ operator that we can apply to any section of $latex L$ and get an $latex L$-valued 1-form.  This is an $latex L$-valued (0,1)-form, meaning that written out in holomorphic complex coordinates $latex z^i$ it has $latex d \overline{z}^i$ terms but no $latex dz^i$ terms.  On the other had, we can use the connection $latex D$ to take the covariant derivative of $latex s,$ which is a $latex L$-valued 1-form $latex D s,$ and take its (0,1) part, denoted $latex \pi_{0,1} D s.$    Then, we can demand that these agree:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
$latex \overline{\partial} s = \pi_{0,1} D s$
&lt;/div&gt;

3) We can demand that the connection $latex D$ be &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermitian_connection&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;hermitian&lt;/a&gt;.  This means that the directional derivative of the inner product of two sections of $latex L$ can be computed using a kind of product rule where we differentiate each section using $latex D.$  Namely:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
$latex v \langle s, t \rangle = \langle D_v s, t \rangle + \langle s, D_v t \rangle$

Any holomorphic hermitian line bundle has a unique connection obeying 2) and 3).  This is called the &lt;b&gt;Chern connection&lt;/b&gt; and its construction is actually given here:

<p>Yes.  In this article (okay, post) I explained the concept of a Chern connection:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2) We can demand that the connection <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="D" class="latex" /> be compatible with the holomorphic structure of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="L." class="latex" />   Let me spell this out a little.   Since <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="L" class="latex" /> is a holomorphic line bundle there&#8217;s a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7B%5Cpartial%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;overline{&#92;partial}" class="latex" /> operator that we can apply to any section of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="L" class="latex" /> and get an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="L" class="latex" />-valued 1-form.  This is an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="L" class="latex" />-valued (0,1)-form, meaning that written out in holomorphic complex coordinates <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z%5Ei&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="z^i" class="latex" /> it has <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d+%5Coverline%7Bz%7D%5Ei&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="d &#92;overline{z}^i" class="latex" /> terms but no <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=dz%5Ei&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="dz^i" class="latex" /> terms.  On the other had, we can use the connection <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="D" class="latex" /> to take the covariant derivative of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="s," class="latex" /> which is a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="L" class="latex" />-valued 1-form <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D+s%2C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="D s," class="latex" /> and take its (0,1) part, denoted <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi_%7B0%2C1%7D+D+s.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;pi_{0,1} D s." class="latex" />    Then, we can demand that these agree:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7B%5Cpartial%7D+s+%3D+%5Cpi_%7B0%2C1%7D+D+s&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;overline{&#92;partial} s = &#92;pi_{0,1} D s" class="latex" />
</div>
<p>3) We can demand that the connection <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="D" class="latex" /> be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermitian_connection" rel="nofollow">hermitian</a>.  This means that the directional derivative of the inner product of two sections of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="L" class="latex" /> can be computed using a kind of product rule where we differentiate each section using <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D.&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="D." class="latex" />  Namely:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v+%5Clangle+s%2C+t+%5Crangle+%3D+%5Clangle+D_v+s%2C+t+%5Crangle+%2B+%5Clangle+s%2C+D_v+t+%5Crangle&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="v &#92;langle s, t &#92;rangle = &#92;langle D_v s, t &#92;rangle + &#92;langle s, D_v t &#92;rangle" class="latex" />
</div>
