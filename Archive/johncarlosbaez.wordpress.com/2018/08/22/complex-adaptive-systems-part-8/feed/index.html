No, I have not seen these tools.  Thanks!   Other people on the team have their feet more firmly on the ground when it comes to software; I have a lot to learn.

Unfortunately Wordpress blogs have a tendency to eat and spit out certain kinds of images in comments before they even reach me.  So I can&#039;t restore the images to your comment, but I think if you simply tell me the URL for a jpg or gif I can insert it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[John, have you encountered Design Design Structure Matrix? This is a process of connecting all the members of a network in a structure that can be used to model the processes. There is also a tool from Rockwell Automation that can model the stochastic processes taking place between the nodes of the network  Glen B. Alleman, MSSM Here’s an example on a spacecraft 

and the network model it produces 

Arena is a discrete event simulation tool used to model the interaction and propagation of risk (in this example) using a network model of how these risk are structured in a program. https://www.arenasimulation.com/  is the Rockwell Automation site for the Arena application.
