					<description><![CDATA[This talk on structured cospans and Petri nets is the second of a two-part series, but it should be understandable on its own.  The first part is on &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2020/03/31/structured-cospans-and-double-categories/&quot;&gt;structured cospans and double categories&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;strong&gt; Structured cospans and Petri nets&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Abstract.&lt;/strong&gt; “Structured cospans” are a general way to study networks with inputs and outputs. Here we illustrate this using a type of network popular in theoretical computer science: Petri nets. An “open” Petri net is one with certain places designated as inputs and outputs. We can compose open Petri nets by gluing the outputs of one to the inputs of another. Using the formalism of structured cospans, open Petri nets can be treated as morphisms of a symmetric monoidal category---or better, a symmetric monoidal double category. We explain two forms of semantics for open Petri nets using symmetric monoidal double functors out of this double category. The first, an operational semantics, gives for each open Petri net a category whose morphisms are the processes that this net can carry out. The second, a “reachability” semantics, simply says what these processes can accomplish.  This is joint work with Kenny Courser and Jade Master.&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wonder if this is relevant to reasoning about dropping grains of sand on an Abelian sandpile. Ie could it show that all points on lattice are reachable from dropping grains on a single tile repeatedly, or more interestingly, would it be able to tell you things about interference patterns caused by dropping grains at two points separated by n cells simultaneously, etc. Would it cause an problem in applying these techniques if the lattice is infinite instead of a finite number of cells?]]></description>

If reachability is our only concern, then certainly we can ignore self loops. But if thermodynamics is of any concern, self loops are a way to model a thermodynamic engine. In a factory, the engine doesn&#039;t start when you put a part in the input queuing place to a transition that models a machine. The thermodynamic engine starts when you put a token in the &quot;self&quot; place. To stop the thermodynamic engine, remove the token from the &quot;self&quot; place. Regarding chemistry, that might be of interest for models of biological systems, which involve thermodynamics.]]></description>

Okay, good.  I&#039;ve added my explanation to the blog post to make it clearer.

(I&#039;m saying this so nobody wonders why you needed to have it explained twice.  &lt;img src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/emoticons/tongue2.gif&quot;/&gt;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2018/08/18/open-petri-nets-part-2/#comment-126823&quot;&gt;Toby Bartels&lt;/a&gt;.

I should have written $latex \blacksquare Q \circ \blacksquare P \subseteq \blacksquare ( Q \circ P ).$   I&#039;ll fix that&#8212;thanks!   I hope I didn&#039;t get it twisted around in the actual paper.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  Also, shouldn&#039;t the chemistry diagrams have some nodes with more than mark in them? Not in the original diagram, but in the later ones, if each is supposed to be reachable from the previous one.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I don&#039;t think so.  We start with one atom of carbon, one molecule of oxygen, one molecule of sodium hydroxide and one molecule of hydrochloric acid:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img width=&quot;250&quot; src=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/chemistryNetDot1A.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

They turn into one molecule of carbon dioxide, one molecule of sodium hydroxide and one molecule of hydrochloric acid:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img width=&quot;250&quot; src=&quot;http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/files/chemistryNetDot2A.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

These turn into one molecule of sodium bicarbonate and one molecule of hydrochloric acid:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img width=&quot;250&quot; src=&quot;http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/files/chemistryNetDot3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

These turn into one molecule of carbon dioxide, one molecule of water and one molecule of sodium chloride:

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img width=&quot;250&quot; src=&quot;http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/files/chemistryNetDot4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

So, there&#039;s always at most one token in each place in this story.   That&#039;s not true for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; such stories, so this example is unrepresentative, but I think I&#039;ve got the chemistry basically right: atoms of each kind are being conserved.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Unless I misunderstand reachability (which is quite possible), then the laxness should be $latex \blacksquare Q \circ \blacksquare P \subseteq \blacksquare ( Q \circ P ) $, rather than the other way around.  That is, if something&amp;apos;s reachable by going through $latex Q $ after going through $latex P $, then it&amp;apos;s reachable by going through $latex Q \circ P $, but additional zigzag reachings may also exist in $latex \blacksquare ( Q \circ P ) $.

					<description><![CDATA[How would you analyze a &quot;self&quot; loop, where an arrow from a transition goes to a place (self) thence back to the originating transition-- with other arrows possible? (I had to do that once when simulating a factory system using diagrams of Petri nets automatically coded into Smalltalk80.
