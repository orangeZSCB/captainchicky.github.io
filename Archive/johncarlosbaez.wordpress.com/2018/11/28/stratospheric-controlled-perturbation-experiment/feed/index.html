&lt;blockquote&gt; ... many Christians believed in the literal resurrection of the body on Judgement Day, and thought that messing with dead bodies would impair ... &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yes, this was inherited, acknowledged or not, from their Jewish forebears. Even though they&#039;ve lost of bunch of these opinions, there remain many Jewish practices which hark back to a more primitive relationship with the universe.  For example, unlike Christian cemeteries, Jewish ones have much wider spaces between rows, so people do not need to walk on top of graves. Similarly, returning from the graveyard, the pitcher of water outside and towel is intended to wash &quot;death&quot; off the hands.  Ditto covering of mirrors with clothes, based upon the thought that, at moments of transition between life and death, the living are more susceptible to having their souls stolen. Finally, the accompanying of a dead body from the moment of death until burial.

We &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; laugh at these -- I&#039;m not saying anyone here would -- but these all come from a perspective of the universe which is much more haunting than now. Indeed, part of Sagan&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17349.The_Demon_Haunted_World&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Demon Haunted World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is how, with the loss of appreciation for Science and Mathematics, we might be returning to that spooky time.

Let me give a modern example. Many progressive environmentalists eschew plastic in all its forms, championing, for instance, unconditional plastic bag bans. No doubt, use of disposable bags, plastic and paper, is a bad thing, &lt;em&gt;as long as reusable bags are used some large minimum of times&lt;/em&gt;. But, then, despite efforts to convince people quantitatively of the harm of paper bags and their manufacture, which includes upstream wastes and chemistry in many forms, as well as sourcing original paper, in most instances (not, for the latter, at &lt;em&gt;Whole Foods&lt;/em&gt;), and the relative cheapness of hauling a million plastic bags in one trip to a store, paper bags are embraced because they are intrinsically &quot;more natural&quot;. It&#039;s as if plastic were a demon spirit and people want to exorcise it.]]></description>

Okay.  The analogy seems a bit funny because messing with one person seems like so much less of a big deal than messing with the planet.  But I guess it helps to remember that back then many Christians believed in the literal resurrection of the body on Judgement Day, and thought that messing with dead bodies would impair their ability to be properly resurrected.   (At least that&#039;s what I&#039;ve heard.)  So autopsies would be sort of like murders.]]></description>

The problem with this particular research is that people quite correctly see it as a possible prelude to deliberate interventions that will affect the whole Earth&#039;s atmosphere.  If we aren&#039;t careful this could be disastrous.

But the research could also show these interventions are likely to be dangerous, so it might also serve to &lt;em&gt;prevent&lt;/em&gt; these interventions.]]></description>

Agree completely. The jet-stream patterns are complex and who knows what would happen to regional climate if that gets thrown for a loop. The consensus can&#039;t even seem to agree what causes the equatorial stratospheric wind cycling (the QBO), so I can&#039;t imagine they can understand what happens in the upper latitudes with any certainty.

See further a long-running discussion over in the Azimuth Project Forum on the QBO and ENSO thread.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Maybe something that could be used to help sell people on the idea of doing this research would be to compare it to something similar that happened in the past.

@WHUT,

While I agree the albedo hacking seems utter folly, since it solves little of the full problem and has the potential for many unintended consequences, both physical and social, I think its champions would argue that it is no more foolish than our current unimpeded path, even after more than 50 years of scientific advice.

That doesn&#039;t justify it, though.]]></description>

I thought the whole idea was to prevent the Earth&#039;s atmosphere from degenerating into something like either Venus&#039; or Mars&#039;. Surely there&#039;s much to be learned by carefully studying exactly what we are trying to avoid? I am surprised to read that much about the solar &#039;atmosphere&#039; is also not well understood.

True, that is a lot more money, but much U.S. economic expansion came from massive spending on &quot;global cascading, avalanche climate catastrophe early-warning and avoidance&quot;. (Ever since &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; dropped the Keynesian gold standard, and the emergence of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Econophysics&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;econophysical&lt;/a&gt; Hayekian Austrian School of Economics, I really don&#039;t understand what money &#039;is&#039;, nor how to measure it correctly.)

Repairing the ozone hole was apparently a big success. Hopefully smarter people than &lt;i&gt;moi&lt;/i&gt; will continue to be in positions of respected authority and be allowed to act responsibly as needed.]]></description>
