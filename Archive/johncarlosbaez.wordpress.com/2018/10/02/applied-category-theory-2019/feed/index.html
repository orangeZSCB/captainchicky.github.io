					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2018/10/02/applied-category-theory-2019/#comment-135045&quot;&gt;John Baez&lt;/a&gt;.

Dear John, two points: 
(1) the correct reference is to the chemlambda project page https://github.com/chorasimilarity/chemlambda-gui/blob/gh-pages/dynamic/README.md  (which gives to anybody the means to reproduce the simulation), the name of the molecule or even the place where is it available https://github.com/chorasimilarity/chemlambda-gui/blob/gh-pages/dynamic/mol/tape_long_4653_2.mol and the place where the simulation used for the animation is available https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.4747390.v1 
(2) this situation shows problems of Open Science. Indeed the chemlambda project was pursued as OS on purpose. The idea is that OS satisfies greater rigorousness criteria than previously. Instead of peer review, there is the possibility of independent validation by the reader.  There are other problems which are not related to the situation at hand (like where and how can be published an article like Molecular computers http://chorasimilarity.github.io/chemlambda-gui/dynamic/molecular.html  or how to handle the situation when a lazy reviewer does not use the means of validation provided by the author and instead emits an impressionistic opinion, like &quot;not interesting for this journal&quot;, or &quot;how is this different than _other_article?&quot;). But in this situation is a clear bias against OS.

Suppose that I use lemma 1.2 from yor article J. Baez,  Article about blabla, Journal of Whatever 3(4) 2014.  I copy-paste it and I put it in my article without any attribution. You would be completely annoyed by this and you write a note about this. As a response I add to the lemma the text (lemma by John Baez) and no reference to the article. Or suppose I use a pretty picture obtained from a real biology experiment, without exact attribution. 
The comparison is not crazy,  because there is no difference between a (program, it&#039;s execution) and a (lemma, proof). In this case the initial and final molecules are the lemma and the execution according to the chemlambda so-called &quot;stupid&quot; algorithm is an (automated) proof.]]></description>

No, the correct attribution is like a reference (why should I mention this?) to the github page of the chemlambda project https://github.com/chorasimilarity/chemlambda-gui/blob/gh-pages/dynamic/README.md  and to the place where the simulation used for making the animation is available, i.e. https://figshare.com/articles/The_Chemlambda_collection_of_simulations/4747390]]></description>

Sure, I&#039;ll credit you!  I had this nice animation on my desktop for so long that I&#039;d forgotten who made it.  I apologize for not doing some research before using it.]]></description>

chorasimilarity, I see that your link points to some additional info, thanks.  (And sorry for misspelling your screen name:-).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[John (or chorasimularity), you going to give us a hint about the animation?  About the only behavioral regularity I see is that the feeders grow when they eat.

It also seems that red nodes are a) specific to the 1st feeder, b) not needed for splitting (the top feeder splits), and c) disappear (and maybe appear) over time.

(I suppose you&#039;re going to tell us that this complex behavior results from some combination of adding 3 and dividing by 2:-)]]></description>
