Sorry, still in dramatic-writing mode...

tl;dr - Ideas are not always reducible to the problems they solve, and the concepts on which ideas are based matter very much. This is not &quot;we will improve some well-established industry in the following ways&quot; or &quot;check out this programming language&quot; - it is &quot;there is a vast new space of possibility that we do not understand; here are our ideas so far; so theorists, please join us in working towards the systematization of distributed systems, otherwise we will continue to make the same old mistakes in the new era.&quot; The spiel may sound grand, but our position is humble.]]></description>

Viktor, besides the vocabulary we are developing in the ValueFlows project, you might want to look at the work that Bill McCarthy and the REA (Resource, Event, Agent) community are doing with accounting and economic standards, collaboration spaces, and blockchains. Here&#039;s a recent slide deck from a presentation to the American Accounting Association:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxlqOeaPnXHfTkpPRlFNbzcxR0k/view

That work was a big influence on ValueFlows, but is also interesting in its own right.

Viktor, thank you very much for the links. I will study them. I&#039;m way behind in category theory, though, so am trying catch up in many dimensions.

But yes, we are also working on a semantic approach to economics, and I am gaining confidence that collaborating with this group will speed the plow.

We are also working on an Economic Agent App that should be usable in many contexts that can either use the same vocabulary or use a vocabulary translator, which we are also working on. I&#039;ll be looking at your links to see if I think it would be usable in your context.]]></description>

jscheidtmann, I agree with you completely. Fortunately, we have an answer:

The Statebox language will have the following, peculiar features:
- Being heavily based on category theory it is functional in nature, something that will make easier to write correct code;
- It will use a combination of Petri nets and string diagrams to allow developers to write concurrent, decentralized software in a modular way;
- The direct link between diagrammatic languages and the underlying theories we are using gives to the developer the possibility to switch from &quot;code&quot; to &quot;visual debug&quot; in terms of boxes/wires and/or Petri nets in real time.
This is very useful since the developer will be able to use his/her geometrical intuition to check if what is being done is right;
- The use of a decentralized archive of data structures (It&#039;s vague, I know, but there will soon be more info about this) will give the developer the possibility to incorporate libraries of other programming languages into Statebox. This makes our language very useful to develop complex projects that can be core, front-end related or blockchain related, without having to wait ages for suitable libraries to come out;
- In general, Statebox is particularly useful when it comes to develop complex projects that have to be failsafe. One good example is the development of smart contracts, that needs to be absolutely reliable if one doesn&#039;t want to burn millions of dollars just pressing the wrong button.

If you are skeptical for the moment, I perfectly understand your point of view. We would be more than glad to keep in touch with you so that when we can be a bit more descriptive about &quot;what&#039;s going on&quot; you&#039;ll know!]]></description>

Hey John!

At the moment we are drafting a monograph with all the mathematical structure we are going to use spelled out. The goal of the monograph is basically to explain how the following mathematical theories:
- Open Petri Nets
- Petri Calculus
- Information-gain computing
- String diagrams
- F-Algebras and Categorical Data Structures
- Open Games
- Operads
- (maybe more)
Interact together in the statebox infrastructure. We think we have enough material now and we are working to make it readable. Hopefully the monograph - or a big chunk of it, at least - will be publicly available in a few months. We will keep everyone updated!]]></description>

Christian, thank you for your confirming reply and your interest in our project. It is one of a series of related projects. Here&#039;s a short version of the background:
https://github.com/django-rea/rea-app/wiki

We have a new potential project that is provisionally titled &quot;Accounting for Planetary Survival&quot; which I would like to have a good mathematical foundation. Thus my interested in following this gang of category theorists as they explore networks.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  what do you envision for the idea as a whole?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

We are grandiose. We want to develop a new and better economic system. Why not?

But we do it by a series of participatory action research project with live networks that also want to do that, so we can figure out what works and what doesn&#039;t.]]></description>

Hi Bob, I have looked at valueflo.ws and it seems that your project in general fits well into our semantical approach to economics. You might want to have a look at our work on categorical &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Winschel_V/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;games&lt;/a&gt;. But we also have much broader economic concepts in scope, see some of the texts at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oicos.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;oicos&lt;/a&gt;. Concretely, your valueflows concepts as RDF triples might be located in the data layer of our social stack (institutions, games, networks, accounting, data, computing) implementing social systems: see p. 21 in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1009.1166.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;categorical databases&lt;/a&gt; where RDF triples are produced by some Grothendieck construction. However, getting concepts right on the natural language layer, connect it to (categorical) formalisations of economic theory and RDF triples is an important part of our interdisciplinary work.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is an important question. I can only speak for OICOS and our games language (but I think Jelle would mostly agree): The problems where OICOS started off have been monetary models for decisions on central banking policy as they are used in central banks. My PhD work produced &lt;a href=&quot;http://jbendge.sourceforge.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;JBendge&lt;/a&gt; for machine learning of model classes used in the ECB, the FED and the like. In order to arrive at a DSL for that we needed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Winschel_V/0/1/0/all/0/1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;generalise game theory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=15042&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;economics&lt;/a&gt; and understand the needed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=14182&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;math&lt;/a&gt; first. In my original application of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/s2d9vkzzp830mvc/winschel_oca_2005.pdf?dl=0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;optimal currency areas&lt;/a&gt;, for example for the question of whether eastern European countries should join the Euro, I processed about 6000 time series (about 50 years of data), i.e. macro economic variables of about 30 countries. If one would write a full economic model for that it would amount to hierarchical layers of networks (workers, companies, production sectors, countries, regions, central banks, ...) and full of strategic games and decisions. You could program that in Fortran, Matlab or Java (as I did) or you could step back and think about a DSL for games (as I did after I realised that there is Lisp, Prolog or Haskell and the Y-combinator...). By now the project developed into a DSL for a social engine (see my answer above what a social engine is meant to be) and projects are like: energy networks (auctions, strategic players like energy producers and consumers, batteries, ...) of huge sizes (7 network layers for all of Germany or 16 subnetworks with 100.000s of households in Norway). Another project are self-organisational structures for the management of public goods like the Nobel prized work of Elinor Ostrom for example against overfishing in the north Atlantic by Dutch boats / fishing factories. This involves complex auctions, mechanism and institutional design issues. The bottom line: downloads and tutorials are to come, by now tutorials are scientific papers. Regarding the developers: we are working hard to finance them by working in industry and convincing people that we can solve problems with this general approach or at least the knowledge about categories, semantics and DSLs in the background. However, there is of course not only theory in terms of semantics via categories but also down to earth numerics, clouds, deployment issues and the like which makes all of our project into something really complicated especially since economists (most of them) do not get what we want and computer scientists are (too often) reluctant to read the non-mathematical economic literature and often start with the (broken or insufficient) mathematical approach of standard economics. The original economic issues as we understand it should be based on the modern mathematics of formal semantics in programming language design.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is an important question. I can only speak for OICOS and our games language (but I think Jelle would mostly agree): The problems where OICOS started off have been monetary models for decisions on central banking policy as they are used in central banks. My PhD work produced <a href="http://jbendge.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">JBendge</a> for machine learning of model classes used in the ECB, the FED and the like. In order to arrive at a DSL for that we needed to <a href="https://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Winschel_V/0/1/0/all/0/1" rel="nofollow">generalise game theory</a> and <a href="http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=15042" rel="nofollow">economics</a> and understand the needed <a href="http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=14182" rel="nofollow">math</a> first. In my original application of <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/s2d9vkzzp830mvc/winschel_oca_2005.pdf?dl=0" rel="nofollow">optimal currency areas</a>, for example for the question of whether eastern European countries should join the Euro, I processed about 6000 time series (about 50 years of data), i.e. macro economic variables of about 30 countries. If one would write a full economic model for that it would amount to hierarchical layers of networks (workers, companies, production sectors, countries, regions, central banks, &#8230;) and full of strategic games and decisions. You could program that in Fortran, Matlab or Java (as I did) or you could step back and think about a DSL for games (as I did after I realised that there is Lisp, Prolog or Haskell and the Y-combinator&#8230;). By now the project developed into a DSL for a social engine (see my answer above what a social engine is meant to be) and projects are like: energy networks (auctions, strategic players like energy producers and consumers, batteries, &#8230;) of huge sizes (7 network layers for all of Germany or 16 subnetworks with 100.000s of households in Norway).
