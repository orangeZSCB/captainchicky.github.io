Yes, that&#039;s my trick. Sorry for not writing it up sooner!

I always found the volume of a regular tetrahedron a bit annoying, so I&#039;m happy that putting it in one extra dimension makes it easier to understand.  I&#039;m especially happy that it&#039;s connected to the nice description of the $latex \mathrm{A}_n$ lattice:

$latex \{ (x_1, \dots, x_{n+1}): \; x_i \in \mathbb{Z}, x_1 + \cdots x_{n+1} = 0 \}$]]></description>

I think I’ve guessed your trick for computing the volume of that $latex p$-simplex.  You know that the volume of the $latex (p+1)$-simplex with the same vertices plus the origin in $latex \mathbb{R}^{p+1}$ is $latex \frac{1}{(p+1)!}$, and its “height” is easily seen to be $latex \frac{1}{\sqrt{p+1}}$.  So:

$latex \displaystyle{\frac{1}{p+1} S(p) \frac{1}{\sqrt{p+1}} =  
\frac{1}{(p+1)!}}$
$latex \displaystyle{S(p) =  \frac{\sqrt{p+1}}{p!}}$

I still like the Gram matrix version, too! I get more confused trying to juggle ratios with factorials and square roots in my head than I do picturing a $latex p \times p$ matrix with integer entries:  first all 1s except 2 on the diagonal, then all $latex p+1$ along the first row, and then the same as the identity matrix for other rows ... so the determinant is just $latex p+1$.]]></description>

I know how to get the &lt;em&gt;squared&lt;/em&gt; volume from the determinant of a Gramian matrix that is 2 on the diagonal and 1 elsewhere, but you must have a better trick!]]></description>

Great!   Yes, I meant the second moment.  I must be going senile, because at the time I was sure that &#039;variance&#039; was a shorthand for &#039;second moment&#039; just like &#039;mean&#039; is short for &#039;first moment&#039;.

It&#039;s cool that the squared volume of a regular $latex p$-simplex with sides of length $latex \sqrt{2}$ looks simpler than the volume of a regular $latex p$-simplex with sides of length 1... mainly because of the $latex \sqrt{2}.$   I guess it means that the nicest regular $latex p-$simplex is the one in $latex \mathbb{R}^{p+1}$ whose corners are

$latex (1,0,0,\dots), (0,1,0,\dots), (0,0,1,\dots), \dots $]]></description>

I think you mean the second moment, not the variance!  The variance approaches zero.  But the second moment certainly does approach the squared volume of the regular $latex p$-simplex whose edges have length $latex \sqrt{2}$, which is:

$latex \displaystyle{\frac{p+1}{(p!)^2}}$]]></description>

This is great!  I&#039;m amazed that such a simple formula exists.  Not that it&#039;s so simple---but it&#039;s still simpler than I would have guessed!

Over on Twitter I conjectured a formula for the mean volume of a $latex p$-simplex in the unit sphere in $latex \mathbb{R}^d,$ in the limit $latex d \to \infty.$    I&#039;m guessing it should equal the volume of a regular $latex p$-simplex whose sides have length $latex \sqrt{2}$.

But I would be perfectly content to know that the &lt;em&gt;variance&lt;/em&gt; of the volume of a $latex p$-simplex in the unit sphere in $latex \mathbb{R}^d$ approaches the &lt;em&gt;square&lt;/em&gt; of the volume of a regular $latex p$-simplex whose sides have length $latex \sqrt{2}$.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I’m not sure if I’ll ever have the energy to rigorously prove the following formula, but based on some proofs of particular subsets and a lot of empirical evidence for the rest, I’m 99% sure that the $latex 2m$&lt;i&gt;th&lt;/i&gt; moment of the volume of a $latex p$-simplex whose vertices are chosen at random from a unit sphere in $latex \mathbb{R}^d, p\le d$ is given by:

$latex \displaystyle{(p!)^{-2 m} \prod _{q=1}^m \frac{(d+2 q-3)! ((p+1) (d-2)+2 p m+2 q)}{(d+2 q-p-2)! (d+2 q-2)^p}}$

If that’s a bit much to digest, the first even moment, the mean of the squared volume of the  $latex p$-simplex, is:

$latex \displaystyle{\frac{(p+1) d!}{d^{p}(p!)^2 (d-p)!}}$

For any given $latex p$ the formula can be expressed in terms of gamma functions, and the odd moments, such as the mean volume, can then be found by setting $latex m$ to half-integer values.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I opened a Twitter account back in March 2016 but had not been active at all without even a single tweeting until this May 2018 simply because I thought it would be just wasting my time. I was so wrong about that and I wish I started using Twitter much earlier. Here is what I found. Twitter can be a great social media platform for intellectual activities including getting and sharing information,  discussing ideas and opinions on math and getting connected with people in the disciplines of your interests in math. I also recently witnessed an amazing collaborative math work being done on Twitter and that makes me think that Twitter can be also an effective research tool for mathematicians to collaborate with other mathematicians. I was also pleasantly surprised that there are quite a few mathematicians who are tweeting actively and daily tweets from some of them are quite intellectually stimulating. I particularly love inspirational and informative tweets from John Baez and Sam Walters. Reading their tweets and participating in the discussions whenever I can became a great joy of my daily life.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2018/07/10/random-points-on-a-sphere-part-1/&quot;&gt;Random Points on a Sphere (Part 1)&lt;/a&gt;, we learned an interesting fact.   You can take the unit sphere in $latex \mathbb{R}^n$, randomly choose two points on it, and compute their distance.  This gives a random variable, whose moments you can calculate.

And then for the interesting part: when n = 1, 2 or 4, and seemingly in no other cases, all the even moments are &lt;em&gt;integers&lt;/em&gt;.

The reason is that these are the dimensions in which the spheres are &lt;em&gt;groups&lt;/em&gt;.  We can see that the even moments are integers because they are differences of dimensions of certain representations of these groups.   So, Rogier Brussee and Allen Knutson pointed out that if we want to broaden our line of investigation, we can look at other compact Lie groups.  That&#039;s what I&#039;ll do today.]]></description>
