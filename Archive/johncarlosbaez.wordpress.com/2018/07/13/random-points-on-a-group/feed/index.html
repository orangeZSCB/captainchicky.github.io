For any Riemannnian metric $latex g$ on a surface, near any point we can multiply it by a smooth positive function $latex f$ so that the metric $latex f g$ is flat.  I think that&#039;s what Leo was trying to say.  Anyway, it&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformally_flat_manifold&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;true&lt;/a&gt;.  (It&#039;s just a local statement, not a global one, since the Gauss-Bonnet theorem says any metric on a sphere has curvature whose integral over the whole sphere is nonzero.)

However, one of the several metrics we&#039;re talking about is - I believe - not a Riemannian metric.   Namely, the &#039;straight line distance&#039; between two points in SU(3) defined using a straight line in the ambient Euclidean space of 3&#215;3 matrices.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Leo, when you write “we can perform a conformal transformation to put this in a standard form of the metric on Euclidean 2-space”, by “this” do you mean the matrix-based metric where the distance squared between diagonal matrices (with phases $latex \alpha, \beta$ for two of their entries) is:

$latex 
\displaystyle{d^2 = 6-2 \cos \left(\alpha _1-\alpha _2+\beta _1-\beta _2\right)-2 \cos \left(\alpha _1-\alpha _2\right)-2 \cos \left(\beta _1-\beta _2\right)}$

I think since we&#039;re looking at a 2 dimensional space, since all 2-metrics are conformally flat, we can perform a conformal transformation to put this in a standard form of the metric on Euclidean 2-space. So, the angles at the corners will be the same, but somehow the shapes of the triangles will get deformed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is what it looks like if you take the diagonal subgroup of SU(3), a 2-torus, embed (multiple copies) in the plane using the flat metric that comes from its Killing form, and then take the quotient under the $latex S_3$ where you permute the diagonal entries, giving the equilateral triangles here that are SU(3)/conjugation.

The colours here encode the trace.

Yes, or more generally: there&#039;s the metric you wrote down, and there&#039;s the deltoid which is a subset of the flat plane, and one could ask if there&#039;s &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; distance-preserving bijection between them (allowing rescaling to increase one&#039;s chance of success).

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Any compact simple Lie group has a Riemannian metric, unique up to a scale factor, that&#039;s invariant under both left and right translations.  In general you can get ahold of it using the &quot;Killing form&quot;, which is the unique-up-to-scale invariant metric on the Lie algebra: you can use

$latex g(v,w) = -\textrm{tr}( \rho(v) \rho(w) ) $

where $latex \rho$ is any nontrivial representation of the Lie algebra.  But thanks to uniqueness it&#039;s also the induced metric you get from the usual embedding of SU(3) in 3&#215;3 matrices.]]></description>

Distances measured that way wouldn’t agree with distances in the space of 3×3 complex matrices as defined in your post.

Thanks!

I&#039;m feeling a bit confused... that metric doesn&#039;t give the triangle the geometry of a deltoid, does it?  I see no reason it &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt;.  In fact I don&#039;t even see why it should be a Riemannian metric!   And that makes me realize I don&#039;t understand non-Riemannian metrics on a manifold, or even a solid triangle.

If we take the usual Riemannian metric on SU(3) and use that to get a metric on SU(3)/conjugation, does &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; give this space the geometry of a deltoid?   I don&#039;t think it should: the deltoid has sharp cuspy corners, while I think the metric I&#039;m talking about should give corners with 60&#176; angles, because right near a corner we might as well be working with Cartan algebra mod the Weyl group, i.e. the plane mod the symmetry group of an equilateral triangle.]]></description>

If we parameterise diagonal matrices by two of their phases, $latex \alpha, \beta$, then the squared distance between two such matrices is:

$latex \displaystyle{6-2 \cos \left(\alpha _1-\alpha _2+\beta _1-\beta _2\right)-2 \cos \left(\alpha _1-\alpha _2\right)-2 \cos \left(\beta _1-\beta _2\right)}$]]></description>

Neat!  I had a mental image of compact Lie groups as all being &#039;round&#039;, which made me wrongly feel that each point had a unique maximally distant point.

So we could look at the matrix distance between points in SU(3)/conjugation, and it would give a different metric on the triangle.  What&#039;s that other metric like?]]></description>
