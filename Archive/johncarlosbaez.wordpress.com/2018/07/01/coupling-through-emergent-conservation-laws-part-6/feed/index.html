					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2018/07/01/coupling-through-emergent-conservation-laws-part-6/#comment-123581&quot;&gt;Scott Oswald&lt;/a&gt;.

If you have $latex n$ species, the space $latex \mathbb{R}^n$ can be thought of as the space of possible concentrations of all species, but also any complex can be thought of as a vector in this space, and thus any &lt;em&gt;change&lt;/em&gt; of complexes caused by a reaction can be thought of as a vector in this space, called the &#039;reaction vector&#039;.   Given a specific reaction network, the collection of all reaction vectors span a subspace of $latex \mathbb{R}^n$ called the &#039;stoichiometric subspace&#039;.  This describes the possible changes in concentration that could be caused by reactions in the reaction network.

On the other hand, any vector $latex u \in \mathbb{R}^n$ also determines a &#039;quantity&#039; (possibly conserved, possibly not) that assigns a number to any given choice of concentrations.   It does so using the dot product: if $latex c \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is a choice of concentrations, we get a number $latex u \cdot c.$

Thus, if $latex v$ is a vector in the stoichiometric subspace, which describes a possible &lt;em&gt;change&lt;/em&gt; in concentrations, $latex u \cdot v$ will be the corresponding change in the quantity corresponding to $latex u.$

If $latex u$ is orthogonal to the whole stoichiometric subspace, this change will always be zero, so the quantity is &lt;em&gt;conserved&lt;/em&gt;.

Thus, the orthogonal complement of the stoichiometric subspace is the space of conservation laws.

It follows that the dimension of the stoichiometric subspace plus the dimension of the space of conserved quantities equals $latex n.$

In other words, the maximum number of linearly independent reaction vectors plus the maximum number of linearly independent conservation laws is $latex n$.

In the example at hand this equation amounts to 3 + 4 = 7.

This stuff is part of reaction network theory.   I think this is a pretty good, though long, introduction:

Given a specific reaction network, the collection of all reaction vectors span a subspace of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5En&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;mathbb{R}^n" class="latex" /> called the &#8216;stoichiometric subspace&#8217;.

<p>If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="u" class="latex" /> is orthogonal to the whole stoichiometric subspace, this change will always be zero, so the quantity is <em>conserved</em>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;
  Any change in concentrations caused by these reactions must lie in the stoichiometric subspace: that is, the space spanned by the reaction vectors. Since these vectors obey one nontrivial relation:
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&#091;v_\alpha + v_\beta = v_\gamma + v_\delta&#093;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  the stochiometric subspace is 3-dimensional. Therefore, the space of conserved quantities must be 4-dimensional,
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I see why the stochiometric subspace must be 3-dimensional, but I am not sure why the conserved quantities must be 4-dimensional. What determines the number of conserved quantities given a set of reaction vectors?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[there must be 12 linearly independent conserved quantities.  Some of these conservation laws are &#039;fundamental&#039;, at least by the standards of chemistry.  All the species involved are made of 6 different atoms (carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur), and conservation of charge provides another fundamental conserved quantity, for a total of 7.

(In our example from last time we didn&#039;t keep track of conservation of hydrogen and charge, because both $latex \mathrm{H}^+$ and $latex e^-$ ions are freely available in water... but we studied the citric acid cycle when we were younger, more energetic and less wise, so we kept careful track of hydrogen and charge, and made sure that all the reactions conserved these.  So, we&#039;ll have 7 fundamental conserved quantities.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Last time we examined ATP hydrolysis as a simple example of coupling through emergent conservation laws, but the phenomenon is more general. A slightly more complicated example is the urea cycle. The first metabolic cycle to be discovered, it is used by land-dwelling vertebrates to convert ammonia, which is highly toxic, to urea for excretion. Now we&#8217;ll find 11 conserved quantities in the urea cycle, including 7 emergent ones. [&#8230;]]]></description>
