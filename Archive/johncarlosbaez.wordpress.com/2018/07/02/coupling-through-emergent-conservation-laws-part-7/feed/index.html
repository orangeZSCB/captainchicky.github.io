&lt;blockquote&gt;
  I think most if not all cycles in biochemistry are reversible.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

They&#039;re all reversible in principle; each given reaction will start running in reverse if the concentrations of its products become high enough that the reverse reaction becomes becomes thermodynamically favored.

But you probably know that; the more interesting question is which cycles actually &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; run in reverse under some biologically reasonable conditions!

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  . One point Larry Moran makes is that cells are nearly at equilibrium, so the reverse reactions don’t require huge changes (to inflows and outflows for example)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I&#039;d really like to know how close they are to equilibrium.  Our analysis here is based on a &#039;quasiequilibrium&#039; assumption, meaning that all the enzyme-catalyzed reactions are in equilibrium... but not the rest.  I&#039;d like to know how far from being right this is.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  There’s a recent blog post http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2018/05/fixing-carbon-by-reversing-citric-acid.html about the reversed citric acid cycle.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Very nice!  And the author has another post that explains why we had trouble getting the citric acid cycle to balance down to the last proton:

&#8226; Laurence Moran, &lt;a href=&quot;http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2008/11/biochemistry-on-web-citric-acid-cycle.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Biochemistry on the web: the citric acid cycle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Sandwalk&lt;/em&gt;, 28 November 2008.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  This is the time of the year when I challenge the students in my introductory biochemistry class to find one single website that correctly shows the reactions of the citric acid cycle with all the correct substrates and products (including water and protons). There are two sites that don&#039;t count: ones with images from my book (Horton et al.) and ones that are direct copies of the International Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB) website. In five years my students have not succeeded.

					<description><![CDATA[An interesting series of posts!

I think most if not all cycles in biochemistry are reversible. I would like to see what you need to do in order to make the urea cycle go in reverse.

There&#039;s a recent blog post http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2018/05/fixing-carbon-by-reversing-citric-acid.html about the reversed citric acid cycle. One point Larry Moran makes is that cells are nearly at equilibrium, so the reverse reactions don&#039;t require huge changes (to inflows and outflows for example).

Finally I&#039;m reminded of this, on how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions when fertilizing soil. &quot;the use of urea fertiliser with nitrification inhibitors—this product inhibits the conversion of ammonium-N to nitrate-N by specialised soil bacteria. It is only when nitrogen is in the nitrate form that N2O can be formed.&quot; from https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/land/soil/soil-health/greenhouse-gases. I wonder what those bacteria are doing.]]></description>
