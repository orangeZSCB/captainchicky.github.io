I haven&#039;t thought about this!   It&#039;s an interesting question.   There is a category of reaction networks, or more precisely &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/03/31/network-theory-part-2/&quot;&gt;stochastic Petri nets&lt;/a&gt;, where a map is a function sending species to species and reactions to reactions, preserving rate constants.   There should be a similar category of detailed balanced reaction networks, and a functor from this to a category of affine toric varieties.  Working out the details should tell us what kind of morphisms of toric varieties we want!

First I should finish my paper with Jade Master, which among other things discusses the category of Petri nets.]]></description>

Which basic operations do you want on the reaction networks. Adding a reaction, but keeping the possible reactants the same and adding a reactant that doesn&#039;t contribute to any reactions are the ones that come to mind. But would you want anything different? To determine the types of morphisms for the resulting varieties.]]></description>

Yes!   If the rate constants are all 1, this gives equilibria with

$latex [\mathrm{A}] = [\mathrm{B}]^2 = [\mathrm{C}]^3$

The twisted cubic!

Now some algebraic geometer should tell me what&#039;s cool about the twisted cubic... some facts that might inspire new thoughts on chemistry.]]></description>

I want to do something cool like this.  But aren&#039;t &lt;em&gt;affine&lt;/em&gt; toric varieties too boring to have interesting cohomological invariants?  I don&#039;t know, this is just a guess based on the fact that over $latex \mathbb{R}$ the examples I&#039;ve seen all look contractible... and the fact that people who talk about toric varieties instantly move to more general ones.

I don&#039;t agree that one only gets a few points.  The dimension of your toric variety will be (at least) the number of conserved quantities, since there will be (at least, but it turns out exactly) as many detailed balanced equilibria as there are choices for the values of all those conserved quantities.

So, for example, in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2018/07/02/coupling-through-emergent-conservation-laws-part-7/&quot;&gt;urea cycle&lt;/a&gt; discussed earlier, the space of detailed balanced equilibria will be an 11-dimensional toric variety.   As far as chemistry goes this variety is defined over the rig of nonnegative reals, but we can work over the complex numbers if we&#039;re looking for interesting invariants to attach to this variety.

But because of everything I&#039;ve said, I have a fear that this toric varieity, like the space of possible choices of conserved quantities, will be contractible!

That doesn&#039;t rule out the possibility of interesting invariants, but it means they&#039;ll be more like algebraic geomety than topology.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If you regarding the concentrations as complex variables, I wonder what would the class in $latex K_0 (Var_\mathbb{C})$ look like with all its cohomological information contained within. Then take norm on both sides of all the equations. My guess would be that the result is often just a disjoint union of very few points since it seems like it&#039;s very hard to be in detailed balance with so many reactions in the network.

I am glad you liked it.  There were 
some new ideas for me in that link.  If
i understand correctly the reaction 
vectors for the reaction:

$latex X + Y \rightleftharpoons XY$

are $latex (1,1,-1)$ and $latex (-1,-1,1)$ which
span a 1 dimensional subspace which is the 
stoichiometric subspace for this 
reaction.  What i called the invariant 
lines are parallel to the stoichiometric
subspace.

I think you may be right that there 
is a slick way to relate the two systems
with conservation laws.  Since the plane 
$latex N=0$ is invariant under the 
dynamical system we can restrict the 
dynamical system to this plane.  In this 
plane $latex [X] = [Y]$.  Even though 
$latex X$ and $latex Y$ are two distinct 
species within this plane their 
concentrations could vary the same as 
for the two atoms and diatomic molecule
reaction, assuming they have the same 
values for their rate constants.]]></description>

Hi!  I worked through your analysis.   It&#039;s nice.  In the end this system behaves quite similarly to the reaction network

$latex 
  \mathrm{B} \mathrel{\substack{\alpha \\\longleftrightarrow\\ \beta}}   \mathrm{A} + \mathrm{A}
$

which I discussed here:

&#8226; &lt;a href=&quot;https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/11/21/network-theory-part-18/&quot;&gt;Network theory (part 18)&lt;/a&gt;.

Here there are only 2 species, not 3, and only 1 conservation law, not 2, but when you take advantage of the conservation law you&#039;re led to the logistic equation again.  There should be some slick way to say that when you take advantage of the conservation laws these systems become isomorphic.]]></description>

I choose the letter &#039;M&#039; for &quot;mass&quot;.  I was thinking of Lavoisier&#039;s law on the conservation of mass.  The letter &#039;N&#039; is just the next letter in the alphabet.
