<b>Introduction</b></p><p>



</p><p>



The effectiveness of the present-day submarine depends upon its

ability to remain undetected for long periods of time while it

searches, tracks, or attacks from beneath the sea surface.  This

medium of concealment, however, is advantageous to the submarine

only so long as it is not detected or deprived of its ability to

detect.  Before a submarine can be attacked, it must be detected

and its subsequent positions determined within the requirements of

the available weapons system.  Detection and position fixing can

take place in two ways.  There may either be some radiation or

reflection of energy from the submarine to the searcher, or else

the submarine may disturb one of the natural, static, spatial

fields, such as the earth's magnetic field, thereby betraying its

presence.</p><p>



</p><p>



	The choice of energy to be used for underwater detection is

determined by three factors:</p><p>



</p><p>



	1.  Range of penetration in the medium.</p><p>



	2.  Ability to differentiate between various objects in the

medium.</p><p>



	3.  Speed of propagation.</p><p>



</p><p>



	Of all the known physical phenomena, light has excellent

differentiation ability and high speed of transmission, but its

range in water is very limited, on the order of tens of meters,

thereby restricting its operational usefulness.  This is not to say

that light will never be used in ASW, for continuing

experimentation and perfection of laser light detectors might yet

add this method to the arsenal.  Radio frequency waves also are

propagated with extreme rapidity and to great distances through

certain mediums, but sea water is essentially impervious to them

for most frequencies.  VLF signals will penetrate only about 10

meters, whereas higher frequency penetration depths can be measured

in millimeters.  Magnetic and gravitational field distortions are

detectable only at very short ranges because the anomaly diminishes

proportionally with the inverse of the range cubed.  While their

detection range is greater than either light or radio frequency, it

is only of the magnitude of several hundred meters and therefore is

insufficient for normal surveillance.</p><p>



</p><p>



	Acoustic energy, while lacking the propagation speed of

electromagnetic waves, is capable of being transmitted through the

sea to distances that are operationally significant.  Because of

this, sound is the physical phenomenon used for antisubmarine

warfare, underwater communications, and underwater navigation.  It

must not be inferred, however, that sound is a panacea.  It too has

significant limitations to its effective employment, all of which

must be thoroughly understood by the operators of underwater sound

equipment.  The optimum use of sound requires a thorough

understanding of its limitations so that these effects can be

minimized.  For example, sea water is not uniform in pressure,

temperature, or salinity, and all these characteristics have important effects on sound propagation through the sea.  The

requirement for predicting these effects on sonar performance has

become a necessity, and a difficult one at that.</p><p>



</p><p>



8.2  <b>FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS</b></p><p><b>



</b></p><p>



All sound, whether produced by a cowbell or a complicated

electronic device, behaves in much the same manner.  Sound

originates as a wave motion by a vibrating source and requires for

its transmission an elastic medium such as air or water.  For

example, consider a piston suspended in one of these mediums.  As

the piston is forced to move forward and backward, the medium is

compressed on the forward stroke and decompressed or rarefied on

the return stroke.  Thus, a wave motion or series of compressions

and rarefactions is caused to move from the source out through the

medium.  In the fluid medium the molecular motion is back and

forth, parallel to the direction of the piston's movement.  Because

the fluid is compressible, this motion results in a series of

detectable pressure changes.  This series of compressions and

rarefactions, such as is produced by the piston, constitutes a

compressional wave train.  Another way of explaining the phenomenon

of acoustic wave propagation is to consider the medium of

transmission as a loosely packed collection of mass elements

connected by springy bumpers.  A disturbance of the elements at

some point (e.g., piston motion) moves along in the fluid by the

successive extension and compression of the springs as the elements

swing back and forth, each communicating its motion to its neighbor

through the connecting bumpers.  In this way, the agitation of a

cluster of elements is propagated through the medium even though

the individual elements do no more than move about their

equilibrium positions without actually migrating.  The sound wave

propagates parallel to the source resulting in a longitudinal wave. 

Recall from radar principles that the electromagnetic wave

propagated perpendicular to the source, resulting in a transverse

wave.</p><p>

<p>



</p><p>



8.2.1  <b>The Sound Wave</b></p><p>



The sine wave of figure 8-1 is graphical representation of the

compressional wave train.  As the wave passes a given point, the

fluid elements are compressed and extended in the manner depicted

by the sine wave's oscillations above and below the static

pressure.  The compressions and rarefactions are so labeled on the

curve.  There are two important things to note on this curve.  The

first is the maximum amplitude of the sine wave, labeled <b>P</b>, which

represents the maximum pressure excursion above and below the

static or hydrostatic pressure that exists in the fluid at the

location of the wave train.  The second thing to note is that the

wave train would be passing, or propagating at the speed of sound

<b>c</b> in the medium.  The units for speed of sound are meters per

second.  The relationship between the three acoustic quantities

that can be derived from figure 8-1 is:</p><p>



</p><p>



<u></u>            Frequency (f) = <u>Speed of sound (c)</u>          (8-1)</p><p>



                             Wavelength ()</p><p>



</p><p>



	This is exactly the same as described for electromagnetic

energy in chapter 1 and thus will not be elaborated upon.</p><p>



</p><p>



	One final point should be made about the sine wave

representation of figure 8-1.  Though somewhat difficult to imagine

and more difficult to describe pictorially, the displaced parallel

lines in figure 8-1a represent the motion of the elements within

the field as the wave train passes.  As the elements are compressed

and extended, their motion can also be mathematically described by

a sine wave; however, the elements would be oscillating to and fro

about their static position.  The maximum amplitude would then be

the maximum displacement from the static position.  To provide an

example of the order of magnitude of these displacements, consider

that the faintest 1,000 Hz tone that can just be heard in air has

pressure variations of only 2/10,000,000,000 of one atmosphere of

pressure.  The corresponding particle displacement is about 10-9	cm.  By the way of comparison, the diameter of an atom is about </p><p>



10-8 cm.</p><p>



</p><p>



	As this pressure disturbance propagates through the medium,

the pressure at any point in the medium can be expressed as a

function of the distance, r, from the source and time, t, since a

particular wave departed the source.</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



              P(r,t) = P(r)sin | <u>2</u> (r - ct) |          (8-2)</p><p>



                               |            |</p><p>



</p><p>



Note how the maximum amplitude, P(r), is dependent on the distance

from the source.  Neglecting wave interference effects, the

amplitude of a pressure disturbance will always diminish, and

equation 8-2 therefore represents a decreasing amplitude sinusoid

wave.  If, however, the distance is fixed, then pressure is solely

a function of time, and equation 8-2 simplifies to</p><p>



</p><p>



               P(t) = PAsin [2(ft)]                    (8-3)</p><p>



</p><p>



where PA is now the maximum amplitude at the range r.</p><p>



</p><p>



8.2.2  <b>Intensity</b></p><p>



</p><p>



A propagating sound wave carries mechanical energy with it in the

form of kinetic energy of the particles in motion plus the

potential energy of the stresses set up in the elastic medium. 

Because the wave is propagating, a certain amount of energy per

second, or power, is crossing a unit area and this power per unit

area, or power density is called the intensity, I, of the wave. 

The intensity is proportional to the square of the acoustic

pressure.  Before giving the defining relationship for intensity,

however, two variables must be explained.  The value of peak

pressure, P, as shown in figure 8-1 is not the "effective" or root-mean-square pressure.  An analogy exists between acoustic pressure

and the voltages measured in AC circuits.  Most voltmeters read the

rms voltage.  The rms value of a sinusoidal voltage is simply the

peak voltage divided by the square root of two.  For example, the

common 115-volt line voltage has a peak value of about 162 volts. 

In order to obtain the rms pressure, P must likewise be divided by

the square root of two.</p><p>



</p><p>



                    Pe = Prms = <u> P </u>                     (8-4)</p><p>



                                /2</p><p>



</p><p>



In this text, the effective or rms pressure as measured by a

pressure-sensitive hydrophone will be labeled Pe.  The explanation

of units for pressure will be fully discussed at a later time.</p><p>



</p><p>



8.2.3  <b>Characteristic Impedance</b></p><p>



</p><p>



The second variable that must be explained is the proportionality

factor that equates intensity to effective pressure squared.  It

consists of two terms multiplied together - fluid density,  and

the propagation speed of the wave, c.  The quantity, c, is called

the characteristic impedance; it is that property of a sound medium

that is analogous to resistance or impedance in electrical circuit

theory, where power equals voltage squared divided by resistance. 

Additionally, it can be illustrated by a simple example:  When two

dissimilar mediums, such as air and water, are adjacent to each

other, the boundary between the two is called a discontinuity. 

When sound energy is traveling through one medium and encounters a

discontinuity, part of the energy will be transferred across the

boundary and part will be reflected back into the original medium. 

The greater  the difference between the characteristic impedances,

the greater will be the percentage of energy reflected.  (The

difference between the c values for air and water in SI units is

approximately 1.5 x 106.)  Thus, when sound is traveling through

water and it reaches the surface, only a small amount is

transmitted into the air.  Most of the energy is reflected by the

air/ocean boundary back into the water.  Obviously, it is important

to maintain a consistent set of units when comparing characteristic impedances, and care must be exercised when dealing with different

sources of acoustic information.</p><p>



	With the concepts of rms pressure and characteristic impedance

understood, it is now possible to formulate an expression for

acoustic intensity, the average power per unit area normal to the

direction of wave propagation.</p><p>



</p><p>



         I = <u>pe2</u>     (pc<u>sea water</u> 1.5 x 105 dyne-sec/cm3)   (8-5)</p><p>



             pc</p><p>



</p><p>



	The units of acoustic intensity are normally watts/m2.  The

importance of equation 8-5 is that it clearly shows the dependence

of the power transmitting capacity of a train of acoustic waves on

the pressure.  If the rms pressure in the water can be measured,

then the sound intensity can be determined.  One way to do this is

by means of a hydrophone, an electrical-acoustic device, much like

a microphone, that transforms variations in water pressure into a

variable electric voltage.  Thus, after appropriate calibration, Pe

can be read directly from a voltmeter attached to the output of a

hydrophone.</p><p>



</p><p>



8.3  <b>MEASUREMENT OF ACOUSTIC PARAMETERS</b></p><p>



</p><p>



8.3.1  A convenient system is needed in order to measure and

discuss acoustic parameters.  Pressure is defined as a force per

unit area.  Although many people are familiar with the British

units of pounds per square inch (psi), it has long been the

convention in acoustics to use metric units, namely newtons per

square meter (N/m2), or dynes per square centimeter (dynes/cm2). 

Of the two metric units, the dynes/cm2 has been the most commonly

used.  It has an alternate name, microbar (bar), and is equivalent

to approximately 1/1,000,000 of a standard atmosphere.  For

underwater sounds, a reference pressure of 1 bar was established

from which all others were measured.  The corresponding reference

pressure for airborne sounds was 0.0002 bar, because this was the

approximate intensity of a 1,000-Hz tone that was barely audible to

human ears.  The previously less commonly used N/m2 also has an

alternate name, a Pascal (Pa), and the reference standard derived

from this was the micropascal (Pa), which is equivalent to 10-6N/m2.</p><p>



</p><p>



	With such a profusion of reference standards and measurement

systems, there were ample opportunities for misunderstandings as an

operator or planner consulted different sources of acoustic

information.  In 1971 the Naval Sea Systems Command directed that

thereafter all sound pressure levels should be expressed in the

Systeme Internationale (SI) units of micropascals.  Although all

new publications contain the updated standards, older references

will not until they are revised.  To assist in making conversions

until all publications are revised, table (8-1) summarizes some

conversion values.</p><p>



</p><p>



     Throughout this text, the acoustic pressure reference

standard, Po, is 1 Pa unless otherwise noted.</p><p>

              = 10-5 dyne/cm2 = 10-11 atmospheres</p><p>



<u>                                                                  </u></p><p>



</p><p>



8.3.2  <b>Sound Pressure Level</b><b> </b></p><p>



</p><p>



In theoretical investigations of acoustic phenomena, it is often

convenient to express sound pressures in newtons/m2 and sound

intensities in watts/m2.  However, in practical engineering work it

is customary to describe these same quantities through the use of

logarithmic scales known as sound pressure levels.  The reason is

related, in part, to the subjective response of the ear.  The human

ear can hear sounds having pressure disturbances as great as </p><p>



100,000,000 micropascals and as small as 10 micropascals.  A

problem is encountered when discussing pressures that vary over so

great a range, in that the minimum audible disturbance is one ten-millionth that of the maximum.  In underwater acoustics, useful

pressures having even greater variations in magnitude are commonly

encountered.  In order to make the numbers more manageable, both in

magnitude and for actual manipulation, logarithms are used rather

than the numbers themselves.  Suppose two acoustic signals are to

be compared, one having a Pe, of 100,000,000 Pa and the other a Pe

of 10 Pa.  Their ratio would be</p><p>



</p><p>



          <u>P1</u> = <u>100,000,000 Pa</u> = 10,000,000 = 107</p><p>



          P2       10 Pa</p><p>



</p><p>



	In underwater acoustics, however, the attribute of primary

interest is sound intensity, or power, rather than pressure.  As

with pressure, acoustic intensities are referenced to some standard

intensity, designated Io, and the logarithm of the ratio taken. 

Intensity level is therefore defined as</p><p>



</p><p>



               IL = 10 log(I/Io)                         (8-6)</p><p>



</p><p>



where IL is measured in dB.  However, as there is only one

intensity reference (10-12 watt/m2 in air) and many pressure

references, IL must be able to be expressed in terms of pressure. 

By inserting equation (8-5) into equation (8-6), a new expression

of IL can be obtained, which is based on pressure rather than

intensity per sec.</p><p>



</p><p>



			            <u>Pe2</u></p><p>



			IL = 10 log <u> pc</u>                            (8-7)</p><p>



                           <u>Po2</u></p><p>



                           pc</p><p>



or</p><p>



			IL = 10 log <u>Pe2</u> = 20 log <u>Pe</u></p><p>



                           Po2          Po</p><p>



<u></u><u></u><u></u></p><p>



Under the assumption that the reference intensity and the reference 

pressure are measured in the same acoustic wave, then a new sound

level can be defined called sound pressure level.</p><p>



</p><p>


               SPL = 20log  <u>Pe</u>                          (8-8)</p><p>



                            Po</p><p>



</p><p>



Since the voltage outputs of the microphones and hydrophones

commonly used in acoustic measurements are proportional to

pressure, acoustic pressure is the most readily measured variable

in a sound field.  For this reason, sound pressure level is more

widely used in specifying sound levels, and this is also why only

pressure references are used in underwater acoustics.  Note that IL

and SPL are numerically equivalent.</p><p>

                              pc</p><p>



</p><p>



8.3.3  <b>Decibels</b></p><p>



</p><p>



SPL has the dimensionless units of <u>decibels</u> (dB).  The decibel

system was selected by acousticians for a number of logical

reasons.  First, it is a logarithmic system, which is convenient

for dealing with large changes in quantities.  It also simplifies

computations since multiplication and division are reduced to

addition or subtraction, respectively.  Second, human senses have

an approximate logarithmic response to stimuli such as light,

sound, and heat.  For example, the human ear perceives about the

same change in loudness between 1 and 10 units of pressure as it

perceives between 10 and 100 units of pressure.  And finally, in

the area of underwater acoustics, the primary interest is in ratios

of power levels and signal levels rather than absolute numerical

values.  In the decibel system, the bel is the fundamental division

of a logarithmic scale for expressing the ratio of two amounts of

power.  The number of bels to express such a ratio is the logarithm

to the base 10 of the ratio.  Acousticians decided the bel was a

unit too large for application in their field, and subsequently

adopted the decibel (1/10 bel) as their basic logarithmic unit.   

The conversion factors in table 8-1 can in themselves be cumbersome

to use, but when expressed in dB, only addition or subtraction is

required.  When converting from a pressure referenced to 1 bar to

one referenced to 1 Pa, simply add 100dB.  When converting from

0.0002 bar to 1 Pa, simply add 26dB.  If converting from 1 Pa to

the others, merely subtract the appropriate values.  Table 8-2

shows some representative values of conversions between different

reference levels.  Note that the new micropascal reference standard

is small enough that negative values of decibels are rarely

encountered.</p><p>



</p><p>



	As an aid in interpreting and understanding the decibel scale

and its relation to intensity and pressure, it is useful to

remember that</p><p>



</p><p>



	a factor 2 in intensity is + 3 dB</p><p>



	a factor of 0.5 in intensity is -3 dB</p><p>



	a factor of 10 in intensity is + 10 dB</p><p>



	a factor of 0.1 in intensity is -10 dB</p><p>



	a factor of 2 in pressure is + 6 dB</p><p>



	a factor of 0.5 in pressure is -6 dB</p><p>



	a factor of 10 in pressure is + 20 dB</p><p>



	a factor of 0.1 in pressure is -20dB</p><p>

	In understanding intensity levels and sound pressure levels,

it is important to note that the decibel scale is a ratio of power

or energy, no matter what quantities are being ratioed.  A problem

commonly arising in acoustic calculations is that of obtaining the

overall intensity level after the individual intensities within the

applicable bandwidths have been calculated.  Such a situation is

encountered in calculating a term in the sonar equations (to be

discussed later) called noise level, which is actually a

combination of ambient noise and self-noise.  Because we are

dealing with decibels, it is not possible to merely add similar

intensity levels together and work with their sum.  For example,

two 30 dB signals combine to give a total intensity level of 33 dB,

not 60 dB as might be expected.  The reason for this is that, as

shown above, doubling the intensity is represented in decibels by

a + 3 dB change.  The process is more complicated when dealing with

levels of unequal value.  Figure 8-2 can be used to determine the

dB increase above a level of IL1, in terms of the difference IL1 -

IL2, to be expected when IL1 and IL2 are combined.  This process can

be expanded to include any number of intensity levels.  However, when dealing with more than two intensities, it is often easier to

use anti-logs, to convert each IL back to its intensity units, add

all the intensities together, then reconvert to dB levels.  Either

method may be used and should result in the same numerical value of

noise level.</p><p>



</p><p>



	Although standardization has been reached for measuring

intensities, such is not the case for other quantities.  Ranges are

Temperatures are commonly specified in degrees Fahrenheit or

degrees Celsius.  These diverse units should warn the user to

exercise due caution when discussing the various facets of

underwater sound to ensure that misunderstandings do not occur.  In

this text, the SI units of measure will be used wherever possible.</p><p>



</p><p>



8.4  <b>SPEED OF SOUND IN THE SEA</b></p><p>



</p><p>



From physics it will be remembered that when gas is the

transmitting medium, the denser the gas, the slower the speed of

sound, and yet the speed of sound in water is about four times

greater than that in air.  Although this seems contradictory, it is

not, because there is another more important factor that influences

the speed of sound.  In truth, the speed of sound is determined

primarily by the elasticity of the medium and only secondarily by

the density.</p><p>



</p><p>



8.4.1  <b>Bulk Modulus</b></p><p>



</p><p>



Elasticity is defined as that property of a body that causes it to

resist deformation and to recover its original shape and size when

the deforming forces are removed.  Of specific concern is volume

elasticity or <u>bulk modulus</u> - that is, the ratio of force per unit

area (stress) to the change in volume per unit volume (strain).  </p><p>



</p><p>



Thus,</p><p>



</p><p>



                    Bulk Modulus = <u>Stress</u></p><p>



                                   Strain</p><p>



</p><p>



	In order to bring about a change in the volume of a liquid, it

is necessary to exert a force of much greater magnitude than is

required to bring about an equivalent change in the same volume of

air.  Therefore, the value of bulk modulus is much greater for a

liquid than for a gas.  This bit of information, however, is

meaningless until it is applied in the formula for the speed of

sound.</p><p>



</p><p>



	The speed of sound, c, in a fluid is equal to the square root

of the ratio of bulk modulus to density.  Thus,</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



                    c =   <u>Bulk Modulus</u>                 (8-10)</p><p>



                            Density</p><p>



</p><p>



	Although seawater is almost a thousand times denser than air,

the enormous bulk modulus of water is the more important factor

determining sound speed.  Of concern, however, are not the

differences of the two mediums but the conditions in water that

cause changes in sound speed.  Contrary to the assumptions made up

to this point, the ocean is not a homogeneous medium, and the speed

of sound varies from point to point in the ocean.  This variation

in sound speed is one of the most important characteristics

affecting the transmission of sound.  The three main environmental

factors affecting the speed of sound in the ocean are salinity,

pressure, and temperature.</p><p>



</p><p>



8.4.2  <b>Salinity</b></p><p>



</p><p>



Salinity, which on the average ranges from 32 to 38 parts per

thousand (ppt), is fairly constant in the open ocean.  A change of

salinity will cause a small corresponding change in density with a

resulting change in bulk modulus, causing variation of sound speed. 

The greatest variation in salinity in the open ocean exists in the

vicinity of "oceanic fronts," which are narrow zones separating

water masses of different physical characteristics, usually

exhibiting very large horizontal gradients of temperature and

salinity (figure 8-3).  Even greater variation in salinity can be

expected around the mouths of rivers, heavy ice, and in areas of

extraordinary rainfall (e.g., the monsoon) where a layer of fresh

water overrides a layer of salt water.  A change in salinity of one part per thousand will result in a change in sound speed of

approximately 1.3 meters per second.</p><p>



</p><p>

</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



8.4.3  <b>Pressure</b></p><p>



</p><p>



Pressure in most circumstances is more important than salinity, but

in the sea its change is constant and thus predictable.  It also

causes a change in bulk modulus and density, and the result is an

increase in sound speed of 0.017 m/sec for every meter of depth

increase.  This slight change, which is important when temperature

remains constant, causes a sound beam to bend upward at great

depths as will be discussed later.</p><p>



</p><p>



8.4.4  <b>Temperature</b></p><p>



</p><p>



Temperature, the foremost factor affecting sound speed, usually

decreases with depth, and this leads to an accompanying decrease in

sound speed at the rate of approximately 3 m/sec per degree

Celsius.  Below a depth of about 1,000 m, however, temperature is</p><p>



fairly constant, and the predominant factor affecting sound speed

becomes pressure.  At first glance it would seem that a temperature

decrease would increase sound speed due to the increased water

density, but not so.  As the temperature of a medium decreases,

bulk modulus decreases while density increases.  Considering these

effects in terms of the sound speed formula in equation (8-10), it

is clear that a decrease in temperature brings an attendant

decrease in sound speed.  It also should be noted that temperature

differs bulk modulus and density at a variable rate.  A change in

temperature at one point on the scale, therefore, affects sound

speed differently than an equal change at another point on the

scale.  It should be noted that the effect of temperature is

relatively large compared to the other factors.  It takes a depth

change of about 165 meters to cause the same change in sound speed

as a one-degree temperature change.  As will be discussed, temperature is therefore the only factor normally measured and

evaluated under operational conditions.</p><p>



</p><p>



8.4.5  <b></b><b>Sound Speed Equation</b></p><p>



</p><p>



Dealing with these three factors to arrive at values for bulk

modulus and <b></b>density, and thence sound speed, is very cumbersome. 

To overcome this, numerous empirical relationships have been

developed for converting the three factors directly to sound speed. 

A simplified version of such sound speed equations developed by

Wilson in 1960 is present below.</p><p>



</p><p>



				c = 1449 + 4.6T + 0.055T2 + 0.003T3</p><p>



                    + (1.39 - 0.012T)(S - 35) + 0.017d      (8-11)</p><p>



where</p><p>



	</p><p>



			T = temperature in degrees Celsius</p><p>



			S = salinity in parts per thousand</p><p>



			d = depth in meters</p><p>



</p><p>



	Given accurate temperature, salinity, and depth data, this

equation is accurate within 0.6 meters/sec, 96 percent of the time. 

By way of contrast, the equation for the speed of sound in air is

approximately</p><p>



	</p><p>



				c = 331.6 + 0.6T</p><p>



</p><p>



	In making calculations involving the transmission of sound

through the sea, it frequently is adequate to use a standard speed

rather than the more accurate value given by equation 8-11. 

Although in seawater c can vary from a low of about 1,420 m/s to

over 1,560 m/s depending on environmental conditions, a standard

speed of 1,500 m/s may be assumed for computation purposes unless

otherwise noted.</p><p>



</p><p>



8.4.6  <b>Field Observations of Sound Speed</b></p><p>



</p><p>



Knowledge of sound velocity is important to the ASW tactician and

physical oceanographer because of the effect that variations in

sound velocity have upon acoustic absorption and refraction.  Two

different devices are in use today for finding the speed of sound

in the sea.</p><p>



</p><p>



8.4.6.1  Bathythermograph.  The first device is called a bathy-thermograph.  As previously stated, temperature is the predominant

ocean variable affecting sound speed.  Not only is it relatively

easy to measure, but when applied to empirical relationships such

as equation (8-11), sound speed can be computed.  Older BT systems

employed a mechanical device that was lowered on a cable and the

temperature was scribed on a smoked piece of glass.  This had a

number of inherent disadvantages that have been overcome through

the development of the expendable bathythermograph (XBT), which

does not require retrieval of the sensing unit.  A diagram view of

an XBT is shown in figure 8-4.  It consists of a thermistor probe that is ejected from the launching platform and sinks at a known

non-linear rate.  The XBT is connected to a special recorder on

board the launching platform by a fine wire.  As it sinks, ther

thermistor changes its electrical resistance with changing

temperature, and as a result a temperature vs. depth trace is

obtained.  Because the wire uncoils from both the probe and its

launcher, there is no tension on the wire until the probe has sunk

to its full depth.  At this point, the wire snaps and the recording

stops.  Variants of the basic XBT have been developed for use

aboard submarines and from aircraft through incorporation into

sonobuoys.</p><p>

</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



	When the XBT temperature vs. depth trace is converted to sound

speed vs. depth, it produces a sound speed profile very similar to

that obtainable from a sound velocimeter, and is of sufficient

accuracy for operational requirements.</p><p>

</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



8.4.6.2  Sound Velocimeter</p><p>



</p><p>



The second and most accurate method is the sound velocimeter.  Its

principle advantage is that it can measure sound speed directly,

without need for conversions, by transmitting a pulse of sound over

a very short path on the order of 1/2 meter or less.  When the

pulse arrives at the receiver, another pulse is then triggered from

the transmitter; this is known as the "sing-around" or "howler"

principle.  The faster the speed of sound in the water in which the

velocimeter is submerged, the faster the pulse will travel and the

sooner it will arrive at the receiver to trigger the succeeding

pulse.  Since nearly all the time delay between pulses occurs as

acoustic delay in the water, the PRF of the pulses is determined by

the local sound speed and is directly proportional to it.  Thus,

knowing the path length and observing the PRF can lead directly to

computation of sound speed.  Until recently sound velocimeters were

expensive and awkward to use, thus eliminating their use tactical-ly.  The recent development of the expendable sound velocimeter

(XSV) has made it possible to reduce sound velocity measurement er-rors to less than .25 meters per second at reasonable expense with-out reduction of the mobility of combatant units.  Today's sophis-ticated sonars and acoustic navigation systems can provide improved

information in many oceanic regions when actual sound-velocity pro-files are used rather than extrapolated sound velocity values based

on temperature profiles and assumed salinity data.  Based on the

variability in the sea with time, a policy of regular periodic mea-surement of the velocity profile is required during an ASW opera-tion.  Normally, one or two ships in the force are assigned the

bathythermograph guard duty.  These ships periodically measure the

temperature or velocity profile, and promulgate it to all ASW units

in company.  These sound velocity profiles are essential in deter-mining the sound propagation paths available.</p><p>



</p><p>



8.4.7  <b>Typical Sound Speed Profiles</b></p><p>



</p><p>



It is important to remember that while temperature is the dominant

factor, the sound-speed profile is really a composite of the

pressure, salinity, and temperature profiles as shown in </p><p>



figure 8-6.  In the area of ocean fronts, where salinity may vary

up to 3 ppt. from assumed values, the use of temperature data alone

may result in an error of up to 4.2 meters per second in the

calculation of sound speed.</p><p>

	A typical composite deep-sea sound-speed profile is shown in

greater detail in figure 8-7.  The profile may be divided into four

major layers each having different thermal characteristics.  Just

below the sea surface is the surface layer, in which the speed of

sound is susceptible to daily and local changes of heating,

cooling, and wind action.  The surface layer may contain isothermal

water that is formed due to mixing by the action of wind as it

blows across the water.  Below the surface layer lies the seasonal

thermocline - the word "thermocline" denoting a layer in which the

temperature changes rapidly with depth.  The seasonal thermocline

is characterized by a negative sound-speed gradient that varies

with the seasons.  During the summer and fall, when the near-surface waters of the sea are warm, the seasonal thermocline is

strong and well defined; during the winter and spring, and in the

Arctic, it tends to merge with, and be indistinguishable from, the

surface layer.  Underlying the seasonal thermocline is the

permanent thermocline, which is affected only slightly by seasonal

changes.  Below the permanent thermocline and extending to the sea

bottom is the deep isothermal layer, having a nearly constant temperature of about 4oC, in which the speed of sound has a</p><p>



positive gradient because of the effect of pressure on sound speed. 

</p><p>



	Between the negative speed gradient of the permanent

thermocline and the positive gradient of the deep isothermal layer,

there is a speed minimum toward which sound traveling at great

depths tends to be bent or focused by refraction.  This is the deep

sound channel and will be discussed later.  The refraction of

sound, however, is much more complex than this simple four-layer

ocean model would indicate.  There are ocean eddies, fronts,

interfaces between currents, underwater mountains and ridges.  For

instance, a submarine detected in the Labrador Current but crossing

into the Gulf Stream has been compared to a person going out of an

open field and disappearing into the nearby woods.	</p><p>



</p><p>



8.5  <b>RAY THEORY</b></p><p>



</p><p>



The propagation of sound in an elastic medium can be described

mathematically by solutions of the wave equation using the ap-propriate boundary and medium conditions for a particular problem. 

The wave equation is a partial differential equation relating the

acoustic pressure P to the coordinate x, y, z, and the time t, and

may be written as</p><p>



                    <u>2P</u> = c2 (<u>2P</u> + <u>2P</u> + <u>2P</u>)          (8-12)</p><p>



                    t2      (x2   y2   z2)</p><p>



8.5.1  <b>Normal-Mode Theory </b></p><p>



There are two theoretical approaches to a solution of the wave

equation.  One is called normal-mode theory, in which the prop-agation is described in terms of characteristic functions called

normal modes, each of which is a solution of the equation.  The

normal modes are combined additively to satisfy the boundary and

source conditions of interest.  The result is a complicated math-ematical function which, though adequate for computations on a

digital computer, gives little insight, compared to ray theory, on

the distribution of the energy of the source in space and time. 

Normal-mode theory is well suited for a description of sound prop-agation in shallow water, but will not be discussed in this text.</p><p>



</p><p>



8.5.2  <b>Ray Acoustics</b></p><p>



</p><p>



The other form of solution of the wave equation is ray theory, and

the body of results and conclusions therefrom is called ray acous-tics.  The essence of ray theory is (1) the postulate of wave </p><p>



fronts, along which the phase or time function of the solution is

constant, and (2) the existence of rays that describe where in

space the sound emanating from the source is being sent.  Like its

analog in optics, ray acoustics has considerable intuitive appeal

and presents a picture of the propagation in the form of the ray

diagram.</p><p>



</p><p>



	For almost all operational problems, the sound-speed gradient,

with respect to horizontal changes of location, can be assumed to be zero.  The major gradient of interest is the vertical gradient,

dc/dz, where dz is the amount of depth change.  If a source of

sound at the surface of the sea radiates omnidirectionally, a wave

front expanding from this source in all directions transfers energy

from one particle in the water to another, and by this means the

wave is propagated.  If some point on this wave front is selected,

and from it a line is drawn in the direction of energy propagation,

then connecting these points as the wave expands in space will

result in a line called a ray, as illustrated in figure 8-8.</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



	A sound wave, or ray, which enters another medium or layer of

the same medium having a different characteristic impedance, will

undergo an abrupt change in direction and speed.  Depending upon

the angle of incidence and the abruptness of change in c, a

portion of the impinging acoustic energy will be reflected off the

medium boundary, and a portion will be refracted or bent passing </p><p>



through the boundary.  A sound ray will always bend toward the

region of slower sound speed.</p><p>



	One of the most important practical results of ray theory is

Snell's Law, which describes the refraction of waves in mediums of

variable speeds.  Snell's Law states that the angle of incidence,

1, at a boundary is related to the angle of refraction 2, by the

following expression:</p><p>



</p><p>



                         <u>sin 1</u> = <u>c1</u>                    (8-13)</p><p>



                         sin 2   c2</p><p>



</p><p>



where</p><p>



</p><p>



	c1 = sound speed in medium 1</p><p>



     c2 = sound speed in medium 2</p><p>



</p><p>



	If the wave is considered to be passing through three

horizontal layers or strata, in each of which the sound speed is

considered to be constant, then Snell's Law can be rewritten as</p><p>



</p><p>



               <u>  c1   </u> = <u>   c2   </u> = <u>   c3   </u> = <u>   cn   </u>    (8-14)</p><p>



               cos 1    cos 2      cos 3     cos n</p><p>



</p><p>



where</p><p>



</p><p>



	cn = speed of sound at any point in the medium</p><p>



     n = angle made with horizontal at that point</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



	Note that the angle  in equation 8-14 is the complement of

the angle usually expressed in Snell's basic law.  It is commonly

referred to as the grazing angle or angle of inclination.  This

expression is the basis of ray computation used by most computers,

since it enables a particular ray to be "traced out" by following

it through the successive layers into which the speed profile may

have been divided.  In a layered medium having layers of constant

speed, the rays consist of a series of straight-line segments

joined together, in effect, by Snell's Law.</p><p>

</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



	In practice, however, temperature does not change abruptly,

but rather the gradient will normally decrease or increase at a

measurable rate.  For such a situation, the sound speed at any

depth z would be given by</p><p>



</p><p>



                         c(z) = co + gz                 (8-15)</p><p>



where</p><p>



</p><p>



	co = speed at the surface or transducer depth</p><p>



	 g = speed gradient dc/dz between the surface and depth z</p><p>



</p><p>



	The net result is that, in reality, ray traces appear as

curves rather than straight lines.  By combining equations (8-14) and (8-15), an expression can be developed for the radius of

curvature R of any ray at any point along the ray path, as shown by

equation (8-16) and figure 8-11.</p><p>



     </p><p>



</p><p>



                    R = <u>-co</u> = <u>  c  </u>                 (8-16)</p><p>



                         g    gcos</p><p>



</p><p>



Under operational conditions, values of R are very large,

approaching several tens of kilometers.</p><p>

8.6  <b>PROPAGATION PATHS</b><b></b></p><p><b>



</b></p><p>



8.6.1  <b>Thermal Structure</b></p><p>



</p><p>



The thermal structure of the ocean governs the refractive con-ditions for a given water mass.  Despite infinite vertical

temperature variations in the ocean, the temperature structure

normally can be related to three basic types:  (1) isothermal,</p><p>



(2) negative temperature gradient, and (3) positive temperature

gradient.  In discussing sound propagation, it is customary to use

the temperature profile as an indicator of sound speed conditions

at various depths, because it has the greatest effect.  It must be

remembered, however, that changes in sound-beam direction result

from changes in the sound-speed profile, which is influenced not

only by temperature but pressure and salinity as well.</p><p>



</p><p>



8.6.2  <b>Direct Path</b></p><p>



</p><p>



In an isothermal condition, the water's temperature is almost

constant.  If there is a slight decrease in temperature, and it is

just balanced out by the pressure increase, the result is an iso-sound-speed condition.  This causes a straight-line ray, leaving

the source in lines that continue with little or no change in angle.  Long ranges are possible when this type of structure is

present.</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



	When there is a negative temperature gradient, sound speed

decreases with depth, and sound rays bend sharply downward.  This

condition is common near the surface of the sea.  At some horizon-tal distance from the sound source, beyond where the rays bend

downward, is a region in which sound intensity is negligible (fig-ure 8-22); it is called a shadow zone.  The magnitude of the tem-perature gradient determines the amount of bending of the sound

beam and thus the range of the shadow zone.  For example, if the

decrease in temperature to a depth of 10 meters totals 2oC or more,

the shadow zone would begin beyond a horizontal range of 1,000 met-ers due to the sharp curvature of the sound beam.</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



	When the temperature of the water has a positive gradient,

sound speed increases with depth, and sound rays are refracted

upward.</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



	Longer ranges are attained with this temperature structure

than with a negative gradient because the rays are refracted upward

and then reflect off the surface.  Unless the surface of the sea is

very rough, most of the rays are repeatedly reflected at the

surface to longer ranges.</p><p>



	</p><p>



	Circumstances usually produce conditions where combinations of

temperatures occur.  One of these combinations includes a layer of

isothermal water over water with a negative gradient. 

Approximately 90 per cent of all the bathythermograph records from

all over the world show this type of thermal structure.  One ray,

labeled "the critical ray," becomes horizontal at the boundary or

division between the isothermal layer and the negative gradient. 

The speed of sound is a maximum at this boundary point.  </p><p>



</p><p>



	Consequently, we define the layer depth (z) as that depth of

greatest sound speed (c) above the seasonal thermocline (see figure

8-7).  One half of the critical beam bends toward the upper region

at a reduced speed, and the other half bends toward the lower

region at a reduced speed.  The angle that the critical ray makes

with the horizontal at the point of projection is called the

critical angle.</p><p>

</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



	</p><p>



	All rays in the sound beam directed at an angle less than the

critical angle will follow paths entirely within the isothermal

layer and will be bent upward to the surface.  All rays directed at

an angle greater than the critical angle follow paths that

penetrate the boundary and are subsequently refracted downward.  No

rays enter the region bounded by the two branches of the split

critical ray, and for this reason it is also called a shadow zone. 

Sharp shadow zones are not fully developed because of diffraction

and other effects, though the sound intensity in this area is quite

low.  Submarine commanders deliberately use this phenomenon, when

it exists, to attempt to escape detection when approaching a

target.  The optimum depth for close approach to a target with

minimum probability of counter-detection is approximately</p><p>



     </p><p>



	               Best depth = 17  Z                 (8-33)</p><p>



</p><p>



where z is the layer depth in meters.</p><p>



</p><p>



	This is accurate down to a layer depth of 60 meters.  Below

that, the best depth for approach is a constant 60 meters below

layer depth.</p><p>



</p><p>



8.6.3  <b>Convergence Zone</b></p><p>



</p><p>



In the deep ocean, temperature usually decreases with depth to

approximately 1,000 meters.  Deeper than this, temperature is a

constant 4oC and sound speed increases as a result of pressure.  A

negative speed gradient overlays a positive speed gradient,

allowing equal speeds at two different depths with slower speed

conditions in between.  Sound originating in the thermocline,

traveling nearly parallel to the surface initially, thus bends

toward greater depths.  But as the detected sound penetrates into

deep water, it passes the region of minimum sound speed and enters

the deep isothermal layer.  Now the gradient in sound speed

operates in the other direction; the sound path bends upward rather

than downward, and the sound returns to the surface.  This produces

a convergence zone, where the sound waves concentrate as if they

had been focused.  It typically lies at a distance of about fifty

kilometers from the source.  Beyond this convergence zone is a

second zone of silence, where again the acoustic waves diffract

downward; then another convergence zone, fifty kilometers out, and

so forth.  The mapping of these zones is a routine part of

submarine operations; by measuring deep-water temperatures witha

bathythermograph, one obtains data that readily allow a computer to

calculate the appropriate sound-wave paths.</p><p>

</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



	When water with a negative speed gradient overlays a positive

speed gradient, a sound channel is produced.  Under these

circumstances, any sound signal traveling in this area is refracted

back and forth so that it becomes horizontally channeled.  Sound

rays originating with an initial upward inclination are refracted

upward.  Rays from a sound source in this layer that make a small

angle with the horizontal are roughly sinusoidal, crossing and</p><p>



recrossing the layer of minimum speed.  This reinforcement of rays within the sound channel can continue until the sound is absorbed,

scattered, or intercepted by some obstacle.  Sounds traveling in

this manner sometimes are received at extremely great distances

from the source.  These long ranges occur primarily as a result of

two factors:  absorption is small for low-frequency sound and most

of the sound energy from a sound source at the axis is confined to

the channel.</p><p>

</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



	Under certain circumstances, a sound channel can exist near

the surface of the sea.  In a surface layer with a strong positive</p><p>



temperature gradient the upward bending of sound rays combined with

reflections from the surface will form such a channel.  Sonar

ranges many times greater than normal have been observed where

sound channels exist.  However, the conditions that produce such

sound channels near the surface are rare and not very stable.</p><p>



</p><p>



	The region of minimum sound velocity, at a depth exceeding a

kilometer, is the deep sound channel.  It acts as an acoustic

waveguide; sound propagating either upward or downward encounters

sound-velocity gradients and bends back into this channel.  Within

the deep sound channel, sound undergoes only a cylindrical

spreading loss, in which intensity drops off only as the first

power of the distance.  If sound spread uniformly in all

directions, known as spherical spreading, this falloff would follow

the square of the distance.  The concept of cylindrical and

spherical spreading and their importance to sonar is presented in

the next section.  Figure (8-18) shows the ray paths existing for

a deep sound channel.  Rays A and B are bounded by the sound

channel.  Other rays may follow propagation paths that are

reflected at the sea surface and bottom (ray C), or refracted and

reflected from either the sea bottom or the sea surface (rays D and

E).  Ray D is commonly called the refracted surface reflected (RSR)

path, while ray E is called the refracted bottom reflected (RBR)

path.</p><p>

8.6.4  <b>Bottom Bounce</b></p><p>



In addition to being refracted by varying conditions in the medium,

sound can be reflected in the manner of a light beam striking a

mirrorlike surface and lose little of its intensity.  The two

surfaces that can produce this type of reflection are the surface

of the water and the bottom of the ocean.  Rarely if ever are these

surfaces smooth enough to give a mirror reflection, but in many

instances the majority of the sound is reflected as a beam.  Some

sonars make use of this phenomenon which is called bottom bounce. 

A beam is directed against the bottom from which it is reflected to

the surface of the water.  From the surface it is reflected back to

the bottom again.  Thus, the ray bounces from one to the other

until its energy is dissipated or until it strikes a target and

returns to the sonar.  As with reflected light, the angle of

reflection is equal to the angle of incidence.  Obviously, ranging over a fairly flat bottom is more effective than ranging over a

rough or sloping bottom.  This path is highly dependent upon depth

and absorption of sound by the ocean bottom.</p><p>



</p><p>



	It is obvious, then, that many sound paths are available, as

indicated in the composite drawing in figure 8-20.  For simplicity

in the figure, the bottom-bounce path is depicted as a single beam,

whereas in the real world, a wider beam corresponding to a

multidirectional sound source would be the normal case.</p><p>

	The convergence zone path is shown as having depth based on

the concept of a wide sound beam or "bundle" of sound rays

emanating from a source.  By definition, the convergence zone is

formed when the upper ray of the bundle becomes horizontal.  This

is the depth at which the sound velocity is equal to the high of

the velocities at either the surface or at the bottom of the

surface layer.  The difference in depth between the ocean bottom

and the depth at which the upper ray becomes horizontal is called

the depth excess.  The depth excess available defines the depth of

the bundle of rays or "amount of sound" that forms the convergence

zone path.  As the sound energy travels upward and approaches the

surface, the path narrows, tending to focus the sound energy

resulting in convergence gains.  A maximum of 1200 ft depth excess

is required to produce an operational useful convergence zone with

reliable convergence gains.  (As velocity increases with depth, the

corresponding amount by which the velocity of the bottom ray

exceeds that of the top ray in the convergence zone path bundle is

called velocity excess.)  These concepts are depicted in Figure (8-21)</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>

	Although many paths are available, only by observing the

environment carefully and paying close attention to his equipment

will the operator be able to use them to best advantage and not

find them a liability.</p><p>

8.7  <b>SOUND PROPAGATION THROUGH THE SEA</b></p><p>



</p><p>



The sea, together with its boundaries, forms a remarkably complex

medium for the propagation of sound.  It possesses an internal

structure and a peculiar upper and lower surface that create many

diverse effects upon the sound emitted from an underwater source. 

In traveling through the sea, an underwater sound signal becomes

delayed, distorted, and weakened.  The transmission loss term in

the sonar equations expresses the magnitude of these effects.</p><p>



</p><p>



8.7.1  <b>Transmission Loss</b></p><p>



</p><p>



Consider a source of sound located in the sea.  The intensity of

the sound can be measured at any point in the sea, near to or far

from the source.  For purposes of measuring intensity at the

source, the intensity measurement is generally taken at one unit

distance from the source and labeled Io.  The intensity can then be

measured at any distant point where a hydrophone is located and

denoted I.  It is operationally significant to compare the two

values.  One way to do this is to form the ration Io/I.  Note that

if the ratio, denoted n, is greater than unity, the intensity at

the source is greater than at the receiver, as would be expected. 

If n = Io/I, then</p><p>



</p><p>



			10 log n = 10 log Io - 10 log I</p><p>



               = sound intensity level at the source minus sound </p><p>



                 intensity level at the receiver.</p><p>



</p><p>



	The value 10 log n is called the transmission loss and, of

course, is measured in decibels.  Most of the factors that

influence transmission loss have been accounted for by scientific

research, and can be grouped into two major categories:  spreading

and attenuation.</p><p>



</p><p>



8.7.2  <b>Spreading Loss</b></p><p>



</p><p>



To understand spreading loss, it is convenient to imagine a

theoretical ocean that has no boundaries and in which every point has the same physical properties as any other point - i.e., an

infinite, homogeneous medium.  In such a medium, sound energy would

propagate from a point source in all directions along straight

paths and would have a spherical wave front.</p><p>



</p><p>



	Under these conditions the change in power density with

distance from the point source would be due only to the spherical

divergence of energy.  Note that there is no true loss of energy as

might be implied, but rather the energy is simply spread over a

progressively larger surface area, thus reducing its density.  For

this model, the amount of power spread over the surface of a sphere

of radius r, centered at a point source, is expressed by</p><p>



</p><p>



                               <u>Pt(watts)</u>                (8-17)</p><p>



      </p><p>



Power density (watts/m2) at r =   4r2</p><p>



</p><p>



where P, is the acoustic power level immediately adjacent to the

source.  This concept of power density (watts/m2) was used to

develop the radar equation in chapter 2.  As stated before, the

units of acoustic energy are watts/m2.  Therefore, equation 8-17

can be written                                </p><p>



</p><p>



			It =  <u> Pt </u> (watts/m2 = <u>P2</u><u>e</u></p><p>



                     4r2             pc</p><p>



</p><p>



where Pe, is measured at range r, and Pt is the acoustic power level

immediately adjacent to the source.</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



	The intensity of the sound immediately adjacent to the source

is measured, by convention, at a unit distance (1 meter) from the

source.  It will be labeled I1 and is given by</p><p>



</p><p>



                       I1 = <u>  Pt  </u></p><p>



                            4(1)2</p><p>



</p><p>



	The acoustic intensity (Ir) at some distance, r, from the

source will be less than the acoustic intensity (I1) at 1 meter

from the source.  This is the result of spreading a fixed amount of

power over a geometrically increasing surface area (a sphere, figure 8-22).  The reduction of the acoustic intensity as a

function of distance, r, is shown in the ratio</p><p>



</p><p>



                           <u>  Pt  </u></p><p>



                      <u>Ir</u> = <u>4(r)2</u> = <u> 1</u></p><p>



                      I1   <u>  Pt  </u>   r2</p><p>



                           4(1)2</p><p>



</p><p>



However, the ratio Ir to I1 at any significant range is typically

so small that these values are best examined on a logarithmic scale

using the decibel.</p><p>



</p><p>



     10 log <u>Ir</u> = 10 log <u> 1</u> = 10 log(1) - 10 log r2 = -20 log r</p><p>



            I1          r2</p><p>



</p><p>



or</p><p>



</p><p>



                10 log Ir = 10 log I1 - 20 log r</p><p>



</p><p>



The reduction in acoustic intensity (I1) due to range (spreading) </p><p>



is called the transmission loss (TL), and for spherical spreading</p><p>



</p><p>



                     TL = 20 log r (r in meters)         (8-18)</p><p>



</p><p>



and</p><p>



</p><p>



                     10 log Ir = 10 log I1 - TL</p><p>



</p><p>



	The ocean is not an unbounded medium, however, and all sources

are not omnidirectional point sources.  For sources that radiate

energy only in a horizontal direction, sound energy diverges more

like the surface of an expanding cylinder.  Also, since the ocean

is bounded at the surface and bottom, cylindrical divergence is

usually assumed for ranges that are large compared to the depth of

the water or for when sound energy is trapped within a thermal

layer or sound channel.  For this model, the acoustic intensity of

energy at the surface of a cylinder of radius r is expressed by</p><p>



</p><p>



                       Ir = <u> Pt </u> watts/m2               (8-19)</p><p>



                            2rh</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



where h is the vertical distance between upper and lower boundaries</p><p>



(see figure 8-22).  The transmission loss is therefore</p><p>



</p><p>



     10 log <u>Ir</u> = 10 log <u>1</u> = 10 log (1) - 10 log r = - 10 log r</p><p>



            I1          r</p><p>



</p><p>



or</p><p>



                    l0 log Ir = 10 log I1 - 10 log r</p><p>



</p><p>



or</p><p>



</p><p>



                           TL = 10 log r                 (8-20)</p><p>



</p><p>



and</p><p>



</p><p>



                       10 log Ir = 10 log I1 - TL</p><p>



</p><p>



Equation (8-20) represents cylindrical divergence of sound energy,

sometimes referred to as inverse first power spreading.  Except at

short ranges, it is the most commonly encountered type of spreading

loss.  It should be noted that the loss of intensity of a sound

wave due to spreading is a geometrical phenomenon and is

independent of frequency.  As range increases, the percentage of

intensity lost for a given distance traveled becomes increasingly

less.</p><p>



</p><p>



8.7.3  <b>Attenuation Loss</b></p><p>



</p><p>



Attenuation of sound energy in seawater arises principally through

the action of two independent factors, absorption and scattering,

with an additional contribution from bottom loss.</p><p>



</p><p>



8.7.3.1  Absorption.  The primary causes of absorption have been

attributed to several processes, including viscosity, thermal con-ductivity, and chemical reactions involving ions in the seawater. 

(1)  The viscosity of the medium causes sound energy to be convert-ed into heat by internal friction.  (2)  Some sound energy is con-verted into heat because sound waves alternately raise and lower

the temperatures.  (3)  Suspended particles are set to oscillating

by the sound waves and in this process some of the sound energy is

dissipated in the form of heat.  This is especially the case if the

particles are air bubbles.   While each of these factors offers its

own unique contribution to the total absorption loss, all of them

are caused by the repeated pressure fluctuations in the medium as

the sound waves are propagated.  They involve a process of conver-sion of acoustic energy into heat and thereby represent a true loss

of acoustic energy to the environment.</p><p>



</p><p>



	Experimentation has produced a factor , called the absorption

coefficient, which when multiplied by the range gives the total

loss in dB due to absorption.  Water temperature and the amount of

magnesium sulphate (MgSO4) are important factors influencing the

magnitude of , because the colder the average water temperature

and the greater the amount of MgSO4 present, the greater will be

the losses due to absorption.  However, it is the frequency of the

sound wave that causes the most significant variation in the

absorption coefficient.  While the formula will change slightly

with temperature and geographical location, an equation for the

value of  in decibels per meter for seawater at 5oC is</p><p>



</p><p>



                     = <u> 0.036f2 </u> + 3.2 x 10-7f2         (8-21)</p><p>



                        f2 + 3600</p><p>



where</p><p>



	  f = frequency in kHz</p><p>



</p><p>



	While this formula is rather cumbersome, the important thing

to observe is that  increases roughly as the square of the frequency.  This relationship is of major importance to the naval

tactician.  It tells him that if higher frequencies are chosen for

sonar operation in order to achieve greater target definition, the

price he must pay is greater attenuation.  The higher the

frequency, the greater the attenuation and the less the range of

detection.  For this reason, where long-range operation of sonar

equipment is desired, the lower the frequency used the better. 

Figure 8-23 depicts typical values of the absorption coefficient of

seawater at 5oC for varying frequencies.</p><p>



	</p><p>



	To obtain the transmission loss due to absorption,  is merely

multiplied by the range in meters.  Thus,</p><p>



                           </p><p>



					 TL = r                        (8-22)</p><p>

</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



8.7.3.2  Scattering</p><p>



</p><p>



Another form of attenuation is scattering, which results when sound

strikes foreign bodies in the water, and the sound energy is re-flected.  Some reflectors are boundaries (surface, bottom, and

shores), bubbles, suspended solid and organic particles, marine </p><p>



life, and minor inhomogeneities in the thermal structure of the

ocean.  The amount of energy scattered is a function of the size,

density, and concentration of foreign bodies present in the sound

path, as well as the frequency of the sound wave.  The larger the

area of the reflector compared to the sound wavelength, the more

effective it is as a scatterer.  Part of the reflected sound is re-turned to the source as an echo, i.e, is backscattered, and the re-mainder is reflected off in another direction and is lost energy. 

Back-scattered energy is known as reverberation and is divided into

three types:  volume, surface and bottom.</p><p>



</p><p>



	Volume reverberation is caused by various reflectors, but fish

and other marine organisms are the major contributors.  Additional

causes are suspended solids, bubbles, and water masses of markedly

different temperatures.  Volume reverberation is always present during active sonar operations, but is not normally a serious

factor in masking target echoes.  The one exception involves the

deep scattering layer (DSL), which is a relatively dense layer of

marine life present in most areas of the ocean.  During daylight

hours, the layer is generally located at depths of about 600 meters

and does not pose a serious problem.  At night, however, the layer

migrates toward the surface and becomes a major source of

reverberation.  It is rarely opaque to sound when detected with a

sonar looking down on it from directly above, as with a fathometer,

but this is not the case with a search sonar transmitting in a more

or less horizontal direction.  By pinging horizontally, the sound

waves encounter many more organisms, and the effect can vary from

partial transmission of sound to total reflection and scattering,

thereby hiding a submarine.</p><p>



</p><p>



	Surface reverberation is generated when transmitted sound rays

strike the surface of the ocean, i.e., the underside of the waves. 

It is always a factor in active sonar operations, and is directly

related to wind speed because it controls wave size and the angle

of incidence.</p><p>



</p><p>



	Bottom reverberation occurs whenever a sound pulse strikes the

ocean bottom.  In deep water this condition normally does not cause

serious problems, but in shallow water, bottom reverberation can

dominate the background and completely mask a close target.  The

amount of energy lost through scattering will vary with the

roughness of the bottom and the frequency of the incident sound.</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



	Sound reflected from the ocean floor usually suffers a

significant loss in intensity.  Part of this loss is caused by the

scattering effects just described, but most of it results from the

fact that a portion of sound energy will enter the bottom and

travel within it as a new wave, as illustrated in figure 8-24.  The

net result is that the strength of the reflected wave is greatly

reduced.  The amount of energy lost into the bottom varies with the

bottom composition, sound frequency, and the striking angle of the

sound wave.  The total of these losses can vary from as low as 2

dB/bounce to greater than 30 dB/bounce.  In general, bottom loss

will tend to increase with frequency and with the angle of

incidence.  Soft bottoms such as mud are usually associated with

high bottom losses (10 to 30 dB/bounce); hard bottoms such as

smooth rock or sand produce lower losses.</p><p>



</p><p>



	While it is possible to derive equations that will compute

precise values of TL, associated with each of these additional

scattering and bottom loss factors, the ocean characteristics are

so variable that there is little utility in doing so.  It is

customary, therefore, in operational situations, to make an

educated guess as to their values and lump them together into one

term "A," known as the transmission loss anomaly, which is included

in the transmission loss equation.</p><p>



</p><p>



8.7.4  <b>Total Propagation Loss</b></p><p>



</p><p>



It would be useful to have a simple mathematical relationship that

would describe all the effects of the various factors influencing

transmission loss as they occur in the ocean.  But the state of the

physical conditions encountered in the ocean are very complex and

not at all easy to represent.  A few mathematical models do exist

that provide close approximations for some sets of conditions, but

at present, no single model accounts for all the conditions

encountered.</p><p>



</p><p>



	A simplified model used to obtain approximate values of

transmission loss for the spherical spreading case is</p><p>



</p><p>



                    TL = 20 log r + r + A             (8-23)</p><p>

</p><p>



	It is important to realize that sound transmission in the

ocean is three-dimensional and that transmission loss versus

horizontal range alone is not sufficient information for most

operational situations.  Areas of no sonar coverage occur at

various intervals of range because of refraction, reflection, and

interference between waves traveling via different paths. 

Therefore, while the TL equations are interesting and somewhat

useful, they are not always totally accurate.</p><p>



</p><p>



8.8  <b>SOUND SOURCES AND NOISE</b><b></b></p><p><b>



</b></p><p>



Background noise, like reverberation, interferes with the reception

of desired echoes.  Unlike reverberation, however, it does not

result from unwanted echoes of the transmitted pulse but from

active noise-makers located in the ship or in the water.</p><p>



</p><p>



	Noise produced by these sources is classified as self-noise

and ambient noise.  Self-noise is associated with the electronic

and mechanical operation of the sonar and the ship.  Ambient noise

encompasses all of the noises in the sea.</p><p>



</p><p>



8.8.1  <b>Self-Noise</b></p><p>



</p><p>



Self-noise is produced by noisy tubes and components in the sonar

circuitry, water turbulence around the housing of the transducer, loose structural parts of the hull, machinery, cavitation, and

hydrodynamic noises caused by the motion of the ship through the

water.</p><p>



</p><p>



8.8.1.1  Machinery Noise.  The dominant source of machinery noise

in a ship is its power plant and the power distribution system that

supplies power to the other machinery on the vehicle, such as

compressors, generators, propellers, etc.  Machinery noise is

normally always present and is kept to a minimum by acoustically

isolating the various moving mechanical components.</p><p>



</p><p>



	The gearing connecting the propellers is an important source

of machinery noise.  If the engine runs at a relatively low speed,

as is the case with a reciprocating heat engine, gears may not be

required between the engine and the propeller.  High-speed power

sources, however, such as steam or gas turbines, usually require

reduction gears to the propeller.  The frequency of the explosions

in the cylinders of a reciprocating engine is not likely to be a

source of ultrasonic (above 15 kHz) noise but might be an important

source of low-frequency sonic noise.  A more crucial source of

noise in the reciprocating engine is the clatter of the valves

opening and closing.  In gas turbines, the noise generated is in

the ultrasonic region at a radian frequency equal to the angular

velocity of the turbine buckets.</p><p>



</p><p>



	Noise in the ultrasonic region is extremely important in sonar

and acoustic torpedo performance.  The noise produced by auxiliary

units, such as pumps, generators, servos, and even relays, is often

more significant than the power-plant noise.  The large masses

involved in the power plant usually keep noise frequencies

relatively low.  For this reason, a small relay may interfere more

with the operation of a torpedo than an electric motor that

generates several horsepower.  Small, high-speed servomotors,

however, may be serious sources of ultrasonic noise.</p><p>



</p><p>



8.8.1.2  Flow Noise.  Flow noise results when there is relative

motion between an object and the water around it.  This flow is

easiest to understand by assuming that the object is stationary and

that the water is moving past it.  Under ideal conditions such that

the object is perfectly streamlined and smooth, water movement will

be even and regular from the surface outward as shown by the flow

lines in figure 8-25A.  This idealized condition is called laminar

flow and produces no self-noise.  Irregular objects can achieve

nearly laminar flow conditions only at very low speeds (i.e., 1 or

2 knots or below).</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



	As flow speed increases, friction between the object and the

water increases, resulting in turbulence (figure 8-25B) and

progressively increasing noise due to fluctuating static pressure

in the water.  Thus we have, in effect, a noise field.  If a

hydrophone is placed in such a region, fluctuations of pressure

will occur on its face, and it will measure the result in flow

noise in the system.</p><p>



</p><p>



	As pressures fluctuate violently at any one point within the

eddy, they also fluctuate violently from point to point inside the

eddy.  Moreover, at any given instant the average pressure of the

eddy as a whole differs but slightly from the static pressure. 

Thus, very little noise is radiated outside the area of turbulence,

and although a ship-mounted hydrophone may be in an intense flow-noise field, another hydrophone at some distance from the ship may

be unable to detect the noise at all.  Flow noise, then, is almost

exclusiverly a self-noise problem.</p><p>



</p><p>



	Actually, not much information is known about flow noise, but

these general statements may be made about its effect on a

shipborne sonar:</p><p>



</p><p>



	1.  It is a function of speed with a sharp threshold.  At very

low speeds there is no observable flow noise.  A slight increase in

speed changes the flow pattern from laminar to turbulent, and

strong flow noise is observed immediately.  Further increases in

speed step up the intensity of the noise.</p><p>



	2.  It is essentially a low-frequency noise.</p><p>



	3.  It has very high levels within the area of turbulence, but

low levels in the radiated field.  In general, the noise field is

strongest at the surface of the moving body, decreasing rapidly

with distance from the surface.</p><p>



	4.  The amount of flow noise can be related to the degree of

marine fouling on the ship's bottom and sonar dome.  Fouling is the

attachment and growth of marine animals and plants upon submerged

objects.  More than 2,000 species have been recorded, but only

about 50 to 100 species are the major troublemakers.  These nuis-ances can be divided into two groups - those with shells and those

without.  Particularly important of the shell forms are tube-worms,

barnacles, and mollusks because they attach firmly and resist being

torn loose by water action.  Nonshelled forms such as algae, hy-droids, and tunicates commonly attach to relatively stationary ob-jects and therefore do not cuase much trouble on ships that fre-quently get underway.</p><p>



</p><p>



	Most fouling organisms reproduce by means of the fertilization

of eggs by sperm, and the resulting larvae drift with the currents. 

Depending on the species, the larval stage may vary from a few

hours to several weeks.  Unless the larvae attach themselves to a

suitable surface during this period, they will not grow into

adulthood.</p><p>



</p><p>



	Geography governs fouling by isolating species with natural

barriers.  Temperature is the most important factor governing distribution of individual species, limiting reproduction or

killing adults.</p><p>



</p><p>



	On a local scale, salinity, pollution, light, and water

movement affect the composition and development of fouling

communities.  Most fouling organisms are sensitive to variations in

salinity, developing best at a normal seawater concentrations of 30

to 35 parts per thousand.  Pollution, depending on type, may

promote or inhibit fouling.  Fouling algae and microscopic plants,

the food supply of many fouling animals, are dependent upon

sufficient light for proper growth.</p><p>



</p><p>



	To forestall fouling on ship bottoms and sonar domes, the Navy

uses special paints with antifouling ingredients.  The most common

active ingredient of antifouling paint is cuprous oxide, and the

effective life of the paint is from 2 to 2 1/2 years.</p><p>



</p><p>



8.8.1.3  Cavitation.  As the speed of the ship or object is

increased, the local pressure drops low enough at some points

behind the object to allow the formation of steam.  This decrease

in pressure and the resulting bubbles of vapor represent the onset

of cavitation.  As the ship moves away from the bubbles, however,

the pressure increases, causing the bubbles to collapse and produce

a continuous, sharp, hissing noise signal that is very audible.</p><p>



</p><p>



	Because the onset of cavitation is related to the speed of the

object, it is logical that cavitation first appears at the tips of

the propeller blades, inasmuch as the speed of the blade tips is

considerably greater than the propeller hub.  This phenomenon,

known as blade-tip cavitation, is illustrated in figure 8-26.</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



	As the propeller speed increases, a greater portion of the

propeller's surface is moving fast enough to cause cavitation, and

the cavitating area begins to move down the trailing edge of the

blade.  As the speed increases further, the entire back face of the

blade commences cavitating, producing what is known as sheet

cavitation, as shown in figure 8-27.</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



	The amplitude and frequency of cavitation noise are affected

considerably by changing speeds, and changing depth in the case of

a submarine.  As speed increases, so does cavitation noise.  As

depth increases, the cavitation noise decreases and moves to the

higher frequency end of the spectrum in much the same manner as

though speed had been decreased.  This decrease in noise is caused

by the increased pressure with depth, which inhibits the formation

of cavitation bubbles.</p><p>



</p><p>



	A given propeller at a given depth of submergence will produce

no bubbles unless its speed exceeds a certain critical value.  When

the speed (RPM) exceeds this critical value the number of bubbles

formed increases rapidly, but not according to any known law.  The

critical speed itself, however, depends in a simple manner on the

depth of the propeller beneath the sea surface.  This dependence is

given by</p><p>



</p><p>



				<u>No2</u> = constant          No - critical speed</p><p>



                     d                       d - depth</p><p>



</p><p>



	Thus, if a given propeller begins to cavitate at 50 rpm when

at a depth of 15 ft, it will begin to cavitate at 100 rpm when at

a depth of 60 ft.                     </p><p>



</p><p>



	Since all torpedo homing systems and many sonar systems

operate in the ultrasonic region, cavitation noise is a serious

problem.  Torpedoes generally home on the cavitation noise produced

by ships, and any cavitation noise produced by the torpedo

interferes with the target noise it receives.  Because the speed at

which a vehicle can operate without cavitating increases as the

ambient pressure is increased, some acoustic torpedoes are designed

to search and attack from depths known to be below the cavitating

depth.  In the same way, a submarine commander, when under attack,

will attempt to dive to depths at which he can attain a relatively

high speed without producing cavitation.</p><p>



</p><p>



8.8.1.4  <b>Quieting</b></p><p>



</p><p>



It is important for an ASW vessel to operate with a very low noise

level.  Noise reduction methods can be applied to other military

vessels, and to that matter to commercial vessels.  For protection

against acoustic mines and to reduce the risk of being detected

early by sonar listening devices, noise minimizing is necessary. 

A low level of noise also permits own ship to receive a lower level

of signal from the enemy.  Strict levels on the limits of

structureborne noise and of airborne noise levels improve the

habitability for the ship's crew.</p><p>



</p><p>



8.8.1.4.1  Surface Quieting.  Considerations must be given to noise

emission planning in design of the ship.  Attention must be paid to

the layout of the propellers and the hull's appendages with regard

to waterborne noise generation.  Model tests on propellers are

necessary to check cavitation and to shift the cavitation point to

a relatively high speed.  Above this speed a propeller air emission system can be used to reduce cavitation-generated waterborne noise. 

In the U.S. this bubble injection system is called Prairie Masker. 

Prairie is an acronym for propeller air-induced emission.  A system

on some U.S. vessels for injecting air through hull girths is

called Masker.  This reduces somewhat the flow noise.  See figure

8-28.</p><p>

</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



	Other measures can be taken to reduce noise:</p><p>



</p><p>



	- Reducation in structure borne noise transmission through the

provision of low tuned flexible mounts for critical items combined

with high impedance foundations.</p><p>



	- Encapsulation of all diesel prime movers, compressors and

the gas turbines.  Provision of high attenuation silencers for the

exhaust ducts of all diesel prime movers and the gas turbines as

well as for the combustion air inlets of the cruising diesels and

the gas turbines.</p><p>



</p><p>



	Special attention must be paid to diesel units, the

compressors, and converters positioned near the ship's sonar.  As

those are considered to be the most critical structureborne noise

sources, they have been double elastic-mounted.  In addition, the

intermediate foundation frame structure of the diesel units is

damped with reinforced concrete blocks at the foundation springs.</p><p>



</p><p>



	The design of the main reduction gear units is important to

noise reduction.  The rotating parts and meshes were machined to

the highest accuracy to minimize gear contact noise.  The reduction

gear assemblies are hard elastic-mounted.  In the design of elastic

mounts attention must be paid to tuning with regard to the potential vibration exciting sources of the ship and its equipment. 

The behavior of the mounts under shock and rough sea conditions has

to be examined. </p><p>



</p><p>



8.8.1.4.2  Submarine Quieting.  Self noise is a limiting factor in

sonar performance, both from a counter detection point of view, the

point at which an ememy is able to detect you, and with respect to

target detection and tracking.  Thus, there has been a strong trend

toward building quieter submarines.</p><p>



</p><p>



	Significant improvement was realized in using a "bed plate" or

acoustically-isolated foundation for the gears, turbines, condens-ers and turbo generators of the propulsion plant.  Its noise-iso-lating mountings, however, added a good deal of volume and weight

when compared with the conventional alternative of mounting the

machinery directly to the hull.</p><p>



</p><p>



	The reduction gearing, which converts the horsepower of the

rapidly-rotating turbine shaft to that of the slowly-rotating

propeller, is a particularly strong noise source.  An attempt was

made to replace this gearing with a heavy but quiet turbine-electric drive system, featuring a turbo generator that drives a

low-noise electric motor of low rotational speed and high torque. 

This arrangement, however, proved to be less efficient than the

standard geared-turbine system.</p><p>



</p><p>



	Significant headway has been made in reducing propeller cavit-ation.  However, recent advances in submarine quieting, due to im-provements in propeller fabrication, have been neutralized as this

technology has been more widely disseminated than hoped.  </p><p>



</p><p>



	Further silencing gains have been found in the use of a natur-al-circulation nuclear reactor, pump-jet propulsors, and hull-mounted sound-absorbing acoustic tiles. </p><p>



</p><p>



8.8.2  <b>Ambient Noise</b></p><p>



</p><p>



Ambient noise is background noise in the sea due to either natural

or man-made causes, and may be divided into four general

categories:  hydrodynamic, seismic, ocean traffic, and biological.</p><p>



</p><p>



8.8.2.1  Hydrodynamic Noise.	Hydrodynamic noise is caused by the

movement of the water itself as a result of tides, winds, currents,

and storms.  The level of hydrodynamic noise present in the sea is

directly related to the condition of the sea surface.  As the

surface becomes agitated by wind or storm, the noise level rises,

reducing detection capability.  Very high hydrodynamic noise levels

caused by severe storms in the general area of the ship can result

in the complete loss of all signal reception.</p><p>



</p><p>



8.8.2.2  Seismic Noise.  Seismic noises are caused by land

movements under or near the sea - as, for example, during an

earthquake.  They are rare and of short duration, and hence will

not be elaborated upon.</p><p>



</p><p>



8.8.2.3  Ocean Traffic.	Ocean traffic's effect on ambient noise

level is determined by the area's sound propagation

characteristics, the number of ships, and the distance of the

shipping from the area.  Noises caused by shipping are similar to

those discussed under the heading of self-noise, with the

frequencies depending on the ranges to the ships causing the noise. 

Noises from nearby shipping can be heard over a wide spectrum of

frequencies, but as the distance becomes greater, the range of

frequencies becomes smaller, with only the lower frequencies

reaching the receiver because the high frequencies are attenuated. 

In deep water, the low frequencies may be heard for thousands of

kilometers.</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



8.8.2.4  Biological Noise.  Biological noises produced by marine

life are part of ambient background noise and at times are an

important factor in ASW.  Plants and animals that foul the ships

are passive and contribute to self-noise by increasing water

turbulence.  Crustaceans, fish, and marine mammals are active

producers of sounds, which are picked up readily by sonar

equipment.</p><p>



</p><p>



	During and since World War II, a great deal of research on

sound-producing marine animals has been carried out.  The object

was to learn all the species of animals that produce sound, their

methods of production, and the physical characteristics of the

sounds (frequencies, intensities, etc.).  Sounds produced by many

species have been analyzed electronically, and considerable

physical data have been obtained.</p><p>



</p><p>



	All important sonic marine animals are members of one of three

groups crustaceans, fish, and mammals.</p><p>



</p><p>



	Crustaceans, particularly snapping shrimp, are one of the most

important groups of sonic marine animals.  Snapping shrimp, about

2 centimeters long, bear a general resemblance to the commercial

species, but are distinguishable from them by one long, large claw

with a hard movable finger at the end.  They produce sound by

snapping the finger against the end of the claw.  Distribution of

snapping shrimp appears to be governed by temperature, and they are

found near land in a worldwide belt lying between latitudes 35oN.

and 40oS.  In some places, such as along the coast of Europe, they

range as far north and south as 52o.  The largest colonies or beds

of snapping shrimp occur at depths of less than 30 fathoms on

bottoms of coral, rock, and shell.  There are exceptions, however.

They may, for example, occur as deep as 250 fathoms, and have been

found on mud and sand bottoms covered with vegetation.</p><p>



</p><p>



	A shrimp bed is capable of producing an uninterrupted crackle

resembling the sound of frying fat or burning underbrush. 

Frequencies range from less than 1 to 50 kHz.  Noise is constant,

but there is a diurnal cycle, with the maximum level at sunset. 

Over beds, a pressure level of 86 db re 1 Pa has been noted. 

Intensity drops off rapidly as the range from the bed increases.  Lobsters, crabs, and other crustaceans may make minor contributions

to background noise.</p><p>



</p><p>



	Fish produce a variety of sounds that may be placed in three

categories, depending upon how the sounds are caused.  The first

category includes sound produced by the air bladder, a membranous

sac of atmospheric gases lying in the abdomen.  The sound is caused

by the movement of muscles inside or outside the bladder or by the

general movement of the body.  The second division includes sounds

produced by various parts of the body such as fins, teeth, and the

like rubbing together.  This noise is called stridulatory sound. 

The third class includes sounds that are incidental to normal

activities, such as colliding with other fish or the bottom while

swimming, biting and chewing while feeding, and so on.</p><p>



</p><p>



	The majority of the sonic fish inhabit coastal waters, mostly

in temperate and tropical climates. Although fish are the most pre-valent, and therefore the most important, sound producers, their

activity is not as continuous in intensity as that of snapping

shrimp.  The level of sound produced by them increases daily when

they feed (usually at dawn and dusk), and annually when they breed. 

Fish sounds range in frequency from about 50 to 8000 Hz.  Sounds of

air bladder origin have most of their energy concentrated at the

lower end of this spectrum, 75 to 150 Hz, whereas stridulatory

sounds characteristically are concentrated at the higher end of the

spectrum.</p><p>



</p><p>



	Marine mammals, in addition to returning echoes from sonar

equipment, produce sound vocally and stridulously.  Seals, sea

lions, and similar animals posses vocal cords, and bark or whistle

or expel air through their mouths and nostrils to produce hisses

and snorts.  Whales, porpoises, and dolphins force air through

soft-walled nasal sacs, and the sounds produced in this way have

been described as echo-ranging pings, squeals, and long, drawn-out

moans similar to a foghorn blast.  Other sounds probably produced

by stridulation and attributed principally to whales, porpoises,

and dolphins are described as clicking and snapping.</p><p>

8.8.3  <b>Wenz Curve</b>.	</p><p>



</p><p>



While difficult to determine accurately on an operational basis,

ambient noise levels are nonetheless important factors to be

considered in determining sonar performance.  Figure 8-29is an

example of a set of Wenz curves that can be used to estimate noise

levels from a variety of sources within the frequency range of

interest.  Figure 8-30 is an expansion of the shipping noise/wind

noise portion of the Wenz curves.</p><p>

A SOSUS station is searching for an enemy submarine known to be

producing sound at a frequency of 300 Hz.  It is suspected that the

sub is patrolling in shipping lanes that currently have 6 ft. seas. 

Use Wenz curves to determine an approximate value of ambient noise.</p><p>



</p><p>



	From figure 8-30 the ambient noise level due to shipping at

300 Hz is 65 dB and that due to 6 ft seas is 66 dB.</p><p>



</p><p>



	Using the nomogram, figure 8-2 combine the signals of 65 dB

and 66 dB</p><p>

8.9  <b>THE SONAR EQUATIONS</b></p><p>



</p><p>



The key to success in antisubmarine warfare is initial detection. 

For this work the major sensor in use today is sonar, both active

and passive, and the present state of knowledge of the physical

world suggests no change in this situation for many years.  An

understanding of sonar can only be achieved through a comprehension

of the sonar equations and the concept called figure of merit. 

Many of the phenomena and effects associated with underwater sound

may conveniently and logically be related in a quantitative manner

by the sonar equations.  For many problems in ASW, the sonar equa-tions are the working relationships that tie together the effects

of the medium, the target, and the equipment, so that the operator

can effectively use and understand the information received and

provide prediction tools for additional information.  Therefore,

the purpose of this section is to spell out the sonar equations and

figure of merit, to state the specifics of their usefulness, and to

indicate how the various parameters in the sonar equations, in-cluding the figure of merit, can be measured.</p><p>



</p><p>



8.9.1  <b>Signal to Noise Ratio</b>.  </p><p>



</p><p>



The sonar equations are based on a relationship or ratio that must

exist between the desired and undesired portion of the received

energy when some function of the sonar set, such as detection or

classification, is performed.  These functions all involve the re-ception of acoustic energy occurring in a natural acoustic back-ground.  Of the total acoustic energy at the receiver, a portion is

from the target and is called signal.  The remainder is from the

environment and is called noise.  The oceans are filled with noise

sources, such as breaking waves, marine organisms, surf, and dis-tant shipping, which combine to produce what is known as ambient

noise.  Self-noise, in contrast, is produced by machinery within

the receiving platform and by motion of the receiving platform

through the water.  Further, in active systems, scatterers such as

fish, bubbles, and the sea surface and bottom produce an unwanted

return called reverberation, which contributes to the masking of

the desired signal.</p><p>



</p><p>



	The function of the design engineer is to optimize the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio for all conditions as detailed in the original

design specifications of the sonar set.  The operator, using his

knowledge of the design specifications, his known ability in

certain circumstances, the predicted conditions extrapolated from

previously determined measurements, and actual on-board

measurements, can then predict the detection probability.</p><p>



</p><p>



	In order to predict performance, the operator's interaction

with the sonar set must be defined or quantified in a manner that

provides a measure of predictability for varying signal and noise

levels.  This quantity, known as Detection Threshold (DT), attempts

to describe in a single number everything that happens once the

signal and its accompanying noise are received at the sonar. 

Detection threshold is defined as the signal minus noise level required inboard of the hydrophone array in order that an operator

can detect a target.  Actually, the business of detecting a sonar

signal is a chance process for several reasons, one of which is

that a human being is involved.  The decision to call a target may

be either right or wrong if a target is really present, then there

is a detection; if a target is not present, then there is a false

alarm.  Hence, the definition of DT is normally qualified by adding

the requirement that an operator "can detect a target on 50 percent

of those occasions for which a target presents itself."  Thus, if

the average value of provided signal-to-noise equals the average of

required signal-to-noise, a detection occurs in 50 percent of the

times that a detection could occur.  To summarize:</p><p>



</p><p>



			If average provided = average required, then

	detection probability is 50%</p><p>



			If average provided &gt; average required, then

	detection probability is 50% to 100%</p><p>



		   	If average provided &lt; average required, then

	detection probability is 50% to 0%</p><p>



</p><p>



Note that the instantaneous value of the provided or required

signal-to-noise can vary over a wide range due to the variability

of operators, and an individual operator's moods, as well as time

fluctuations in propagation loss, target radiated signal, and own

ship noise.  Hence, while the average value of provided signal-to-noise may be less than the average value of required signal-to-noise, at times the instantaneous value may be greater than the

required value, and a detection may occur.  Thus, a probability of

detection greater than zero exists.</p><p>



</p><p>



	Putting this all together, it can be seen that if detection is

to occur with a specified degree of probability, then the signal,

expressed in decibels, minus the noise, expressed in decibels, must

be equal to or greater than a number, the Detection Threshold,

which also is expressed in decibels.</p><p>



</p><p>



                              S - N <u>&gt;</u> DT               (8-25)</p><p>



</p><p>



	This equation is the foundation upon which all the versions of

the sonar equations are based, and is simply a specialized

statement of the law of conservation of energy.</p><p>



</p><p>

	Two pairs of the parameters are given the same symbol (Own

Sonar Source Level/Target Source Level, and Self-noise

is the symbolism the same in all publications, but they are the

ones conventionally used in technical literature.  It should be

noted as the discussion progresses how each of these parameters

will fit into the mold of the basic sonar equation.</p><p>

	The transmission loss is frequency dependent as shown in

Section 8.7.  When calculating the acoustic signal resulting from

a signal of interest superimposed on the ambient background noise

of the ocean (signal to noise ratio), this calculation must be made

using signals of the same frequency to be valid.  Since sonar

systems are designed to operate in specific frequency bands,

calculations for these systems must relate to the design frequency

band of the specific sonar to be valid.</p><p>



</p><p>



8.9.2  <b>Passive Sonar Equation</b></p><p>



</p><p>



A passive sonar depends on receiving a signal that is radiated by

a target.  The target signal can be caused by operating machinery,

propeller noise, hull flow noise, etc., but the same fundamental

signal-to-noise ratio requirement must be satisfied.  At the

receiver, the passive equation begins as S - N <u>&gt;</u> DT.  If the target

radiates an acoustic signal of SL (Target Source Level), the sound

intensity is diminished while en route to the receiver because of

any one or more of the following:  spreading, ray path bending,

absorption, reflection, and scattering.  The decrease in intensity

level due to this is called Transmission Loss (TL) and is also

measured in decibels.  Hence the intensity level of the signal

arriving at the ship is</p><p>



</p><p>



                          S = SL - TL                  (8-26)</p><p>



</p><p>



	Noise, N, acts to mask the signal and is not wanted. 

Therefore, the receiver is composed of many elements, sensitive

primarily in the direction of the target so that it can

discrimminate against noise coming from other directions.  This

discrimination against noise can be referred to as a spatial

processing gain and is called the Receiving Directivity Index, DI.  DI gives the reduction in noise level obtained by the directional

properties of the transducer array.  Therefore, in the basic

equation, noise is now reduced and becomes</p><p>



</p><p>



                          N = NL - DI                  (8-27)</p><p>



</p><p>



	There are two things to note in this simple equation:  the

first is that DI is always a positive quantity, so that NL - DI is

always less than or equal to NL; the second is that the parameter

NL represents both Self-noise Level and Ambient-noise Level, for by

its definition it is the noise at the hydrophone location and can

come from any, or all, sources.</p><p>

</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



	The passive sonar equation can now be constructed in terms of

signal and noise.  When S and N are substituted from equations (8-26) and (8-27) into (8-25) the result is</p><p>



</p><p>



                    SL - TL - NL + DI <u>&gt;</u> DT             (8-28)</p><p>



</p><p>



which is the simplest form of the passive sonar equation.  In

words, equation 8-28 says that the source level of the target minus

the loss due to propagation through the medium, minus the sum of

all interfering noises plus improvement by the spatial processing

gain of the receiver, must be equal to or greater than the

detection threshold for a target to be detected with the specified

probability of detection.  However, the greater-than or equal-to

condition is normally written as an equality.  It is then

understood to mean that if the left-hand side's algebraic sum is

greater than DT, detection is possible with a greater probability

than that specified by DT.  If the sum is less than DT, detection

probability decreases.  Generally speaking, these two conditions imply that either detection is highly probable or seldom occurs. 

As a further aid to understanding the passive sonar equation,

figure 8-31 illustrates the sonar parameters and indicates where </p><p>



each term involved interacts to produce the desired results.</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



8.9.3  <b>Active Sonar Equation</b></p><p>



</p><p>



In an active sonar, acoustic energy is transmitted, and the

received signal is the echo from the target.  Two different, but

related, equations are needed to describe the active sonar - one

for an ambient-noise-limited situation and the other for the

reverberation-limited situation.  As developed previously, sonar

performance is governed by the requirement that signal minus noise

must be equal to or greater than detection threshold.  The differ-ence in the two active sonar equations that satisfy this require-ment depends upon the characteristics of the noise that is actually

present at the receiver when the signal is detected.  The ambient

noise may be described as either isotropic-i.e., as much noise

power arrives from one direction as from any other - or as reverb-eration, in which noise returns primarily from the direction in

which the sonar has transmitted.</p><p>



</p><p>



	Before developing the active sonar equations, the two types of

noise should be briefly explained.  Ambient noise consists of those

noises present even when no sound is being radiated by a sonar. 

These include such noises as sea animals, machinery, propulsion

noises generated by the echo-ranging platform, and the turbulence

generated in the vicinity of the sonar.  This type is the same as

the noise level term discussed in the passive sonar equation.  The

second type, reverberation, consists of a multiplicity of echoes

returned from small scatterers located in the sound beam and near

the target when they reflect the transmitted energy.  The combined

effect of echoes from all of these scatterers produces a level of

noise at the receiver that will tend to mask the returning echo

from any wanted target.</p><p>



</p><p>



8.9.3.1  Noise-Limited.  The development of the active sonar

equation is similar to that for the passive equation.  In other

words, the formal sonar parameters will be fitted to the signal and

noise terms of equation (8-25).  If a sonar transmits an acoustic

pulse with an initial source level of SL dB, the transmitted pulse

will suffer a transmission loss in traveling to the target.  The

target will scatter acoustic energy, some of which will return to

the sonar.  The back-scattered intensity is called target strength

and is related to the scattering cross section of the target.  The

returning echo will again undergo a propagation loss, and thus the

signal at the sonar will be</p><p>



</p><p>



					S = SL - 2TL + TS             (8-29)</p><p>



</p><p>



As long as the source of the radiated energy and the receiver for

the echo are located together, the transmission loss experienced is

equal to twice the one-way transmission loss.</p><p>



</p><p>



	When the echo returns, under some conditions the reverberation

background due to the initial transmission will have disappeared,

and only ambient noise will be present.  This noise will be

identical to that described in the passive sonar equation, modified

by the receiving directivity index.  The fundamental relationship

can then be expressed as</p><p>



</p><p>



					SL - 2TL + TS - NL + DI <u>&gt;</u> DT  (8-30)</p><p>



</p><p>



which is the basic active sonar equation used when the sonar is

operating in a noise-limited situation.</p><p>



</p><p>



8.9.3.2  Reverberation-Limited.  If, on the other hand, the echo

returns when the reverberation background has not decayed to a

level below the ambient noise level, the background noise is given

by RL.  In this case, the parameter DI, defined in terms of an

isotropic background, is inappropriate, inasmuch as reverberation

is by no means isotropic.  For a reverberation background the terms

NL - DI are replaced by an equivalent reverberation level observed

at the hydrophone terminals, and the sonar equation takes the form.</p><p>



</p><p>



				SL - 2TL + TS - RL <u>&gt;</u> DT            (8-31)</p><p>



</p><p>



which is known as the reverberation-limited active sonar equation. 

Detailed quantification for the new term, RL, is difficult at best,

for it is a time-varying function resulting from the inhomogeneties

in the medium.  One thing to note is that in the normal conversion

from the basic equation to the active equations, the inequality

again becomes an equality.  As discussed under the passive sonar

equation, it is understood that when the terms on the left-hand

side exceed the detection threshold by a significant amount,

detection is highly probable, and when it is significantly less

than the detection threshold, detection seldom occurs.  Figure 8-31

pictorially depicts the active sonar equations.</p><p>



</p><p>



	Of special interest in the active sonar equations is the term

TS, and the fact that it usually is on the order of 15 to 25 dB. 

The variability of the value of TS is a function of the target

aspect presented to the incoming signal.  A beam target presents a

greater reflective area then the bow, hence more energy is

reflected from a beam target then from a bow target.  Because TS is

10 times the logarithm of the reflected intensity divided by the

inbound intensity, this statement apparently says that more energy

is reflected than is incident, a condition clearly not possible.  </p><p>



The key lies in the definition of terms:</p><p>



</p><p>



	I reflected is the intensity, I, of the reflected signal

measured one meter from the target, assuming the target is a point

source.</p><p>



	I inbound is the intensity, I, of the signal inbound from

transmitting ship to the target measured at a point on the target.</p><p>



	Intensity is actually power per unit area striking the target

at some point, and thus the total sound power striking the target

is I inbound times an effective area.  If one assumes that the major portion of this power is reflected not from the original

effective area (which is almost the same as the profile area of the

target), but instead from a point source, it necessarily follows

that the reflected energy computed in this way must be greater

because of the reduced area from which the energy emanates.  Thus

I reflected is greater than I inbound if both are defined as

indicated above.</p><p>



</p><p>



	In this case, there is no such wave as the one that is defined

as originating from the point source.  This construct is merely a

convenient way of duplicating the actual measured value of I re-flected when the wave is 1,000 meters or more away from the point

source enroute back to the transmitting ship.  Thus, if one were to

measure I reflected and I inbound both at 1,000 meters from the

target, then I inbound would definitely be greater than I reflect-ed.  Therefore, I reflected would have been computed to suffer a

greater attenuation in traveling 1,000 meters from the constructed

point source than I inbound will suffer in going 1,000 meters to

the target.  The explanation for this is the rapid attenuation due

to spreading from the point source as compared to that undergone by

the inbound wave, which is very near a plane wave when it is within

1,000 meters of the target.</p><p>

8.10  <b>FIGURE OF MERIT</b></p><p>



</p><p>



The possible detection range of particular equipment should be

known so that a tactician will then have a measure of the sonar's

capability and a feel for what the sonar can do in a given tactical

situation.  Unfortunately, with no change in basic sonar

configuration its detection capability measured in terms of range

can increase or decrease severalfold simply because the ocean

itself has changed.  To state this another way, sonar equipment can only be designed to detect the arrival of a certain sound energy

intensity.  The range from which that sound intensity arrives is

highly dependent on how much energy was lost en route, and

therefore detection range alone is a poor measure of sonar

capability.  A better measure is the ability of the sonar to detect

a certain level of sound energy intensity just outboard of its

receiver.  The key to this better measure of performance is to

separate the sonar from the ocean in which it must operate.  Only

then can sonar capability be discussed in terms of the unchanging

sonar hardware as distinguished from the ever-changing ocean.</p><p>



</p><p>



	The better measure for sonar capability is called figure of

merit (FOM), and it equals the maximum allowable one-way

transmission loss in passive sonars, or the maximum allowable two-way transmission loss in active sonars for a detection probability

of 50 percent.  Therefore, solving equations (8-28) and (8-30) for

transmission loss, we get</p><p>



</p><p>



		Passive FOM = SL - NL + DI - DT              (8-32)</p><p>



       	 Active FOM = SL + TS - NL + DI - DT         (8-33)</p><p>



</p><p>



This combination of terms is probably the most used performance

parameter for sonars, and it is important to understand just what

it means.  The FOM of a sonar system is the maximum transmission

loss that it can tolerate and still provide the necessary detection

probability as specified by DT.  FOM is improved by raising the

source level (this can be accomplished by increasing the

transmitted power in the active case or finding a noisier target in

the passive case), decreasing the ambient noise level, increasing

the absolute value of the receiving directivity index, and

decreasing the detection threshold.  The value of figure of merit

is that, with no knowledge of the intervening propagation path

between a ship and a target, a quantitative comparison of two

different sonars can be made.  The figure of merit may be utilized

for comparing the relative performance of two passive sonars

provided the calculations of the comparative figures of merit are

made for the same frequency.  The difference in FOM's represent

additional allowable propagation loss that can be sustained by the

sonar having the higher FOM and still make a detection; thus a

longer detection range results.  </p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



8.10.1  <b>Prop Loss Curves</b></p><p>



</p><p>



Naturally, to the tactician, detection ranges are of prime

importance, and although FOM can be interpreted in terms of range,

it can be done only if the propagation losses involved are known. 

The measure of propagation loss (total transmission loss) in many

parts of the ocean has proven that not only does sound propagation

change with frequency and location but with season as well.  Thus,

the sound velocity profile will determine the propagation path(s)

available, which along with frequency and location will determine

transmission loss versus range.  Therefore, in order to convert FOM

to range, one must have a propagation loss curve for the frequency or the sonar (s) concerned and for the area and season of the year

for which range prediction is desired.</p><p>



</p><p>



	Figure 8-33 is a typical propagation loss curve for the waters

off Iceland in the summer for a frequency of 2 Khz.  Note that the

propagation losses for the three sound paths previously described

are plotted.  Multiple bottom bounce losses were measured and mul-tiple convergence zones were estimated.</p><p>



</p><p>

</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



</p><p>



	Assume three different passive sonars with the following

values of FOM at 2 Khz:  80, 95, 105.  Based on Figure 8-32, the

range in Kyds at which 50% probability of detection is predicted

for each sonar for each sound transmission path in the Iceland area

is as follows:<u></u></p><p><u>



</u></p><p><u>



</u></p><p><u>



Sonar (FOM)      Direct        Bottom Bounce    Convergence Zone</u></p><p>



A      80         7.5            None               None</p><p>



B      95         21              50                 81</p><p>



C     105         36              90                160</p><p>



</p><p>



	Note that the sonar with the higher figure of merit permits

the use of sound paths (bottom bounce and convergence zone) not

available to the sonar with relatively low figure of merit.  The

higher the FOM the longer the detection range for a given path. 

Propagation loss curves can be made from a ray tracing program or

actual measurements and smoothed data.</p><p>



</p><p>



	In summary, sonar performance is the key to ASW success, and

figure of merit is the key to sonar performance.  With knowledge of

his sonar's FOM, a commanding officer can ensure that his equipment

is peaked, and also predict detection ranges against possible enemy

targets.  The war planner can do likewise for either a real or hypothetical enemy.  Because the changing ocean results in dramatic

changes in propagation loss versus range, to state a sonar's

capability in terms of range is only half the story, and may even

be misleading.  Using figure of merit, however, the sonar with the

higher FOM will always be the better sonar when comparing sonars in

the same mode.</p><p>



</p><p>



8.10.2  <b>Figure of Merit Sample Problem</b></p><p>



</p><p>



Your sonar is capable of either passive or active operation.  You

are operating in the shipping lanes with a sea state of 2.  Water

depth is 200 fathoms.  Using the following information, you must

decide which mode to use.  Intelligence information indicates that

the threat will be a Zebra-class submarine (all dB are reference

1Pa).</p><p>



</p><p>



	Target parameters:</p><p>

		radiated noise frequency			500 Hz</p><p>



		target strength				 15 dB</p><p>

</p><p>

	Directivity index		 10 dB		  8 dB</p><p>



	Detection threshold		 -2 dB		  3 dB</p><p>



</p><p>



	In order to determine which sonar to use, it is necessary to

calculate the FOM and total transmission loss for each mode.</p><p>



	</p><p>



	First, calculate the total transmission loss for each mode. 

Since the desired target detection range of 10 km is much greater

than the water depth of 200 fathoms, we will use equation (8-24)

for cylindrical spreading:</p><p>



     </p><p>



               TL = 10 log r +  r + A</p><p>



</p><p>



	The quantity A is assumed to be zero since no information is

available.  The absorption coefficient () is calculated by

substituting signal frequencies for each mode into equation (8-21):</p><p>



</p><p>



      = <u>  .036f2  </u> + 3.2 x 10-7 f2 (where f is in kilohertz)</p><p>



         f2 + 3600</p><p>



</p><p>



          <u>Active mode</u>                  <u>Passive mode</u></p><p>



</p><p>



 = <u>   .036(1.5)2  </u>                = <u>   .036(.5)2   </u> </p><p>



    (1.5)2 + 3600                        (.5)2 + 3600             

      + (3.2 x 10-7)(1.5)2                +(3.2 x 10-7)(.5)2</p><p>



</p><p>



      = 2.32 x 10-5              = 2.6 x 10-6</p><p>



    TL = 10 log(10,000) + 2.32  TL = 10 log(10,000) + 2.6 x</p><p>



         x 10-5(10,000)              10-6(10,000)</p><p>



    TL = 40 + .232              TL = 40 + .026</p><p>



    TL = 40.232 (one way)       TL = 40.026dB (Total TL)</p><p>



2 x TL = 80.464dB (Total TL)</p><p>



                           </p><p>



Note that TL depends only upon the detection range and the

frequency of the signal.</p><p>



</p><p>



	Next calculate the FOM using equation (8-33) for the active

mode and equation (8-32) for the passive case.  Note that the only

values that must be determined are the noise levels using the Wenz

curves and nomograms for the different frequencies.</p><p>



</p><p>



         <u>Active Mode</u>                         <u>Passive Mode</u></p><p>



</p><p>



         f = 1500 Hz                           f = 500 Hz</p><p>



</p><p>



AN(shipping) = negligible          AN(shipping) = 57dB</p><p>



AN(sea state) = 58dB               AN(sea state) = 61dB</p><p>



Self-Noise = 50dB                  Self-Noise = 50dB</p><p>



</p><p>



	Using the nomogram, combine the signals for each mode:</p><p>



</p><p>



58-50 = 8dB                        61 - 57 = 4 dB</p><p>



NL = 58 + .65 (from nomogram)      AN = 61 + 1.5 (from nomogram)</p><p>



NL = 58.65 dB                      AN = 62.5 dB</p><p>



                                   62.5 - 50 = 12.5 dB</p><p>



                                   NL = 62.5 + .25 = 62.75 dB</p><p>



</p><p>



	Note that when three noise signals are involved, a two-step

signal-combining process is required.  The resultant is always

added to the higher signal level.  Determining the FOM is now a

simple matter of substituting the calculated and given values into

the appropriate equations:</p><p>



       <u>Active Mode</u>                       <u>Passive Mode</u></p><p>



</p><p>



FOM = SL + TS - NL + DI          FOM = SL - NL + DI - DT</p><p>



       - DT                      FOM = 100 - 62.75 + 8 - 3</p><p>



FOM = 110 + 15 - 58.65 +         FOM = 42.25 dB</p><p>



      10 -(-2)</p><p>



FOM = 78.35 dB</p><p>



	</p><p>



	Compare the FOM of each mode with the total TL for each mode

to determine which mode is optimum for this target.  The FOM for

the active case is less than the total TL.  Therefore, the active

mode will give your ship less than 50% probability of detection. 

The FOM for the passive case is greater than the total TL. 

Therefore, the passive mode will give a greater than 50%

probability of detection, which means that the passive mode should

be used.</p><p>

8.11  <b>SUMMARY</b></p><p>



</p><p>



Of all the energy forms available, sound, even with its inherent

disadvantages, is the most useful for underwater detection of

submarines.  It travels as a series of compressions and

rarefactions at a speed equal to the product of its frequency and

wavelength.  The pressure of the wave can be expressed as a

function of both time and its distance from the source.  Acoustic

power, called its intensity, is a measure of the amount of energy

per unit area and has the units watts/m2.  Acoustic pressure is

expressed in micro-pascals.  To make comparisons easier, both are

normally converted to the logarithmic decibel system.  The speed of

sound in the sea is related to the bulk modulus and density of the

water, which are affected by the temperature, pressure, and
salinity.  Temperature is the most important of these environmental

factors, and therefore the thermal structure of the ocean is of

significant tactical importance.  The tracing out of sound paths in

water is known as ray theory and is governed by Snell's Law. 

Various unique propagation paths can be identified according to the

thermal structure of the water, but in practice such paths are a

complex combination of simpler structures.  Actual sound

propagation through the sea is subject to geometric spreading and

attenuation, both of which decrease the acoustic intensity at the

receiver.  The active and passive sonar equations are an expression

of various factors determined by the equipment, the medium, and the

target, which lead to an overall measure of sonar performance

called figure of merit.</p><p>
