According to Einstein's theory of relativity, the energy of an object equals the 
    sum of its kinetic energy and its rest mass energy. Rest mass energy is the 
    energy that corresponds to the mass of the object when it is at rest. This 
    is a basic property inherent in matter. Its value is <img src="./neutrino_e_files/Image146.gif" width="58" height="21" align="ABSMIDDLE">, 
    where <i>m</i> is the rest mass of the object and <i>c</i> is the speed of 
    light in vacuum. This is the famous Einstein's mass-energy equivalence relation, 
    which is the theoretical foundation of nuclear applications. Among all of 
    the known elementary particles, most of them have different values of rest 
    mass. Particles with zero rest mass are rare. The well-known photon is one 
    of them. For a long period, physical theories supposed that neutrino had zero 
    rest mass. However, the Super-Kamiokande detector (a neutrino observatory) 
    in Japan recently discovered that neutrino has nonzero rest mass. This discovery 
    immediately became a hot topic in the field of physics and also in astronomy. 
    Why does the rest mass of neutrino have so great influence in physics and 
    astronomy? <br>
    <br>

<h3>What is neutrino?</h3>
In 1930, W. Pauli postulated the existence of neutrino, aiming at explaining the 
    continuous property of the kinetic energy spectrum of the beta particles during 
    the beta decay. He believed that apart from the electron released in beta 
    decay, an electrically neutral particle should also have been released. In 
    1934, E. Fermi established the beta decay theory and named this particle the 
    neutrino. Particle physicists nowadays believe that there are three different 
    kinds of neutrino in nature. They are related to the three members of the 
    lepton family respectively. They are electron-neutrino <img src="./neutrino_e_files/Image150.gif" align="ABSMIDDLE">, 
    <img src="./neutrino_e_files/Image151.gif" align="ABSMIDDLE"> neutrino <img src="./neutrino_e_files/Image152.gif" align="ABSMIDDLE"> 
    and <img src="./neutrino_e_files/Image153.gif" align="ABSMIDDLE"> neutrino <img src="./neutrino_e_files/Image154.gif" align="ABSMIDDLE">. 
    In other words, there are three different states (or flavours) of neutrino. 
    Same as other particles, there exist antiparticles of the neutrinos, named 
    as the antineutrinos. According to the standard model in particle physics, 
    neutrino has zero rest mass and is a spin-half particle. Neutrino only involves 
    in weak interactions. Its presence in a particle reaction has become an indicator 
    of the existence of weak interaction. Theoretically, the existence of neutrino 
    is confirmed, but its interaction with ordinary matter is very weak and it 
    can pass through the earth almost without any obstacles. This makes the detection 
    of it very difficult. As its existence and the value of its rest mass mean 
    a lot to cosmology and physics, it is highly valued by scientists. It has 
    also been considered as an important problem to be solved in physics in the 
    late twentieth century. 
    <h3>The physical meaning of the rest mass of neutrino</h3>
In the late 60's, physicists successfully unified the electromagnetic interaction 
    and the weak interaction into the Electroweak Theory and received the Nobel 
    Prize in physics afterward. The theory had predicted the mass of neutrino 
    to be zero. Later, physicists tried to unify all the four fundamental interactions 
    in nature and proposed the Grand Unified Theory. This theory predicted the 
    proton decay and that neutrino has a nonzero rest mass. As the half-life of 
    proton decay lasts 1031 years and the interaction between neutrino and other 
    particles is very weak, it is very difficult to verify these two predictions. 
    At present, people have yet found a strong evidence for proton decay. However, 
    there is no doubt the discovery of the rest mass of neutrino is a milestone 
    for the establishment of the Grand Unified Theory. Because the present standard 
    model of particle physics is extremely rigorous and most of its predictions 
    are already verified by experiments, the confirmation of the rest mass of 
    neutrino has forced the physicists to modify the old standard model in particle 
    physics. We have reasons to believe that the present standard model is only 
    a better approximation of a more rigorous theory. In the near future, many 
    new particles may be discovered, new ideas in physics and new theories will 
    appear. <br>
    <br>

<h3>The cosmological meaning of the rest mass of neutrino</h3>
The generally accepted cosmological model today is the big bang model. This theory 
    considers that the universe was born in one big bang and it keeps expanding 
    since then. However, one prediction of the Big Bang Theory has a great deviation 
    from real astronomical observations. From the astronomical observations, scientists 
    have found out that the abundance of cosmic matter is far less than the predicted 
    value of the Big Bang Theory. If the Big Bang Theory is correct, this indicates 
    that there is still a large amount of undiscovered dark matters existing in 
    the universe. These dark matters must be very stable or with very long life 
    spans. Also, they do not involve in electromagnetic interactions. Therefore 
    it is impossible for them to send out electromagnetic signals to indicate 
    their existence. From all the elementary particles known, neutrino is the 
    only possible candidate for dark matter. Latest researches have shown that 
    as long as the total mass of the three kinds of neutrino reaches tens of electron-volts, 
    the recent astronomical observations can be theoretically explained very well. 
    <br>

<h3>The disappearance of solar neutrino and neutrino oscillation</h3>
During the nuclear reactions in the inner sun, there is a large amount of neutrinos 
    produced at every moment. But for many years, the result of the solar neutrino 
    observation has pointed out that the flux of neutrino from solar nuclear reactions 
    has only reached 1/3 to 1/2 of the theoretical prediction. This is called 
    the solar-neutrino problem. To explain this phenomenon, physicists have deduced 
    that if the rest mass of neutrino is nonzero, according to quantum mechanics, 
    during the transmission of neutrino from the sun to the earth, neutrino would 
    interchange among its three flavours. This is called the neutrino oscillation. 
    As the old observational instruments can only detect the electron-neutrino, 
    the disappearance problem above arises. The nonzero rest mass of neutrino 
    has given a clear answer to this problem. <br>
    <br>

<h3>An unfinished story</h3>
Although the fact that neutrino has nonzero rest mass has already been proved 
    experimentally, there are still a lot of problems remained. For example, for 
    the time being, only the mass difference between electron-neutrino and muon-neutrino 
    is given. The absolute mass of neutrino is still unconfirmed. Also, the third 
    kind of neutrino, the tau-neutrino, has not been discovered yet. Are there 
    still other flavours of neutrino existing in nature? What is the mass of each 
    kind of neutrino? Experiments cannot give a clear answer yet. The fact that 
    neutrino has nonzero rest mass has solved many fundamental problems in contemporary 
    physics and cosmology and at the same time puts forth a great challenge to 
    particle physics. We can foresee that the picture of the formation and the 
    evolution of the universe will alter a lot in the future. Since the rest mass 
    of neutrino has not been determined, we still cannot know all about the history 
    and the fate of the universe. </div>
