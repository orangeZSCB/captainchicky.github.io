Sonar Propagation

</p><p>

<img src="./Sonar Propagation_files/IMG00001.GIF"><br>

<br>

<br>

        By virtue of the fact that the speed that acoustic waves

travel at depends on the properties of the medium (i.e. sea water),

the propagation of sonar will be complicated.  So complicated

in fact that it will be impossible to accurately predict without

the use of a computer model. However, sonar systems rely heavily

on operator input and control to maximize their performance. 

Many of the decisions made regarding the maneuvering of the ship

carrying the sonar system will also affect the sonar's performance.

 Therefore a detailed knowledge of the salient features of sonar

propagation is essential to its successful employment. We begin

with a simple model for the transmission loss.<br>

</p><p>

Transmission Loss Formula

</p><p>

        Transmission loss (TL) can be predicted, to a very rough

degree, solely on the basis of a few factors.  These factors are

range, and frequency.  <br>

</p><p>

Range Effect

</p><p>

        The simplest case, which is the identical case used in

electro-optics and radar, is to assume all of the acoustic energy

is uniformly distributed in all directions.  In sonar this is

termed <i>spherical spreading loss</i>, since the intensity will

fall off proportional to the surface area of a sphere.<br>

</p><p>

<img src="./Sonar Propagation_files/IMG00002.GIF"><tt>Figure 1.  Spherical spreading.<br>

<br>

</tt>        

</p><p>

Since the area over which the energy is distributed at range,

R,  is 4<font face="Symbol">p</font>R<sup>2</sup>, the ratio of

any two intensity levels at different ranges can be computed.

 If we take the decibel equivalent, and take the first range as

one meter, which happens to be where the source level is defined,

we obtain the spherical spreading loss f part of TL:<br>

<br>

TL<sub>spherical</sub> = -10 Log { I(R)/I(1 m)} = -10 Log{1/R<sup>2</sup>}

<br>

<br>

TL<sub>spherical</sub> = 20 Log(R) .<br>

<br>

The negative sign was included since TL is defined to be positive

quantity, and is subtracted in the SNR equations.  <br>

<br>

        When the acoustic energy reaches either the surface or

the bottom of the ocean, it is generally reflected back.  A long

range, all of the acoustic energy will tend to confined between

two planes, one at the surface and the other at the bottom.  Therefore,

the energy can no longer spread out like the spherical spreading

case, but now becomes <i>cylindrical spreading</i>.<br>

<img src="./Sonar Propagation_files/IMG00003.GIF">

</p><p>

Figure 2. Cylindrical spreading.<br>

<br>

        

</p><p>

The area over which the energy is distributed now varies directly

with range, R.  The common factors will cancel, and the transmission

loss between two ranges will be 10 Log( R).  Explicitly this means

<br>

<br>

SPL(R<sub>2</sub>) = SPL(R<sub>1</sub>) - 10 Log(R<sub>2</sub>/R<sub>1</sub>).

<br>

<br>

It would be nice if we could choose R<sub>1</sub> to be one meter

in which case SPL(R<sub>1</sub>) = SL, but this would be incorrect.

 That would be akin to claiming that the spreading losses where

cylindrical starting from one meter.  Clearly, in regions where

the water depth is larger than the range, the spreading must be

spherical.  <br>

<br>

        The question now becomes:  at what range does the spreading

loss transition between the spherical and cylindrical case.  

If the source where located exactly in the middle (halfway between

the surface and bottom), then it seems plausible to make the transition

when the range is one-half the water depth since this is when

the surface of the sphere will just touch the bottom and top.

 The transition range will depend on the location of the source

and the depth of water.  For purposes we assume the transition

range to be 1000 m, since the average ocean depth is about 2000

m.  <br>

<br>

        At 1000 m, the  transmission loss  due solely to spherical

spreading will be 60 dB.  Taking this as the starting point for

cylindrical spreading, we can patch the two equations together

by adding 30 dB to the 10 Log(R) spreading.  This is proven below:

<br>

<br>

TL<sub>spherical</sub>(at 1000 m) = 20 Log (1000) = 60 dB<br>

<br>

TL<sub>cylindrical</sub>(at 1000m) = 10 Log(1000) = 30 dB<br>

<br>

If we wish to apply the TL<sub>cylindrical </sub>formula starting

at 1 m, then we must add the difference at 1000m, therefore<br>

<br>

TL<sub>cylindrical</sub> (R) = 10 Log(R) + 30 dB.  (valid when

R &gt; 1000 m)<br>

<br>

        At ranges of less than 1000 m, you must use the spreading

spreading loss formula, TL<sub>spherical </sub> = 20 Log(R).<br>

</p><p>

absorption/scattering

</p><p>

        Like air in electro-optics, the intervening water between

the source and receiver will either absorb some of the acoustic

energy passing through it.  The dependence on range will be identical

to Bougher's law, but now in decibel form:<br>

<br>

Tl<sub>abs </sub>= - 10 Log( e<sup>-<font face="Symbol">b</font>R</sup>)

= (10 <font face="Symbol">b</font>)R<br>

<br>

where <font face="Symbol">b</font> is the extinction coefficient.

 The factor of 10 and a unit conversion into km is absorbed in

the definition of  the absorption coefficient, <font face="Symbol">a</font>

 <font face="Symbol">b</font>/100, therefore<br>

<br>

Tl<sub>abs</sub> = <font face="Symbol">a</font> R.<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

where <font face="Symbol">a</font> has units of dB/km.  The absorption

coefficient has a strong frequency dependence, meaning much greater

losses at higher frequency.  The absorption coefficient can be

calculated from a formula:<br>

<img src="./Sonar Propagation_files/IMG00004.GIF"><br>

<br>

 <br>

<br>

where f is in kHz, and the result for a is in dB/km.<br>

<br>

or using a graph:<br>

<br>

<img src="./Sonar Propagation_files/IMG00005.GIF">Figure 3.  Absorption coefficient<br>

as a function of frequency.<br>

        <br>

</p><p>

Other losses

</p><p>

        Many other things can happen to the acoustic wave as it

propagates.  For example the energy may scatter off particles

or biologics.  Energy will be lost upon reflection from the surface

and bottom.  And lastly, by but far the greatest factor of all

will be the change in the propagation due to the variations in

the speed with temperature, depth and salinity.  The change in

speed will tend to distort the perfect spherical or cylindrical

shape of the wave front.  This does not, however, always result

in greater transmission losses.  As we shall soon see, there are

many conditions which tend to concentrate acoustic energy resulting

in a lower than expected transmission loss. <br>

<br>

        All of these factors just discussed can be lumped into

a single term, A, called the <i>transmission loss anomaly</i>.

 This is surely artificial and is only used in order to be able

to write a complete equation for TL.  All deviations from the

predicted result can be explained away in the term A.  The equation

so written is<br>

<br>

<br>

</p><p>

TL = 10 Log(R) + 30 + <font face="Symbol">a</font>R + A<br>

<br>

<br>

</p><p>

        If you ignore, the last two terms, the range dependence

is very straight forward, and can be used to generate some rules

of thumb:<br>

<br>

<br>

</p><p>

TL  60 dB at 1 km<br>

<br>

<br>

</p><p>

TL  70 dB at 10 km<br>

<br>

<br>

</p><p>

TL  80 dB at 100 km.<br>

<br>

<br>

</p><p>

This is based on nothing but the spherical and cylindrical spreading

losses, assuming the source is exactly in the middle of 2000 m

deep water.  What one finds in practice, are variations about

these baseline numbers.  This can also be shown in graphical form,

TL vs. range.  <br>

Propagation Paths

</p><p>

        To gain further insight into how the environment can affect

propagation, we first study how the propagation speed varies in

the ocean. <br>

</p><p>

The Sound Velocity Profile (SVP)

</p><p>

        The largest variation is the speed of sound in water occurs

with changes is depth.  Obviously the pressure increases with

depth causing a uniform increase of +1.7 m/s for every 100 m.

 Furthermore, the ambient temperature changes with depth.   A

plot of propagation speed (velocity) as a function of depth, is

called the <i>sound velocity profile</i> (SVP), and it is the

fundamental tool for predicting how sound will travel.  Neglecting

salinity, the SVP can be obtained from sampling the ambient temperature

at various depths (the pressure contribution never varies).  An

inexpensive probe to do this is called an expendable bathythermograph

(XBT).  The resulting SVP looks like this:<br>

<img src="./Sonar Propagation_files/IMG00007.GIF">

</p><p>

Figure 5.  Oean layers.<br>

 <br>

<br>

</p><p>

The SVP reveals some common structure to the ocean.  The water

can be divided into three vertical regions.  <br>

<br>

The surface (seasonal) layer is at the top and is the most variable

part.  As the name suggests, the profile will changes depending

on the time of day (diurnal variation) and the season (seasonal

variation).  During the day, the heat from the sun (insolation)

causes the water at the very top to be warmer than the water below.

 Since the condition of warm over cold is stable, the condition

is quite common.  Late in the afternoon, particularly on a bright

day, the surface temperture will be the greatest and so one would

expect the greatest gradient (change with depth).<br>

</p><p>

<img src="./Sonar Propagation_files/IMG00008.GIF">Figure 6.  Diurnal variation in<br>

SVP.<br>

<br>

</p><p>

The main thermocline connects the seasonal layer with the uniformly

cold water found deep in the ocean.  Below about 500 m, all of

the world's oceans are at about 34<sup>o</sup> F.  The positive

gradient in the deep isothermal region is solely due to the pressure

effect.  <br>

<br>

        In the summer, the seasonal layer tends to have a strongly

negative gradient, for the same reason as given to explain the

diurnal variation.  So the summer profile looks like:<br>

<img src="./Sonar Propagation_files/IMG00009.GIF">

</p><p>

Figure 7.  Summer SVP.<br>

<br>

        

</p><p>

In winter, the water is generally warmer than the air.  A lot

of heat is lost through advection and radiation.  However, one

would not expect to see cold water setting on top of warm water

for very long.  Convection brings the warm water to the surface

destroying the effect.  The surface layer tends to be closer to

isothermal than anything else. Additionally, strong winter storms

and their large waves frequently mix the surface layer to a depth

of up to 100 m.  For the nearly isothermal surface layer, one

could expect a weakly positive gradient above the main thermocline.

 <br>

</p><p>

Ray Tracing

</p><p>

        The change of propagation speed with depth will manifest

itself through refraction of the sound.  A graphical method of

illustrating the effects is called ray tracing.  The basic idea

is to draw lines perpendicular to the wave fronts and follow their

paths.  For a typical sonar array, these lines start equally spaced

within the beam capability of the array (discussed in the next

chapter).<br>

<img src="./Sonar Propagation_files/IMG00011.GIF">

</p><p>

Figure 9.  Ray tracing.<br>

<br>

        

</p><p>

As the rays go deeper, they begin to refract.  Recall how differences

in the index of refraction (which are a measure of the propagation

speed) affected electromagnetic waves.  As the rays move into

a medium which has a slower propagation speed, they tend to become

more vertical.  On the whole, the rays will deflect downward in

a negative gradient.<br>

<img src="./Sonar Propagation_files/IMG00012.GIF">

</p><p>

Figure 10.  Negative SVP<br>

gradient.<br>

<br>

<br>

        

</p><p>

As you might expect, the opposite effect occurs when the gradient

is positive.  As the rays enter deeper water the propagation speed

increases and the rays bend upwards.<br>

<br>

<img src="./Sonar Propagation_files/IMG00013.GIF">Figure 11.  Positive SVP gradient.<br>

        <br>

        <br>

All of the rays will be deflected upwards.  When the rays reach

the surface, the will be reflected back downwards and the same

process begins again.  Naturally, some of the energy is lost and

the reflection, but the overall effect is to trap the sound in

a relatively small layer below the surface.  The sound does not

reach the deeper regions, so the transmission less than you would

expect for cylindrical spreading.  This effect is called a <i>surface

duct</i>.<br>

<img src="./Sonar Propagation_files/IMG00014.GIF">

</p><p>

Figure 12.  Surface duct.<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

        

</p><p>

The other common propagation modes occur during combinations of

positive and negative gradients.  A positive gradient over a negative

gradient produces a special kind of propagation, where the rays

split at the boundary which is called the <i>layer</i>.  The depth

of maximum sound velocity which ocurs on the layer is called the

<i>layer depth </i>(LD).<i>  <br>

<br>

<img src="./Sonar Propagation_files/IMG00015.GIF"></i>

</p><p>

<br>

</p><p>

<img src="./Sonar Propagation_files/IMG00017.GIF"><br>

<br>

<br>

</p><p>

        Above the layer, the positive gradient will produce a

surface duct as previously described.  When rays penetrate below

the layer, they are deflected downward.  Therefore, the rays diverge

above and below the layer. Beyond a certain minimum range, the

rays from the source will never reach locations just below the

layer.  This is called <i>the shadow zone.  </i>It is a favored

depth for submarines to operate at for just this very reason.

 The optimum depth to operate at, called best depth (BD), is a

function of the layer depth.  The best depth can be calculated

from <br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

For the case where the negative gradient is over the positive,

rays which originate at the boundary will be deflected back towards

the middle, regardless if they go up or down.  This forms a <i>sound

channel</i>, where the rays are then confined to the small region

above and below the axis, called the <i>sound channel axis</i>.

<br>

<br>

<img src="./Sonar Propagation_files/IMG00018.GIF">

</p><p>

Figure 14.  Sound channel.<br>

<br>

</p><p>

The sound channel will not work for rays that begin at the surface,

like in the other cases.  The source must be located near the

axis.  Several sonar systems have features which allow them to

be placed near the sound channel axis.  For example, sonobouys,

which are small self-contained sonar  systems, have a setting

which places them at a typical sound channel axis depth.<br>

<br>

<br>

        Another special type of propagation occurs when the water

is so deep that no sound can reach the bottom without being deflected

upwards by the normal positive gradient found in the deep isothermal

layer.  This situation requires a minimum of 200 m of <i>depth

excess </i>which is defined as<br>

<br>

depth excess:  the distance from the lower boundary of the sound

channel to the bottom.<br>

<br>

When all of the sound rays are returned to near the surface, they

tend to converge into a small region.  Therefore the sound pressure

level is increased dramatically in this region known as a <i>convergence

zones </i>(CZ). <br>

<img src="./Sonar Propagation_files/IMG00019.GIF">

</p><p>

Figure 15.  Convergence<br>

zone.<br>

<br>

</p><p>

The convergence zone tends to be at large distances, typically

20-30 nm from the source.  It is possible to have multiple convergence

zones, which will occur at regular intervals.  For example, if

the first CZ is at 30 nm, the second CZ would be at 60 nm.  The

CZ is only a few miles wide, and therefore, contacts which are

acquired through convergence zones tend to appear and disappear

quickly.  <br>

<br>

        It may be possible for a ship to have a rather limited

sonar range due to regular transmission losses but multiple convergence

zones.  These zones form protective rings about the ship.  A hostile

submarine closing in on the ship would be detected as it passes

through the various convergence zones, thereby alerting the ship

to its presence.  The ship could then deploy mobile ASW assets

like a helicopter to handle the submarine.<br>

<br>

</p><p>

<br>

<br>

<br>

        

</p><p>

Finally the last type of propagation occurs in when the sound

is strongly reflected from the ocean floor.  The rays tends to

converge near the surface, resulting in a reduced transmission

loss.  This is called <i>bottom bounce</i> propagation.  Rays

from bottom bounce can be identified from the others because of

the larger angle of incidence.  Typical bottom bound comes into

the sonar at angles of more than 30<sup>o</sup> from horizontal.

 <br>

<img src="./Sonar Propagation_files/IMG00021.GIF">

</p><p>

Figure 17.  Bottom bounce.<br>

                <br>

</p><p>

Only certain ocean floor conditions are conducive to bottom bounce

propagation.  Flat and hard ocean floors tend to be the best.

 Soft mud, on the other hand is the worst. <br>

<br>

                <br>

</p><p>

Figure of Merit

</p><p>

        Because the propagation of acoustics waves in the ocean

is fairly complicated, the use of a formula for transmission loss

is of limited accuracy.  Computer models can be used to produce

much more accurate plots of TL as a function of range, known as

transmission loss curves.  Here is a typical TL curve showing

some of the features just discussed:<br>

<img src="./Sonar Propagation_files/IMG00022.GIF">

</p><p>

Figure 18.  Typical TL<br>

curve.<br>

<br>

</p><p>

In comparision to the geometrical TL (spherical and cylindrical

spreading losses) you will note there are certain ranges where

the TL actually goes down with increased range.  These are locations

where the refraction effects of the ocean cause the sound rays

to concentrate.  This example illustrates the effect of bottom

bound and CZ.  <br>

<br>

        Given an accurate transmission loss curve, we are now

in a position to estimate the maximum detection range of a sonar

system.  Recall that detection is possible whenever<br>

<br>

SNR &lt; DT.<br>

<br>

        To solve for range, we only need rearrange terms to isolate

the range dependence.  For the passive case, define figure of

merit, FOM<br>

<br>

<br>

</p><p>

FOM<sub>passive</sub>  SL + DI - NL - DT<br>

<br>

<br>

</p><p>

Now the detection criterion becomes<br>

<br>

FOM &gt; TL.  <br>

<br>

Which leads to the following interpretation:<br>

<br>

Figure of Merit (FOM) is the maximum transmission loss the system

can have and still be able to detect the target (at 50% of the

time).  <br>

<br>

        If FOM is known, then the maximum range can be determined

by plotting the FOM as a horizontal line on the TL curve.  All

ranges where the FOM &gt; TL (remember that TL is increasing in

the down direction), are detectable.  <br>

<img src="./Sonar Propagation_files/IMG00023.GIF">

</p><p>

Figure 19.  Determining<br>

maximum detection range from FOM.<br>

<br>

</p><p>

In this example, the FOM = 75 dB.  From the graph, it is apparent

that FOM &gt; TL everywhere less than 18 km, which is the maximum

detection range.  <br>

<br>

<br>

</p><p>

FOM<sub>active</sub>  SL + TS + DI - NL - DT<br>

<br>

<br>

</p><p>

        For active systems, there are (at least) two complications.

 First the FOM is modified so that <br>

<br>

Secondly, the transmission loss is incurred twice, as the sound

travels to the target and back.  You could use a separate curve

with twice the TL vs. range, or alternatively, use one-half the

FOM, which is the preferred method.  So for active systems, the

detection criterion is:<br>

<br>

<br>

FOM &gt; 2 TL or FOM/2 &gt; TL.<br>

<br>

Therefore, you calculate FOM and then plot FOM/2 on the TL curve

to obtain range in the same manner.  <br>
