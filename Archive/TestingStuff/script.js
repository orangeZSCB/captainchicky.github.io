It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. A subdomain is a domain that is part of a larger domain. Each label may contain from 1 to 63 octets. The full domain name may not exceed a total length of 253 ASCII characters in its textual representation. Most domain registries only allocate a two-level domain name. Hosting services typically provide DNS Servers to resolve subdomains within that master domain. DNS uses a hierarchy to manage its distributed database system. The DNS hierarchy, also called the domain name space, is an inverted tree structure, much like eDirectory. The DNS tree has a single domain at the top of the structure called the root domain. A period or dot (.) is the designation for the root domain. Below the root domain are the top-level domains that divide the DNS hierarchy into segments. For the video, click on the image. Watch the video from 4:10 to the end. ",

A computer network is a group of computers that use a set of common communication protocols over digital interconnections for the purpose of sharing resources located on or provided by the network nodes. The interconnections between nodes are formed from a broad spectrum of telecommunication network technologies, based on physically wired, optical, and wireless radio-frequency methods that may be arranged in a variety of network topologies. Computing devices are the electronic devices which take inputs, process the inputs and then calculate results from the inputs. Or in simple words, these are basically the mathematical devices which can do the math much in faster way. One of the most common computing devices are computers.",
