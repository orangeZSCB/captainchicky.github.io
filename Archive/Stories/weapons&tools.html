Sci-fi weapons and tools list.
==============================
**Electromagnetic**:
*Lasers* - concentrated beam of photons at different energy levels, ranging from radio to gamma.
*Ion propulsion-based weapons* - the propulsion of highly energetic particles, usually in a beam.
*Chemical detonations* - an uncontrolled or controlled release of energy created via chemical reactions.
*EMPs* - a pulse of electromagnetic radiation, usually in a beam or shockwave used to short-wire electronics.
*Railguns* - a weapon that uses magnetic fields to accelerate objects to a high speed to incapacitate an entity.
*Extremely strong magnetic fields* - a magnetic field around a trillion tesla, used to redirect particles capable of interacting with it.
*Grey goo* - nanomachines programmed to make more copies of itself with surrounding resources indefinitely, similar to a fork bomb.

**Strong and weak interaction**:
*Fusion and fission based nuclear bombs* - a controlled or uncontrolled release of energy created by the fusion or fission of atomic nuclei.
*Strangelets* - a positively charged droplet of up, down, and strange quarks in roughly equal ratios, capable of converting normal matter into strange matter.

**Gravity**:
*Induced black hole* - sudden compression of a particle or group of particles such that escape velocity from the region in which it is concentrated exceeds the speed of light. If the resulting black hole has charge, it can be propelled via magnetic fields.

**Large-scale destruction**:
*Black hole bomb* - through the use of the Penrose process, superradiant scattering, and a large structure of encompassing mirrors, one can harvest and hold energy from a spinning black hole's ergosphere and concentrate it into an uncontrolled explosion.

**Biological weapons**:
*Chemical agents* - a molecule that is able to impair the function of another biological entity.
*Biological agents* - a biological entity(for example, a virus or bacterium) that is able to harm or destroy other biological entities.
*Propulsion weapons* - a weapon that uses a variety of methods such as chemical or air pressure to accelerate an object to incapacitate an entity.

**waiting for explanation lol**:
*Time related weapons* - a weapon that can somehow manipulate or change time passage in a region of spacetime.
*Dimensional collapse weapons* - a weapon that can collapse the dimension of spacetime into a lower one, typically occurring at the speed of light. A civilization may be able to survive via computer emulation of higher dimensions. The Rule 110 cellular automaton is Turing complete, which means that given enough time and space it can do anything that a normal computer can do. By using such thing, higher dimensions can be simulated.
*Black domain* - a region of spacetime where the speed of light, and thus the maximum speed of a massive accelerating object is lowered to hamper travel.
*Disabling electric bonds* - the ability to disable the electromagnetic field in a given region of spacetime, resulting in the dissolution of molecules.
*Disabling gluons* - the ability to disable the strong nuclear field in a given region of spacetime resulting in the dissolution of atoms due to the resulting unconfined quarks.
*Causing every radioactive nuclei within a vicinity to decay* - the manipulation of the weak and strong nuclear force and occasionally the electromagnetic force to induce decay of all unstable nuclei within causing massive energy release.
*Neutron-pasta based explosive* - the ability to transport neutron pasta to an area and then cause it to rapidly expand into normal density, creating an explosion.
*Graviton manipulation induced attraction* - the ability to manipulate spacetime and the subsequent gravitational field to induce greater attraction of an object to a specific area.
*Artificially induced supernova* - by either removing fusion from a star's core, or by creating enough radiation pressure that gravity cannot hold a star together, one of the most violent explosions in the universe can be induced.
*Vacuum decay* - assuming the Higgs Field is metastable, through a trigger such as a very energetic explosion or induced quantum tunneling the Higgs Field can decay into a more stable version of itself expanding in a sphere through spacetime at the speed of light, where inside the more stable Higgs Field, physics may be completely different than usual.
*Wormholes* - by finding negative mass matter, one can prop open wormholes(which will collapse into singularities if left un-sustained) and travel great distances.
*The Alcubierre drive* - a method in which a massive object could achieve apparent faster-than-light travel if a configurable energy-density field lower than that of the vacuum could be created. In other words a massive object would traverse distances by contracting space in front of it and expanding space behind it to achieve better travel speeds.
