            A list of sci-fi weapons and tools that I'm trying to generalize, each with a plausible physics explanation. If not possible, then will be left 
            at the bottom list lol. Some "weapons" are actually really hard to attempt to explain via current physics so welp.

            <b><u><font style="font-size: 125%;color: rgb(133, 135, 255);">Electromagnetic</font></u></b>
            <br>
            <i><font style="color: rgb(255, 209, 152);">Lasers</font></i> - concentrated beam of photons at different energy levels, ranging from radio to gamma. 
            Damages targets through the delivery of vast amounts of energy via photons.
            <br>
            <i><font style="color: rgb(255, 209, 152);">Ion propulsion-based weapons</font></i> - the propulsion of highly energetic particles, usually in a beam.
            Usually the propulsed particle is an atom in which propulsion is acheived through magnetic fields or something similar. Since charged particles rapidly
            diverge due to the occurance of similar electric charges, right before exit, adding additional electrons to the propulsed particle or of the like would 
            create a better beam, since neutral particles will not diverge as fast as charged ones.
            <br>
            <i><font style="color: rgb(255, 209, 152);">Chemical reactions</font></i> - an uncontrolled or controlled release of energy created via chemical reactions.
            Can be in the form of an explosion or detonation such as a missile, or in the form of a concentrated beam of energetic particles with the energy created 
            by said chemical reactions.
            <br>
            <i><font style="color: rgb(255, 209, 152);">EMPs</font></i> - a pulse of electromagnetic radiation, created by objects that can generate large amounts of 
            electromagnetic energy, usually in a beam or shockwave used to short-wire electronics.
            <br>
            <i><font style="color: rgb(255, 209, 152);">Railguns</font></i> - a weapon that uses magnetic fields to accelerate objects, ranging from relatively small
            to arbitrarily large in size whom are able to interact with a magnetic field either due to compatable charge or spin, to a high speed to incapacitate or 
            destroy an entity.
            <br>
            <i><font style="color: rgb(255, 209, 152);">Magnetic fields</font></i> - a magnetic field which may be extremely powerful, such as one around a trillion 
            tesla or of the like, which can be used to redirect particles capable of interacting with it. A "force field" can be created via this.
            <br>
            <i><font style="color: rgb(255, 209, 152);">Grey goo</font></i> - small machines with components are at or near the scale of a nanometer(i.e. nanomachines), 
            programmed to make more copies of itself with surrounding resources indefinitely, not dissimilar to a real-life fork bomb. It is to be noted that 
            <font style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">the ability to create more copies of itself via resources around it may sometimes be unfeasible</font> due to lack of 
            <i>correct</i> resources, though it is not to be said grey goo is not dangerous if created.
            <br>
            <i><font style="color: rgb(255, 209, 152);">Neutron-pasta based weapon</font></i> - by taking out and keeping neutron pasta compressed from a neutron star 
            through the use of very strong magnetic fields, or <font style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">graviton manipulation</font>; or by compressing neutrons via 
            magnetic fields or <font style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">graviton manipulation</font> to create neutron pasta, then transporting said neutron pasta 
            to an area and decompress it, returning the neutron pasta to normal density, an energetic explosion could be created.

            <b><u><font style="font-size: 125%;color: rgb(133, 135, 255);">Strong and weak interaction</font></u></b>
            <br>
            <i><font style="color: rgb(255, 209, 152);">Fusion and fission based nuclear reactions</font></i> - a controlled or uncontrolled release of energy created by 
            the fusion or fission of atomic nuclei, typically uranium-237 or plutonium-241 for fission based reactions and deuterium or hydrogen for fusion based reactions.
            <br>
            <i><font style="color: rgb(255, 209, 152);">Strangelets</font></i> - a negatively charged droplet of up, down, and strange quarks in roughly equal ratios, 
            capable of converting normal matter into strange matter. The dissolution of particles, notably neutrons into individual quarks in quark-gluon plasma lowers its 
            energy state, which in turn may be more stable than normal matter.
        </p>
            <br><center><img style="width: 25%;" src="./strange-quark-feynman.png"></center>
        <p>
            The production of strange quarks shown above results in the formation of strange matter. <font style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">If the negative charge of strange 
            and down quarks dominates more than the positive charge of up quarks</font>, then negatively charged strange matter will not be repelled by positively charged 
            normal matter as per the Coulomb repulsion force and convert any atomic nuclei it is able to interact with into more strange matter. If the strangelet is positively
            charged, it may still be able to interact with atomic nuclei by overcoming Coulomb repulsion through kinetic energy though further interactions will not get far, 
            making positively charged strangelets practically useless as a weapon.
            <br>
            <i><font style="color: rgb(255, 209, 152);">Matter-antimatter annihilation</font></i> - by keeping matter and antimatter suspended via a magnetic field or 
            <font style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">graviton manipulation</font>, one can transport such to a target place and cause annihilation, converting the matter and
            antimatter into energy which may cause damage.

            <b><u><font style="font-size: 125%;color: rgb(133, 135, 255);">Gravity</font></u></b>
            <br>
            <i><font style="color: rgb(255, 209, 152);">Induced black hole</font></i> - sudden compression of a particle or group of particles such that escape velocity 
            from the region in which it is concentrated exceeds the speed of light. The minimum required energy for a creation of such in 4 dimensional spacetime is 10<sup>16</sup>
            TeV, and can be acheived by suddenly compressing charged particles or colliding them at high speeds and confining them to a small space such that an event horizon is 
            formed. <font style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Graviton manipulation</font> could also be used to create the black hole. Since the particles creating the black hole 
            has charge, it can be propelled via magnetic fields as a form of "gun", or left at its materialization spot to cause destruction via the absorption of surrounding 
            matter. Also note that such black holes if not able to sustain themselves will evaporate via Hawking Radiation so induced black holes that evaporate too quickly to 
            be used as a matter absorption weapon can be also used as a bomb.

            <b><u><font style="font-size: 125%;color: rgb(133, 135, 255);">Large-scale destruction</font></u></b>
            <br>
            <i><font style="color: rgb(255, 209, 152);">Black hole bomb</font></i> - by building a large structure of encompassing mirrors, one can harvest and hold energy from 
            a spinning black hole's ergosphere via the Penrose process and superradiant scattering in which concentrating it can create an uncontrolled explosion. Depending on 
            mirror integrity, it can acheive an explosion comparable to a supernova.
            <br>
            <i><font style="color: rgb(255, 209, 152);">Vacuum decay</font></i> - <font style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">if the Higgs field is metastable</font>, 
            through an active trigger such as a very energetic explosion/collision and induced quantum tunneling, or through a passive trigger such as a black hole, 
            the false vacuum can decay into a true vacuum, expanding in a sphere through spacetime that will destroy present configurations of matter 
            when the bubble's walls reach it, and inside the true vacuum, physics may be completely different than usual. The expanding bubble of true 
            vacuum has positive surface tension, since energy is expended as the fields roll over the potential barrier to the true vacuum. The former ir proportional to the 
            cube of the bubble's radius while the latter is proportional to the square of its radius, so there is a critical size in which the bubble can grow; as a result
            bubbles below the critical size will shrink, vice versa. This means bubbles with a radius below critical size could be used for wiping out smaller areas of
            spacetime without endangering the universe itself. Small bubbles of true vacuum can also be inflated to the critical size by providing energy and expand
            towards infinity with its speed approaching the speed of light extremely quickly <font style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">if there is a large difference in energy 
            between the false and true vacuums</font>. The bubble itself also does not produce any gravitational effects because the negative energy density of the bubble 
            interior is cancelled out by the positive kinetic energy of the wall.

            <i><font style="color: rgb(255, 209, 152);">Supernova catapult</font></i> - by changing the velocity of a dying star and directing it towards a target via
            stellar engines, the star may undergo supernova near or at the target and destroy the target as a result.

            <br>
            <i><font style="color: rgb(255, 209, 152);">Chemical agents</font></i> - a molecule that is able to impair the function of another cell based biological entity.
            For instance, blocking receptors in the nervous system or triggering necrosis upon contact.

            <i><font style="color: rgb(255, 209, 152);">Biological agents</font></i> - a usually biological entity like a bacterium, virus, or prion that is able to harm 
            or destroy other usually cell based biological entities.
            <br>
            <i><font style="color: rgb(255, 209, 152);">Propulsion weapons</font></i> - a weapon that uses a variety of methods such as chemical, electric, or air 
            pressure to accelerate an object at an entity with the intent to incapacitate it, not dissimlar to a railgun.

            <i><font style="color: rgb(255, 209, 152);">Time related weapons</font></i> - a weapon that can somehow manipulate or change time passage in a region of spacetime.

            <i><font style="color: rgb(255, 209, 152);">Dimensional collapse weapons</font></i> - a weapon that can collapse the dimension of spacetime into a lower one, 
            typically occurring in a sphere like structure at the speed of light. <font style="color: rgb(161, 255, 247);">A civilization may be able to survive via 
            computer emulation of higher dimensions. For example, the Rule 110 cellular automaton is Turing complete, which means that given enough time and space it 
            can do anything that a normal computer can do down to 1 dimension, and by using such, higher dimensions can be simulated in the lower dimension. As for 0 dimensions,
            possibly something to do with a singularity may work since a singularity has infinite density within a single point in space. There are no negative dimensions.</font>

            accelerating object is lowered to hamper travel. <font style="color: rgb(161, 255, 247);">There is no current mechanism to lower <i>c</i> that I can think of.
            I originally though by inducing photon mass through the Higgs Field or by creating a scalar field that induces photon mass, <i>c</i> may be lowered, but it appears
            that the speed a photon travels does not affect <i>c</i>. If <i>c</i> were to be decreased in some manner, it would impact both electromagnetic constants in Maxwell's
            equations by some factor <i>n<1</i>, making electric fields <i>n</i> times stronger and magnetic fields <i>1/n</i> times as strong. The fine structure constant <i>α</i>
            would increase, therefore making larger structures such as large atomic nuclei or larger molecules unstable are <i>α</i> gets larger. Reducing <i>c</i> also causes
            nuclear energy production to decrease as per <i>e=mc<sup>2</sup></i>, making stars shrink as they reach a new equilibrium with gravity.</font>

            <i><font style="color: rgb(255, 209, 152);">Disabling the electromagnetic field</font></i> - the ability to disable the electromagnetic field in a given region of

            of atomic nuclei due to the strong force taking over.
