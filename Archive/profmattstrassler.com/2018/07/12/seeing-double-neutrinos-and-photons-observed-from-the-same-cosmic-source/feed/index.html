					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2018/07/12/seeing-double-neutrinos-and-photons-observed-from-the-same-cosmic-source/#comment-368954&quot;&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt;.

The concept of temporary energy conservation violation often arises due to oversimplifying the situation and regarding virtual particles as real particles that appear separate from anything else. This is most obvious in &#039;empty space&#039;. This idea runs into all sorts of problems when dealing with virtual particles with a rest mass. (Since it demands they all be &#039;on shell&#039;)

A better, though still inaccurate analogy is the &#039;borrows energy from the universe&#039; one. This still runs into the issues of the &#039;violation model&#039; but gives the more accurate impression that there must be an energy source to produce the particles. In empty space this can be vacuum energy while in the case of your particles it is their potential energy and\or that of the field between them.

So in your case we can imagine the virtual particles as shortlived actual particles that form at a specific point, requiring energy to do so, travel then are annihilated, returning their energy to the system. Good enough for pop-science.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[An experiment needs a concrete question for its conception. If the question is the result of a mathematical formalism, the result of the experiment is correspondingly theoretically loaded. If, then, the measurable results are preselected and only &quot;indirectly&quot; connected with the postulated objects of the theory, then there is nothing to oppose to the arbitrariness of interpretation. “Invented&quot; science is nothing more than a dogmatic process.

There is no single direct neutrino detection.

Neutrino mass change the phenomenological conditions fundamentally.

Beta-Minus-Decay…, remember: If the anti-electron neutrino, with whatever lower mass limit, gets the &quot;missing&quot; energy from the laboratory system and &quot;act&quot; only through the weak interaction, then that simply means that already in the process of weak interaction a kinetic energy continuum of the postulated neutrino had to be present. Because after this process there is no further interaction possibility according to postulate. But how should this be explained phenomenologically?

The statement of the SM that the beta-minus decay of the neutron, according to the conversion of a d-quark into a u-quark, takes place via negatively charged W bosons does not say anything about the concrete process, how, where and why the anti-Electron neutrino now during the weak interaction absorbs different amounts of energy to compensate for the &quot;missing&quot; energy in the electron spectrum.

On closer inspection, the situation is far more complex, since both the quark-based neutron and the quark-based proton have ~ 99% of undefined binding energy, and thus the weak interaction (energetically) affects only ~ 1% of the decay process.

So in the image of the SM we have 1 u quark and 2 d quarks in the meantime, a W boson and ~ 99% binding energy (whatever that phenomenologically means) and after the conversion 2 u quarks, 1d quark, 99% binding energy, 1 anti-electron neutrino, 1 electron and additionally ~ 0.78 MeV energy. No matter what the ~ 0.78 MeV energy distribution capabilities on proton (2 u quarks, 1d quark, 99% binding energy), electron and anti-electron neutrino may look like, the weak interaction process should already be such that these distribution possibilities are ensured because after the weak interaction no energy release of the neutrino to the proton and electron is possible. But this means that there can not be a discrete conversion process of a d-quark into a u-quark.

Detached from this problem, for the sake of completeness, it should also be remembered that experimentally it is not a matter of individual objects, but of many-body objects (more than one neutron), and that accelerated charges radiate energy. It is unlikely that the resulting protons and electrons are &quot;suddenly&quot; at a constant velocity. &quot;Where&quot; is the associated photon spectrum of beta-minus decay? How does it look like?

Furthermore: The concept of the de Broglie matter wave provides some very interesting aspects. The concept of the matter wave and its &quot;measurability&quot; are experimentally secured and experimentally reproducible compared to neutrino existence and neutrino interaction postulates.

There was no real-object phenomenology for the massless neutrino, and even the &quot;mixed calculation&quot; for neutrino masses is nothing more than a formalized fiction.

Moving masses produce mass-inherent matter waves. Since the de Broglie matter wave depends only on the rest mass and the velocity of the &quot;particle&quot;, the concept of the matter wave generally applies. Here it would be, with regard to SM postulated theory objects and interaction scenarios, to note that the postulated complex (encapsulated) quarks-gluon-xxx structure has no influence on the de Broglie matter wave, proofs: de Broglie matter waves of the neutron-, proton-, molecules- and Fullerene-de Broglie matter waves. A neutrino with mass has a de Broglie matter wave dependent on the total energy. All moving neutrinos, regardless of their postulated origin, “have” matter waves. 

The only possibility to escape from this phenomenological neutrino-desaster is to explain why and how the de Broglie matter-wave for moving neutrino-masses is non-existent.

A basic standard model fiction consists in the assumption that mass carriers must follow different mathematical rules. These rules are then summarized in supposedly physical theories. The Standard Model is a collection of philosophical* model ideas, the extension of the Standard Model, whereby neutrino masses must be understood as a brute expansion and supersymmetry as a &quot;standard model killer&quot;, exacerbates this aspect. The &quot;standard concept view&quot; was and is doomed epistemologically to failure because, simply speaking, no consistent phenomenology of mass, space or electric charge exists.

*In today&#039;s standard-model-oriented thinking “findings” are theoretically postulated which are then selectively searched for, using computer-simulated &quot;experimental setups&quot;. This theory-based search has no direct evidence and can be allways somehow interpreted. 25 free parameters, variable coupling constants, several dozen postulated essential theoretical objects, various substructuring theses, confinement thesis, ... create any kind of “needed”  results. You don’t have to be a phycisist to understand that the postulated &quot;fragmentation of matter&quot; leads to irrelevant knowledge. Instead of simplification, this formal postulation and &quot;refining theories&quot; obviously do not end in the growth of knowledge but in scientific arbitrariness. 

One more thing: 
To generate the fermion masses by coupling the fermions to the Higgs field, the following conditions must be met: The masses of the right-handed and left-handed fermions must be the same. The neutrino must remain massless. This basic condition stands in a blatant contradiction to neutrino oscillations (Nobel Prize 2015), which necessarily presuppose neutrino masses. Consequence: One either abandons the standard model of particle physics (SM) or of mass neutrinos. A magnetic moment of neutrinos is &quot;forbidden&quot; for mathematical reasons within the framework of the standard model. (Does this mean anything? Obviously formerly forbidden masses are now “just fine”.) But there are no experiments that exclude a magnetic moment of the neutrino.
The consideration of a magnetic moment of a neutrino with mass and the fundamental interaction aspects are buried under a mountain of arbitrary mathematics. A magnetic moment of a neutrino would not be measurable in the isolated laboratory experiment due to the postulated &quot;smallness&quot;, but in the context of cosmic dimensions it would encounter a multitude of interaction partners.

					<description><![CDATA[So, if one assumes the neutrino is first in the transition from bosons to fermions since both the photons and neutrinos were created at the same time then what converts the neutrino into a stable electron? Or is the creation of electrons totally independent of the collisions that created the neutrino?

Here&#039;s another outrageous idea. Is gravity a pseudo force? The assumption here is that space and energy are the same &quot;thing&quot;. And that Space ~ Energy, as one observes small spaces the energies in that volume increases. So, gravity is the inertial force created by the distortions of space caused by the different energies of the particles in any given space.

That&#039;s it for me now, I got a headache. Cheers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dr.Strassler:
Another excellent article, I enjoy your articles very much.  I don’t mean to “highjack” this thread, but I have a question about another article you wrote some years back about virtual particles.  That article really cleared up a lot on the nature of virtual particles as being really a disturbance in the field.  My question is this:  if I force two electrons together, the work I do forcing them together appears as energy in the field between them.
It is then often said that the “force” being mediated between the particles is done thru virtual photons, that temporarily violates energy conservation.  My question is why is this a violation of energy conservation?  The energy is there, in the field, I put it there when I forced the two particles together doing work.
I can see in free space that the popping into existence of two particles and subsequent annilation temporary vilolates energy conservation.  But how would that apply to two particles I just “worked” on forcing them together?  The particles are already in existence, and I forced them together.  I apologize again for highjacking the topic of this thread, I posted this question on the other thread, but I think that thread was already closed.]]></description>
