					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2018/02/05/a-brilliant-light-disappears-over-the-horizon-in-memory-of-joe-polchinski/#comment-363791&quot;&gt;Curious George&lt;/a&gt;.

D-branes in protons are currently borderline observable --- you can spin a proton just the way I described the spinning of mesons, and you see evidence, just as you do for mesons, that a string forms just as it does in a meson.  But now it can&#039;t be between a quark and an anti-quark, as it is for a meson; it must be between a quark and something else.  That something else must have a number of technical properties, and those are consistent, in retrospect, with the properties of a D-brane.  Clearly, this is only an indirect observation, but it&#039;s an observation nonetheless.

I don&#039;t know the best way to observe D-branes directly, in this or other contexts.  It may be that certain exotic mesons may be D-brane bound states, but it won&#039;t be easy to prove that.  It may also be that there are condensed matter systems --- perhaps certain superconductors --- where D-branes are easier to observe than they are in protons and neutrons.   I am sure, however, that it is a matter of time and technology, not a matter of principle.

By the way, here&#039;s who you&#039;re looking at if you stop the video at 0:55.  On the panel: Greg Moore, one of the world&#039;s great mathematical physicists, and a brane expert, is at our left; he was my faculty colleague for a time at Rutgers. Then Andreas Karch, who was my faculty colleague at Washington, who invented a wonderfully simple and influential way to add quarks to Maldacena-like theories using D-branes.  Clifford Johnson, a USC prof, is my age and I&#039;ve known him for many years; he literally wrote the book on D-branes, https://www.amazon.com/D-Branes-Cambridge-Monographs-Mathematical-Physics/dp/0521809126 , and wrote lots of beautiful papers about them. And on the right, Samir Mathur, between my age and Joe&#039;s is one of the world&#039;s experts on the information paradox, and has used D-branes widely in that work.  The intro was given by David Gross himself (former KITP director and Nobel Prize 2004).

In the audience: front row from left, John Preskill of Caltech, Juan Maldacena in the yellow shirt, Eva Silverstein of Stanford in green, Joe, Andy Strominger of Harvard; second row: just off screen is Don Marolf (mentioned in the article), then Igor Klebanov of Princeton, me, Rob Leigh of Illinois, someone I don&#039;t recognize, Lenny Susskind of Stanford and Raphael Bousso of Berkeley.  Unfortunately I don&#039;t recognize the others in that shot.]]></description>
