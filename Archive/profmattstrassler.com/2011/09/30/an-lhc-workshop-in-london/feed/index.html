					<description><![CDATA[I dont know why you say that, I have a good track record predicting that the LHC results were not as good as they looked in July - before it became clear in August, as well as questioning the results of Opera on your blog before everyone else joined in. I think the issue with supersymmetry is not whether it has been ruled out - it is likely it will never be - but whether it is relevant. The latest results from the LHC are a serious blow to supersymmetry in that aspect. They indicate that, unlike what had been hoped for, supersymmetry can not explain EW unification.]]></description>

People used this argument in the past to predict there would be no neutral currents (i.e. no Z particle) and were wrong.  They used it to predict that there would be no neutrino masses, and were wrong.  Nobody expected the muon.  In fact, back in the 1920s there was no reason to expect the neutron.  And in the 1800&#039;s, someone taking your point of view would have failed to predict all the as-yet unknown elements in the periodic table.  I don&#039;t think history agrees that taking a minimalist approach is always a good idea.   Sometimes it is, sometimes it is not.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The first line above should read &#039;objective&#039; not &#039;subjective&#039; - its a pity I can&#039;t edit this thing.

I should like to mention one thing in connection with what I said above. The main problem plaguing all major theories devised since the seventies is a plethora of extra particles  which these theories predict in addition to those that are actually known to exist. This applies in equal measure to variations of technicolor, supersymmetry, and superstrings.  This is actually indicative of the excessive numbers of degrees of freedom present in those systems. It is relatively easy to fit an experiment to a theory with the number of degrees of freedom exceeding the number present in the experiment -  but the fact that that&#039;s all you have done is reflected in the extra degree&#039;s of freedom left over - as such the extra particles should be welcomed not loathed. Nature has been quite sparse in the number of degrees of freedom it uses. So I think we will know we have come up with the right unification theory when using the least parameters we predict the universe and no more.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[People making a living in the field are not necessarily subjective when it comes to making a judgement of when its time to put supersymmetry on the back burner. This is aggrevated by the fact that there are no real alternatives to turn to - this is why theres so much interest in Opera - though most people dont really believe it. The trouble is that physics has been in the doledrums as far as successful new ideas are concerned since the early severnties, and the likely imminent failure of the Higgs scenario, which dates back from the sixties, shows that even that is too optimistic. It is beginning to look like , gravity and QFT are just not unifying (without suppersymmetry and a plethora of particles) and with the Higgs in trouble, even what we have thought we had unified appears to be coming apart. I suspect the two failures are not unrelated. 

To help demonstrate how difficult the situation is, using something familiar to those acquainted with rudimentary quantum mechanics, consider the early 20&#039;th century before quantum mechanics was invented. One knew light is emitted in quanta, Einstein (a subsequent opponent of QM) even proposed that the electric field itself is quantized (photons), they also knew that the Rutherford model of the atom with electrons orbiting the nucleus conflicted with Maxwell&#039;s theory that accelerating charges should radiate - so the planetary atom was unstable. Imagine experimental input then suddenly coming to an end, with scientists left for a century, just on the back of that, to explain atomic structure - no emission spectra, no Zeeman effect, no new particles, nothing else. One can imagine all sorts of mechanical and statistical systems being invented with ever more comlicated interactions - because that is all people knew, and the only things that had worked before.  But nobody in  their right mind would have come up with quantum mechanics, to wit, that below this world of order there is a huge lotery going on. Today the situation is that to do just one experiment, of predictive value perhaps even less than a simple Zeeman splitting measurement, one requires a world collaboration such as the LHC, using money that perhaps never again will be available if nothing is found. One can see the scale of the problem there.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What is the name of the conference &#038; can you post a link?  I couldn&#039;t find it via Google. It&#039;s ~3am here (2 block from Caltech)

I&#039;ve been &quot;up&quot; for nearly 7 straight days (on computer, working until I doze off) in search of a systematic error (non-obvious) for OPERA.  Between me &#038; couple of FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) specialists (Caltech PhD &#038; xxx) &#038; Ethernet expert (Honeywell/Advanced Technology Engineering), there could be a time-stamping snafu in the TT (target Tracker)/FPGA.  I.e., more &quot;sigma&quot; (uncertainty) than modeled/stated in the paper, which could invalidate the 6 sigma claim.  We&#039;re in touch with OPERA co-authors, trying to determine the accuracy 100Mhz clock on FPGA (10 nsec period, the basis for the time-stamp), synthesized via PLL (Phase Locked Loop) from the OPERA master clock (derived from GPS atomic clock).  PLL has these 2 &quot;uncertainties&quot;: static phase-offset (what model?) &#038; phase-noise (probabilistic model, w/sigma)..NOT mentioned in the OPERA paper.  This COULD be the source of systematic error -- jitter in the PLL sourced 100 Mhz clock (reference for time-stamping).

The ECM (Ethernet Controller Module) board contains the FPGA, which is an implementation of the &quot;Network [ Ethernet ] Architecture for DAQ [ Data Acquisition ]&quot;.  The latter being a new generation architecture, going beyond the VME (Versabus Module Europa, circa late 80&#039;s!!) based DAQ used in LEP-LHC (1980 - 2007).  I went as far as to check the Japanese Super-Kamiokande neutrino experiment, &#038; Fermilab/MINOS -- they show a VME bus in DAQ, so it appears as if they DON&#039;T use the above DAQ (Ethernet/Network based) architecture.  This might correlate why OPERA is seeing super-luminal neutrinos &#038; 2 other neutrino experiments AREN&#039;T.  I&#039;ve already emailed the MINOS team (UCL/Univ College London, Caltech, Harvard collaboration members), about what DAQ they&#039;re using -- no response yet.  About to send email query to Super Kamio-kande collaborators.

&lt;b&gt;Bottomline:&lt;/b&gt; the OPERA DAQ system is fairly new (commissioned in summer 2006), &#038; may be buggy.  It&#039;s using an industrial grade hardware for a high-end Physics application (requires nsec accuracy).  I found a paper by an OPERA co-author about the OPERA DAQ, where it states:

&quot;not much user experience compared to VME [ used in LHC &#038; others ]&quot;
&quot;main targets are large telecommunication companies, not universities [ OPERA collaborators ]&quot;
&quot;where do physicists meet industry?  Towards physics compatible std&quot;

I get this feeling it COULD be a case of &quot;wrong tool for the wrong job&quot;:

&quot;I keep telling you.  The Right Tool for the RIGHT JOB&quot;
-- Scotty/engineer, &quot;Star Trek&quot;

Stay tuned..]]></description>
