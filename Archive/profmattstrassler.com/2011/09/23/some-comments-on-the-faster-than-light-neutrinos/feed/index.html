					<description><![CDATA[I think that what you said was very logical. However, what 
about this? suppose you were to create a awesome headline?
I am not saying your content isn&#039;t good, however suppose you 
added a post title to maybe get people&#039;s attention?
I mean Some Comments on the Faster Than Light Neutrinos &#124; Of Particular Significance is a little plain.
You ought to glance at Yahoo&#039;s front page 
and see how they write post titles to get people to click.
You might add a video or a related picture or two to grab readers interested about everything&#039;ve 
got to say. Just my opinion, it could bring your posts a little livelier.]]></description>
