					<description><![CDATA[Three days ago at TEDx Flanders conference, Tommaso Dorigo made a &quot;joke&quot; about the secret that Higgs was already found. The following is the quote of his speech.

&quot;...Can I say whether it&#039;s there ?
I hesitate... You all look trustworthy and I&#039;m willing to buy that each of you would keep the secret within these walls, but Peter here is such a loudmouth with his blog!
The problem is that when in my blog I write something I should keep secret, I  get my colleagues all angry at me. See, I could live with the standard punishments, such as a ban from presenting results at conferences (I did get that once)…. 

More exciting is that unlike previous experiments, at CERN we now have the sensitivity to find the darn thing, and maybe we are finally seeing it and measuring its mass.
So before you learn it from the press, I can tell you that the Higgs mass is…….. 119 whatchamacallits, give or take a few whatchamacallits. You can tell your grandma if you like, but please don&#039;t tell Peter!&quot;

Is this a joke? or a genuine hint? Do you have any inside info on this?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Re OPERA: (I&#039;m sorry if this comment is in the wrong place, but it might not be the sort of question you wanted in the previous post)

Given that electron neutrinos can oscillate into muon neutrinos, and vice versa, and that the SN1987A neutrino wavepackets were localized enough to appear within a 14 second interval, shouldn&#039;t the SN1987A neutrinos all have oscillated many times, &lt;i&gt;at random times&lt;/i&gt;, during the journey from SN1987A to Earth?  The consequence of this being that if the OPERA velocity measurement is correct, the SN1987A neutrino arrival times should have been uniformly smeared out over the preceding 3 years, and no spike should have been seen at all?

(I should acknowledge that this point was suggested to me by the abstract of &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.5368&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;1109.5368&lt;/a&gt;, but Fargion&#039;s suggestion seems to be different.)]]></description>
