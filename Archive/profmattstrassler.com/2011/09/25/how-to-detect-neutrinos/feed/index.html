Billionths, yes; trillionths, no.  I gave a better start of an answer to your question where you asked it as a comment on https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/neutrinos-faster-than-light/opera-some-arguments-against/opera-vs-icarus/ , so check there ... though as you&#039;ll see I didn&#039;t give a completely satisfactory response.]]></description>

Regarding the evolution of knowledge: Great question!  I don&#039;t know of a good source, and will have to look into it.  If anyone else has a suggestion let us know.  There are many physicists more expert on neutrinos than I am, and maybe one of them knows of a good source.

As for the water detectors --- their role has been huge in the last 30 years.  I don&#039;t think I could summarize it all off the top of my head; I guess at some point I&#039;ll have to write some articles about that.  But suffice it to say that much of what we learned about neutrinos during my career comes from detectors that just sit and wait for a neutrino to hit something in a huge vat of water, kicking off one or more charged particles that emit light as they travel through the water.  [And why do these fast charged particles emit light?  Because although they don&#039;t violate Einstein&#039;s speed limit, they travel faster in the water than light does!  Just as an airplane that goes faster than sound emits a sonic boom, an electrically-charged particle that goes faster than light in a medium (such as water or ice) makes a photonic boom!  This is called &quot;Cerenkov radiation&quot;, and it is very often used in high-energy-particle detectors.]  

We can expect a good future for ice detectors too, such as ICE CUBE at the South Pole.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Where can I learn more about the evolution of knowledge of neutrinos?  What is the significance of the water detectors?

Thank you for all the time you put in to explaining these concepts to the laymen.  It is all so exciting.]]></description>
