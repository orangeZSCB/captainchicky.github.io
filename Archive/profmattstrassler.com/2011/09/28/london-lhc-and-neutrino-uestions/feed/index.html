					<description><![CDATA[The OPERA team should be congratulated not for beating the speed of light, but for being the first to measure the rest mass of a neutrino. Presumably the neutrinos were (incorrectly) considered to have been sent at the time of impact. However the Eigenfunction of the neutrino would become significant when the distance between colliding particles is in the order of the wavelength of the neutrino at rest. This happens at the time 6E-08 seconds before the impact. The frequency ν (nu) of the neutrino is the reciprocal 1/(6E-08) seconds. From mc^2 = h ν (nu) the rest mass of the neutrino can be calculated approximately 2E-41 grams.

See today&#039;s post (11/20) and work backwards; my post https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/10/26/a-few-tidbits-from-nagoya-including-opera-news/ answers some of your questions, and look in the comment section for words about the MINOS experiment&#039;s plans.

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/09/28/london-lhc-and-neutrino-uestions/#comment-853&quot;&gt;a bad physics student&lt;/a&gt;.

I feel I have answered this question a couple of times ...hmm,  are the questions disappearing off the webpages now?  (The system is still new to me.)  The point in the end requires a calculation: the answer is, NO, the photon does not pick up a mass from quantum loop effects.  This is *not* instantly obvious but it is true.  There are a number of errors in your reasoning, but in the end the answer comes down to the fact that the photon interacts via conserved currents, and all the effects that you describe cancel out.  The main effect of the process you describe, in the end, is on the force the photon exerts, which turns out to depend on distance in a way that is no longer exactly 1/r^2.]]></description>

Right -- my point was that LIGO is an extraordinarily sensitive instrument and can detect incredibly faint gravitational waves, whereas any gravitational waves big enough to have any effect (leaving aside the fact that it would be the wrong effect) on OPERA would be large enough that we would have detected them long ago.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Matt. Thanks for the answer. 
But i was thinking more about distance travelled/elapsed time on the ground, than the gps system.
The LIGO experiment came to my mind. Pity OPERA only has one beam.

There are many possible answers, but here&#039;s a simple one: anything (including gravity waves) that could affect space and time themselves at the level claimed by OPERA would screw up the GPS system.]]></description>
