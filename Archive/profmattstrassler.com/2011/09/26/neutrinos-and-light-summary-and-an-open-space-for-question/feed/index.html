Great comment.  I lend more support to a shock-wave effect causing an anti-matter ripple that initially slow neutrino&#039;s.  I believe there is more work needed to understand the relationships.  I feel the mass density of, and the distance/time from, the occurrence are significant contributors to the equations with regards to neutrino oscillation along the ripple.  Also, something like gravitational pull from black holes have produced a slingshot effect and that may be another factor.]]></description>

Interesting suggestion.  Nice words.  Equations count for more, however.   I wonder how you explain why the neutrinos from supernova 1987a arrived within a few hours of the supernova&#039;s light, despite the fact that, according to your thinking, the light had to follow the curved space between here and the supernova, while the neutrinos did not.]]></description>

Not if the mass is small enough.  You are right, the supernova neutrino observations put an upper bound on neutrino masses, because if the masses had been large enough, the neutrino speeds would have been far enough below light speed that the neutrino arrivals would have been noticeably spread out in time.  But any neutrino with a mass-energy below a few 1000s of eV was ok, if I remember.  Meanwhile it is typically concluded,  from neutrino oscillations and cosmology, that neutrino masses are probably below 1 eV, with the heaviest only  about .1 eV.  The actual masses remain to be measured.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The OPERA experiment tries to match a proton &quot;probability distribution function&quot; (W(t)) with the rather sparsely sampled neutrino &quot;probability distribution function&quot; (protons ~ 10^9/ns, neutrinos ~ 0.5/ns), by computing   

Product( W(ti + &#948;t) where ti are the neutrino arrival times, and &#948;t is chosen to maximize the product, and is interpreted as the delay.  

The problem with this measure is that it is significant only where (W&#039;/W) is large, i.e., at the edges.  My numerical experiments  using a reduced data set measured from the edges of the  first extraction in the OPERA paper show that just removing the single earliest neutrino in the first bin in the first extraction or adding a neutrino in the (empty) second 50ns bin in the first extraction is enough to shift &#948;t by 5-6ns.  The standard error really depends on what you have at the edges - where the statistics are the worst.

My question is that is there not a better estimate for &#948;t using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test? 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Smirnov_test
The K-S test uses cumulative probability distributions (CPDF) and is less sensitive to the details of the edges than the OPERA measure. The K-S statistic is max( CPDF1-CPDF2) where CPDF1,2 are the two cumulative probability distributions.  One would find the &#948;t which minimizes the K-S statistic.  If the K-S statistic turned out to depend on the beginning or tail of the CPDFs then we&#039;d know the problem is with the poor statistics at the front and tail of the PDFs.  But really, the K-S statistic should be arising from the middle of the CPDF where the accumulated statistics are good.

Thanks in advance for your feedback!]]></description>
