					<description><![CDATA[Hi professor! The media is sometimes confusing, if they reported that a supernova photon stream came from a galaxy 20 million lightyears away, am I right to conclude that the supernova event happened 20 millions years ago? because it take time for the photons to travel.

					<description><![CDATA[In AWT based on dense aether model the neutrinos aren&#039;t real tachyons, they&#039;re just a solitons of longitudinal waves of vacuum (i.e. gravitational waves) and as such only slightly superluminal (you can imagine them as a Falaco solitons at the water surface, which are always moving slightly faster, than surface ripples) and they do represent the lightweight photinos of SUSY. Photons are supersymmetric bosons, they&#039;re always spreading in lower speed than the light waves and they correspond the Russel&#039;s solitons at the water surface. From this reason I do believe, the OPERA result is substantiated well and it will confirmed later in indepenedent observations.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/09/20/supernovas-and-neutrinos/#comment-4336&quot;&gt;balfatgit&lt;/a&gt;.

You said: &quot;Of course the ~60ns result would then imply that light has a fractionally greater mass than a neutrino. This could be explained by the observation that light (across the whole spectrum) has a wave/particle duality. In effect when the photon manifests as a wave, it travels at the cosmic speed limit, and alternatively when the photon manifests as a particle/anti-particle pair that pair then has mass and consequently does not travel at the cosmic speed limit.&quot;

This is why in physics we do calculations before we spout words.  Your last sentence is simply incorrect, as I calculate in my introductory quantum field theory class every year.  No matter how massive the virtual particle-antiparticle pair, the photon remains massless.  The mistake in your intuition can be rectified in part by reading https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/virtual-particles-what-are-they/

Moreover, we also look at experiments before we make theories.  Experiments show that the photon has a mass no greater than 0.00000000000001 eV/c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, far too small for any effect such as the one you are hoping for.]]></description>
