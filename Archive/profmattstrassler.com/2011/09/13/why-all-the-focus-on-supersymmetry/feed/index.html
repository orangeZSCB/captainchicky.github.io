					<description><![CDATA[Matt and Mark,

To give me a clue on my second question, are you basically saying that if you impose SU(5)-invariant boundary conditions on the soft SUSY-breaking masses at the GUT scale, e.g. m_q = m_u = m_e and m_d = m_l, where the subscripts denote superpartners, and evolve these down to the electroweak scale by the renormalization group, then the gluino and squark masses come out larger than the slepton, chargino, and neutralino masses, by factors related to the ratios of the gauge coupling constants at the electroweak scale?

And Mark is saying that that falls apart if you abandon the SU(5) mass relations at the GUT scale?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;a significant number of supporters... who viewed [susy&#039;s] appearance at the LHC as virtually certain&quot;

Really? I am surprised because I can only think of two people who I would put in that category (they are both mentioned in the comments). Talking to susy phenomenologists who have spent their careers working mostly on mSUGRA I get 50-50 quoted as the chance of susy showing up at the LHC.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/09/13/why-all-the-focus-on-supersymmetry/#comment-498&quot;&gt;Mark&lt;/a&gt;.

This, for the layperson who can&#039;t read physics shorthand, is Mark&#039;s way of saying -- that he essentially agrees.  He&#039;s giving a particular example of how you can easily get around the predictions of the simplest versions of grand unified theories (&quot;GUTs&quot;).]]></description>
