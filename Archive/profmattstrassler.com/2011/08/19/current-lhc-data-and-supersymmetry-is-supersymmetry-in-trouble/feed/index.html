					<description><![CDATA[Dear Professor Strassler,
To be fair to Gordy Kane, Kane and his collaborators have been promoting the model based on the fluxless G2 compactifications of M-theory for the past 4 years, at least. Look at the title of Gordy&#039;s 2008 talk here, for example: http://theory.caltech.edu/~seminar/old/2008-spring.html
 I first heard Acharya&#039;s talk on this topic way back in 2006 at KITP and I thought this stuff was a bit crazy and a bunch of crap, to be honest. However, after reading some of their later papers I now think that their model is actually quite elegant since it addresses multiple problems simultaneously and I&#039;m sure that Gordy is quite delighted with the fact that the LHC has not found any light squarks :) .
Naively, these vacua lead to a severe &quot;little hierarchy problem&quot; because of the very heavy scalars so this model has been rather unattractive to the bottom up phenomenologists but despite skepticism, Gordy has been sticking to his guns during the past 4 years and in fact, this recent paper http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.3765 demonstrated that there is a natural and large region in the parameters space of such models where the Higgs vev can be naturally below 1 TeV.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/08/19/current-lhc-data-and-supersymmetry-is-supersymmetry-in-trouble/#comment-377&quot;&gt;Shantanu&lt;/a&gt;.

Circumstantial evidence, of course, and while I agree it adds a little to the body of evidence, it is not a particularly strong piece.  It might be viewed as sronger evidence, perhaps, for physics near the Planck (gravitational) energy scale than for supersymmetry.  Ramond is arguing for physics near the apparently slightly lower Grand Unification energy scale, which is traditionally thought to be different from the Planck scale, and  which would fit with the popular picture of supersymmetry and grand unification that has many adherents.  But consistency with a picture is not the same as direct evidence.

It is impossible to link any details of observable effects of supersymmetry with this indirect evidence.  For instance, the three assumptions that I have listed are completely independent of any effects leading to neutrinos masses.  So you can relax any one or more of those assumptions and keep neutrino mass physics unchanged.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Matt,
Nice post. I have a question. About 13 years ago, when Super-K announced evidence for non-0 neutrino mass, P . Ramond indicated that
the results provide evidence for low energy super-symmetry. See
http://focus.aps.org/stories/v2/st10/neutrinoquotes.html
Do you agree with this? and if yes, then based on nu-results can we predict more precisely when and in what channels low-energy SUSY will be seen?
Thanks
Shantanu]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/08/19/current-lhc-data-and-supersymmetry-is-supersymmetry-in-trouble/#comment-351&quot;&gt;Fred&lt;/a&gt;.

I agree that the current results are fantastic, and that the results have been transparent.  I don&#039;t think I downplayed them either --- as I said, those popular supersymmetric models are in serious trouble.  &lt;em&gt;[Actually, rereading it again, I&#039;ve concluded your criticism that I didn&#039;t make enough positive statements is warranted, and I&#039;ve added some text in italics above.]&lt;/em&gt;

However,  your physics statement isn&#039;t correct.  R-parity violation is definitely not needed to evade the current search techniques --- I have been saying that for years, and so have others.  [Look at my most recent paper on the subject for plots that demonstrate this explicitly.]  These include models with a light top squark, or with an extra singlet or two in the Higgs sector, or with gauge mediation and decays of the next-to-lightest-superpartner mainly to Z and Higgs, and I don&#039;t agree they are contrived.  And I remind you these models were not invented just now, but in some cases a very long time ago.

As for the axion example --- the way you phrase it is completely unfair.   &quot;No, no, don&#039;t say that publicly!  we can invent more contrived axion models to evade the bounds.&quot;  C&#039;mon.  If you want to have a serious discussion, I&#039;m happy to have it.  But if you set up a fake example and put words in my mouth that I don&#039;t say, I don&#039;t see how we can have that discussion.

And furthermore, the analogy is off-base.   The public was not paying such close attention as they are here, and a 9 billion dollar experimental facility&#039;s long-term future was not on the line.  There are consequences to making incorrect or overoptimistic statements to the press.  In my view, we need to be quite precise about what we say; the public, and the politicians that provide the money, want to know what is going on, and we will pay a price if we say one thing and then have to backtrack.  And if we disagree with each other, that&#039;s fine; it is best that the public and politicians know that there is no scientific consensus yet.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Low energy SUSY is now less likely, and the most favorable models are ruled out. One has to turn to R-parity violating models etc to save it. That&#039;s a profound experimental discovery. Its quite unfortunate to try to downplay these experimental results. 

The general way in which the LHC experimentalists have reported their results has been transparent and fair, and consistent with the way all null experimental results have been reported in the past. When ADMX reported that they had ruled out a range for the axion mass, did axion theorists jump up and down and say &quot;no, no, don&#039;t say that publicly! We can invent more contrived axion models to evade the bounds!&quot; No, theorists studied the data, accepted that it ruled out the most reasonable axion models in that mass range, and learnt from it. I think the same attitude should apply to SUSY.]]></description>
