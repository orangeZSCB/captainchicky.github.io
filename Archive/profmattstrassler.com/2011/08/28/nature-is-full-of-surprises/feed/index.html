					<description><![CDATA[Greetings I am so glad I found your web site, I really found you by error, while 
I was browsing on Askjeeve for something else, Regardless I am here now and would just like 
to say thanks a lot for a remarkable post and a all round thrilling blog (I also love the 
theme/design), I don&#039;t have time to read it all at the minute 
but I have book-marked it and also included your RSS feeds, so 
when I have time I will be back to read a lot more, Please do keep up the great 
job.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree. There will be sufficient integrated luminosity in several channels in the LHC that when the Higgs is there, and ATLAS/CMS are about to make a claim, you will also see it &#039;with the naked eye&#039; in each of the main channels. Maximum likelihood estimates, combined analysis etc are only useful with marginal statistics, but then we are not good at quantifying marginal probabilities as the LEP II Higgs saga had shown. Their main purpose are agreed ground rules for ATLAS and CMS claim to make a discovery or exclusion  (their sensitivities appear so close however, I think they are unlikely to beat each other). On another subject, I have understood now why the number of expected Higgs events in the WW and gam/gam channels are similar given the BR for the former is almost 1-on-alpha greater than the latter. At first order the WW has three leptonic decays and 6 hadronic (counting the three udbar, csbar colors). The tau/tau is not detected so only about 4% of WW decay with no jets, and this is the main reason why the two channels just about even out. Nonetheless, I have now realised the Higgs of textbooks was premature. I dont know why people were so uncareful.]]></description>
