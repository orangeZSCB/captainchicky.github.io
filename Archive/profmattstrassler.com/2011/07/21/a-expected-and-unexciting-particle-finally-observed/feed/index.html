Thank you, sirs, for catching the blunder.  Too much going on this week!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Mathew,  

Perhaps a small typo in this post?  

Isn&#039;t it the case that the Xi family has just 1 first generation quark, so that the neutral Xi_b  is made of up, strange, bottom?

See also Fermilab&#039;s press release:

Looking forward to further updates on the Higgs story!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yes, please do clarify!  Wired and LIvescience, among others, are calling this particle Xi sub b instead of Chi. Which is the proper letter?

Thanks for the blog post, though - these things are always made out to be huge discoveries in the mainstream news while real physicists like yourself know that the explanation isn&#039;t quite so simplistic.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this!  Question.  In your post you call the new quark a &quot;Chi&quot; quark (Greek letter χ) but on the Fox News report they call it &quot;Xi&quot; (Greek letter ξ, pronounced like &quot;foxy&quot; without the &quot;fo-&quot;).  I&#039;m guessing that you know what you&#039;re talking about, and somehow things got lost in translation in the Fox News Report.  Clarify?]]></description>
