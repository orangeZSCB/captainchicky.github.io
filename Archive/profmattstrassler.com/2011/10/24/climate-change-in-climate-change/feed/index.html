Sir, this is your second unpleasant and uninformed post in three days -- and this one was actually crude, and offensive to some readers.  I have therefore edited it.  Please keep in mind this is a public forum, and please be polite, or put your opinions elsewhere.]]></description>

So You are saing, that with no evidence at all (with only your doubts) for anthropogenic climachange You are (who are  &quot;We&quot;?) about to curb CO2. 
Well mister good luck. Consider not breathing,   [Abridged by host]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Mr. Motl,
The place where I live was covered with a 500 m thick ice sheet a mere 15Ky ago, just yesterday in the geological timescale. So yes, obviously I&#039;m worried about changes in climate conditions even in case they should not depend on us (which I doubt).
If the &quot;laws of nature&quot; should point to the direction of human kind extinction, it&#039;d be legal for us to amend them, or at least give a try. (I&#039;m joking of course, changing a climate trend has nothing to do with amending gravity).

But most likely, all what we have to do is to curb CO2.

Regards]]></description>

Gmack, if the observed change, whatever it is, were not caused by the humans, then it obviously had to occur very often – or all the time – during the last 4.7 billion years and it is obviously nothing to be excited or worried about, right? In the same way, it would also be irrational to try to &quot;prevent&quot; it from happening because that would be nothing less than a war against the laws of Nature. After all, the latter conclusion is mostly right even if the human contribution is significant.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[No sorry, the key question here is really whether there is something like climate change or not. 
Having cleared that point, then even if we could not prove conclusively that it is due entirely (or partly) to anthropogenic factors, we would still be in trouble right ?
I mean, if we discover tomorrow that there is an asteroid on a collision course with the earth, would you dismiss it with a shrug since it is clearly not our fault ?]]></description>
