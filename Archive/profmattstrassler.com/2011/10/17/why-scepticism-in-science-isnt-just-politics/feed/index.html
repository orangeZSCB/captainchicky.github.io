I have nothing of import to add to this discussion, but you should know that I greatly appreciate your blog posts and your patience and clarity in communicating immensely complex matters to the interested layman.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/10/17/why-scepticism-in-science-isnt-just-politics/#comment-1387&quot;&gt;Thomas Barton, JD&lt;/a&gt;.

First, only a first-rate experimentalist with a tremendous amount of detailed information would be able to &quot;suggest a rigorous experiment [etc.]&quot; that would actually do the job.  I can speculate about how one might be done, but I&#039;m not going to embarrass myself in public by spreading ideas that only a theorist could love.   If you want something done right, get an expert.  Of course the experts *are* thinking about it.  And don&#039;t rush them -- if you want it done right.  A bad design will mean an untrustworthy result  -- which is the last thing you want.

Second, it is going to be several years no matter what.  It takes time to design and build equipment, and then it has to be tested, and then it takes time to accumulate any reasonable number of neutrinos (it took OPERA 3 years of data, and they started building quite a while before that.)  So you&#039;ve no choice but to be patient.   

For scale: the solar neutrino problem was not resolved satisfactorily for 30 years.  The DAMA experiment has been claiming dark-matter detection for, what, a decade? and their signal is still not explained either as an experimental problem or as a real physical effect.   I can think of many other examples that took several years to get cleared up.  That&#039;s just the way it is.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Has anyone who has strenuously attacked the OPERA results suggested a rigorous experiment utilizing one or more of the neutrino venues to actually disprove these results or is it going to be 5 years of theoretical ridicule backed up with no rigorous experimental apparatus ?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Prof. Strassler,

I have followed Sean Carroll informatively for a long time as well.

The progression in the advancement of science is indeed important as I have learned by the progression and design of new experiments which help us understand what is going on in the universe.

http://www.fnal.gov/pub/today/archive_2011/today11-10-10_BubbleChamberReadMore.html

http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/breaking/2011/10/14/bubble-chamber-gets-more-precise-in-dark-matter-search/

Not only to see the cosmological constant as a density factor(Omega) and how this can be geometrically correlated to the universe&#039;s nature,  as the universe speeding up.
Best,]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just love Prof. Strassler s clear voice of reason  :-).

It is much needed to counter balance not so reasonable things  written in other blogs and media these times...

Cheers]]></description>
