No, no one has ever observed this extremely tiny effect.  I put it in there for logical completeness, not because I thought it was practically observable.

&quot;Why should anyone imagine that they should [radiate e+e- pairs]?&quot;  Because when you have a consistent theoretical framework that predicts all sorts of things about all the known particles of nature --- I refer to quantum field theory, which correctly predicts emission of neutrinos by the sun, absorption of neutrinos by atoms, decay of pions and W particles to neutrinos, etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. --- and which also correctly predicts Cherenkov radiation from all sorts of known particles in all sorts of well-studied situations --- you should continue using that theoretical framework until experimental tells you that it breaks down.  You should not assume: &quot;oh, because I haven&#039;t studied this particular situation, I should distrust my theoretical framework altogether.&quot;  

In other words, you certainly should &quot;imagine&quot; it; that&#039;s what prediction is all about, imagining that your theoretical framework derived from and tested on previous experiments will work in other experiments that you haven&#039;t done yet. This is induction, yes?  Fundamental to science and engineering.

If you don&#039;t do that, what was the point of science in the first place?  You&#039;d be afraid to imagine how to use engineering to design rockets into space because you&#039;d never done it before.  You&#039;d be afraid to build the Large Hadron Collider [LHC] because &quot;who knows, maybe all our laws of nature won&#039;t work for such a machine?&quot;   You&#039;d never have had any reason to think that the LHC could make Higgs particles, or even top quarks; no one had ever seen top quarks produced in proton-proton collisions before the LHC, they&#039;d all been made with proton-antiproton collisions at the Tevatron.

The point of science is to use existing frameworks and see what they predict; if experiment disagrees, then it&#039;s time to revise the framework.  But if you stop using your existing frameworks --- if you don&#039;t study the logical consequences of what you think you&#039;ve learned --- then it is impossible to make progress.

I was very careful on this website to point out that the prediction by Cohen and Glashow of Cerenkov-like emission of electron-positron pairs was a strong &lt;strong&gt;argument&lt;/strong&gt; against OPERA being a correct experiment --- but not a &lt;strong&gt;refutation&lt;/strong&gt;, because logically the argument required assuming the existing theoretical framework was not breaking down in a very subtle and surprising way.  The reason the argument was strong is that Cerenkov radiation is a ubiquitous and very simple phenomenon, and eliminating it for neutrinos without causing problems for other earlier experiments would have been a huge theoretical challenge, perhaps impossible.  But a strong argument is not a direct refutation; that had to await ICARUS&#039;s more recent result from March, where they made the same measurement as OPERA and got a different result.

In any case, OPERA was wrong.  So this is moot.  And for various technical reasons having to do with the difficulty of setting up a suitable experimental situation, I suspect no one will likely observe Cherenkov emission of any sort off of neutrinos, at least not anytime soon.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m with you as far as &quot;... any electrically-charged particle traveling faster than the speed of light will radiate bright light.&quot;

But then I see this 

&quot;Now neutrinos are not electrically charged, and at first glance they will not emit Cerenkov radiation. But this is not quite true, because neutrinos do have a very small magnetic moment (i.e., they act like extremely weak magnets) that is generated by a quantum effect involving the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces. Consequently they too will emit a very dim form of Cerenkov radiation.&quot; which leaves me a bit uncomfortable.

Has this &quot;very dim form of Cerenkov radiation&quot; ever been observed?

It appears not as I read this 

&quot;no superluminal Cherenkov like e+e- pair or gamma emission event has been directly observed inside the fiducial volume of the &quot;bubble chamber like&quot; ICARUS TPC-LAr detector&quot; 

in http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.3763

On author asks &quot;Since Neutrinos have never been observed directly making Cherenkov Radiation – why should anyone imagine they should?&quot;
