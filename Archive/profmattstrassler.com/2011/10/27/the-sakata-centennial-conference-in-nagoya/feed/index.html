[Unfortunately Wordpress&#039;s software seems to have deleted my reply, and I&#039;m short on time so I&#039;ll have to leave a short one.]  I agree with your concerns, Hamish -- though to some extent cutting back on travel has already largely happened for financial reasons.  Already I only attend conferences if necessary (e.g. I am speaking, or communicating in person with certain other attendees is essential for my research.)  Most conferences and meetings I attend by video.  As you know there are limits to this approach; sometimes one-on-one conversations are essential for full exchange of knowledge.  But our community will have to make sacrifices and compromises just like any other.]]></description>

Dear Hamish Johnston,

Physicists and other scientists working on a certain topic in smaller groups dispersed all over the world necessarily have to travel to discusse new developments in their field face to face with colleagues at conferences or to visit other institutes to maintain international collaborations. This is very important and much more efficient to achieve good progress and results than video conferences etc ...

I`ve read a similar article about astronomers seemingly having a larger footprint than the average US citizens in the German journal Physics Today.

Such discussions and corresponding investigations attacking physics and physicists or science and scientist in general are completely useless, pointless and off the base; in particular at such a nice physics blog as Prof. Strassler`s site. 

I`m sorry but such comments (in particular if meant seriously ?) really disgust me :-(

(I dont mind if Prof. Straossler decides td delete my comment)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Matt
I couldn&#039;t help noticing that your blog entry on climate change was followed by a flying visit to Japan. We recently published an article about how physicists could set an example by reducing their carbon footprint -- not surprisingly, cutting down on conference travel figured highly. I wonder if you considered not travelling to Japan for that reason? You can read the article here: http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/indepth/47336
Cheers
