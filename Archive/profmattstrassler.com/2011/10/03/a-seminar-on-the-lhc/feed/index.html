					<description><![CDATA[Good that You had a good time giving the seminar :-)

In my opinion, the white- or blackboard is still the medium which is best suited to explain a theoretical topic.
I just love Prof. Susskinds online &quot;Stanford Ongoing Studies&quot; lectures where he patiently derives and develops step by step on a whiteboard what he wants to explain, interspersed with very nice and clear drawings and a good portion of cool humor (which a lot of theoretical physicist seem to posses as I have noted  ;-)...)

I look forward to watch his two string courses during winter time when the outdoor activities cease a bit ... :-)

Cheers]]></description>
