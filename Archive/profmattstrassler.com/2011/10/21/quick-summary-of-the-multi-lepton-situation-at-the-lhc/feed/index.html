True in principle.  I was referring to a Standard Model (SM) Higgs; outside of the SM, the rate for Higgs --&#062; two photons could be larger.   Specifically for a fourth generation, it&#039;s borderline:  

Tevatron: Summer 2011 Combined CDF and DØ upper limits on gg→H→W+W- and Constraints on Fourth-Generation Fermion Models with up to 8.2 fb-1 of data. Assuming a heavy sequential fourth generation of fermions, 95% C.L. exclusion for a Higgs boson with mass mH between 124 and 286 GeV/c2.   

CMS (with 1.1 inv fb): The observed CLs-based limits are shown by the solid symbols and black line and exclude the SM4 Higgs with a mass from 120 GeV/c² to 600 GeV/c² (maximum Higgs boson mass covered by the current analyses).  Their bound with 2 inv fb should be better.

ATLAS with something near 2 inv fb: in this model Higgs boson masses above 120 GeV and up to 600 GeV are excluded at the 95% CL.  

So probably you have only the window 115-118 (lower bound from Tevatron, upper bound has to be a bit below 120 or the 120 bound would have gone up to 121 or 122.)  I have not looked at what happens if you roughly combine ATLAS and CMS data by eye... have you?  I would bet the 95% combined bound would now be 118, which would leave at best 115-116, maybe 117 (?)

Clearly 120 is out in this scenario.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Matt,

You said that neither experiment has enough data to have seen a 120 GeV Higgs yet.  However, this is only true for three generations.  If there is a fourth generation, then the production rate is enhanced and could possibly be observed with the current amount of data.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Prof Strassler,

Your candid and very patient sharing of real time stories from &quot;the Physics kitchen&quot;, are nothing less than spectacular and very highly appreciated.

I am a passionate silent reader of your Blog, that strongly disagrees - as I am sure are many many others - with Paolo.

I dearly hope you will get discouraged.

Sincerely,
Yair]]></description>

Paolo,

You are not forced to read this blog if You dont like it; just avoid clicking the corresponding link :-). 
There are  enough people who enjoy and appreciate the amazing amount of work and time Prof. Strassler puts into keeping us all informed and explaining nicely a lot of fascinating things

Cheers]]></description>

I’m not too worried about my credibility. I’ve got plenty of highly-cited scientific papers to back it up. And who are you? What’s your full name?

Besides, I&#039;ve said again and again: this is a &quot;minor discrepancy&quot;; &quot;this will probably go away&quot;; &quot;it must be remembered that small excesses of this type occur regularly in science&quot;.  What more do you want?  I can&#039;t stop people from saying what they want to say, but at least those who actually *read* what I say can understand what I am *not* saying.  You say this is all &quot;about nothing&quot;.  I say this is &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; all about nothing, and I won&#039;t be surprised if it is entirely about nothing, but the small probability that it isn&#039;t about nothing makes it worth a look by theorists.

And as for &quot;abandoning the path&quot;; I&#039;m already done.  I don&#039;t expect to have anything more to say about it until we have results from ATLAS or an update from CMS with much more data... presumably months from now --- unless one of my colleagues makes an interesting observation that merits a comment.]]></description>
