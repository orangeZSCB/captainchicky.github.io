To clarify, eliminating typos, the last paragraph should read:

IMO, If we were to set up a neutrino detector facility on the moon (accounting for a much larger dispersion angle) perhaps we could obtain reliably conclusive timing results for detected neutrinos, since the precise distance to the moon can be experimentally confirmed through laser reflection.  Repeatable results should allow calibration of any gravitational effects.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I very simply argue that any distance estimate used to calulate the speed of neutrinos passing through the Earth, for example, cannot be confirmed.  As a result, neutrinos paths through the Earth&#039;s locally variable gravitational fields are not determinable.  

Since the path and distance actually traversed by neutrinos is not precisely determinable, no conclusive result can be obtained.

In my receding comment I also refer to Wolfgang Kundt argument that the OPERA experiment &quot;is the first experiment to test Einstein’s
theory for the (weak) gravity field of Earth, with the result that the neutrinos
propagated (just) luminally.&quot;

In combination, Kundt argues that the 61 ns discrepancy is an effect of general relativity for precisely timed measurements of gravitational effects, while I simply dismiss any such attempts to precisely determine the distance traversed by neutrinos over such relatively small distances through complex gravitational fields as invalid.

IMO, If we were to set up a neutrino detecter facitiy on the moon (accounting for a much larger dsipersion angle) perhaps we could obtain reliably conclusive timing results for detected neutrinos, since the precise distance to the moon can be experimentally confirmed through laser reflection.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[May be I should elaborate. Perhaps the discrepancy is as a result of a directional motion of the earth that to date we have been unaware of. Assuming the experiment has allowed for  Earth’s rotational speed, orbital speed, solar system rotation and galactic speed then by performing the experiment repeatedly with all this factors accounted for it would be possible to calculate this new speed and directional movement of the Earth.]]></description>
