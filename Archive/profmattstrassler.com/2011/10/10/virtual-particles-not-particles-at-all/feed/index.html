					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/10/10/virtual-particles-not-particles-at-all/#comment-39083&quot;&gt;Lee Hudson&lt;/a&gt;.

Look at Figure 7 in the Virtual Particles article.  If you don&#039;t probe deeply, you&#039;re effectively averaging over a long time period, and you&#039;re not going to see all those complicated happenings inside the electron... they might as well not be there, because your probe can&#039;t interact with them.  If you probe deeply, you are effectively taking a quick snapshot of the electron, and then your probe can potentially interact with those complexities, allowing you to detect them.

Your probe, typically, is another particle --- low-energy or high-energy -- that interacts with the electron you&#039;re probing.  (Note it is not clear who is probing who --- is your particle probing the electron, or is the electron probing your particle?  This is yet another layer of subtlety...)]]></description>

Not exactly;, the simple well-behaved electron &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; what an electron is when viewed by a sufficiently low-energy probe.  It&#039;s not &lt;em&gt;part&lt;/em&gt; of it, unless what you mean by the word &quot;part&quot; includes also the word &quot;whole&quot;.]]></description>

The word &quot;contains&quot; is probably not the best term, I agree.  The virtual objects (which you find when you probe with high-energy and short time and distance) are part of the electron (which behaves simply when you only probe it with low energy and long-distance and time.)]]></description>
