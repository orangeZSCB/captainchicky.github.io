					<description><![CDATA[Since you&#039;re in Japan, I really have to point out the work of Yoshio Koide, who has spent years trying to explain the relationship he discovered between the masses of the charged leptons. It still amazes me that this relationship is so neglected by theorists (outside of Asia, the only well-known theorist I can think of, who gave it any attention, is Ernest Ma), since it&#039;s true to 1 part in 100,000, rather more impressive than ordinary &quot;physics numerology&quot;. I think it must be due to a theoretical prejudice and a methodological preference: the prejudice is that such relationships are only simple at high energy, and the preference is to use the masses of the known particles as input for predicting the masses of superpartners or other new particles. Everyone seems to have adopted an incrementalist philosophy according to which they only seek qualitative explanations (e.g. naturalness) for order-of-magnitude relationships, and actually explaining the masses in detail is an ambition reserved for the distant stringy utopia, when someone manages to guess the right Calabi-Yau. 

Koide&#039;s latest paper came out on the arxiv just a few hours ago. In his &quot;yukawaon&quot; models, each particle gets its mass, not from a Higgs coupling, but from the VEV of a distinct scalar, so it&#039;s as if each particle has its own Higgs. My own interest is in whether you can get the necessary scalars from something like N=8 supergravity, or from the numerous moduli of a string compactification. In any case, I commend the paper to your attention. :-)]]></description>

Have fun at the celebrations :-)]]></description>
