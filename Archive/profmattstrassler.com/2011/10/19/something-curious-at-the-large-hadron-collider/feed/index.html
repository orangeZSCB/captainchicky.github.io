					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/10/19/something-curious-at-the-large-hadron-collider/#comment-1449&quot;&gt;Matt Strassler&lt;/a&gt;.

Well, I was thinking in a different scenary, no MSSM nor extensions, but SSM. By SSM I mean simply to ask every known particle to be in a N=1 supermultiplet, but keep agnostic about the higgs mechanism. Then you have still wino and zino, an three scalars from the massive N=1 supermultiplets, but no more. This susy scenario is probably more difficult to discover that the standard one with five scalars and more neutralinos. (And my own model is even more stingier, because I think I can dispose of all the scalars)]]></description>
