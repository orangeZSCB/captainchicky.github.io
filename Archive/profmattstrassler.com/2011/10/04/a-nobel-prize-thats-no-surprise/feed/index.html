					<description><![CDATA[You really make it seem so easy with your presentation but I find this matter to be actually something that I think I would never understand.
It seems too complicated and extremely broad for me.
I am looking forward for your next post, I&#039;ll try to get the hang of it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey this is kind of of off topic but I was wanting 
to know if blogs use WYSIWYG editors or if you have to manually 
code with HTML. I&#039;m starting a blog soon but have no 
coding expertise so I wanted to get advice from someone with experience.
Any help would be greatly appreciated!]]></description>
