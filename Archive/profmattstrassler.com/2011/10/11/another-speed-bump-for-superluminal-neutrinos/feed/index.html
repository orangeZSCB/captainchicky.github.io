					<description><![CDATA[Havve you ever thouyht abbout including a little bit more than just your articles?
I mean, whjat you say is valuagle and all. Nevertheless just 
imagine if you added somme great graphics or video clips too give our posts more, &quot;pop&quot;!
Yoour content is excellent bbut with images and clips,
this website could definitely be one of the greatest in itts field.

Amazing blog!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think the reason is simple. 
The problem is the &quot;Base system&quot;. Who knows which is at speed Zero.
When there is a superposed movement due to any unnown effect the real distance is shorter an the calculated speed is to high. When there is something faster than light, that there is no reason the speed is so close to light speed.
 
The experiment should be done in two exatly opposit directions, the speed is the average for both experiments.]]></description>

Right: there&#039;s this terminological problem.  What you&#039;re asking is this: if Einstein is right and there is an ultimate speed limit, does light travel at the speed limit or just below?  This is where articles like the Cohen-Glashow argument (following other work of Coleman and Glashow) step in to show you that there&#039;s not a lot of room for that sort of modification of relativity.  See my article on Cohen-Glashow: https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/10/06/is-the-opera-speedy-neutrino-experiment-self-contradictory/]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m wondering if we are completely sure that light goes at exactly &quot;c&quot;.

Could it be that c is just a teensy bit faster than light-speed, giving neutrinos the option of going slightly faster than light, but stil slower than c?

I know we can measure light speed to like 12 decimal places, but can we be totally sure this is the same as c?

Could not light be being slowed down a trice by stuff we can&#039;t see..... Like the neutrino background?     

Just random musings Fromm a geek with only 4 semesters of Physics.]]></description>

You don&#039;t want to use the term &quot;density of gravity&quot; here, but you do mean, I think, the strength of the gravitational field in your vicinity.  And it isn&#039;t just a &lt;em&gt;perception&lt;/em&gt; of time; how time itself evolves is dependent on the gravitational field. Time does not flow uniformly.  It flows differently at the earth&#039;s surface than it does 1000&#039;s of miles up, where the gravitational field of the earth is weaker, and the GPS system has to correct for this effect in order for it to work.  (Every time you use a GPS device to get somewhere you test Einstein&#039;s theory!)  However... that effect is taken into account in the OPERA experiment.]]></description>
