Hmm.  This whole business hasn&#039;t necessarily got anything to do with supersymmetry, or with dark matter.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It is worth noting that astronomy data relating to large scale structure (under the general rubric of warm dark matter studies) and direct detection efforts for dark matter, are not a good fit to a dark matter particle in the three digit and up GeV mass range.  The large scale structure data favors something on the order of the keV mass range; the direct detection efforts that claim any signal (and they are mutually inconsistent in the simplest of dark matter models) point to something in the single digit GeV mass range.  

So, if SUSY is out there, there is some evidence entirely separate from particle collider evidence to favor a R-parity violating model over one that conserves R-parity.]]></description>

Thanks a lot for pointing out the earlier articles.  It&#039;s just pure chance that I learned about this from van der Bij, and Patt and Wilczek.  If I can use this I&#039;ll try to check out the history and make sure the earlier papers are cited, including yours.]]></description>

Dear Prof. Strassler,

Ok thanks for this clarification so far :-)

I think a similar nice article like the one about the state of SUSY is badly needed for the extra dimensions too; clarifying the details You mention and saying what sort of models are excluded and what (with a small propability I think?) could still be &quot;in force&quot;

I just remember for example a certain well known blog scornfully cheering each incoming exlusion result concerning extra dimensions too (in addition to SUSY)  earlier this year :-/ ...

So a clear voice of reason concerning the state of different types of extra dimensions is needed again ;-)]]></description>

The mixing you refer to was suggested yet earlier by Schabinger and Wells; and earlier than that by any number of authors in various contexts.  And I pointed it out (following on Schabinger and Wells) in my much more general paper with Zurek, hep-ph/0604261, previous to Patt and Wilczek.  I don&#039;t understand why people are so insistent on crediting these papers that you mention.]]></description>
