					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/12/04/why-10-years-to-be-sure-theres-no-higgs-particles/#comment-2875&quot;&gt;Francesco turci&lt;/a&gt;.

GREAT question!  Wow. So much to say.

First, Occam&#039;s razor is great when you have two sets of equations that describe the same phenomenon (e.g. Ptolemy&#039;s cosmology vs. Copernicus/Kepler/Newtonian cosmology) and you want to decide which of the two to use.  It has a bad record when predicting whether new phenomena will be present in nature or not.  Its record in particle physics is particularly disappointing, as it would have led you incorrectly not to expect the muon particle, parity violation, the Z particle, masses for neutrinos, dark energy, and a host of other phenomena without which the world would be a much simpler place.  So we have to be very careful.  If we discover the Higgs particle and ten theories try to explain its features, we may want to pick the simplest one, along Occam&#039;s lines.  But if, come 2013, we are trying to figure out why we&#039;re having trouble discovering it, that may not be the right way to go.

Second, you must not confuse (and I, as an author, must try harder not to confuse you) the complexity of a Higgs variant with the difficulty of discovering it.  As I always emphasize to students, a very simple Higgs variant can be vastly more difficult to discover than the simple vanilla Standard Model Higgs particle.  (In fact I precisely emphasized this in the first 20 minutes of my June 18, 2010 lecture recorded at http://physicslearning2.colorado.edu/tasi/tasi_2010/tasi_2010.htm )  Manwhile, there are complicated Higgs variants that are actually easier to find, and would already have been discovered by now.  How long it takes to find the Higgs has to do, obviously, with how complex the search strategy is, not how complicated is the theory that predicts it.  And it is hard to justify applying Occam&#039;s razor to an experimental search strategy!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear prof. Strassler, is there any upper bound in the degree of complexity of the Higgs variants and the difficulty of measurability of such variants? I mean, for any physical phenomena we can always look for a more rich, sophisticated and complex model that seems to better fit some aspects of the phenomenon, but we usually apply a simplicity principle in physics, and focus the research consequently: is there any Occam razor for the different theories embedding some kind of Higgs particle?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I do agree with you on this 10-year time frame. But, it is not demanded by the science but by the human psychic.

The principle of least action goes way beyond physics and mathematics, and it applies to all areas. When a new manufacturing process is invented (such as Nature did for itself), it could be quite rudimentary, and it goes through a fine tuning process to reach the “least action” steady state. In this process, it can appear a bifurcation state, that is, it gets more complicated by adding a lot of bells and whistles. But, this bifurcation will converge to the final end, the least action steady state.

With analogy of the most advanced “Wash machine” which consists of the following sub-systems.
1. the hard-core wash machine, without any bells and whistles.
2. a robot system to gather the dirty clothes from all rooms, with a dirty sniffing subsystem.
3. a color sorting system
4. etc.
However exotic this system is, we will always find the debris of the hard-cord wash machine when it is bombed into pieces.

At LHC, we are not trying to find out what are inside of protons. The p-p collision acts as bomb to break up the neighborhood spacetime sheet and to see what are hiding in it. If our bomb energy (the p-p collision) is not big enough to crack the exotic Higgs, then it is an all different story. If the energy is big enough, then we can always see the debris of the hard-cord Higgs (without the exotic-ness) even if it were no longer a standalone entity in the current state of universe evolution.

Thus, if we did not see a hard-cord Higgs now, there is a little chance for seeing an exotic Higgs according to this principle of least action. However, in human psychic, we demand the last evidence from the last hole. Then, 10 years might still not be enough.]]></description>
