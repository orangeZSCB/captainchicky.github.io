Dear Prof. Strassler,

as every independent observer from the outside can see from the comment section below Your newer post &quot;Theory / Experiment Discussion at CERN about Higgs&quot; for example, it is Mr. Peter Woit (why do You belief everything this gentleman says?) who repetedly and persistenly tries to force You into an ugly discussion and NOT Your old friend Prof. Kane. What Prof. Kane says or discusses at other places in the internet, chat boxes, etc, has not automatically to be Your business if You dont want it.

Just to say and put certain things straight ...
Cheers]]></description>

Yes, but what are the sigmas based upon: i e what is the null hypothesis in this current observation? Is it = The Higgs does exist, but elsewhere than here (this GeV range)?

Is the Higgs assumed to exist?]]></description>

It&#039;s well known what I think of Gordy&#039;s claim, but it might be a good idea if HEP theorists in general express publicly an opinion about it. He&#039;s going on a publicity campaign for this, including another such live chat at Science magazine tomorrow.]]></description>

As you and Tommaso both said, Peter, it depends what you ask.  I was asking whether the data presented constituted strong evidence.  If instead you ask people if they think they have found it, they say that there&#039;s a good chance of it --- but that the evidence is still very slim.  And certainly not &quot;firm&quot;.

Personally I think there is quite a decent chance that they have found it.  I can make a strong argument in its favor.  I can also see places where I can pull on a loose end and the whole thing unravels.

As for Gordy -- do you, of all people, really think he can calculate the Higgs mass from string theory?  If not, why did you mention it?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Matt,

You might want to take a look at the live chat at Nature, involving Gordon Kane and Bill Murray (of ATLAS).

http://www.nature.com/news/live-qa-the-hunt-for-the-higgs-1.9642

Murray says: &quot; We have no proof, but I polled 10 tof the leaders of the ATLAS search and my wife last night if they thought we had found it and they ALL said yes. But that is not proof, it could be over-excitement.&quot;

Kane says: &quot;for a higgs to be meaningful it must be part of a supersymmetric theory&quot;

&quot;Recently we have published string theory calculations that imply the higgs boson mass is 125 GeV so if it is there are strong implications for connecting string theory to the real world, and for what the higgs discovery implies. we did that before the data.&quot;

&quot;string theories are now well enough understood to predict higgs physics,&quot;]]></description>
