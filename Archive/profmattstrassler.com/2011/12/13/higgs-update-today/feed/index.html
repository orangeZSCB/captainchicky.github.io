					<description><![CDATA[To add some reasons to think that Tommaso could be right, let me also add that Bill Murray polled 10 &quot;leaders&quot; of the ATLAS search: did you find the Higgs? 10 out of 10 said Yes. See the live chat at Nature:

http://www.nature.com/news/live-qa-the-hunt-for-the-higgs-1.9642

The other participant in the Nature live blog above was Gordon Kane. In another live chat where he participated, one organized by Science, he was so sure that he even overestimated the combined ATLAS+CMS significance level to be 5 sigma, well, it&#039;s around 4 sigma, but the qualitative message is the same:

http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2011/12/live-chat-the-higgs-boson-at-las.html

Yes, Roser was skeptical and on the 1-10 scale, he said &quot;I am a 1&quot;, i.e. almost totally uncertain whether they found it. His being at the Tevatron could arguably be correlated with this downbeat message about the LHC. Still, I am convinced that most HEP physicists think that the likelihood that the signal near 125+-2 is real is way above 50% and closer to 100%. I don&#039;t attribute importance to these polls but Matt&#039;s sociological reports seem implausible to me.

To join a theme of Tommaso, I must correct a mistake. I didn&#039;t mean Gordy Kane. I meant the Victor Weisskopf Distinguished University Professor of Physics and Director Emeritus, MCTP Gordon Kane. :-)

BTW yes, it&#039;s one of the first episodes when I think that the media&#039;s response to the events was pretty much totally accurate. Maybe the PR folks at CERN have contributed to this outcome, too.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/12/13/higgs-update-today/#comment-3360&quot;&gt;Gnart&lt;/a&gt;.

Good point Matt.  For H&#062;gg, looks like ATLAS has 9 subsamples and CMS has 4, and they make limits for each subsample and then combine.   The heteroschedasticity and variety of background levels supports they way they did it.

It would be interesting to know whether any particular subsample is providing an unexpected portion of the `hint&#039;, and if that subsample is expected to be more sensitive one (or less sensitive one).  ATLAS does look a little odd IMO on this point.  But the collaborations would have to `do it right&#039;.

Both collaborations did combine all 9(ATLAS)/4(CMS) subsamples in one grand histogram per collaboration, though.... so they diluted their own apparent sensitivity in a way, but I guess just for PR.]]></description>

You are *so* transparent, Tommaso.  Being on a limb now has nothing whatsoever as to whether it turns out there is a Higgs there or not.  You made a 50-50 guess; you cannot take credit for being smart just because you turn out lucky.]]></description>
