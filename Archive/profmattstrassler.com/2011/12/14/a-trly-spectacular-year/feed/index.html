I think, theoretical physics at the MPI in München is not that bad ;-) ... :

They are quite cool :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@ Mark: Sure, Germany has some good people not doing multi loop calculations. But compare their creativity and influence to their American (ie working in the US) colleagues. If you want some names, how about Weinberg, Arkani-Hamed, Maldacena, Susskind, Witten... Who came up with extra dimensions, technicolor, little higgs, susy etc? For me, the most influential German hep-ph/hep-th physicist (working in Germany in the last 3 decades) in terms of creativity was Julius Wess.
Anyways, my point was to have a healthy mix!
Matt&#039;s unfair but realistic description of &quot;theoretical physicists that you never hear about&quot; just reminded me of this issue, and I believe that the communities in the US or in Germany should be aware of this and discuss it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;The theoretical physicists that you never hear about — the ones who are actually useful and who work and sweat tirelessly on very difficult technical problems&quot; would have been a better introduction to that paragraph...
There is something wrong in this system where (at least on this side of the Atlantic) theorists doing hard, useful calculations are not getting jobs and nobody ever hears about them. How many model builders does one need? The other extreme may be Germany, which is firmly in the hand of the multi-loop/multi-leg mafia and where much less speculative or creative work is done by theorists (nowadays, I should add! before WW2 Germany certainly had the crazy model builders, whose models even turned out to be right). How about a healthy mix?!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice post. You should take a bow yourself for your excellent blog. I&#039;ve learned a lot here. Here&#039;s a half-humerous question: When will it be appropriate to replace the theoretical Higgs detection pictured on your front page with one of the real ones? Happy holidays.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It has been an excellent year, and all involved deserve an applause. By achieving  5 inverse femtobarns at 7 TeV within relatively short period - it took Fermilab about 4 years to achieve (1 fb) -1, shows that LHC and detectors are working exceptionally well. I overheard Fabiola saying it may require up to 20/fb  of data to arrive at confirming Higgs if it is there at or around 125 GeV. Exciting period to be in experimental physics, for sure, with the world of wonders to come in the future...]]></description>
