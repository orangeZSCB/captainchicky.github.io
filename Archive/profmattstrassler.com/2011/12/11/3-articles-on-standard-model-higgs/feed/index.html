Earl - you are right that what I wrote was confusing.  I mean that if we had traveled at normal air speed instead of the &lt;strong&gt;slower&lt;/strong&gt; speed that the pilots chose, in order to make our arrival at a reasonable hour.  So yes, your interpretation is right.  And I think David overestimated the usual length of the trip; the flight time is shorter than that.  [Maybe there&#039;s a cushion built in for air traffic issues at Newark?]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[David, I went back and read Matt&#039;s post. Gotcha. Thanks for taking the time with me. I&#039;m a classicist, not a physicist, so anything that involves comparing two numbers relative to each other is always going to confuse me!]]></description>

The tail winds (the speed of the air with respect to the ground) don&#039;t affect the air speed (the speed of the plane with respect to the air).  Due to the extraordinary tail winds (the speed of the air with respect to the ground), &lt;b&gt;normal&lt;/b&gt; air speed (of the plane with respect to the air) would have resulted in an abnormal ground speed (of the plane with respect to the ground), and thus a shorter trip, as Matt states.  This is a great illustration of the point in the linked article, that the speed of something (plane or air) always has to be stated as relative to something else (air or ground).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[David, I got that. But Matt mentioned the ground speed in his original article, I was just confused about his final sentence &quot;At normal air speed we apparently would have made the trip in less than 5 1/2 hours!&quot;. Normal, would, I think, be without the &quot;extraordinary&quot; 200 mph tail winds. You just posted that normal air speed means a trip of almost eight hours. I think Matt meant to say (maybe) that at the abnormal speed they were traveling, the trip would have taken 5 1/2 hours, but the crew slowed down the plane so they would arrive after the custom officials started their jobs.]]></description>
