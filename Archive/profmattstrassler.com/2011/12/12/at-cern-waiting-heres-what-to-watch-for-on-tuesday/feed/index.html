					<description><![CDATA[An impressive share, I just given this onto 
a colleague who was doing a bit of analysis on this.
And he in fact purchased me breakfast because I discovered it for him.
. smile. So let me reword that: Thnx for the treat!

But yeah Thnkx for spending the time to discuss this, I really feel strongly 
about it and love studying extra on this topic. If doable, as you develop 
into expertise, would you mind updating your blog with 
extra particulars? It is extremely helpful for 
me. Big thumb up for this blog post!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have been reading since you came and gave a talk at McGill.  As a condensed matter physicist, I don&#039;t always find the time to follow all this stuff and I find your blog very convenient.

In short, thanks for that and keep up the good work.

					<description><![CDATA[Its really good to see all the caviats above. I think the whole section is better than some other articles jumping to conclusions. The CERN teams will of course play it both ways. On the one hand they will emphasize caution, on the other hand there will be talk of possibly the most important discovery in physics for the last 50 years.  Experimentally a signal in the gam/gam channel is not good enough. The WW is about as sensitive in that region (slightly more by my calcs) and we should see an accompanying &#039;hump&#039; in the WW with a best fit to 125GeV (just as we &#039;saw&#039; at 140 GeV 4 months ago, when I was emphasizing the absence of an accompanying, but less significant, &#039;hump&#039; in the gam/gam channel).

Experimentally, I am sceptical of the Higgs being found in the last bastion left to it, where (by definition) the experiment is least sensitive. Theoretically, I find the whole idea of a single particle giving mass to everything (via an ad hoc potential) a bit to simplistic - a kind of a nirvana. Many are often quoted as saying they put forward the Higgs scenario only as a simple of how mass can be generated preserving renormalizability, and manifest symmetries. Reality is more complex.]]></description>
