					<description><![CDATA[I usually avoid blogs, but I have a passing familiarity with this measurement, and I think some points need to be emphasized.

First is that the experiments could have said &quot;We think this is the Higgs&quot;.  They chose not to.  If you look at Matt&#039;s posting on the Chi_b(3P) today, it tells us that the experiments are not afraid to announce a discovery, provided they believe the case is solid.  

Second, it is hard to underepmhaisze how fast this turnaround is.  Run II of the Tevatron began on March 1st, 2001.  Their first paper was submitted on July 29th, 2003.  The 2011 LHC proton run ended on October 30th.  That leaves ten weeks for the data to be reconstructed, calibrated and aligned, analyzed, compared with Monte Carlo, cross-checked and discussed.  I get the feeling that people think that once the data is collected the experiments have their answer.  Nothing could be further from the truth - it takes hundreds of people to ensure that by the time they make their final plots, the data, calibration and analysis is all understood and can be trusted.

In a related point, the experiments continue to make progress in calibration, alignment and analysis.  These improvements will mean there will be events that are in the plot that will move out, events that are out of the plots that will move in, and events that stay in may move to somewhat different masses.  With a robust signal, on average this will improve things.  With a small number of events, tiny changes in where and how many the events are can make substantial changes to the significance.  

If I paraphrase the argument as follows: &quot;ATLAS has a large excess (indeed, larger than one would expect from a SM Higgs, by about a factor of 2), and while not convincing in and of itself, just look at all the statistically marginal effects in the exact same spot.  What are the chances of that?&quot;   The odds of the statistically marginal effects moving around may be higher than you think.  We don&#039;t know, and won&#039;t know until the experiments apply the latest calibrations, but it would not surprise anyone on the experimental side to see substantial effects in the significance plots from these small changes to the analysis.  Anyone in this field long enough has seen this happen time and again.  This is part of what &quot;Preliminary&quot; means.  

To stretch an analogy, just as nine women can&#039;t have a baby in one month, you can&#039;t make a significant and credible peak by combining a lot of marginal ones.  And, like the baby, you can&#039;t rush things - it will take time for the final calibrations to be done, it will take time for all the channels to be included, it will take time for a proper combination between both experiments to be done, and in all probability it will take more data.  We know how much data on average it should take for a discovery in this mass region, and it&#039;s quite a bit more than what&#039;s been collected.

Third, Matt is absolutely right that one should distinguish between evidence and expectation.  

And finally, one needs to remember what a &quot;sigma&quot; it is.  It is a measure of how consistent one&#039;s data is with the null hypothesis, which in this case is &quot;there is no Higgs, only a background that is perfectly predicted by theory and perfectly simulated in our software&quot;. Statistically rejecting the null hypothesis is a necessary but not sufficient condition for discovery, and the question &quot;how many sigmas&quot; is only part of the story.

Give it time.  By 2012 we will have a much clearer picture of what is going on.  We&#039;ve waited more than 30 years, a few more months or a year won&#039;t kill us.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your reply.
Conformal invariance may be already broken by gravity, but I don&#039;t see how this scenario relates to the Higgs mechanism, as long as we don&#039;t clearly understand the relationship between Higgs and gravity. 
I am afraid I disagree with your optimistic assessment that &quot;...knowing the mass (and other properties) of the Higgs particle is a crucial ingredient that may make it a lot easier down the road to figure these things out.&quot; 
This clearly remains to be seen. Although I don&#039;t have definitive proof to back up my view, the puzzles I mentioned seem to indicate much serious problems at the foundational level.

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/12/19/has-lhc-found-the-higgs-good-reasons-foragainst-confidence/#comment-3848&quot;&gt;Ervin Goldfain&lt;/a&gt;.

vacuum: for the Standard Model, or for supersymmetry, 125 GeV is fine, as far as I understand; if the previous results you&#039;ve seen in the literature make you nervous, my understanding is that more detailed calculations are fine with 125, and don&#039;t forget there is dark matter in the world and any coupling to it by the Higgs field may change the calculation.

fine-tuning: if all we have is the Standard Model along with a 125 GeV Higgs, the fine-tuning problem remains very confusing (unless you claim it is a selection effect, which it might be.)  if there are other new elementary particles to be found in LHC data, then the answer depends on what they are.

cosmological constant: the cosmological constant problem is not addressed here -- again, it may be a selection effect.  many people try to tie together the cosmological selection effect with a possible selection effect on the Higgs, but we know far too little about nature to do that with confidence

gauge hierarchy: this is just the fine-tuning problem, restated

#generations: 125 GeV Higgs adds no information by itself; we need more information from the LHC or elsewhere

CP violation in weak nuclear interactions and CP preservation in strong nuclear interactions: same as previous

neutrino masses/mixings:  same as previous

And your last question:
 conformal invariance is already broken by gravity, so any conformal invariance that the Higgs mass term breaks is accidental anyway --- in other words, there was no problem here to start with.  In fact the right way to understand your last question is as a yet another restatement of the fine-tuning problem. 

All of this is to say: if we want to understand all the puzzles facing particle physics, just finding a 125 GeV Higgs isn&#039;t going to do the job by itself.  But knowing the mass (and other properties) of the Higgs particle is a crucial ingredient that may make it a lot easier down the road to figure these things out.]]></description>

Chris -- thanks for your careful reply.  One does have to be careful here.  That&#039;s all I&#039;m trying to say.

One point I think that isn&#039;t emphasized enough is that if one is willing to accept photon peaks at 123 and 126 as being at the same location, then what one is really saying is this: given that ATLAS sees something at 126, we would accept CMS seeing anything between 123 and 129 as being coincident.  (Let&#039;s leave out CMS ZZ* because it is simply too ambiguous right now.)  Now that is a 6 GeV subwindow out of a 26 GeV window (115 to 141) that was left after the last measurement.  AND CMS has &lt;strong&gt;two&lt;/strong&gt; 2-sigma bumps within the region -- which they say had a bit below 20% probability.  So the probability that one of the CMS bumps would line up with the ATLAS bump -- if you are going to be that loose with the allowed agreement --- is not as low as you would think.

Again, this is not to say that the degree of concordance is inconsistent with a Higgs boson -- far from it.  But one really has to be careful about over-stating the evidence in favor of a signal --- and even more, about inserting one&#039;s belief into the evidence and using it to boost the evidence itself, rather than allowing it merely to increase one&#039;s confidence that the weak evidence supports one&#039;s belief.]]></description>

Dear Lubos and Matt,

thank you for your replies and sorry for not being clear enough. What I meant was exactly that the energy resolution is not good enough to really declare the bump in the 123-127 GeV region to be split up into two or more in any statistically significant way.

In fact, the 3 ATLAS 4-lepton events, the clearest individual signal i believe, is at the upper edge of the expected SM cross section. For the overall consistency of the signal with a SM Higgs it is a &quot;good thing&quot; that the peak location does not so exactly overlap with the other channels, because if it did, the Higgs cross section might start disagreeing with the SM (too large). But again, all this is trying to get information from sub-1-sigma effects or slightly over 1-sigma effects.

So far for the part where i agree with Lubos. Now on a slightly broader picture i think that Matt also has a point. If one focuses on the narrow region around 125GeV there really is a sizeable excess. But if you look at total event counts over a somewhat broader region then there is no excess. in the 4l channel, the 3 events are so striking because there are no background events close in energy. Also in the ATLAS gamma-gama channel you see a slight blip on top of a smooth curve around 125GeV. But you do see a similar one at around 100GeV, too. So with a little less confidence in the absence of observer bias, it might very well be that the signal will collapse with more data. But to be honest, this is pretty much what the collaborations officially claimed.]]></description>
