					<description><![CDATA[Stony Brook as a location for a university is kind of the worst of both worlds. It&#039;s not New York City, but it&#039;s close enough to a huge population of people who already have lives close by, and aren&#039;t that interested in starting a new life in Stony Brook. If we were in New York City, we&#039;d still have a lot of people from close by, but people would want to stay in the city, because... well it&#039;s the city. If we were upstate, almost everyone would be cut off from their old lives and would actually be making a new life at Stony Brook.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yes, one can &quot;extract&quot; the right result, especially if one knows it in advance. I, however, do not think it is fantastic. I designed a simple demonstration of how we make mistake while coupling and how we get the right result due to renormalizaton. http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.3702  Enjoy!]]></description>

If you can&#039;t measure it, even in principle, it probably doesn&#039;t make sense to say it exists.  Experience has shown that if you try to make sense of things that you can&#039;t measure, and you try to calculate their properties, the result is (a) infinity, or (b) ambiguous, or (c) nonsensical.  The fantastic thing about quantum field theory is that it gives sensible answers for all physically-meaningful questions, even though it gives insane answers for lots of other questions you might try to ask.  There are infinities, ambiguities, and bizarre behaviors all over the place -- but when you ask a good question, you get a good answer.]]></description>
