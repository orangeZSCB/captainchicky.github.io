The neutrino hits a quark or an antiquark inside a proton or neutron.  Or in some cases it may hit an electron.  This &quot;hitting&quot; is an effect of the weak nuclear force, in the same sense that when two electrons &quot;hit&quot; (or &quot;scatter off&quot;) each other it is due to the electromagnetic force.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[at the Fermilab today site, Joshua Spitz of ArgoNeuT repeats the mantra you cite above nearly verbatim.. He is not identified but I wonder how the press can be bludgeoned over the head with this when the science community itself is lazy with the whole mattter. His article is What happens when a neutrino hits something.   As an addendum, what exactly does the neutrino hit ,  the nucleus , an individual proton or neutron or perhaps a tiny little science reporter just waiting to write how Einstein has been proved wrong ?]]></description>
