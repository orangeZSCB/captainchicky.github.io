I think it is more complex than that.  January 1 was set by the Romans, long before the date of Christmas was set.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Brilliant article - thank you!

Just a small point on why Christmas is not on 1st of January. The date was chosen arbitrarily but why there is a six day gap? After all the calendar suppose to start with the birth of Jesus. In Russian orthodox church and I believe in Catholic too the 1st of January is marked as &quot;Circumcision of our God&quot;, in those days a man was not a man until he was circumcised on the seventh day.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[ThereÂ´s another catch in giving significance to 11/11/11 when the year is actually 2011 and we shorten it to 11 just for convenience. There already was a 11/11/1111 and the world didn&#039;t end there.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Eh.. celebrating drunkenness is not so good, it just accelerates brain decay, taxes the liver and makes us more likely to get killed. There are better ways to enter altered states.. ;) I celebrated 11/11/11 at the Dallas Meditation Center.. and yes, they were very pointed about the fact that it is only a symbolism and actually no more special than any other day, just another reason to gather and meditate on peace and consciousness.]]></description>
