					<description><![CDATA[Matt,

One question I have is if this new information has indeed undermined all of the theories of eternal inflation, which seemed to be implied by a post over at the Starts with a Bang blog (https://medium.com/starts-with-a-bang/ask-ethan-74-gravitational-waves-c21e701f9bde).

If that were true I would think it would be pretty big news considering the prominent cosmologists who have been proposing it over the years. Your thoughts would be greatly appreciated.]]></description>

The LHC is already in supersymmetry territory and has been knocking back theories for a while. At its new energy it will probe further into possibly supersymmetric particles (Such as selectrons.) as well as look for dark matter particles and things like axions. At this point the LHC will basically look for everything. (Though neutrinos of any kind are always very tricky to pin down.)]]></description>

The paper in the article is an attempt to quantify how reliant on quantum effects various things are. It&#039;s little more than an attempt way to organize things on a scale of &#039;quantum&#039; In the case of the Robin its detection of magnetic fields is theorized to be completely reliant on quantum effects.

The paper is... interesting but doesn&#039;t really add anything new. It could even hinder research by labeling various approaches as unimportant.]]></description>

The above analysis of avian reception presents a pic-
ture of an array of quantum meters located in the retina
of the bird, each of which measures the magnitude and
orientation of the magnetic field relative to its own ori-
entation and produces a classical signal in the form of a
chemical population derived from the integrated time de-
pendence of the protonated radical pair population.
SO IT HAS A SUB-ATOMIC QUANTUM COMPASS?
 One of the underlying assumptions in radical-pair-based mag-
neto reception is that the bird’s brain undertakes process-
ing and integration of all such classical signals deriving
from an array of quantum meters]: it thus generates
visual modulation patterns via chemical signaling of the
intrinsically quantum protonated state yield.It is these variations in the modulation patterns that yield the de-sired magnetic field information ].
THE BRAIN OF THE BIRD PROCESSES THE SIGNALS AND THANKS 
TO A NUMBER OF QUANTUM EVENTS IT GETS A VISUAL MAP?
An interesting aspect of this biological quantum measurement is that it
is continuous in time, with the cumulative protonated-
state population providing the calibration for the classi-
cal field.
THE PROCESS IS SPONTANEOUS?

Is that what you are saying Margot?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A large class of chemical reactions or biological processes may be described as a quan- tum measurement where the biological complex of interest assumes the role of a quantum meter
*************************************************************************************
Even though a quantum measurement is normally per-
ceived as interfacing a system with a classical apparatus,
it is convenient to describe the underlying physical pro-
cess as a quantum mechanical interaction between the
system to be measured and a quantum meter; as a con-
sequence of the interaction  the system and the meter become correlated in a way that the post-measurement state of the meter carries
information about the system state. The irreversibility of
the measurement process emerges as a consequence of the
coupling of the quantum meter to other physical systems
with large number of degrees of freedom { the environ-
ment of the quantum meter}. This formulation was first
introduced by von Neumann in 1930s.

Based on this premise, a large class of chemical reac-
tions or biological processes can be described as a quan-
tum measurement where the biological complex of inter-
est assumes the role of a quantum meter. The simplest
scenario with which one can describe a quantum mea-
surement is the one in which the wave-function describ-
ing the quantum meter is in a pure state - which is nor-
mally the lowest energy eigenstate of the meter Hamil-
tonian Hmeter. This assumption does not require that
the overall system wave-function is in a pure state - nor
does it assume zero temperature; it is motivated by the
fact that to ensure maximal information extraction from
the system that is being measured, it is desirable to have
complete information about the initial state of the meter.
That said, the assumption of an initial pure-state is well
justified in a pigment-protein complex where the initial
in particular, measurement of an incident radiation field
and of the earth&#039;s magnetic field.
We assume that the broadband optical excitation projects the quantum
meter into a superposition of eigenstates with eigenenergies that
are substantially higher than that of the initial ground
state of the meter.

Measurement of an external field by a biological quantum meter described
above. We shall illustrate this with specific reference to
the cryptochrome protein, a photoreceptor which is the
leading candidate for hosting the radical pair in the retina
of birds. This protein contains a co-factor, FAD, which
absorbs incident light centered around 450 nm to form an
excited singlet state FAD . The unstable FAD  triggers
a rapid charge transfer across a chain of three trypto-
phan amino acids, leading to the formation of a radical
pair state [FAD 􀀀 + TrpH +] in which the electron spins
are located on spatially separated and distinct molecules.
The total electron spin is conserved during this fast elec-
tron transfer, which takes place on a ps time-scale  0.

On the other hand, we note that optically induced radical
pairs are also sensitive to weak electric elds; this sensi-
tivity is due to the different electric dipole moments of
the singlet and triplet states, which in turn results in an
external electric field dependent relative phase between
the two spin states. As a consequence, the singlet-triplet
oscillations in the excited state can be altered by external
electric fields. In fact, it is well known that fluctuating
electric fields can lead to dephasing of singlet-triplet co-
herence. Taken alone, such dephasing is equivalent
to a non-referred quantum measurement of the electric
field. However, in the context of an optically induced
radical pair in a biological setting with chemical reaction
products dependent on the singlet-triplet dynamics, the
underlying electric field sensitivity of the singlet-triplet
energy difference may facilitate measurement of a local
electric field.]]></description>
