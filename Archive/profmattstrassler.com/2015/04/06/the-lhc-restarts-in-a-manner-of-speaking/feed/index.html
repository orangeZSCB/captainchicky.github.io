					<description><![CDATA[I wonder if anyone else but me has thoughts of vacuum being somehow matter-like vacuum energy substance, substitute for matter exist.

Thus the energy of vacuum flow for the energy of matter. Dark energy could be dipole energy of vacuum energy used by matter. And dark mass, not matter, could be perturbances of vacuum energy field because of flowing energy units under causality balanced in geometry of gravitational dynamical changes.

Something like that - any familiar?]]></description>

Oh there are so many options. The most popular aside from particles is simply gravity not working how we think it does. (See MOND and TeVeS theories.) They&#039;re not favorites but you never know.]]></description>

No, it cannot and I do not agree. Virtual particles are everywhere. This means ALL fields are everywhere (That we know of.) Weak, strong, electron, gravity... gravity is not something special in that sense.

For a force to be infinite in range its virtual particles need to be indefinitely stable, that is, the theoretical lowest energy virtual particle needs to have no energy. Remember, a big point about such particles is the more energy they have the shorter their lifetime.

There is a big problem with the &#039;energy&#039; of virtual particles as a whole; when you add up what it &#039;should&#039; be you get a massive, MASSIVE result, enough to crush the universe into nothing in a second. The actual vacuum energy is far smaller. What&#039;s the deal? Nobody knows yet but it seems that you can&#039;t just &#039;add up&#039; virtual particles and you definitely can&#039;t say how much energy they contribute, not until we start getting some sensible results.]]></description>

Matt, &quot;Yes, we know,&quot; was a bit cryptic, and I am not sure what it refers to. If it refers to the neutral electron, and since you are doing more posts on dark matter, I would really appreciate it if you could expand.

I am sorry if the part about Heim is not true; all I know is what is on the web and I tried to state that truthfully. If there is an error, again I would appreciate knowing what the truth is.]]></description>
