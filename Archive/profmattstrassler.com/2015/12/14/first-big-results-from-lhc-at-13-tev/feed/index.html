					<description><![CDATA[With a &quot;high spin or a large amount of color&quot;!  This is tempting to me because it hints at some generalized knowledge that I can&#039;t yet string together.  Why would we specifically see results in this area as opposed to particles with low spin / low color?  I&#039;m guessing color because we&#039;re specifically testing QCD principles.  But why spin?  And THANK YOU for the update, Matt!]]></description>

To my knowledge it was Einstein who understood that the FitzGerald-Lorentz contraction hypothesis was to be interpreted not as a contraction of objects but as a contraction of space itself (and with a corresponding expansion of time) as viewed by a observer relative to which the objects are moving.-- Physicist Matthew Strassler. ??]]></description>

...rhythm...
QED has a flat stage called spacetime to dance with rhythm.
But QCD has curled space, could not dance with rhythm ?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I’d like to second that, it is great to have you back! Professor,

 /The top quark is the known particle with the largest rest mass; its mass-energy (E=mc² energy) of 175 GeV = 0.175 TeV.
QCD itself is associated with the rest mass scale of the proton, with mass-energy of about 1 GeV, again essentially zero from the TeV point of view. Quarks and gluons continue to look elementary; they are smaller than a hundred billionths of a trillionth of a meter./

&quot;The physical reality of Time dilation and Rest mass cannot coexist.&quot;
A gauge invariance to become massive, it must violate Lorentz invariance and relativity. ? (A failed rythm in dance). 

Up to proton distance the clock tick slow, then again tick faster in further smaller distance ? 

QED (probability density) is not a failed rythm, but QCD, color charge (top quark) is a failed rythm ? 

Standard model is a human imagination, if it is final, Realism, modernism are final. We know there are Wars - but we cannot solve it - (Kantian philosophy) ?]]></description>
