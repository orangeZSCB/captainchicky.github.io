Time dilation is a physical reality at relativity level, so it assumes the particle and black hole. 
But at quantum level due to uncertanity principle, time get shorter but energy increases - means increase in cosmoligical constant and space - no particle no black hole. 

It is a Musical chair at speed of light. If the higgs like field is Tachyonic, the color charges dancing around the chair sit and again dancing around the chair.  
The symmetry broken while sitting is the mass we observe. There is a failed rhythm in the pattern - for a period. If the period is more short, more is the energy. ?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Mathematical Fizzix is not part of actual Nature. It is a human invention-math. Our axioms. Predictions are what the Mathemagicians do. Prediction did not open any flood gates for learning. Slick priests of the day simply paid attention and ACCURATELY predicted. The POINT is they did not  understand and had no EXPLANATION as to HOW....And NEITHER do the mathematifal Fizzicists. You can predict  all day long . It is MEANINGLESS. THE GOAL is to UMDERSTAND. And have very deep explanataions for phenomena. EXPLANATION is what  allowed progress. There are many others who recognize this but will not speak up. Everything from medicine to physics is corrupted. Chicanery in journals everywhere, politics, career loss, ostracized etc. etc. 

Evidence IS OBSERVER DEPENDENT by nature and totally subjective by its very nature. Evidence is a subjective thing by nature, the very concept. Eddington experimemt was very biased. Other explanations exist. The Twin Paradox? WHy would theEarth  go 50 TIMES. around the Sun for the Earth bound twin ,  yet only ONCE  for one twin  flying in space, simply because he was flying out in space at great speed? General Relativity and time dilation are IRRATIONAL AMD WRONG.

Carneades( his video probes science as curently done is NOT RATIONAL), Mike Huttner, Bill Gaedes, all of them provide fabulous powerful argumemts against Mathemagical Fizzix. Huttner favors EXPLANATION AND RATIONALITY.]]></description>

Scientific predictions are not &quot;parlour tricks&quot;. Scientific predictions are not like priests making wild conjectures. Predictions are a natural result of a theory. A scientist makes a theory to explain evidence, and the implications of that theory (i.e the mechanisms it proposes) mean the scientist should be able to observe other phenonema (that in fact may have already been observed). It&#039;s a means of checking whether a theory is true or false. This is what a prediction is. You have yet to make any sensible argument against this. 

Evidence is not subjective. All your arguments, not counting the cod nihilism, are simply supporting my point that the interpretation might be subjective but not the evidence itself. And yes, there is more to judging evidence than simply &#039;opinion&#039;. In fact if you think everything is simply opinion then I don&#039;t see why you&#039;d ever be arguing with anyone about anything, since you&#039;d have no basis for anything other than &quot;like, it&#039;s just my opinion, man&quot;. 

If you want to understand how space-time can be curved and how time dilation works, why not learn the math? If you&#039;re not willing to learn the math, how can you criticize? You seem to think that the only limits on reality are your own current ability to understand it, and anything that isn&#039;t immediately graspable by everyday intuition is necessarily false. This is the kind of thinking that Flat-Earthers use. Do you really want to be like them? 

You obviously have an interest in this subject in general, so that&#039;s a good thing. I suggest you stop watching dubious youtube pseudoscience and get stuck in to proper science instead.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Weinberg angle, in the equation is also varying as a function of the momentum transfer, Q - coupling value locks as constant. 

The quantum vacuum is the state in which no photons are present in any of the modes of the radiation field. However the vacuum only remains empty of particles for inertial observers. If instead we posit an observer in a uniformely accelerated frame of reference, then what was a vacuum state becomes a thermal bath of photons for the accelerated observer. And what is true for accelerated observers is similarly true for regions of space-time. Momentum transfer can increase the thermal bath (vacuum energy). ?
So Alpha increases by  momentum - means not a black hole but increase in cosmological constant ? 

&quot;The physical reality of Time dilation and Rest mass cannot coexist.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There is a PARADOX, Involution of phase change of being to nothing - the local broken symmetry (ssb) is no longer - caused tunneling.

Due to radioavtivity neutrinos were discovered. Weak reaction, with its short distance can cause tunneling.
Tunneling need high energy. If high energy, short lived and unobservable.
LHC energy increased the momentum - the bump is an observable high cosmological constant - otherwise at low energies, is an unObservable due to the very short life time.]]></description>

Everyone has a,world view and biases. EVERY single person. Scientists are people first and NO LESS BIASED than any other profession. Evidence will be filtered through that no matter how hard you try. Evidence is OBSEVER DEPENDENT BY definition. And evidence is a  SUBJECTIVE  CONCEPT by its definition , its very  nature and in principle.

Look up the underdertermination of theory......... Carnaedes has excellent YouTube videos explaining this. This is a problem and there is no way to choose between the rival theories other than OPINION.]]></description>
