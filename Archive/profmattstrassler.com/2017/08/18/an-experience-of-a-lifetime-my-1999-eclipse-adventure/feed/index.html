					<description><![CDATA[Hi Matt, the 1999 eclipse was also special for me. in 1980 or so, as a 10 year old kid, I read an astronomy book about the next eclipse in Europe - 1999. I was somewhat frustrated, because this was soooooo far in the future - I would be an old man by then. And then I waited for that day and for the eclipse. And it did happen, right on time. And it was great. So many thanks for your post &#038; all the best.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s nothing wrong with the length. I&#039;m a bit shocked at the rudeness of some special snowflake named Rick. Who would like it shortened, by some unknown amount, to better suit them. Because &quot;We have lives...&quot; As if Matt Strassler somehow does not. 

 A good story often needs a bit of room to be told.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post Professor!  Thanks for sharing.  I just got back from South Carolina where the clouds luckily relented just 30 seconds before totality.  We enjoyed a clear view of totality, and my modest hobby scope revealed many prominences.  It was amazing how fast that two and a half minutes flew by, but well worth the long drive.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Your words paint a picture. As if I were there! Awaiting your book, Matt, you write so well! Just read Rovelli&#039;s book on LQG. I tweeted to him that Asher Peres had preceded Dewitt - but only got a foot-note. (Wheeler is a mover &#038; shaker.) The only reason Bekenstein got credit (in my opinion) is because he was working with Hawking. Since I only tweeted to Rovelli I did not have enough characters to say that all the field theory I know I learned from you Matt. So thanks very much for that. Sue]]></description>
