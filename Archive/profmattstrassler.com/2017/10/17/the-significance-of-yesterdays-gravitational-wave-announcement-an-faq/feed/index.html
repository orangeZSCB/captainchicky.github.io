If you go to past tense, there might be more mass and gravity near big bang. But the time slowed - means, *zero rest mass and only Energy. 

.) The term classical theory means, a theory where reduced Planck&#039;s constant h-bar = 0 is zero. 
If f =0, there is no photon, as there is no vibrating energy creating a wavelength.
Angular frequency (gravity?) prevents space expansion ?

If there is *zero rest mass,  then, only - mass from motion (change in form of energy) - the &quot;Kugelblitz&quot; ?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The design of these very large instruments (LIGO/VIRGO) is based on General Relativity (GR). GR is a classical theory, in the sense that there is only one single story, one single outcome.

On the Contrary, the Standard Model is a mish-mash of Quantum Field Theories (QFTs) like Quantum Electro Dynamics and Quantum Chromo Dynamics, and it (SM) explicitly excludes an explanation of gravitation, even though SM in a way postulates that gravitation is a fundamental force. 

SM, being a collection of QFTs is clearly NOT a classical theory: there are multiple stories, multiple outcomes, each possible outcome has its own probability of ocurrence (this is exactly what we see and measure in particle accelerators like the LHC).

For SM  there are four fundamental forces: Electromagnetism, the Weak Nuclear Force, the Strong Nuclear Force and Gravitation.

Kind regards, GEN]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So many of the observations stemming from this event seem to match predicted behavior very well.  Since that seems to be the case, can this event be viewed as further affirmation of the Standard Model of particle physics?]]></description>
