There are a few other cases where we can (we think) calculate the absolute magnitude and use that to get a direct distance estimate.  Astronomers (which I am not!) call these cases &quot;standard candles.&quot;  

The two most well known are the Cepheid variable stars, which have a relationship between their period of oscillation and their absolute luminosity, as discovered by Henrietta Leavitt and used by Hubble to infer the distances to other galaxies; and the Type Ia supernovae, which you mentioned yourself.  

The latter are white dwarves which accrete matter from a companion until they explode; it appears that Type Ia&#039;s (to first order) all generate more or less the same total energy output (absolute luminosity), which allows us to compute their distances directly.

What&#039;s new about gravitational waves is that the systems which generate them (at least, the systems which we can observe) are simple enough (two compact objects in close orbit) that we can compute the amplitude very precisely!  Most of the uncertainty in the distance estimate (for GW170817 it was 40 +/- 8 Mpc, a 20% error bar) comes from the uncertainty in estimating the masses of the system from the signal, not from the calculation itself.]]></description>

Dean,
As I recall, many of the creators/discovers of QM and GR/SR hated  some of the results that fell out from research, including their own. Was nature forcing itself on them, not the other way around?  I think you are being too critical.(Although it is true that data starved eras do result in many fanciful models) But that&#039;s &quot;life in the big city&quot;!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks Michael Kelsey for explanation. I had a cursory glance at some of the papers. But I am still not very clear. I would appreciate it very much if Matt has some time and writes a blog about it. I think this is the most unusual case where you know amplitude at the emission point and absorption point, except perhaps supernovas where we have theory how the supernovas came about.]]></description>

Thanks for taking the time to reply Mark and Matt. I could also try to understand it by comparing gravitational waves to light waves (or electromagnetic radiation, in general) instead of p-Waves in a medium,. These do not require a medium but they require the existence of a particle called photon. If gravitational waves do not require (a physical) medium, they still require a &#039;force carrier&#039; like a graviton, right? Wouldn&#039;t then the proof of existence of graviational waves be indirect proof of the existence of gravitons?
PS: I am certainly no Einstein, so I have issues imagining a &#039;curvature in nothing&#039;, i.e. a curvature without a physical surface (or boundary) of a physical object. In fact that is the way curvature is normally illustrated - with the surface of a physical sphere or torus, etc.]]></description>

That&#039;s exactly how it works.  The orbital information (the period of the waves) gives you information about the masses involved.  Once you have the masses, it is possible* to calculate the absolute amplitude of the generated gravitational waves.  That amplitude falls off like 1/R (not 1/R^2); thus, the amplitude at detection gives you a direct measurement (with some uncertainty, about 20% for GW170817) of the distance.]]></description>

Hi, Mark.  I come from an HEP background and this confused me as well.  An expert (from the Geant4 group) on electromagnetic interactions explained it to me as: X-rays come from electron behaving semi-classically (cyclotron emission, bremsstrahlung, close-in orbitals, like K- or L- shells), while gamma rays come from nulcear or particle interactions (nuclear excited states, e+/e- annihilation, etc.).  The distinction you gave about imaging vs. counting makes a lot of sense, too.]]></description>
