Thanks for explaining, I appreciate it.
You are the 1-st one who did it.
I feel a real relief and not that stupid any more.]]></description>

All three detectors are at different angles on the curved surface of the Earth, this affects the angle that the wavefront (Now a 2D plane) will pass through them. If the plane passes &#039;top to bottom&#039; through the detector (From the sky to the ground) no distortion will be observed (It will be perpendicular to the arms)

From both the amount of distortion (With identical frequency) one can detect the position of the detector relative to the wavefront and thus triangulate its origin. Confusing detection are possible,but should be reasonably rare for geometric reasons.]]></description>

Such a stream does exist; binary pulsars can be seen that are emitting gravitational waves that we cannot detect, slowly spiralling together over hundreds of thousands of years.

The big problem is that the INTENSITY of the emission increases exponentially; as does the force of gravity itself over decreasing distance. The long &#039;wind up&#039; is not seen, it&#039;s just too weak for us to currently detect. What is seen is a &#039;chirp&#039; of increasing frequency that quickly emerges from the noise, rises to a peak and then collapses at the point of merger.

As detection sensitivity rises we should see more and more of the lead up, but it will be a long time before we can detect more than the last few seconds.]]></description>

The various DOF present various problems for detection.

* Distance: Redshifting isn&#039;t too much of a problem; LIGO and similar detectors have, if not a great range, than a broad range of frequencies they can detect. The shifting is not too great,though it is significant.The bigger problem is amplitude which can take an event that emits more energy than all the stars in the observable universe and reduce its impact to a distance change of less than a proton&#039;s width. This problem required many improvements to our detectors to overcome.

Velocity: Again this isn&#039;t too big of a problem since the merger occurs at a good fraction of light speed at the end. As far as I can tell I think doppler effects aren&#039;t actually detectable given the noise in the detections.

This applies also to perpendicular velocity; the events themselves are so extreme that it&#039;s difficult for any regular motion to impact their signal significantly. We&#039;re only just able to detect them, we&#039;ve seen at least one signal that was too noisy to be reported.

Mass:distance: The mass of each hole provides a unique signature; the signal &#039;decays&#039; when the two holes are touching (or roundabout) and the frequency at that point depends on the size of the holes (Mass relating directly to ratio.) This gives a measure of the combined mass of the holes and the asymmetry in the signal shows the ratio of the two hole masses.

Heavier holes further away will inspiral at the same rate at lighter, closer holes; but their power output will be drastically less and the final frequency at the end of the &#039;chirp&#039; will differ.]]></description>

1.) Technically VIRGO IS a third detector, though there are several more running now,all that is required is some upgrades to enhance their sensitivity, much as what happened with LIGO (And VIRGO) earlier.

2.) GWs are distortions in a fundamental field, gravity, and that field is associated with a force of infinite range (massless boson). They should thus be expected to travel at light speed as do both photons and disturbances in the EM field..]]></description>

Oh definitely,and far before the actual merger. The holes are orbiting each other at a good fraction of light speed, even months before the merger. That much mass moving at that great a speed creates a massive amount of frame dragging; if you were close enough to the holes to be appreciably affected by their gravity it would be plainly obvious that something were happening just from changing tidal forces on you alone. And as the event approached the energy output would ramp up.I don&#039;t know how far away you&#039;d need to be to not be killed, close on a cosmic scale but definitely quite vast on a human one.]]></description>
