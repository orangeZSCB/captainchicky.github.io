					<description><![CDATA[In Physics there is such a concept as Quantum Vacuum which is supposedly &quot;filled&quot;  with an infinite Ocean of energy. Being Quantum it can sometimes on a random basis pop out a huge Quantum of Energy into our familiar &quot;visible&quot; World.

It well may be that Our President is such a Huge Quantum 
from the deeper Ocean to all of US in U.S.

Prof. Strassler may correct the physical part of my statement, and
 all political analysts will no doubt ignore the second part of my statement
as being just plain foolish,  but I still hold firm as an invitation to discussing possible links between Big Politics and Big Science.

					<description><![CDATA[If we squeeze a rectangle grid to square, the small grid squares would not much deformed.  For a correct square we need fine tuning or correct rhythm - but with no mass no gravity - the dead naturalness. 
But at large scale, the Diffeomorphism creates mass and gravity - the space has conservation energy - try to settle from metastable (unnatural) to stable  ? 


The dance stops locally with a &quot;correct step (Naturalness)&quot; is an individual Apocalypse - the Death - and continues again catching with a &quot;wrong step&quot; - the &quot;flip&quot; in EM !

But its Cosmic connection is gauge invariance - an almost nonRepeating pattern - also away from Natural Laws (wrong Rhythm) - evident in radio activity ! ?]]></description>

Yes it is Kantian (Immanuel Kant) ? 
Physical reality exist outside personalities (Anthropic) ? 

But this reality (mass) was due to bouncing of other universe on our one (at event horizon) - creating diffeomorphism ? 


In condensed matter the physical laws became different - by spontaneous symmetry breaking.  
So Diffeomorphism also create such symmetry breaking in our Holographic projection ? 


  In natural sciences, Nature has given us the world, and we just discovered its laws. In computers, we can stuff the laws into it and create the world. Experiments in quantum physics are now creating artificial physical systems that obey the laws of quantum mechanics but do not exist in nature under normal conditions.
An example of such an artificial quantum system is a quantum computer.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[May be you have some specifics instead of switching to personalities ?
Historical context  is not just fossils but also key to understanding present and sometimes even future.
