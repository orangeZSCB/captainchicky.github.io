					<description><![CDATA[&#062;So what’s next?  Made-up numbers for inflation, employment, the budget &#062;deficit, tax revenue?

Err, yes, yes, yes and yes.

&#062;Invented statistics for the number of people who have health insurance?
Certainly yes.

&#062;False information about the readiness of our armed forces and the cost of our self-defense?
Yes and yes.

&#062;How far will this go?  And how will we know?
Turkey. (The country. Read everything you can about it. Seriously.)
You won&#039;t know. Again, see Turkey.]]></description>

/The science itself is part of what Einstein called a very persistent illusion.

Because that is what we are, in faith we have divine power and the rules and laws of science disappear and miracles occur. In faith, I could wash my hands in acid without harm./

After Jesus death, at the abscence of Apocalypse, the &quot;mockery&quot; of then existing beliefs was invitable.   
Now at the failure of capitalism, the neo-con is inevitable. 

The choice of &quot;Human&quot; is there - but it does not mean we could wash our hands in acid ? 

&quot;Rest mass and time dilation cannot coexist&quot;. 

The persistent illusion (The &quot;You&quot; is sedimentary sediments of informations = Holographic) - makes the Rest mass and time dilation to coexist - as Equivalence principle - what we call reality. 

If we approach the truth (naturalness), it is not Uncertainty principle, but the Time dilation implies, the Mass is an illusion. ??]]></description>

Correction: in my latest message I made an error. 
SURF spelling is wrong, what I meant is SERF.

Sorry, bob-2]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@ CFT
I have the same opinion as you on the multiple atrocities you have just described. Don&#039;t have any doubts about it !!! 

But you try to redefine the meaning of a SLAVE. 
In Aristotle&#039;s time a slave was  just a THING by Law.

In Roman Empire it was a property which you could sell / buy by Law.
Sometimes gladiator slaves got freedom for good performance, though an Emperor always had a final say on this matter.

In Czarist  Russia until 1861 ( when SURFs were freed by Czar&#039;s Manifesto) a SURF ( subject who belonged to a landlord and worked on his land for him)  also could be bought/sold, but could not be killed by landlord by Law. And that was an official definition of the difference between a SURF and a SLAVE . When I said  that Russia never imported SLAVEs I meant
the meaning of a SLAVE in the above described definite sense, and not in the meaning of  a person oppressed in any other ways, including  the ways it happened in your country, which ( ways )  I certainly condemn. 

So when I wrote that Russia never imported SLAVEs, I meant the above explained definition of a SLAVE. I don&#039;t see any contradiction here. And 
those  conquered tribes were never treated as SLAVEs in above sense.
They were treated as SURFs. 

In the United States SLAVEs were liberated after the Civil War  
So history does progress, though we would like to see it happen faster.

And Russia today is not the Soviet Union you saw in Hungary.

The major pbm today is that the entire Humanity is in danger of
nuclear proliferation and possible annihilation.   

As for China, acc to my humble knowledge, she has at least 5000 years 
history. And today is the 1-st day of a Chinese New Year. I looked in my Calendar, but they don&#039;t mention which Year they are now in 
(may be b/c it&#039;s too large a number to mention or they just don&#039;t know it 
like me). I anyway  congratulate all participants of this blog with this
Special Day, if you do not mind.

Yours, bob-2]]></description>

In a contemporary article &quot;past&quot; should probably read as recent past and surely &quot;horrific&quot; doesn&#039;t imply a comparison or a hierarchy.
&quot;Old&quot; countries - that had ancient and medieval civilization - have started to shape their particular culture before.
The history of Human Rights should be carefully studied. Only a little, minor example: United States is considered to have inadequate protection for personal information and the European Data Protection Directive is a more advanced model.
Anyway what really matters here is that Trump&#039;s problems with Human Rights are clearly more horrific than his issues with &quot;alternative facts&quot;.
The Guardian these days has titled &quot;US could face human rights crisis after Trump&#039;s xenophobic immigration orders&quot;.

Finally, hostile, insulting (&quot;you are so ignorant&quot;,&quot;you are actually quite uninformed and bigoted yourself&quot; etc etc) comments reveal the nature of those haters who can&#039;t  reasonably and peacefully discuss with others.
Prof. Strassler is obviously not going to engage his readers in a stupid flame war.]]></description>
