					<description><![CDATA[i once read a book on &#039;truthiness&#039;, endorsed by Bush. I can&#039;t recall the title, but it was a very small book that dealt heavily in circular logic trying to assert that subjective truth is absolute truth is subjective. If you read the book in a semi- conscious state you might (or might not) perk up at the blatant contradictions (thankfully, it was poorly written).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[To be fair I think what they meant to say was &#039;(alternate) estimations&#039;; gauging crowd numbers is not a precise science, just look at our estimates for the &#039;million man march&#039;. Even photographic comparisons like that can be misleading (Taken at different times of day or event say or when people are elsewhere.) One could argue that the estimates given by the media were biased and that some alternatives might give a better overview of the situation. One could even argue that doing so would be good science..

However in that particular case most reliable estimates differ so greatly that there is no credible argument to be made that the 2017 crowd was larger. The treatment of the issue however I find illustrative in terms of bias and how the public deals with it.]]></description>

.... time forward means... more stable Nucleation ?]]></description>

Is that the extra dimensions are truth - or at least the quantum states are truth - in which we chose (wave function colapse) one ? 

Trump&#039;s choose another one (more disordered or increases in entropy) - because the Nucleation (rearrangement of Informations or time forward) decides which is reality ? 
This implies the slight change in the constancy of heavens ?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wonder if our &quot;post-fact&quot; world might not have some roots in the tactics of marketing, sales, and commercials. To sell products (which we often don&#039;t want or need), they manufacture this weird alternate reality that &lt;em&gt;seems&lt;/em&gt; like our reality, but which is twisted off-kilter to their own ends.

And politics has &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; been the realm of the unreal.]]></description>
