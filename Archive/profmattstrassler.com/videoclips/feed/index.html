Thank you so much for restoring this link.  I&#039;m not sure what direction or possibly new career path Matt has chosen, but it breaks my heart to think that he may no longer be involved in pedagogical pursuits (aside from this website, that is).  He is blessed with all of the gifts of the true educator, and the next generation of physicists depend crucially on the dwindling few who possess such rare and dynamic expository talent.]]></description>

Particles of a field need not have mass.  What they must have is energy.  As an example, a photon (i.e., single quantum of a wave in the electromagnetic field) has zero mass, but it has energy (in the form of motion-energy).]]></description>

I don&#039;t have a solid one but when i do see one i stretch it to the very far reaches of its use and turn it into something new, im in need of one you got any ones that i could use.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/videoclips/#comment-213310&quot;&gt;Azita&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi Azita,
While all photons travel at the speed of light, they can attain very different frequencies (recall that a photon is a single quantum of an electromagnetic wave).  The human brain has evolved to interpret different frequences as different colors.  So the entire electromagnetic spectrum (not just visible light) is the result of lightwaves being composed of many photons having many different wave frequencies.  
As an aside, the fact that we know the universe is expanding depends crucially on frequency and luminosity of light.  As a source of light moves away from the viewer, the wavelengths of its photons become elongated in the direction of the line of sight (increase in wavelength = decrease in frequency) which results in &quot;red-shift&quot; along its spectrum.  In other words, if one looks at a star through a spectroscope, the spectral lines that result from the actual star&#039;s elemental composition will shift toward the red end of the spectrum as the star recedes from the viewer.  
The opposite happens as the source of light gets closer to the viewer, that is, a shortening of wavelength (so increased frequency) which results in a &quot;blueshift&quot;.  
Another physical application of this is the search for new potential solar systems.  For example, in our own solar system it is not technically correct to say that the planets orbit the sun.  More correctly, they revolve around the CENTER OF MASS of the solar system, which, because the sun is so massive, happens to be located at a point within the sun.  In fact, the sun itself is revolving around this center of mass, which causes it to &quot;wobble&quot;.   Thus, in the search for new potential solar systems one looks for distant stars that wobble, as these could be playing the role of &quot;suns&quot;.  And the way to detect a wobbling star is to look for periodically alternating red-shifts and blue-shifts through a spectroscope.]]></description>
