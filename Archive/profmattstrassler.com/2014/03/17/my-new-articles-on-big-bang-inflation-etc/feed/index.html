					<description><![CDATA[My brother recommended I would possibly like this website.
He was once totally right. This publish truly made my 
day. You cann&#039;t consider simply how much time I had spent for this info!
Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Matt,
I don&#039;t quite get how gravity can affect polarization of light at all.
What&#039;s the physics of it in simple terms ?
Is it because at the time right after inflation the fields of gravity and electromagnetism were still ONE and further separation caused it or there are other reasons for that ?  
Please clarify my layman&#039;s Q.
Your fan, bob-2 
P.S. Sorry for the delay to coming back to your blog.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[i think that the hawking&#039;s radiation is being observed into the gravitational waves as echoes of the strongest ondulations produced in the spacetime be the inflattion-with speeds greatests that the speed of light;only inot the geometry of spacetime was inflated but the material l spacetime( quantic vacum) was inflated.

congratulions for guth,linde and Hawking.
the Works made by s donaldson in smooth toplogical geometr
might be seen as the physics generated by the geometry and vice versay]]></description>

It was all speculation in the first place; Arkani-Hamed is expressing a hope, but nothing&#039;s actually been shown about gravity, despite that article going viral.

But there&#039;s no conflict between what they&#039;re trying to do and inflation.  These ideas don&#039;t really affect each other.]]></description>
