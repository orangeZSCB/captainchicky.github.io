Such as gravity&#039;s long-range nature?  If you&#039;re throwing out all of special relativity and quantum mechanics, why call this thing a &#039;graviton&#039; anyway?]]></description>

The raisin cake analogy is intended to convey one thing:  How in an expanding universe each galaxy would observe all the distant galaxies moving away from them without this implying that any one of them is the &#039;center&#039;.  Do you understand this?  Then STOP thinking about the raisin-cake ANALOGY.

Space expands within the galaxies due to the cosmological constant.  However this expansion is very weak on this scale, and so easy counteracted by gravitational attraction.  The energy density does not change as space expands -- you have to think more carefully about conservation of energy in the context of general relativity to see why this isn&#039;t a problem.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Let&#039;s think every single cell of vacuum at Planck scale must have causal relation with all observers concerned with changes in curvature or in virtual motion schema at conventional gravitational potential states.

As net force field we seem to get DM halos, don&#039;t we.

there do not have to be restriction of quantized cell scale but maybe there will be because of quantum mechanics and uncertainty principle...]]></description>

&#039;[1305.5759] Comment on higher derivative Lagrangians in relativistic theory&#039;
http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.5759

&quot;The relativistic theory of an Aether was discussed several time, see for e.g. [8], [9]. In this paper, our hypothesis is different and gives a relativistic theory of the deformation of continuous media (for which the geometry is described by the metric field).&quot;

The Milky Way&#039;s halo is the deformation of continuous media.

The Milky Way&#039;s halo is curved spacetime.]]></description>

If you are looking for physics beyond the standard model a good start is to discard the current graviton picture and seek one that best fits the observable facts.]]></description>

The current quantum description of gravity using the graviton paradigm you describe is flawed and for that reason we still, after 50 years, have no self consistent quantum theory of gravity. A new type of graviton is needed to provide a self consistent model. One as topologically different from the orthodox model as an orange is from a doughnut.]]></description>
