					<description><![CDATA[Bad analogy - the embryo - for if you trace your embryo back far enough, you are right there at the beginning of the universe. Why am I here? Because it is obvious that the Big Bang did not originate from a &#039;singularity&#039;, and I wanted to find out what other theories there were (if by definition a singularity is composed of matter, which makes it the material part of a &#039;black hole&#039;, and our definition of a black hole is that which not even light can escape (and these are small, single-star black holes, never mind one comprised of all the matter in the universe - think of the gravity that would have to be overcome). Ah - &#039;gravity&#039; - this is why theorists must assert that gravity did not exist in the &#039;beginning&#039; of this Big Bang expansion (where it (conveniently) does not have to be &#039;overcome&#039;), and it conclusively concludes that the Big Bang did not originate from a matter-based singularity). So if our observable universe originated from such a central point (or a membrane), it was something other than a matter-based singularity (and I think that is where the state things (our understand) stands - we don&#039;t know what the &#039;something else&#039; is yet, other than in non-mathematical conjectured assertions (like membranes).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It all centers around the nature of space-time: space and time are not completely independent dimensions, they are intertwined and make up the fabric of our Universe.

In Minkowski&#039;s continuum, the coordinate system is as follows:

x,y,z,ict

The way the time coordinate is intertwined with the space coordinates is through a proportionality factor, the constant of the speed of light in vaccum.

So, in this continuum, the time coordinate itself is a space dimension through that proportionality factor, the speed of light.

During the period previous to the activation of the Higss Field, without the presence of photons, there is no intermediator (light) to make time appear and behave as we know it, so, the fourth dimension is a true space dimension during that period.]]></description>

&quot;Without photons, there is not time as we know it&quot;. Why would the existence of the time dimension depend on the Higgs field / photon field?]]></description>
