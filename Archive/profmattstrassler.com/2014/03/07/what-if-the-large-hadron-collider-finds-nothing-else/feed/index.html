					<description><![CDATA[Hello fantastic website! Does running a blog similar to this require a massive 
amount work? I have very little knowledge of programming however I was hoping to start 
my own blog soon. Anyway, should you have any ideas 
or techniques for new blog owners please share. I know this is off topic nevertheless I just wanted to ask.
Appreciate it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;&quot;â€¦ Extremely unnatural systems â€” that is, physical systems described by quantum field theories that are highly non-generic â€” simply have not previously turned up in natureâ€¦ which is &lt;b&gt;just as we would expect&lt;/b&gt; from our theoretical understanding. â€¦&quot;&lt;/i&gt;

I am sorry to ask, but could you clarify what the expectation was? I can read that sentence one way or the otherâ€¦ Was the expectation that unnatural systems would turn up? Or that unnatural systems would &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; turn up, that we would have found only &quot;natural&quot; systems? 

I expect this means the later, but am not quite sure. For someone more versed in these matters, the way to read that sentence is probably clear, but at that point in reading this article I struggled already to understand what &quot;natural&quot; and &quot;non-generic&quot; mean in that specific contextâ€¦ Oh well. :-)

And I am deeply sorry that I don&#039;t have more time to read more of your work, because then probably such &quot;pedestrian&quot; layman questions by me would probably not arise in the first place! :-)]]></description>

absolute unity absolute diversity
absolute uniformity absolute disparity
absolute stability absolute instability
absolute order absolute chaos
absolute contraction absolute expansion
absolute constancy absolute change
absolute attraction absolute repulsion

* I do not understand your absolutes; for example we see change but not everything changes (so it canâ€™t be absolute) unless we count the universe as a whole as one object in which case it changes and there is no absolute constancy. What is â€˜absolute instabilityâ€™? would that be something that is totally unstable and so never exists, or is it that nothing is truly stable or something else?

Absolutes? Absolutely. Think of the universe as existing between the forces of attraction and dark repulsion. A black hole is absolute attraction to which the rest of the left hand column conforms to. Dark energy is absolute repulsion in that there seems to be no end to its pushing things apart or to its relentless expansion. The right hand column all relates to dark energy.

Galaxies exist between the two absolutes. But the two forces are not friends of galaxies, which we all know are anomalies in the universe, with black holes eating galactic matter and dark energy pushing them around and would, if galaxies were vulnerable, take them apart.

What keeps the dark energy from invading a galaxy is its halo. Which seems to me to be comprised by a standoff between dark energy and gravity along the dark mater trapped there.

Itâ€™s all about attraction and repulsion. They are fundamental to the posited fundamental forces of the standard model. And dark energy needs to be seen as a fundamental force.]]></description>

Talking about quantum cosmology, I should have added the Bicep2 experiment to my list of former probes of CMB fluctuations ;-) I wish the inflation paradigm will find soon (tomorrow monday 17th at: http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/news/news_conferences.html ???) its best inflaton model .... connected to the already established scalar Higgs field or not!]]></description>
