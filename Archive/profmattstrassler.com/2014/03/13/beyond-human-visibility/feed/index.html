					<description><![CDATA[I do believe all of the ideas you&#039;ve presented on your post.
They are really convincing and will definitely work.
Still, the posts are very brief ffor novices. Coukd you please extend them a bbit from nest time?

Thank you for the post.]]></description>

To Matt:is the claim of the following paper (&quot;Why arguments based on photon energy may be highly misleading for power line frequency electromagnetic fields&quot; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11255216) valid or consistent with your understanding of quantum electrodynamics/standard model? (yes/no:how so?) particularly: &quot;There is in principle no difference in how much energy an electron can pick up from a low frequency electric field as compared to from a high frequency photon. Thus, the total gain in energy is not limited to the energy carried by a single photon..&quot; -&#062;true? how so? Do near-field light/photon (=evanescent light? =non-propagating light?) behave and interact with electrons/molecules/materials very differently from how propagating light does or what is predicted by quantum electrodynamics/standard model? Could an electron(s) inside biological tissues (or any common molecules in air, building, clothes etc.) pick up enough energy(=be excited) via resonance etc. under fluctuating EM field (around power lines) to release photons in UV or higher energy range occasionally? Or, could such fluctuating EM field break chemical bonds or add sufficient energy to the electrons in the bonds to alter the (biological) molecular structures?]]></description>

&quot;..couldn’t possibly cause anything other than surface damage (skin cancer and cataracts).&quot; &quot;..it’s not going to cause internal problems&quot; -&#062; sounds imprecise or possibly incorrect. Depending on the frequencies, they can penetrate deeper. And, even if they cannot penetrate deep and damage tissues directly, they could affect health via secondary mechanisms like ROS generation, UV-induced cytokine release from affected surface area (=skin and a bit beneath) and UV-induced immunosuppression etc.).]]></description>

To Matt:It (=if power lines cause health problems) depends on how they are interacting with and imparting energy to its surroundings (including with which energy range, what type, how often? at what density, etc.). For example, are we sure that they only emit UV within those measured already or they could emit electromagnetic waves in other range (higher or lower frequency outside of UV range) even though only occasionally? They should measure broader energy range, how often they are observed, and in which directions they are more likely to find the radiation off the line or parts of pylons. (&quot;..but the cameras only record a very narrow range of UV.&quot; http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/mar/12/animals-powerlines-sky-wildlife) It should be determined which (biological and other) molecules absorb how much energy from electromagnetic radiation at what wavelength, probability and if this changes any molecular structure.]]></description>
