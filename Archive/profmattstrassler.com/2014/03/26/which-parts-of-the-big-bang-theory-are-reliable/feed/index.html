@ Steve Donaldson:
I don&#039;t know if Edward is a *crackpot* either, however, I didn&#039;t call him one. Careful reading above will show that a contributor with the stated name of &quot;Notacrackpot&quot; was the entity who so cavalierly spewed out this term. Not me.

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;the observable patch of our universe, which may be a tiny fraction of the universe&quot; this &quot;may be&quot; always irritates me and for this reason: as the astronomic community became aware recently, there are minor planets beyond Pluto which have orbits that seem to be disturbed in a way that suggests &quot;out there&quot; is another giant (maybe Jupiter size) planet, as yet unobservable. Unobservable as it may be, it leaves traces that show in the behavior of nearer objects. Now if the universe were indeed larger than our &quot;observable &#039;patch&#039;&quot; - and IF there were big objects / dark matter / dark energy, galaxies, black holes etc. etc. just beyond &quot;observable&quot; surely they must interact with what is still observable in such a way as to leave traces just as the potential second Jupiter leaves on observable objects in our solar system? And is this or is it not, reflected in some of the branches of inflation theory?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] A few weeks ago there was (justified) hullabaloo following the release of results from the BICEP2 experiment, which (if correct as an experiment, and if correctly interpreted) may indicate the detection of gravitational waves that were generated at an extremely early stage in the universe (or at least in its current phase)&#8230; during a (still hypothetical but increasingly plausible) stage known as cosmic inflation.  (Here&#8217;s my description of the history of the early universe as we currently understand it, and my cautionary tale on which parts of the history are well understood (and why) and which parts are not.)

					<description><![CDATA[Professor Strassler&#039;s articles are always fantastically good, but they always leave unanswered questions AND generate new questions that he does not have time to answer (we all need to work sometimes for a living from our day job). Some of the unanswered questions I have (as, in an inflating universe with only a tiny speck of mass, where did a universe&#039;s amount of mass come from?) are neatly answered by Max Tegmark in a free excerpt from his book, &quot;Our Mathematical Universe: My Quest for the Ultimate Nature of Reality&quot;, in which he gives an explanation of inflation. You may read the free excerpt at http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/pdf/inflation_excerpt.pdf . It has also motivated me to buy his book!  Now, when will Matt&#039;s book come out?]]></description>
