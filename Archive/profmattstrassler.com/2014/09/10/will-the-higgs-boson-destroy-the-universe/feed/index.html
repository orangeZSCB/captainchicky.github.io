					<description><![CDATA[Idrop a leave a response each timje I appreciate a article onn a website or 
I have something to valuable to contribute to the conversation. Usually it is caused by the sincerness displayed 
in the post I read. And on this artile Will the Higgs Boson Destroy the Universe???

&#124; Of Particular Significance. I was movved enouygh to drop a leave 
a responsea response :) I actually do have some questions for 
you if it&#039;s okay. Is it simply me or does iit llok like like some of 
these responses appear as if they are coming frrom brain dead visitors?

:-P And, if you are posting on additional social sites, I&#039;d like to folllow 
you. Could you make a list the complete urls of all your communal pages like your linkedin profile, Facebook 
page or twitter feed?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/09/10/will-the-higgs-boson-destroy-the-universe/#comment-230840&quot;&gt;Manoj Krishnan&lt;/a&gt;.

Well a little Occam&#039;s razor here.  Assuming this is possible, it most likely has already happened to within a very small degree of the most it ever can, even assuming that it can happen more than once?  What kind of energy would be released in a hypothetical &#039;turning way up&#039;?  Enough to reach the equivalent of a Curie point for the Higgs field?  Or would it be guarenteed to not exceed that which allowed our existing seemingly stable value to &#039;crystalize&#039;?  Temperature is related to volume but is this where the analogy breaks down with magnets and it&#039;s the total heat for all space (assuming finite), not the average?  These are some nice unknowns.  There probably is some principle that keeps it just barely near the &#039;critical doomsday value&#039; that we haven&#039;t discovered yet.

That supernova power supply thing is the sort of arguments against any sane civilization building giant Deathstars and the like.  It&#039;s much simpler to just send a small asteroid their way at a good portion of light speed.  That&#039;s right - merely using the power of the engines to move a rock is just as effective as some super ray beam.  Or you know, melt only the crust of a planet instead of heating it to quadrillions of degrees or some such stupidity.  But hey, that wouldn&#039;t look as cool as an exploding globe!  :D  Hell, even a nova might not destroy an Earth-like planet like that?

As a side note, I was wanting to joke that the Higgs particle already destroyed the universe in the first second, but we just hadn&#039;t noticed &#039;yet&#039;.  This is a reference to the idea that our universe is in fact very unstable and we&#039;re just living like microbes in a corpse, blissfully unaware of larger temporal or spatial scales.  Especially the fact that the universe is slowing down from a certain POV.  In other words expansion makes it take longer for information to &#039;compute&#039; or &#039;move&#039; between a given amount of mass, not to mention the classical definition of entropy.

Another joke could have been that it&#039;s happening all the time, and like in a certain science fiction story, we just keep branching off of that possible timeline.  I&#039;ll feel like a chump if you tell me these wild guesses turn out to be likely or least not impossible.  This is freaking Boltzmann territory!  :/

I wonder what a hypothetical universe with different Higgs-like constants or even no Higgs field at all would be like.  This can count as speculative physics (like speculative history fiction), I guess...]]></description>

Well, diet soda is evil for other reasons but I doubt diabetes is the big problem, or if it is, it&#039;s because of the fact that you&#039;re also eating at Micky D&#039;s with sugar-dosed rolls and syrup-flavored sauce.  Those nasty sweeteners and their side effects are the more pressing concern.  A chemical that makes everything taste better - for &#039;diet&#039; sodas.  An appetite enhancer, in other words.  Yeah, that couldn&#039;t possibly go wrong.  :D]]></description>

The speculation Strassler wrote about a future society somehow maybe, but not likely deliberately increasing the value in a &#039;seed&#039; space brings up an interesting moral dilemma.  What if you knew that life would 100% surely end if you didn&#039;t do it like a fire with no more air and fuel, but that there was a small chance that the new vacuum state would support any kind of complex life?  Small being smaller than my chances of getting hit with a meteorite as I&#039;m typing this.

BTW, Supernova was a way awesome movie!  It&#039;s about this exact idea of some super-smart people(we assume as viewers) creating a universe-ending device and leaving it just sitting around for the new kids on the block to destroy themselves with.  Me thinks the inventors from who-knows-how-long-ago didn&#039;t survive the first &#039;test&#039; in that story.  The writer must have been thinking of stuff like the hysteria over LHC and classics like &#039;Ice-9&#039;.  BTW, there are many know types of &#039;ice&#039;, just counting H2O variants.  Just like with diamonds, there&#039;s forms that seem to only exist (or form) in special circumstances.]]></description>

Hmm, makes me wonder how one would go about measuring that sort of thing in a region of space with extreme blue shift.  A &#039;frame of reference&#039; with &#039;gravity-well-like properties&#039; in Einsteinian lingo.  Anyone want to volunteer for the first near-light-speed ship?  Not that we&#039;ll ever build one anytime soon if at all, hehe.]]></description>
