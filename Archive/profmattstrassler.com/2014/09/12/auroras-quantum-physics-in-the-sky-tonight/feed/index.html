Thank you Mr. Kudzu, I typed the above at my workplace interval, sorry if any mistskes.
I believe relativity is like involution of separate things, who cannot be separated - union of space and time - rest mass is the product of this union.
So in reality, &quot;rest mass and time dilation cannot coexist&quot;. It may be due to inflation rather than length contraction ? 
The time dilation in general relativity, it the lowest energy level in lorentz transformation (clock slow at lowest energy level) - but due to inflation or uncertanity principle, further lowest energy level will decrease the entropy.]]></description>

At the absence of Lorentz invariance and relativity, Goldstone massless mode became the longitudinal polarization of a massive spin-1 “photon. So a gauge invariance to become massive, it must violate Lorentz invariance and relativity. 
The asymmetric ground state (“vacuum” in quantum field theory), excitations
around the trough of the wine bottle potential - IS NOT INVARIANT.  So Higgs mechanism did not work for short range forces.  But it worked for weak force W and Z bosons because of &quot;radioactivity&quot;  and flavor change - in which akin to EM in charge separation and comply  Lorentz invariance and relativity.
At high energy, like in super conductivity they become massive but photon remain massless, due to long range. 

So inside proton no mass energy and momentum, only kinetic energy - and the parameters of space itself (vacuum). 
If this &quot;vacuum&quot; (parameter) spent extended time in a long lived configuration other than the system&#039;s state of least energy (Lorentz invariance) - this parameters reach and hold stationary values. While in isolation of Lorentz invariance.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[thanks a lot for the information you have given on the comets. i think i have seen it and also shown it to my friends in the hostel. it was a light green spray kind of thing. a good display by particles on the stage of nature.

sir i am interested in theoretical and particle physics can you kindly suggest me websites to give out my ideas and allow it for the discussion.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There exists a relation between energy, mass, velocity and momentum; E^2 = p^2c^2 + m^2c^4. This means momentum can be defined as p = √(E^2 - m^2c^4 / c^2) This works for both massive things and massless things like photons 

The error lies in p = mv; it is inaccurate because it neglects relativity. (If it was right then you could move faster than light quite easily.) So momentum works the same way everywhere, but you have to be careful how you calculate it.


Momentum can be calculated in several ways. If you are considering something as a moving mass then it is the product of mass and velocity. More accurate you should consider it the product of energy (Both mass energy and kinetic energy among other things.) and velocity.

But you can also treat all particles]]></description>
