...  The CHAOS inside the Proton - an attempt to squiggle up into disorder state against the inflation.
Another hint of an important link between quantum information and Gravity.

					<description><![CDATA[As for hidden information, think of it as being temporarily hidden. When some information is inside the black hole, you can&#039;t access that information and the black hole has a corresponding entropy. When the black hole evaporates away, there is nothing left to contain the entropy, so the information must have been sent out somehow and it&#039;s now un-hidden (or so it&#039;s believed, as of today). Again, I don&#039;t think there&#039;s a concrete calculation to establish this definitively -- mainly since we don&#039;t have a good handle on quantum gravity.-- physics stack exchange.

If the hidden (chaotic) information made un-hidden, there will be no mass, so there is no need of quantum gravity.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Fortunately, CCTV security systems can be obtained at a 
number of price points, ensuring affordability for individuals, families and businesses of all sizes.
On top of the, this Security DVR can operate four tasks simultaneously.
Cctv dvr card software In many retail institutions, police stations, prisons, as well as high security scientific and manufacturing facilities,
the application of wireless CCTV video security cameras are normal.


What&#039;s more valuable is that you simply are careful along with your 
CCTV systems to acquire the very most from them also to improve 
your security around possible. The alarm system of CCTV is a lot 
more secure than any internet-based camera monitoring.]]></description>
