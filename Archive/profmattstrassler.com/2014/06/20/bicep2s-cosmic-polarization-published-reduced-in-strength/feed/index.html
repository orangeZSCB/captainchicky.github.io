I think you have a logical contradiction there: You are trying to explain the uniformity by a process of thermalization that happened infinitely fast in no time at all. But a process by definition happens over a certain time. Without time, you do not have a process but just a condition. So effectively you are saying &quot;at the beginning there was an (almost) totally uniform condition&quot;, which is not an explanation but just a re-statement of the original riddle.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[IMHO, 
The Higgs mass found in the LHC at Geneva of 126 GeV,is interpreted as pure oscillatory energy of real “new Higgs” vacuum particles.
The new Higgs particles are supposed to be convertible by an internal rotational structure they
are responsible for the creation of “Something” out of “Nothing”

Re: &quot;If energy can radiate arbitrarily far in space without time passing&quot;

You seem to assume that massless particles travel with infinite speed. This is not so. Massless particles travel with a finite speed c, called the &quot;speed of light&quot; (in vacuum), which is the same no matter which observer in which state of motion measures the particle&#039;s speed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We believe that the early universe was extremely hot and dense and that these conditions produced a large number of very heavy particles, including stable magnetic monopoles. As stable particles, they should have persisted to the present day. Using the Big Bang model alone, they should exist with an abundance that would make them easily detectable. Our theoretical explanation for why magnetic monopoles have not been detected is based on a speculative theory of cosmology, the theory of Inflation. The period of exponential expansion of space that the Inflationary model predicts would have occurred after the universe had cooled below the temperature where magnetic monopoles could be produced. Thus, the magnetic monopoles existing at that time would have been diluted to the point where the chance of finding one in our observable universe would be essentially zero. The fact that theory predicts that magnetic monopoles must exits, together with the fact that we do not seem to be able to find them, is one of several arguments in favor of  cosmic Inflation. 

When I was 12-13 years old, I first came to know about the Einstein&#039;s Theory of Relativity explained by cartoons in a Soviet Russia magazine called Sputnik. I never understood it except the time travel. Then I felt it was the speed of light &quot;c&quot; is important rather than the relativity itself. Now I feel his equation hide in a tricky manner the &quot;mathematics of cosmic law&quot;- means &quot;the mathematics governs the cosmos didn&#039;t want humans to exist&quot;. 

His &quot;momentum&quot; embedded in &quot;c^2&quot; itself says, the necessity of cosmic INFLATION to hold the definition of mass - the magnetic dipole (or spin, angular momentum).]]></description>
