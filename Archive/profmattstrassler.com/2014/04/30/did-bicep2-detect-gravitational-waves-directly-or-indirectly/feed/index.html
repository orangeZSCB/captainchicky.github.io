					<description><![CDATA[I drop a comment when I apprciate a post on a website or 
I hqve something to contribute to the discussion. It&#039;s caused by the sincerness displayed in the postt I browsed.

And onn this poset Did BICEP2 Detect Gravitational Waves Directly orr Indirectly?

&#124; Of Particular Significance. I was moved enough to 
drop a comment :) I actually do have a ffew questions for you if yoou don&#039;t 
mind. Is iit simly me or doo some of the rrmarks come across like left bby brain dead individuals?
:-P And, if you are writing at additional places, I&#039;d like too follow you.
Could yyou make a list everey one of your commuhal pages like your Facebook 
page, twitter feed, or linkedin profile?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I believe what you published made a ton of sense.
But, think on this, suppose you wrote a catchier title?
I am not suggesting your content is not good, but suppose you added a post title that 
makes people desire more? I mean Did BICEP2 Detect Gravitational Waves Directly or Indirectly?
&#124; Of Particular Significance is a little vanilla. You should look at Yahoo&#039;s home page and note how 
they write article headlines to grab viewers to click.
You might add a video or a picture or two to get people excited about what you&#039;ve written. Just my opinion, it might make your 
posts a little bit more interesting.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Write more, thats all I have to say. Literally, it seems as though 
you relied on the video to make your point. You obviously know what youre talking about, why throw away your intelligence on just posting videos to your weblog when you could be giving us something 
enlightening to read?]]></description>

checkbox and now each time a comment is added I get three emails
