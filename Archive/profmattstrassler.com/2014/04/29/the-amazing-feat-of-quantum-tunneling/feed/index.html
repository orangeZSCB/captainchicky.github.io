					<description><![CDATA[Although I wrote this to the comments in the article itself, it&#039;s lost in a pile of cracked pottery, so again: there is a difference between the classical analogy of motion of a localized electron and the wavefunction. The wavefunction tells only about probability, not observed presence. In this sense a tunnelled electron hasn&#039;t classically jumped from well to well. It &quot;was&quot; already there, we just happened to observe it there at an instant. Next instant it may have &quot;gone back&quot;, and done that thousand times if we were there to observe, but the wavefunction still sits perfectly still. A graph like in Atkins Phys.Chem. would help a lot.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Prof. Strassler,
The most interesting thing about this is the inference that the electron will only tunnel if there is another energetically viable location nearby, as if the electron can in some sense &#039;detect&#039; the presence of another &#039;trap&#039;. Does this imply that an electron has some extension in space?. i.e smudged over a 3D patch of space rather than a point jiggling around very fast. This picture would certainly make it easier for me to think about the double slit experiment. Instead of thinking about a point of zero size travelling in a straight line and then being surprised when it &#039;interferes with itself&#039;, why not a moving, stable field-ripple with a sphere of influence such that part of it goes through both slits, but with only enough energy to produce a single electron transition.(hence detecting the electron destroys the experiment).
Is this a plausible model for thinking about electrons and tunneling? After all the electric field in theory extents to infinity, so could an electron field itself have some extension?

Thanks for the article.]]></description>
