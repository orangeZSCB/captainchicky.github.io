This is &quot;dog bites man&quot; news.  If they hadn&#039;t found it, that would be news.  The process they describe, up quark + down anti-quark --&#062; top quark + bottom anti-quark, involves a combination of two processes that we already know occur: the interaction of up and down quarks with the W field on the one hand, and the interaction of top and bottom quarks with the W field on the other hand.  So 1+1=2 --- it&#039;s a nice measurement, but it&#039;s exactly as expected.]]></description>

Learning by heart and obey what people with money is &quot;now a days&quot; is more practical for survival. The cats are more clever in this. What about Rats and cockroaches. They are more old and something to tell about dinosaurs ?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[/Though evolution left us with many wonderful abilities, it does seem that, year by year, humans are becoming less and less practically useful./-- well said Professor.
Nature is intuitive. If we accept the non-intuitive of mathematical axioms, the human will become, tool of the machine. 
The strength of gravity, if it were any stronger, stellar matter would bind more strongly and stars would use their nuclear fuel much faster, thus negating the possibility of the evolution of life. 
Due to cumulative nature, the shielding effect of electromagnetic force in spacetime and the gravitational effect on the scale of individual particles, is negligible. This is important in defining the deep understanding of what kind of property mass really is ? 

The wave has to have the right Amplitude to represent exactly one particle. The momentum at cosmic level appears constant - but not on the quantum level. Massless particle means, the quantization of gauge invariance is arbitrary with the &quot;momentum&quot; proportional to the energy. ?
So cope this with cosmological level (also in between ball and the spring) need mathematical aggregation - which define the rest mass - also an arbitrary. ?]]></description>

We have always been dependent on technology.  It&#039;s our primary survival strategy.  Notice that we don&#039;t have fangs or claws or run super fast, etc.  The reason we are such a tremendously successful species is that toolmaking has turned out to be a very good survival strategy indeed.  (Also, you say humans are proud of their achievements, but I see no evidence of this.  Comments like yours are actually the only ones I ever see or hear on the subject.)

I can&#039;t imagine why you think technology is a &quot;dead end&quot;.  Especially since it is the only thing nature has come up with so far that has the potential to spread life beyond this one tiny dust speck into the inconceivably vast space around us.  If anything, it is biological evolution that is turning out to be a dead end, as the other life forms on Earth, unable to change fast enough to keep pace with our ultra-rapid innovation, are unfortunately being so drastically out-competed by humans that they are actually becoming extinct!  That is what a dead end looks like.  If our way of life really were a dead end, there would be no need for environmentalism.  That&#039;s why I think views like yours are dangerous.

&quot;Some future catastrophe will probably render all accumulated knowledge useless...&quot;
Why do you think that?  And can you think of any possible example of such a catastrophe, but that wouldn&#039;t also eliminate the accumulated knowledge represented by our DNA?  Are you sure you&#039;re not just parroting what you&#039;ve seen in science fiction stories?

&quot;...the total loss of instinct...&quot;
What total loss of instinct would that be?  You think the instincts encoded in human DNA have changed somehow due to technology?  That doesn&#039;t make any physical sense.

&quot;...and ability to survive...&quot;
Actually, humans are the most adaptive species on Earth.  We are the one species with the greatest chance of surviving any random unknown catastrophe, because thanks to our toolmaking, we can respond to changing circumstances much more quickly than other species can.

The now-universal anti-human ideology of the developed world is becoming so extreme that it is starting to look like a parody of itself.  Seriously, somebody needs to put the brakes on this nonsense.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Though evolution left us with many wonderful abilities, it does seem that, year by year, humans are becoming less and less practically useful.   But at least our dogs will comfort us in our obsolescence.&quot;

So true. Humans are so proud of their achievements but as we become more and more dependent on technology we are actually taking the dead end siding on evolution&#039;s rail network. Some future catastrophe will probably render all accumulated knowledge useless and the total loss of instinct and ability to survive will ensure the demise of humankind. Pretty comforting thought acutally for the planet and all ecosystems that are not yet destroyed by then.]]></description>
