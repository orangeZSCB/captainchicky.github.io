Total spin is a positive quantity, just like the square of a real number is always positive.  The spin along a particular axis can be negative, but when we say that the graviton has spin 2, we mean that its spin along a particular axis can be at most 2 or -2.

In short, there is no such thing as a &quot;negative spin&quot; particle.  Any attempt to define such a thing would give a theory that is physically inconsistent (it would give negative probabilities for many processes.)]]></description>

...So,  if the graviton with spin +2 is the theorized boson by which an attractive force comes to be created and acting between all matter particles, am I to understand that there is no possibility for there to be some other kind of [within LHC&#039;s Tev range] boson being discovered, perhaps with spin -2 (??),  which brings-about a repulsive force (i.e., &quot;negative gravity&quot;---my term) between all matter particles and for which some &quot;big brother&quot; different boson but with analogous repulsive-agency attribute---plausibly being present very, very, very early following the Big Bang moment?  If not,  could you briefly relate your thoughts on the possible physics that would have produced the speculated &quot;cosmological inflation phenonemon&quot; starting about 10E-35 seconds which seemingly provides resolution to the cosmological horizon problem faced under the &quot;standard Big Bang&quot; (as contrasted from the &quot;inflationary Big Bang &quot;) modeling?  Thank you!]]></description>
