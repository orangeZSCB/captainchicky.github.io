The time to form a black hole via, say, the collapse of a star is a few seconds.  The time for such a black hole to evaporate is longer than the lifetime of the universe.

Even though water evaporates in sunlight, that does not prevent you from pouring water on the ground and making a puddle.  The former takes much longer than the latter.

That said, if you make a puddle that&#039;s just a few atoms, it may evaporate as quickly as you form it.  And a tiny black hole can evaporate on very short time scales, too.

But big ones evaporate much more slowly than they can form.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I read  the following question in a forum

&quot;something has always struck me as fishy with these black holes. If they are so unstable as to evaporate by Hawkins radiation, it seems to me they should not form in the first place. The Hawkins radiation should already appear during their collapse, and prevent it.&quot;

what is the answer to this ?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Scientific theories are tools, and like all tools do, they have a scope.

Tools work well within their scope, but get lousier results when they are used further away from their scope. This problem of the scope of tools is very well described by that popular phrase: &quot;When all I have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail&quot;, and you can imagine somebody banging a screw with a hammer.

Scientific theories have a scope, and they work well and can give a proper description of nature for regimes within the scope of said theory.]]></description>

This is complicated, because time is a wacky thing in general relativity.  For example, it will be very different for an observer who goes flying into the strongly curved region of the black hole, where general relativity says there&#039;s a singularity (but which probably isn&#039;t so singular in the real quantum theory of gravity), as opposed to an observe who fires up a powerful rocket and is able to stay away from the singularity for a while.  In any case, the person inside the horizon is destroyed somehow before evaporation is complete.  I haven&#039;t calculated the minimum time this would appear to take, but one could do that; I don&#039;t think one could calculate the maximum apparent time because it would depend on the precise way that destruction of the observer and evaporation of the black hole conclude, and these aren&#039;t known.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[These are exciting problems, but maybe not fully realistic - I&#039;m only saying that we should consider them in a perspective. There used to be an old good Newton&#039;s system, elegant, and consistent. Then it was found that it did not describe electromagnetic fields (or high-velocity objects) properly, and a special relativity was born. It is elegant, and consistent; Maybe it has limits, too. A general relativity allows for singular solutions, and we are seriously stretching the equations - in a sense, to infinity. Maybe there are limits to this elegant and consistent theory, too. There are cracks already appearing - we have to postulate dark matter and dark energy to obtain an agreement with observation.]]></description>

I think it also shows an effect particular to the sciences and math: people respect others enough to talk openly about their flawed or incomplete arguments. Physicists aren&#039;t going to be sycophants to Hawking, they&#039;re going to treat him like a physicist and evaluate his ideas on their merits. Likewise Hawking respects the physics community, and clearly welcomes people working on and criticizing his ideas. He&#039;s not going to assume people will take what he says on faith, he&#039;s going to want others to help examine the ideas, find flaws, and form them into a  consistent set of equations.

Outside of science/math most people consider telling someone they&#039;re wrong or asking for evidence of a statement to be at least somewhat rude. Inside it&#039;s standard procedure, and someone who blindly accepts new propositions will be considered gullible at best.]]></description>
