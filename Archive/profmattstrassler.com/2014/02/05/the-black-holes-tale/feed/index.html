					<description><![CDATA[Even Microsoft’s new CEO (not me;) finds relaxation by reading poetry.

If I understood well, I probably wouldn’t have to say “damn hell”.
Beginners struggle to grasp their mind around;
Great poets are hardly found.
Happy mediums sailing between hot and cold,
Hail the charms they may hold.
Quantum Theory is not dead;
And Matt had the word spread.
O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/02/05/the-black-holes-tale/#comment-174522&quot;&gt;duffieldjohn&lt;/a&gt;.

Mr.Duffieldjohn, I think in GR,  the curvature of spacetime is directly related to the energy and momentum of whatever matter and radiation are present. Black holes formed when the momentum is stopped - momentum is basic for mass-energy invariance, Gauge invariance. The solution of the Einstein field equations is valid for any mass &quot;M&quot;, so in principle (according to general relativity theory) a Schwarzschild black hole of any mass could exist if conditions became sufficiently favorable to allow for its formation.

But due to cosmological constant is not zero, &quot;M&quot; (rest mass) cannot be formed - Thus the black hole also ? It is only a compactification ? 

But black hole formation is possible if &quot;space time&quot; formed by conservation of radiation (massless or nearly massless particles), succumb to its own POSITIVE PRESSURE like whirlpool - toggle between baryonic matter and non-baryonic matter ?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Matt: the poem is nice enough, but IMHO you need to address the physics here. The waterfall analogy is not supported by GR. There is no sense in which space falls inwards in a gravitational field - this &lt;i&gt;Chicken Little&lt;/I&gt; myth persists because it&#039;s promoted by people like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/infinity-and-beyond/409069.article&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Max Tegmark&lt;/a&gt;. So why doesn&#039;t the light get out of a black hole? You&#039;re standing with your vertical laser pointer on a gedanken planet. We make it smaller and denser, but at no point does the light beam bend round or slow down or fall back. You &lt;I&gt;know&lt;/I&gt; about gravitational time dilation and the coordinate speed of light. You &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; the coordinate speed of light is said to be zero at the event horizon. You &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/I&gt; that virtual particles aren&#039;t actual particles that &quot;pop&quot; into existence. You &lt;I&gt;know&lt;/I&gt; that there are no negative-energy particles. And you &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; that the coordinate speed of light applies to Hawking radiation too. IMHO when you do address the physics, you come to appreciate that this whole thing is hypothetical hustle, hyped into a &quot;woo, paradox&quot; soundbite that can be &lt;i&gt;milked&lt;/I&gt;.]]></description>
