					<description><![CDATA[Regarding the mass of stars and how that affects the collapse of the star at the end of its &quot;regular&quot; lifecycle (as a burning star), we should take into consideration the models and calculations of the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff  limit (regarding stars collapsing into a black hole) and the  Chandrasekhar limit (regarding stars collapsing into a neutron star).

The models are so complex due to the physics involved, that it is considered a first approximation calculation, because there is uncertainty regarding what is the smallest mass of a star that would turn into a black hole after its collapse.

It is my understanding that we can have a model of the density of a neutron star that is fairly accurate, as well as the fact that this calculation can be validated experimentally.

Pertaining to the calculation of the density of a black hole, it is my understanding that the models for such a thing are much more complex to go beyond a first approximation kind of metrics.]]></description>

I&#039;m not impressed; you notice there&#039;s no discussion of the *dynamics* of such an object.

Really, you should view this as the calculation of the MAXIMAL density that a stable, &lt;strong&gt;non-collapsing&lt;/strong&gt; object of size r can possibly have; if its density is any larger, it inevitably collapses to form a black hole.  You should NOT view this as the density of a black hole, because the stuff in the black hole never stops collapsing, and the black hole (unlike the sun) is not full of material out to its radius r; nor is its physical volume 4/3 pi r^3.

So what you&#039;ve learned is simply this: that for a very large object, the density of material needed to form a black  hole is less than it is for a very small object.  But this is NOT the density of a black hole.]]></description>

The following is from The Physical Foundations of General Relativity by D.W. Sciama : 

“For the sun GM/c^2r is unity for r ~ .75 km…It is possible however, that much more massive objects than the Sun exist that are sufficiently compact for the corresponding  distance r to lie outside them. The mean density of an object for which r is just on its surface is 3c^6/4piG^3M^2. For a body of solar mass this density is 2x10^17 gm/cm^3 which exceeds nuclear densities (~ 10^15 gm/cm^3). However, since density is proportional to 1/M^2, an object of 10^9 Solar mass with a mean density less than 1 gm/cm^3 could still exhibit strongly non-Newtonian properties near its Surface.”]]></description>

Where have you read it?  I have never heard a professional refer to the density of a black hole. In a simple Schwarzschild black hole, things inside the black hole keep falling and falling until they hit the singularity. The black hole interior is actually mostly or completely empty of material, and the energy that looks like &quot;mass&quot; from the outside is stored in the gravitational fields, which are highly relativistic and not at all like ordinary material.  But maybe I am unfamiliar with the way general relativists talk about it??]]></description>

Alain,

If you define a black hole as an object having an escape velocity &#062; c, then the distance for which this is true = 2Gm/c^2 under GR (no rotation, no net charge, etc) just as you stated. And yes, if you have enough mass the black hole need NOT be very dense. And yes, if you plug in the numbers the ‘universe’ may be a black hole with an event horizon on the order of 10^27 m. I have read this many times in many different places, so I’m a little surprised by the reaction here.]]></description>

In case, Matt does not get time to answer your question, here is a website of particle data group at Lawrence Berkeley Lab, which lists SM and GR  and even Maxwell&#039;s eqs.
http://pdg.lbl.gov. Look at the review articles , not the particle data tables. Your tax money paid for this!!!]]></description>
