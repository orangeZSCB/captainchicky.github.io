					<description><![CDATA[of course like your web site but you have to test the spelling on quite a few of your posts.
A number of them are rife with spelling problems and I in finding it very bothersome 
to inform the truth on the other hand I&#039;ll certainly come again again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Fantastic goods from you, man. I have understand your 
stuff previous to and you are just extremely great.
I actually like what you have acquired here, really like what you are 
saying and the way in which you say it. You make it entertaining and 
you still care for to keep it wise. I can&#039;t wait to read much more from you.
This is actually a wonderful site.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know whether it&#039;s just me or if everyone else encountering problems with your site.
It appears as if some of the written text in your 
posts are running off the screen. Can somebody else please comment and let 
me know if this is happening to them too? This 
could be a issue with my web browser because I&#039;ve had this happen previously.
Thank you]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Doesn&#039;t quantum entanglement indicate that there could, indeed, be an aether? Not necessarily a &quot;medium&quot;, like a field, but rather geometry, space.

We perceive space as 3-dimensional because we can only &quot;see&quot; it as prescribed by predominantly quarks, the building blocks of our 3D world. 

Another way of asking the question (above) is, is space fundamental to everything, including the creations of fields? i.e. &quot;nothingness&quot; ~ homogeneous space, which can only exist instantaneously because of chaos. So, it is the harmonics of space that create the field and associated &quot;particles&quot;. The &quot;wave&quot; is merely a manifestation of the space continuum, composed of curved conduits all connected, an infinite dimensional Mobius strip. And the dimensions we live in are the fundamental harmonics of space.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/02/28/brane-waves/#comment-178486&quot;&gt;Edwin Steiner&lt;/a&gt;.

it&#039;s the opposite for me.  Most of the intuition is obvious and inline with what other experts are doing.  Juan is setting up a system that is essentially like a toy model of a blackhole.  The Hilbert space is truncated but it has all the features of what one expects from a well behaved horizon.  The great benefit is that you can in principle calculate things in his setup and the problem in principle becomes mathematically tractable.  His method presumably allows people to track the entanglement more precisely.

This hasn&#039;t been done yet, or at least he hasn&#039;t shown it, but I think that&#039;s the play.  Of course I don&#039;t understand how or why this is justified, why this shows a problem with AMPs argument (it seems to be a very special construction and not something that would be generic) and moreover I don&#039;t know how to calculate with tensor networks.]]></description>
