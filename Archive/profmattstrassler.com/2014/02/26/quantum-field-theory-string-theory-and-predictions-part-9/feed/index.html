Once we understand it, it definitely could help.  But first, we can&#039;t calculate most things of interest in this theory yet.  [We have a hard enough time calculating in quantum field theory, as I&#039;ve emphasized in parts 4-7 of this series!]  Moreover, we don&#039;t know, right now, which of these enigmas that you&#039;ve mentioned is actually due to quantum gravity!  None of them, or all of them, may require the theory of quantum gravity; the explanations could all be due to unknown particles and fields, which might not be *uniquely* predicted by M theory.

I&#039;ll address the fact that M theory, though it might be unique, doesn&#039;t easily give unique predictions, especially for particles physics, in the next post in this series.]]></description>

Well, this is tricky to say precisely.

The complete absence of supersymmetry in any part of the theory may well make the theory ill-defined.  We just don&#039;t know what happens in that case.

But supersymmetry that is invisible to our current and even far-future experiments, but which hides in extremely short distances and very high energies that are not currently accessible, can make the theory sensible.  In that case, the branes clearly can still be there.]]></description>

Umm... no comment.  I haven&#039;t read his book yet.  M theory has nothing to do with it though, I think.]]></description>

There&#039;s nothing here that I strongly agree or disagree with... maybe too many things for me to grapple with at once.  I don&#039;t know what the universe is telling us right now, and the little hints of this and that are not very persuasive.  So I think we have to keep helping our experimental colleagues, both by giving guidance and support with the measurements they are currently making, and by proposing new types of measurements that they might attempt.]]></description>

1) Yes, he&#039;s correct.  I&#039;ll probably get to that in part 11 or 12; it&#039;s far, far too subtle to explain in a comment, so please be patient.  The fact that it&#039;s true is why Juan Maldacena is famous, and it is also the basis of all of my work with Polchinski.  

2) Who said mathematics is easy to prove?  It took 350 years to prove that a^n + b^n = c^n, for a, b, c  positive integers and n an integer greater than 2.  It will certainly not be &quot;easy&quot; to prove string theory = quantum field theory.  We haven&#039;t even proven many of the facts stated here about field theory itself: https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/11/20/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-7/  But there is in fact an enormous amount of circumstantial evidence in a wide range of cases.  For example, there are some field theories in which certain quantities can be calculated exactly; and those quantities can be compared with certain string theory calculations, and they agree.  So much as I would like to prove it, or see someone else do so, I am not worried that it might turn out to be false.]]></description>
