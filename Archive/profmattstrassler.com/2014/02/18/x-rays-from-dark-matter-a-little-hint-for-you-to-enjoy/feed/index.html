Thanks, Neal!  [Neal Weiner is one of the world&#039;s experts on the particle physics possibilities for dark matter.]  Any thoughts on Finkbeiner et al&#039;s latest paper?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Boyarsky paper is both redundant and a cross check. They claim to see it in Perseus, but also M31 (which the Bulbul group didn&#039;t study).

The paper (1402.4119) lists three criteria for rejecting observations: 1) count rates deviate too much from the mean value, 2) F_in - F_out ratio too high, 3) MOS1 camera data before the loss of one of the CCDs is rejected (only applied for Andromeda, I think).

1 and 2 aim to reduce the influence of solar events, I think. I&#039;m not sure about the reason for 3.

It is not clear to me which of these criteria (if any) caused the exclusion of the on-center Perseus observations.]]></description>

Do they explain why they throw away the Perseus data?  If they did that post-facto (i.e., AFTER looking at the data) then that would be suspect.]]></description>

It&#039;s not the same data set, but I&#039;m not sure whether there is any overlap. In 1402.4119 they state &quot;Two observations on-center (ObsIDs 0305780101 and 0085110101) are not included in the analysis.&quot;. These are exactly the two observations listed in 1402.2301 for the Perseus cluster, so it seems there is some independence. Maybe this is also the reason that 1402.4119 does not see the anomalously high flux from Perseus. Both analyses use the XMM instruments, but a straight-forward error from the instruments seems unlikely because of the per-cluster blueshift applied in the 1402.2301 analysis.

From my complete outsider&#039;s perspective the most likely way for this exciting hint to go away would be if someone finds a way how baryonic matter could create this line.]]></description>
