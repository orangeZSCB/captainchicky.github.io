					<description><![CDATA[Wonderful comments.

Looking back at Galileo, he was a great scientist who also experienced a great deal of good luck.  Of course, he made the most of that luck with his ambition, his intelligence and his unbounded self-confidence.

As for his run-in with the Catholic church---complicated is the only way to describe it, along a certain amount of straight-up bad luck and, not least, some overreaching on his part.  For instance, I&#039;ve never heard of anybody besides his most ardent and least critical supporters who ever believed his  theory of the tides*, and yet at least according to some accounts that was what Galileo considered the &quot;smoking gun&quot; that would overthrow contemporary orthodoxy.  If true, that was a major mistake on his part.  He accidentally set up a straw man that could be used (incorrectly and illogically) to discredit his other ideas.

*His theory of the tides was just straight-up wrong, and his contemporaries knew it.  Even then, educated folk besides Galileo knew perfectly well the tides were related, in some complicated way, to the moon.  The more independent ones asked him to please not use tides as evidence because it was so very wrong and just muddied the waters.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[BTW, Pauli&#039;s Exclusion principle is also responsible for stopping the gravitational collapse of white dwarfs. This effect is called electron degeneracy pressure, but it can only work for stars smaller than 1.44 times the mass of our Sun. This is the Chandrasekhar limit.

Stars larger than this limit will become either neutron stars or black holes.

Kind regards, GEN]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It is always good to remember that Galileo&#039;s conceptions of motion, and especially of our place in the Universe, were so radical that he was made to suffer for them. It is the nature of &quot;the establishment&quot;—whether historical or modern—to resist change.

Notice also that Galileo&#039;s astronomical observations facilitated our understanding of gravity-induced motion OVER the surfaces of large bodies like the Earth and Sun. Whereas his suggestion to probe the nature of gravitational motion INSIDE gravitating bodies has never been taken up.

In his famous &quot;Dialogue&quot; there are three instances (UC Press 2nd ed., pp. 22, 227, 236) in which Galileo suggested dropping a cannon ball through the center of Earth to observe how gravity works inside matter. A hole through Earth is impossible of course. But with a modified Cavendish balance or an orbiting satellite Galileo&#039;s experiment could be done fairly easily with modern technology.

For all we know &quot;about the basic workings of the Universe,&quot; our knowledge of how gravity works inside matter is still based on guesswork and extrapolation. Why not fill this gap in our knowledge with empirical evidence? Why not carry out Galileo&#039;s experiment? (Small Low-Energy Non-Collider)?

Resistance from the establishment?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yes, I meant the move to Florence from Padua. The loss of his eyesight and daughter were of course great tragedies. What I find interesting is that just like Oppenheimer Galileo wanted to both save the world and please the politicians. Both underestimated the vindictiveness of the politicians and their relish for holding on to power. And thus both became martyrs (certainly in the public imagination).]]></description>

Well, I don&#039;t think the loss of his daughter or of his eyesight had much to do with greed.  As for whether he was greedy for power and influence, I&#039;m not sure; he certainly desired that the church change its teaching, and when one of his supporters became pope, he thought he could succeed in winning the day.  But there he badly miscalculated.  [In the long run, of course, he won -- and I&#039;m sure he knew he would win, because he had facts on his side.]]]></description>
