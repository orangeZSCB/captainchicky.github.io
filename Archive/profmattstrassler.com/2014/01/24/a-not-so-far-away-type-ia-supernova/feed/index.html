The expansion of the universe is always changing. Traditionally it was believed it was a maximum when the universe was young and gravity acted to slow it. There were two possibilities, either the expansion stopped and reversed or it didn&#039;t. (A &#039;flat&#039; universe was a special case where the expansion only just kept going but very nearly stopped.)

This would depend on the density, not total amount, of matter in the universe. (Twice as much matter in twice the volume has the same effect.) This can be estimated by simply looking at how much stuff is out there. (Along with gravitational observations that allow us to calculate the amount of stuff that we can&#039;t see, dark matter.)

We can also check the geometry of space in essence by drawing large triangles on it; if space is curved one way or the other then the angles in a triangle whose corners are the earth and two distant points will be less or greater than 180 degrees (In the same way that they are when drawn on the surface of a ball. This allowed us to state that the universe was quite flat as (to my knowledge) we have yet to see such discrepancies.

Of course while the universe is flat today that need not remain the case in the future, a collapsing universe becomes more and more curved in on itself for example and one with &#039;dark energy&#039; also becomes more curved (in the opposite manner). This gives us a whole new scenario the &#039;big rip&#039;

We live in an interesting period in our universe&#039;s history, were we around earlier we would not have been able to discern dark energy and would assume that our universe would keep expanding, but ever slower, for eternity.]]></description>

Good point, Mark. 
I´d like to add that there are also indications that some Type Ia supernovae, such as seen in the remnants G1.9+0.3, seem to explode in an asymmetrical manner. (I saw a citation of an article of Borkowski et al., but I am not sure if it has been published so far.) This also adds to some variability to the brightness of the explosion, and means that the observed brightness depends on the perspective of the observer.
Of course, it does not mean that these events are useless, only that the variance in the processes, and therefore the &quot;error bars&quot; for deriving a distance from the observed brightness, might be larger than previously expected.]]></description>

Interesting. 
In section 6.5 they conclude that the dark energy is nothing but a cosmological constant 
I would also quote section 3.2 where they note that even small changes in model assumptions can change the Hubble constant noticeably.

:-( oh... the heavy use of fortran]]></description>
