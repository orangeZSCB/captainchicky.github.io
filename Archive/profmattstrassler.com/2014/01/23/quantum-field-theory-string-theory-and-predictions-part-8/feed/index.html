					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the link to your discussion of extra dimensional space. I was unaware of the prior tutorial. Two quick follow-ups if I may.

First, why are the Euclidean spatial dimensions seemingly unbounded (astronomical scale awareness), but the conceptual subatomic scale spatial dimensions are thought to be bounded and very uniquely shaped? Why would nature be so fickle.

Second, the &quot;time&quot; dimension can be thought of as a surrogate parameter for the cosmological motion that has been ongoing since the Big Bang, and consequently has mathematical analog to movement within the 3 spatial dimensions. As such, could the known spatial dimensions fluctuate minutely, thereby opening voids that may account for extra dimensional phenomena?]]></description>

@Wlm,

You have a point with that. 

I&#039;m not an expert on these matters, but it is my understanding that the problem that you describe is mostly significant for those events of our universe where you need to combine both QFT and GR equations to describe it, like say, the collapse of a massive star, including black holes but not limiting to them.

Besides this, the combination of QFT and GR equations might also be significant to further the study of the hierarchy problem (this is a guess of mine).

Differential geometry is a relatively new segment of mathematics, it is a rather complex subject to tackle, in particular when you consider its use to apply it to describe GR, since you have to find a way to work out how to mix and match constraints from non-euclidean spaces (the types that are useful for GR) and the physical constraints required for GR, such that it all makes sense.

Kind regards, GEN]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/01/23/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-8/#comment-171432&quot;&gt;Gastón E. Nusimovich&lt;/a&gt;.

Gaston,
Yes, you are right that Special Relativity is, by design, a subset of General Relativity.  One of Einstein&#039;s criteria when devising GR was that SR is what is obtained in the &quot;limit&quot; of zero curvature.  But it is a very proscribed subset (with a specific, constant Lorentzian metric) that does not reflect the complexities and subtleties of GR, either mathematically or geometrically. This is especially true when you have equations with derivatives based on a linear time parameter.  So basing a QFT just on SR, and not GR, has some fairly radical consequences -- like being able to write consistent QFT equations from a Hamiltonian and solve them perturbatively (or non-perturbatively), which still hasn&#039;t been accomplished for a realistic curved universe in 3+1 dimensions.

But I wrote my post because, from some comments above, some people seem to be confusing the term &quot;relativity&quot; with &quot;Einsteins&#039;s theory of gravity&quot;, when Standard Relativity (that was incorporated into QED and later QFTs) has nothing at all to do with gravity.  Hence my suggestion.

Cheers,
Wlm]]></description>

@TomA,

We could agree on the fact that the average layperson does not have the proper tools to visualize a space with any abritrary number N of dimensions, with N being any natural number larger than 4, but humans are capable of visualizing such a thing, at least any human being that also happens to be a subject matter expert.

Just as Matt has described, dimensions on any metric space are all perpendicular (&quot;orthogonal&quot; is the proper word in the jargon) to each other, so, as they have no projections on each other (they don&#039;t cast a shadow on each other), there is not a chance that they could overlap.

The molecules, atoms and particles exist in the very same space that we do, within the very same dimensions, there is no &quot;special&quot; space for atoms, particles and quantum fields.

Kind regards, GEN]]></description>

No, dimensions really means &lt;strong&gt;dimensions of space&lt;/strong&gt;.  There is no sense in which they overlap with the ones we know; they are orthogonal to ones we know, in the strict logical, mathematical and physical sense of &quot;orthognal&quot;, and in the same way that the thickness of a table adds to and is orthogonal to the surface area of a table. Read the articles in https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/extra-dimensions/ .  These dimensions are not some abstract concept; these are directions into which sufficiently small or sufficiently free objects can really move, do dances, pirouettes, and all the things you can do in the diemnsions we know.  In particular, an object that moves in the direction of one of those dimensions has motion-energy, just as objects that move along one of the dimensions we&#039;re used to -- with an analogous Einsteinian formula relating energy, momentum and mass.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just a quick question relating to the meaning &quot;dimensions&quot; in this context.

It seems to me that there are at least two possible conceptions of the idea that there may more than 3 spacial dimensions.

The first is that we (as human thinkers) lack the intuitive ability to visualize space in more than 3 spacial dimensions, and therefore develop confusing analogies or rationalizations which imply validity and justification.

The second is that all spacial dimensions in excess of the 3 Euclidean dimensions simply overlap with the original 3, but we treat them differently because the math is easier within the context of the newly envisioned space. Another way to say this is that atomic space overlaps astronomical space, but you cannot efficiently use astronomical math to solve problems in atomic space, so a new thought paradigm is necessary. In this sense, the term &quot;dimension&quot; would really mean parameter.]]></description>
