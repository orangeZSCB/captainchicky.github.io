					<description><![CDATA[Hi Prof. Matt Strassler,
I am watching your GGI lectures online(youtube) and I love the way you present those collider physics material in an new angle. Thank you for those wonderful lectures!!

I notice that you use quite a bit slides to illustrate the real life cases, mostly graphs from LHC. However, the videos online did not tape those slides. After some search on the GGI2014 website, I still cannot find those slides. If by any chance that you still have those slides, would you mind to share a link with us?

Thank you so much and wish you all the best,
TC]]></description>
