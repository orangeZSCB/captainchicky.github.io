					<description><![CDATA[First off, thank you for what you are doing in making science knowledge more accessible to more people!  
Jupiter has been a gem up there this year.  Every night when I am out imaging it I think about the excitement Galileo must have had seeing Jupiter&#039;s moons for the first time.  I get excited every time and I know they are supposed to be there!  I agree, get out and look up!  Wonders await!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Magnificent picture! The glory of centuries of civilization embracing the glory of the eons. Nothing like the ancient to question the future.

BTW, there are apps for smart phones that show all the interesting objects out there, from Capella, to Aldebaran and Beltegeuse. I can now spot quickly Andromeda, and Uranus, so I feel much more at home!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice post and photo. By a cool coincidence last night while on a honeymoon vacation in Las Vegas I also took a picture quite similar to yours. Mine has the smaller version of the Eiffel Tower on one side and the beautiful Paris Hotel on the other with Jupiter above and to the left (about 45 degrees) of the full moon and both between the two structures. Taken with an iPod touch 5G Jupiter is more bright in my image. I&#039;d like to share here but I don&#039;t know how to do that without posting it somewhere else and then providing a link.]]></description>
