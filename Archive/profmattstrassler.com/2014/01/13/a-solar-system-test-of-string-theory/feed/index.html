I have spent some significant fraction of my time --- not half, but not a tenth either --- using string theory to get &quot;physical answers to physical questions.&quot;  Instead of sleeping, perhaps you might enjoy reading more of my papers... since it would appear that there are applications of string theory to real-world questions of which you are unaware.  

Meanwhile, your remark &quot;Its `Theory of Everything&#039; explains everything except the standard model, that is, everything except our universe&quot; is, to my ear, bizarre.  Currently, string theory doesn&#039;t explain anything at all, so what are you talking about?  String theory is very useful as a tool for answering important quantum field theory questions for which there are no other methods, but it doesn&#039;t *explain* anything. What do you in fact mean by this strange remark?  Or is it merely political grousing?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Please wake me up when string theory predicts anything definite. Its  &quot;Theory of Everything&quot; explains everything except the standard model, that is, everything except our Universe. Many stringers I met said they now do mathematics, but they do this on physics resources. When do we stop this random walking in Hilbert space and go back to physics: physical answers to physical questions?]]></description>

Sorry to be tardy replying, Dino.

We&#039;ll have to agree to differ on this I&#039;m afraid. I see the equivalence principle as something like the scaffolding used to build GR rather than a foundation stone.]]></description>

John,

You note: “I’m not even sure that it tests general relativity.”

The fact that the equivalence principle holds over a tiny area of space is a technicality based on the simple fact that the gravitational field lines produced by a sphere (like the Earth) diverge with distance, so that two objects dropped in an elevator at rest on the Earth will hit the floor slightly closer together than two objects dropped in a uniformly accelerating elevator in deep space.

However, that misses the point: As Matt noted: “the equivalence principle, a foundation stone of Einstein’s theory of gravity, which implies that all objects, no matter what material they are made of and no matter how heavy they are, will be pulled by gravity in the same way… with the same acceleration.”

Thus testing the Equivalence Principle is a perfectly valid test of General Relativity.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The scale of the solar system is too small to resolve these issues.
So too, most probably,  is the local galaxy.

An article in the January 4th edition of &quot;New Scientist&quot; suggested that it might be possible use observations of Gamma-Ray Burst GRB 130427A to test models of spacetime, incuding Special Relativity, String theory and Loop Quantum Gravity.

A record-breaking Burst from this source was observed by the Fermi-Lat space telescope last April and has raised serious theoretical questions.

None of the current models for GRB production can explain the behaviour of the emissions during the first pulse of this burst, or the fact that photons in the GeV scale were still being counted  9 hours later.  

Giovanni Amelino-Camelia and his collaborators wrote a paper in May 2013, which suggested that the observations might be evidence of a quantum spacetime which deviates from the predictions of Special Relativity. 
http://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.2626v2.pdf  

This assumes that all the gamma rays were initially emitted simultaneously.

But, as the New Scientist article by Stuart Clark points out,  Amelino_Carmelia  &quot;has banned his team from investigating which, if any, ot these theories is closest to the mark&quot;
It concludes that further observations are needed, particularly of the behaviour of  extra-galactic neutrinos.]]></description>
