Is there a reason why my comment is locked in perpetual awaiting moderation? Are my sources not valid? Did my post have a glaring error?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;But it will be decades before we have enough data to tell whether, in fact, the rare events of which we have so few examples really are more or less common than they used to be.&quot;

Well, probably not so long. There exist  in fact some evidence pointing to an increase of frecuency (and maybe of intensity) of at least some extreme events. See

					<description><![CDATA[As a Meteorologist of some 30 years I chafe at anecdotal cold snaps as being indicative of anything.   The first thing to keep in mind is the diverse nature of atmospheric physics.

And the computer models can be an enigma.  First of all forecasters need to be competent.  In assessing any atmospheric state a little common sense is in order.   It baffles me that such elementary issues are overlooked.   In my experience go for what seems logical and contest it.   Eliminating far-flung ideas from the pragmatic.   KISS is a pretty good tact when looking at weather patterns and weather forecasts.

A good Meteorologists hate goof balls who are not real forecasters but people who report the weather.   Any DJ can do a reasonable job at that.

Both sides right and left go political with weather and climate and most deductions are empirical but hardly useful in relation to the overall physical dynamics of weather.    Highs,  Lows,  are pretty basic but gravity waves,  vorticity and climate types are nuanced and challenge every forecaster,  if they do not suck..

But to the point at hand.   Naming the Polar Vortex is like selling a fancy name for a brake system on a car.   Power-assisted, anti-lock is reassuring but it is really just a sales gimmick.  Likewise this debate over vortices.

In actuality we are talking about a Jet Stream with high amplitude that smashes into the southern states while Miller B Climate types spawn cyclogenesis and resulting major events like cold snaps,  snow storms and convective activity.

In short most novices are ill-informed.   The empirical observations are merely incidents with no real intrinsic value except in the long term sense.
