					<description><![CDATA[In some theories the universe looks ringing like a bell or something. Such a theories really exist due to presence of spherical modes of CMBR. But the CMBR is noisy and you can see a dodecahedron in it too. One distribution violates the another one, so you can observe both but just in impure state only. IMO it&#039;s because at the extreme distance scales the time and space dimensions are blurred mutually and the Universe behaves like mixture of transverse and longitudinal waves, i.e. the spherical surface ripples and gravitational waves, which undergo particle packing geometry like the foam. Just the dodecahedron mode of CMBR therefore corresponds the gravitational waves, which the BICEP2 and Planck cooperation looked for. In this sense we observed these gravitational waves already before some time in COBE/WMAP data. Once these modes don&#039;t fit the E8 Lie group geometry, then it&#039;s evident, they do contain some transverse component and as such they cannot represent a pure B-mode or gravitational waves. The Lie group essentially describes the tightest packing of hyperspheres, formed with exchanging of energy between itself.

One of problem with BICEP2 signals, it should be the more intensive, the more distant is and therefore &quot;reddish&quot;. But the BICEP2 signal exhibits a a blue tilt - i.e. its formed with something, which was created AFTER deionization, not BEFORE it. If we admit, that the &quot;gravitational waves&quot; searched are the dodecahedral mode of CMBR fluctuations, then everything looks OK, because just this mode represents the largest structures observable on the sky. But such large structures cannot be observed with tiny sampling window of BICEP2 polar observatory reliably. 

So in brief: what the BICEP2 is looking for is the dodecahedron mode of CMBR and the background is formed with dark matter filaments between galaxies and it should be subtracted from signal too.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What the BICEP2 cooperation is still missing is the structure of dark matter fibers  across the whole sky. The dark matter background AROUND galaxies was indeed filtered out from data, but the fibers BETWEEN galaxies were not. The dust background implies, that the background signal will disappear when we look at &quot;proper&quot; spot of the sky (from technical reasons the BICEP2 scanned only narrow region around south pole). But IMO this background is systematical, quite intensive and it essentially blurs the option, that we could ever observe the primordial gravitational waves before inflation.

Dark matter fibers were already observed independently (1, 2). There is no apparent reason, why not to account them into background data of BICEP2. The watching of isolated narrow spots on they sky from the Earth is a cheap technology, but it isn&#039;t the most systematical/effective way, how to do it. The astronomers therefore have to wait for Planck polarization data, once they will be released. The signal of true gravitational waves should shrink with increasing frequency, the background signal of dark matter filaments will expand with increasing frequency of radiation used for observation. In this way both signals could be separated computationally with FFT analysis of the spectra. The tiny localized spot of BICEP2 is a nice technological achievement, but the amount of data provided is not sufficient for reliable analysis of CMBR spectra.]]></description>

TomH:- Like Strasser, Steinhardt is way behind the times. It was known as soon as the BICEP2 team report materialised that they had no CMB detections. In fact, it was known long before their report materialised that they would never make any CMB detections. Strasser and Steinhardt are either ignorant of the reports made long before them, or are otherwise failing to acknowledge them. Certainly they both now know about them, as does the BICEP2 team. But, as usual, silence is apparently golden.

					<description><![CDATA[Some harsh critique of BICEP2 hype,  and the inflationary paradigm in general, by Paul Steinhardt:
www.nature.com/news/big-bang-blunder-bursts-the-multiverse-bubble-1.15346

Steinhardt&#039;s final conclusion? :
&quot; ... it is clear that the inflationary paradigm is fundamentally untestable, and hence scientifically meaningless. ... &quot;

Mainly because inflationary paradigm leads to untestable and/or unobservable &quot;multiverses&quot; (my understanding of his article).]]></description>
