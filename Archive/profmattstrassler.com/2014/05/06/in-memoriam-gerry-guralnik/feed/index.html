Thank you Mr Kudzu, my knowledge is not enough to argue with you or Professor Strassler. My analogy of &quot;me and my reflection&quot; is only a kid&#039;s understanding of reality and mathematical models. It may like the difference between relativity and quantum mechanics. Crippling weak gauge foce but not electromagnetic gauge force - not of direct scientific context.  
The underline is, &quot;At some point in the fall of 1967, I think while driving to my office at M.I.T., it occurred to me that I had been applying the right ideas to the wrong problem&quot; - .Weinberg. 

I can understand a little, gauge symmetry, degrees of freedom, and polarizations here......   http://www.quantumdiaries.org/2011/10/10/who-ate-the-higgs/]]></description>

The photon is massless because it has no &#039;Higgs component&#039; Seven particles are mixed to create four new particles. The starting seven are the W1, W2 and W3 isospin particles, the B isocharge particle and H+, H- and H0; the three massless Higgs bosons. Any particle that is part massless Higgs boson will be heavy. (he reasons for this are complicated.)

The W1 and W2 mix with the H+ and H- to become W+ and W-. Because they have a  &#039;Higgs component&#039; they are heavy.

The W3 and H0 cannot mix simply, instead the W3 H0 AND B particle must all mix into one, the Z. Because it has a  &#039;Higgs component&#039; it is heavy.

But this leaves a little something left over, part W3 and part B particle, this is the photon. It has no  &#039;Higgs component&#039; so it is massless, just like all the other bosons (Gravitons, gluons).

The Higgs mechanism is not like you and your reflection. It is not one massless particle\field that is affected but both together, equally. Imagine you and me in a room. We can both move quite fast, running about independently. Now imagine Professor Higgs comes in and ties us together with rope. Now we cannot move independently, if one wants to move, BOTH must move together. If we are not tightly tied this isn&#039;t too bad, but if we are tied very tightly, if our arms are tied together and our legs, even our heads, then things become very hard for us. Quite likely we will just fall on he floor and be stuck. If we wanted to move we would have to do so very slowly, talking to each other so we know what we are doing. This is more like how the higgs mechanism works.

Finally measuring and consciousness are distinguishable; anything can measure. A speck of dust a single photon. The universe measures itself all the time. (Otherwise things get tricky. If my big toe measures something but I don&#039;t consciously know it, is that a measurement? What if my shoe does? Where is the boundary between conscious, measuring me and the not conscious, being measured rest of the universe?)]]></description>

Sorry, but a new and better video came out on the cosmic web simulation which I like to share with you and your readers. The narrator describes as &quot;branches of a tree&quot;, well I see it as like neurons in our brain. 

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VS8sPPFwdWA

Another question that strikes me watching this simulation, assuming it is accurate, is that inflation or that initial expansion of &quot;space&quot; must of happened faster than the speed of light in order to create a non-uniformity of matter (whether dark and/or light). So, space is not constrained to the limit c. Hence, could there be regions between the clusters that are &quot;empty&quot;, below ZPE, absolute zero energy?]]></description>

Answer to all your question marks could very well be yes. I apologies if my remarks led you to think I perceived the Higgs as the most important of all the &quot;particles&quot; nor do I think the person who came up with the phrase &quot;God&#039;s particle&quot; does so either. I think he was just making a general statement of the fact that we finally have some concrete understanding of who matter is created. I must emphasize the distinction between matter (fermions) and light (bosons). I am saying it is the matter that gives the universe structure (the filaments we see and are a part of). So this structure, this magnificent web, is made up of all that you have listed above. Simply, the Higgs particle surfaced first and some one grabbed it for a profit, :-) 

And it is this structure that could very well create a consciousness, just like our nervous system created our consciousness. So, my logic is, if our consciousness makes us &quot;human&quot;, intelligent animals enough to figure out our universe, then think of what this monumental structure can accomplice, i.e. God-like. I argue, it is extremely similar to our nervous system in our brain, both physically and functionally, so it could very well be possible. 

The obvious argument people use to refute this idea is, then what created the universe, the causality argument. I say nothing, nothing created the universe, because it always exist. Of course at different phases and maybe cyclic but it need not be cyclic as one phases out another pops out and who knows we maybe in a soup of multiple universes all popping in and out, now. NOW! ... only the now exist and it is us who embedded time just for convenience.

I ask you, how could there not be a God?]]></description>

Higgs mechanism: The Higgs field doesn’t ‘stabilize’ rest mass, it *causes* it. 
Electroweak symmetry breaking: It does not unite the weak and electromagnetic forces; instead it MAKES them from two totally different forces (Isocharge and isospin).

I understand, &quot;In two massless fields, one is destabilize by Higgs mechanism&quot;. A gauge field could give a particle, but it will be &quot;massless&quot; like photon. This means “gauge invariance (bosons) can get rest mass through Higgs mechanism”. But why photons are &quot;rest massless&quot; ?

Once I had an unanswered question during my school days in 7th standard, &quot;why my image in the mirror is not me&quot; ?
Because it does what I do - means a stable wave in one creates a stable wave in the other. 
At the sametime, I can move a pencil but my mirror image cannot on its own - means the stable wave in one, not creates a stable wave in the other, requires ‘extra’ energy  to move a pencil. 
How can we say Higgs mechanism created this difference(non zero) - preventing the annihilation ? - measuring consciousness is meaningless - measuring and consciousness is indistinguishable. 

I could not see my own eyes (I could not measure my CONSCIOUSNESS with my consciousness), so I need a &quot;MODEL (standard)&quot; as a mirror image to see my eyes. 
But I have &quot;mass&quot; to move a pencil, my model (or wave function) as a mirror image have not. How could I make my mirror image to move a pencil on its own, through Higgs mechanism ? 

Unless there is some difference like quantum entanglement, and also if one of them is crippled ?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The steam engine was not invented by one single person. It certainly was not invented by James Watt, he merely refined the idea into a practical machine.
