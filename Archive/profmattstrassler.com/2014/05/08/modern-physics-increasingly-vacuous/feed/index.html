Oh no, you asked about &#039;the empty space we know&#039;; if the vacuum were exotic because the value of the Higgs field in it was different then the electron&#039;s mass would be different because the Higgs field affects that mass.

But it would be predictably different. If the Higgs vev were twice as large then the electron&#039;s mass would be twice as large. (On the other hand if the vacuum was exotic for a non Higgs reason the electron&#039;s mass should be the same.)

At present we can say the electron&#039;s mass is 2077eV per GeV of Higgs vev. But WHY is it 2077? That we don&#039;t yet know. We haven&#039;t discovered any reason that it should be that, but we know *something* has kept it at pretty much exactly that value from the start of the universe.]]></description>

If you are right, it apparantly does not matter whether the empty space is exotic or not. So, if in both empty spaces an electron&#039;s mass would be much larger than the ones we know, then what is the issue?]]></description>

This is actually a very deep question. Initially we had to ask &#039;Why do particles have the masses they do?&#039; because we had no reason. To explain this we invoked the Higgs mechanism which tells us that the mass of a particle depends on how strongly it couples with the Higgs field. So the answer to your question would be &#039;Because in the space we know the Higgs field has a certain value and the electron couples to it.&#039;

But that just moves the question back a step; now we must ask &#039;Why do  particles have the specific values of coupling constants that they do? We know electrons have had their current mass as far back as we can see and we know how it comes about, but we don&#039;t know why they have the specific mass they do.]]></description>

You know, I was being slightly facetious when I posted this question, but the replies have been fascinating!  Not only have I learned about the etymology of the words vacuum, octopus, and penis; but reading physicists taking shots at each other is highly entertaining!]]></description>

Octopus isn&#039;t Latin, so Latin plurals would be wrong. Personally I prefer to treat it as English, as &quot;octopodes&quot; (apparently the correct Greek version) just doesn&#039;t seem right to me.]]></description>

Real particles have a specific (range of) energy\wavelength that repeats periodically in an orderly fashion. As such there are certain things they cannot do, their energy cannot become zero (or many other values) nor can they dissipate into other fields. (Though they will make their mark in all fields they are connected to.)

Virtual particles by contrast do not have a fixed energy or regular wavelength. They lack the order needed to not fall apart. In some sense they may be considered not separate particles at all but just part of the background wiggle of fields. They mix with other ripples, split apart or are absorbed into the ripples of connected fields.

One of the easiest modes of decay to imagine is splitting apart. A real electron moving at speed x is stable. It moves at a constant speed determined by its energy.

A virtual electron however has no specific energy. The bits of it with low energy move slower and the bits of it with high energy faster. As it moves then it will quickly &#039;spread out&#039; as the faster bits leave the slower bits behind.]]></description>
