					<description><![CDATA[http://physics.aps.org/articles/v8/6
Everyday experience tells us that big objects—eggs and humans—do not appear to exist in a superposition of states like that possible for more quantum objects, such as electrons. Does this mean quantum physics fundamentally doesn’t apply to objects beyond a certain size? A new experiment that allows the motion of a large atom in an optical lattice to be tracked could help in the search for a size cutoff. Using this setup, Carsten Robens at the University of Bonn, Germany, and his colleagues demonstrated that a cesium atom travels in a truly nonclassical fashion, moving as a quantum superposition of states and thus occupying more than one distinct location at a time. Larger objects have been observed to have such inherently quantum properties, but the observation of Robens et al. is based on a stringent test considered to be the gold standard for confirming that a superposition exists. As such, their experiment constrains theories of physics that aim to replace quantum mechanics. Their technique could also be used to test superpositions on even more macroscopic scales, such as with larger atoms or molecules.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post, a topic I&#039;ve often wondered about.
 Re &quot;so that ....if we don’t find them, we’ll be confident we did a thorough search and didn’t just miss one for lack of trying&quot;....
Owa, I imagine that&#039;s the hard hard part. Searching for a needle in a haystack full of needles is bad enough, but if you&#039;re not sure what the &#039;needle&#039; looks like....Even the simplest of experiments get complicated when you try to extract limits of detection for objects with vague properties...as always, I&#039;m filled with admiration for the particle physicists..]]></description>

Thanks for the reply kudzu. 
So the idea of a Planck scale bounce in a collapse isn&#039;t so crazy. Yes my take is a singularity is only a mathematical entity until quantum gravity is worked out? (An infinity that will be tamed like the UV catastrophe was). 

Thanks for the link also.]]></description>

The lack of electromagetnic and strong nuclear interactions means you can&#039;t detect the particle while it is &quot;alive&quot;; i.e., is traveling and hasn&#039;t decayed.  Neutrinos are like this (while neutrons are not.)  

The long lifetime means that when it &quot;dies&quot;, i.e. falls apart into other things, you have to be ready for its decay products at a macroscopic and random distance from where you created it. That&#039;s no problem as long as (a) some of its decay products have electromagnetic or strong nuclear interactions, (b) the decay occurs inside your detector somewhere, and (c) your detector design allows you to find particles that appear at random places inside your detector.

So a particle of this type can only be seen when it dies, not while it is alive.  If its death occurs right away, no problem; the particles from its decay come from the collision point and your detector (and trigger) is ready for that.  Its when death occurs late that you have a problem.

Of course if death occurs after the long-lived particle has traveled a hundred miles, your detector won&#039;t see it.  Then, your indication that it is present is that you will see that something detected appears to be recoiling against something undetected.  In the case of Figure 1 and 2, if the X lifetime allowed it to travel a kilometer, the event would have a single jet recoiling against ... apparently nothing.  Unfortunately, that happens a lot with known particles (neutrinos!) so it&#039;s not a distinctive enough signature for an easy discovery.  People do try though: http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.1344]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Back in the day when bubble chambers were used as &quot;detectors&quot;, neutrino interactions with other particles showed up in very distinct ways: &quot;inbalanced&quot; set of contrails, to start with, there was mass/energy missing from the picture.

These bubble chambers that involve neutrino interactions are still very interesting.

Kind regards, GEN]]></description>

Long lifetimes aren&#039;t really a barrier to detection, (Short ones however...) but interactions are. Consider neutrinos, which are stable but exceedingly difficult to detect due to only interacting via the weak force.

However if you are able to record  the creation event of a particle you can detect it by what is missing when comparing &#039;before&#039; and &#039;after&#039;. This is how the neutrino was discovered. (Actually how it was proposed, long, long before it was even detected directly.); when looking at beta decays it seemed as if some invisible, undetectable thing was whizzing away taking variable amounts of energy with it.]]></description>
