Sorry, if the moon just all of a sudden disappeared, there would be 50 foot tsunamis as the water surged towards the gravitational pull of the sun. After that they would settle down to lower tides than we have today. The overall impact of no moon, however, would dramatically change everything we know about our planet today.]]></description>

OK, I now stand uncorrected. :) I found my source regarding the moon. It is the series &quot;The Universe&quot;, S4/E02, &quot;The Day the Moon Was Gone&quot;. It says we would have 50 foot tides and that the Earth&#039;s tilt would gyrate greatly, like Mars, affecting climate, currents, etc.
Why it predicts such high tides when other sources do not, I do not know.......but there you go.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I seem to stand corrected. I can&#039;t find anything saying the tides would get huge if there were no moon. Everything says the tides would be less extreme. I might have been having a senior moment.....  :)
I&#039;ll keep looking, though.....
I do love that mooooon!]]></description>

Ok,  I do believe the moon has been a great allie to the  evolution of life here on Earth. But I did not think, and have not heard of it been that detrimental to stable ocean tides.. There are ofcoarse theories of the moon only recently been captured by the earth, but I don&#039;t really want to go into them arguments here. 

However it is quite amazing the sun, moon and earth relationship.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think it involved the wobble of the Earth, too. If there were no moon the Earth would wobble more than it does now. This would create a sloshing of the oceans? I&#039;ll do some research and see if I can find it. I&#039;m terrible about remembering where I learn stuff. If I ever had to footnote I&#039;d be lost.]]></description>

HI Cass,

Where did you get the theory that the Earth without the moon, would cause the suns gravitational influence on the ocean to be as you stated above?]]></description>
