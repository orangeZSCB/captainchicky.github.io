					<description><![CDATA[Just wondering… When I was there in 1984 (W/Z) the cafeteria had a line down it showing the Swiss side and the French side.  Is the cafeteria in the same place?

					<description><![CDATA[It by the end of 1915 (that&#039;s an entire century ago!), Albert Einstein figured out how wrong Newton was about gravity.

It&#039;s been an entire century that we all have known that Newton&#039;s mechanics are not THE explanation for gravity, but we still use it within the domain that we know that it can make &quot;good enough&quot; predictions: most of our own civilization is built on a theory that we know that is not perfect, but it still works.

I would not be so reckless about any premature &quot;uselessness&quot; of either SuperSymmetry or the Standard Model, not just yest.

Kind regards, GEN]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just a pointed question regarding triggering:

It is my understanding that triggering, besides the important aspect of persisting (saving) pertinent information on certain measurements, it also involves a certain kind filtering of what events you care to capture data on (and to avoid those events that are not interesting for your current search), so, with triggering, your data gathering process &quot;subscribes&quot; to certain kinds of events only.

Is that correct?

Kind regards, GEN]]></description>
