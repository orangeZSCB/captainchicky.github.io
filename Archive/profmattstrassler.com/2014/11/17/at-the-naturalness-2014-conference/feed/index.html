Our Universe is a larger version of a galactic polar jet.

It&#039;s not the Big Bang; it&#039;s the Big Ongoing.

Dark energy is dark matter continuously emitted into the Universal jet.]]></description>

In nature there seems to be no phenomena that is totally unique. (Things happen again and again in accordance with physical laws.) I see no reason that BB should be a special exception to this. The mechanism that caused it is likely part of a larger construct that can not just produce a single BB, but many. (just like every other construct in nature) I&#039;m glad to hear that others share the view of an infinite cosmos, I certainly don&#039;t have the credentials to personally champion such an endeavor.

If it would be easier to start over with an infinite foundation instead of nothingness then why not do it? (There is no evidence of nothingness after all, so why is it the default foundation?) Is it just mathematically &quot;purer&quot;, some legacy of history or mathematics, a difference in mental architecture?; in my mind it&#039;s just an assumption, that could just as easily be replaced with the assumption of infinity.

It&#039;s wonderful to see science/math at a level where it&#039;s almost crossing over into philosophy ;-) Interesting times ahead.

Infinity contains us by default. Oblivion doesn&#039;t contain anything and never can contain anything, so why would it be our beginning? I&#039;m sure formlessness is all well and good for zen meditation, but it&#039;s utterly useless for math and astrophysics.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Immanuel Kant said, &quot;Two things inspire me to awe: the starry heavens above and the moral universe within&quot; (Critique of Pure Reason).  He promoted the idea that the universe was infinite because time was infinite (having an infinite past and future - Immortality of soul) and the universe existed in the time space dimension.   Stephen Hawking says that for Kant and just about everyone else in that period, time was absolute, it was the backdrop to everything.   Einstein&#039;s Theory of Relativity changed that.

 A Finite Universe:  
In 1915, Einstein&#039;s Theory of Relativity said that space and time were no longer Absolute.  Instead of being a fixed backdrop to everything that happened in the universe, they were dynamically shaped by the matter and energy contained in the universe.

There is infinite universe, but Finite universe (Mortality) is only relative. Humans experience mortality - so live in unnatural finite universe. The infinite universal is natural. Mathematics governs material. Total artificial intelligence wil eliminate humans ?]]></description>

Kudzu,

I would agree with your logic concerning alien life. Just going by statistics does not make the case. We still just have only one example of life and until we find others any claims we might make on a statistical basis are suspect.

With regard to your assertion that:  “The search for a mechanism behind the equivalence (or possible lack of it) is a pressing problem in physics.” Perhaps. I would agree based on standard and ever more precise tests of the Equivalence Principle utilizing ordinary matter. However, the situation with regard to antimatter has been abysmal.
 
An experiment by Fairbank and Witteborn almost 50 years ago (no typo; 50 not 5) indicated that free electrons fell at the expected rate. Yet, (almost unbelievably) the experiment was never repeated using positrons, which was its original intent!
 
In the late 1980’s a proposal to test the gravitational acceleration of antiprotons died for lack of funding.

The 2013 Alpha experiment you cite was literally an afterthought – utilizing data accumulated in the course of Antihydrogen confinement at CERN. The determination that if antihydrogen falls up it does so at &#060; 65g does not of course disprove the possibility that antihydrogen falls up at 1g.

Sorry, I don’t call a half-century of NOT doing something “trying”.

However, I will say that the up-coming AEgIS experiment (2016?) finally qualifies! Time will tell…

As to Protons and Neutrons being loaded with anti-up and anti-down quarks. Perhaps. However, if antihydrogen falls up, the onus will be on those who insist on &#039;antimatter within matter&#039; not those who proposed gravitational repulsion.]]></description>

No, you aren&#039;t the only one who thinks a finite model of the universe is not satisfactory. The Big Bang beginning has been attacked by some scientists as a creationist model with the creation moved from an unacceptable 6,000 years ago to an acceptable 14 billion years ago. 

Some BB theory supporters speculate that there could have been an infinite series of Big Bangs but that is just speculation without any evidence at all and just something to counter the argument that the BB is a type of creationist model. I think the popularity of the BB theory has to do primarily with our religious/cultural tradition of a universe with a beginning. There are just so many things wrong with the BB theory / expanding universe model. It is just so incredible, one of the most incredible myths man has invented. It has fostered arguments that the universe is finely tuned and is unnatural in the sense of the subject of this thread. Indeed, if we could start over, start with the premise of infinity, we could eliminate much of what is wrong with cosmology and theoretical physics in my opinion.]]></description>

Adam, I think you are new to Dr. Strassler&#039;s blog. Because he is very busy he generally does not respond to (he may not even read) comments after the first couple days of a posting.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Greetings Prof Matt Strassler, thank you for writing this blog, i find it an interesting and entertaining read. My background is in software engineering, but i do love reading up on physics and math too, I was wondering if there were any models that just assumed infinity as a basis, and from those extrapolated up to things like geometry, math, multiverse, physics, instead of the standard approach of what i would term &quot;drilling down&quot;, trying to obtain higher and higher &quot;resolution&quot; of reality? It seems like current math thinking is to shun infinity as an absurd possibility (casual diamond). All reason is based on assumptions, that true is true, that false is false, that true is an inversion of false and vise versa. why not also assume infinity as a start too? i don&#039;t contened that it makes more reasonable sense for oblivion to be a foundation because it&#039;s impossible to reasonably believe in something that can never be observed (no evidence). Infinity is much more likely than oblivion as a foundation. I would be very interested to hear your thoughts on this. Regards, Adam.]]></description>
