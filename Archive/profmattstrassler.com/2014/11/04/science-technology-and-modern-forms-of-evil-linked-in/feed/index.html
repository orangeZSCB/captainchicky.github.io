					<description><![CDATA[Hi would you mind letting me know which hosting company you&#039;re working with?
I&#039;ve loaded your blog in 3 completely different browsers and 
I must say this blog loads a lot faster then most. Can you recommend a 
good web hosting provider at a fair price? Cheers, I appreciate 
it!]]></description>

&quot;[I] Hope the CIA is working on a more secure web [that] decent folk can use. &quot;
I TORtally agree.  Eepsite, a typo, I swear!  And again!  They&#039;re just going FREEly over the NET today.  Seriously though, I&#039;m thinking of terms like &#039;hearts and minds&#039; and &#039;social engineering&#039; and marketing and PR &#039;spin&#039; and &#039;Sybil attack&#039;.  It is kind of neat how a web-of-trust can be combined with privacy, if you&#039;re willing to live with the low transfer rates.

This is no big shock.  I&#039;ve known this for years, like several of the people here.  You just happen to have been slow to become a victim or hear of it (like I did by noticing that my friend was sending spam to me about LI).  I don&#039;t even know _how_ I got an Linked-In account but sure as the world I found one when looking for it and it had some of my (business/personal) friends.  I assume it was just waiting there as a placeholder for me to sign up.  I feel like I&#039;m wasting my breath when I tell relatives to not put each other&#039;s phone numbers (including mine) into their FB/Myspace/etc. profiles.  A creditor or 2 recently got into some hot water for calling entire families and circles of friends and even employers over a debt.   I guess they were hoping that someone would get tired of hearing it and pay to make it go away (LOL, just kidding - I hope), or that it would embarrass the debtors (assuming they even got the right person&#039;s friends and family).

You ever wonder why Google and the like want your cell phone number (no landlines [SMS-less] allowed!) to &#039;secure&#039; your email and got rid of even &#039;fake&#039; security questions as an option?  It&#039;s a mighty useful tool to them in many ways.  I&#039;m sure the initial thinking was for spammers but it become optional, and then there was the accounts stolen by guessing information that all your relatives already know and that others can _buy_ in bulk.  The advertising identity is just icing on the cake.  They wanted to solve several headaches AND get a new revenue stream all in one go.]]></description>
