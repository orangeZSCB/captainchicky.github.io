										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m busy dealing with the challenges of being in a quantum superposition, but you&#8217;ve probably heard: <a href="http://journals.aps.org/prl/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.112.241101" target="_blank">BICEP2&#8217;s paper is now published</a>, with some of <a title="BICEP2: New Evidence Of Cosmic Inflation!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/bicep2-new-evidence-of-cosmic-inflation/" target="_blank">its implicit and explicit claims</a> watered down after external and internal review. The bottom line is <a title="Will BICEP2 Lose Some of Its Muscle?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/05/19/will-bicep2-lose-some-of-its-muscle/" target="_blank">as I discussed a few weeks ago</a> when I described the criticism of the interpretation of their work (see also <a title="The BICEP2 Dust-Up Continues" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/05/30/the-bicep2-dust-up-continues/" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>
<ul>
<li>There is relatively little doubt (but it still requires confirmation by another experiment!) that BICEP2 has observed interesting polarization of the <a title="Which Parts of the Big Bang Theory are Reliable, and Why?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/26/which-parts-of-the-big-bang-theory-are-reliable/" target="_blank">cosmic microwave background</a> <em>(specifically: B-mode polarization that is <strong>not</strong> from gravitational lensing of E-mode polarization; <a title="A Primer On Today’s Events" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/a-primer-on-todays-events/" target="_blank">see here for more</a> about what BICEP2 measured)</em></li>
<li>But no one, including BICEP2, can say for sure whether it is due to ancient <a title="Did BICEP2 Detect Gravitational Waves Directly or Indirectly?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/04/30/did-bicep2-detect-gravitational-waves-directly-or-indirectly/" target="_blank">gravitational wave</a>s from <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">cosmic inflation</a>, or to <a title="Will BICEP2 Lose Some of Its Muscle?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/05/19/will-bicep2-lose-some-of-its-muscle/" target="_blank">polarized dust in the galaxy</a>, or to a mix of the two; and the BICEP2 folks are explicitly less certain about this, in the current version of their paper, than in their original implicit and explicit statements.</li>
</ul>
<p>And we won&#8217;t know whether it&#8217;s all just dust until there&#8217;s more data, which should start to show up in coming months, from BICEP2 itself, from Planck, and from other sources. However, be warned: the measurements of the very faint dust that might be present in BICEP2&#8217;s region of the sky are extremely difficult, and the new data might not be immediately convincing. To come to a consensus might take a few years rather than a few months.  Be patient; the process of science, being self-correcting, will eventually get it straight, but not if you rush it.</p>
<p>Sorry I haven&#8217;t time to say more right now.</p>

<p>Two papers this week (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1405.5857" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.7351" target="_blank">here</a>) gave more detailed voice to <a title="Will BICEP2 Lose Some of Its Muscle?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/05/19/will-bicep2-lose-some-of-its-muscle/" target="_blank">the opinion that the BICEP2 team may have systematically underestimated the possible impact of polarized dust</a> on their measurement.  These papers raise (but cannot settle) the question as to whether the B-mode polarization seen by BICEP2 might be entirely due to this dust &#8212; dust which is found throughout our galaxy, but is rather tenuous in the direction of the sky in which BICEP2 was looking.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to drag my readers into the mud of the current discussion, both because it&#8217;s very technical and because it&#8217;s rather vague and highly speculative. Even the authors of the two papers admit they leave the situation completely unsettled.  But to summarize, the main purpose and effect of these papers seems to be this:</p>
<p><span id="more-7706"></span></p>
<ol>
<li>to point out that the level to which dust tends to be polarized, as measured by <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0871" target="_blank">the Planck satellite team in their very recent paper</a>, is larger than most people expected: twice as large, or more, than assumed by BICEP2 in some of their arguments;</li>
<li>to remind us that the effect of the dust on the BICEP2 polarization signal increases like the <strong><em>square</em></strong> of the dust polarization &#8212; i.e., a <em>doubling</em> of the dust polarization means a <em>quadrupling</em> of the contribution of the dust to BICEP2&#8217;s measurement;</li>
<li>to try to convince us that the uncertainties about dust are currently too large for anyone to draw conclusions as to the meaning of BICEP2&#8217;s measurement &#8212; as to whether it is due to gravitational waves, to polarized dust, or to a combination of the two <em>[along with small effects from synchrotron radiation and from gravitational lensing of E-mode polarization of the cosmic microwave background]</em>;</li>
<li>to note that new measurements relevant for determining the dust effect are on their way on the 6 to 12 month timescale, so these issues may soon be resolved &#8212; although it may not be so easy, because <em>precise</em> determinations of the dust polarization, and proper combination of measurements by different experiments, will be needed for an unambiguous measurement of any gravitational wave contribution to BICEP2&#8217;s B-mode polarization.</li>
</ol>
<p>Regarding the last point, the most important measurements in question will come</p>
<ul>
<li>from the BICEP2 team itself, whose next-generation experiment KECK, already running, is basically five BICEP2&#8217;s in tandem, and will cover two different microwave frequencies, and</li>
<li>from <a title="The Universe According to Planck (The Satellite)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/03/21/the-universe-according-to-planck-the-satellite/" target="_blank">the Planck satellite</a> at a range of frequencies.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both papers make some basic points that undermine confidence in BICEP2&#8217;s case against dust <em>(e.g. by arguing that BICEP2, by overestimating the intensity of dust emission as measured by Planck, was led to strongly underestimate the average amount of dust polarization; that BICEP2 disregarded lensing effects in one of its arguments against dust; that BICEP2&#8217;s evidence that their data was uncorrelated with dust measurements carries no weight).</em>  But when the papers try to make more quantitative statements about just how big the dust effect could be&#8230; well.  As far as I can tell, the methods used involve arbitrary judgment calls, and in the second paper these aren&#8217;t even clearly explained, and lead to key claims that can&#8217;t be verified by the reader.  That said, I&#8217;m not suggesting that anyone could do any better right now, given how little information we have about polarization in the BICEP2 region.  But I would suggest that experts read the words in these papers <em>very</em> carefully before attempting to evaluate the plausibility and reliability of the most important plots shown.</p>
<p>Since the whole discussion is currently so vague, I probably won&#8217;t say more about this until someone says something more convincing, or until BICEP2 publicly responds, if they choose to do so. The bottom line, for now, is clear enough: BICEP2 hasn&#8217;t made a case that overwhelmingly convinces the world&#8217;s experts.  The community will therefore remain collectively undecided until a precise determination is made of the amount of polarized dust in BICEP2&#8217;s region of the sky.  That lies six months to a year in the future. Until then, our knowledge will remain hazy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the concepts that&#8217;s playing a big role in contemporary discussions of the laws of nature is the notion of &#8220;vacua&#8221;, the plural of the word &#8220;vacuum&#8221;. I&#8217;ve just completed <a title="Theories and Vacua" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/theories-and-vacua/" target="_blank">an article about what vacua are, and what it means for a universe to have multiple vacua, or for a theory that purports to describe a universe to predict that it has multiple vacua</a>. In case you don&#8217;t want to plunge right in to that article, here&#8217;s a brief summary of why this is interesting and important.</p>
<p>Outside of physics, most people think of a vacuum as being the absence of air. For physicists thinking about the laws of nature, &#8220;vacuum&#8221; means space that has been emptied of <em>everything</em> &#8212; at least, emptied of <strong><em>everything that can actually be removed</em></strong>. That certainly means removing all particles from it. But even though vacuum implies emptiness, it turns out that empty space isn&#8217;t really that empty. There are always fields in that space, fields like the electric and magnetic fields, the electron field, the quark field, the Higgs field. And those fields are always up to something.</p>
<p>First, all of the fields are subject to &#8220;<a title="Quantum Fluctuations and Their Energy" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/quantum-fluctuations-and-their-energy/" target="_blank">quantum fluctuations</a>&#8221; &#8212; a sort of unstoppable jitter that nothing in our quantum world can avoid.  <em>[Sometimes these fluctuations are referred to as <a title="Virtual Particles: What are they?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/virtual-particles-what-are-they/" target="_blank">&#8220;virtual particles&#8221;; but despite the name, those aren&#8217;t particles</a>.  Real particles are well-behaved, long-lived ripples in those fields; fluctuations are much more random.]</em> These fluctuations are always present, in any form of empty space.</p>
<p>Second, and more important for our current discussion, some of the fields <strong>may have average values that aren&#8217;t zero</strong>. [In our own familiar form of empty space, the <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">Higgs field has a non-zero average value</a>, one that causes many of <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the known elementary particles</a> to acquire a mass (i.e. a <a title="The Two Definitions of “Mass”, And Why I Use Only One" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/more-on-mass/the-two-definitions-of-mass-and-why-i-use-only-one/" target="_blank">rest mass</a>).] And it&#8217;s because of this that the notion of vacuum can have a plural: forms of empty space can differ, even for a single universe, if the fields of that universe can take different possible average values in empty space. If a given universe can have more than one form of empty space, we say that &#8220;it has more than one vacuum&#8221;.</p>
<p>There are reasons to think our own universe might have more than one form of vacuum &#8212; more than just the one we&#8217;re familiar with. It is possible that the Standard Model (the equations used to describe all of <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the known elementary particles, and all the known forces except gravity</a>) is a good description of our world, even up to much higher energies than our current particle physics experiments can probe. Physicists can predict, using those equations, how many forms of empty space our world would have. And their calculations show that our world would have (at least) two vacua: the one we know, along with a second, exotic one, with a much larger average value for the Higgs field. (Remember, this prediction is based on the assumption that the Standard Model&#8217;s equations apply in the first place.)  An electron in empty space would have a much larger mass than the electrons we know and love (and need!)</p>
<p>The future of the universe, and our understanding of how the universe came to be, might crucially depend on this second, exotic vacuum. <a title="Theories and Vacua" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/theories-and-vacua/" target="_blank">Today&#8217;s article</a> sets the stage for future articles, which will provide an explanation of why the vacua of the universe play such a central role in our understanding of nature at its most elemental.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been a quiet couple of weeks on the blog, something which often indicates that it&#8217;s been anything but quiet <em>off</em> the blog. Such was indeed the case recently.</p>
<p>For one thing, I was in Canada last week. I had been kindly invited to give two talks at the University of Western Ontario, one of Canada&#8217;s leading universities for science. One of the talks, the annual <a href="http://www.apmaths.uwo.ca/upcomingevents/nerenberg_series.shtml" target="_blank">Nerenberg lecture</a> (in memory of Professor Morton Nerenberg) is intended for the general public, so I presented a lecture on The 2013 Nobel Prize: The 50-Year Quest for the Higgs Boson. While I have given a talk on this subject before (<a title="Movie Clips" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/videoclips/" target="_blank">an older version is on-line</a>) I felt some revisions would be useful. The other talk was for members of the applied mathematics department, which hosts a diverse group of academics. Unlike <a title="The Challenges of Writing a “Colloquium”" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/09/14/the-challenges-of-writing-a-colloquium/" target="_blank">a typical colloquium for a physics department</a>, where I can assume that the vast majority of the audience has had university-level quantum mechanics, this talk required me to adjust my presentation for a much broader scientific audience than usual.  I followed, to an extent, my website&#8217;s series on <a title="Fields and Their Particles: With Math" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/fields-and-their-particles-with-math/" target="_blank">Fields and Particles</a> and on <a title="How the Higgs Field Works (with math)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/how-the-higgs-field-works-with-math/" target="_blank">How the Higgs Field Works</a>, both of which require first-year university math and physics, but nothing more. Preparation of the two talks, along with travel, occupied most of my free time over recent days, so I haven&#8217;t been able to write, or even respond to readers&#8217; questions, unfortunately.</p>
<p>I also dropped in at Canada&#8217;s <a href="https://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/" target="_blank">Perimeter Institute</a> on Friday, when it was hosting <a href="http://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/conferences/implications-bicep-2" target="_blank">a small but intense one-day workshop</a> on the recent <a title="BICEP2: New Evidence Of Cosmic Inflation!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/bicep2-new-evidence-of-cosmic-inflation/" target="_blank">potentially huge discovery by the BICEP2 experiment</a> of what appears to be <a title="A Primer On Today’s Events" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/a-primer-on-todays-events/" target="_blank">a signature of gravitational waves from the early universe</a>. This offered me an opportunity to hear some of the world&#8217;s leading experts talking about the recent measurement and its potential implications (<strong>if</strong> it is correct, and <strong>if</strong> the simplest interpretation of it is correct). Alternative explanations of the experiment&#8217;s results were also mentioned. Also, there was a lot of discussion about the future, both the short-term and the long-term. Quite a few measurements will be made in the next six to twelve months that will shed further light on the BICEP2 measurement, and on its moderate conflict with the simplest interpretation of certain data from <a title="The Universe According to Planck (The Satellite)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/03/21/the-universe-according-to-planck-the-satellite/" target="_blank">the Planck satellite</a>.  Further down the line, a very important step will be to reduce the amount of B-mode polarization that arises from the gravitational lensing of E-mode polarization, a method called &#8220;delensing&#8221;; this will make it easier to observe the B-mode polarization <em>from gravitational waves (</em>which is what we&#8217;re interested in) even at rather small angular scales (high &#8220;multipoles&#8221;).   Looking much further ahead, we will be hearing a lot of discussion about huge new space-based gravitational wave detectors such as BBO [Big Bang Observatory].  (Actually the individual detectors are quite small, but they are spaced at great distances.) These can potentially measure gravitational waves whose wavelength is comparable to the size of the Earth&#8217;s orbit or even larger, which is still much smaller than those apparently detected by BICEP2 in the polarization of the cosmic microwave background. Anyway, assuming what BICEP2 has really done is discover gravitational waves from the very early universe, this subject now a very exciting future and there is lots to do, to discuss and to plan.</p>
<p>I wish I could promise to provide a blog post summarizing carefully what I learned at the conference. But unfortunately, that brings me to the other reason blogging has been slow. While I was away, I learned that <a title="More Scientist-Hostages Uncovered" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/11/more-scientist-hostages-uncovered/" target="_blank">the funding situation for science in the United States</a> is even worse than I expected. Suffice it to say that this presents a crisis that will interfere with blogging work, at least for a while.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Familiar throughout our international culture, the &#8220;Big Bang&#8221; is well-known as the theory that scientists use to describe and explain the history of the universe. But the theory is not a single conceptual unit, and there are parts that are more reliable than others.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to understand that the theory &#8212; a set of equations describing how the universe <em>(more precisely, the <strong><em>observable patch</em></strong> of our universe, which may be a tiny fraction of the universe)</em> changes over time, and leading to sometimes precise predictions for what should, if the theory is right, be observed by humans in the sky &#8212; actually consists of different periods, some of which are far more speculative than others.  In the more speculative early periods, we must use equations in which we have limited confidence at best; moreover, data relevant to these periods, from observations of the cosmos and from particle physics experiments, is slim to none. In more recent periods, our confidence is very, very strong.</p>
<p>In my <a title="History of the Universe" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/" target="_blank">&#8220;History of the Universe&#8221; article</a> <em>[see also my related articles on <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">cosmic inflation</a>, on the <a title="Hot Big Bang" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/hot-big-bang/" target="_blank">Hot Big Bang</a>, and on the <a title="Before Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/before-inflation/" target="_blank">pre-inflation period</a>; also a comment that <a title="Big Bang: Expansion, NOT Explosion" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/big-bang-expansion-not-explosion/" target="_blank">the Big Bang is an expansion, <strong>not</strong> an explosion!</a>]</em>, the following figure appears, though without the colored zones, which I&#8217;ve added for this post. The colored zones emphasize what we know, what we suspect, and what we don&#8217;t know at all.</p>

In each colored zone, the degree of confidence and the observational/experimental source of that confidence is indicated. Three different possible starting points for the &#8220;Big Bang&#8221; are noted at the bottom; note that individual scientists may mean different things by the term.  <em>(Caution: there is a subtlety in the use of the words &#8220;Extremely Cold&#8221;; there are subtle quantum effects that I haven&#8217;t yet written about that complicate this notion.)</em></p></div>
<p>Notice that in the figure, I don&#8217;t measure time from the start of the universe.  That&#8217;s because I don&#8217;t <em>know</em> how or when the universe started (and in particular, the notion that <a title="Did The Universe Really Begin With a Singularity?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/21/did-the-universe-begin-with-a-singularity/" target="_blank">it started from a singularity</a>, or worse, <a title="Big Bang: Expansion, NOT Explosion" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/big-bang-expansion-not-explosion/" target="_blank">an exploding &#8220;cosmic egg&#8221;</a>, is simply an over-extrapolation to the past and a misunderstanding of what the theory actually says.) Instead I measure time from the start of the <strong>Hot</strong> Big Bang in the observable patch of the universe.  <em>I also don&#8217;t even know precisely when the Hot Big Bang started, but the uncertainty on that initial time (relative to other events) is less than one second &#8212; so all the times I&#8217;ll mention, which are much longer than that, aren&#8217;t affected by this uncertainty.</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll now take you through the different confidence zones of the Big Bang, from the latest to the earliest, as indicated in the figure above.</p>
<p><span id="more-7537"></span></p>
<p><strong>The Green Zone: Confidence</strong></p>
<p>A key clue that the observable patch of the universe was once hot and dense, and cooling as it expanded &#8212; i.e. that there <em>was</em> a Hot Big Bang period (preceded perhaps by cosmic inflation, but we don&#8217;t need to focus on that yet) &#8212; is the presence in the universe of the cosmic microwave background [CMB]. From all parts of the sky, an easily detectable sea of electromagnetic radiation in the form of microwaves (photons with energy about 1000 times less than photons of visible light) is streaming across the universe, and onto the Earth. Not only is the CMB a broad clue as to the universe&#8217;s past, it is also a key tool for scientists to use in finding even more precise and focused clues. Much of the history of the observable patch is imprinted in the details of the CMB.</p>
<p>A prediction of the Hot Big Bang is that the microwaves are just a sign of past heat, and of nothing else. Specifically, if you measure the microwave photons&#8217; energy, and plot <em>the amount of energy</em> coming from a patch of sky due to photons <em>of a particular frequency</em>, you should see the same plot (a &#8220;black-body spectrum&#8221;, as it is called) as you would see for photons emitted by a cold piece of ice or rock or metal.  [Yes, ice at 2.7 degrees C above <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/01/07/happy-chilly-new-year/" target="_blank">absolute zero</a> does glow in microwaves.]  The fact that the COBE satellite&#8217;s data agrees closely with the prediction of a black-body spectrum (shown in the figure) is overwhelming evidence that there was a Hot Big Bang going on at the time that atoms first formed, when the observable patch of the universe became transparent to light &#8212; a time now believed to be about 380,000 years after the Hot Big Bang began.</p>

Data from the COBE satellite is the red crosses; the green curve is the prediction of a black-body spectrum.</p></div>
<p>The most powerful evidence that a simple view of the Hot Big Bang is correct even earlier is the success of the theory (i.e. equations) for nucleosynthesis: the formation of <a title="The Nuclei of Atoms: At the Heart of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-nuclei-of-atoms-at-the-heart-of-matter/" target="_blank">atomic nuclei</a> for the lightest atoms during the Hot Big Bang.  <em>(Note the atoms themselves formed hundreds of thousands of years later, when the temperature was cool enough for <a title="Electrons: On the Outskirts of Atoms" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/electrons-on-the-outskirts-of-atoms/" target="_blank">the nuclei to capture electrons</a>.)</em>  The equations of the Hot Big Bang include</p>
<ul>
<li>Einstein&#8217;s version of gravity and</li>
<li>the &#8220;quantum field theory&#8221; used to describe <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the known particles and non-gravitational forces.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These equations can be used to calculate how abundant certain light atoms should be, if there was a Hot Big Bang.  Specifically, one can compute the ratios of how much hydrogen <em>(normal <strong>and</strong> heavy [&#8220;deuterium&#8221;])</em>, helium <em>(normal [&#8220;helium-4&#8221;] <strong>and</strong> light [&#8220;helium-3&#8221;])</em>, and lithium should be present in pristine parts of the observable patch, if the atomic nuclei of those elements were mainly forged during the cooling stages of the Hot Big Bang. If the elements other than hydrogen were only formed in stars, then there should be very little helium and virtually no deuterium in the observable patch of the universe. (Deuterium is actually destroyed in stars.) But in a cooling Hot Big Bang, a lot of helium &#8212; about 1/4 of the amount of hydrogen &#8212; and a small but measurable amount of deuterium should be produced.</p>
<p>These predictions of the Hot Big Bang depend in great detail on our understanding of particle physics and gravity &#8212; <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">of the weak nuclear force, the strong nuclear force, the electromagnetic force, the gravitational force (in Einstein&#8217;s version of it) and on the properties of neutrinos, electrons, photons, protons and neutrons.</a> And the numbers work! The amount of helium, relative to ordinary hydrogen, is predicted to be in the 20 &#8211; 25% range; deuterium is predicted to be in the range of one part in 10,000 to 100,000, helium-3 a factor of 10 smaller than that, and lithium in the part per 10 billion range. The data agree!</p>

<p>That these predictions agree with observations of the distant cosmos (see the figure below) provides a strong argument that the Hot Big Bang really occurred, and was originally hot enough to break apart nuclei.  That means that temperatures were initially at least hot enough that the typical particle had an energy of about 0.001 <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/" target="_blank">GeV</a>, which would have happened a few minutes after the Hot Big Bang began.  More precise measurements even help us understand how much ordinary matter there is in the observable patch of the universe, with results that agree with other measurements of the same quantity.</p>
<p>For this reason, I&#8217;ve marked the nucleosynthesis period and what follows it in <span style="color:#008000;">green</span>, to emphasize that we have strong observational evidence that the Hot Big Bang did occur, and was so hot &#8212; hot enough to destroy atomic nuclei &#8212; that the atomic nuclei around us today had to form from scratch as the temperature cooled.</p>
<p><strong>The Yellow Zone: Extrapolating a Bit Using Particle Physics</strong></p>
<p>However, for times before nucleosynthesis, the arguments are weaker. We don&#8217;t have much direct evidence for what was taking place. But we have a lot of knowledge about particle physics, up to energies of a few hundred GeV, thanks to the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC] and its predecessors over the last few decades.  So if we assume that the Hot Big Bang started at temperatures so high that a typical particle would have had an energy of a few hundred <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/" target="_blank">GeV</a>, we can calculate the observable patch&#8217;s properties from that temperature downward. At such a high temperature,</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">Higgs field would have been &#8220;off&#8221;</a>, so <a title="The Known Particles — If The Higgs Field Were Zero" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/the-known-particles-if-the-higgs-field-were-zero/" target="_blank">many particles would not have had their usual masses</a>; and</li>
<li>also, separately, quarks and gluons would have been free to roam.</li>
</ul>
<p>As the temperature cooled, we can calculate <em>(now that <a title="Discovery of the Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-discovery-of-the-higgs/" target="_blank">we know the Higgs particle&#8217;s mass</a>, and if we assume there aren&#8217;t any lightweight particles that we don&#8217;t know about)</em> that first the Higgs field would have turned &#8220;on&#8221;, making the weak nuclear force henceforth weak; and then, a bit later, the strong nuclear force would have become very strong, so that quarks and gluons and anti-quarks would have been trapped henceforth and forever into <a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/" target="_blank">protons</a>, <a title="The Nuclei of Atoms: At the Heart of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-nuclei-of-atoms-at-the-heart-of-matter/" target="_blank">neutrons</a>, anti-protons and anti-neutrons, as well as other very short-lived <a title="What’s a Hadron?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-hadron-as-in-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">hadrons</a>.</p>
<p>However, we can&#8217;t yet directly confirm <em>by cosmological observation</em> that this is true.  It&#8217;s not entirely impossible that there was something odd and unknown about the universe that makes some of these conclusions premature. Someday we may be able to be more certain, but not yet. So in this time period, starting just before the Higgs field turns on and going until nucleosynthesis, we have a highly educated guess as to what was happening, though no direct experimental checks.  That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve marked this time period in <span style="color:#333333;">yellow</span>.</p>
<p><strong>The Orange Zone: What Started the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Hot</span> Big Bang?</strong></p>
<p>Even earlier? Well, at even higher temperatures we don&#8217;t know the particle physics with confidence; we&#8217;d need particle accelerators more powerful than the LHC.  To figure out what happened in the Big Bang in detail, we have to make assumptions about the particles available, without any way to check them. But still, we are not without information, because we do have an experimental probe: the CMB itself.</p>
<p>It is a remarkable fact that the CMB is incredibly uniform, to one part in 100,000. That&#8217;s already information, and explaining why it&#8217;s true is one of the arguments in favor of <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">cosmic inflation</a>.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s much, much more information in the <em>imperfections</em> in that uniformity. The non-uniformities, which were discovered by the COBE satellite, have been studied in detail by the WMAP and Planck satellites, along with many other experiments from the ground. And it was in studying the non-uniformities in the CMB and their tiny bit of polarization that BICEP2 made <a title="BICEP2: New Evidence Of Cosmic Inflation!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/bicep2-new-evidence-of-cosmic-inflation/" target="_blank">the big (but <del>unconfirmed</del> now discredited) discovery that was announced last week</a> (here&#8217;s some <a title="A Primer On Today’s Events" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/a-primer-on-todays-events/" target="_blank">background information on that discovery, in the form of FAQs, that you may find useful</a>).</p>
<p>The photons in the CMB are astonishingly sensitive. There are very few things that affect them, and fortunately, most of the things that do are relics from the extremely early periods of the observable patch of the universe. It&#8217;s an unexpected gift for scientists that this is true! The CMB photons were created about 380,000 years after the Hot Big Bang, and yet they give us insight into the entire period before that, all the way back to a period <em>just before</em> the Hot Big Bang!!!  (They also can give us important insights into what happened <em>after</em> 380,000 years, too.)  To me, this incredibly sensitivity of the CMB is one of the most amazing natural phenomena in all of science&#8230; and it has been the key to progress in cosmology in recent years.</p>
<p>Detailed measurements of the CMB have increasingly given us insight into the zone marked in orange, where we don&#8217;t have any particle physics data &#8212; just guesses, and calculations based on those guesses.  The reason insights have been possible is that our calculations rely on very general properties of the Hot Big Bang and the pre-Hot Big Bang period to make predictions.  What I mean by this is that these calculations begin with very simple assumptions about the patterns of non-uniformities that were present at the start of the Hot Big Bang, and then we check if these assumptions give predictions for non-uniformities in the CMB that agree with data.  They do!  This is shown in the figure below, where predictions of the Hot Big Bang theory, <em>with these simple assumptions about the starting point</em>, are compared with data from the Planck satellite. (Similar but less precise measurements were made before Planck, by WMAP and a number of ground-based experiments.)</p>

<p>Thus, simple assumptions about the non-uniformities at the start of the Hot Big Bang seem to be right, more or less.  This lends support to the hypothesis of cosmic inflation, which can produce simple non-uniformities. But it&#8217;s not convincing, because one can imagine simple non-uniformities arising in some other way.  There is at least one alternative &#8212; the ekpyrotic universe &#8212; that is also largely consistent with this data, and there might have been others that no one has thought of.  Meanwhile, there were many qualitatively different forms that cosmic inflation might take, some of which could have been consistent with universes quite different from those with a simple Big Bang.  For example, the data has been consistent with universes that, at temperatures a bit higher than reached in the yellow zone in the figure, have more spatial dimensions than the three we&#8217;re used to. So the number of possible options in the orange zone has been very large, and the degree of speculation involved has been very high.</p>

<p>This <del>may have changed</del> with <a title="BICEP2: New Evidence Of Cosmic Inflation!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/bicep2-new-evidence-of-cosmic-inflation/">BICEP2s new measurement,</a> which <del>gives</del> unfortunately did not give powerful new evidence for cosmic inflation through inflation&#8217;s generation of gravitational waves&#8230; assuming the measurement itself, and the interpretation of the measurement, both hold up over time.  <em>[The interpretation did not.]</em> Since a measurable amount of gravitational waves can only be produced, as far as we know, if a period of inflation occurred and was <a title="If It Holds Up, What Might BICEP2′s Discovery Mean?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/18/if-its-holds-up-what-might-bicep2s-discovery-mean/" target="_blank">driven by a <strong>very</strong> large amount of &#8220;dark `energy&#8217; &#8220;</a>, BICEP2&#8217;s result may rule out all known alternatives to inflation, and significantly narrow down the options for how inflation may have occurred, excluding many of the more radical options as well as many simple ones. As such, it may increase confidence in the inflation hypothesis to change the color of the orange zone to yellow, or even, as more measurements come in and become more precise, to green.  <em>[But it did not.]</em></p>
<p>However, let&#8217;s not jump to conclusions until the measurement is confirmed with more data and by other observing teams.  <em>[You see how important it is that I write these cautionary caveats in my articles.  I have seen many measurements come and go; the fraction that stick is much less than half.]</em></p>
<p><strong>The Red Zone: Scientific Guesswork</strong></p>
<p>But BICEP2 can really only tell us about <strong><em>the late stage and exit from inflation</em></strong>. If we go deep into the inflationary period and try to go earlier, into the red zone in the figure, we face two problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>we don&#8217;t have any experimental probes of this early time, and</li>
<li>we don&#8217;t know which particle physics and/or gravity equations we should be using.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not yet have any cosmological observations that access this time period; the CMB photons bring us back to the late stage of inflation, but not further. We cannot infer much yet from CMB measurements about the &#8220;inflaton&#8221; field (and its particle) that is supposed to play the dominant particle-physics role during inflation, and we have no idea what other types of fields it may interact with, so it is hard to be sure what type of process got inflation started. Meanwhile, theoretical physics doesn&#8217;t help much either. We can try assuming that string theory is the true theory of quantum gravity in our world, but if we do that, we still find the equations are hard to solve and give, at best, a variety of possibilities. And trying to work in greater generality, without assuming string theory, doesn&#8217;t help; the calculations are still ambiguous and difficult. This doesn&#8217;t stop theoretical physicists from making educated, scientific guesses &#8212; i.e., speculations backed with concrete equations and calculations. But until we get some data that allows us to distinguish the many possibilities, we can&#8217;t say for sure what was actually happening back then.</p>
<p>So if people tells you that the universe <em>started</em> in such and such a way, perhaps &#8220;<a title="Did The Universe Really Begin With a Singularity?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/21/did-the-universe-begin-with-a-singularity/" target="_blank">with a singularity</a>&#8221; or &#8220;with a quantum fluctuation out of nothing&#8221; or &#8220;in the Big Crunch (i.e. the collapse) of a previous phase of the universe&#8221;, remember that they&#8217;re telling you about the <span style="color:#ff0000;">red zone</span>. They&#8217;re neglecting to tell you that what they&#8217;re saying is pure theory, with neither an experiment to back it up nor a clear theoretical reason to believe their suggestion is unique and preferable over someone else&#8217;s alternative. Only a bit later in cosmic history, once we focus on the late stages of inflation, and forward in time from there to nucleosynthesis, do we have both data (cosmological observation and particle physics collisions) and reasonably reliable theory (Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity plus the Standard Model of particle physics). Our confidence grows as time moves forward, the observable patch of the universe cools, and physics becomes of a sort that we&#8217;ve tested in numerous experiments already.</p>
<p>From this, I hope that you can see that the Big Bang Theory really isn&#8217;t a single, undifferentiated structure.  The most reliable part of the theory is that there was, at one point, a <a title="Hot Big Bang" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/hot-big-bang/" target="_blank">Hot stage of the Big Bang</a>. (Some people call that the Big Bang, in fact.) If BICEP2&#8217;s measurement is accurate, and correctly interpreted, then the reliable portion of the theory may then include a period of <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">inflation that preceded</a> the Hot Big Bang. (Some people would call &#8220;inflation plus the Hot Big Bang&#8221; the &#8220;Big Bang&#8221;.) But anything before inflation is not in the least reliable&#8230; in particular, the notion that the universe&#8217;s heat and density increased <a title="Did The Universe Really Begin With a Singularity?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/21/did-the-universe-begin-with-a-singularity/" target="_blank">to the extent that Einstein&#8217;s equations have a singularity, presumably indicating that they&#8217;re not sufficient to describe what was going on, is an <em>assumption</em></a>. So that part of the Big Bang Theory may not survive the test of time. You should be prepared, as scientists are, to let it go.  After all, from 1960-1980 people had a vision of the early Big Bang that didn&#8217;t include something like inflation; their version was significantly adjusted as knowledge was gained, so why shouldn&#8217;t ours be?</p>
<p>Moreover, it is quite possible that the start of the universe, which people often refer to as the ultimate Big Bang, may not have had anything &#8220;Bang-ish&#8221; or even Big about it.  Yes, we might even need to let go someday of the idea that the universe truly <em>began</em> with a Big Bang. The scientific community won&#8217;t have any problem with this, because many of us have never taken that idea very seriously in the first place.  But what about the rest of our society, which seems to hold to this name and notion far harder than do scientists themselves, to the point of <em>(egad!)</em> naming a television show after it?!  The loss may be more shocking than necessary&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did the universe begin with a singularity?  A point in space and/or a moment in time where everything in the universe was crushed together, infinitely hot and infinitely densely packed?</p>
<p><strong><em>Doesn&#8217;t the Big Bang Theory say so?</em></strong></p>
<p>Well, let me ask you a question. Did <strong>you</strong> begin with a singularity?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see. Some decades ago, you were smaller. And then before that, you were even smaller. At some point you could fit inside your mother&#8217;s body, and if we follow time backwards, you were even much smaller than that.</p>
<p>If we follow your growth curve back, it would be very natural &#8212; if we didn&#8217;t know anything about biology, cells, and human reproduction &#8212; to assume that initially you were infinitesimally small&#8230; that you were created from a single point!</p>
<p>But that would be wrong. The mistake is obvious &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t make sense to assume that the period of rapid growth that you went through as a tiny embryo was the simple continuation of a process that extends on and on into the past, back until you were infinitely small.  Instead, there was a point where something changed&#8230; the growth began not from a point but from a single object of definite size: a fertilized egg.</p>
<p>The notion that the Universe <em>started</em> with a Big Bang, and that this Big Bang <em>started</em> from a singularity &#8212; a point in space and/or a moment in time where the universe was infinitely hot and dense &#8212; is not that different, really, from assuming humans begin their lives as infinitely small eggs. It&#8217;s about over-extrapolating into the past.<span id="more-7526"></span></p>
<p>The connection with some kind of singularity dates back to the original Big Bang idea, the one which precedes the notion of <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">cosmic inflation</a> that&#8217;s been in the news over the past few days.  <em>[Here&#8217;s <a title="A Primer On Today’s Events" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/a-primer-on-todays-events/" target="_blank">an FAQ</a> for non-experts about the news; <a title="BICEP2: New Evidence Of Cosmic Inflation!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/bicep2-new-evidence-of-cosmic-inflation/" target="_blank">the news</a> itself; and <a title="If It Holds Up, What Might BICEP2′s Discovery Mean?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/18/if-its-holds-up-what-might-bicep2s-discovery-mean/" target="_blank">what the news might mean if it holds up</a>.]</em>  The part of the universe that we can see with our eyes and telescopes is the &#8220;observable patch&#8221; of the universe; it is probably far smaller than the whole universe <em>(or, if it&#8217;s sufficiently complicated, &#8220;the multiverse&#8221;).</em>  What we know from interpreting various observations of the cosmos is that</p>
<ul>
<li>today the observable patch is cold and diffuse and expanding</li>
<li>once upon a time, billions of years ago, the observable patch was hot and dense</li>
</ul>
<p>To the extent that we trust Einstein&#8217;s equations for gravity, we can use those equations to understand how the Universe might have had this present and that past.  People studying those equations (Friedmann, LeMaître, Robertson and Walker) learned that a universe can go through a process of expanding, cooling and diffusing &#8212; and thus could proceed from <span style="color:#ff9900;"><strong>a hot, dense, rapidly expanding past</strong></span> to <span style="color:#000080;">a <strong><span style="color:#00ccff;"><em>cool, diffuse and slowly expanding present</em></span></strong></span>. This process is what we think our observable patch (and probably a larger region in which it is contained) has been doing for almost all of its 13.7 billion year history.</p>
<p>But suppose, seeing this behavior, we use these equations try to follow time <em>backwards</em> &#8212; just as we tried to infer the past of an embryo. We find our equations suggest a universe in which the further you go back, the hotter it was, the more dense, and the more rapidly it was expanding. If you keep going back and back, then <em>(in the Old Big Bang model, before we knew about inflation)</em> you find that at a sufficiently early time, 13.7 billion years ago, the density, temperature and expansion rate start off as <strong>infinite</strong>. That&#8217;s a <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>singularity!</em></span></p>
<p>But would you have a reason to believe in that singularity?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve talked over the years with many experts in &#8220;quantum gravity&#8221; <em>[the poorly understood but required blend of Einstein&#8217;s gravity and quantum physics, a blend that will be needed to explain extreme gravitational phenomena]</em> and I&#8217;ve never spoken to one who  believed that the universe began with a real singularity. Why? Because</p>
<ul>
<li>the singularity arises from using Einstein&#8217;s equations for gravity</li>
<li>but we know Einstein&#8217;s equations aren&#8217;t <em>sufficient</em> &#8212; they aren&#8217;t able to describe certain extreme gravitational phenomena.</li>
</ul>
<p>Specifically, when the density and heat become extremely large, quantum physics of gravity becomes important. <em>But Einstein&#8217;s equations ignore all these quantum effects.</em> So we already know that <strong><em>in certain extreme conditions, Einstein&#8217;s equations simply don&#8217;t apply</em></strong>. How could we then use those very same equations to conclude there&#8217;s a singularity at the beginning of the universe?</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t.</p>
<p>And if we don&#8217;t know how to alter Einstein&#8217;s gravity equations to make them into quantum gravity equations, then &#8212; well, we don&#8217;t know what happens <em>instead</em> of a singularity.</p>
<p>Now that was where things stood before inflation was known. Inflation changes the details of the <a title="History of the Universe" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/" target="_blank">history of the universe</a> quite a lot. But it doesn&#8217;t change the basic conclusion about singularities: we don&#8217;t and can&#8217;t yet know what happened at the earliest moments of the universe, because we have neither data nor sufficiently clear equations to help us answer basic questions about it.  Related to this, we don&#8217;t know precisely how inflation started (or even <em>could</em> have started) in the first place.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not making this up out of my head.  Just yesterday I was involved in a long conversation with professors and post-doctoral researchers at Harvard, in which we discussed various exotic mathematical methods for exploring the inflationary epoch and the era before it. The possibility that there really is a singularity at the beginning of the universe never came up once.</p>
<p>Or you can look at papers by the world&#8217;s experts &#8212; say, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0702178" target="_blank">one by Alan Guth, a 17-page review</a> of &#8220;eternal&#8221; inflation (i.e. inflation that continues, at least somewhere in our very large universe, into the infinite future) &#8212; and although he devotes some pages to the issue of what might have preceded inflation, the word &#8220;singularity&#8221; does not appear anywhere in his text.</p>
<p>Or look at the figure below, taken from page 6 of <a href="http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/lectures/Biermann_07/LindeLecturesMunich1.pdf" target="_blank">a lecture by Andrei Linde in 2007</a>, giving a schematic depiction of the history of the part of the universe that contains our observable patch.   You see that he shows it as beginning not in a singularity but in &#8220;space-time foam&#8221;. <em>[Compare his picture with the one in my <a title="History of the Universe" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/" target="_blank">History of the Universe</a> article.]</em> What&#8217;s space-time foam? It&#8217;s space-time that is undergoing <a title="Quantum Fluctuations and Their Energy" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/quantum-fluctuations-and-their-energy/" target="_blank">quantum fluctuations</a> &#8212; quantum jitter &#8212; in which space itself is changing its shape from moment to moment!  Well, when someone writes &#8220;space-time foam&#8221; on a graph, to physicists it means almost the same as writing &#8220;somehow quantum gravity takes care of everything&#8221;, without specifics.  (I am confident that Linde will agree that the extreme left of his figure is quite speculative.)</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">Yet all over the media and all over the web, we can find articles, including ones published just after <a title="BICEP2: New Evidence Of Cosmic Inflation!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/bicep2-new-evidence-of-cosmic-inflation/" target="_blank">this week&#8217;s cosmic announcement of new evidence in favor of inflation</a>, that state with great confidence that in the Big Bang Theory the universe started from a singularity. So I&#8217;m honestly very confused. <strong>Who</strong> is still telling the media and the public that the universe really started with a singularity, or that the modern Big Bang Theory says that it does? I&#8217;ve never heard an expert physicist say that. And with good reason: when singularities and other infinities have turned up in our equations in the past, those singularities disappeared when our equations, or our understanding of how to use our equations, improved. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">Moreover, there&#8217;s a point of logic here.  How <em>could</em> we possibly know what happened at the very beginning of the universe? No experiment can yet probe such an early time, and none of the available equations are powerful enough or usable enough to allow us to come to clear and unique conclusions.</span></p>
<p>The modern Big Bang Theory really starts <em>after</em> this period of ignorance, <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">with a burst of inflation that creates a large expanding universe, and the end of inflation which allows for the creation of the heat of the Hot Big Bang</a>.  The equations for the theory, as it currently stands, can be used to make predictions <em>even though</em> we don&#8217;t know the precise nature of our universe&#8217;s birth. Yes, a singularity often turns up in our equations when we extend them as far as they can go in the past; but a singularity of this sort is far from likely to be an aspect of nature, and instead should be interpreted as a sign of what we don&#8217;t yet understand.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, <a title="BICEP2: New Evidence Of Cosmic Inflation!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/bicep2-new-evidence-of-cosmic-inflation/" target="_blank">yesterday was quite a day</a>, and I&#8217;m still sifting through the consequences.</p>
<p>First things first.  As with all major claims of discovery, <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">considerable caution is advised until the BICEP2 measurement has been verified by some other experiment</span></strong>.   Moreover, even if the measurement is correct, <span style="color:#800080;"><strong>one should not assume that the interpretation in terms of gravitational waves and inflation is correct; this requires more study and further confirmation.</strong></span></p>
<p>The media <strong>is</strong> assuming BICEP2&#8217;s measurement is correct, and that the interpretation in terms of inflation is correct, but leading scientists are not so quick to rush to judgment, and are thinking things through carefully.  Scientists are cautious not just because they&#8217;re trained to be thoughtful and careful but also because <em><strong>they&#8217;ve seen many claims of discovery withdrawn or discredited</strong></em>; discoveries are made when humans go where no one has previously gone, with technology that no one has previously used &#8212; and surprises, mistakes, and misinterpretations happen often.</p>
<p>But in this post, I&#8217;m going to <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">assume</span> <span style="color:#ff9900;">assume</span> <span style="color:#0000ff;">assume</span></strong> that BICEP2&#8217;s results are correct, or essentially correct, and are being correctly interpreted.  Let&#8217;s <strong>assume</strong> that <em>[here&#8217;s <a title="A Primer On Today’s Events" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/a-primer-on-todays-events/" target="_blank">a primer on yesterday&#8217;s result that defines these terms</a>]</em></p>
<ul>
<li>they really have detected &#8220;B-mode polarization&#8221; in the &#8220;CMB&#8221; [Cosmic Microwave Background, the photons (particles of light) that are the ancient, cool glow leftover from <a title="Hot Big Bang" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/hot-big-bang/" target="_blank">the Hot Big Bang</a>]</li>
<li>that this B-mode polarization really is a sign of gravitational waves generated during a brief but dramatic period of <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">cosmic inflation</a> that immediately preceded <a title="Hot Big Bang" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/hot-big-bang/" target="_blank">the Hot Big Bang</a>,</li>
</ul>
<p>Then &#8212; <span style="color:#ff0000;">IF</span> BICEP2&#8217;s results were basically right and were being correctly interpreted concerning inflation &#8212; what would be the implications?</p>
<p>Well&#8230;<strong> <em>Wow&#8230;  </em></strong>They&#8217;d really be quite amazing.<span id="more-7493"></span></p>
<p>Would this story be bigger than the <a title="The Day of the Higgs!!!!  DISCOVERY!!! History Made!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/07/04/the-day-of-the-higgs/" target="_blank">discovery of the Higgs particle</a>?  Certainly <em><strong>at least as</strong></em> big.  To try to compare the two gets us into silly discussions; you can&#8217;t know the long-term implications of a discovery at or near the time it is made.  But the immediate list of implications would certainly be longer.</p>
<p><strong>Some Definitions</strong></p>
<p>Before I start: we&#8217;ll need some definitions, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/some-definitions-for-cosmology/" target="_blank">given in this article</a>, of:</p>
<ul>
<li>A unit of energy called GeV (roughly the mass-energy of a hydrogen atom)</li>
<li>The Planck energy, Planck mass and Planck length (processes involving the Planck energy or mass in a region the size of the Planck length will generally involve both quantum mechanics and gravity [&#8220;quantum gravity&#8221;])</li>
<li>The energy scale associated with dark energy (which is not quite the amount of dark energy &#8212; for one thing, despite the name, dark `energy&#8217; is actually an energy per unit volume.)</li>
</ul>
<p>If any of these is unfamiliar to you, you may want to read <a title="Some Definitions for Cosmology" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/some-definitions-for-cosmology/" target="_blank">that article</a> first and to have it handy, in another tab or window, to serve as a glossary.  You may also want to have my <a title="History of the Universe" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/" target="_blank">History of the Universe</a> or my <a title="A Primer On Today’s Events" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/a-primer-on-todays-events/" target="_blank">BICEP2 Discovery Primer</a> hand.</p>
<p><strong>Implications of BICEP2&#8217;s Discovery &#8212;</strong> <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">IF &#8230; IF &#8230;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">IF IF IF</span></strong> BICEP2&#8217;s measurement is correct, at least roughly, and <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">IF IF IF </span></strong>it is being correctly interpreted, at least roughly, then there&#8217;s a long list of broad implications that I can think of, or that others of my colleagues have pointed out to me in conversations.  Some of them are vague &#8212; areas where the implications are likely to be important but are not yet very clear.  Some of these things were already somewhat implied by the previous experimental successes of the theory of inflation, while some stem directly from BICEP2.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>IF &#8230; IF &#8230;</strong></span></p>
<p>A puzzle that bothered scientists for decades, as to how the observable patch of the universe (i.e. the part that we can actually observe today; the universe may be much, much larger than this &#8212; <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">see here</a>) could be so uniform, would indeed be firmly solved, by a period of <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">cosmic inflation</a>.  The extremely flat geometry of the universe would also now be firmly explained.</p>
<p>We would also have confirmation about how the universe became hot &#8212; about how the Hot Big Bang got started.  The picture would be this: a large amount of <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">dark energy first makes the universe big, via inflation, and then the dark energy turns into energetic particles, making the universe hot (and still expanding, albeit more and more slowly</a> [until <a title="A Nobel Prize That’s No Surprise" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/10/04/a-nobel-prize-thats-no-surprise/" target="_blank">relatively recently</a>]).  Some people like to say that inflation puts the &#8220;Bang&#8221; in &#8220;Big Bang&#8221;, but remember that it also makes the universe flat and uniform and huge (typically much larger than the observable patch) before it heats it up.</p>
<p>The existence of cosmic inflation would itself be another feather in the cap of Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity &#8212; since it is Einstein&#8217;s theory that predicts that the presence of a positive cosmological &#8220;constant&#8221; [not necessarily constant], also known as &#8220;dark `energy&#8217; &#8221; [not really energy, but energy density and negative pressure in just the right combination] actually causes the universe to expand, rather than (as we&#8217;d naively expect from gravity) contract.</p>
<p>And <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">(IF&#8230; IF&#8230;)</span></strong> the confirmation of cosmic inflation would mean that those who pointed it out and its advantages, and developed the idea &#8212; people like Starobinsky, Guth, Steinhardt, Linde &#8212; ought to be able to celebrate (though not all will do so, because they abandoned the idea&#8230;)</p>
<p>Also celebrating would be those who pointed out the possibility of a detectable signal from gravitational waves in the polarization of the CMB, which is what BICEP2 has apparently observed.  I believe these would be Kamionkowsi, Kosowsky, Stebbins, Seljak and Zaldarriaga (but the cosmologists should correct me if I&#8217;m unfair here.)</p>
<p>Were there any doubt left concerning Einstein&#8217;s prediction that gravitational waves exist &#8212; perhaps some leftover worry about the 1993-Nobel-Prize-winning indirect detection of energy carried being off by these waves, via <a href="http://www.astro.cardiff.ac.uk/research/gravity/tutorial/?page=3thehulsetaylor" target="_blank">precision measurements of a pulsar, one of a pair of closely-orbiting neutron stars</a> discovered by Hulse and Taylor &#8212; it would be over.</p>
<p>And if anyone still wasn&#8217;t sure that gravity is due to a spin-two field, not  a spin-zero field, the BICEP2 result would settle the matter; you can&#8217;t get B-mode polarization of the CMB without <a title="A Primer On Today’s Events" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/a-primer-on-todays-events/" target="_blank">combining the spin-two polarization structure of the gravitational waves with Thomson scattering</a>.</p>
<p>If there were any doubt that gravity is controlled, just like everything else, by quantum physics, it would erased; BICEP2&#8217;s observation would imply that just like other fields, which are subject to quantum jitter (i.e., random &#8220;<a title="Quantum Fluctuations and Their Energy" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/quantum-fluctuations-and-their-energy/" target="_blank">fluctuations</a>&#8220;), space and time <em>(somewhat more precisely, the metric that determines distances)</em> undergoes the same type of quantum fluctuations as other fields, fluctuations that <em>any</em> quantum version of Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity would predict.  No details about quantum gravity are needed for this conclusion.</p>
<p><span style="color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">The amount of dark energy required during inflation, in order that BICEP2 could observe this gravitational wave signal, would <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>(IF&#8230; IF&#8230;)</strong></span> be enormous.  The energy scale of dark energy [<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/some-definitions-for-cosmology/" target="_blank">defined here</a>] would be about 10<sup>16</sup> GeV, just about 100 times less than the absolute maximum possible, which is the (reduced) Planck scale.  This need not have been the case!   This energy scale  could have been trillions of times smaller, and yet still given acceptable amounts of inflation of the universe and an acceptable Hot Big BAng.  </span>Amazingly, the dark energy during inflation, if BICEP2 is right, is much larger than it <em>needed</em> to be, and almost as large as it could <em>possibly</em> be!</p>
<p><span style="color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">Moreover, if the energy scale of dark energy [<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/some-definitions-for-cosmology/" target="_blank">defined here</a>] had been just a few times weaker than BICEP2 observes &#8212; 1000 times less than the absolute maximum &#8212; then the gravitational wave signal would have been so faint that it would have been completely drowned out by another process (<a title="A Primer On Today’s Events" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/a-primer-on-todays-events/" target="_blank">lensing of E-mode polarization</a>, the solid red curve on the <a title="BICEP2: New Evidence Of Cosmic Inflation!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/bicep2-new-evidence-of-cosmic-inflation/" target="_blank">first figure here</a>.)  So most of us thought, with this wide range of possibilities, that it was a real long shot that BICEP2, or any future similar experiment, would ever see any signal due to gravitational waves from inflation.  That the gravitational waves would turn out to be large and powerful enough to be observed would be an amazing piece of luck for scientists wanting to understand the universe.  (<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">IF&#8230; IF&#8230;</span></strong>)</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff6600;"><em>[The original version of this paragraph overstated what we&#8217;d know; thanks to my colleagues for pointing out a blunder concerning the heating after inflation.]</em> </span> Also, this would mean we would now have an estimate for how hot the observable patch of the universe could have become <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">after inflation ended and the region containing the observable patch became very hot</a> &#8212; the start of the Hot Big Bang.  The energy scale of the dark energy during inflation determines the maximum possible temperature at the start of the Hot Big Bang, more or less.  To say it another way: after inflation with dark energy of scale 10<sup>16</sup> GeV ended, the universe would have become hot, potentially so hot that the average particle rushing around in the hot dense soup of particles had a motion-energy of 10<sup>16</sup> GeV, though perhaps quite a bit less than this.  That&#8217;s a maximum temperature of as much as 10<sup>29</sup> degrees [yes, that&#8217;s a 1 with 29 zeroes after it!!!]</p>
<p>The Large Hadron Collider&#8217;s data provide direct insights into physics at the energy scale of around 1000 GeV or so.  [The mass-energy mc² of the Higgs particle is 125 GeV.]  The BICEP2 measurement would arguably be our first direct evidence (<span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>IF&#8230; IF&#8230;</strong></span>) concerning physics at higher energy scales than the LHC <em>(though one could argue we have a little information from the existence of neutrino masses.)</em>  And not just a little higher!  Since the scale of the dark energy at inflation is at 10<sup>16</sup> GeV, we&#8217;re talking <strong>10,000,000,000,000 times higher</strong>!!!  We&#8217;ve been trying for years, using various methods, to find evidence concerning how physics works at or near the Planck energy and Planck length.  All previous efforts have come up with nothing; proton decay might have given us insight, but it is too rare if it happens at all; neutrino oscillations haven&#8217;t given a clear pictures; cosmology might have revealed big surprises concerning the Planck energy, but none have previously shown up.  But if BICEP2 is right, then, for the first time, we are seeing phenomena which occurred near this energy scale!</p>
<p>Similarly, data from cosmology has made us very confident that we understand physics in the early universe back to the time when the first <a title="The Nuclei of Atoms: At the Heart of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-nuclei-of-atoms-at-the-heart-of-matter/" target="_blank">atomic nuclei</a> formed during the Hot Big Bang &#8212; a few minutes after the Hot Big Bang started, when the temperature was such that the typical particles had energy of about 0.001 GeV.  And we have had <em>reasonable</em> confidence that we have a decent understanding, using what we&#8217;ve learned about particle physics recently, back to times of a billionth of a second, and temperatures corresponding to an energy of a hundred GeV or so.  But now our understanding may be taking (<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">IF&#8230; IF&#8230;</span></strong>) an enormous leap, back to the very start of the Hot Big Bang, at a temperature corrresponding to an energy of as much as 10<sup>16</sup> GeV, and even earlier, into the frigid inflating universe.</p>
<p>The success of the details of the equations that form the heart of inflationary theory suggests that not only did Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity describe physics at very early times and very high energy scales, the basic principles of quantum field theory worked back then too.  It could easily have been imagined &#8212; and many have imagined, with concrete ideas backed up with equations &#8212; that there might be important principles that we are unaware of, or modifications of the ones we know, that would give very different predictions from standard inflationary theory.  So far, there&#8217;s no sign of that at all.  BICEP2&#8217;s result (<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">IF&#8230; IF&#8230;</span></strong>) would be yet another sign that despite having done all our particle physics and gravity measurements at much lower energy scales and longer distances, those accessible to the LHC and to our previous experiments, we&#8217;ve actually understood the principles that govern the behavior of phenomena at much, much higher energy scales and much shorter distances!</p>
<p>The energy scale inferred from BICEP2&#8217;s measurement, 100 times smaller than the Planck energy &#8212; 10<sup>16</sup> GeV or so &#8212; has appeared in particle physics before!  If you take the three non-gravitational forces of nature &#8212; <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force and the electromagnetic force</a> &#8212; and you first consider <a title="The Known Particles — If The Higgs Field Were Zero" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/the-known-particles-if-the-higgs-field-were-zero/" target="_blank">how they are rearranged when the Higgs field is turned off, into strong nuclear, weak isospin, and hypercharge forces</a> &#8212; and then you look at <a title="The Strengths of the Known Forces" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-forces-of-nature/the-strength-of-the-known-forces/" target="_blank">how the strengths of the forces drift</a> as you study them at shorter and shorter distances and higher and higher energies, you find the forces all become about the same strength at an energy scale of about 10<sup>16</sup> GeV or so.  This is called &#8220;unification of coupling constants&#8221; (i.e. force strengths) &#8212; or, originally and more ambitiously, &#8220;grand unification&#8221;, a grander notion that the three non-gravitational forces are actually manifestations of just one type of force.  <em>[Unification of that unified force with gravity is yet another question; that&#8217;s what string theory might do, though string theory does not require grand unification be a separate process from the unification with gravity.]</em>  Originally, back around 1980, inflation was imagined to be associated with grand unification, and if so, would have an energy scale of about &#8230; yes, 10<sup>16</sup> GeV or so.  But that idea died out long ago as people learned more about both unification and inflation.  Yet now we must wonder: could that part of the original idea, in some vague way, have actually been right?</p>
<p>Over the years, scientists have invented a plethora of variations on how inflation might have, in detail, taken place.  BICEP2&#8217;s observation of a gravitational wave signature would sweep away most of them, leaving just a few.  (More will be invented in coming months, though!)  It also would sweep away some alternatives to inflation and many speculative ideas for how the universe might behave, or might at least have behaved at earlier times.  Despite &#8220;tension&#8221; (meaning mild disagreement) between BICPS2s current data and the Planck satellite&#8217;s data, a rather simple observable patch of universe, with rather simple laws of nature and a rather simple form of inflation, are consistent with what we know.</p>
<p>One of the variants of inflation that would be excluded by BICEP2&#8217;s data is the notion (admittedly long-shot anyway) that actually the Higgs field could play the role of the inflaton after all.   It turns out that no observably large gravitational wave signal would be expected if that were true.</p>
<p>BICEP2&#8217;s result would represent the first time that, without any theoretical speculation about quantum gravity, an experiment has <strong>forced</strong> us to consider processes involving physics at the Planck scale, where quantum gravity is important.  Specifically, for a variant of inflation to give such a large gravitational wave signal <em>relative</em> to the size of the other non-uniformities in the cosmic microwave background, the Planck energy scale becomes important.  The inflaton field, which (by definition) is the field whose stored &#8220;<a title="The Energy That Holds Things Together" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/the-energy-that-holds-things-together/" target="_blank">potential energy</a>&#8221; <strong>is</strong> the dark energy, must change by an amount close to or a bit larger than the Planck energy scale. <em>[Sorry for the necessary technical-speak here. </em><em>This whole business is inherently confusing for non-experts.  The dark energy <strong>may change or may not change at all</strong> while the inflaton field is changing; that&#8217;s a separate question.  What it means for a field like an inflaton to change by the Planck energy scale is that if a particle interacted with the inflaton field as strongly as it possibly could (the way the electron interacts with the Higgs field, but stronger), then as the inflaton field changed by an amount comparable to the Planck energy scale, the particle&#8217;s mass would change by an amount comparable to the Planck mass.]</em></p>
<p>An extremely simple possibility for inflation that would still be consistent with all the data <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">(IF&#8230; IF&#8230;)</span></strong> is just to have a spin-zero field (a bit like the <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">Higgs field</a>, but with important differences &#8212; no weak nuclear force effects, for instance) which has a mass and no substantial interactions with any other fields.  This is a model introduced by Andrei Linde; it&#8217;s amazingly simple.  Could it really be correct?</p>
<p>Among the other very simple ideas that are likely to feature prominently in discussions of the near future are ones involving a &#8220;pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson&#8221;, of a type often called an &#8220;axion&#8221;.  <em>[I wrote a little about this in the paragraph just below the figure within <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/03/26/cosmic-conflation-the-higgs-the-inflaton-and-spin/" target="_blank">this post about the Planck satellite and what it means for variants of inflation.</a>]</em>  One of the variants of inflation that is most consistent with both the Planck satellite and BICEP2  <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>(IF&#8230; IF&#8230;)</strong></span> is an idea called &#8220;natural inflation&#8221;, from 1990, due to Katherine Freese, Joshua Frieman and Angela Olinto.  [Here&#8217;s a <a href="http://ccdb5fs.kek.jp/cgi-bin/img/allpdf?199010350" target="_blank">pdf of the paper</a>.] Such a field has the feature that it is periodic (i.e., if you change it by enough, it comes back to itself, the way an angle that can only range from 0 to 2π.)  It also has the feature that its interactions with all other fields are rather weak.  When this field varies a lot, the dark energy associated with it varies by quite a bit less&#8230; so the field could vary by something approaching the Planck scale yet the energy scale of the dark energy could stay rather constant, at one percent of the Planck energy.</p>
<p>In order for this idea to really be consistent with quantum gravity, it might require some modification, of the sort was introduced in 2008 by Liam McAllister, Eva Silverstein, and Alexander Westphal, in which the axion is periodic with a larger range than you&#8217;d naively expect.  <em>[They did this work in the context of string theory, but I don&#8217;t believe that string theory specifically is necessary for the idea to work; it might work in other consistent quantum gravity theories, if there are any.]  </em>Expect to hear much more about axions.  [By the way, it&#8217;s long been suggested that dark matter itself could be made from a type of axion&#8230; but presumably not the same one&#8230;]</p>

<p>Colleagues: what have I left out?  Eventually this post will be stored on this site as a reference article, so I&#8217;d like to make it complete.</p>
<p><strong>Final Remarks</strong></p>
<p>One more time I must remind you that we&#8217;re still some time away from trusting the BICEP2 result, and quite a long time from trusting the interpretation of the result in terms of inflation.   All of the implications I&#8217;ve mentioned are therefore provisional.   But the list is impressive, and there are probably more I have forgotten to mention, or are known to others but not to me, along with still others that haven&#8217;t yet been noticed by anyone.  So I don&#8217;t yet know if BICEP2&#8217;s measurement is right, or if inflation occurred and if it created the signal they observe, but I do know this: <strong><em>there&#8217;s a lot at stake</em></strong>.</p>
