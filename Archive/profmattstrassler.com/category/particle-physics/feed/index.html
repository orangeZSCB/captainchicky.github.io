										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Last Thursday, <a href="https://muon-g-2.fnal.gov/">an experiment reported</a> that the magnetic properties of the muon, the electron&#8217;s middleweight cousin, are a tiny bit different from what particle physics equations say they should be.  All around the world, the headlines screamed: <strong>PHYSICS IS BROKEN!!!</strong> And indeed, it&#8217;s been pretty shocking to physicists everywhere. For instance, my equations are working erratically; many of the calculations I tried this weekend came out upside-down or backwards.  Even worse, my stove froze my coffee instead of heating it, I just barely prevented my car from floating out of my garage into the trees, and my desk clock broke and spilled time all over the floor.  What a mess!</p>



<p>&#8212;</p>



<p>Broken, eh?  When we say a coffee machine or a computer is broken, it means it doesn&#8217;t work. It&#8217;s unavailable until it&#8217;s fixed.  When a glass is broken, it&#8217;s shattered into pieces.  We need a new one. I know it&#8217;s cute to say that so-and-so&#8217;s video &#8220;broke the internet.&#8221;  But aren&#8217;t we going a little too far now?  Nothing&#8217;s broken about physics; it works just as well today as it did a month ago.</p>



<p>More reasonable headlines have suggested that &#8220;the laws of physics have been broken&#8221;. That&#8217;s better; I know what it means to break a law.  (Though the metaphor is imperfect, since if I were to break a state law, I&#8217;d be punished, whereas if an object were to break a fundamental law of physics, that law would have to be revised!)  But as is true in the legal system, not all physics laws, and not all violations of law, are equally significant.  </p>



<p>What&#8217;s a physics law, anyway? Crudely, physics is a strategy for making predictions about the behavior of physical objects, based on a set of equations <em>and</em> a conceptual framework for using those equations.  Sometimes we refer to the equations as laws; sometimes parts of the conceptual framework are referred to that way.  </p>



<p>But that story has layers.   Physics has an underlying conceptual foundation, which includes the pillar of quantum physics and its view of reality, and the pillar of Einstein&#8217;s relativity and its view of space and time.  (There are other pillars too, such as those of statistical mechanics, but let me not complicate the story now.) That foundation supports many research areas of physics.  Within particle physics itself, these two pillars are combined into a more detailed framework, with concepts and equations that go by the name of &#8220;quantum effective field theory&#8221; (&#8220;QEFT&#8221;).  But QEFT is still very <strong>general</strong>; this framework can describe an enormous number of possible universes, most with completely different particles and forces from the ones we have in our own universe.  We can start making predictions for real-world experiments only when we put the electron, the muon, the photon, and all the other familiar particles and forces into our equations, building up a <strong>specific</strong> example of a QEFT known as &#8220;<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/">The Standard Model of particle physics</a>.&#8221;  </p>



<p>All along the way there are equations and rules that you might call &#8220;laws.&#8221;  They too come in layers.  The Standard Model itself, as a specific QEFT, has few high-level laws: there are no principles telling us why quarks exist, why there is one type of photon rather than two, or why the weak nuclear force is so weak.  The few laws it does have are mostly low-level, true of our universe but not essential to it.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m bringing attention to these layers because an experiment might cause a problem for one layer but not another.   I think you could only fairly suggest that &#8220;physics is broken&#8221; if data were putting a foundational pillar of the entire field into question.  And to say &#8220;the laws of physics have been violated&#8221;, emphasis on the word &#8220;<strong>the</strong>&#8220;, is a bit melodramatic if the only thing that&#8217;s been violated is a low-level, dispensable law.</p>



<p>&#8212;</p>



<p>Has physics, as a whole, <strong>ever</strong> broken?  You could argue that Newton&#8217;s 17th century foundation, which underpinned the next two centuries of physics, broke at the turn of the 20th century.   Just after 1900, Newton-style equations had to be replaced by equations of a substantially different type; the ways physicists used the equations changed, and the concepts, the language, and even the goals of physics changed. For instance, in Newtonian physics, you can predict the outcome of any experiment, at least in principle; in post-Newtonian quantum physics, you often can only predict the probability for one or another outcome, even in principle. And in Newtonian physics we all agree what time it is; in Einsteinian physics, different observers experience time differently and there is no universal clock that we all agree on.  These were immense changes in the foundation of the field.</p>



<p>Conversely, you could also argue that physics didn&#8217;t break; it was just remodeled and expanded.  No one who&#8217;d been studying steam engines or wind erosion or electrical circuit diagrams had to throw out their books and start again from scratch.  In fact this &#8220;broken&#8221; Newtonian physics is still taught in physics classes, and many physicists and engineers never use anything else.  If you&#8217;re studying the physics of weather, or building a bridge, Newtonian physics is just fine. The fact that Newton-style equations are an <strong>incomplete</strong> description of the world &#8212; that there are phenomena they can&#8217;t describe properly &#8212; doesn&#8217;t invalidate them when they&#8217;re applied within their wheelhouse.</p>



<p>No matter which argument you prefer, it&#8217;s hard to see how to justify the phrase &#8220;physics is broken&#8221; without a profound revolution that overthrows foundational concepts.  It&#8217;s rare for a serious threat to foundations to arise suddenly, because few experiments can single-handedly put fundamental principles at risk.  <em>[The infamous case of the &#8220;faster-than-light neutrinos&#8221; provides an exception.  Had that experiment been correct, it would have invalidated Einstein&#8217;s relativity principles. But few of us were surprised when <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/neutrinos-faster-than-light/opera-what-went-wrong/">a glaring error turned up</a>.]</em></p>



<p>&#8212;</p>



<p>In the Standard Model, the electron, muon and tau particles (known as the &#8220;charged leptons&#8221;) are all identical except for their masses. <em>(More fundamentally, they have different interactions with <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/">the Higgs field</a>, from which their rest masses arise.)</em>  This almost-identity is sometimes stated as a &#8220;principle of lepton universality.&#8221;  <strong><em>Oh, wow, a principle &#8212; a law!</em></strong>  But here&#8217;s the thing.  Some principles are enormously important; the principles of Einsteinian relativity determine how cause and effect work in our universe, and you can&#8217;t drop them without running into big paradoxes.  Other principles are weak, and could easily be discarded without making a mess of any other part of physics.  The principle of lepton universality is one of these.   In fact, if you extend the Standard Model by adding new particles to its equations, it can be difficult to <em>avoid</em> ruining this fragile principle.  <em>[In a sense, the Higgs field has already violated the principle, but we don&#8217;t hold that against it.]</em></p>



<p>All the fuss is about a new experimental result which confirms an older one and slightly disagrees with the latest theoretical predictions, which are made using the Standard Model&#8217;s equations.  What could be the cause of the discrepancy?  One possibility is that it arises from a previously unknown difference between muons and electrons &#8212; from a violation of the principle of lepton universality.  For those who live and breathe particle physics, breaking lepton universality would be a big deal; there&#8217;d be lots of adventure in trying to figure out which of the many possible extensions of the Standard Model could actually explain what broke this law. That&#8217;s why the scientists involved sound so excited.  </p>



<p>But the failure of  lepton universality wouldn&#8217;t come as a huge surprise. From certain points of view, the surprise is that the principle has survived this long!  Since this low-level law is easily violated, its demise may not lead us to a profound new understanding of the world. It&#8217;s way too early for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/07/science/particle-physics-muon-fermilab-brookhaven.html">headlines that argue that what&#8217;s at stake is the existence of &#8220;forms of matter and energy vital to the nature and evolution of the cosmos.&#8221;</a> No one can say how much is at stake; it might be a lot, or just a little.</p>



<p>In particular, there&#8217;s absolutely <em>no</em> evidence that <strong><em>physics</em></strong> is broken, or even that <strong><em>particle physics</em></strong> is broken.  The pillars of physics and QEFT are not (yet) threatened.  Even to say that &#8220;<strong><em>the Standard Model </em></strong>might be broken&#8221; seems a bit melodramatic to me.  Does adding a new wing to a house require &#8220;breaking&#8221; the house? Typically you can still live in the place while it&#8217;s being extended. The Standard Model&#8217;s many successes suggest that it might survive largely intact as a recognizable part of a larger, more complete set of equations.</p>



<p>In any case, right now it&#8217;s still too early to say <strong>anything</strong> so loudly.  The apparent discrepancy may not survive the heavy scrutiny it is coming under. There&#8217;s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2021/04/08/why-you-should-doubt-new-physics-from-the-latest-muon-g-2-results/?sh=4443b8616c4b">plenty of controversy</a> about the theoretical prediction for muon magnetism; the required calculation is extraordinarily complex, elaborate and difficult.  </p>



<p>So, from my perspective, the headlines of the past week are way over the top.  The idea that a single measurement of the muon&#8217;s magnetism could &#8220;<a href="https://www.livescience.com/muon-wobble-could-break-physics.html">shake physics to its core</a>&#8220;, as claimed in another headline I happened upon, is amusing at best.   Physics, and its older subdisciplines, have over time become very difficult to break, or even shake.  That&#8217;s the way it should be, when science is working properly.  And that&#8217;s why we can safely base the modern global economy on scientific knowledge; it&#8217;s unlikely that a single surprise could instantly invalidate large chunks of its foundation.</p>



<p>Some readers may view the extreme, click-baiting headlines as harmless.  Maybe I&#8217;m overly concerned about them. But don&#8217;t they implicitly suggest that one day we will suddenly find physics &#8220;upended&#8221;, and in need of a complete top-to-bottom overhaul?  To imply physics can &#8220;break&#8221; so easily makes a mockery of science&#8217;s strengths, and obscures the process by which scientific knowledge is obtained.  And how can it be good to claim &#8220;physics is broken&#8221; and &#8220;the laws of physics have been broken&#8221; over and over and over again, in stories that almost never merit that level of hype and eventually turn out to have been much ado about nada?  The constant manufacturing of scientific crisis cannot possibly be lost on readers, who I suspect are becoming increasingly jaded.   At some point readers may become as skeptical of science journalism, and the science it describes, as they are of advertising; <em>it&#8217;s all lies, so <strong>caveat emptor</strong></em>.   That&#8217;s not where we want our society to be.  As we are seeing in spades during the current pandemic, there can be serious consequences when &#8220;<strong>TRUST IN SCIENCE IS BROKEN!!!</strong>&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8212;</p>



<p><em>A final footnote: Ironically, the Standard Model itself poses one of the biggest threats to the framework of QEFT. The discovery of the Higgs boson <strong>and nothing else (so far)</strong> at the Large Hadron Collider poses a conceptual challenge &#8212; the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/naturalness/">&#8220;naturalness&#8221; problem</a>. There&#8217;s no sharp paradox, which is why I can&#8217;t promise you that the framework of QEFT will someday break if it isn&#8217;t resolved. But the breakdown of lepton universality might someday <strong>help</strong> solve the naturalness problem, by requiring a more &#8220;natural&#8221; extension of the Standard Model, and thus might actually <strong>save</strong> QEFT instead of &#8220;breaking&#8221; it.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There have been <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/22/world/fifth-force-of-nature-scn-trnd/index.html">dramatic articles</a> in the news media suggesting that a Nobel Prize has essentially already been awarded for the amazing discovery of a &#8220;fifth force.&#8221; I thought I&#8217;d better throw some cold water on that fire; it&#8217;s fine for it to smoulder, but we shouldn&#8217;t let it overheat.</p>
<p>There could certainly be as-yet unknown forces waiting to be discovered &#8212; dozens of them, perhaps.   So far, there are four well-studied forces:<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-forces-of-nature/"> gravity, electricity/magnetism, the strong nuclear force, and the weak nuclear force</a>.  Moreover, scientists are already fully confident <strong>there is a fifth force</strong>, predicted but not yet measured, that is generated by the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/">Higgs field</a>. So the current story would really be about a <strong><em>sixth</em> </strong>force.</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, any new force comes with at least one new particle.  That&#8217;s because</p>
<ul>
<li>every force arises from a type of field <em>(for instance, the electric force comes from the electromagnetic field, and the predicted Higgs force comes from the Higgs field)</em></li>
<li>and ripples in that type of field are a type of particle <em>(for instance, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/">a minimal ripple</a> in the electromagnetic field is a photon &#8212; a particle of light &#8212; and a minimal ripple in the Higgs field is the particle known as the Higgs boson.)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The current excitement, such as it is, arises because someone claims to have <strong>evidence for a new particle</strong>, whose properties would imply a previously unknown force exists in nature.  The force itself has not been looked for, much less discovered.</p>
<p>The new particle, if it really exists, would have a rest mass about 34 times larger than that of an electron &#8212; about 1/50th of a proton&#8217;s rest mass. In technical terms that means its E=mc² energy is about 17 million <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/">electron volts</a> (MeV), and that&#8217;s why physicists are referring to it as the X17.  But the question is whether the two experiments that find evidence for it are correct.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.01527">the first experiment, whose results appeared in 2015</a>, an experimental team mainly based in Debrecen, Hungary studied large numbers of <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-nuclei-of-atoms-at-the-heart-of-matter/">nuclei</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beryllium-8">beryllium-8</a> atoms, which had been raised to an &#8220;excited state&#8221; (that is, with more energy than usual).  An excited nucleus inevitably disintegrates, and the experimenters studied the debris.  On rare occasions they observed electrons and positrons [a.k.a. anti-electrons], and these behaved in a surprising way, as though they were produced in the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/why-do-particles-decay/most-particles-decay-why/">decay</a> of a previously unknown particle.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10459">newly reported experiment, whose results just appeared</a>, the same team observed  the disintegration of excited nuclei of helium.  They again found evidence for what they hope is the X17, and therefore claim confirmation of their original experiments on beryllium.</p>
<p>When two qualitatively different experiments claim the same thing, they are less likely to be wrong, because <strong><em>it&#8217;s not likely that any mistakes in the two experiments would create fake evidence of the same type</em></strong>.  On the face of it, it does seem unlikely that <strong>both</strong> measurements, carried out on two different nuclei, could fake an X17 particle.</p>
<p>However, we should remain cautious, because both experiments were carried out by the same scientists. They, of course, are hoping for their Nobel Prize (which, if their experiments are correct, they will surely win) and it&#8217;s possible they could suffer from unconscious bias. It&#8217;s very common for individual scientists to see what they want to see; scientists are human, and hidden biases can lead even the best scientists astray.  <strong>Only collectively, through the process of checking, reproducing, and using each other&#8217;s work, do scientists create trustworthy knowledge.</strong></p>
<p>So it is prudent to await efforts by other groups of experimenters to search for this proposed X17 particle.  If the X17 is observed by other experiments, then we&#8217;ll become confident that it&#8217;s real. But we probably won&#8217;t know until then.  I don&#8217;t currently know whether the wait will be months or a few years.</p>
<p>Why I am so skeptical? There are two distinct reasons.</p>
<p>First, there&#8217;s a conceptual, mathematical issue. It&#8217;s not easy to construct reasonable equations that allow the X17 to co-exist with all of the known types of elementary particles. That it has a smaller mass than a proton is not a problem per se.  But the X17 needs to have some unique and odd properties in order to (1)  be seen in these experiments, yet (2) not be seen in certain other previous experiments, some of which were explicitly looking for something similar.   To make equations that are consistent with these properties requires some complicated and not entirely plausible trickery.  Is it impossible? No.  But a number of the methods that scientists suggested were flawed, and the ones that remain are, to my eye, a bit contrived.</p>
<p>Of course, physics is an experimental science, and what theorists like me think doesn&#8217;t, in the end, matter.  If the experiments are confirmed, theorists will accept the facts and try to understand why something that seems so strange might be true.  But we&#8217;ve learned an enormous amount from mathematical thinking about nature in the last century &#8212; for instance, it was math that told us that the Higgs particle couldn&#8217;t be heavier than 1000 protons, and it was on the basis of that `advice&#8217; that the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">Large Hadron Collider</a> was built to look for it (and it found it, in 2012.) Similar math led to the discoveries of the W and Z particles roughly where they were expected. So when the math tells you the X17 story doesn&#8217;t look good, it&#8217;s not reason enough for giving up, but it is reason for some pessimism.</p>
<p>Second, there are many cautionary tales in experimental physics. For instance, back in 2003 there were claims of evidence of a particle called a <em>pentaquark</em> with a rest mass about 1.6 times a proton&#8217;s mass &#8212; an exotic particle, made from quarks and gluons, that&#8217;s both like and unlike a proton.  Its existence was confirmed by multiple experimental groups!  Others, however, didn&#8217;t see it. It took several years for the community to come to the conclusion that this pentaquark, which looked quite promising initially, did not in fact exist.</p>
<p>The point is that mistakes do get made in particle hunts, sometimes in multiple experiments, and it can take some time to track them down. It&#8217;s far too early to talk about Nobel Prizes.</p>
<p><em>[Note that the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-discovery-of-the-higgs/">Higgs boson&#8217;s discovery</a> was accepted more quickly than most.  It was discovered simultaneously by two distinct experiments using two methods each, and confirmed by additional methods and in larger data sets soon thereafter.  Furthermore,  there were already straightforward equations that happily accommodated it, so it was much more plausible than the X17.] </em></p>
<p>And just for fun, here&#8217;s a third reason I&#8217;m skeptical. It has to do with the number 17. I mean, come on, guys, seriously &#8212; <strong>17</strong> million electron volts? This just isn&#8217;t auspicious.  Back when I was a student, in the late 1980s and early 90s, there was a set of experiments, by a well-regarded experimentalist, which showed considerable evidence for an additional neutrino with a E=mc² energy of <strong>17</strong> <em>thousand</em> electron volts. Other experiments tried to find it, but couldn&#8217;t. Yet no one could find a mistake in the experimenter&#8217;s apparatus or technique, and he had good arguments that the competing experiments had their own problems. Well, after several years, the original experimenter discovered that there was a piece of his equipment which unexpectedly could absorb about 17 keV of energy, faking a neutrino signal. It was a very subtle problem, and most people didn&#8217;t fault him since no one else had thought of it either. But that was the end of the 17 keV neutrino, and with it went hundreds of research papers by both experimental and theoretical physicists, along with one scientist&#8217;s dreams of a place in history.</p>
<p>In short, history is cruel to most scientists who claim important discoveries, and teaches us to be skeptical and patient. If there is a <del>fifth</del> <strong>sixth</strong> force, we&#8217;ll know within a few years. Don&#8217;t expect to be sure anytime soon. The knowledge cycle in science runs much, much slower than the twittery news cycle, and that&#8217;s no accident; if you want to avoid serious errors that could confuse you for a long time to come, <strong>don&#8217;t rush to judgment</strong>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The untimely and sudden deaths of Steve Gubser and Ann Nelson, two of the United States&#8217; greatest talents in the theoretical physics of particles, fields and strings, has cast a pall over my summer and that of many of my colleagues.</p>
<p>I have not been finding it easy to write a proper memorial post for Ann, who was by turns my teacher, mentor, co-author, and faculty colleague.  I would hope to convey to those who never met her what an extraordinary scientist and person she was, but my spotty memory banks aren&#8217;t helping. Eventually I&#8217;ll get it done, I&#8217;m sure.</p>
<p><em>(Meanwhile I am afraid I cannot write something similar for Steve, as I really didn&#8217;t know him all that well. I hope someone who knew him better will write about his astonishing capabilities and his unique personality, and I&#8217;d be more than happy to link to it from here.)</em></p>
<p>In this context, I&#8217;m gratified to see that the New York Times has given Ann a substantive obituary, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/26/science/ann-nelson-dies.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/26/science/ann-nelson-dies.html</a>, and appearing in the August 28th print edition, I&#8217;m told. It contains a striking (but, to those of us who knew her, not surprising) quotation from Howard Georgi.  Georgi is a professor at Harvard who is justifiably famous as the co-inventor, with Nobel-winner Sheldon Glashow, of Grand Unified Theories (in which the electromagnetic, weak nuclear, and strong nuclear force all emerge from a single force.) He describes Ann, his former student, as being able to best him at his own game.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“I have had many fabulous students who are better than I am at many things. Ann was the only student I ever had who was better than I am at what I do best, and I learned more from her than she learned from me.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>He&#8217;s being a little modest, perhaps. But not much. There&#8217;s no question that Ann was an all-star.</p>
<p>And for that reason, I do have to complain about one thing in the Times obituary. It says &#8220;Dr. Nelson stood out in the world of physics not only because she was a woman, but also because of her brilliance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Really, NYTimes, really?!?</p>
<p>Any scientist who knew Ann would have said this instead: that Professor Nelson stood out in the world of physics for exceptional brilliance &#8212; lightning-fast, sharp, creative and careful, in the same league as humanity&#8217;s finest thinkers &#8212; and for remarkable character &#8212; kind, thoughtful, even-keeled, rigorous, funny, quirky, dogged, supportive, generous. Like most of us, Professor Nelson had a gender, too, which was female. There are dozens of female theoretical physicists in the United States; they are a too-small minority, but they aren&#8217;t rare. By contrast, a physicist and person like Ann Nelson, of <strong><em>any</em></strong> gender? They are extremely few in number across the entire planet, and they certainly do stand out.</p>
<p>But with that off my chest, I have no other complaints. (Well, admittedly the physics in the obit is rather garbled, but we can get that straight another time.) Mainly I am grateful that the Times gave Ann fitting public recognition, something that she did not actively seek in life. Her death is an enormous loss for theoretical physics, for many theoretical physicists, and of course for many other people. I join all my colleagues in extending my condolences to her husband, our friend and colleague David B. Kaplan, and to the rest of her family.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is beyond belief that not only am I <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2018/02/05/a-brilliant-light-disappears-over-the-horizon-in-memory-of-joe-polchinski/">again writing a post about the premature death of a colleague whom I have known for decades</a>, but that I am doing it about two of them.</p>
<p>Over the past weekend, two of the world&#8217;s most influential and brilliant theoretical high-energy physicists &#8212; Steve Gubser of Princeton University and Ann Nelson of the University of Washington &#8212; fell to their deaths in separate mountain accidents, one in the Alps and one in the Cascades.</p>
<p>Theoretical high energy physics is a small community, and within the United States itself the community is tiny.  Ann and Steve were both justifiably famous and highly respected as exceptionally bright lights in their areas of research. Even for those who had not met them personally, this is a stunning and irreplaceable loss of talent and of knowledge.</p>
<p>But most of us did know them personally.  For me, and for others with a personal connection to them, the news is devastating and tragic. I encountered Steve when he was a student and I was a postdoc in the Princeton area, and later helped bring him into a social group where he met his future wife (a great scientist in her own right, and a friend of mine going back decades).  As for Ann, she was one of my teachers at Stanford in graduate school, then my senior colleague on four long scientific papers, and then my colleague (along with her husband David B. Kaplan) for five years at the University of Washington, where she had the office next to mine. I cannot express what a privilege it always was to work with her, learn from her, and laugh with her.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have the heart or energy right now to write more about this, but I will try to do so at a later time. Right now I join their spouses and families, and my colleagues, in mourning.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://lhcb-public.web.cern.ch/lhcb-public/">LHCb experiment</a> at the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/">Large Hadron Collider</a> is dedicated mainly to the study of mesons <em>[objects made from a quark of one type, an anti-quark of another type, plus many other particles]</em> that contain <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/">bottom quarks</a> (hence the `b&#8217; in the name).  But it also can be used to study many other things, including mesons containing <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/">charm quarks</a>.</p>
<p>By examining large numbers of mesons that contain a charm quark and an up anti-quark (or a charm anti-quark and an up quark) and studying carefully how they <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/why-do-particles-decay/most-particles-decay-why/">decay</a>, the LHCb experimenters have discovered a new example of violations of <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/c-p-t-and-their-combinations/">the transformations known as CP</a> <em>(C: exchange of particle with anti-particle; P: reflection of the world in a mirror)</em>, of the sort that have been previously seen in mesons containing strange quarks and mesons containing bottom quarks.  Here&#8217;s <a href="https://home.cern/news/press-release/physics/lhcb-sees-new-flavour-matter-antimatter-asymmetry">the press release</a>.</p>
<p>Congratulations to LHCb!  This important addition to our basic knowledge is consistent with expectations; CP violation of roughly this size is predicted by the formulas that make up the Standard Model of Particle Physics.  However, our predictions are very rough in this context; it is sometimes difficult to make accurate calculations <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/protons-and-neutrons/">when the strong nuclear force</a>, which holds mesons (as well as protons and neutrons) together, is involved.  So this is a real coup for LHCb, but not a game-changer for particle physics.  Perhaps, sometime in the future, theorists will learn how to make predictions as precise as LHCb&#8217;s measurement!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A little while back I wrote a short post about some research that some colleagues and I did using &#8220;open data&#8221; from the Large Hadron Collider [LHC].

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A little while back I wrote a <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/02/13/breaking-a-little-new-ground-at-the-large-hadron-collider/">short post</a> about some research that some colleagues and I did using &#8220;open data&#8221; from the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC]. We used data made public by the <a href="https://home.cern/science/experiments/cms">CMS experimental collaboration</a> &#8212; about 1% of their current data &#8212; to search for a new particle, using a couple of twists (as proposed over 10 years ago) on a standard technique.  (CMS is one of the two general-purpose particle detectors at the LHC; the other is called ATLAS.)  We had two motivations: (1) Even if we didn&#8217;t find a new particle, we wanted to prove that our search method was effective; and (2) we wanted to stress-test the CMS Open Data framework, to assure it really does provide all the information needed for a search for something unknown.</p>
<p><a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/02/19/a-broad-search-for-fast-hidden-particles/">Recently I discussed</a> (1), and today I want to address (2): to convey why open data from the LHC is useful but controversial, and why we felt it was important, as theoretical physicists <em>(i.e. people who perform particle physics calculations, but do not build and run the actual experiments)</em>, to do something with it that is usually the purview of experimenters.</p>
<p><strong>The Importance of Archiving Data</strong></p>
<p>In many subfields of physics and astronomy, data from experiments is made public as a matter of routine. Usually this occurs after an substantial delay, to allow the experimenters who collected the data to analyze it first for major discoveries. That&#8217;s as it should be: the experimenters spent years of their lives proposing, building and testing the experiment, and they deserve an uninterrupted opportunity to investigate its data. To force them to release data immediately would create a terrible disincentive for anyone to do all the hard work!</p>
<p>Data from particle physics colliders, however, has not historically been made public. More worrying, it has rarely been archived in a form that is easy for others to use at a later date. I&#8217;m not the right person to tell you the history of this situation, but I can give you a sense for why this still happens today.<span id="more-10236"></span></p>
<p>The fundamental issue is the complexity of data sets from colliders, especially from <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-hadron-as-in-large-hadron-collider/">hadron</a> colliders such as the Tevatron and the LHC. (Archiving was partly done for <a href="https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-electron-positron-collider">LEP</a>, a simpler collider, and was used in later studies including <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1003.0705">this search for unusual Higgs decays</a>  and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06536">this controversial observation,</a> also <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2016/10/21/hiding-from-a-nightmare/">discussed here</a>.) What &#8220;complexity&#8221; are we talking about? Collisions of <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/">protons</a> and/or anti-protons are intrinsically complicated; particles of all sorts go <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/2114779/files/diphoton_v0.png">flying in all directions</a>. The general purpose particle detectors ATLAS and CMS have a complex shape and aren&#8217;t uniform. (Here&#8217;s <a href="https://cms.cern/detector">a cutaway image showing CMS as a set of nested almost-cylinders</a>. Note also that there are inherent weak points: places where cooling tubes have to run, where bundles of wires have to bring signals in and out of the machine, and where segments of the detector join together.) Meanwhile the interactions of the particles with the detector&#8217;s material is messy and often subtle (here&#8217;s <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/2270046/files/Figure_001.png">a significantly oversimplified view</a>). Not every particle is detected, and the probability of missing one depends on where it passes through the detector and what type of particle it is.</p>
<p>Even more important, 99.999% percent of ATLAS and CMS data is discarded as it comes in; only data which passes a set of filters, collectively called <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/the-trigger-discarding-all-but-the-gold/">the &#8220;trigger,&#8221;</a> will even be stored. The trigger is adjusted regularly as experimental conditions change. If you don&#8217;t understand these filters in detail, you can&#8217;t understand the data. Meanwhile the strategies for processing the raw data change over time, becoming more sophisticated, and introducing their own issues that must be known and managed.</p>
<p>I could easily go on (did I mention that at the LHC <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/1479324/files/198609-56-3565522e.png">dozens of collisions occur simultaneously?</a>) If, when you explore the data, you fail to account for all these issues, you can mistake a glitch for a new physical effect, or fail to observe a new physical effect because a glitch obscured it. Any experimentalist inside the collaborations is aware of most of these subtleties, and is surrounded by other experts who will be quick to complain if he or she forgets to account for one of them. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s rare for the experimenters to report a result that has this type of error embedded in it.</p>
<p>Now,<strong><em> imagine writing a handbook that would encapsulate all of that combined knowledge, for use by people who will someday analyze the data without having access to that collective human library.</em></strong> This handbook would accompany an enormous data set taken in changing conditions, and would need to contain everything a person could possibly need to know in order to properly analyze data from an LHC experiment without making a technical error.</p>
<p><strong>Not easy!</strong> But this is what the <a href="http://opendata.cern.ch/">Open Data project at CERN</a>, in which CMS is one of the participating experiments, aims to do. Because it&#8217;s extremely difficult, and therefore expensive in personnel and time, its value has to be clear.</p>
<p>I personally do think the value <strong><em>is</em></strong> clear, especially at the LHC. Until the last couple of decades, one could argue that data from an old particle physics experiment would go out of date so quickly, superseded by better experiments, that it really wasn&#8217;t needed. But this argument has broken down as experiments have become more expensive, with new ones less frequent. There is no guarantee, for instance, that any machine superseding the LHC will be built during my lifetime; it is a minimum of 20 and perhaps 40 years away. In all that time, the LHC&#8217;s data will be the state of the art in proton-proton collider physics, so it ought to be stored so that experts can use it 25 years from now. The price for making that possible has to be paid.</p>
<p><em>[This price was not paid for the Tevatron, whose data, which will remain the gold standard for <strong>proton-antiproton</strong> collisions for perhaps a century or more, is not well-archived.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Was Using Open Data Necessary For Our Project?</strong></p>
<p>Even if we all agree that it&#8217;s important to archive LHC data so that it can be used by future experimental physicists, it&#8217;s not obvious that <strong><em>today&#8217;s theorists</em> </strong>should use it. There&#8217;s an alternative: a theorist with a particular idea can temporarily join one of the experimental collaborations, and carry out the research with like-minded experimental colleagues. In principle, this is a much better way to do things; it permits access to the full data set, it allows the expert experimentalists to handle and manage the data instead of amateurs like us, and it should in principle lead to state-of-the-art results.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t found this approach to work. I&#8217;ve been recommending the use of our technique <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/02/19/a-broad-search-for-fast-hidden-particles/"><em>[selecting events where the transverse momentum of the muon and antimuon pair is large, and often dropping isolation requirements]</em></a> for over ten years, along with several related techniques. These remarks appear in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0712.2041">papers</a>; I&#8217;ve mentioned these issues in <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/94815/contributions/1282671/">many talks</a>, discussed them in detail with at least two dozen experimentalists at ATLAS and CMS (including many colleagues at Harvard), and even started a preliminary project with an experimenter to study them. But everyone had a reason not to proceed. I was told, over and over again, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, we&#8217;ll get to this next year.&#8221; After a decade of this, I came to feel that perhaps it would be best if we carried out the analysis ourselves.</p>
<p>Even then, there was an alternative: we could have just done a study of our method using simulated data, and this would have proved the value of our technique. Why spend the huge amount of time and effort to do a detailed analysis, on a fraction of the real data?</p>
<p>First, I worried that a study on simulated data would be no more effective than all of the talks I gave and all the personal encouraging I did over the previous ten years. I think seeing the study done for real has a lot more impact, because it shows explicitly how effective the technique is and how easily it is implemented. <em>[Gosh, if even theorists can do it&#8230;]</em></p>
<p>Second, one of the things we did in our study is include &#8220;non-isolated muons&#8221; &#8212; muons that have other particles close by &#8212; which are normally not included in theorists&#8217; studies. Dropping the usual isolation criteria may be essential for discoveries of hidden particles, as Kathryn Zurek and I have emphasized since 2006 (and studied in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0712.2041">a paper with Han and Si, in 2007</a>). I felt it was important to show this explicitly in our study. But we needed the real data to do this; simulation of the background sources for non-isolated muons would not have been accurate. <em>[The experimenters rarely use non-isolated muons in the type of analysis we carried out, but notably <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01890">have been doing so here</a>; my impression is that they were unaware of our work from 2007 and came to this approach independently.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Stress Testing the Archive</strong></p>
<p>A further benefit to using the real data was that we stress-tested the archiving procedure in the Open Data project, and to do this fully, we had to carry out our analysis to the very end. The success or failure of our analysis was a test of whether the CMS Open Data framework truly provides all the information needed to do a complete search for something unknown.</p>
<p>The test received a passing grade, with qualifications. Not only we did complete the project, we were able to repeat a rather precise measurement of the (well-known) cross-section for Z boson production, which would have failed if the archive and the accompanying information had been unusable. That said, there is room for improvement: small things were missing, including some calibration information and some simulated data. The biggest issue is perhaps the format for the data storage (difficult to use and unpack for a typical user).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to recognize that the persons in charge of Open Data at CMS have a huge and difficult job; they have to figure out how to write the nearly impossible handbook I referred to above. It&#8217;s therefore crucial that people like our group of theorists actually use the open data sets <em><strong>now</strong></em>, not just after the LHC is over. <em><strong>Now</strong></em>, when the open data sets are still small, is the time to figure out what information is missing, to determine how to improve the data storage, to fill out the documentation and make sure it has no gaps. We hope we&#8217;ve contributed something to that process.</p>
<p><strong>The Future</strong></p>
<p>Should others follow in our footsteps? Yes, I think, though not lightly. In our case, five experts required two years to do the simplest possible study; we could have done it in one year if we&#8217;d been more efficient, but probably not much less. Do not underestimate what this takes, both in terms of understanding the data and learning how to do statistical analysis that most people rarely undertake.</p>
<p>But there are studies that simply cannot be done without real data, and unless you can convince an experimentalist to work with you, your only choice may be to dive in and do your best. And if you are already somewhat informed, but want to learn more about how real experimental analysis is done, so you can appreciate more fully what is typically hidden from view, you will not find a better self-training ground. If you want to take it on, I suggest, as an initial test, that you try to replicate our measurement of the Z boson cross-section. If you can&#8217;t, you&#8217;re not ready for anything else.</p>
<p>I should emphasize that Open Data is a resource that can be used in other ways, and several groups have already done this. In addition to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05842">detailed studies</a> of <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/jets-the-manifestation-of-quarks-and-gluons/">jets</a> carried out on the <em><strong>real</strong></em> data by my collaborators, led by Professor Jesse Thaler, there have been <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11916">studies</a> that have relied solely on the archive of <em><strong>simulated</strong></em> data also provided by the CMS Open Data project. These have value too, in that they offer proving grounds for techniques to be applied later to real data. Since exploratory studies of simulated data don&#8217;t require the extreme care that analysis of real data demands, there may be a lot of potential in this aspect of the Open Data project.</p>
<p>In the end, our research study, like most analyses, is just a drop in the huge bucket of information learned from the LHC. Its details should not obscure the larger question: <em><strong>how shall we, as a community, maintain the LHC data set so that it can continue to provide information across the decades?</strong></em> Maybe the Open Data project is the best approach.  If so, how can we best support it?  And if not, what is the alternative?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few days ago I wrote <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/02/13/breaking-a-little-new-ground-at-the-large-hadron-collider/">a quick summary of a project that we just completed</a> (and you may find it helpful to read that post first). In this project, we looked for new particles at the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">Large Hadron Collider</a> (LHC) in a novel way, in two senses. Today I&#8217;m going to explain what we did, why we did it, and what was unconventional about our search strategy.</p>
<p>The first half of this post will be appropriate for any reader who has been following particle physics as a spectator sport, or in some similar vein. In the second half, I&#8217;ll add some comments for my expert colleagues that may be useful in understanding and appreciating some of our results.  <em>[If you just want to read the comments for experts, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/02/19/a-broad-search-for-fast-hidden-particles/#experts">jump here</a>.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Why did we do this?</strong></p>
<p>Motivation first. Why, as theorists, would we attempt to take on the role of our experimental colleagues &#8212; to try on our own to analyze the extremely complex and challenging data from the LHC? We&#8217;re by no means experts in data analysis, and we were very slow at it. And on top of that, we only had access to 1% of the data that CMS has collected. Isn&#8217;t it obvious that there is no chance whatsoever of finding something new with just 1% of the data, since the experimenters have had years to look through much larger data sets?<span id="more-10224"></span></p>
<p>Not only isn&#8217;t it obvious, it&#8217;s <strong>false</strong>. In an immense data set, unexpected phenomena can hide, and if you ask the wrong questions, they may not reveal themselves. This has happened before, and it will happen again.</p>
<p>Conventional thinking, before the LHC and still today, is that new phenomena will likely appear in the form of particles with large rest masses. The logic? You <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/naturalness/">can&#8217;t easily explain</a> the patterns of particles in the Standard Model without adding some new, slightly heavier ones.  Crudely speaking, this would lead you to look for particles with the largest rest masses you can reach, which is limited by the energy of your machine, because of E=mc². That&#8217;s why the LHC was expected to find more than just the Higgs particle, and why the machine proposed for the post-LHC era at CERN is a larger copy of the LHC, with more energy in each collision.</p>
<p>This point of view is based on strong, reasonable arguments; please don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m criticizing it as foolish. But there have long been cracks in those arguments. Studies of so-called &#8220;gauge-mediated&#8221; supersymmetry breaking in the mid 1990s, which revealed a vast world of previously ignored phenomena. The discovery of the cosmological constant in 1998, which clearly violated conventional reasoning. The possibilities of relatively large unobserved dimensions of space (which we, like blind flies stuck between panes of glass, can&#8217;t detect), which showed how little confidence we should have in what we think we know. The model known as the Twin Higgs in 2005, which showed how the new heavy particles might exist, but could hide from the LHC.</p>
<p>In this context, it should not have been a total shock &#8212; just a painful one &#8212; that so far the LHC has not <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-discovery-of-the-higgs/">found anything other than a Higgs boson</a>, using conventional searches.</p>
<p>Indeed, the whole story of my 30-year career has been watching the conventional reasoning gradually break down. I cannot explain why some of my colleagues were so confident in it, but I hope their depression medication is working well. I myself view the evisceration of conventional wisdom as potentially very exciting, as well as very challenging.</p>
<p>And if you&#8217;re a bit unconventional, you might wonder whether particles that are insensitive to all the known forces (except gravity) might have an unexpected role to play in explaining the mysteries of particle physics. Importantly, <em><strong>these (and only these) types of particles could have arbitrarily low rest mass and yet have escaped discovery up to now.<br />
</strong></em></p>
<p>This unconventional thinking has made some headway into the LHC community, and there have been quite a number of searches for these &#8220;hidden&#8221; particles. <strong>BUT</strong>&#8230; not nearly enough of them.  The problem is that (a) such particles might be produced in any of a hundred different ways, and (b) they might disintegrate (&#8220;<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/why-do-particles-decay/most-particles-decay-why/">decay</a>&#8221;) in any of a hundred different ways, meaning that there are many thousands of different ways they might show up in our experiments. Don&#8217;t quote me on the numbers here; they&#8217;re for effect. The point is that there&#8217;s a lot of work to do if we&#8217;re going to be sure that we did a thorough search for hidden particles. And one thing I can assure you: this work has not yet been done.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the number of searches required is a lot smaller than thousands&#8230; but still large: dozens, probably. The simplest one of them &#8212; one that even theorists could do, and barely qualifying as &#8220;unconventional&#8221; &#8212; is to look for a hidden particle that (1) decays sometimes to a muon/anti-muon pair, and (2) is initially produced with a hard kick&#8230; like shrapnel from an explosion. In colloquial terms, we might say that it&#8217;s faster than typical, perhaps very close to the speed of light. In Physicese, it has substantial <em><strong>momentum</strong> [and at the LHC we have to look for momentum perpendicular (&#8220;transverse&#8221;) to the proton beams.]<br />
</em></p>
<p>There&#8217;s an obvious way to look for fast hidden particles, and it requires only one simple step beyond the conventional. And if you take that step, you have a much better chance of success than if you take the conventional route&#8230; so much better than in some cases you might find something, even with 1% of the data, that nobody had yet noticed. And even if you find nothing, you might convince the experts that this is an excellent approach, worth applying on the big data sets.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s <em><strong>why</strong></em> we did it. Now a few more details.</p>
<p><strong>What we did</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing new about looking for new particles that sometimes decay to muon/anti-muon pairs; several particles have been discovered this way, including the Z boson and the Upsilon (a mini-atom made from a bottom quark/anti-quark pair.) It&#8217;s not even particularly unconventional to look for that pair to carry a lot of transverse momentum. But to use these as the<strong><em> only</em></strong> requirements in a search &#8212; this is a bit unconventional, and to my knowledge has not been done before.</p>
<p>Why add this unconventional element in the first place? Because, as Kathryn Zurek and I emphasized long ago, the best way to discover low-mass hidden particles is often to look for them in the decay of a heavier particle; it may be the most common way they are produced, and even if it isn&#8217;t, it&#8217;s often the most spectacular production mechanism, and thus the easiest to detect. Indeed, when a particle is produced in the decay of another, it often acts like shrapnel &#8212; it goes flying.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s hard to detect such a particle (let&#8217;s call it &#8220;V&#8221;, because of the shape the muon and anti-muon make in the picture below) if it decays before it has moved appreciably from the location where it was created. In that case, your only clue of its existence is <strong><em>the shrapnel&#8217;s shrapnel</em></strong>: the muon and anti-muon that appear when the V itself decays. And by itself, that&#8217;s not enough information. Many of the proton-proton collisions at the LHC make a muon and anti-muon pair for a variety of random reasons. How, then, can one find evidence for the V, if its muon/anti-muon pair look just like other random processes that happen all the time?</p>

<p>One key trick is that the new particle&#8217;s muon/anti-muon pair isn&#8217;t random: the energies and momenta of the muon and anti-muon always have a very special relationship, characteristic of the rest mass of the V particle. <em>[Specifically: the &#8220;<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-invariant-mass/">invariant mass</a>&#8221; of the muon/anti-muon pair equals the V rest mass.]</em> And so, we use the fact that this special relationship rarely holds for the random background, but it always holds for the signal.  We don&#8217;t know the V mass, but we do know that the signal itself always reflects it.</p>
<p>The problem (both qualitatively and quantitatively) is much like trying to hear someone singing on your car radio while stuck in a deafening city traffic jam. As long as the note being sung is loud and clear enough, and the noise isn&#8217;t too insane, it&#8217;s possible.</p>
<p>But what if it&#8217;s not? Well, you might try some additional tricks. Noise reduction headphones, for example, would potentially cancel some of the traffic sound, making the song easier to hear. And that&#8217;s a vague analogy to what we are doing when we require the muon and anti-muon be from a fast particle. Most of the random processes that make muon/anti-muon pairs make a <em>slow pair</em>. [The individual muon and anti-muon move quickly, but together they look as though they came from something slow.] By removing those muon/anti-muon pairs that are slow, in this sense, we remove much of the random &#8220;background&#8221; while leaving much of the signal from any new particle of the sort we&#8217;re looking for.</p>
<p>Searches for particles like V have come mainly in two classes. Either (1) no noise-cancelling tricks are applied, and one just tries to cope with the full set of random muon/anti-muon pairs, or (2) a precise signal is sought in a highly targeted matter, and every trick one can think of is applied. Approach (1), extremely broad but shallow, has the advantage of being very simple, but the disadvantage that what you&#8217;re looking for might be lost in the noise. Approach (2), deep but narrow, has the advantage of being extremely powerful for the targeted signal, but the disadvantage that many other interesting signals are removed by one or another of the too-clever tricks.  So if you use the approach (2), you may need a different search strategy for each target.</p>
<p>Our approach tries to maintain tremendous breadth while adding some more depth. And the reason this is possible is that the trick of requiring substantial momentum can reduce the size of the background &#8220;noise&#8221; by factors of 5, 25, 100 &#8212; depending on how much momentum one demands. These are big factors! <em>[Which is important, because when you reduce background by 100, you usually only gain sensitivity to your signal by 10.]</em> So imposing this sort of requirement can make it somewhat easier to find signals from fast hidden particles.</p>
<p>Using this approach, we were able to search for fast hidden short-lived particles and exclude them <em><strong>without exception</strong></em> across a wide range of masses and down to smaller production rates than anyone has in the past. The precise bounds still need to be worked out in particular cases, but it&#8217;s clear that while, as expected, we do less well than targeted searches for particular signals, we often do 2 to 10 times better than a conventional broad search. And that benefit of our method over the conventional approach should apply also to ATLAS and CMS when they search in their full data sets.</p>
<p><a id="experts"></a><br />
<strong>Some Additional Technical Remarks for our Experimental Colleagues:</strong></p>
<p>Now, for my expert colleagues, some comments about our results and where one can take them next. I&#8217;ll reserve most of my thoughts on our use of open data, and why open data is valuable, for my next post&#8230; with one exception.</p>
<p><strong>Isolation Or Not</strong></p>
<p>Open data plays a central role in our analysis at the point where we drop the muon isolation criterion and replace it with something else.  We considered two ways of reducing QCD background (muons from heavy quark decays and fake muons);</p>
<ul>
<li>the usual one, requiring the muons and anti-muons be isolated from other particles,</li>
<li>dropping the isolation criterion on muons altogether, and replacing it with a cut on the promptness of the muon (i.e. on the impact parameter).</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>With real data to look at, we were able to establish that by tightening the promptness requirement alone, one can reduce QCD until it is comparable to the Drell-Yan background, with minimal loss of signal.</strong></em> And that means a price of no more than √2 in sensitivity. So if chasing a potential signal whose muons are isolated &lt; 85% of the time (i.e. a dimuon isolation efficiency &lt; 70%) one may be better off dropping the isolation criterion and replacing it with a promptness criterion. [Of course there&#8217;s a great deal of in-between, such as demanding one fully isolated lepton and imposing promptness and loose isolation on the other.]</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to think of reasonable signals where each muon is isolated less than 85% of the time; indeed, as Kathryn Zurek and I emphasized back in 2006, a feature of many relevant hidden sector models (&#8220;hidden valleys&#8221; or &#8220;dark sectors&#8221;, as they are often known) is that particles emerge in clusters, creating non-standard jets. So it is quite common, in such theories, that the isolation criterion should be dropped (see for example <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0712.2041">this study from 2007</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>Our Limits</strong></p>
<p>Our main results are model-independent limits on the product of the cross-section for V production, the probability for V to decay to muons, and the acceptance and efficiency for the production of V.  To apply our limits, these quantities must be computed within a particular signal model. We&#8217;ve been working so hard to iron out our results that we really haven&#8217;t had time yet to look carefully at their detailed implications. But there are a few things already worth noting.</p>
<p>We briefly compared our model-independent results to targeted analyses by ATLAS and CMS for a simple model: Higgs decaying to two pseudoscalars <em><strong>a</strong></em>, one of which decays to a bottom quark/anti-quark pair and one to a muon/anti-muon pair. (More generally we considered <em>h<strong>→</strong></em>V<em><strong>a</strong></em> where V, decaying to muons, may have a different mass from <strong><em>a</em></strong>). If the V and <em><strong>a</strong></em> mass are both 40 GeV, our limits lag the targeted limits by a factor of 15-20.  But the targeted limits used 10-20 times as much data as we had.  One may then estimate that <strong><em>with identical data sets</em></strong>, the difference between our approach and theirs would likely be somewhere between 5 and 10.</p>
<p>Conversely, there are many models to which the targeted limits don&#8217;t apply; if <em><strong>a</strong></em> usually decays to gluons, or the <em><strong>a</strong></em> mass is so low that its decay products merge, we still set the same limit, while the published experimental analyses, which require two b-tagged jets, do not.</p>
<p>Thus broad analyses and deep analyses are complementary, and both are needed.</p>
<p><strong>The wiggle at 29.5 GeV and what to do about it</strong></p>
<p>In our limit plots, we have a few excesses, as one would expect with such a detailed mass scan. The only interesting excess (which is not the most significant) is found in a sample with no isolation criterion and a cut of 25 GeV on the dimuon pair &#8212; and what makes it interesting is that it is at 29.5 GeV (and locally 2.7σ) which is quite near to a couple of other curious excesses (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06536">from ALEPH data</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01890">by CMS</a>) that we&#8217;ve heard about in the last couple of years.  Probably it&#8217;s nothing, but just in case, let me say a few cautious words about it.</p>

<p>So let&#8217;s imagine there were a new particle (I&#8217;ll keep calling it V) with mass of about 29 GeV.  What would we already know about it?</p>
<p>The excess we see at 29.5 GeV does not appear in the isolated sample, which overlaps the prompt sample but is half its size (see the figure above left), and it&#8217;s not visible with a transverse momentum cut of 60 GeV.  That means it could only be consistent with a signal with transverse momentum in the 25-50 GeV range, and with often-non-isolated leptons.</p>
<p>If it is produced with bottom (<em>b</em>) quarks all of the time, then there&#8217;s no question that CMS&#8217;s studies, which require a <em>b</em>-tagged jet, are much more sensitive than we are, and there&#8217;s no chance, if they have only a ~3σ excess, that we would see any hint of it.</p>
<p><em><strong>But if instead V is usually produced with <span style="color:#ff0000;">no</span> b quarks, then the CMS analysis could be missing most of the events.</strong> </em>We, in our model-independent analysis, would miss far fewer. And in that context, it&#8217;s possible we would see a hint in our analysis at the same time CMS sees a hint in theirs, despite having much less data available.</p>
<p>Moreover, since the muons must often be non-isolated (and as mentioned above, there are many models where this happens naturally) other searches that require isolated leptons (e.g. multilepton searches) might have less sensitivity than one might initially assume.</p>
<p>Were this true, then applying our analysis <em>[with little or no isolation requirement, and a promptness cut]</em> to the full Run II data set would immediately reveal this particle. Both ATLAS or CMS would see it easily.   So this is not a question we need to debate or discuss. There&#8217;s plenty of data; we just need to see the results of our methodology applied to it.</p>
<p>It would hardly be surprising if someone has looked already, in the past or present, by accident or by design.  Nevertheless, there will be considerable interest in seeing a public result.</p>
<p><strong>Looking Beyond This Analysis</strong></p>
<p>First, a few obvious points:</p>
<ul>
<li>We only used muons, but one could add electrons; for a spin-one V, this would help.</li>
<li>Our methods would also work for photon pairs (for which there&#8217;s more experience because of the Higgs, though not at low mass) as appropriate for spin-0 and spin-2 parent particles.</li>
<li>Although we applied our approach below the Z peak and above the upsilon, there&#8217;s no reason not to extend it above or below. We refrained only because we had too little data above the Z peak to do proper fits, and below the Upsilon the muons were so collimated that our results would have been affected by the losses in the dimuon trigger efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<p>More generally, the device of reducing backgrounds through a transverse momentum cut (or a transverse boost cut) is only one of several methods that are motivated by hidden sector models. As I have emphasized in many talks, <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/94815/contributions/1282671/">for instance here</a>, others include:</p>
<p>1) <strong>cutting on the number of jets</strong> [each additional jet reduces background by a factor of several, depending on the jet pt cut]. This works because Drell-Yan and even dileptonic top have few jets on average, and it works on QCD to a lesser extent. It is sensitive to models where the V is produced by a heavy particle (or particle pair) that typically produces many jets. Isolation is often reduced in this case, so a loose isolation criterion (or none) may be necessary. Of course one could also impose a cut on the <strong>number of b tags.</strong></p>
<p>2) <strong>cutting on the total transverse energy in the event</strong>, often called S_T. This works because in Drell-Yan, S_T is usually of the same order as the dimuon mass. It (probably) doesn&#8217;t remove much QCD unless the isolation criterion is applied, and there will still be plenty of top background. It&#8217;s best for models where the V is produced by a heavy particle (or particle pair) but the V momentum is often not high, the number of jets is rather small, and the events are rare.</p>
<p>3) <strong>cutting on the missing transverse energy in the event</strong>, which works because it&#8217;s small in Drell-Yan and QCD. This of course is done in many supersymmetry studies and elsewhere, but no model-independent limits on V production has been shown publicly.  This is a powerful probe of models where some hidden particles are very long-lived, or often decay invisibly.</p>
<p>All of these approaches can be applied to muon pairs, electron pairs, photon pairs &#8212; even tau pairs and bottom-jet pairs, for that matter.  Each of them can provide an advantage in reducing backgrounds and allowing more powerful model-independent searches for resonances. And in each case, there are signals that might have been missed in other analyses that could show up first in these searches.  More theoretical and experimental studies are needed, but in my opinion, many of these searches need to be done on Run II data before there can be any confidence that the floor has been swept clean.</p>
<p>[There is at least one more subtle example: <strong>cutting on the number of tracks</strong>. Talk to me about the relevant signals if you&#8217;re curious.]</p>
<p>Of course, <strong>multi-lepton searches</strong> are a powerful tool for finding V as well. All you need is one stray lepton &#8212; and then you plot the dimuon (or dielectron) mass. Unfortunately <em><strong>we rarely see limits on V + lepton as a function of the V mass, but it would be great if they were made available</strong></em>, because they would put much stronger constraints on relevant models than one can obtain by mere counting of 3-lepton events.</p>
<p><strong>A subtlety: The question of how to place cuts</strong></p>
<p>A last point for the diehards: one of the decisions that searches of this type require is where exactly to make the cuts &#8212; or alternatively, how to bin the data? Should our first cut on the transverse momentum be at 25 or 35 GeV? and having made this choice, where should the next cut be? Without a principle, this choice introduces significant arbitrariness into the search strategy, with associated problems.</p>
<p>This question is itself crude, and surely there are more sophisticated statistical methods for approaching the issue. There is also the question of whether to bin rather than cut. But I did want to point out that we proposed an answer, in the form of a rough principle, which one might call a &#8220;2-5&#8221; rule, illustrated in the figure below. The idea is that a signal at the 2 sigma level at one cut should be seen at the 5 sigma level after the next, stricter cut is applied; this requires each cut successively reduce the background by roughly a factor of (5/2)².  Implicitly, in this calculation we assume the stricter cut removes no signal. That assumption is less silly than it sounds, because the signals to which we are sensitive often have a characteristic momentum scale, and cuts below that characteristic scale have slowly varying acceptance.  We showed some examples of this in section V of our paper.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, a small but intrepid band of theoretical particle physicists (professor Jesse Thaler of MIT, postdocs Yotam Soreq and Wei Xue of CERN, Harvard Ph.D. student Cari Cesarotti, and myself) put out <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04222">a paper</a> that is unconventional in two senses. First, we looked for new particles at the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">Large Hadron Collider</a> in a way that hasn&#8217;t been done before, at least in public. And second, we looked for new particles at the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">Large Hadron Collider</a> in a way that hasn&#8217;t been done before, at least in public.</p>
<p>And no, there&#8217;s no error in the previous paragraph.</p>
<p>1) We used a small amount of <strong>actual data from the <a href="https://home.cern/science/experiments/cms">CMS experiment</a></strong>, even though we&#8217;re not ourselves members of the CMS experiment, to do a search for a new particle. Both ATLAS and CMS, the two large multipurpose experimental detectors at the Large Hadron Collider [LHC], have made a small fraction of their proton-proton collision data public, through a website called the <a href="http://opendata.cern.ch/">CERN Open Data Portal</a>. Some experts, including my co-authors Thaler, Xue and their colleagues, have used this data (and the simulations that accompany it) to do a variety of important studies involving known particles and their properties. [Here&#8217;s <a href="http://cylindricalonion.web.cern.ch/blog/201712/future-particle-physics-open">a blog post by Thaler concerning Open Data and its importance from his perspective.</a>] But our new study is the first to <strong><em>look for signs of a new particle in this public data</em></strong>. While our chances of finding anything were low, we had a larger goal: to see whether Open Data could be used for such searches. We hope our paper provides some evidence that Open Data offers a reasonable path for preserving priceless LHC data, allowing it to be used as an archive by physicists of the post-LHC era.</p>
<p>2) Since only had a tiny fraction of CMS&#8217;s data was available to us, about 1% by some count, how could we have done anything useful compared to what the LHC experts have already done? Well, that&#8217;s why we examined the data in a slightly unconventional way (one of <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/94815/contributions/1282671/">several methods that I&#8217;ve advocated for many years</a>, but has not been used in any public study). Consequently it allowed us to explore some ground that no one had yet swept clean, and even have a tiny chance of an actual discovery! But the larger scientific goal, absent a discovery, was <strong>to prove the value of this unconventional strategy</strong>, in hopes that the experts at CMS and ATLAS will use it (and others like it) in future. Their chance of discovering something new, using their full data set, is vastly greater than ours ever was.</p>
<p>Now don&#8217;t all go rushing off to download and analyze terabytes of CMS Open Data; you&#8217;d better know what you&#8217;re getting into first. It&#8217;s worthwhile, but it&#8217;s not easy going. LHC data is extremely complicated, and until this project I&#8217;ve always been skeptical that it could be released in a form that anyone outside the experimental collaborations could use. Downloading the data and turning it into a manageable form is itself a major task. Then, while studying it, there are an enormous number of mistakes that you can make (and we made quite a few of them) and you&#8217;d better know how to make lots of cross-checks to find your mistakes (which, fortunately, we did know; we hope we found all of them!) The CMS personnel in charge of the Open Data project were enormously helpful to us, and we&#8217;re very grateful to them; but since the project is new, there were inevitable wrinkles which had to be worked around. And you&#8217;d better have some friends among the experimentalists who can give you advice when you get stuck, or point out aspects of your results that don&#8217;t look quite right. [Our thanks to them!]</p>
<p>All in all, this project took us two years! Well, honestly, it should have taken half that time &#8212; but it couldn&#8217;t have taken much less than that, with all we had to learn. So trying to use Open Data from an LHC experiment is not something you do in your idle free time.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I feel it was worth it. At a personal level, I learned a great deal more about how experimental analyses are carried out at CMS, and by extension, at the LHC more generally. And more importantly, we were able to show what we&#8217;d hoped to show: that <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em><strong>there are still tremendous opportunities for discovery at the LHC</strong></em></span>, through the use of (even slightly) unconventional model-independent analyses. It&#8217;s a big world to explore, and we took only a small step in the easiest direction, but perhaps our efforts will encourage others to take bigger and more challenging ones.</p>
<p>For those readers with greater interest in our work, I&#8217;ll put out more details in two blog posts over the next few days: one about what we looked for and how, and one about our views regarding the value of open data from the LHC, not only for our project but for the field of particle physics as a whole.</p>
