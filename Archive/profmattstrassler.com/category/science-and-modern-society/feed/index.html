										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Last Thursday, <a href="https://muon-g-2.fnal.gov/">an experiment reported</a> that the magnetic properties of the muon, the electron&#8217;s middleweight cousin, are a tiny bit different from what particle physics equations say they should be.  All around the world, the headlines screamed: <strong>PHYSICS IS BROKEN!!!</strong> And indeed, it&#8217;s been pretty shocking to physicists everywhere. For instance, my equations are working erratically; many of the calculations I tried this weekend came out upside-down or backwards.  Even worse, my stove froze my coffee instead of heating it, I just barely prevented my car from floating out of my garage into the trees, and my desk clock broke and spilled time all over the floor.  What a mess!</p>



<p>&#8212;</p>



<p>Broken, eh?  When we say a coffee machine or a computer is broken, it means it doesn&#8217;t work. It&#8217;s unavailable until it&#8217;s fixed.  When a glass is broken, it&#8217;s shattered into pieces.  We need a new one. I know it&#8217;s cute to say that so-and-so&#8217;s video &#8220;broke the internet.&#8221;  But aren&#8217;t we going a little too far now?  Nothing&#8217;s broken about physics; it works just as well today as it did a month ago.</p>



<p>More reasonable headlines have suggested that &#8220;the laws of physics have been broken&#8221;. That&#8217;s better; I know what it means to break a law.  (Though the metaphor is imperfect, since if I were to break a state law, I&#8217;d be punished, whereas if an object were to break a fundamental law of physics, that law would have to be revised!)  But as is true in the legal system, not all physics laws, and not all violations of law, are equally significant.  </p>



<p>What&#8217;s a physics law, anyway? Crudely, physics is a strategy for making predictions about the behavior of physical objects, based on a set of equations <em>and</em> a conceptual framework for using those equations.  Sometimes we refer to the equations as laws; sometimes parts of the conceptual framework are referred to that way.  </p>



<p>But that story has layers.   Physics has an underlying conceptual foundation, which includes the pillar of quantum physics and its view of reality, and the pillar of Einstein&#8217;s relativity and its view of space and time.  (There are other pillars too, such as those of statistical mechanics, but let me not complicate the story now.) That foundation supports many research areas of physics.  Within particle physics itself, these two pillars are combined into a more detailed framework, with concepts and equations that go by the name of &#8220;quantum effective field theory&#8221; (&#8220;QEFT&#8221;).  But QEFT is still very <strong>general</strong>; this framework can describe an enormous number of possible universes, most with completely different particles and forces from the ones we have in our own universe.  We can start making predictions for real-world experiments only when we put the electron, the muon, the photon, and all the other familiar particles and forces into our equations, building up a <strong>specific</strong> example of a QEFT known as &#8220;<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/">The Standard Model of particle physics</a>.&#8221;  </p>



<p>All along the way there are equations and rules that you might call &#8220;laws.&#8221;  They too come in layers.  The Standard Model itself, as a specific QEFT, has few high-level laws: there are no principles telling us why quarks exist, why there is one type of photon rather than two, or why the weak nuclear force is so weak.  The few laws it does have are mostly low-level, true of our universe but not essential to it.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m bringing attention to these layers because an experiment might cause a problem for one layer but not another.   I think you could only fairly suggest that &#8220;physics is broken&#8221; if data were putting a foundational pillar of the entire field into question.  And to say &#8220;the laws of physics have been violated&#8221;, emphasis on the word &#8220;<strong>the</strong>&#8220;, is a bit melodramatic if the only thing that&#8217;s been violated is a low-level, dispensable law.</p>



<p>&#8212;</p>



<p>Has physics, as a whole, <strong>ever</strong> broken?  You could argue that Newton&#8217;s 17th century foundation, which underpinned the next two centuries of physics, broke at the turn of the 20th century.   Just after 1900, Newton-style equations had to be replaced by equations of a substantially different type; the ways physicists used the equations changed, and the concepts, the language, and even the goals of physics changed. For instance, in Newtonian physics, you can predict the outcome of any experiment, at least in principle; in post-Newtonian quantum physics, you often can only predict the probability for one or another outcome, even in principle. And in Newtonian physics we all agree what time it is; in Einsteinian physics, different observers experience time differently and there is no universal clock that we all agree on.  These were immense changes in the foundation of the field.</p>



<p>Conversely, you could also argue that physics didn&#8217;t break; it was just remodeled and expanded.  No one who&#8217;d been studying steam engines or wind erosion or electrical circuit diagrams had to throw out their books and start again from scratch.  In fact this &#8220;broken&#8221; Newtonian physics is still taught in physics classes, and many physicists and engineers never use anything else.  If you&#8217;re studying the physics of weather, or building a bridge, Newtonian physics is just fine. The fact that Newton-style equations are an <strong>incomplete</strong> description of the world &#8212; that there are phenomena they can&#8217;t describe properly &#8212; doesn&#8217;t invalidate them when they&#8217;re applied within their wheelhouse.</p>



<p>No matter which argument you prefer, it&#8217;s hard to see how to justify the phrase &#8220;physics is broken&#8221; without a profound revolution that overthrows foundational concepts.  It&#8217;s rare for a serious threat to foundations to arise suddenly, because few experiments can single-handedly put fundamental principles at risk.  <em>[The infamous case of the &#8220;faster-than-light neutrinos&#8221; provides an exception.  Had that experiment been correct, it would have invalidated Einstein&#8217;s relativity principles. But few of us were surprised when <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/neutrinos-faster-than-light/opera-what-went-wrong/">a glaring error turned up</a>.]</em></p>



<p>&#8212;</p>



<p>In the Standard Model, the electron, muon and tau particles (known as the &#8220;charged leptons&#8221;) are all identical except for their masses. <em>(More fundamentally, they have different interactions with <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/">the Higgs field</a>, from which their rest masses arise.)</em>  This almost-identity is sometimes stated as a &#8220;principle of lepton universality.&#8221;  <strong><em>Oh, wow, a principle &#8212; a law!</em></strong>  But here&#8217;s the thing.  Some principles are enormously important; the principles of Einsteinian relativity determine how cause and effect work in our universe, and you can&#8217;t drop them without running into big paradoxes.  Other principles are weak, and could easily be discarded without making a mess of any other part of physics.  The principle of lepton universality is one of these.   In fact, if you extend the Standard Model by adding new particles to its equations, it can be difficult to <em>avoid</em> ruining this fragile principle.  <em>[In a sense, the Higgs field has already violated the principle, but we don&#8217;t hold that against it.]</em></p>



<p>All the fuss is about a new experimental result which confirms an older one and slightly disagrees with the latest theoretical predictions, which are made using the Standard Model&#8217;s equations.  What could be the cause of the discrepancy?  One possibility is that it arises from a previously unknown difference between muons and electrons &#8212; from a violation of the principle of lepton universality.  For those who live and breathe particle physics, breaking lepton universality would be a big deal; there&#8217;d be lots of adventure in trying to figure out which of the many possible extensions of the Standard Model could actually explain what broke this law. That&#8217;s why the scientists involved sound so excited.  </p>



<p>But the failure of  lepton universality wouldn&#8217;t come as a huge surprise. From certain points of view, the surprise is that the principle has survived this long!  Since this low-level law is easily violated, its demise may not lead us to a profound new understanding of the world. It&#8217;s way too early for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/07/science/particle-physics-muon-fermilab-brookhaven.html">headlines that argue that what&#8217;s at stake is the existence of &#8220;forms of matter and energy vital to the nature and evolution of the cosmos.&#8221;</a> No one can say how much is at stake; it might be a lot, or just a little.</p>



<p>In particular, there&#8217;s absolutely <em>no</em> evidence that <strong><em>physics</em></strong> is broken, or even that <strong><em>particle physics</em></strong> is broken.  The pillars of physics and QEFT are not (yet) threatened.  Even to say that &#8220;<strong><em>the Standard Model </em></strong>might be broken&#8221; seems a bit melodramatic to me.  Does adding a new wing to a house require &#8220;breaking&#8221; the house? Typically you can still live in the place while it&#8217;s being extended. The Standard Model&#8217;s many successes suggest that it might survive largely intact as a recognizable part of a larger, more complete set of equations.</p>



<p>In any case, right now it&#8217;s still too early to say <strong>anything</strong> so loudly.  The apparent discrepancy may not survive the heavy scrutiny it is coming under. There&#8217;s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2021/04/08/why-you-should-doubt-new-physics-from-the-latest-muon-g-2-results/?sh=4443b8616c4b">plenty of controversy</a> about the theoretical prediction for muon magnetism; the required calculation is extraordinarily complex, elaborate and difficult.  </p>



<p>So, from my perspective, the headlines of the past week are way over the top.  The idea that a single measurement of the muon&#8217;s magnetism could &#8220;<a href="https://www.livescience.com/muon-wobble-could-break-physics.html">shake physics to its core</a>&#8220;, as claimed in another headline I happened upon, is amusing at best.   Physics, and its older subdisciplines, have over time become very difficult to break, or even shake.  That&#8217;s the way it should be, when science is working properly.  And that&#8217;s why we can safely base the modern global economy on scientific knowledge; it&#8217;s unlikely that a single surprise could instantly invalidate large chunks of its foundation.</p>



<p>Some readers may view the extreme, click-baiting headlines as harmless.  Maybe I&#8217;m overly concerned about them. But don&#8217;t they implicitly suggest that one day we will suddenly find physics &#8220;upended&#8221;, and in need of a complete top-to-bottom overhaul?  To imply physics can &#8220;break&#8221; so easily makes a mockery of science&#8217;s strengths, and obscures the process by which scientific knowledge is obtained.  And how can it be good to claim &#8220;physics is broken&#8221; and &#8220;the laws of physics have been broken&#8221; over and over and over again, in stories that almost never merit that level of hype and eventually turn out to have been much ado about nada?  The constant manufacturing of scientific crisis cannot possibly be lost on readers, who I suspect are becoming increasingly jaded.   At some point readers may become as skeptical of science journalism, and the science it describes, as they are of advertising; <em>it&#8217;s all lies, so <strong>caveat emptor</strong></em>.   That&#8217;s not where we want our society to be.  As we are seeing in spades during the current pandemic, there can be serious consequences when &#8220;<strong>TRUST IN SCIENCE IS BROKEN!!!</strong>&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8212;</p>



<p><em>A final footnote: Ironically, the Standard Model itself poses one of the biggest threats to the framework of QEFT. The discovery of the Higgs boson <strong>and nothing else (so far)</strong> at the Large Hadron Collider poses a conceptual challenge &#8212; the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/naturalness/">&#8220;naturalness&#8221; problem</a>. There&#8217;s no sharp paradox, which is why I can&#8217;t promise you that the framework of QEFT will someday break if it isn&#8217;t resolved. But the breakdown of lepton universality might someday <strong>help</strong> solve the naturalness problem, by requiring a more &#8220;natural&#8221; extension of the Standard Model, and thus might actually <strong>save</strong> QEFT instead of &#8220;breaking&#8221; it.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The cost to American science and healthcare of the administration&#8217;s attack on legal immigration is hard to quantify.  Maybe it will prevent a terrorist attack, though that&#8217;s hard to say.  What is certain is that American faculty are suddenly no longer able to hire the best researchers from the seven countries currently affected by the ban.  Numerous top scientists suddenly cannot travel here to share their work with American colleagues; or if already working here, cannot now travel abroad to learn from experts elsewhere&#8230; not to mention visiting their families.  Those caught outside the country cannot return, hurting the American laboratories where they are employed.</p>
<p>You might ask what the big deal is; it&#8217;s only seven countries, and the ban is temporary. Well (even ignoring the outsized role of Iran, whose many immigrant engineers and scientists are here <em>because</em> they dislike the ayatollahs and their alternative facts), the impact extends far beyond these seven.</p>
<p>The administration&#8217;s tactics are chilling.  Scientists from certain countries now fear that one morning they will discover their country has joined the seven, so that they too cannot hope to enter or exit the United States.  They will decide now to turn down invitations to work in or collaborate with American laboratories; it&#8217;s too risky.  At the University of Pennsylvania, I had a Pakistani postdoc, who made important contributions to our research effort. At the University of Washington we hired a terrific Pakistani mathematical physicist. Today, how could I advise someone like that to accept a US position?</p>
<p>Even those not worried about being targeted may decide the US is not the open and welcoming country it used to be.  Many US institutions are currently hiring people for the fall semester.  A lot of bright young scientists &#8212; not just Muslims from Muslim-majority nations &#8212; will choose instead to go instead to Canada, to the UK, and elsewhere, leaving our scientific enterprise understaffed.</p>
<p>Well, but this is just about science, yes?  Mostly elite academics presumably &#8212; it won&#8217;t affect the average person.  Right?</p>
<p>Wrong.  It will affect many of us, because it affects healthcare, and in particular, hospitals around the country.  I draw your attention to an article written by an expert in that subject:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/29/opinions/trump-ban-impact-on-health-care-vox/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/29/opinions/trump-ban-impact-on-health-care-vox/index.html</a></p>
<p>and I&#8217;d like to quote from the article (highlights mine):</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Our training hospitals posted job listings for <span style="color:#ff0000;">27,860</span> new medical graduates last year alone, but American medical schools only <a href="http://www.nrmp.org/press-release-results-of-2016-nrmp-main-residency-match-largest-on-record-as-match-continues-to-grow/" target="_blank">put out</a> <span style="color:#ff0000;">18,668</span> graduates. International physicians percolate throughout the entire medical system. To highlight just one particularly intense specialty, fully 30% of American <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27619016" target="_blank">transplant surgeons started their careers in foreign medical schools</a>. Even with our current influx of international physicians as well as steadily growing domestic medical school spots, the Association of American Medical Colleges <a href="https://www.aamc.org/download/458082/data/2016_complexities_of_supply_and_demand_projections.pdf" target="_blank">estimates </a>that we&#8217;ll be short by up to 94,700 doctors by 2025.</em></p>
<div class="el__embedded el__embedded--standard">
<div class="el__storyelement--standard el__article--embed">
<div class="media__caption el__storyelement__title">
<p><em>The President&#8217;s decision is as ill-timed as it was sudden. The initial 90-day order encompasses Match Day, the already anxiety-inducing third Friday in March when medical school graduates officially commit to their clinical training programs. Unless the administration or the courts quickly fix the mess President Trump just created, <span style="color:#ff0000;">many American hospitals could face staffing crises come July</span> when new residents are slated to start working.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>If you or a family member has to go into the hospital this summer and gets sub-standard care due to a lack of trained residents and doctors, you know who to blame.  Terrorism is no laughing matter, but you and your loved ones are vastly more likely to die due to a medical error than due to a terrorist.  It&#8217;s hard to quantify exactly, but it is clear that over the years since 2000, <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/05/03/476636183/death-certificates-undercount-toll-of-medicalhttp://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/05/03/476636183/death-certificates-undercount-toll-of-medical-errors-errors">the number of Americans dying of medical errors is in the <strong>millions</strong></a>, while the number who died from terrorism is just over three<strong> thousand</strong> during that period, almost all of whom died on 9/11 in 2001. So addressing the terrorism problem by worsening a hospital problem probably endangers Americans more than it protects them.</p>
<p>Such is the problem of relying on alternative facts in place of solid scientific reasoning.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2017/01/23/whats-all-this-fuss-about-having-alternatives/">My satire about &#8220;alternative facts&#8221; from yesterday</a> took some flak for propagating the controversial photos of inaugurations that some say are real and some say aren&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t honestly care one bit about those photos. I think it is of absolutely no importance how many people went to Trump&#8217;s inauguration; it has no bearing on how he will perform as president, and frankly I don&#8217;t know why he&#8217;s making such a big deal out of it. Even if attendance was far less than he and his people claim, it could be for two very good reasons that would not reflect badly on him at all.</p>
<p>First, Obama&#8217;s inauguration was extraordinarily historic. For a nation with our horrific past &#8212;  with most of our dark-skinned citizens brought to this continent to serve as property and suffer under slavery for generations &#8212; it was a huge step to finally elect an African-American president. I am sure many people chose to go to the 2009 inauguration because it was special to them to be able to witness it, and to be able to say that they were there. Much as many people adore Trump, it&#8217;s not so historic to have an aging rich white guy as president.</p>
<p>Second, look at a map of the US, with its population distribution. A huge population with a substantial number of Obama&#8217;s supporters live within driving distance or train distance of Washington DC. From South Carolina to Massachusetts there are large left-leaning populations. Trump&#8217;s support was largest in the center of the US, but people would not have been able to drive from there or take a train. The cost of travel to Washington could have reduced Trump&#8217;s inauguration numbers without reflecting on his popularity.</p>
<p>So as far as I&#8217;m concerned, it really doesn&#8217;t make any difference if Trump&#8217;s inauguration numbers were small, medium or large. It doesn&#8217;t count in making legislation or in trade negotiations; it doesn&#8217;t count in anything except pride.</p>
<p>But what does count, especially in foreign affairs, is whether people listen to what a president says, and by extension to what his or her press secretary says. What bothers me is not the political spinning of facts. All politicians do that. What bothers me is the claim of having hosted &#8220;the best-attended inauguration ever&#8221; without showing any convincing evidence, and the defense of those claims (and we heard it again today) that this is because <em>it&#8217;s ok to disagree with facts</em>.</p>
<p>If facts can be chosen at will, even in principle, then science ceases to function. Science &#8212; a word that means &#8220;evidence-based reasoning applied logically to determine how reality really works&#8221; &#8212; depends on the existence and undeniability of evidence. It&#8217;s not an accident that physics, unlike some subjects, does not have a Republican branch and a Democratic branch; it doesn&#8217;t have a Muslim, Christian, Buddhist or Jewish branch;  there&#8217;s just one type.  I work with people from many countries and with many religious and political beliefs; we work together just fine, and we don&#8217;t have discussions about &#8220;alternative facts.&#8221;</p>
<p>If instead you give up evidence-based reasoning, then soon you have politics instead of science determining your decisions on all sorts of things that matter to people because it can hurt or kill them: food safety, road safety, airplane safety, medicine, energy policy, environmental protection, and most importantly, defense. A nation that abandons evidence is abandoning applied reason and logic; and the inevitable consequence is that people will die unnecessarily.  It&#8217;s not a minor matter, and it&#8217;s not outside the purview of scientists to take a stand on the issue.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I find the context for this discussion almost as astonishing as the discussion itself. It&#8217;s one thing to say unbelievable things during a campaign, but it&#8217;s much worse once in power. For the press secretary on day two of a new administration to make an astonishing and striking claim, but provide unconvincing evidence, has the effect of completely undermining his function.  As every scientist knows by heart, <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence</span>.</strong>  Imagine the press office at the CERN laboratory announcing the discovery of the Higgs particle without presenting plots of its two experiments&#8217; data; or imagine if the LIGO experimenters had claimed discovery of gravitational waves but shown no evidence.  Mistakes are going to happen, but they have to be owned: imagine if OPERA&#8217;s tentative suggestion of neutrinos-faster-than-light, which was an experimental blunder, or BICEP&#8217;s loud misinterpretation of their cosmological data, had not been publicly retracted, with a clear public explanation of what happened.  When an organization makes a strong statement but won&#8217;t present clear evidence in favor, and isn&#8217;t willing to retract the statement when shown evidence against it, it not only introduces immediate suspicion of the particular claim but creates a wider credibility problem that is extremely difficult to fix.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-discovery-of-the-higgs/higgs-discovery-the-data/">Higgs boson has been observed by two different experiments</a>, in two different data-taking runs of both experiments; the evidence is extraordinary.  And <a href="https://losc.ligo.org/events/GW150914/">LIGO&#8217;s gravitational waves data is public</a>; you can check it yourself, and moreover there will be plenty of opportunities for further verification as <a href="http://public.virgo-gw.eu/language/en/">Advanced VIRGO comes on-line</a> this year.    But the inauguration claim hasn&#8217;t been presented with extraordinary evidence in its favor, and there&#8217;s significant contradictory evidence (from train ridership and from local sales).    When something extraordinary is actually true, it&#8217;s true from all points of view, not subject to &#8220;alternative facts&#8221;; and <strong>the person claiming it has the responsibility</strong> to find evidence, of several different types, as soon as possible.  If firm evidence is lacking, the claim should only be made tentatively.  (A single photo isn&#8217;t convincing, one way or the other, especially nowadays.)</p>
<p>As any child knows, it&#8217;s like crying wolf.  If your loud claim isn&#8217;t immediately backed up, or isn&#8217;t later retracted with a public admission of error, then the next time you claim something exceptional, people will just laugh and ignore you.  And nothing&#8217;s worse than suggesting that &#8220;I have my facts and you have yours;&#8221; that&#8217;s the worst possible argument, used only when firm evidence simply isn&#8217;t available.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t understand why a press secretary would blow his credibility so quickly on something of so little importance.  But he did it.  If the new standards are this low, can one expect truth on anything that actually matters?  It&#8217;s certainly not good for Russia that few outside the country believe a word that Putin says; speaking for myself, I would never invest a dollar there. Unfortunately, leaders and peoples around the world, learning that the new U.S. administration has &#8220;alternative facts&#8221; at its disposal, may already have drawn the obvious conclusion.    <em>[The extraordinary claim that &#8220;3-5 million&#8221; non-citizens (up from 2-3 million, the previous version of the claim) voted in the last election, also presented without extraordinary evidence, isn&#8217;t helping matters.]</em> There&#8217;s now already a risk that only the president&#8217;s core supporters will believe what comes from this White House, even in a time of crisis or war.</p>
<p>Of course all governments lie sometimes.  But it&#8217;s wise to tell the truth most of the time, so that your occasional lies will sometimes be thought to be true.  Governments that lie constantly, even pointlessly, aren&#8217;t believed even when they say something true.  They&#8217;ve cried wolf too often.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s next?  Made-up numbers for inflation, employment, the budget deficit, tax revenue? Invented statistics for the number of people who have health insurance?  False information about the readiness of our armed forces and the cost of our self-defense?  How far will this go?  And how will we know?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t know what all the fuss is about &#8220;alternative facts.&#8221; Why, we scientists use them all the time!</p>
<p>For example, because of my political views, I teach physics students that gravity pulls down. That&#8217;s why the students I teach, when they go on to be engineers, put wheels on the bottom corners of cars, so that the cars don&#8217;t scrape on the ground. But in some countries, the physicists teach them that gravity pulls whichever way the country&#8217;s leaders instruct it to. That&#8217;s why their engineers build flying carpets as transports for their country&#8217;s troops. It&#8217;s a much more effective way to bring an army into battle, if your politics allows it.  We ought to consider it here.</p>
<p>Another example: in my physics class I claim that energy is &#8220;conserved&#8221; (in the physics sense) &#8212; it is never created out of nothing, nor is it ever destroyed. In our daily lives, energy is taken in with food, converted into special biochemicals for storage, and then used to keep us warm, maintain the pumping of our hearts, allow us to think, walk, breathe &#8212; everything we do. Those are my facts. But in some countries, the facts and laws are different, and energy can be created from nothing. The citizens of those countries never need to eat; it is a wonderful thing to be freed from this requirement. It&#8217;s great for their military, too, to not have to supply food for troops, or fuel for tanks and airplanes and ships. Our only protection against invasion from these countries is that if they crossed our borders they&#8217;d suddenly need fuel tanks.</p>
<p>Facts are what you make them; it&#8217;s entirely up to you. You need a good, well-thought-out system of facts, of course; otherwise they won&#8217;t produce the answers that you want. But just first figure out what you want to be true, and then go out and find the facts that make it true. That&#8217;s the way science has always been done, and the best scientists all insist upon this strategy.  As a simple illustration, compare the photos below.  Which picture has more people in it?   Obviously, the answer depends on what facts you&#8217;ve chosen to use.   [Picture copyright Reuters]  If you can&#8217;t understand that, you&#8217;re not ready to be a serious scientist!</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d44bf9ac740cfa2e4c015e985cf20e4ec8d6fdc9/r=540/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove3/29906170001/201701/2306/29906170001_5290953783001_5290938262001-vs.jpg" /></p>
<p>A third example: when I teach physics to students, I instill in them the notion that quantum mechanics controls the atomic world, and underlies the transistors in every computer and every cell phone. But the uncertainty principle that arises in quantum mechanics just isn&#8217;t acceptable in some countries, so they don&#8217;t factualize it. They don&#8217;t use seditious and immoral computer chips there; instead they use proper vacuum tubes. One curious result is that their computers are the size of buildings. The CDC advises you not to travel to these countries, and certainly not to take electronics with you. Not only might your cell phone explode when it gets there, you yourself might too, since your own molecules are held together with quantum mechanical glue. At least you should bring a good-sized bottle of our local facts with you on your travels, and take a good handful before bedtime.</p>
<p>Hearing all the naive cries that facts aren&#8217;t for the choosing, I became curious about what our schools are teaching young people. So I asked a friend&#8217;s son, a bright young kid in fourth grade, what he&#8217;d been learning about alternatives and science. Do you know what he answered?!  I was shocked. &#8220;Alternative facts?&#8221;, he said. &#8220;You mean <strong>lies</strong>?&#8221; Sheesh. Kids these days&#8230; What are we teaching them? It&#8217;s a good thing we&#8217;ll soon have a new secretary of education.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I find that some people just don&#8217;t believe scientists when we point out that fundamental research has spin-off benefits for modern society.  The assumption often seems to be that it&#8217;s just a bunch of egghead esoteric researchers trying to justify their existence.  It&#8217;s a real problem when those scoffing at our evidence are congresspeople of the United States and their staffers, or other members of governmental funding agencies around the world.</p>
<p>So I thought I&#8217;d point out an example, reported on Bloomberg News.  It&#8217;s a good illustration of how these things often work out, and it is very rare indeed that they are discussed in the press.</p>
<p>Gravitational waves are usually incredibly tiny effects [typically squeezing the radius of our planet by less than the width of an atomic nucleus] that can be made only with monster black holes and neutron stars.   There&#8217;s not much hope of using them in technology.  So what good could <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2016/06/15/ligo-detects-a-second-merger-of-black-holes/">an experiment to discover them, such as LIGO</a>, possibly be for the rest of the world?</p>
<p>Well, Shell Oil seems to have found some value in it.   It&#8217;s not in the gravitational waves themselves, of course; instead, it is in the technology that has to be developed to detect something so delicate.   <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-07/shell-is-using-innoseis-s-sensors-to-detect-gravitational-waves">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-07/shell-is-using-innoseis-s-sensors-to-detect-gravitational-waves</a></p>
<p>Score another one for investment in fundamental scientific research.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Readers are probably wondering what&#8217;s become of me, and all I can say is that career challenges are occupying 120% of my time. I do miss the writing, and hope I will get back to it soon, though it seems unlikely it will be before December.  So it is all the more unfortunate that today&#8217;s post has almost nothing to do with science at all. It is an apology.</p>
<p>Which is weird. I have nothing to apologize for, and yet I have to apologize to everyone on my contacts list for the unsolicited invitation they received to become my contact on LinkedIn. Or rather, LinkedIn needs to apologize, but they won&#8217;t, so I have to do it.<span id="more-7764"></span></p>
<p>I use LinkedIn sparingly, though I have found it beneficial on occasion. But one of its features is that its software is constantly asking you if you want to make LinkedIn-contact with people whom it thinks you might know. That&#8217;s understandable; LinkedIn has to make money, and information and contacts are money for them. But there&#8217;s one LinkedIn request that you have to be careful with, in which they ask for permission to import your contacts lists and send LinkedIn invitations to make contact with every single person on that list. I don&#8217;t have to explain to you why this would typically be undesirable&#8230; it&#8217;s obvious. Just think of one person you&#8217;d rather not talk to, or who&#8217;d rather not hear from you, who might be down in a forgotten corner of your list of contacts.</p>
<p>In the old days, if you were to plan something so drastic as contacting hundreds of unrelated people on a single day about joining your professional network, you&#8217;d be discussing it on the phone or at a desk with a company representative, having a conversation. And you&#8217;d probably have to sign a piece of paper. Moreover, you&#8217;d have at least a few minutes, if not days, to consider what you&#8217;d done and change your mind.</p>
<p>In the modern age &#8212; ok, here&#8217;s our one connection to science, which provides us with incredible speed and automation &#8212; clicking is enough. But everyone knows that it is easy to misread something and click on it, or do something through accidental clicking of a touch-pad, a slip of a mouse, or a bump of a touchscreen. I don&#8217;t know which of these happened to me yesterday. In any case, in order to take an action as outlandish and irrevocable as sending blanket faux-personalized email invitations to everyone I have ever known, it is essential for a company to have a warning pop-up: &#8220;<strong>This action will send email invitations to 452 individuals. Are you sure you want to do this?</strong>&#8221; The default should be &#8220;<strong>No</strong>&#8220;, and you have to click on &#8220;<strong>Yes</strong>&#8221; for the action to go ahead.</p>
<p>But for LinkedIn, as I discovered yesterday, a single click is apparently all it takes, with no warning screen.  In my opinion, this is somewhere between unethical, negligent, and sneaky.</p>
<p>Actually let&#8217;s just call it <em>evil</em>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also extremely stupid.</p>
<p>First, it forced me to issue a broad apology to everyone who might be on my contacts list for some reason &#8212; an apology for LinkedIn&#8217;s inappropriate activity, and for my own inability to prevent it.  I considered sending 452 separate emails, or a blanket email to 452 people, but decided that a blog post would be much easier to arrange, somewhat less time-consuming, and slightly less embarrassing.</p>
<p>Second, seeing the irreparable disarray in my LinkedIn account caused by yesterday&#8217;s debacle, and considering the numerous embarrassing professional and personal situations that LinkedIn (which purports to help careers!) had created in a single stroke, I decided my best bet was to permanently delete the account, and do no more business with LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Is there a science-and-society lesson here?  Maybe not.  Companies have been using subterfuge to take advantage of consumers for generations, and consumers have been fighting back however they can, often by boycotting those companies and by word-of-mouth criticism.   That said, the speedy, efficient electrons of our electronic age have made it all much more public and more immediate &#8212; for good and for evil.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why did so few people see auroras on Friday night, after all the media hype? You can see one of two reasons in the data. <a title="Auroras — Quantum Physics in the Sky — Tonight?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/09/12/auroras-quantum-physics-in-the-sky-tonight/" target="_blank">As I explained in my last post</a>, you can read what happened in the data shown in the Satellite Environment Plot from <a href="http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/" target="_blank">this website</a> <em>(warning &#8212; they&#8217;re going to make new version of the website soon, so you might have to modify this info a bit.)</em> Here&#8217;s what the plot looked like Sunday morning.</p>

Friday is at left.  Time shown is &#8220;Universal&#8221; time (UTC); New York time is 4 hours later at this time of year. There were two storms, shown as the red bars in the Kp index chart (fourth line); one occurred very early Friday morning and one later on Friday. You can see the start of the second storm in the &#8220;GOES Hp&#8221; chart (third line), where the magnetic field goes wild very suddenly. The storm was subsiding by midnight Universal time, so it was mostly over by midnight New York time.</p></div></p>
<p>What the figure shows is that after a first geomagnetic storm very early Friday, a strong geomagnetic storm started (as shown by the sharp jump in the GOES Hp chart) later on Friday, a little after noon New York time [&#8220;UTC&#8221; is currently New York + 4/5 hours], and that it was short &#8212; mostly over before midnight. Those of you out west never had a chance; it was all over before the sun set. Only people in far western Europe had good timing. Whatever the media was saying about later Friday night and Saturday night was somewhere between uninformed and out of date.  Your best bet was to be looking at this chart, which would have shown you that (despite predictions, which for auroras are always quite uncertain) there was nothing going on after Friday midnight New York time.</p>
<p>But the second reason is something that the figure doesn&#8217;t show. Even though this was a strong geomagnetic storm (the Kp index reached 7, the strongest in quite some time), the auroras didn&#8217;t migrate particularly far south. They were seen in the northern skies of Maine, Vermont and New Hampshire, but not (as far as I know) in Massachusetts. Certainly I didn&#8217;t see them. That just goes to show you <em>(AccuWeather, and other media, are you listening?)</em> that predicting the precise timing and extent of auroras is educated guesswork, and will remain so until current knowledge, methods and information are enhanced. One simply can&#8217;t know for sure how far south the auroras will extend, even if the impact on the geomagnetic field is strong.</p>
<p>For those who did see the auroras on Friday night, <a href="http://spaceweathergallery.com/indiv_upload.php?upload_id=101829&amp;PHPSESSID=gqkuvfv22at9icg8c240bjun15" target="_blank">it was quite a sight</a>. And for the rest of us who didn&#8217;t see them this time, there&#8217;s no reason for us to give up. Solar maximum is not over, and even though this is a rather weak sunspot cycle, the chances for more auroras over the next year or so are still pretty good.</p>
<p>Finally, a lesson for those who went out and stared at the sky for hours after the storm was long over &#8212; get your scientific information <a href="http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/" target="_blank">from the source</a>!  There&#8217;s no need, in the modern world, to rely on out-of-date media reports.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No.</p>
<p>The Higgs boson is not dangerous and will not destroy the universe.</p>
<p>The Higgs boson is a type of <em>particle</em>, a little ripple in the Higgs <em>field</em>. <em>[See <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">here for the Higgs FAQ</a>.]</em> This lowly particle, if you&#8217;re lucky enough to make one (and at the world&#8217;s largest particle accelerator, the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a>, only one in a trillion proton-proton collisions actually does so) has a brief life, <a title="Most Particles Decay — But Why?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/why-do-particles-decay/most-particles-decay-why/" target="_blank">disintegrating to other particles</a> in less than the time that it takes light to cross from one side of an atom to another. (Recall that light can travel from the Earth to the Moon in under two seconds.) Such a fragile creature is hardly more dangerous than a <a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/189544/mayfly" target="_blank">mayfly</a>.</p>
<p>Anyone who says otherwise probably read Hawking&#8217;s book (or read about it in the press) but didn&#8217;t understand what he or she was reading, perhaps because he or she had not read <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">the Higgs FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to worry about something Higgs-related, you can <em>try</em> to worry about the Higgs field, which is &#8220;ON&#8221; in our universe, though not nearly as &#8220;on&#8221; as it could be. If someone were to turn the Higgs field OFF, let&#8217;s say as a practical joke, that would be a disaster: all ordinary matter across the universe would explode, because the <a title="Electrons: On the Outskirts of Atoms" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/electrons-on-the-outskirts-of-atoms/" target="_blank">electrons on the outskirts of atoms</a> would <a title="Why the Higgs Particle Matters" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/why-the-higgs-particle-matters/" target="_blank">lose their mass and fly off into space</a>. This is not something to worry about, however. We know it would require an input of energy and can&#8217;t happen spontaneously.  Moreover, the amount of energy required to artificially turn the Higgs field off is immense; to do so even in a small room would require energy comparable to that of a typical supernova, an explosion of a star that can outshine an entire galaxy and releases the vast majority of its energy in unseen neutrinos. No one, fortunately, has a supernova in his or her back pocket. And if someone did, we&#8217;d have more immediate problems than worrying about someone wasting a supernova trying to turn off the Higgs field in a basement somewhere.</p>
<p>Now it would also be a disaster if someone could turn the Higgs field WAY UP&#8230; more than when your older brother turned up the volume on your stereo or MP3 player and blew out your speakers. In this case atoms would violently collapse, or worse, and things would be just as nasty as if the Higgs field were turned OFF. Should you worry about this? Well, it&#8217;s possible this could happen spontaneously, so it&#8217;s slightly more plausible. But I do mean slightly. <strong><em>Very</em></strong> slightly.<span id="more-7739"></span></p>
<p>Recently, physicists have been writing about this possibility because if (a) you <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>ASSUME</strong></span> that the types of particles that we&#8217;ve discovered so far are the <em>only</em> ones that affect the Higgs field, and (b) you <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">ASSUME</span></strong> that there are no other important forces that affect the Higgs field other than the ones we know, then you can calculate, with <em>some</em> degree of reliability (though there is a debate about that degree) that (1) the Higgs field could lower the energy of the universe by suddenly jumping from ON to WAY WAY SUPER-DUPER ON, and (2) that the time we&#8217;d have to wait for it to do so spontaneously isn&#8217;t infinite.  It would do this in two steps: first a bubble of WAY WAY ON Higgs field would form <em>(via the curious ability of quantum mechanics to make the improbable happen, rarely)</em>, and then that bubble would expand and sweep across the universe, destroying everything in its path.</p>
<p><em>An aside: In particle physics <a title="Modern Physics: Increasingly Vacuous" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/05/08/modern-physics-increasingly-vacuous/">lingo explained here</a>, we say that &#8220;the universe has two possible &#8216;vacua&#8217;, the vacuum we live in, in which the Higgs field is ON a bit, and a second vacuum in which the Higgs field is HUGELY ON.&#8221; If the second vacuum has lower energy than the first, then the first vacuum is said to be &#8220;metastable&#8221;: although it lasts a very long time, it has a very small but non-zero probability of turning into the second vacuum someday.  That&#8217;s because a bubble of the second vacuum that appears by chance inside the first vacuum will expand, and take over the whole universe.</em></p>
<p>Ok. First, should you buy the original assumptions? No. It&#8217;s just humans assuming that what we currently know is all there is to know; since when has that been true?  Second, even if you do buy them, should you worry about the conclusion? No. The universe has existed in its current form for about 13.7 billion years. The Higgs field may not perform this nasty jump for trillions of years, or trillions of trillions, or trillions of trillions of trillions, or more. Likely more. In any case, nobody knows, but really, nobody should care very much. The calculation is hard, the answer highly uncertain, and worse, the whole thing is profoundly dependent on the <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">ASSUMPTIONS</span></strong>. In fact, if the assumptions are slightly wrong &#8212; if there are other particles and forces that affect the Higgs field, or if there is more than one Higgs-like field in nature &#8212; then the calculation could end up being way off from the truth. Also possible is that the calculational method, which is subtle, isn&#8217;t yet refined enough to give the right answer.  Altogether, this means that not only might the Higgs field&#8217;s nasty jump be much more or less likely than is currently believed, it might not even be possible at all. So we don&#8217;t actually <em>know</em> anything for sure, despite all the loose talk that suggests that we do.  But in any case, since the universe has lived 13.7 billion years already, the chance is <strong><em>ridiculously tiny</em></strong> that this Higgs field jump, even if it is possible at all, will occur in your ultra-short 100 year-ish lifetime, or even that of any of your descendants.</p>
<p>What about the possibility that human beings could <em>artificially</em> cause the Higgs field to turn WAY WAY ON? Again, the amount of energy involved in trying to do that is extremely large &#8212; not a supernova, now, but far, far beyond current human capability, and likely impossible.  (The technology required to build a particle accelerator with collisions at this energy, and the financial and environmental cost of running it, are more than a little difficult to imagine.)  At this point we can barely make Higgs bosons &#8212; little ripples in the Higgs field; now you want to imagine us making a bubble where the Higgs field is WAY WAY WAY MORE ON than usual? We&#8217;re scientists, not magicians. And we deal in science &#8212; i.e., reality.  Current and foreseeable technology cannot turn this imaginary possibility into reality.</p>
<p>Some dangers actually exist in reality. Asteroidlets do sometimes hit the earth; supernovas do explode, and a nearby one would be terrible; and you should not be wandering outdoors or in a shower during a lightning storm.  As for the possible spontaneous destruction of the universe? Well, if it happens some day, it may have nothing to do with the Higgs field; it may very well be due to <em>some other</em> field, about which we currently know <em>nothing</em>, making a jump of a sort that we haven&#8217;t even learned about yet. Humans tend to assume that the things they know about are much scarier than they actually are (e.g. Yellowstone, the &#8220;super&#8221;-volcano) and that the things they don&#8217;t know about are much less scary than they actually are (e.g. what people used to think about ozone-destroying chemicals before they knew they destroyed ozone.) This is worth keeping in mind.</p>
<p>So anyone who tells you that we <em>know</em> that the universe is only &#8220;meta-stable&#8221;, and that someday the Higgs field will destroy it by suddenly screaming at the top of its lungs, or that we might cause it to do so, is forgetting to tell you about all the assumptions that went into that conclusion, and about the incredible energies required which may far exceed what humans can ever manage, and about the incredible lengths of time that may be involved, by which point there may be no more stars left to keep life going anyway, and possibly not even any more protons to make atoms out of. There&#8217;s a word for this kind of wild talk: &#8220;scare-mongering&#8221;.  You can safely go back to sleep.</p>
<p>Or not. There&#8217;s plenty to keep you awake. But by comparison with the spread of the Ebola virus, the increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and acidification of the oceans, or the accelerating loss of the world&#8217;s biodiversity, not to mention the greed and violence common in our species, worrying about Higgs bosons, or even the Higgs field in which a Higgs particle is a tiny ripple, seems to me a tempest in a top quark.</p>
