										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For those of you who live in or around Berkshire County, Massachusetts, or know people who do&#8230;</p>
<p>Starting next week I&#8217;ll be giving two free lectures about the LIGO experiment&#8217;s discovery of gravitational waves.  The lectures will be at 1:30 pm on Mondays June 20 and 27, at Berkshire Community College in Pittsfield, MA.  The first lecture will focus on why gravitational waves were expected by scientists, and the second will be on how gravitational waves were discovered, indirectly and then directly.  No math or science background will be assumed.  (These lectures will be similar in style to the ones I gave a couple of years ago concerning the Higgs boson discovery.)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a flyer with the details:  <a href="http://berkshireolli.org/ProfessorMattStrasslerOLLILecturesFlyer.pdf">http://berkshireolli.org/ProfessorMattStrasslerOLLILecturesFlyer.pdf</a></p>

					<description><![CDATA[In the long and careful process of restarting the Large Hadron Collider [LHC] after its two-year nap for upgrades and repairs, another milestone has been reached: protons have once again collided inside the LHC&#8217;s experimental detectors (named ATLAS, CMS, LHCb and &#8230; <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2015/05/06/lhc-starts-collisions-and-a-radio-interview-tonight/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the long and careful process of restarting the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC] after its two-year nap for upgrades and repairs, another milestone has been reached: <a href="http://home.web.cern.ch/about/updates/2015/05/low-energy-collisions-tune-lhc-experiments">protons have once again collided inside the LHC&#8217;s experimental detectors</a> (named ATLAS, CMS, LHCb and ALICE). This is good news, but don&#8217;t get excited yet. It&#8217;s just one small step. These are collisions at the lowest energy at which the LHC operates (450 GeV per proton, to be compared with the 4000 GeV per proton in 2012 and the 6500 GeV per proton they&#8217;ve already achieved in the last month, though in non-colliding beams.) Also the number of protons in the beams, and the number of collisions per second, is still very, very small compared to what will be needed. So discoveries are not imminent!  Yesterday&#8217;s milestone was just one of the many little tests that are made to assure that the LHC is properly set up and ready for the first full-energy collisions, which should start in about a month.</p>
<p>But since full-energy collisions are on the horizon, why not listen to a radio show about what the LHC will be doing after its restart is complete? Today (Wednesday May 6th), <a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/virtually-speaking-science">Virtually Speaking Science</a>, on which I have appeared a couple of times before, will run a program at 5 pm Pacific time (8 pm Eastern). Science writer Alan Boyle will be interviewing me about the LHC&#8217;s plans for the next few months and the coming years. You can listen live, or listen later once they post it.  <a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/virtually-speaking-science/2015/05/07/alan-boyle-matt-strassler-large-hadron-collider">Here&#8217;s the link for the program.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hope all of you had a good holiday and a good start to the New Year!</p>
<p>I myself continue to be extraordinarily busy as we move into 2015, but I am glad to say that some of that activity involves communicating science to the public.  In fact, <strong>a week from today</strong> I will be giving a public talk &#8212; really a short talk and a longer question/answer period &#8212; in Cambridge, just outside of Boston and not far from MIT. This event is a part of the monthly &#8220;CafeSci&#8221; series, which is affiliated with the famous <a href="http://www.wgbh.org/programs/NOVA-16?MM=1">NOVA science television programs</a> produced for decades by <a href="http://www.wgbh.org/">public TV/Radio station WGBH</a> in Boston.</p>
<p>Note for those of you have gone before to CafeSci events: <strong>it will be in a new venue, not far from Kendall Square</strong>. Here&#8217;s the announcement:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Tuesday, January 20th at 7pm (about 1 hour long)<br />
Le Laboratoire Cambridge (NEW LOCATION)<br />
<a href="http://www.lelaboratoirecambridge.com">http://www.lelaboratoirecambridge.com/ </a><br />
650 East Kendall St, Cambridge, MA</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>“The Large Hadron Collider Restarts Soon! What Lies Ahead?&#8221;</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Speaker: Matthew Strassler</p>
<p><span style="color:#800080;"><em>&#8220;After a long nap, the Large Hadron Collider [LHC], where the Higgs particle was discovered in 2012, will begin operating again in 2015, with more powerful collisions than before. Now that we know Higgs particles exist, what do we want to know about them? What methods can we use to answer our questions? And what is the most important puzzle that we are hoping the LHC will help us solve?&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p>Public Transit: Red line to Kendall Square, walk straight down 3rd Street, turn right onto Athenaeum Street, and left onto East Kendall</p>
<p>Parking: There is a parking deck &#8211; the 650 East Kendall Street Garage &#8211; accessible by Linskey Way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I spent the last two days at <a href="http://www.ias.edu/news/dyson-dreams" target="_blank">an extraordinary conference</a>, &#8220;Dreams of Earth and Sky&#8221;, celebrating the life and career of <a href="http://moreintelligentlife.com/content/ideas/charles-nevin/60-year-job-freeman-dyson" target="_blank">an extraordinary man</a>, one of the many fascinating scientists whom I have had the good fortune to meet. I am referring to Freeman Dyson, professor at the <a href="http://www.ias.edu/" target="_blank">Institute for Advanced Study (IAS)</a>, whose career has spanned so many subfields of science and beyond that the two-day conference simply wasn&#8217;t able to represent them all.</p>
<p><a href="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/dysonphoto.png"><img data-attachment-id="6709" data-permalink="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/29/freeman-dyson-90-still-disturbing-the-universe/dysonphoto/" data-orig-file="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/dysonphoto.png" data-orig-size="201,201" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="DysonPhoto" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/dysonphoto.png?w=201" data-large-file="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/dysonphoto.png?w=201" class="alignright size-full wp-image-6709" alt="DysonPhoto" src="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/dysonphoto.png?w=500" srcset="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/dysonphoto.png 201w, https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/dysonphoto.png?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 201px) 100vw, 201px"   /></a></p>
<p>The event, held on the campus of the IAS, marked Dyson&#8217;s 90th year on the planet and his 60th year as a professor. (In fact his first stay at the IAS was a few years even earlier than that.) The IAS was then still a young institution; Albert Einstein, John Von Neumann, Kurt Gödel and J. Robert Oppenheimer were among the faculty. Dyson&#8217;s most famous work in my own field was on the foundations of the <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and&nbsp;Predictions" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/23/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions/" target="_blank">quantum field theory</a> of the electromagnetic force, &#8220;quantum electrodynamics&#8221;, or &#8220;QED&#8221;. &nbsp;His work helped explain its mathematical underpinnings and clarify how it worked, and so impressed Oppenheimer that he got Dyson a faculty position at the IAS. This work was done at a very young age. &nbsp;By the time I arrived to work at the IAS in 1996, Dyson had officially retired, but was often in his office and involved in lunchtime conversations, mostly with the astronomers and astrophysicists, which is where a lot of his late career work has been centered.</p>
<p>Retirement certainly hasn&#8217;t stopped Dyson&#8217;s activity. His mind seems to be ageless; he is spry, attentive, sharp, and still doing science and writing about it and other topics. When I went up to congratulate him, I was surprised that he not only remembered who I was, he remembered what I had been working on in 1992, when, as an unknown graduate student on the other coast, I had sent him a paper I had written.</p>
<p>By the way, it&#8217;s somewhat bizarre that Dyson never won a Nobel Prize. &nbsp;Arguably it is part of the nature of the awarding process, which typically rewards a specific, deep line of research, and not a polymath whose contributions are spread widely. &nbsp;Just goes to show that you have to look at the content of a person&#8217;s life and work, not the prizes that someone thought fit to award to him or her. &nbsp;Still, he has his share:&nbsp;Dannie Heineman Prize for Mathematical Physics 1965; German Physical Society, Max Planck Medal 1969; Harvey Prize 1977; Wolf Foundation Prize in Physics 1981; American Association of Physics Teachers, Oersted Medal 1991; Enrico Fermi Award 1995; Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion 2000; Henri Poincaré Prize 2012.</p>
<p>The thirteen talks and several brief comments given at the conference, all of which in one way or another related to Dyson&#8217;s work, were organized into sessions on mathematics, on physics and chemistry, on astronomy and astrobiology, and on public affairs. All of the speakers were eminent in their fields, and I encourage you to explore their websites and writings, some of which were controversial, all of which were interesting. For non-scientists, I especially recommend <a href="http://www.hoover.org/fellows/10241" target="_blank">Stanford Professor Emeritus Sid Drell&#8217;s</a> extremely interesting talk about nuclear disarmament (which he&#8217;s been working towards for decades), and a thought-provoking if disconcertingly slick presentation by <a href="http://www.rmi.org" target="_blank">Dr. Amory Lovins of the Rocky Mountain Institute</a>&nbsp;on what he sees as a completely realistic effort, already underway, to wean the United States of its addiction to oil &#8212; with no net cost. Those with a small to moderate amount of scientific background may especially enjoy MIT Professor Sara Seager&#8217;s work on efforts to discover and study planets beyond our own solar system, Texas Professor Bill Press&#8217;s proposal for how to rethink the process of drug trials and approvals in the age of electronic patient records, Sir Martin Rees&#8217;s views on the state of our understanding of the universe, and Caltech&#8217;s Joseph Kirschvink&#8217;s contention that scientific evidence tends to favor the notion that life on this planet most likely started on Mars.</p>
<p>But really, if you haven&#8217;t heard about all the different things Freeman Dyson has done, or read any of his writings, you should not miss the opportunity. Start&nbsp;<a href="http://bigthink.com/users/freemandyson" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Freeman-Dyson/e/B000APXXEU" target="_blank">here</a>, and enjoy!</p>
<p>Many happy returns, Professor Dyson; you have been an inspiration and a role model for several generations of young scientists, and may you have many more happy and healthy years to come!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I got the following questions from a high school English teacher this morning, and I thought, for fun, I&#8217;d put the answers here for you to enjoy. Here (slightly abridged) is what the teacher wrote, and my answers:</p>
<p><em> I&#8217;ve turned my classroom into a video game to increase student engagement. In my gamified classroom, the villain is experimenting with/on the Higgs field. Your article on what would happen if the Higgs field was turned off answered a lot of my questions, but &#8230; I was hoping you could answer a couple of questions for me. I am sure these questions probably don&#8217;t have &#8220;real&#8221; answers, and are completely ridiculous, but I&#8217;d love to hear from you.<span id="more-6505"></span></em></p>
<p><em>1. I&#8217;ve gathered from your site, and others like it, that turning off the Higgs field and making particles mass-less isn&#8217;t possible.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>That&#8217;s correct.  The <a title="Why the Higgs Particle Matters" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/why-the-higgs-particle-matters/">Higgs field</a>&#8216;s non-zero average value is held in place by interactions of the field with itself and with other fields, and it takes an enormous amount of energy to change it. That&#8217;s reflected in the fact that the <a title="Why the Higgs Particle Matters" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/why-the-higgs-particle-matters/" target="_blank">Higgs particle</a> (i.e. Higgs <a title="Fermions and Bosons" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/fermions-and-bosons/" target="_blank">boson</a>) has a large mass compared to the particles that predominantly make up ordinary matter: <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">electrons and up and down quarks</a>.  Even to turn off the Higgs field for an instant <strong>in your classroom alone</strong> would require taking all the energy of a <a title="Supernovas and Neutrinos" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/09/20/supernovas-and-neutrinos/">supernova</a> (the largest type of explosion we regularly observe in the universe, in which a big star blows itself to pieces), and focusing it into that one room.  On top of that, it&#8217;s not enough just to <em>have</em> the energy; you have to find a way to make it <em>do</em> what you want, and that would be extremely difficult to achieve in this case.   But let&#8217;s ignore that complication; we&#8217;ve got plenty of problems already.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>If it were, how might my villain try to do that? What he shoot it the field with protons, or smash two Higgs bosons together? How would one try to turn off a field?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Um, that&#8217;s a tough one. Shooting the field with <a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/" target="_blank">protons</a>, or smashing Higgs particles together, couldn&#8217;t change the Higgs field appreciably any more than shooting bullets into the sea, or smashing big ocean waves together, could boil away the oceans. <span style="color:#888888;">[That&#8217;s not meant as a close analogy, but it gives the rough intuition.]</span></li>
<li>Imagining something even semi-realistic is nigh impossible.  To turn off the Higgs field across the entire earth and its vicinity would force our villain to get all the stars in our galaxy, and all of the galaxies anywhere nearby, to simultaneously explode, and to then direct their energy entirely to the earth.   And then, that&#8217;s just enough to turn the Higgs field off for an instant.  To turn it off and <em>keep</em> it off would require even <strong>more</strong> energy&#8230;  Meanwhile, just the arrival of all that energy beamed at the earth would vaporize the planet even before the Higgs field turned off!</li>
<li>Perhaps your villain has discovered that the universe was built by and is controlled by a supercomputer, itself created by a species of intelligent creatures that lives in a different universe; and your villain has hacked into the computer and has figured out how to use it to turn off the Higgs field without needing to gather any energy at all. Unbelievable as this scenario is, at least it allows you to imagine evading the known laws of physics without apology.  Anything that I can think of that obeys those laws seems just as crazy!</li>
</ul>
<p><em>2. In your article you said a world with no Higgs field would be uninhabitable. If it were, in theory, what would a world with no Higgs field be like? Would people float away? Get turned inside out? Would we all be crushed? I want to paint a picture of what would happen to the world if the villain were successful in turning off the Higgs field while we were on Earth.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Oh no, it&#8217;s much worse than just having an uninhabitable planet.  There&#8217;d be nothing around here except elementary particles.  With the Higgs field turned off, <a title="Why the Higgs Matters, In A Few Sentences" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/03/20/why-the-higgs-matters-in-a-few-sentences/" target="_blank">all atoms in the Higgs field-less region would instantly explode</a>!  The <a title="Atoms: Their Inner Workings" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/atoms-building-blocks-of-molecules/atoms-their-inner-workings/" target="_blank">size of an atom increases as the mass of the electron decreases</a>; turn off the <a title="Electrons: On the Outskirts of Atoms" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/electrons-on-the-outskirts-of-atoms/" target="_blank">electron</a> mass, which would drop to zero if the Higgs field were turned off, and <a title="Atoms: Building Blocks of Molecules" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/atoms-building-blocks-of-molecules/" target="_blank">atoms</a> would just fall apart.  Of course all physical materials are made from atoms &#8212; and <a title="The Molecular Structure of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-molecular-structure-of-matter/" target="_blank">all chemistry and biology is based on atoms</a> &#8212; so there&#8217;d be no earth or people left. Just a very big <strong><span style="color:#993366;">BOOM</span></strong>! How big?  The disintegration of the earth&#8217;s atoms would release roughly enough energy to heat everything in and on the earth instantly to something like 10,000 degrees.  Actually it is probably a lot worse than this.  More subtle effects on the <a title="The Nuclei of Atoms: At the Heart of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-nuclei-of-atoms-at-the-heart-of-matter/" target="_blank">nuclei of atoms</a> would probably result in a temperature close to 1,000,000,000,000 degrees &#8212; quite a bit hotter than the interior of the sun.  So imagine turning the earth into something as hot as the sun, even for a few moments.  There&#8217;s not much point in discussing the details of what happens to human bodies; just like the rocks and the oceans and the air, we&#8217;d all be totally and instantaneously disintegrated into our constituent subatomic particles.  You know what people say about wanting to&#8220;become one with the Earth&#8221; &#8212; well, this is more like &#8220;becoming bazillions with the Earth&#8221;&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<p><em>3. Is there any possibility that the Higgs boson/field, and the future advances in science that comes with it, might one day lead to a new energy source? Similar to a Nuclear plant, could one day we collide two Higgs bosons together for energy?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s very difficult to predict the future; the <a href="http://www.sparkmuseum.com/BOOK_HERTZ.HTM" target="_blank">first person who created radio waves</a> didn&#8217;t see any use for them, and the first people who thought about nuclear fusion (the source of energy in the sun) were confident it would never be considered <a href="http://www.iter.org/" target="_blank">potentially useful on earth</a>. So I&#8217;ll be cautious here. Still, most experts (including me) would guess that the answer is that we won&#8217;t get a new energy source, at least not in any direct way. You can get energy if you have it stored somewhere and you can release it, but (for the reasons just discussed) you have to put energy <em>in</em> to make the Higgs field do something other than just sit there, and there&#8217;s no known or imaginable way to draw energy <em>from</em> it. Certainly we won&#8217;t collide Higgs particle together for energy; it takes lots of energy to make them, they last only a tiny tiny tiny fraction of a second, and whatever energy is released in their collisions or decays will be less than you put in. [This is in contrast to coal or gasoline or atomic nuclei, which are just found lying around, waiting for us to find ways to release their stored energy by burning the coal or gas, or breaking apart the nuclei.] But there could, of course, be indirect impacts. Perhaps what we learn from the Higgs boson will in turn allow us to discover some other source of stored energy&#8230; ahhh, fine, but now we&#8217;re just speculating wildly.</li>
<li>So if you want to speculate wildly, here&#8217;s a way.  Suppose it turns out that dark matter has energy stored in it that it gradually releases, and that what we learn from the studies of the Higgs boson indirectly teaches us where to detect clumps of dark matter in distant orbits around the sun; then you can imagine we might someday put space stations near those clumps that power themselves off of the energy that the dark matter is slowly emitting from its storehouse.  Almost totally unbelievable.  But you&#8217;re making up a game. Go for it.</li>
</ul>
