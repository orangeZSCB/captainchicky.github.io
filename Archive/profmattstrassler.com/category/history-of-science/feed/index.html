										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Last Thursday, <a href="https://muon-g-2.fnal.gov/">an experiment reported</a> that the magnetic properties of the muon, the electron&#8217;s middleweight cousin, are a tiny bit different from what particle physics equations say they should be.  All around the world, the headlines screamed: <strong>PHYSICS IS BROKEN!!!</strong> And indeed, it&#8217;s been pretty shocking to physicists everywhere. For instance, my equations are working erratically; many of the calculations I tried this weekend came out upside-down or backwards.  Even worse, my stove froze my coffee instead of heating it, I just barely prevented my car from floating out of my garage into the trees, and my desk clock broke and spilled time all over the floor.  What a mess!</p>



<p>&#8212;</p>



<p>Broken, eh?  When we say a coffee machine or a computer is broken, it means it doesn&#8217;t work. It&#8217;s unavailable until it&#8217;s fixed.  When a glass is broken, it&#8217;s shattered into pieces.  We need a new one. I know it&#8217;s cute to say that so-and-so&#8217;s video &#8220;broke the internet.&#8221;  But aren&#8217;t we going a little too far now?  Nothing&#8217;s broken about physics; it works just as well today as it did a month ago.</p>



<p>More reasonable headlines have suggested that &#8220;the laws of physics have been broken&#8221;. That&#8217;s better; I know what it means to break a law.  (Though the metaphor is imperfect, since if I were to break a state law, I&#8217;d be punished, whereas if an object were to break a fundamental law of physics, that law would have to be revised!)  But as is true in the legal system, not all physics laws, and not all violations of law, are equally significant.  </p>



<p>What&#8217;s a physics law, anyway? Crudely, physics is a strategy for making predictions about the behavior of physical objects, based on a set of equations <em>and</em> a conceptual framework for using those equations.  Sometimes we refer to the equations as laws; sometimes parts of the conceptual framework are referred to that way.  </p>



<p>But that story has layers.   Physics has an underlying conceptual foundation, which includes the pillar of quantum physics and its view of reality, and the pillar of Einstein&#8217;s relativity and its view of space and time.  (There are other pillars too, such as those of statistical mechanics, but let me not complicate the story now.) That foundation supports many research areas of physics.  Within particle physics itself, these two pillars are combined into a more detailed framework, with concepts and equations that go by the name of &#8220;quantum effective field theory&#8221; (&#8220;QEFT&#8221;).  But QEFT is still very <strong>general</strong>; this framework can describe an enormous number of possible universes, most with completely different particles and forces from the ones we have in our own universe.  We can start making predictions for real-world experiments only when we put the electron, the muon, the photon, and all the other familiar particles and forces into our equations, building up a <strong>specific</strong> example of a QEFT known as &#8220;<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/">The Standard Model of particle physics</a>.&#8221;  </p>



<p>All along the way there are equations and rules that you might call &#8220;laws.&#8221;  They too come in layers.  The Standard Model itself, as a specific QEFT, has few high-level laws: there are no principles telling us why quarks exist, why there is one type of photon rather than two, or why the weak nuclear force is so weak.  The few laws it does have are mostly low-level, true of our universe but not essential to it.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m bringing attention to these layers because an experiment might cause a problem for one layer but not another.   I think you could only fairly suggest that &#8220;physics is broken&#8221; if data were putting a foundational pillar of the entire field into question.  And to say &#8220;the laws of physics have been violated&#8221;, emphasis on the word &#8220;<strong>the</strong>&#8220;, is a bit melodramatic if the only thing that&#8217;s been violated is a low-level, dispensable law.</p>



<p>&#8212;</p>



<p>Has physics, as a whole, <strong>ever</strong> broken?  You could argue that Newton&#8217;s 17th century foundation, which underpinned the next two centuries of physics, broke at the turn of the 20th century.   Just after 1900, Newton-style equations had to be replaced by equations of a substantially different type; the ways physicists used the equations changed, and the concepts, the language, and even the goals of physics changed. For instance, in Newtonian physics, you can predict the outcome of any experiment, at least in principle; in post-Newtonian quantum physics, you often can only predict the probability for one or another outcome, even in principle. And in Newtonian physics we all agree what time it is; in Einsteinian physics, different observers experience time differently and there is no universal clock that we all agree on.  These were immense changes in the foundation of the field.</p>



<p>Conversely, you could also argue that physics didn&#8217;t break; it was just remodeled and expanded.  No one who&#8217;d been studying steam engines or wind erosion or electrical circuit diagrams had to throw out their books and start again from scratch.  In fact this &#8220;broken&#8221; Newtonian physics is still taught in physics classes, and many physicists and engineers never use anything else.  If you&#8217;re studying the physics of weather, or building a bridge, Newtonian physics is just fine. The fact that Newton-style equations are an <strong>incomplete</strong> description of the world &#8212; that there are phenomena they can&#8217;t describe properly &#8212; doesn&#8217;t invalidate them when they&#8217;re applied within their wheelhouse.</p>



<p>No matter which argument you prefer, it&#8217;s hard to see how to justify the phrase &#8220;physics is broken&#8221; without a profound revolution that overthrows foundational concepts.  It&#8217;s rare for a serious threat to foundations to arise suddenly, because few experiments can single-handedly put fundamental principles at risk.  <em>[The infamous case of the &#8220;faster-than-light neutrinos&#8221; provides an exception.  Had that experiment been correct, it would have invalidated Einstein&#8217;s relativity principles. But few of us were surprised when <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/neutrinos-faster-than-light/opera-what-went-wrong/">a glaring error turned up</a>.]</em></p>



<p>&#8212;</p>



<p>In the Standard Model, the electron, muon and tau particles (known as the &#8220;charged leptons&#8221;) are all identical except for their masses. <em>(More fundamentally, they have different interactions with <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/">the Higgs field</a>, from which their rest masses arise.)</em>  This almost-identity is sometimes stated as a &#8220;principle of lepton universality.&#8221;  <strong><em>Oh, wow, a principle &#8212; a law!</em></strong>  But here&#8217;s the thing.  Some principles are enormously important; the principles of Einsteinian relativity determine how cause and effect work in our universe, and you can&#8217;t drop them without running into big paradoxes.  Other principles are weak, and could easily be discarded without making a mess of any other part of physics.  The principle of lepton universality is one of these.   In fact, if you extend the Standard Model by adding new particles to its equations, it can be difficult to <em>avoid</em> ruining this fragile principle.  <em>[In a sense, the Higgs field has already violated the principle, but we don&#8217;t hold that against it.]</em></p>



<p>All the fuss is about a new experimental result which confirms an older one and slightly disagrees with the latest theoretical predictions, which are made using the Standard Model&#8217;s equations.  What could be the cause of the discrepancy?  One possibility is that it arises from a previously unknown difference between muons and electrons &#8212; from a violation of the principle of lepton universality.  For those who live and breathe particle physics, breaking lepton universality would be a big deal; there&#8217;d be lots of adventure in trying to figure out which of the many possible extensions of the Standard Model could actually explain what broke this law. That&#8217;s why the scientists involved sound so excited.  </p>



<p>But the failure of  lepton universality wouldn&#8217;t come as a huge surprise. From certain points of view, the surprise is that the principle has survived this long!  Since this low-level law is easily violated, its demise may not lead us to a profound new understanding of the world. It&#8217;s way too early for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/07/science/particle-physics-muon-fermilab-brookhaven.html">headlines that argue that what&#8217;s at stake is the existence of &#8220;forms of matter and energy vital to the nature and evolution of the cosmos.&#8221;</a> No one can say how much is at stake; it might be a lot, or just a little.</p>



<p>In particular, there&#8217;s absolutely <em>no</em> evidence that <strong><em>physics</em></strong> is broken, or even that <strong><em>particle physics</em></strong> is broken.  The pillars of physics and QEFT are not (yet) threatened.  Even to say that &#8220;<strong><em>the Standard Model </em></strong>might be broken&#8221; seems a bit melodramatic to me.  Does adding a new wing to a house require &#8220;breaking&#8221; the house? Typically you can still live in the place while it&#8217;s being extended. The Standard Model&#8217;s many successes suggest that it might survive largely intact as a recognizable part of a larger, more complete set of equations.</p>



<p>In any case, right now it&#8217;s still too early to say <strong>anything</strong> so loudly.  The apparent discrepancy may not survive the heavy scrutiny it is coming under. There&#8217;s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2021/04/08/why-you-should-doubt-new-physics-from-the-latest-muon-g-2-results/?sh=4443b8616c4b">plenty of controversy</a> about the theoretical prediction for muon magnetism; the required calculation is extraordinarily complex, elaborate and difficult.  </p>



<p>So, from my perspective, the headlines of the past week are way over the top.  The idea that a single measurement of the muon&#8217;s magnetism could &#8220;<a href="https://www.livescience.com/muon-wobble-could-break-physics.html">shake physics to its core</a>&#8220;, as claimed in another headline I happened upon, is amusing at best.   Physics, and its older subdisciplines, have over time become very difficult to break, or even shake.  That&#8217;s the way it should be, when science is working properly.  And that&#8217;s why we can safely base the modern global economy on scientific knowledge; it&#8217;s unlikely that a single surprise could instantly invalidate large chunks of its foundation.</p>



<p>Some readers may view the extreme, click-baiting headlines as harmless.  Maybe I&#8217;m overly concerned about them. But don&#8217;t they implicitly suggest that one day we will suddenly find physics &#8220;upended&#8221;, and in need of a complete top-to-bottom overhaul?  To imply physics can &#8220;break&#8221; so easily makes a mockery of science&#8217;s strengths, and obscures the process by which scientific knowledge is obtained.  And how can it be good to claim &#8220;physics is broken&#8221; and &#8220;the laws of physics have been broken&#8221; over and over and over again, in stories that almost never merit that level of hype and eventually turn out to have been much ado about nada?  The constant manufacturing of scientific crisis cannot possibly be lost on readers, who I suspect are becoming increasingly jaded.   At some point readers may become as skeptical of science journalism, and the science it describes, as they are of advertising; <em>it&#8217;s all lies, so <strong>caveat emptor</strong></em>.   That&#8217;s not where we want our society to be.  As we are seeing in spades during the current pandemic, there can be serious consequences when &#8220;<strong>TRUST IN SCIENCE IS BROKEN!!!</strong>&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8212;</p>



<p><em>A final footnote: Ironically, the Standard Model itself poses one of the biggest threats to the framework of QEFT. The discovery of the Higgs boson <strong>and nothing else (so far)</strong> at the Large Hadron Collider poses a conceptual challenge &#8212; the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/naturalness/">&#8220;naturalness&#8221; problem</a>. There&#8217;s no sharp paradox, which is why I can&#8217;t promise you that the framework of QEFT will someday break if it isn&#8217;t resolved. But the breakdown of lepton universality might someday <strong>help</strong> solve the naturalness problem, by requiring a more &#8220;natural&#8221; extension of the Standard Model, and thus might actually <strong>save</strong> QEFT instead of &#8220;breaking&#8221; it.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A little while back I wrote a <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/02/13/breaking-a-little-new-ground-at-the-large-hadron-collider/">short post</a> about some research that some colleagues and I did using &#8220;open data&#8221; from the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC]. We used data made public by the <a href="https://home.cern/science/experiments/cms">CMS experimental collaboration</a> &#8212; about 1% of their current data &#8212; to search for a new particle, using a couple of twists (as proposed over 10 years ago) on a standard technique.  (CMS is one of the two general-purpose particle detectors at the LHC; the other is called ATLAS.)  We had two motivations: (1) Even if we didn&#8217;t find a new particle, we wanted to prove that our search method was effective; and (2) we wanted to stress-test the CMS Open Data framework, to assure it really does provide all the information needed for a search for something unknown.</p>
<p><a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/02/19/a-broad-search-for-fast-hidden-particles/">Recently I discussed</a> (1), and today I want to address (2): to convey why open data from the LHC is useful but controversial, and why we felt it was important, as theoretical physicists <em>(i.e. people who perform particle physics calculations, but do not build and run the actual experiments)</em>, to do something with it that is usually the purview of experimenters.</p>
<p><strong>The Importance of Archiving Data</strong></p>
<p>In many subfields of physics and astronomy, data from experiments is made public as a matter of routine. Usually this occurs after an substantial delay, to allow the experimenters who collected the data to analyze it first for major discoveries. That&#8217;s as it should be: the experimenters spent years of their lives proposing, building and testing the experiment, and they deserve an uninterrupted opportunity to investigate its data. To force them to release data immediately would create a terrible disincentive for anyone to do all the hard work!</p>
<p>Data from particle physics colliders, however, has not historically been made public. More worrying, it has rarely been archived in a form that is easy for others to use at a later date. I&#8217;m not the right person to tell you the history of this situation, but I can give you a sense for why this still happens today.<span id="more-10236"></span></p>
<p>The fundamental issue is the complexity of data sets from colliders, especially from <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-hadron-as-in-large-hadron-collider/">hadron</a> colliders such as the Tevatron and the LHC. (Archiving was partly done for <a href="https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-electron-positron-collider">LEP</a>, a simpler collider, and was used in later studies including <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1003.0705">this search for unusual Higgs decays</a>  and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06536">this controversial observation,</a> also <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2016/10/21/hiding-from-a-nightmare/">discussed here</a>.) What &#8220;complexity&#8221; are we talking about? Collisions of <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/">protons</a> and/or anti-protons are intrinsically complicated; particles of all sorts go <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/2114779/files/diphoton_v0.png">flying in all directions</a>. The general purpose particle detectors ATLAS and CMS have a complex shape and aren&#8217;t uniform. (Here&#8217;s <a href="https://cms.cern/detector">a cutaway image showing CMS as a set of nested almost-cylinders</a>. Note also that there are inherent weak points: places where cooling tubes have to run, where bundles of wires have to bring signals in and out of the machine, and where segments of the detector join together.) Meanwhile the interactions of the particles with the detector&#8217;s material is messy and often subtle (here&#8217;s <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/2270046/files/Figure_001.png">a significantly oversimplified view</a>). Not every particle is detected, and the probability of missing one depends on where it passes through the detector and what type of particle it is.</p>
<p>Even more important, 99.999% percent of ATLAS and CMS data is discarded as it comes in; only data which passes a set of filters, collectively called <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/the-trigger-discarding-all-but-the-gold/">the &#8220;trigger,&#8221;</a> will even be stored. The trigger is adjusted regularly as experimental conditions change. If you don&#8217;t understand these filters in detail, you can&#8217;t understand the data. Meanwhile the strategies for processing the raw data change over time, becoming more sophisticated, and introducing their own issues that must be known and managed.</p>
<p>I could easily go on (did I mention that at the LHC <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/1479324/files/198609-56-3565522e.png">dozens of collisions occur simultaneously?</a>) If, when you explore the data, you fail to account for all these issues, you can mistake a glitch for a new physical effect, or fail to observe a new physical effect because a glitch obscured it. Any experimentalist inside the collaborations is aware of most of these subtleties, and is surrounded by other experts who will be quick to complain if he or she forgets to account for one of them. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s rare for the experimenters to report a result that has this type of error embedded in it.</p>
<p>Now,<strong><em> imagine writing a handbook that would encapsulate all of that combined knowledge, for use by people who will someday analyze the data without having access to that collective human library.</em></strong> This handbook would accompany an enormous data set taken in changing conditions, and would need to contain everything a person could possibly need to know in order to properly analyze data from an LHC experiment without making a technical error.</p>
<p><strong>Not easy!</strong> But this is what the <a href="http://opendata.cern.ch/">Open Data project at CERN</a>, in which CMS is one of the participating experiments, aims to do. Because it&#8217;s extremely difficult, and therefore expensive in personnel and time, its value has to be clear.</p>
<p>I personally do think the value <strong><em>is</em></strong> clear, especially at the LHC. Until the last couple of decades, one could argue that data from an old particle physics experiment would go out of date so quickly, superseded by better experiments, that it really wasn&#8217;t needed. But this argument has broken down as experiments have become more expensive, with new ones less frequent. There is no guarantee, for instance, that any machine superseding the LHC will be built during my lifetime; it is a minimum of 20 and perhaps 40 years away. In all that time, the LHC&#8217;s data will be the state of the art in proton-proton collider physics, so it ought to be stored so that experts can use it 25 years from now. The price for making that possible has to be paid.</p>
<p><em>[This price was not paid for the Tevatron, whose data, which will remain the gold standard for <strong>proton-antiproton</strong> collisions for perhaps a century or more, is not well-archived.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Was Using Open Data Necessary For Our Project?</strong></p>
<p>Even if we all agree that it&#8217;s important to archive LHC data so that it can be used by future experimental physicists, it&#8217;s not obvious that <strong><em>today&#8217;s theorists</em> </strong>should use it. There&#8217;s an alternative: a theorist with a particular idea can temporarily join one of the experimental collaborations, and carry out the research with like-minded experimental colleagues. In principle, this is a much better way to do things; it permits access to the full data set, it allows the expert experimentalists to handle and manage the data instead of amateurs like us, and it should in principle lead to state-of-the-art results.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t found this approach to work. I&#8217;ve been recommending the use of our technique <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/02/19/a-broad-search-for-fast-hidden-particles/"><em>[selecting events where the transverse momentum of the muon and antimuon pair is large, and often dropping isolation requirements]</em></a> for over ten years, along with several related techniques. These remarks appear in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0712.2041">papers</a>; I&#8217;ve mentioned these issues in <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/94815/contributions/1282671/">many talks</a>, discussed them in detail with at least two dozen experimentalists at ATLAS and CMS (including many colleagues at Harvard), and even started a preliminary project with an experimenter to study them. But everyone had a reason not to proceed. I was told, over and over again, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, we&#8217;ll get to this next year.&#8221; After a decade of this, I came to feel that perhaps it would be best if we carried out the analysis ourselves.</p>
<p>Even then, there was an alternative: we could have just done a study of our method using simulated data, and this would have proved the value of our technique. Why spend the huge amount of time and effort to do a detailed analysis, on a fraction of the real data?</p>
<p>First, I worried that a study on simulated data would be no more effective than all of the talks I gave and all the personal encouraging I did over the previous ten years. I think seeing the study done for real has a lot more impact, because it shows explicitly how effective the technique is and how easily it is implemented. <em>[Gosh, if even theorists can do it&#8230;]</em></p>
<p>Second, one of the things we did in our study is include &#8220;non-isolated muons&#8221; &#8212; muons that have other particles close by &#8212; which are normally not included in theorists&#8217; studies. Dropping the usual isolation criteria may be essential for discoveries of hidden particles, as Kathryn Zurek and I have emphasized since 2006 (and studied in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0712.2041">a paper with Han and Si, in 2007</a>). I felt it was important to show this explicitly in our study. But we needed the real data to do this; simulation of the background sources for non-isolated muons would not have been accurate. <em>[The experimenters rarely use non-isolated muons in the type of analysis we carried out, but notably <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01890">have been doing so here</a>; my impression is that they were unaware of our work from 2007 and came to this approach independently.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Stress Testing the Archive</strong></p>
<p>A further benefit to using the real data was that we stress-tested the archiving procedure in the Open Data project, and to do this fully, we had to carry out our analysis to the very end. The success or failure of our analysis was a test of whether the CMS Open Data framework truly provides all the information needed to do a complete search for something unknown.</p>
<p>The test received a passing grade, with qualifications. Not only we did complete the project, we were able to repeat a rather precise measurement of the (well-known) cross-section for Z boson production, which would have failed if the archive and the accompanying information had been unusable. That said, there is room for improvement: small things were missing, including some calibration information and some simulated data. The biggest issue is perhaps the format for the data storage (difficult to use and unpack for a typical user).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to recognize that the persons in charge of Open Data at CMS have a huge and difficult job; they have to figure out how to write the nearly impossible handbook I referred to above. It&#8217;s therefore crucial that people like our group of theorists actually use the open data sets <em><strong>now</strong></em>, not just after the LHC is over. <em><strong>Now</strong></em>, when the open data sets are still small, is the time to figure out what information is missing, to determine how to improve the data storage, to fill out the documentation and make sure it has no gaps. We hope we&#8217;ve contributed something to that process.</p>
<p><strong>The Future</strong></p>
<p>Should others follow in our footsteps? Yes, I think, though not lightly. In our case, five experts required two years to do the simplest possible study; we could have done it in one year if we&#8217;d been more efficient, but probably not much less. Do not underestimate what this takes, both in terms of understanding the data and learning how to do statistical analysis that most people rarely undertake.</p>
<p>But there are studies that simply cannot be done without real data, and unless you can convince an experimentalist to work with you, your only choice may be to dive in and do your best. And if you are already somewhat informed, but want to learn more about how real experimental analysis is done, so you can appreciate more fully what is typically hidden from view, you will not find a better self-training ground. If you want to take it on, I suggest, as an initial test, that you try to replicate our measurement of the Z boson cross-section. If you can&#8217;t, you&#8217;re not ready for anything else.</p>
<p>I should emphasize that Open Data is a resource that can be used in other ways, and several groups have already done this. In addition to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05842">detailed studies</a> of <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/jets-the-manifestation-of-quarks-and-gluons/">jets</a> carried out on the <em><strong>real</strong></em> data by my collaborators, led by Professor Jesse Thaler, there have been <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11916">studies</a> that have relied solely on the archive of <em><strong>simulated</strong></em> data also provided by the CMS Open Data project. These have value too, in that they offer proving grounds for techniques to be applied later to real data. Since exploratory studies of simulated data don&#8217;t require the extreme care that analysis of real data demands, there may be a lot of potential in this aspect of the Open Data project.</p>
<p>In the end, our research study, like most analyses, is just a drop in the huge bucket of information learned from the LHC. Its details should not obscure the larger question: <em><strong>how shall we, as a community, maintain the LHC data set so that it can continue to provide information across the decades?</strong></em> Maybe the Open Data project is the best approach.  If so, how can we best support it?  And if not, what is the alternative?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back in 1999 I saw a total solar eclipse in Europe, and it was a life-altering experience.  I wrote about it back then, but was never entirely happy with the article.  This week I&#8217;ve revised it.  It could still benefit from some editing and revision (comments welcome), but I think it&#8217;s now a good read.  It&#8217;s full of intellectual observations, but there are powerful emotions too.</p>

<p><strong> A Luminescent Darkness: My 1999 Eclipse Adventure</strong></p>
<p>© Matt Strassler 1999</p>
<p>After two years of dreaming, two months of planning, and two hours of packing, I drove to John F. Kennedy airport, took the shuttle to the Air France terminal, and checked in.  I was brimming with excitement. In three days time, with a bit of luck, I would witness one the great spectacles that a human being can experience: a complete, utter and total eclipse of the Sun.<span id="more-9609"></span></p>
<p>I had missed one eight years earlier. In July 1991, a total solar eclipse crossed over Baja California. I had thought seriously about driving the fourteen hundred miles from the San Francisco area, where I was a graduate student studying theoretical physics, to the very southern tip of the peninsula. But worried about my car&#8217;s ill health and scared by rumors of gasoline shortages in Baja, I chickened out. Four of my older colleagues, more worldly and more experienced, and supplied with a more reliable vehicle, drove down together. When they returned, exhilarated, they regaled us with stories of their magical adventure. Hearing their tales, I kicked myself for not going, and had been kicking myself ever since. Life is not so long that such opportunities can be rationalized or procrastinated away.</p>
<p>A total eclipse of the Sun is a event of mythic significance, so rare and extraordinary and unbelievable that it really ought to exist only in ancient legends, in epic poems, and in science fiction stories. There are other types of eclipses &#8212; partial and total eclipses of the Moon, in which the Earth blocks sunlight that normally illuminates the Moon, and various eclipses of the Sun in which the Moon blocks sunlight that normally illuminates the Earth. But total solar eclipses are in a class all their own. Only during the brief moments of totality does the Sun vanish altogether, leaving the shocked spectator in a suddenly darkened world, gazing uncomprehendingly at a black disk of nothingness.</p>
<p>Our species relies on daylight. Day is warm; day grows our food; day permits travel with a clear sense of what lies ahead. We are so fearful of the night &#8212; of what lurks there unseen, of the sounds that we cannot interpret. Horror films rely on this fear; demons and axe murderers are rarely found walking about in bright sunshine. Dark places are dangerous places; sudden unexpected darkness is worst of all. These are the conventions of cinema, born of our inmost psychology. But the Sun and the Moon are not actors projected on a screen. The terror is real.</p>
<p>It has been said that if the Earth were a member of a federation of a million planets, it would be a famous tourist attraction, because this home of ours would be the only one in the republic with such beautiful eclipses. For our skies are witness to a coincidence truly of cosmic proportions. It is a stunning accident that although the Sun is so immense that it could hold a million Earths, and the Moon so small that dozens could fit inside our planet, these two spheres, the brightest bodies in Earth&#8217;s skies, appear the same size. A faraway giant may seem no larger than a nearby child. And this perfect match of their sizes and distances makes our planet&#8217;s eclipses truly spectacular, visually and scientifically. They are described by witnesses as a sight of weird and unique beauty, a visual treasure completely unlike anything else a person will ever see, or even imagine.</p>
<p>But total solar eclipses are uncommon, occurring only once every year or two. Even worse, totality only occurs in a narrow band that sweeps across the Earth &#8212; often just across its oceans. Only a small fraction of the Earth sees a total eclipse in any century. And so these eclipses are precious; only the lucky, or the devoted, will experience one before they die.</p>
<p>In my own life, I&#8217;d certainly been more devoted than lucky. I knew it wasn&#8217;t wise to wait for the Moon&#8217;s shadow to find me by chance. Instead I was going on a journey to place myself in its path.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge in eclipse-chasing is the logistics. The area in which totality is visible is very long but very narrow. For my trip, in 1999, it was a long strip running west to east all across Europe, but only a hundred miles wide from north to south. A narrow zone crossing heavily populated areas is sure to attract a massive crowd, so finding hotels and transport can be difficult. Furthermore, although eclipses are precisely predictable, governed by the laws of gravity worked out by Isaac Newton himself, weather and human beings are far less dependable.</p>
<p>But I had a well-considered plan. I would travel by train to a small city east of Paris, where I had reserved a rental car. Keeping a close watch on the weather forecast, I would drive on back roads, avoiding clogged highways. I had no hotel reservations. It would have been pointless to make them for the night before the event, since it was well known that everything within two hours drive of the totality zone was booked solid. Moreover, I wanted the flexibility to adjust to the weather and couldn&#8217;t know in advance where I&#8217;d want to stay. So my idea was that on the night prior to the eclipse, I would drive to a good location in the path of the lunar shadow, and sleep in the back of my car. I had a sleeping bag with me to keep me warm, and enough lightweight clothing for the week &#8212; and not much else.</p>
<p>Oh, it was such a good plan, clean and simple, and that&#8217;s why my heart had so far to sink and my brain so ludicrous a calamity to contemplate when I checked my wallet, an hour before flight time, and saw a gaping black emptiness where my driver&#8217;s license was supposed to be. I was struck dumb. No license meant no car rental; no car meant no flexibility and no place to sleep. Sixteen years of driving and I had never lost it before; why, why, of all times, now, when it was to play a central role in a once-in-a-lifetime adventure?</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t panic. I walked calmly back to the check-in counters, managed to get myself rescheduled for a flight on the following day, drove the three hours back to New Jersey, and started looking. It wasn&#8217;t in my car. Nor was it in the pile of unneeded items I&#8217;d removed from my wallet. Not in my suitcase, not under my bed, not in my office. As it was Sunday, I couldn&#8217;t get a replacement license. Hope dimmed, flickered, and went dark.</p>
<p>Deep breaths. Plan B?</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t have a tent, and couldn&#8217;t easily have found one. But I did have a rain poncho, large enough to keep my sleeping bag off the ground. As long as it didn&#8217;t rain too hard, I could try, the night before the eclipse, to find a place to camp outdoors; with luck I&#8217;d find lodging for the other nights. I doubted this would be legal, but I was willing to take the chance. But what about my suitcase? I couldn&#8217;t carry that around with me into the wilderness. Fortunately, I knew a solution. For a year after college, I had studied music in France, and had often gone sightseeing by rail. On those trips I had commonly made use of the ubiquitous lockers at the train stations, leaving some luggage while I explored the nearby town. As for flexibility of location, that was unrecoverable; the big downside of Plan B was that I could no longer adjust to the weather. I&#8217;d just have to be lucky. I comforted myself with the thought that the worst that could happen to me would be a week of eating French food.</p>
<p>So the next day, carrying the additional weight of a poncho and an umbrella, but having in compensation discarded all inessential clothing and tourist information, I headed back to the airport, this time by bus. Without further misadventures, I was soon being carried across the Atlantic.</p>
<p>As usual I struggled to nap amid the loud silence of a night flight. But my sleeplessness was rewarded with one of those good omens that makes you think that you must be doing the right thing. As we approached the European coastline, and I gazed sleepily out my window, I suddenly saw a bright glowing light. It was the rising white tip of the thin crescent Moon.</p>
<p>Solar eclipses occur at New Moon, always. This is nothing but simple geometry; the Moon must place itself exactly between the Sun and the Earth to cause an eclipse, and that means the half of the Moon that faces us must be in shadow. (At Full Moon, the opposite is true; the Earth is between the Sun and the Moon, so the half of the Moon that faces us is in full sunlight. That&#8217;s when lunar eclipses can occur.) And just before a New Moon, the Moon is close to the Sun&#8217;s location in the sky. It becomes visible, as the Earth turns, just before the Sun does, rising as a morning crescent shortly before sunrise. (Similarly, we get an evening crescent just after a New Moon.)</p>
<p>There, out over the vast Atlantic, from a dark ocean of water into a dark sea of stars, rose the delicate thin slip of Luna the lover, on her way to her mystical rendezvous with Sol. Her crescent smiled at me and winked a greeting. I smiled back, and whispered, &#8220;see you in two days&#8230;&#8221; For totality is not merely the only time you can look straight at the Sun and see its crown. It is the only time you can see the New Moon.</p>
<p>We landed in Paris at 6:30 Monday morning, E-day-minus-two. I headed straight to the airport train station, and poured over rail maps and my road maps trying to guess a good location to use as a base. Eventually I chose a medium-sized town with the name Charleville-Mezieres. It was on the northern edge of the totality zone, at the end of a large spoke of the Paris-centered rail system, and was far enough from Paris, Brussels, and all large German towns that I suspected it might escape the worst of the crowds. It would then be easy, the night before the eclipse, to take a train back into the center of the zone, where totality would last the longest.</p>
<p>Two hours later I was in the Paris-East rail station and had purchased my ticket for Charleville-Mezieres. With ninety minutes to wait, I wandered around the station. It was evident that France had gone eclipse-happy. Every magazine had a cover story; every newspaper had a special insert; signs concerning the event were everywhere. Many of the magazines carried free eclipse glasses, with a black opaque metallic material for lenses that only the Sun can penetrate. Warnings against looking at the Sun without them were to be found on every newspaper front page. I soon learned that there had been a dreadful scandal in which a widely distributed shipment of imported glasses was discovered to be dangerously defective, leading the government to make a hurried and desperate attempt to recall them. There were also many leaflets advertising planned events in towns lying in the totality zone, and information about extra trains that would be running. A chaotic rush out of Paris was clearly expected.</p>
<p>Before noon I was on a train heading through the Paris suburbs into the farmlands of the Champagne region. The rocking of the train put me right to sleep, but the shrieking children halfway up the rail car quickly ended my nap. I watched the lovely sunlit French countryside as it rolled by. The Sun was by now well overhead &#8212; or rather, the Earth had rotated so that France was nearly facing the Sun head on. Sometimes, when the train banked on a turn, the light nearly blinded me, and I had to close my eyes.</p>
<p>With my eyelids shut, I thought about how I&#8217;d managed, over decades, to avoid ever once accidentally staring at the Sun for even a second&#8230; and about how almost every animal with eyes manages to do this during its entire life. It&#8217;s quite a feat, when you think about it. But it&#8217;s essential, of course. The Sun&#8217;s ferocious blaze is even worse than it appears, for it contains more than just visible light. It also radiates light too violet for us to see &#8212; ultraviolet &#8212; which is powerful enough to destroy our vision. Any animal lacking instincts powerful enough to keep its eyes off the Sun will go blind, soon to starve or be eaten. But humans are in danger during solar eclipses, because our intense curiosity can make us ignore our instincts. Many of us will suffer permanent eye damage, not understanding when and how it is safe to look at the Sun&#8230; which is almost, but not quite, never.</p>
<p>In fact the only time it is safe to look with the naked eye is during totality, when the Sun&#8217;s disk is completely blocked by the New Moon, and the world is dark. Then, and only then, can one see that the Sun is not a sphere, and that it has a sort of atmosphere, immense and usually unseen.</p>
<p>At the heart of the Sun, and source of its awesome power, is its nuclear furnace, nearly thirty million degrees hot and nearly five billion years old. All that heat gradually filters and boils out of the Sun&#8217;s core toward its visible surface, which is a mere six thousand degrees&#8230; still white-hot. Outside this region is a large irregular halo of material that is normally too dim to see against the blinding disk. The inner part of that halo is called the chromosphere; there, giant eruptions called &#8220;prominences&#8221; loop outward into space. The outer part of the halo is the &#8220;corona&#8221;, Latin for &#8220;crown.&#8221; The opportunity to see the Sun&#8217;s corona is one of the main reasons to seek totality.</p>
<p>Still very drowsy, but in a good mood, I arrived in Charleville. Wanting to leave my bags in the station while I looked for a hotel room, I searched for the luggage lockers. After three tiring trips around the station, I asked at a ticket booth. &#8220;Oh,&#8221; said the woman behind the desk, &#8220;we haven&#8217;t had them available since the Algerian terrorism of a few years ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>I gulped. This threatened plan B, for what was I to do with my luggage on eclipse day? I certainly couldn&#8217;t walk out into the French countryside looking for a place to camp while carrying a full suitcase and a sleeping bag! And even the present problem of looking for a hotel would be daunting. The woman behind the desk was sympathetic, but her only suggestion was to try one of the hotels near the station. Since the tourist information office was a mile away, it seemed the only good option, and I lugged my bags across the street.</p>
<p>Here, finally, luck smiled. The very first place I stopped at had a room for that night, reasonably priced and perfectly clean, if spartan. It was also available the night after the eclipse. My choice of Charleville had been wise. Unfortunately, even here, Eclipse Eve &#8212; Tuesday evening &#8212; was as bad as I imagined. The hoteliere assured me that all of Charleville was booked (and my later attempts to find a room, even a last-minute cancellation, proved fruitless.) Still, she she was happy for me to leave my luggage at the hotel while I tramped through the French countryside. Thus was Plan B saved.</p>
<p>Somewhat relieved, I wandered around the town. Charleville is not unattractive, and the orange sandstone 16th century architecture of its central square is very pleasing to the eye. By dusk I was exhausted and collapsed on my bed. I slept long and deep, and awoke refreshed. I took a short sightseeing trip by train, ate a delicious lunch, and tried one more time to find a room in Charleville for Eclipse Eve. Failing once again, I resolved to camp in the heart of the totality zone.</p>
<p>But where? I had several criteria in mind. For the eclipse, I wanted to be far from any large town or highway, so that streetlights, often automatically triggered by darkness, would not spoil the experience. Also I wanted hills and farmland; I wanted to be at a summit, with no trees nearby, in order to have the best possible view. It didn&#8217;t take long to decide on a location. About five miles south of the unassuming town of Rethel, rebuilt after total destruction in the first world war, my map showed a high hill. It seemed perfect.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I learned just in time that this same high hill had attracted the attention of the local authorities, and they had decided to designate this very place the &#8220;official viewing site&#8221; in the region. A hundred thousand people were expected to descend on Rethel and take shuttles from the town to the &#8220;site.&#8221; Clearly this was not where I wanted to be!</p>
<p>So instead, when I arrived in Rethel, I walked in another direction. I aimed for an area a few miles west of town, quiet hilly farmland.</p>
<p>Yet again, my luck seemed to be on the wane. By four it was drizzling, and by five it was raining. Darkness would settle at around eight, and I had little time to find a site for unobtrusive camping, much less a dry one. The rain stopped, restarted, hesitated, spat, but refused to go away. An unending mass of rain clouds could be seen heading toward me from the west. I had hoped to use trees for some shelter against rain, but now the trees were drenched and dripping, even worse than the rain itself.</p>
<p>Still completely unsure what I would do, I continued walking into the evening. I must have cut a very odd figure, carrying an open umbrella, a sleeping bag, and a small black backpack. I took a break in a village square, taking shelter at a church&#8217;s side door, where I munched on French bread and cheese. Maybe one of these farmers would let me sleep in a dry spot in his barn, I thought to myself. But I still hadn&#8217;t reached the hills I was aiming for, so I kept walking.</p>
<p>After another mile, I came to a hilltop with a dirt farm track crossing the road. There, just off the road to the right, was a large piece of farm machinery. And underneath it, a large, flat, sheltered spot. Hideous, but I could sleep there. Since it wasn&#8217;t quite nightfall yet and I could see a hill on the other side of the road along the same track, one which looked like it might be good for watching the eclipse, I took a few minutes to explore it. There I found another piece of farm equipment, also with a sheltered underbelly. This one was much further from the road, looked unused, and presumably offered both safer and quieter shelter. It was sitting just off the dirt track in a fallow field. The field was of thick, sticky, almost hard mud, the kind you don&#8217;t slip in and which doesn&#8217;t ooze but which gloms onto the sides of your shoe.</p>
<p>And so it was that Eclipse Eve found me spreading my poncho in a friendly unknown farmer&#8217;s field, twisting my body so as not to hit my head on the metal bars of my shelter, carefully unwrapping my sleeping bag and removing my shoes so as not to cover everything in mud, brushing my teeth in bottled water, and bedding down for the night. The whole scene was so absurd that I found myself sporting a slightly manic grin and giggling. But still, I was satisfied. Despite the odds, I was in the zone at the appointed time; when I awoke the next morning I would be scarcely two miles from my final destination. If the clouds were against me, so be it. I had done my part.</p>
<p>I slept pretty well, considering both my excitement and the uneven ground. At daybreak I was surrounded by fog, but by 8 a.m.~the fog was lifting, revealing a few spots of blue sky amid low clouds. My choice of shelter was also confirmed; my sleeping bag was dry, and across the road the other piece of machinery I had considered was already in use.</p>
<p>I packed up and started walking west again. The weather seemed uncertain, with three layers of clouds &#8212; low stratus, medium cumulus, and high cirrus &#8212; crossing over each other. Blue patches would appear, then close up. I trudged to the base of my chosen hill, then followed another dirt track to the top, where I was graced with a lovely view. The rolling <em>paysage</em> of fertile France stretched before me, blotched here and there with sunshine.  Again I had chosen well, better than I realized, as it turned out, for I was not alone on the hill. A Belgian couple had chosen it too &#8212; and they had a car&#8230;</p>
<p>There I waited. The minutes ticked by. The temperature fluctuated, and the fields changed color, as the Sun played hide and seek. I didn&#8217;t need these reminders of the Sun&#8217;s importance &#8212; that without its heat the Earth would freeze, and without its light, plants would not grow and the cycle of life would quickly end. I thought about how pre-scientific cultures had viewed the Sun. In cultures and religions around the world, the blazing disk has often been attributed divine power and regal authority. And why not? In the past century, we&#8217;ve finally learned what the Sun is made from and why it shines. But we are no less in awe than our ancestors, for the Sun is much larger, much older, and much more powerful than most of them imagined.</p>
<p>For a while, I listened to the radio. Crowds were assembling across Europe. Special events &#8212; concerts, art shows, contests &#8212; were taking place, organized by towns in the zone to coincide with the eclipse. This was hardly surprising. All those tourists had come for totality. But totality is brief, never more than a handful of minutes.  It&#8217;s the luck of geometry, the details of the orbits of the Earth and Moon, that set its duration. For my eclipse, the Moon&#8217;s shadow was only about a hundred miles wide. Racing along at three thousand miles per hour, it would darken any one location for at most two minutes. Now if a million people are expected to descend on your town for a two-minute event, I suppose it is a good idea to give them something else to do while they wait. And of course, the French cultural establishment loves this kind of opportunity. Multimedia events are their specialty, and they often give commissions to contemporary artists. I was particularly amused to discover later that an old acquaintance of mine &#8212; I met him in 1987 at the composers&#8217; entrance exams for the Paris Conservatory &#8212; had been commissioned to write an orchestral piece, called &#8220;Eclipse,&#8221; for the festival in the large city of Reims. It was performed just before the moment of darkness.</p>
<p>Finally, around 11:30, the eclipse began. The Moon nibbled a tiny notch out of the sun. I looked at it briefly through my eclipse glasses, and felt the first butterflies of anticipation. The Belgian couple, in their late fourties, came up to the top of the hill and stood alongside me. They were Flemish, but the man spoke French, and we chatted for a while. It turned out he was a scientist also, and had spent some time in the United States, so we had plenty to talk about. But our discussion kept turning to the clouds, which showed no signs of dissipating. The Sun was often veiled by thin cirrus or completely hidden by thick cumulus. We kept a nervous watch.</p>
<p>Time crawled as the Moon inched across the brilliant disk. It passed the midway point and the Sun became a crescent. With only twenty minutes before totality, my Belgian friends conversed in Dutch. The man turned to me. &#8220;We have decided to drive toward that hole in the clouds back to the east,&#8221; he said in French. &#8220;It&#8217;s really not looking so good here. Do you want to come with us?&#8221; I paused to think. How far away was that hole? Would we end up back at the town? Would we get caught in traffic? Would we end up somewhere low? What were my chances if I stayed where I was? I hesitated, unsure. If I went with them, I was subject to their whims, not my own. But after looking at the oncoming clouds one more time, I decided my present location was not favorable. I joined them.</p>
<p>We descended the dirt track and turned left onto the road I&#8217;d taken so long to walk. It was completely empty. We kept one eye on where we were going and five eyes on the sky. After two miles, the crescent sun became visible through a large gap in the low clouds. There were still high thin clouds slightly veiling it, but the sky around it was a pale blue. We went a bit further, and then stopped&#8230; at the very same dirt track where I had slept the night before. A line of ten or fifteen cars now stretched along it, but there was plenty of room for our vehicle.</p>
<p>By now, with ten minutes to go, the light was beginning to change. When only five percent of the Sun remains, your eye can really tell. The blues become deeper, the whites become milkier, and everything is more subdued. Also it becomes noticeably cooler. I&#8217;d seen this light before, in New Mexico in 1994. I had gone there to watch an &#8220;annular&#8221; eclipse of the Sun. An annular eclipse occurs when the Moon passes directly in front of the Sun but is just a bit too far away from the Earth for its shadow to reach the ground. In such an eclipse, the Moon fails to completely block the Sun; a narrow ringlet, or &#8220;annulus&#8221;, often called the &#8220;ring of fire,&#8221; remains visible. That day I watched from a mountain top, site of several telescopes, in nearly clear skies. But imagine the dismay of the spectators as the four-and-a-half minutes of annularity were blocked by a five-minute cloud! Fortunately there was a bright spot. For a brief instant &#8212; no more than three seconds &#8212; the cloud became thin, and a perfect circle of light shone through, too dim to penetrate eclipse glasses but visible with the naked eye&#8230; a veiled, surreal vision.</p>
<p>On the dirt track in the middle of French fields, we started counting down the minutes. There was more and more tension in the air. I put faster speed film into my camera. The light became still milkier, and as the crescent became a fingernail, all eyes were focused either on the Sun itself or on a small but thick and dangerous-looking cloud heading straight for it. Except mine. I didn&#8217;t care if I saw the last dot of sunlight disappear. What I wanted to watch was the coming of Moon-shadow.</p>
<p>One of my motivations for seeking a hill was that I wanted to observe the approach of darkness. Three thousand miles an hour is just under a mile per second, so if one had a view extending out five miles or so, I thought, one could really see the edge coming. I expected it would be much like watching the shadow of a cloud coming toward me, with the darkness sweeping along the ground, only much darker and faster. I looked to the west and waited for the drama to unfold.</p>
<p>And it did, but it was not what I was expecting. Even though observing the shadow is a common thing for eclipse watchers to do, nothing I had ever read about eclipses prepared me in the slightest for what I was about to witness. I&#8217;ve never seen it photographed, or even described. Maybe it was an effect of all the clouds around us. Or maybe others, just as I do, find it difficult to convey.</p>
<p>For how can one relate the sight of daylight sliding swiftly, like an sigh, to deep twilight? of the western sky, seen through scattered clouds, changing seamlessly and inexorably from blue to pink to slate gray to the last yellow of sunset? of colors rising up out of the horizon and spreading across the sky like water from a broken dyke flooding onto a field?</p>
<p>I cannot find the right combination of words to capture the sense of being swept up, of being overwhelmed, of being transfixed with awe, as one might be before the summoning of a great wave or a great wind by the command of a god, yet all in utter silence and great beauty. Reliving it as I write this brings a tear. In the end I have nothing to compare it to.</p>
<p>The great metamorphosis passed. The light stabilized. Shaken, I looked up.</p>
<p>And quickly looked away. I had seen a near-disk of darkness, the fuzzy whiteness of the corona, and some bright dots around the disk&#8217;s edge, one especially bright where the Sun still clearly shone through. Accidentally I had seen with my naked eyes the &#8220;diamond ring,&#8221; a moment when the last brilliant drop of Sun and the glistening corona are simultaneously visible. It&#8217;s not safe to look at. I glanced again. Still several bright dots. I glanced again. Still there &#8212; but the Sun had to be covered by now&#8230;</p>
<p>So I looked longer, and realized that the Sun was indeed covered, that those bright dots were there to stay. There it was. The eclipsed Sun, or rather, the dark disk of the New Moon, surrounded by the Sun&#8217;s crown, studded at its edge with seven bright pink jewels. It was bizarre, awe-inspiring, a spooky hallucination. It shimmered.</p>
<p>The Sun&#8217;s corona didn&#8217;t really resemble what I had seen in photographs, and I could immediately see why. The corona looked as though it were made of glistening white wispy hair, billowing outward like a mop of whiskers. It gleamed with a celestial light, a shine resembling that of well-lit tinsel. No camera could capture that glow, no photograph reproduce it.</p>
<p>But the greatest, most delightful surprise was the seven beautiful gems. I knew they had to be the great eruptions on the surface of the Sun, prominences, huge magnetic storms larger than our planet and more violent than anything else in the solar system. However, nobody ever told me they were bright pink! I always assumed they were orange (silly of me, since the whole Sun looks orange if you look at it through an orange filter, which the photographs always do.) They were arranged almost symmetrically around the sun, with one of them actually well separated from its surface and halfway out into the lovely soft filaments of the corona. I explored them with my binoculars. The colors, the glistening timbre, the rich detail, it is a visual delight. The scene is living, vibrant, delicate and soft; by comparison, all the photographs and films seem dry, flat, deadened.</p>
<p>I was surprised at my calm. After the great rush of the shadow, the stasis of totality had caught me off guard.  Around me it was much lighter than I had expected. The sense was of late twilight, with a deep blue-purple sky; yet it was still bright enough to read by. The yellow light of late sunset stretched all the way around the horizon. The planet Venus was visible, but no stars peeked through the clouds. Perhaps longer eclipses have darker skies, a larger Moon-shadow putting daylight further away.</p>
<p>I had scarcely had time to absorb all of this when, just at the halfway point of totality, the dangerous-looking cumulus cloud finally arrived, and blotted out the view. A groan, but only a half-hearted one, emerged from the spectators; after all we&#8217;d seen what we&#8217;d come to see. I took in the colors emanating from the different parts of the sky, and then looked west again, waiting for the light to return. A thin red glow touched the horizon. I waited. Suddenly the red began to grow furiously. I yelled &#8220;Il revient!&#8221; &#8212; it is returning! &#8212; and then watched in awe as the reds became pinks, swarmed over us, turned yellow-white&#8230;</p>
<p>And then&#8230; it was daylight again. Normality, or a slightly muted version of it. The magical show was over, heavenly love had been consummated, we who had traveled far had been rewarded. The weather had been kind to us. There was a pause as we savored the experience, and waited for our brains to resume functioning. Then congratulations were passed around as people shook hands and hugged each other. I thanked my Belgian friends, who like me were smiling broadly. They offered me a ride back to town. I almost accepted, but stopped short, and instead thanked them again and told them I somehow wanted to be outside for a while longer. We exchanged addresses, said goodbyes, they drove off.</p>
<p>I started retracing my steps from the previous evening. As I walked back to the town of Rethel in the returning sunshine, the immensity of what I had seen began gradually to make its way through my skin into my blood, making me teary-eyed. I thought about myself, a scientist, educated and knowledgeable about the events that had just taken place, and tried to imagine what would have happened to me today if I had not had<br />
that knowledge and had found myself, unexpectedly, in the Moon&#8217;s shadow.</p>
<p>It was not difficult; I had only to imagine what I would feel if the sky suddenly, without any warning, turned a fiery red instead of blue and began to howl. It would have been a living nightmare. The terror that I would have felt would have penetrated my bones. I would have fallen on my knees in panic; I would have screamed and wept; I would have called on every deity I knew and others I didn&#8217;t know for help; I would have despaired; I would have thought death or hell had come; I would have assumed my life was about to end. The two minutes of darkness, filled with the screams and cries of my neighbors, would have been timeless, maddening. When the Sun just as suddenly returned, I would have collapsed onto the ground with relief, profusely and weepingly thanking all of the deities for restoring the world to its former condition, and would have rushed home to relatives and friends, hoping to find some comfort and solace.</p>
<p>I would have sought explanations. I would have been willing to consider anything: dragons eating the Sun, spirits seeking to punish our village or country for its transgressions, evil and spiteful monsters trying to freeze the Earth, gods warning us of terrible things to come in future. But above all, <em>I could never, never have imagined that </em><em>this brief spine-chilling extinction and transformation of the Sun was a natural </em><em>phenomenon.</em> Nothing so spectacular and sudden and horrifying could have been the work of mere matter. It would once and for all have convinced me of the existence of creatures greater and more powerful than human beings, if I had previously had any doubt.</p>
<p>And I would have been forever changed. No longer could I have entirely trusted the regularity of days and nights, of seasons, of years. For the rest of my life I would have always found myself glancing at the sky, wanting to make sure that all, for the moment, was well. For if the Sun could suddenly vanish for two minutes, perhaps the next time it could vanish for two hours, or two days&#8230; or two centuries. Or forever.</p>
<p>I pondered the impact that eclipses, both solar and lunar, have had throughout human history. They have shaped civilizations. Wars and slaughters were begun and ended on their appearance; they sent ordinary people to their deaths as appeasement sacrifices; new gods and legends were invoked to give meaning to them. The need to predict them, and the coincidences which made their prediction possible, helped give birth to astronomy as a mathematically precise science, in China, in Greece, in modern Europe &#8212; developments without which my profession, and even my entire technologically-based culture, might not exist.</p>
<p>It was an hour&#8217;s walk to Rethel, but that afternoon it was a long journey. It took me across the globe to nations ancient and distant. By the time I reached the town, I&#8217;d communed with my ancestors, reconsidered human history, and examined anew my tiny place in the universe.  If I&#8217;d been a bit calm during totality itself, I wasn&#8217;t anymore. What I&#8217;d seen was gradually filtering, with great potency, into my soul.</p>
<p>I took the train back to Charleville, and slept dreamlessly. The next two days were an opportunity to unwind, to explore, and to eat well. On my last evening I returned to Paris to visit my old haunts. I managed to sneak into the courtyard of the apartment house where I had had a one-room garret up five flights of stairs, with its spartan furnishings and its one window that looked over the roofs of Paris to the Eiffel Tower. I wandered past the old Music Conservatory, since moved to the northeast corner of town, and past the bookstore where I bought so much music. My favorite bakery was still open.</p>
<p>That night I slept in an airport hotel, and the next day flew happily home to the American continent. I never did find my driver&#8217;s license.</p>
<p>But psychological closure came already on the day following the eclipse. I spent that day in Laon, a small city perched magnificently atop a rocky hill that rises vertically out of the French plains. I wandered its streets and visited its sights &#8212; an attractive church, old houses, pleasant old alleyways, ancient walls and gates. As evening approached I began walking about, looking for a restaurant, and I came to the northwestern edge of town overlooking the new city and the countryside beyond. The clouds had parted, and the Sun, looking large and dull red, was low in the sky. I leaned on the city wall and watched as the turning Earth carried me, and Laon, and all of France, at hundreds of miles an hour, intent on placing itself between me and the Sun. Yet another type of solar eclipse, one we call &#8220;sunset.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ruddy disk touched the horizon. I remembered the wispy white mane and the brilliant pink jewels. In my mind the Sun had always been grand and powerful, life-giver and taker, essential and dangerous. It could blind, burn, and kill.  I respected it, was impressed and awed by it, gave thanks for it, swore at it, feared it. But in the strange light of totality, I had seen beyond its unforgiving, blazing sphere, and glimpsed a softer side of the Sun. With its feathery hair blowing in a dark sky, it had seemed delicate, even vulnerable. It is, I thought to myself, as mortal as we.</p>
<p>The distant French hills rose across its face. As it waned, I found myself feeling a warmth, even a tenderness &#8212; affection for this giant glowing ball of hydrogen, this protector of our planet, this lonely beacon in a vast emptiness&#8230; the only star you and I will ever know.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Results for <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2015/12/18/so-what-is-it/">the bump seen in December</a> have been updated, and indeed, with the new 2016 data &#8212; four times as much as was obtained in 2015 &#8212; neither ATLAS nor CMS [the two general purpose detectors at the Large Hadron Collider] sees an excess where the bump appeared in 2015. Not even a hint, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2016/08/04/a-flash-in-the-pan-flickers-out/">as we already learned inadvertently from CMS yesterday</a>.</p>
<p>All indications so far are that the bump was a garden-variety statistical fluke, probably <em>(my personal guess! there&#8217;s no evidence!)</em> enhanced slightly by minor imperfections in the 2015 measurements. Should we be surprised? No. If you look back at the history of the 1970s and 1980s, or at the recent past, you&#8217;ll see that it&#8217;s quite common for hints &#8212; even strong hints &#8212; of new phenomena to disappear with more data. This is especially true for hints based on small amounts of data (and there were not many two photon events in the bump &#8212; just a couple of dozen).  There&#8217;s a reason why particle physicists have very high standards for statistical significance before they believe they&#8217;ve seen something real.  <em>(Many other fields, notably medical research, have much lower standards.  Think about that for a while.)</em>  History has useful lessons, if you&#8217;re willing to learn them.</p>
<p>Back in December 2011, a lot of physicists were persuaded that the data shown by ATLAS and CMS was convincing evidence that the Higgs particle had been discovered. It turned out the data was indeed showing the first hint of the Higgs. But their confidence in what the data was telling them at the time &#8212; what was called &#8220;firm evidence&#8221; by some &#8212; was dead wrong. I took a lot of flack for <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/holiday-higgs-hints-confidence-inspiring-or-not/">viewing that evidence</a> as a 50-50 proposition (70-30 <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/05/04/search-workshop-panel-discussion-on-lhc-posted-online/">by March 2012</a>, after more evidence was presented). Yet the December 2015 (<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2016/03/18/the-diphoton-excess-improves-a-bit/">March 2016</a>) evidence for the bump at 750 GeV was comparable to what we had in December 2011 for the Higgs. Where&#8217;d it go?  Clearly such a level of evidence is not so firm as people claimed. I, at least, would not have been surprised if that original Higgs hint had vanished, just as I am not surprised now&#8230; though disappointed of course.</p>
<p>Was this all much ado about nothing? I don&#8217;t think so. There&#8217;s a reason to have fire drills, to run live-fire exercises, to test out emergency management procedures. A lot of new ideas, both in terms of new theories of nature and new approaches to making experimental measurements, were generated by thinking about this bump in the night. The hope for a quick 2016 discovery may be gone, but what we learned will stick around, and make us better at what we do.</p>

<p>Guralnik, with Tom Kibble and Carl Hagen, wrote one of <a title="The Twists and Turns of Hi(gg)story" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/08/the-twists-and-turns-of-higgstory/" target="_blank">the four 1964 papers</a> which represent the birth of the idea of the <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">&#8220;Higgs&#8221; field</a>, now understood as the source of mass for <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the known elementary particles</a> &#8212; an idea that was confirmed by <a title="Discovery of the Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-discovery-of-the-higgs/" target="_blank">the discovery of a type of &#8220;Higgs&#8221; particle in 2012</a> at the Large Hadron Collider.  <em>(I find it sad that the obituary is sullied with a headline that contains the words &#8220;God Particle&#8221; &#8212; a term that no physicist involved in the relevant research ever used, and which was invented in the 1990s, not as science or even as religion, but for $$$&#8230; by someone who was trying <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-God-Particle-Universe-Question/dp/0618711686" target="_blank">to sell his book</a>.)</em> The other three papers &#8212; the first by Robert Brout and Francois Englert, and the second and third by Peter Higgs, were rewarded with <a title="The Twists and Turns of Hi(gg)story" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/08/the-twists-and-turns-of-higgstory/" target="_blank">a Nobel Prize in 2013</a>; it was <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2013/" target="_blank">given just to Englert and Higgs</a>, Brout having died too early, in 2011.  Though Guralnik, Hagen and Kibble won many other prizes, they were not awarded a Nobel for their work, a decision that will remain forever controversial.</p>
<p>But at least Guralnik lived long enough to learn, as Brout sadly did not, that his ideas were realized in nature, and to see <a title="Higgs Discovery: The Data" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-discovery-of-the-higgs/higgs-discovery-the-data/" target="_blank">the consequences of these ideas in real data</a>. In the end, that&#8217;s the real prize, and one that no human can award.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In <a title="A 100 TeV Proton-Proton Collider?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/03/a-100-tev-proton-proton-collider/">my last post</a>, I expressed the view that a particle accelerator with <a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/" target="_blank">proton</a>-proton collisions of (roughly) 100 <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/" target="_blank">TeV</a> of energy, significantly more powerful than the currently operational <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC] that helped scientists <a title="Discovery of the Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-discovery-of-the-higgs/" target="_blank">discover</a> the <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">Higgs particle</a>, is an obvious and important next steps in our process of learning about the elementary workings of nature. And I described how we don&#8217;t yet know whether it will be an exploratory machine or a machine with a clear scientific target; it will depend on what the LHC does or does not discover over the coming few years.</p>
<p>What will it mean, for the 100 TeV collider project and more generally, if the LHC, having made possible the discovery of the Higgs particle, provides us with no more clues?  Specifically, over the next few years, hundreds of tests of the Standard Model (the equations that govern <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the known particles and forces</a>) will be carried out in measurements made by the ATLAS, CMS and LHCb experiments at the LHC. Suppose that, as it has so far, the Standard Model passes every test that the experiments carry out? In particular, suppose the Higgs particle discovered in 2012 appears, after a few more years of intensive study, to be, as far the LHC can reveal, a <a title="The Standard Model Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/" target="_blank">Standard Model Higgs</a> &#8212; the simplest possible type of Higgs particle?</p>
<p>Before we go any further, let&#8217;s keep in mind that we already know that the Standard Model isn&#8217;t all there is to nature. The Standard Model does not provide a consistent theory of gravity, nor does it explain <a title="Neutrinos" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/" target="_blank">neutrino</a> masses, <a title="Questions and Answers About Dark Matter post-LUX" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/31/questions-and-answers-about-dark-matter-post-lux/" target="_blank">dark matter</a> or &#8220;dark energy&#8221; (also known as <a title="Why You Can’t Easily Dismiss the Cosmological Constant Problem" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/08/30/why-you-cant-easily-dismiss-the-cosmological-constant-problem/" target="_blank">the cosmological constant</a>). Moreover, many of its features are just things we have to accept without explanation, such as the strengths of the forces, the existence of &#8220;three generations&#8221; (i.e., that <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">there are two heavier cousins of the electron, two for the up quark and two for the down quark</a>), the values of the masses of the various particles, etc. However, even though the Standard Model has its limitations, it is possible that everything that can actually be measured at the LHC &#8212; which cannot measure neutrino masses or directly observe dark matter or dark energy &#8212; will be well-described by the Standard Model. What if this is the case?</p>
<p><strong>Michelson and Morley, and What They Discovered</strong></p>
<p>In science, giving strong evidence that something <strong>isn&#8217;t</strong> there can be as important as discovering something that <strong>is</strong> there &#8212; and it&#8217;s often harder to do, because you have to thoroughly exclude all possibilities. <em>[It&#8217;s very hard to show that your lost keys are <strong>nowhere</strong> in the house &#8212; you have to convince yourself that you looked <strong>everywhere</strong>.]</em> A famous example is the case of <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1907/michelson-bio.html" target="_blank">Albert Michelson</a>, in his two experiments (one in 1881, a second with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Morley" target="_blank">Edward Morley</a> in 1887) trying to detect the &#8220;ether wind&#8221;.</p>
<p>Light had been shown to be a wave in the 1800s; and like all waves known at the time, it was assumed to be a wave <strong>in</strong> something material, just as sound waves are waves <strong>in</strong> air, and ocean waves are waves <strong>in</strong> water. This material was termed the &#8220;luminiferous ether&#8221;. As we can detect our motion through air or through water in various ways, it seemed that it should be possible to detect our motion through the ether, specifically by looking for the possibility that light traveling in different directions travels at slightly different speeds.  This is what Michelson and Morley were trying to do: detect the movement of the Earth through the luminiferous ether.</p>
<p>Both of Michelson&#8217;s measurements failed to detect any ether wind, and did so expertly and convincingly. And for the convincing method that he invented &#8212; an experimental device called an interferometer, which had many other uses too &#8212; <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1907/press.html" target="_blank">Michelson won the Nobel Prize in 1907</a>. Meanwhile the failure to detect the ether drove both <a href="http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/987/1/Michelson.pdf" target="_blank">FitzGerald and Lorentz to consider radical new ideas about how matter might be deformed</a> as it moves through the ether. Although these ideas weren&#8217;t right, they were important steps that Einstein was able to re-purpose, even more radically, in his 1905 equations of special relativity.</p>
<p>In Michelson&#8217;s case, <strong><em>the failure to discover the ether was itself a discovery</em></strong>, recognized only in retrospect: a discovery that the ether did not exist. <em>(Or, if you&#8217;d like to say that it <strong>does</strong> exist, which some people do, then what was discovered is that the ether is utterly unlike any normal material substance in which waves are observed; no matter how fast or in what direction you are moving relative to me, <strong>both of us are at rest</strong> relative to the ether.)</em> So one must not be too quick to assume that a lack of discovery is actually a step backwards; it may actually be a huge step forward.</p>
<p><strong>Epicycles or a Revolution?</strong></p>
<p>There were various attempts to make sense of Michelson and Morley&#8217;s experiment.   Some interpretations involved  tweaks of the notion of the ether.  Tweaks of this type, in which some original idea (here, the ether) is retained, but adjusted somehow to explain the data, are often referred to as &#8220;epicycles&#8221; by scientists.   <em>(This is analogous to the way <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferent_and_epicycle" target="_blank">an epicycle was used by Ptolemy to explain the complex motions of the planets in the sky</a>, in order to retain an earth-centered universe; the sun-centered solar system requires no such epicycles.)</em> A tweak of this sort <strong><em>could</em></strong> have been the right direction to explain Michelson and Morley&#8217;s data, but as it turned out, it was not. Instead, the non-detection of the ether wind required something more dramatic &#8212; for it turned out that waves of light, though at first glance very similar to other types of waves, were in fact extraordinarily different. <em><strong>There simply was no ether wind for Michelson and Morley to detect</strong></em>.</p>
<p>If the LHC discovers nothing beyond the Standard Model, we will face what I see as a similar mystery.  <a title="Naturalness and the Standard Model" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/naturalness/" target="_blank">As I explained here</a>, the Standard Model, with no other particles added to it, is a consistent but extraordinarily <em>&#8220;unnatural&#8221;</em> (i.e. extremely non-generic) example of <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part 2)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/24/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-2/" target="_blank">a quantum field theory</a>.  This is a big deal. Just as nineteenth-century physicists deeply understood both the <em>theory</em> of waves and many specific <em>examples of waves in nature </em> and had excellent reasons to expect a detectable ether, twenty-first century physicists understand quantum field theory and naturalness both from the theoretical point of view <strong>and</strong> from many examples in nature, and have very good reasons to expect particle physics to be described by a natural theory.  (Our examples come both from condensed matter physics [e.g. metals, magnets, fluids, etc.] and from particle physics [e.g. the physics of <a title="What’s a Hadron?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-hadron-as-in-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">hadrons</a>].) Extremely <strong><em>unnatural</em></strong> systems &#8212; that is, physical systems described by quantum field theories that are <strong><em>highly non-generic</em></strong> &#8212; simply have not previously turned up in nature&#8230; which is just as we would expect from our theoretical understanding.</p>
<p><em>[Experts: As I emphasized in <a href="http://online.kitp.ucsb.edu/online/joefest_c14/" target="_blank">my Santa Barbara talk last week</a>, appealing to anthropic arguments about the hierarchy between gravity and the other forces does <strong>not</strong> allow you to escape from the naturalness problem.]</em></p>
<p>So what might it mean if an unnatural quantum field theory describes all of the measurements at the LHC? It may mean that our understanding of particle physics requires an epicyclic change &#8212; a <em>tweak</em>.  The implications of a tweak would potentially be minor. A tweak might only require us to keep doing what we&#8217;re doing, exploring in the same direction but a little further, working a little harder &#8212; i.e. to keep colliding protons together, but go up in collision energy a bit more, from the LHC to the 100 TeV collider. For instance, perhaps the Standard Model is supplemented by additional particles that, rather than having masses that put them within reach of the LHC, as would inevitably be the case in a <em><strong>natural</strong></em> extension of the Standard Model (here&#8217;s <a title="Supersymmetry — What Is It?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/supersymmetry-what-is-it/" target="_blank">an example</a>), are just <em>a little bit</em> heavier than expected. In this case the world would be <em>somewhat</em> unnatural, but not too much, perhaps through some relatively minor accident of nature; and a 100 TeV collider would have enough energy per collision to discover and reveal the nature of these particles.</p>
<p>Or perhaps a tweak is entirely the wrong idea, and instead our understanding is fundamentally amiss. Perhaps another Einstein will be needed to radically reshape the way we think about what we know.  A<span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;"> dramatic rethink is both more exciting and more disturbing. It was an intellectual challenge for 19th century physicists to imagine, from the result of the Michelson-Morley experiment, that key clues to its explanation would be found in seeking violations of Newton&#8217;s equations for <a title="How Did Einstein Do It?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/mass-and-energy/how-did-einstein-do-it/" target="_blank">how energy and momentum depend on velocity</a>. (The first experiments on this issue were carried out in 1901, but definitive experiments took another 15 years.) It was an even greater challenge to envision that the <a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Le_Verrier.html" target="_blank">already-known unexplained shift in the orbit of Mercury</a> would also be related to the Michelson-Morley (non)-discovery, as Einstein, in trying to adjust Newton&#8217;s gravity to make it consistent with the theory of special relativity, showed in 1913. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">My point is that the experiments that were needed to properly interpret Michelson-Morley&#8217;s result</span></p>
<ul>
<li>did not involve trying to detect motion through the ether,</li>
<li>did not involve building even more powerful and accurate interferometers,</li>
<li>and were not immediately obvious to the practitioners in 1888.</li>
</ul>
<p>This should give us pause. We might, if we continue as we are, be heading in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>Difficult as it is to do, we have to take seriously the possibility that <strong>if</strong> (and remember this is still <em><strong>a very big &#8220;if&#8221;</strong></em>) the LHC finds only what is predicted by the Standard Model, the reason may involve a significant reorganization of our knowledge, perhaps even as great as relativity&#8217;s re-making of our concepts of space and time. Were that the case, it is possible that higher-energy colliders would tell us nothing, and give us no clues at all. An exploratory 100 TeV collider is not guaranteed to reveal secrets of nature, any more than a better version of Michelson-Morley&#8217;s interferometer would have been guaranteed to do so. It may be that a completely different direction of exploration, including directions that currently would seem silly or pointless, will be necessary.</p>
<p>This is not to say that a 100 TeV collider isn&#8217;t needed!  It <em>might</em> be that all we need is a tweak of our current understanding, and then such a machine <em>is</em> exactly what we need, and will be the only way to resolve the current mysteries.  Or it might be that the 100 TeV machine is just what we need to learn something revolutionary.  But we also need to be looking for other lines of investigation, perhaps ones that today would sound unrelated to particle physics, or even unrelated to any known fundamental question about nature.</p>
<p>Let me provide one example from recent history &#8212; one which did not lead to a discovery, but still illustrates that this is not all about 19th century history.</p>
<p><strong>An Example</strong></p>
<p>One of the great contributions to science of Nima Arkani-Hamed, Savas Dimopoulos and Gia Dvali was to observe <em>(in <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9803315" target="_blank">a 1998 paper</a> I&#8217;ll refer to as ADD, after the authors&#8217; initials)</em> that no one had ever excluded the possibility that we, and all the particles from which we&#8217;re made, can move around freely in three spatial dimensions, but are stuck (as it were) as though to the corner edge of a thin rod &#8212; a rod as much as one millimeter wide, into which only gravitational fields (but not, for example, electric fields or magnetic fields) may penetrate.  Moreover, they emphasized that the presence of these extra dimensions might explain why gravity is so much weaker than the other known forces.</p>

<p>Given the incredible number of experiments over the past two centuries that have probed distances vastly smaller than a millimeter, the claim that there could exist millimeter-sized unknown dimensions was amazing, and came as a tremendous shock &#8212; certainly to me. At first, I simply didn&#8217;t believe that the ADD paper could be right.  But it was.</p>
<p>One of the most important immediate effects of the ADD paper was to generate a strong motivation for a new class of experiments that could be done, rather inexpensively, on the top of a table. If the world were as they imagined it might be, then Newton&#8217;s (and Einstein&#8217;s) law for gravity, which states that the force between two stationary objects depends on the distance r between them as 1/r², would increase faster than this at distances shorter than the width of the rod in Figure 1.  This is illustrated in Figure 2.</p>

<p>These experiments are not easy &#8212; gravity is very, very weak compared to electrical forces, and lots of electrical effects can show up at very short distances and have to be cleverly avoided. But some of the best experimentalists in the world figured out how to do it (see <a href="http://www.npl.washington.edu/eotwash/sr" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~aharonk/gravity.html" target="_blank">here</a>). After the experiments were done, Newton/Einstein&#8217;s law was verified down to a few hundredths of a millimeter.  If we live on the corner of a rod, as in Figure 1, it&#8217;s much, much smaller than a millimeter in width.</p>
<p>But it <strong><em>could</em></strong> have been true. And if it had, it might not have been discovered by a huge particle accelerator. It might have been discovered in these small inexpensive experiments <em>that could have been performed years earlier</em>. The experiments weren&#8217;t carried out earlier<span style="color:#333333;"> mainly because no one had pointed out quite how important they could be.</span></p>
<p><strong>Ok Fine; What Other Experiments Should We Do?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">So what are the non-obvious experiments we should be doing now or in the near future?  Well, if I had a really good suggestion for a new class of experiments, I would tell you &#8212; or rather, I would write about it in a scientific paper. (Actually, I <em>do</em> know of <a title="Unexpected Decays of the Higgs Particle: What We Found" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/02/11/non-standard-model-higgs-particle-decays-what-we-found/">an important class of measurements</a>, and I <em>have</em> written <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4992" target="_blank">a scientific paper</a> about them; but these are measurements to be done at the LHC, and don&#8217;t involve a entirely new experiment.)  Although I&#8217;m thinking about these things, I do not yet have any good ideas.  Until I do, or someone else does, this is all just <strong><em>talk</em></strong> &#8212; and talk does not impress physicists. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">Indeed, you might object that my remarks in this post have been almost without content, and possibly without merit.  I agree with that objection.</span></p>
<p>Still, I have some reasons for making these points. In part, I want to highlight, for a wide audience, the possible historic importance of what might now be happening in particle physics. And I especially want to draw the attention of young people. There have been experts in my field who have written that non-discoveries at the LHC constitute a &#8220;nightmare scenario&#8221; for particle physics&#8230; that there might be nothing for particle physicists to do for a long time. But I want to point out that on the contrary, not only may it not be a nightmare, it might actually represent an extraordinary opportunity. Not discovering the ether opened people&#8217;s minds, and eventually opened the door for Einstein to walk through. And if the LHC shows us that particle physics is not described by a natural quantum field theory, it may, similarly, open the door for a young person to show us that our understanding of quantum field theory and naturalness, while as intelligent and sensible and precise as the 19th century understanding of waves, does not apply unaltered to particle physics, and must be significantly revised.</p>
<p>Of course the LHC is still a young machine, and it may still permit additional major discoveries, rendering everything I&#8217;ve said here moot. But young people entering the field, or soon to enter it, should not assume that the experts necessarily understand where the field&#8217;s future lies. Like FitzGerald and Lorentz, even the most brilliant and creative among us might be suffering from our own hard-won and well-established assumptions, and we might soon need the vision of a brilliant young genius &#8212; perhaps a theorist with a clever set of equations, or perhaps an experimentalist with a clever new question and a clever measurement to answer it &#8212; to set us straight, and put us onto the right path.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While the eastern half of the United States is having a cold winter so far, the same has not been true in Italy. The days I spent <a title="Teaching at a “Winter School”" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/01/15/teaching-at-a-winter-school/">teaching in Florence</a> (Firenze), at the <a href="http://ggi-www.fi.infn.it/index.php?p=home.inc" target="_blank">Galileo Galilei Institute</a> (GGI), were somewhat warmer than is apparently the usual, with even low temperatures far above freezing <a title="Moon and Jupiter Galileo-Style, ***This Evening***" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/01/15/moon-and-jupiter-galileo-style-this-evening/" target="_blank">almost every night</a>. A couple of people there said to me that they &#8220;hadn&#8217;t seen any winter yet&#8221;. So I was amused to read, on U.S. news websites, yet more reports of Americans uselessly debating the climate change issue &#8212; as though either the recent cold in the eastern U.S. or the recent warmth in Europe can tell us anything relevant to that discussion. (<a title="Polar Vortex, Climate Change, Red Herring?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/01/13/polar-vortex-climate-change-red-herring/" target="_blank">Here&#8217;s why it can&#8217;t.</a>) It does seem to be widely forgotten in the United States that our country occupies only about 2% percent of the area of the Earth.</p>
<p>Of course the warmer Italian weather made my visit more pleasant, especially since the GGI is 20 minutes up a long hill &#8212; the Arcetri hill, of particular significance in scientific history. <em>[I am grateful to the GGI, and the scientist- organizers <a href="http://webtheory.sns.it/ggilectures/" target="_blank">of the school at which I taught</a>, especially <a href="http://inspirehep.net/search?ln=en&amp;p=a+de+curtis%2C+s&amp;of=hb&amp;action_search=Search" target="_blank">Stefania de Curtis</a>, for making my visit to Arcetri and its sites possible.]</em> The University of Florence used to be located there, and there are a number of astronomical observatories on the hill. And for particle physics, there is significance too. The building where I was teaching, and that hosts the GGI, used to be the department of Physics and Astronomy of the university. There, in 1925, Enrico Fermi, one of the greatest physicists of the 20th century, had his first professorial position. And while serving in that position, he figured out the statistical and thermodynamic properties of a gas made from particles that, in his honor, we now call &#8220;fermions&#8221;.  [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/9912229v1.pdf" target="_blank">His paper was recently translated into English</a> by A. Zannoni.]</p>
<p>All particles in our world &#8212; elementary particles such as electrons and photons, and more complex objects such as atoms &#8212; are either <a title="Fermions and Bosons" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/fermions-and-bosons/" target="_blank">fermions or bosons</a>; the classic example of a fermion is an <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/electrons-on-the-outskirts-of-atoms/" target="_blank">electron</a>. The essential property of fermions is that <em>two identical fermions cannot do precisely the same thing at the same time</em>. For electrons in atoms, this is known as the <strong><em>Pauli exclusion principle</em></strong> (due to Wolfgang Pauli in 1925, based on 1924 research by <a href="http://www.stoner.leeds.ac.uk/about/stoner" target="_blank">Edmund Stoner</a>): <em>no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state</em>. All of atomic physics and chemistry, and the very stability of large chunks of matter made from atoms, are dependent upon this principle. The properties of fermions also are crucial to the stability and structure of <a title="The Nuclei of Atoms: At the Heart of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-nuclei-of-atoms-at-the-heart-of-matter/" target="_blank">atomic nuclei</a>, the existence of neutron stars, the electrical properties of metals and insulators, and the properties of many materials at cold temperatures.</p>

[Credit: M. Strassler]</p></div>Inside the building is a plaque commemorating Fermi&#8217;s great achievement. But Fermi did not remain long in Florence, or even in Italy. A mere 15 years later, in the midst of the Fascist crisis and war in Europe, and having won a Nobel Prize for his work on radioactive atoms, Fermi had taken a position in the United States. There he directly oversaw the design, building and operation of humanity&#8217;s first nuclear reactor, in a secret underground laboratory at the University of Chicago, paving the way for the nuclear age.</p>
<p>But the main reason the Arcetri hill is famous for science is, ironically, because of a place of religion.</p>
<p>Both of Galileo&#8217;s daughters had taken the veil, and in 1631 the aging scientist was prompted to rent a villa on a small farm, within sight and a short walk of their nunnery.  Unfortunately, what must have seemed like an idyllic place to grow old and do science soon turned into a nightmare. After years of coexistence with and even support from within the Catholic Church, he had pushed too hard; his publication in 1632 of a comparison of the old Ptolemaic view of the universe, with the Earth at the center, with the newer Copernican view (to which he had greatly contributed, through his astronomical discoveries, in the 1610s), engendered a powerful backlash from some who viewed it as heretical. He was forced to spend 1633 defending himself in Rome and then living in exile in Sienna. When he was allowed to return to Arcetri in 1634, he was under house arrest and not allowed to have any scientific visitors. Shortly after his return, his 33-year-old daughter, with whom he was very close, died of a sudden and severe illness. His vision failed him, due to unknown diseases, and he was blind by 1638. Unable to go to Florence, his home town, scarcely three miles away, and rarely able to meet visitors, he spent the rest of his time in Arcetri isolated and increasingly ill, finally dying there in 1642.</p>
<p>Yet despite this, or perhaps because of it, Galileo&#8217;s science did not come to a halt. (This was also partly because of the his support from the Grand Duke of Tuscany, who interceded on his behalf to allow him some scientific assistance after he went blind.) At Arcetri, Galileo discovered the moon did not always present exactly the same face toward the Earth; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lunar_libration_with_phase_Oct_2007_450px.gif" target="_blank">it appears, to us on Earth, to wobble slightly</a>. The explanation for this so-called &#8220;lunar libration&#8221; awaited Issac Newton&#8217;s laws of motion and of gravity, just 50 years away. And he finished formulating laws of motion (which would also later be explained by Newton), showing that (on Earth) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUqpyia45PM" target="_blank">objects tossed into the air follow a trajectory that mathematicians call a parabola</a>, until affected by what we now call &#8220;air resistance&#8221;, and showing that uniform motion cannot be detected &#8212; <a title="The First Principle of Relativity" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/the-first-principle-of-relativity/" target="_blank">the first Principle of Relativity</a>, authored 270 years before Einstein presented his revision of Galileo&#8217;s ideas.</p>

(No, the light fixture is not original.) [Credit: M. Strassler]</p></div>To step into Galileo&#8217;s villa, as I did a few days ago, is therefore to step into a place of intense personal tragedy and one of great scientific achievement. One can easily imagine him writing by the window, or walking in the garden, or discussing the laws of motion with his assistants, in such a setting. It is also to be reminded that Galileo was not a poor man, thanks to his inventions and to his scientific appointments. The ceilings of the main rooms on the lower floor of the villa are high and vaulted, with attractively carved supports. There is a substantial &#8220;loggia&#8221; on the upper floor &#8212; a balcony, with pillars supporting a wooden roof, that (facing south-east, south and west) would have been ideal, while Galileo could still see, for observing the Moon and planets.</p>
<p>While Galileo&#8217;s luck ran badly in his later years, he had an extraordinary string of luck, as a younger scientist, at the beginning of the 1600s. First, in 1604, there was a supernova, as bright as the planet Jupiter, that appeared in the sky as a very bright new star. (Humans haven&#8217;t seen a correspondingly close and bright supernova since then, not even supernova 1987a.  <a title="A Not-So-Far-Away Type Ia Supernova" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/01/24/a-not-so-far-away-type-ia-supernova/" target="_blank">There is one you can see with a small telescope right now though.</a>) Observing that the glowing object showed no signs of parallax (<a title="Parallax: Seeing in Depth" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/parallax-seeing-in-depth/">see here for a description of how parallax can be used to determine the distance to an object</a>), Galileo concluded that it must be further away than the Moon &#8212; and thus served as additional evidence that the heavens are not unchanging. Of course, <a href="http://www.space.com/20670-johannes-kepler-supernova-white-dwarf.html" target="_blank">what was seen was actually an exploding star</a>, one that was nearly a trillion times further from the Earth than is the Moon &#8212; but this Galileo could not know.</p>
<p>Next, just a few years later, came the invention of the telescope. Hearing of this device, Galileo quickly built his own and figured out how to improve it. In the following years, armed with telescopes that could provide just 20-times magnification (typical binoculars you can buy can provide 10-times, and with much better optical quality than Galileo&#8217;s assistants could manufacture) came his great string of astronomical discoveries and co-discoveries:</p>
<ul>
<li>the craters on the Moon (proving the Moon has mountains and valleys like the Earth),</li>
<li>the moons of Jupiter (proving that not everything orbits the Earth),</li>
<li>the phases of Venus and its changing apparent size as Venus moves about the sky (proving that Venus orbits the Sun),</li>
<li>the rings of Saturn (demonstrating Saturn is not merely a simple sphere),</li>
<li>sunspots (proving the sun is imperfect, changeable, and rotating),</li>
<li>and the vast number of stars in the Milky Way that aren&#8217;t visible to the naked eye.</li>
</ul>
<p>One often hears 1905 referred to as Einstein&#8217;s miracle year, when he explained Brownian motion and calculated the size of atoms, introduced the notion of quanta of light to explain the photoelectric effect, and wrote his first two papers on special relativity. Well, one could say that Galileo had a miracle decade, most of it concentrated in 1610-1612&#8212; playing the decisive role in destroying the previously dominant Ptolemaic view of the universe, in which the Sun, Moon, planets and stars orbit in <a href="http://zebu.uoregon.edu/~soper/Orbits/ptolemy.gif" target="_blank">a complex system of circles-within-circles around a stationary Earth</a>.</p>
<p>We live in an era where so much more is known about the basic workings of the universe, and where a simple idea or invention is rarely enough to lead to a great change in our understanding of our world and of ourselves. And so I found myself, standing in Galileo&#8217;s courtyard, feeling a moment of nostalgia for that simpler time of the 17th century, cruel and dangerous as it was&#8230; a time when a brilliant scientist could stand on the balcony of his own home, looking through a telescope he&#8217;d designed himself, and change the world-view of a civilization.</p>
