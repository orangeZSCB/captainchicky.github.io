										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple of interesting scientific stories are making the rounds today, and worth a little physics and general science commentary. The first reminds us just how incredibly limited our sensory perceptions are in telling us about the world, by forcing us to imagine how it may look to animals whose perceptions are slightly different. The second reminds us just how little we know about our own planet.<span id="more-7369"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/powerlines-disturb-animal-habitats-by-appearing-as-disturbing-flashes-of-uv-light-invisible-to-the-human-eye-9187631.html" target="_blank">One story that got my attention</a> is that apparently the flashes of ultraviolet light randomly emitted by insulators on electrical power lines are visible to many mammals with whom we share the planet.  And these flashes, up and down a long power line, may be scaring the heck out of them.</p>
<p>Light, or more generally, electromagnetic waves, can occur at any wavelength (the wavelength being the distance from one wavecrest to the next). But we humans see only an extremely narrow range of wavelengths &#8212; from about 0.4 millionths of a meter to about 0.70 millionths of a meter. (For scale; an atom is about 0.0003 millionths of a meter across.  0.7 millionths of a meter is also called 700 nanometers.)</p>
<div style="width: 544px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;cursor:-webkit-zoom-in;" alt="" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.lpi.usra.edu/education/fieldtrips/2005/activities/ir_spectrum/images/emspectrum.jpg" width="534" height="290" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Visible light occupies a tiny part (vastly overestimated in this picture!) of the immense range of wavelengths over which electromagnetic radiation is found in nature, which extends from a good fraction of the size of the universe down to distances far smaller than an atomic nucleus. A nanometer is 0.000,000,001 meters, or about 3 times the size of an atom; we can see only light waves with wavelengths in a small range around 525 nanometers. Many animals can see light that lies a bit to the left of our visible range (i.e. at smaller wavelengths, &#8220;ultraviolet&#8221;) than humans can see; others can see some infrared light (to the right of our visible range, at larger wavelengths). Picture from <a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/education/fieldtrips/2005/activities/" rel="nofollow">http://www.lpi.usra.edu/education/fieldtrips/2005/activities/</a> .</p></div>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">It&#8217;s been known that many animals see light extending down to somewhat smaller wavelengths, but apparently this was thought not to be true of mammals. But recently <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-13529152" target="_blank">reindeer were discovered</a> to have eyes sensitive to light that reaches down to 0.3 millionths of a meter. (We call this &#8220;ultra-violet&#8221; light simply because it is &#8220;beyond-the-violet&#8221; &#8212; smaller wavelengths than the smallest ones that we can see, which appear violet to our brains. It&#8217;s sometimes called near-ultraviolet or UVA, because it&#8217;s just beyond the human visible range.) </span></p>
<p>That slightly broader range of vision is apparently enough to make power line flashes visible to their eyes. It&#8217;s been known that reindeer and other animals have been widely avoiding the areas with power lines, with the effect of fragmenting their habitat and populations (which can endanger them), but it hasn&#8217;t been understood why.  Now it is suggested that these flashes might be the reason.  There may be similar effects on other animals in other places, because it turns out that <a href="http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/281/1780/20132995.abstract" target="_blank">humans and monkeys may be unusual among mammals in not being able to see this slightly ultraviolet light</a>. It may therefore be important, on environmental grounds, for power companies to prevent these flashes completely, which are caused by a buildup of electric charge that is suddenly released into the atmosphere.  It&#8217;s yet another example of the many unexpected and unintended consequences of modern life&#8230; and of the limitations of perceiving the world with only human senses.</p>
<p>Next comes the report that a major step has been taken in the debate as to how much water is stored in part of the Earth&#8217;s interior.</p>
<p>Using earthquake waves as a probe over the past century, geologists have assembled a picture of the Earth (which has a radius of 6400 kilometers [4000 miles]) as consisting of a core of radius of nearly 3500 kilometers, and a mantle, extending from the top of the core nearly to the outer edge of radius of about 2900 kilometers, with a thin crust (typically 10 to a few tens of kilometers [6 &#8211; tens of miles] thick) on which all the continental land and oceans rest. The dense material in the mantle is in some ways like a solid and in some ways like an extremely viscous liquid that can be squeezed and deformed very slowly. <em>(Caution: that&#8217;s a quick over-simplification; the mantle&#8217;s more complex than that.)</em> The mantle&#8217;s details are probably still incompletely known, but there is an upper region extending from the crust down to about 410 km below the surface, and below that is a &#8220;transition zone&#8221; (410–660 km below the surface, or from about 5710 km to about 5960 km from the Earth&#8217;s center), which separates the upper and lower mantle.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s been a long-running debate as to whether the transition zone has a significant amount of water, perhaps dragged down from the ocean floor via the process of <a href="http://earthguide.ucsd.edu/eoc/teachers/t_tectonics/p_subduction.html" target="_blank">subduction</a>. And just recently there&#8217;s been evidence (which I&#8217;ll describe in a moment) that the watery point of view is correct.</p>
<p>In the reporting on this story, a small number of press reports about this have actually bordered on saying that the Earth is now thought to have an underground ocean!  Not so.  A somewhat larger fraction of the press reports have said there&#8217;s an underground &#8220;ocean&#8221;, whatever those quotation marks are supposed to mean. Either way, it&#8217;s pretty misleading. If the water actually is down there, it&#8217;s not stored as liquid water. It would be stored in &#8220;hydrous&#8221; minerals, which contain water not as droplets or pools or puddles but by incorporating individual water <a title="Atoms: Building Blocks of Molecules" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/atoms-building-blocks-of-molecules/" target="_blank">molecules</a> into their molecular structure. An example of a hydrous mineral is <a href="http://www.newark.osu.edu/facultystaff/personal/jstjohn/Documents/Common-minerals/Opal.htm" target="_blank">opal</a>, which certainly isn&#8217;t a puddle.</p>
<p>Also, an &#8220;ocean&#8217;s-worth&#8221; of water may sound like a lot, and in a way it is a lot, but then again, not that much relatively speaking. Let&#8217;s do a little calculation to see what we&#8217;re talking about.</p>
<p>The volume of a sphere of radius r is (4/3) π r<sup>3</sup>, so if you dig out your on-line or off-line calculator, you can check:</p>
<ul>
<li>the volume of the earth is about 1.1 trillion km<sup>3</sup>  (where a trillion = a million times a million)</li>
<li>the volume of the core is about 0.2 trillion km<sup>3</sup></li>
<li>so the volume of the mantle, the difference of the two, is about 0.9 trillion km<sup>3</sup> ~ 82% of Earth&#8217;s volume</li>
<li>the transition zone has 4/3 π ([5960 km]<sup>3</sup> &#8211; [5710 km]<sup>3</sup>) = 0.1 trillion km<sup>3</sup> = 9% of Earth&#8217;s volume</li>
<li><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">the volume of the world&#8217;s oceans = 1.3 billion km</span><sup>3</sup><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;"> = 0.0013 trillion km³ = 0.1% of Earth&#8217;s volume</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Right &#8212; the ocean looks big, but the Earth is 1000 times bigger by volume.  So that means that <strong>even if</strong> an amount of water equal to the earth&#8217;s oceans is inside the mantle&#8217;s transition zone, it is only (by volume) about 1% of the volume of the entire transition zone, and about 0.1% by volume of the Earth as a whole.  Since water is less dense than rock (i.e., it has less mass for the same volume, which is why it is easier to lift a cup of water than a cup filled with rocks), the stored water is a lot less than 1% of the mass of the transition zone, etc.</p>
<p>The new story this week is that a <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/rare-diamond-confirms-that-earths-mantle-holds-an-oceans-worth-of-water/" target="_blank">small ugly diamond from deep underground has been found to contain a tiny, tiny crystal of blue ringwoodite</a> (a very-high-pressure modification of olivine, containing magnesium, iron, silicon and oxygen).  As often happens, the discovery was an accident; the geologists were studying the diamond for another reason.  Ringwoodite, a beautiful blue crystal, is expected to form geologically only in the mantle&#8217;s transition zone, because of the extreme pressure required to make it.  This is the first geologically-produced ringwoodite ever found, and as direct information about the transition zone, it has geologists very excited; maybe, if they look harder, they&#8217;ll find many more examples.</p>
<div style="width: 278px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;" alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/BlueRingwoodite.jpg" width="268" height="234" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Synthesized ringwoodite; from Wikipedia commons.</p></div>
<p>Moreover, ringwoodite is a hydrous min<span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">eral, and this tiny ringwoodite crystal turns out to have a small amount of water incorporated into its structure. And that connects us to our watery story.  From this one tiny piece of evidence, a huge claim has been made that the entire transition zone must be 1% (or so) water, and that therefore there&#8217;s as much water down there as all the world&#8217;s oceans. Or so says the media based on the claims of at least one of the scientists who discovered this evidence.</span></p>
<p><em>&#8220;It&#8217;s actually the confirmation that there is a very, very large amount of water that&#8217;s trapped in a really distinct layer in the deep Earth,&#8221; said Graham Pearson, lead study author and a geochemist at the University of Alberta in Canada.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>But a non-expert like me is bound to ask: shouldn&#8217;t we have a bit more evidence before drawing such a sweeping conclusion? All we could possibly know so far is that at least one part of the transition zone has water incorporated in it. That&#8217;s still interesting, and a strong argument against those who&#8217;ve argued that the transition zone has virtually no water in it. But for all we know, the transition zone may have a highly variable water density, and so there&#8217;s simply no way to draw a conclusion about its total water content from one crystal from one location.  On purely logical grounds, <strong><em>we can&#8217;t yet have confidence that there&#8217;s an ocean&#8217;s-worth of water in the mantle&#8217;s transition zone&#8230; </em></strong><em>despite what the media&#8217;s been saying and that Pearson is implying.  </em>After other scientists have found a few more blue pieces of evidence from completely different locations and found that most or all contain water, then maybe we can start to infer something about the transition region as a whole.</p>
<p>In any case, one shouldn&#8217;t go around thinking of the planet as made of water. Even if it turns out to be true that there&#8217;s as much water in the mantle as there is above ground, we&#8217;re still talking about a few tenths of a percent of the planet&#8217;s volume, and even less of its mass.  Even if it might be a tiny bit wetter than some scientists thought, it&#8217;s still a rocky planet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nothing about quantum physics today, but &#8230; wait, <em>everything</em> is made using quantum physics&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Could you imagine getting a dog to sit absolutely still, while fully awake and listening to voices, for as much as 8 minutes? Researchers trained dogs to do it, then put them in an MRI [Magnetic Resonance Imaging] machine to obtain remarkable studies of how dogs&#8217; brains react to human voices and other emotional forms of human expression. [<a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/nuclear/mri.html" target="_blank">MRI is all about</a> magnetic fields, <a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/" target="_blank">protons</a>, spin, and resonance; particle physics!! more on that another time, perhaps.]   The authors claim this is the first study of its type to compare human brains to those of a non-primate species. Here&#8217;s something from <a href="http://www.cell.com/current-biology/retrieve/pii/S0960982214001237" target="_blank">the scientific article&#8217;s abstract</a>:</p>
<p><em>&#8230;</em><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;"><em>We presented dogs and humans with the same set of vocal and non-vocal stimuli to search for functionally analogous voice-sensitive cortical regions. We demonstrate that voice areas exist in dogs and that they show a similar pattern to anterior temporal voice areas in humans. Our findings also reveal that sensitivity to vocal emotional valence cues engages similarly located non-primary auditory regions in dogs and humans&#8230;</em> </span></p>
<p>So it seems, as dog owners have long suspected, that we&#8217;re not just imagining that our best friends are aware of our moods; they really are similar to us in some important ways.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a BBC article: <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-26276660" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-26276660</a></p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;re done with that, would you like to build up your muscles?  No exercise needed, just call the University of Texas at Dallas.  They&#8217;ve found that <em>&#8220;ordinary fishing line and sewing thread can be cheaply converted to powerful artificial muscles.  The new muscles can lift 100 times more weight and generate 100 times higher mechanical power than a human muscle of the same length and weight&#8230; The muscles are powered thermally by temperature changes, which can be produced electrically, by the absorption of light or by the chemical reaction of fuels.&#8221;</em>  [Quantum Physics = cool!!] The quotation above is from <a href="http://www.utdallas.edu/news/2014/2/21-28701_Researchers-Create-Powerful-Muscles-From-Fishing-L_story-wide.html" target="_blank">an interesting press release from the university</a>, reporting the research which was just published in the journal <em>Science</em>.  I recommend the press release because it mentions several interesting possible applications, including robotics technology  and clothing that adjusts to temperature.  Here&#8217;s also a nice article by Anna Kuchment (who&#8217;s on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/akuchment" target="_blank">here</a>):</p>
<p><a href="http://www.utdallas.edu/news/2014/2/21-28701_Researchers-Create-Powerful-Muscles-From-Fishing-L_story-wide.html" target="_blank">http://www.utdallas.edu/news/2014/2/21-28701_Researchers-Create-Powerful-Muscles-From-Fishing-L_story-wide.html</a></p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Though evolution left us with many wonderful abilities, it does seem that, year by year, humans are becoming less and less practically useful.   But at least our dogs will comfort us in our obsolescence.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome 2014! And quite a start to the year, with a cold snap that rivals anything we&#8217;ve seen in two decades. I don&#8217;t remember cold like this since the horrid winter of 1994, when the Northeastern U.S. saw snowstorms and extreme cold that alternated back and forth for weeks. Of course, when I was a child in the 1970s, such chills happened a lot more often; I remember a number of New England mornings where I awoke to a thermometer reading of -20ºFahrenheit (-29ºCelsius) [244 Kelvin].</p>
<p>The scariest negative temperature numbers that one hears about from the media are associated with the &#8220;wind chill&#8221;, which is a number that is supposed to measure how cold the air &#8220;feels&#8221; to your skin.  But &#8220;wind chill&#8221; is a rather subjective and controversial measure &#8212; there&#8217;s no unique way to define it, since you&#8217;ll feel differently depending on how much exposed skin you have, on your body weight, on your age and conditioning, etc.  By contrast, the temperature measured by a thermometer is defined independent of how humans feel, and experts agree on what it is and means. Oh sure, people use different scales to measure it: Fahrenheit (F), Centigrade or Celsius (C), and Kelvin (K).  But the differences are no more than the distinction between meters and feet, or between kilograms and pounds; it&#8217;s straightforward, if a bit annoying, to convert from one to the other.</p>
<p>So everyone agrees the temperature is and <em>feels</em> extremely cold, But <strong>is it</strong>, from the point of nature, <strong>really that much colder than usual?</strong> To say it another way: it was 84ºF (29ºC) in southern Florida yesterday.  How much warmer is that than the -40ºF (-40ºC) that was registered in the cold Minnesota morning?</p>
<p>Well, you might first think: wow, it&#8217;s a difference of 124ºF (69ºC), which sounds like a <strong>huge</strong> difference.  But is it really so huge?<span id="more-7087"></span></p>
<p><strong>Perception and Reality</strong></p>
<p>We humans experience the world through our perceptions and our consciousness &#8212; through what we see, hear, feel, and so forth. And as is natural, we tend to assume that what we see, hear and feel correctly represents the world <em>as it is</em>. But in fact, as scientists have learned over the past centuries, the devices we use for our perceptions &#8212; eyes, ears, temperature-sensing nerves, and so on &#8212; filter and process the information that they receive from the outside world. Our brain then does further processing.  By the time the information enters our conscious notion of the world, the world has become a caricature, a cartoon, of the real thing.  Much of the world is ignored, and the part that we are conscious of is transformed almost beyond recognition.</p>
<p>Indeed, one of the first things young science students have to do is unlearn almost everything our senses and brains tell us about the world, and relearn it almost from scratch.</p>
<p>So it is with hot and cold. In the real world there is no such thing as a &#8220;hot object&#8221; or a &#8220;cold object.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, there really <strong>is</strong> such a thing as temperature. One can speak of &#8220;hotter&#8221; and &#8220;colder&#8221;; if A is hotter than B, then, very simply, A has a higher temperature than B.</p>
<p>But it makes no sense to say &#8220;A <strong><em>is</em></strong> hot&#8221;. The statement that &#8220;A is hot&#8221; is a misconception, a trick that our senses play on us.  What this really just means is that, to your skin&#8217;s nerves, &#8220;A <strong><em>feels</em></strong> hot&#8221;. And what that usually means, in the real world, is &#8220;A is hotter &#8212; has a higher temperature &#8212; than your skin&#8221;.  As always the full story&#8217;s a bit more complicated, but not too much.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s always good when you can do a simple experiment, on your own, to reveal some basic fact about the world.  There&#8217;s a nice one in this case. Take three bowls; fill one with ice water (literally, water with ice in it), fill a second with water that&#8217;s almost too hot for you to put your hand in, and fill the third with ordinary tap water that&#8217;s lukewarm. Now put your left hand in the ice water and your right hand in the hot water. After a minute or so, take them out and put them both in the tepid water. How hot is that water?</p>
<p>You will find you are of two minds. Your cold hand will feel the tepid water is hot, and your hot hand will feel it is cold. And this is because the tepid water is hotter than your cold hand, and colder than your hot hand. Thus you may easily learn: what you feel as hot and cold is <em>not a measure of the world, but rather a measure of <strong>you relative to</strong> the world.</em></p>
<p>In other words, we humans are not thermometers; our nerves and brains don&#8217;t tell us the temperature of a thing, just whether it is hotter or colder than some temperature we find comfortable. <em>[In fact our nerves don&#8217;t even tell us how much hotter or colder another object is; they actually tell us something about how quickly heat is flowing out of or into our bodies from the object that we&#8217;re sensing, which is why, when you pull clothing from a hot clothes dryer, the metal zipper feels so much hotter than the cloth does. But more on that another time.]</em></p>
<p><strong>So what is temperature?</strong></p>
<p>In most ordinary situations, you can think of temperature in a simple way (though I should note that a more sophisticated view is sometimes needed.) Every material object that we find around us &#8212; tables, air, bricks, glass, alcohol &#8212; is made from <a title="Atoms: Building Blocks of Molecules" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/atoms-building-blocks-of-molecules/" target="_blank">molecules</a> characteristic of that material. In any material, the molecules, vastly too small for you and I to see, are moving, fast and randomly, and banging into each other. Some are moving faster than others, and they&#8217;re heading in all directions. In a solid, they don&#8217;t move far; they just rattle in place. In a liquid or gas, they can move all around, but they don&#8217;t go far without banging into each other, and when they collide their speed and direction change. Because they&#8217;re constantly running into each other, each molecule is moving sometimes faster, sometimes slower&#8230; but the molecules never stop moving.</p>
<p><em>[This might confuse your intuition. You&#8217;re used to large objects that you can see, like soccer balls and cardboard boxes and pens, slowing down and stopping. That&#8217;s because, on the Earth&#8217;s surface, large objects generally end up sliding over the ground or the floor, and friction slows them down. Molecules aren&#8217;t subject to friction, so they keep moving. In fact friction is a process in which large objects gradually lose their motion-energy (technically, &#8220;kinetic&#8221; energy) and hand it over to molecules!]</em></p>
<p>The temperature of an ordinary material is simply <strong><em>a measure of the average amount of random, invisible motion that the molecules in that material are undergoing</em></strong>, or, more precisely, <em><strong>a measure of the average speed and motion-energy that those molecules have. </strong> </em>Molecules in colder objects move more slowly than molecules in hotter objects; that&#8217;s all there is to temperature!</p>
<p>Here again, our senses fail us. Look at the table in front of you. Your senses do not tell you that the molecules in that table are randomly wiggling around. Of course your senses don&#8217;t even tell you that the table is made from molecules, so it&#8217;s not surprising they don&#8217;t reveal their motion&#8230; but there aren&#8217;t even apparent fuzzy edges to the table, which you might have naively expected. And our senses don&#8217;t tell us that even on a calm day, with no wind, the molecules of the air surrounding us are zipping around at a cool 1600 feet (500 meters) <em><strong>per second</strong></em> &#8212; faster than the speed of sound, and around five times the wind speeds of the most powerful hurricanes.</p>
<p>This incredible rain of molecules against your body doesn&#8217;t knock you over because, unlike hurricane wind, which pushes you in a particular direction, the random motions of the molecules push you in all directions, and therefore, in no direction at all. The molecules do exert pressure on your skin, but your body pushes back; if it didn&#8217;t it would collapse, so of course evolution has assured that it does.  Yet your senses don&#8217;t even bother to tell you that all this is happening.  Why?  Because this pressure is just part of the scenery of being alive on the surface of the Earth, and your survival doesn&#8217;t depend upon you knowing about it, anymore than it depends upon you knowing that molecules exist at all.</p>
<p><strong>How much hotter is Florida than Minnesota?</strong></p>
<p>Now that it&#8217;s clear what temperature is, we can ask how large, really, is the change from the 84ºF (29ºC) [301 K] temperature felt in daytime in southern Florida and the -40ºF (-40ºC) [233 K] temperatures felt in early morning in northern Minnesota? The temperature difference, subtracting the colder number from the hotter one, sounds dramatic, but doesn&#8217;t answer to the question. We have to focus something else.</p>
<p>For this purpose, the outdated Fahrenheit scale is hopeless. The number of degrees doesn&#8217;t correspond to anything very easy to remember. You just have to memorize how the Fahrenheit scale works: water boils at 212ºF and freezes at 32ºF, and that&#8217;s for weird historical reasons.</p>
<p>The Centigrade, or Celsius, system (Celsius invented it in 1743) is much easier to remember, and almost the whole world uses it in daily life. 0ºC is where water freezes; 100ºC is where it boils. But while that&#8217;s convenient when you want to know if the temperature is below freezing, it&#8217;s not convenient to determine the answer to our question.</p>
<p>No, if you want to understand really how much hotter is air at 84ºF (29ºC) than air at -40ºF (-40ºC), you need the Kelvin scale. The Kelvin scale is very easy to use.  For one thing, it&#8217;s really the same as the number of degrees in Centigrade/Celsius scale, <strong>plus 273.15</strong> &#8212; and that&#8217;s it. I&#8217;ll just approximate this shift by 273, to keep my numbers simple.</p>
<p>Thus water</p>
<ul>
<li>freezes at 273 K, and</li>
<li>boils at 100 + 273 = 373 K.</li>
</ul>
<p>What&#8217;s this magic number &#8220;273.15&#8221;? Well, 0 K = -273.15 ºC = -459.67 F is the temperature at which <strong>the amount of motion-energy per molecule reaches zero, and the molecules stop moving.</strong> <em>[Almost true! Due to the jitter inherent in quantum mechanics, the molecules never <strong>quite</strong> stop moving, and the motion-energy is never <strong>quite</strong> zero. But the motion and the motion-energy are far too small for us to worry about for today.]</em> In other words, it is impossible to have a lower temperature than zero Kelvin! This lowest possible temperature is called &#8220;absolute zero&#8221;, which is why the Kelvin scale starts there. 0 K simply corresponds to the lowest possible motion-energy per molecule, which for most practical purposes might as well be literally zero.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s the advantage of the Kelvin scale: <strong>the temperature of the object in Kelvin is directly proportional to the energy of its molecules.</strong> An object with a temperature of 200 K has twice as much motion-energy per molecule as one with a temperature of 100 K, and half as much motion-energy per molecule as one with a temperature of 400 K.</p>
<p>Well, that suggests to us how we should answer the question: How much hotter is object B than object A? Now that we have a scale for which all temperatures are positive, we can take a ratio of their two temperatures, T<sub>B</sub>/T<sub>A</sub>. If B is hotter than A, the ratio is greater than 1; if B is colder, the ratio is less than 1.  If that ratio is, say, 1.2 &#8212; if the temperature of B is 20% larger than the temperature of A &#8212; that tells us that the molecules in B have energy 20% larger than those in A. <strong><em>Remember this is only true if we use the Kelvin scale, and not Fahrenheit or Celsius</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the reason not to use the temperature <em>difference</em>, T<sub>B</sub> &#8211; T<sub>A</sub>, is that its meaning is ambiguous. A difference of 5 K would be very large if B is at 6 K and A at 1 K &#8212; B is six times hotter than A &#8212; but would be a tiny effect if B is at 60,000 K and A is at 59,995 K, in which case the difference in the two temperatures is a very small fraction of a percent.</p>
<p>I hope you now begin to see why scientists use the Kelvin scale. It is a scale that relates a property of <em>visible macroscopic</em> objects, as measured in <strong>temperature</strong>, to the level of activity of the <em>invisible microscopic molecules</em> out of which the objects are made, as measured in <strong>motion-energy</strong> (or &#8220;kinetic&#8221; energy). If the temperature is large, so is the energy per molecule; as one drops to zero, so does the other.</p>
<p><strong>So how cold is this week&#8217;s cold snap?</strong></p>
<p>Yesterday, in southern Florida the high temperature was 301 K, and the low temperature was 233 K in northern Minnesota. The ratio of the two temperatures is simply 301/233 = 1.29. We may say that Florida was as much as 29% hotter than Minnesota, meaning, specifically, that the average air molecule in Miami in the afternoon had 29% more energy than the average air molecule in Duluth at dawn.</p>
<p>Is that a lot, or not? Motion-energy increases as speed <strong>squared</strong> <em>(E<sub>motion </sub>= ½mv², for an object of mass m traveling at a speed v that is much slower than the speed of light)</em> so it only takes 14% more speed to give you 29% more motion-energy.  That means a car driving 68 miles per hour (114 km/hour) has 29% more motion-energy than a car driving 60 miles per hour (100 km/hour).  So think about that when you are commuting to work. <strong><em>When you accelerate from 60 to 68 miles per hour, you&#8217;ve increased your speed by enough to turn this morning&#8217;s Duluth into this afternoon&#8217;s Miami.  </em></strong></p>
<p>That said, the molecules are a bit speedier.  Compared to those slow-pokes in Duluth, which crawl along at a mere 980 miles per hour (1640 km/hour), the average molecule in Miami is traveling about 1100 miles per hour (1850 km/hour), about 14% faster.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s a matter of perspective.  Biologically speaking, the difference between Florida and Minnesota is enormous; you can survive in one for months, and in the other for minutes.  This is in large part because between comfortable Key West and dangerous Duluth lies the temperature where water turns to ice, and so your body, being more than half water, will start to freeze solid in the cold, not to mention being unable to maintain the internal warmth it needs to function.  And yet, for the nitrogen and oxygen molecules in the air, the cool-down is a rather small change&#8230; no more than slowing down on the highway from 68 miles an hour to 60 miles an hour (114 km per hour to 100 km per hour.)   They barely notice the difference!</p>
<p>We should be very grateful to live on such a stable planet, whose hottest surface temperature (about 130ºF= 54ºC = 328 K) and coldest surface temperature (about -130ºF = -90ºC = 183 K) are only different by a factor of 328/183 = 1.8 &#8212; and of course those temperatures are unusual, and only occur in unique places.  Compare that with the Moon, where high temperatures (214ºF = 101ºC = 374 K) and low temperatures (-300ºF = -184ºC = 89 K) vary by a factor of 374/89 = 4.2.  Out in the wider universe, it&#8217;s a little more drastic. The center of the sun reaches a blazing temperature of 27,000,000ºF = 15,000,000ºC = 15,000,000 K (approximately).  Meanwhile the ancient photons (the particles of electromagnetic radiation which make up the &#8220;cosmic microwave background&#8221;) that fill outer space would warm you to just under 3 K. The ratio of the two temperatures is about 5,000,000.</p>
<p>Home Sweet Home.  Even when it runs a little cold.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<pre><span style="color:#008000;"><em>For general readership</em></span></pre>
<p>Evolution really happens in nature: we know this from the frightening rate at which bacterial species, faced with our most powerful antibiotics, manage to find ways around them.</p>
<p>More precisely, a certain amount of natural variability and accidental mutations within bacterial populations, and the huge rate at which bacteria reproduce themselves (a single bacterium at dawn may be billions by sunset), essentially assures that eventually, simply by accident, and relatively soon, a bacterium will be &#8220;<a href="http://www.microbiologyonline.org.uk/about-microbiology/introducing-microbes/bacteria" target="_blank">born</a>&#8221; that is immune to any particular antibiotic. And then this bacterium, the sole survivor of the onslaught to which its siblings have succumbed, and reproducing by dividing into &#8220;children&#8221; that also can survive, soon gives rise to a subspecies of its own, against which this antibiotic is useless.  By using the antibiotic again and again, killing off the bacteria from other subspecies, we eventually assure that this unbeatable subspecies becomes more and more common compared to its cousins.</p>
<p>In recent years, bacteria have appeared for which no antibiotic treatment exists.  The rate of the evolution of these bacteria has outpaced the rate at which biologists and medical researchers can find and develop new antibiotic treatments.  The Center for Disease Control is extremely worried about this, and its director Tom Frieden just <a href="http://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/2013/11/20/a-nightmare-health-scenario-we-can-stop/" target="_blank">published a blog post</a> that <strong>everyone</strong> should read.  Here&#8217;s one quotation:</p>
<p><em>To help draw attention to CRE and other top antibiotic-resistance threats, the Center for Disease Control recently published its first <a href="https://bluprd0711.outlook.com/owa/redir.aspx?C=kw63zUVErUGmH24bhOwm8YqzjSY0udAI_1FuSvMwodmcYRRc-Y565bfY2GoMJVV6dV2Wv-OWwY8.&amp;URL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.cdc.gov%2fdrugresistance%2fthreat-report-2013%2f" target="_blank">report</a> on the current antibiotic resistance threat to the U.S. The report estimates that each year in the United States, at least 2 million people become infected with bacteria resistant to antibiotics, and at least 23,000 people die as a result.</em></p>
<p>Note this extraordinary statement: every year, 1 in 150 people in the United States will be infected with bacteria that are resistant to a classic antibiotic every year, and 1% of them will die, some fraction of them because of this resistance.  Let&#8217;s put that in perspective: assuming there were no increase in the number of bacteria or improvements in treatment over the next 50 years, your chance of being infected by such a bacterium during that time is roughly 25%.  In short, this will very likely happen to someone you know in the next few years, and someone in your family in coming decades.  (It&#8217;s already happened to someone in my extended family.)  And of course, since they are hard to fight, these bacteria are likely to spread, so the rate of infection will become worse if nothing is done.</p>
<p><span style="color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">Here&#8217;s another quotation: </span></p>
<p><em>Every doctor must commit to use antibiotics only when needed, and to use antibiotics for only as long as they are needed. Patients need to understand that “more” drugs does not equal “better” drugs. The <i>right</i> treatment is the <i>best</i> treatment – and that isn’t antibiotics for every infection or every illness.</em></p>
<p>Now why is he making this point so strongly? Let me end by quoting from the preamble to the report he mentions:</p>
<p><em>The use of antibiotics is the single most important factor leading to antibiotic resistance </em><em>around the world. Antibiotics are among the most commonly prescribed drugs used </em><em>in human medicine. However, up to 50% of all the antibiotics prescribed for people are </em><em>not needed or are not optimally effective as prescribed. Antibiotics are also commonly </em><em>used in food animals to prevent, control, and treat disease, and to promote the growth </em><em>of food-producing animals. The use of antibiotics for promoting growth is not necessary, </em><br />
<em>and the practice should be phased out.</em></p>
<p>I hope everyone pays close attention to Frieden&#8217;s post and its message, and spreads the word among the people that they know.  Doing so may someday help save the life of someone you care about, or even your own.</p>
