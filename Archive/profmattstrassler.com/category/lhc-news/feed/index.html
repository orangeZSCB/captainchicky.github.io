										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, astronomers Heino Falcke, Fulvio Melia and Eric Agol (a former colleague of mine at the University of Washington) pointed out that the black hole at the center of our galaxy, the Milky Way, was probably big enough to be observed &#8212; not with a usual camera using visible light, but using radio waves and clever techniques known as &#8220;interferometry&#8221;.Â  Soon it was pointed out that the black hole in M87, further but larger, could also be observed.Â  <em>[How? <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/04/09/a-non-experts-guide-to-a-black-holes-silhouette/">I explained this yesterday in this post.</a>]Â Â Â </em></p>
<p>And today, an image of the latter, looking quite similar to what we expected, was presented to humanity.Â  Just as with the discovery of the Higgs boson, and with LIGO&#8217;s first discovery of gravitational waves, nature, captured by the hard work of an international group of many scientists, gives us something definitive, uncontroversial, and spectacularly in line with expectations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://lhcb-public.web.cern.ch/lhcb-public/">LHCb experiment</a> at the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/">Large Hadron Collider</a> is dedicated mainly to the study of mesons <em>[objects made from a quark of one type, an anti-quark of another type, plus many other particles]</em> that contain <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/">bottom quarks</a> (hence the `b&#8217; in the name).Â  But it also can be used to study many other things, including mesons containing <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/">charm quarks</a>.</p>
<p>By examining large numbers of mesons that contain a charm quark and an up anti-quark (or a charm anti-quark and an up quark) and studying carefully how they <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/why-do-particles-decay/most-particles-decay-why/">decay</a>, the LHCb experimenters have discovered a new example of violations of <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/c-p-t-and-their-combinations/">the transformations known as CP</a> <em>(C: exchange of particle with anti-particle; P: reflection of the world in a mirror)</em>, of the sort that have been previously seen in mesons containing strange quarks and mesons containing bottom quarks.Â  Here&#8217;s <a href="https://home.cern/news/press-release/physics/lhcb-sees-new-flavour-matter-antimatter-asymmetry">the press release</a>.</p>
<p>Congratulations to LHCb!Â  This important addition to our basic knowledge is consistent with expectations; CP violation of roughly this size is predicted by the formulas that make up the Standard Model of Particle Physics.Â  However, our predictions are very rough in this context; it is sometimes difficult to make accurate calculations <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/protons-and-neutrons/">when the strong nuclear force</a>, which holds mesons (as well as protons and neutrons) together, is involved.Â  So this is a real coup for LHCb, but not a game-changer for particle physics.Â  Perhaps, sometime in the future, theorists will learn how to make predictions as precise as LHCb&#8217;s measurement!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A little while back I wrote a <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/02/13/breaking-a-little-new-ground-at-the-large-hadron-collider/">short post</a> about some research that some colleagues and I did using &#8220;open data&#8221; from the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC]. We used data made public by the <a href="https://home.cern/science/experiments/cms">CMS experimental collaboration</a> &#8212; about 1% of their current data &#8212; to search for a new particle, using a couple of twists (as proposed over 10 years ago) on a standard technique.Â  (CMS is one of the two general-purpose particle detectors at the LHC; the other is called ATLAS.)Â  We had two motivations: (1) Even if we didn&#8217;t find a new particle, we wanted to prove that our search method was effective; and (2) we wanted to stress-test the CMS Open Data framework, to assure it really does provide all the information needed for a search for something unknown.</p>
<p><a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/02/19/a-broad-search-for-fast-hidden-particles/">Recently I discussed</a> (1), and today I want to address (2): to convey why open data from the LHC is useful but controversial, and why we felt it was important, as theoretical physicists <em>(i.e. people who perform particle physics calculations, but do not build and run the actual experiments)</em>, to do something with it that is usually the purview of experimenters.</p>
<p><strong>The Importance of Archiving Data</strong></p>
<p>In many subfields of physics and astronomy, data from experiments is made public as a matter of routine. Usually this occurs after an substantial delay, to allow the experimenters who collected the data to analyze it first for major discoveries. That&#8217;s as it should be: the experimenters spent years of their lives proposing, building and testing the experiment, and they deserve an uninterrupted opportunity to investigate its data. To force them to release data immediately would create a terrible disincentive for anyone to do all the hard work!</p>
<p>Data from particle physics colliders, however, has not historically been made public. More worrying, it has rarely been archived in a form that is easy for others to use at a later date. I&#8217;m not the right person to tell you the history of this situation, but I can give you a sense for why this still happens today.<span id="more-10236"></span></p>
<p>The fundamental issue is the complexity of data sets from colliders, especially from <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-hadron-as-in-large-hadron-collider/">hadron</a> colliders such as the Tevatron and the LHC. (Archiving was partly done for <a href="https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-electron-positron-collider">LEP</a>, a simpler collider, and was used in later studies including <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1003.0705">this search for unusual Higgs decays</a>Â  and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06536">this controversial observation,</a> also <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2016/10/21/hiding-from-a-nightmare/">discussed here</a>.) What &#8220;complexity&#8221; are we talking about? Collisions of <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/">protons</a> and/or anti-protons are intrinsically complicated; particles of all sorts go <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/2114779/files/diphoton_v0.png">flying in all directions</a>. The general purpose particle detectors ATLAS and CMS have a complex shape and aren&#8217;t uniform. (Here&#8217;s <a href="https://cms.cern/detector">a cutaway image showing CMS as a set of nested almost-cylinders</a>. Note also that there are inherent weak points: places where cooling tubes have to run, where bundles of wires have to bring signals in and out of the machine, and where segments of the detector join together.) Meanwhile the interactions of the particles with the detector&#8217;s material is messy and often subtle (here&#8217;s <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/2270046/files/Figure_001.png">a significantly oversimplified view</a>). Not every particle is detected, and the probability of missing one depends on where it passes through the detector and what type of particle it is.</p>
<p>Even more important, 99.999% percent of ATLAS and CMS data is discarded as it comes in; only data which passes a set of filters, collectively called <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/the-trigger-discarding-all-but-the-gold/">the &#8220;trigger,&#8221;</a> will even be stored. The trigger is adjusted regularly as experimental conditions change. If you don&#8217;t understand these filters in detail, you can&#8217;t understand the data. Meanwhile the strategies for processing the raw data change over time, becoming more sophisticated, and introducing their own issues that must be known and managed.</p>
<p>I could easily go on (did I mention that at the LHC <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/1479324/files/198609-56-3565522e.png">dozens of collisions occur simultaneously?</a>) If, when you explore the data, you fail to account for all these issues, you can mistake a glitch for a new physical effect, or fail to observe a new physical effect because a glitch obscured it. Any experimentalist inside the collaborations is aware of most of these subtleties, and is surrounded by other experts who will be quick to complain if he or she forgets to account for one of them. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s rare for the experimenters to report a result that has this type of error embedded in it.</p>
<p>Now,<strong><em> imagine writing a handbook that would encapsulate all of that combined knowledge, for use by people who will someday analyze the data without having access to that collective human library.</em></strong> This handbook would accompany an enormous data set taken in changing conditions, and would need to contain everything a person could possibly need to know in order to properly analyze data from an LHC experiment without making a technical error.</p>
<p><strong>Not easy!</strong> But this is what the <a href="http://opendata.cern.ch/">Open Data project at CERN</a>, in which CMS is one of the participating experiments, aims to do. Because it&#8217;s extremely difficult, and therefore expensive in personnel and time, its value has to be clear.</p>
<p>I personally do think the value <strong><em>is</em></strong> clear, especially at the LHC. Until the last couple of decades, one could argue that data from an old particle physics experiment would go out of date so quickly, superseded by better experiments, that it really wasn&#8217;t needed. But this argument has broken down as experiments have become more expensive, with new ones less frequent. There is no guarantee, for instance, that any machine superseding the LHC will be built during my lifetime; it is a minimum of 20 and perhaps 40 years away. In all that time, the LHC&#8217;s data will be the state of the art in proton-proton collider physics, so it ought to be stored so that experts can use it 25 years from now. The price for making that possible has to be paid.</p>
<p><em>[This price was not paid for the Tevatron, whose data, which will remain the gold standard for <strong>proton-antiproton</strong> collisions for perhaps a century or more, is not well-archived.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Was Using Open Data Necessary For Our Project?</strong></p>
<p>Even if we all agree that it&#8217;s important to archive LHC data so that it can be used by future experimental physicists, it&#8217;s not obvious that <strong><em>today&#8217;s theorists</em> </strong>should use it. There&#8217;s an alternative: a theorist with a particular idea can temporarily join one of the experimental collaborations, and carry out the research with like-minded experimental colleagues. In principle, this is a much better way to do things; it permits access to the full data set, it allows the expert experimentalists to handle and manage the data instead of amateurs like us, and it should in principle lead to state-of-the-art results.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t found this approach to work. I&#8217;ve been recommending the use of our technique <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/02/19/a-broad-search-for-fast-hidden-particles/"><em>[selecting events where the transverse momentum of the muon and antimuon pair is large, and often dropping isolation requirements]</em></a> for over ten years, along with several related techniques. These remarks appear in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0712.2041">papers</a>; I&#8217;ve mentioned these issues in <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/94815/contributions/1282671/">many talks</a>, discussed them in detail with at least two dozen experimentalists at ATLAS and CMS (including many colleagues at Harvard), and even started a preliminary project with an experimenter to study them. But everyone had a reason not to proceed. I was told, over and over again, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, we&#8217;ll get to this next year.&#8221; After a decade of this, I came to feel that perhaps it would be best if we carried out the analysis ourselves.</p>
<p>Even then, there was an alternative: we could have just done a study of our method using simulated data, and this would have proved the value of our technique. Why spend the huge amount of time and effort to do a detailed analysis, on a fraction of the real data?</p>
<p>First, I worried that a study on simulated data would be no more effective than all of the talks I gave and all the personal encouraging I did over the previous ten years. I think seeing the study done for real has a lot more impact, because it shows explicitly how effective the technique is and how easily it is implemented. <em>[Gosh, if even theorists can do it&#8230;]</em></p>
<p>Second, one of the things we did in our study is include &#8220;non-isolated muons&#8221; &#8212; muons that have other particles close by &#8212; which are normally not included in theorists&#8217; studies. Dropping the usual isolation criteria may be essential for discoveries of hidden particles, as Kathryn Zurek and I have emphasized since 2006 (and studied in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0712.2041">a paper with Han and Si, in 2007</a>). I felt it was important to show this explicitly in our study. But we needed the real data to do this; simulation of the background sources for non-isolated muons would not have been accurate. <em>[The experimenters rarely use non-isolated muons in the type of analysis we carried out, but notably <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01890">have been doing so here</a>; my impression is that they were unaware of our work from 2007 and came to this approach independently.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Stress Testing the Archive</strong></p>
<p>A further benefit to using the real data was that we stress-tested the archiving procedure in the Open Data project, and to do this fully, we had to carry out our analysis to the very end. The success or failure of our analysis was a test of whether the CMS Open Data framework truly provides all the information needed to do a complete search for something unknown.</p>
<p>The test received a passing grade, with qualifications. Not only we did complete the project, we were able to repeat a rather precise measurement of the (well-known) cross-section for Z boson production, which would have failed if the archive and the accompanying information had been unusable. That said, there is room for improvement: small things were missing, including some calibration information and some simulated data. The biggest issue is perhaps the format for the data storage (difficult to use and unpack for a typical user).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to recognize that the persons in charge of Open Data at CMS have a huge and difficult job; they have to figure out how to write the nearly impossible handbook I referred to above. It&#8217;s therefore crucial that people like our group of theorists actually use the open data sets <em><strong>now</strong></em>, not just after the LHC is over. <em><strong>Now</strong></em>, when the open data sets are still small, is the time to figure out what information is missing, to determine how to improve the data storage, to fill out the documentation and make sure it has no gaps. We hope we&#8217;ve contributed something to that process.</p>
<p><strong>The Future</strong></p>
<p>Should others follow in our footsteps? Yes, I think, though not lightly. In our case, five experts required two years to do the simplest possible study; we could have done it in one year if we&#8217;d been more efficient, but probably not much less. Do not underestimate what this takes, both in terms of understanding the data and learning how to do statistical analysis that most people rarely undertake.</p>
<p>But there are studies that simply cannot be done without real data, and unless you can convince an experimentalist to work with you, your only choice may be to dive in and do your best. And if you are already somewhat informed, but want to learn more about how real experimental analysis is done, so you can appreciate more fully what is typically hidden from view, you will not find a better self-training ground. If you want to take it on, I suggest, as an initial test, that you try to replicate our measurement of the Z boson cross-section. If you can&#8217;t, you&#8217;re not ready for anything else.</p>
<p>I should emphasize that Open Data is a resource that can be used in other ways, and several groups have already done this. In addition to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05842">detailed studies</a> of <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/jets-the-manifestation-of-quarks-and-gluons/">jets</a> carried out on the <em><strong>real</strong></em> data by my collaborators, led by Professor Jesse Thaler, there have been <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11916">studies</a> that have relied solely on the archive of <em><strong>simulated</strong></em> data also provided by the CMS Open Data project. These have value too, in that they offer proving grounds for techniques to be applied later to real data. Since exploratory studies of simulated data don&#8217;t require the extreme care that analysis of real data demands, there may be a lot of potential in this aspect of the Open Data project.</p>
<p>In the end, our research study, like most analyses, is just a drop in the huge bucket of information learned from the LHC. Its details should not obscure the larger question: <em><strong>how shall we, as a community, maintain the LHC data set so that it can continue to provide information across the decades?</strong></em> Maybe the Open Data project is the best approach.Â  If so, how can we best support it?Â  And if not, what is the alternative?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few days ago I wrote <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/02/13/breaking-a-little-new-ground-at-the-large-hadron-collider/">a quick summary of a project that we just completed</a> (and you may find it helpful to read that post first). In this project, we looked for new particles at the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">Large Hadron Collider</a> (LHC) in a novel way, in two senses. Today I&#8217;m going to explain what we did, why we did it, and what was unconventional about our search strategy.</p>
<p>The first half of this post will be appropriate for any reader who has been following particle physics as a spectator sport, or in some similar vein. In the second half, I&#8217;ll add some comments for my expert colleagues that may be useful in understanding and appreciating some of our results.Â  <em>[If you just want to read the comments for experts, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/02/19/a-broad-search-for-fast-hidden-particles/#experts">jump here</a>.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Why did we do this?</strong></p>
<p>Motivation first. Why, as theorists, would we attempt to take on the role of our experimental colleagues &#8212; to try on our own to analyze the extremely complex and challenging data from the LHC? We&#8217;re by no means experts in data analysis, and we were very slow at it. And on top of that, we only had access to 1% of the data that CMS has collected. Isn&#8217;t it obvious that there is no chance whatsoever of finding something new with just 1% of the data, since the experimenters have had years to look through much larger data sets?<span id="more-10224"></span></p>
<p>Not only isn&#8217;t it obvious, it&#8217;s <strong>false</strong>. In an immense data set, unexpected phenomena can hide, and if you ask the wrong questions, they may not reveal themselves. This has happened before, and it will happen again.</p>
<p>Conventional thinking, before the LHC and still today, is that new phenomena will likely appear in the form of particles with large rest masses. The logic? You <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/naturalness/">can&#8217;t easily explain</a> the patterns of particles in the Standard Model without adding some new, slightly heavier ones.Â  Crudely speaking, this would lead you to look for particles with the largest rest masses you can reach, which is limited by the energy of your machine, because of E=mcÂ². That&#8217;s why the LHC was expected to find more than just the Higgs particle, and why the machine proposed for the post-LHC era at CERN is a larger copy of the LHC, with more energy in each collision.</p>
<p>This point of view is based on strong, reasonable arguments; please don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m criticizing it as foolish. But there have long been cracks in those arguments. Studies of so-called &#8220;gauge-mediated&#8221; supersymmetry breaking in the mid 1990s, which revealed a vast world of previously ignored phenomena. The discovery of the cosmological constant in 1998, which clearly violated conventional reasoning. The possibilities of relatively large unobserved dimensions of space (which we, like blind flies stuck between panes of glass, can&#8217;t detect), which showed how little confidence we should have in what we think we know. The model known as the Twin Higgs in 2005, which showed how the new heavy particles might exist, but could hide from the LHC.</p>
<p>In this context, it should not have been a total shock &#8212; just a painful one &#8212; that so far the LHC has not <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-discovery-of-the-higgs/">found anything other than a Higgs boson</a>, using conventional searches.</p>
<p>Indeed, the whole story of my 30-year career has been watching the conventional reasoning gradually break down. I cannot explain why some of my colleagues were so confident in it, but I hope their depression medication is working well. I myself view the evisceration of conventional wisdom as potentially very exciting, as well as very challenging.</p>
<p>And if you&#8217;re a bit unconventional, you might wonder whether particles that are insensitive to all the known forces (except gravity) might have an unexpected role to play in explaining the mysteries of particle physics. Importantly, <em><strong>these (and only these) types of particles could have arbitrarily low rest mass and yet have escaped discovery up to now.<br />
</strong></em></p>
<p>This unconventional thinking has made some headway into the LHC community, and there have been quite a number of searches for these &#8220;hidden&#8221; particles. <strong>BUT</strong>&#8230; not nearly enough of them.Â  The problem is that (a) such particles might be produced in any of a hundred different ways, and (b) they might disintegrate (&#8220;<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/why-do-particles-decay/most-particles-decay-why/">decay</a>&#8221;) in any of a hundred different ways, meaning that there are many thousands of different ways they might show up in our experiments. Don&#8217;t quote me on the numbers here; they&#8217;re for effect. The point is that there&#8217;s a lot of work to do if we&#8217;re going to be sure that we did a thorough search for hidden particles. And one thing I can assure you: this work has not yet been done.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the number of searches required is a lot smaller than thousands&#8230; but still large: dozens, probably. The simplest one of them &#8212; one that even theorists could do, and barely qualifying as &#8220;unconventional&#8221; &#8212; is to look for a hidden particle that (1) decays sometimes to a muon/anti-muon pair, and (2) is initially produced with a hard kick&#8230; like shrapnel from an explosion. In colloquial terms, we might say that it&#8217;s faster than typical, perhaps very close to the speed of light. In Physicese, it has substantial <em><strong>momentum</strong> [and at the LHC we have to look for momentum perpendicular (&#8220;transverse&#8221;) to the proton beams.]<br />
</em></p>
<p>There&#8217;s an obvious way to look for fast hidden particles, and it requires only one simple step beyond the conventional. And if you take that step, you have a much better chance of success than if you take the conventional route&#8230; so much better than in some cases you might find something, even with 1% of the data, that nobody had yet noticed. And even if you find nothing, you might convince the experts that this is an excellent approach, worth applying on the big data sets.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s <em><strong>why</strong></em> we did it. Now a few more details.</p>
<p><strong>What we did</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing new about looking for new particles that sometimes decay to muon/anti-muon pairs; several particles have been discovered this way, including the Z boson and the Upsilon (a mini-atom made from a bottom quark/anti-quark pair.) It&#8217;s not even particularly unconventional to look for that pair to carry a lot of transverse momentum. But to use these as the<strong><em> only</em></strong> requirements in a search &#8212; this is a bit unconventional, and to my knowledge has not been done before.</p>
<p>Why add this unconventional element in the first place? Because, as Kathryn Zurek and I emphasized long ago, the best way to discover low-mass hidden particles is often to look for them in the decay of a heavier particle; it may be the most common way they are produced, and even if it isn&#8217;t, it&#8217;s often the most spectacular production mechanism, and thus the easiest to detect. Indeed, when a particle is produced in the decay of another, it often acts like shrapnel &#8212; it goes flying.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s hard to detect such a particle (let&#8217;s call it &#8220;V&#8221;, because of the shape the muon and anti-muon make in the picture below) if it decays before it has moved appreciably from the location where it was created. In that case, your only clue of its existence is <strong><em>the shrapnel&#8217;s shrapnel</em></strong>: the muon and anti-muon that appear when the V itself decays. And by itself, that&#8217;s not enough information. Many of the proton-proton collisions at the LHC make a muon and anti-muon pair for a variety of random reasons. How, then, can one find evidence for the V, if its muon/anti-muon pair look just like other random processes that happen all the time?</p>

<p>One key trick is that the new particle&#8217;s muon/anti-muon pair isn&#8217;t random: the energies and momenta of the muon and anti-muon always have a very special relationship, characteristic of the rest mass of the V particle. <em>[Specifically: the &#8220;<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-invariant-mass/">invariant mass</a>&#8221; of the muon/anti-muon pair equals the V rest mass.]</em> And so, we use the fact that this special relationship rarely holds for the random background, but it always holds for the signal.Â  We don&#8217;t know the V mass, but we do know that the signal itself always reflects it.</p>
<p>The problem (both qualitatively and quantitatively) is much like trying to hear someone singing on your car radio while stuck in a deafening city traffic jam. As long as the note being sung is loud and clear enough, and the noise isn&#8217;t too insane, it&#8217;s possible.</p>
<p>But what if it&#8217;s not? Well, you might try some additional tricks. Noise reduction headphones, for example, would potentially cancel some of the traffic sound, making the song easier to hear. And that&#8217;s a vague analogy to what we are doing when we require the muon and anti-muon be from a fast particle. Most of the random processes that make muon/anti-muon pairs make a <em>slow pair</em>. [The individual muon and anti-muon move quickly, but together they look as though they came from something slow.] By removing those muon/anti-muon pairs that are slow, in this sense, we remove much of the random &#8220;background&#8221; while leaving much of the signal from any new particle of the sort we&#8217;re looking for.</p>
<p>Searches for particles like V have come mainly in two classes. Either (1) no noise-cancelling tricks are applied, and one just tries to cope with the full set of random muon/anti-muon pairs, or (2) a precise signal is sought in a highly targeted matter, and every trick one can think of is applied. Approach (1), extremely broad but shallow, has the advantage of being very simple, but the disadvantage that what you&#8217;re looking for might be lost in the noise. Approach (2), deep but narrow, has the advantage of being extremely powerful for the targeted signal, but the disadvantage that many other interesting signals are removed by one or another of the too-clever tricks.Â  So if you use the approach (2), you may need a different search strategy for each target.</p>
<p>Our approach tries to maintain tremendous breadth while adding some more depth. And the reason this is possible is that the trick of requiring substantial momentum can reduce the size of the background &#8220;noise&#8221; by factors of 5, 25, 100 &#8212; depending on how much momentum one demands. These are big factors! <em>[Which is important, because when you reduce background by 100, you usually only gain sensitivity to your signal by 10.]</em> So imposing this sort of requirement can make it somewhat easier to find signals from fast hidden particles.</p>
<p>Using this approach, we were able to search for fast hidden short-lived particles and exclude them <em><strong>without exception</strong></em> across a wide range of masses and down to smaller production rates than anyone has in the past. The precise bounds still need to be worked out in particular cases, but it&#8217;s clear that while, as expected, we do less well than targeted searches for particular signals, we often do 2 to 10 times better than a conventional broad search. And that benefit of our method over the conventional approach should apply also to ATLAS and CMS when they search in their full data sets.</p>
<p><a id="experts"></a><br />
<strong>Some Additional Technical Remarks for our Experimental Colleagues:</strong></p>
<p>Now, for my expert colleagues, some comments about our results and where one can take them next. I&#8217;ll reserve most of my thoughts on our use of open data, and why open data is valuable, for my next post&#8230; with one exception.</p>
<p><strong>Isolation Or Not</strong></p>
<p>Open data plays a central role in our analysis at the point where we drop the muon isolation criterion and replace it with something else.Â  We considered two ways of reducing QCD background (muons from heavy quark decays and fake muons);</p>
<ul>
<li>the usual one, requiring the muons and anti-muons be isolated from other particles,</li>
<li>dropping the isolation criterion on muons altogether, and replacing it with a cut on the promptness of the muon (i.e. on the impact parameter).</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>With real data to look at, we were able to establish that by tightening the promptness requirement alone, one can reduce QCD until it is comparable to the Drell-Yan background, with minimal loss of signal.</strong></em> And that means a price of no more than âˆš2 in sensitivity. So if chasing a potential signal whose muons are isolated &lt; 85% of the time (i.e. a dimuon isolation efficiency &lt; 70%) one may be better off dropping the isolation criterion and replacing it with a promptness criterion. [Of course there&#8217;s a great deal of in-between, such as demanding one fully isolated lepton and imposing promptness and loose isolation on the other.]</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to think of reasonable signals where each muon is isolated less than 85% of the time; indeed, as Kathryn Zurek and I emphasized back in 2006, a feature of many relevant hidden sector models (&#8220;hidden valleys&#8221; or &#8220;dark sectors&#8221;, as they are often known) is that particles emerge in clusters, creating non-standard jets. So it is quite common, in such theories, that the isolation criterion should be dropped (see for example <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0712.2041">this study from 2007</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>Our Limits</strong></p>
<p>Our main results are model-independent limits on the product of the cross-section for V production, the probability for V to decay to muons, and the acceptance and efficiency for the production of V.Â  To apply our limits, these quantities must be computed within a particular signal model. We&#8217;ve been working so hard to iron out our results that we really haven&#8217;t had time yet to look carefully at their detailed implications. But there are a few things already worth noting.</p>
<p>We briefly compared our model-independent results to targeted analyses by ATLAS and CMS for a simple model: Higgs decaying to two pseudoscalars <em><strong>a</strong></em>, one of which decays to a bottom quark/anti-quark pair and one to a muon/anti-muon pair. (More generally we considered <em>h<strong>â†’</strong></em>V<em><strong>a</strong></em> where V, decaying to muons, may have a different mass from <strong><em>a</em></strong>). If the V and <em><strong>a</strong></em> mass are both 40 GeV, our limits lag the targeted limits by a factor of 15-20.Â  But the targeted limits used 10-20 times as much data as we had.Â  One may then estimate that <strong><em>with identical data sets</em></strong>, the difference between our approach and theirs would likely be somewhere between 5 and 10.</p>
<p>Conversely, there are many models to which the targeted limits don&#8217;t apply; if <em><strong>a</strong></em> usually decays to gluons, or the <em><strong>a</strong></em> mass is so low that its decay products merge, we still set the same limit, while the published experimental analyses, which require two b-tagged jets, do not.</p>
<p>Thus broad analyses and deep analyses are complementary, and both are needed.</p>
<p><strong>The wiggle at 29.5 GeV and what to do about it</strong></p>
<p>In our limit plots, we have a few excesses, as one would expect with such a detailed mass scan. The only interesting excess (which is not the most significant) is found in a sample with no isolation criterion and a cut of 25 GeV on the dimuon pair &#8212; and what makes it interesting is that it is at 29.5 GeV (and locally 2.7Ïƒ) which is quite near to a couple of other curious excesses (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06536">from ALEPH data</a> andÂ <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01890">by CMS</a>) that we&#8217;ve heard about in the last couple of years.Â  Probably it&#8217;s nothing, but just in case, let me say a few cautious words about it.</p>

<p>So let&#8217;s imagine there were a new particle (I&#8217;ll keep calling it V) with mass of about 29 GeV.Â  What would we already know about it?</p>
<p>The excess we see at 29.5 GeV does not appear in the isolated sample, which overlaps the prompt sample but is half its size (see the figure above left), and it&#8217;s not visible with a transverse momentum cut of 60 GeV.Â  That means it could only be consistent with a signal with transverse momentum in the 25-50 GeV range, and with often-non-isolated leptons.</p>
<p>If it is produced with bottom (<em>b</em>) quarks all of the time, then there&#8217;s no question that CMS&#8217;s studies, which require a <em>b</em>-tagged jet, are much more sensitive than we are, and there&#8217;s no chance, if they have only a ~3Ïƒ excess, that we would see any hint of it.</p>
<p><em><strong>But if instead V is usually produced with <span style="color:#ff0000;">no</span> b quarks, then the CMS analysis could be missing most of the events.</strong> </em>We, in our model-independent analysis, would miss far fewer. And in that context, it&#8217;s possible we would see a hint in our analysis at the same time CMS sees a hint in theirs, despite having much less data available.</p>
<p>Moreover, since the muons must often be non-isolated (and as mentioned above, there are many models where this happens naturally) other searches that require isolated leptons (e.g. multilepton searches) might have less sensitivity than one might initially assume.</p>
<p>Were this true, then applying our analysis <em>[with little or no isolation requirement, and a promptness cut]</em> to the full Run II data set would immediately reveal this particle. Both ATLAS or CMS would see it easily.Â Â  So this is not a question we need to debate or discuss. There&#8217;s plenty of data; we just need to see the results of our methodology applied to it.</p>
<p>It would hardly be surprising if someone has looked already, in the past or present, by accident or by design.Â  Nevertheless, there will be considerable interest in seeing a public result.</p>
<p><strong>Looking Beyond This Analysis</strong></p>
<p>First, a few obvious points:</p>
<ul>
<li>We only used muons, but one could add electrons; for a spin-one V, this would help.</li>
<li>Our methods would also work for photon pairs (for which there&#8217;s more experience because of the Higgs, though not at low mass) as appropriate for spin-0 and spin-2 parent particles.</li>
<li>Although we applied our approach below the Z peak and above the upsilon, there&#8217;s no reason not to extend it above or below. We refrained only because we had too little data above the Z peak to do proper fits, and below the Upsilon the muons were so collimated that our results would have been affected by the losses in the dimuon trigger efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<p>More generally, the device of reducing backgrounds through a transverse momentum cut (or a transverse boost cut) is only one of several methods that are motivated by hidden sector models. As I have emphasized in many talks, <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/94815/contributions/1282671/">for instance here</a>, others include:</p>
<p>1) <strong>cutting on the number of jets</strong> [each additional jet reduces background by a factor of several, depending on the jet pt cut]. This works because Drell-Yan and even dileptonic top have few jets on average, and it works on QCD to a lesser extent. It is sensitive to models where the V is produced by a heavy particle (or particle pair) that typically produces many jets. Isolation is often reduced in this case, so a loose isolation criterion (or none) may be necessary. Of course one could also impose a cut on the <strong>number of b tags.</strong></p>
<p>2) <strong>cutting on the total transverse energy in the event</strong>, often called S_T. This works because in Drell-Yan, S_T is usually of the same order as the dimuon mass. It (probably) doesn&#8217;t remove much QCD unless the isolation criterion is applied, and there will still be plenty of top background. It&#8217;s best for models where the V is produced by a heavy particle (or particle pair) but the V momentum is often not high, the number of jets is rather small, and the events are rare.</p>
<p>3) <strong>cutting on the missing transverse energy in the event</strong>, which works because it&#8217;s small in Drell-Yan and QCD. This of course is done in many supersymmetry studies and elsewhere, but no model-independent limits on V production has been shown publicly.Â  This is a powerful probe of models where some hidden particles are very long-lived, or often decay invisibly.</p>
<p>All of these approaches can be applied to muon pairs, electron pairs, photon pairs &#8212; even tau pairs and bottom-jet pairs, for that matter.Â  Each of them can provide an advantage in reducing backgrounds and allowing more powerful model-independent searches for resonances. And in each case, there are signals that might have been missed in other analyses that could show up first in these searches.Â  More theoretical and experimental studies are needed, but in my opinion, many of these searches need to be done on Run II data before there can be any confidence that the floor has been swept clean.</p>
<p>[There is at least one more subtle example: <strong>cutting on the number of tracks</strong>. Talk to me about the relevant signals if you&#8217;re curious.]</p>
<p>Of course, <strong>multi-lepton searches</strong> are a powerful tool for finding V as well. All you need is one stray lepton &#8212; and then you plot the dimuon (or dielectron) mass. Unfortunately <em><strong>we rarely see limits on V + lepton as a function of the V mass, but it would be great if they were made available</strong></em>, because they would put much stronger constraints on relevant models than one can obtain by mere counting of 3-lepton events.</p>
<p><strong>A subtlety: The question of how to place cuts</strong></p>
<p>A last point for the diehards: one of the decisions that searches of this type require is where exactly to make the cuts &#8212; or alternatively, how to bin the data? Should our first cut on the transverse momentum be at 25 or 35 GeV? and having made this choice, where should the next cut be? Without a principle, this choice introduces significant arbitrariness into the search strategy, with associated problems.</p>
<p>This question is itself crude, and surely there are more sophisticated statistical methods for approaching the issue. There is also the question of whether to bin rather than cut. But I did want to point out that we proposed an answer, in the form of a rough principle, which one might call a &#8220;2-5&#8221; rule, illustrated in the figure below. The idea is that a signal at the 2 sigma level at one cut should be seen at the 5 sigma level after the next, stricter cut is applied; this requires each cut successively reduce the background by roughly a factor of (5/2)Â².Â  Implicitly, in this calculation we assume the stricter cut removes no signal. That assumption is less silly than it sounds, because the signals to which we are sensitive often have a characteristic momentum scale, and cuts below that characteristic scale have slowly varying acceptance.Â  We showed some examples of this in section V of our paper.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Sun is busy this summer. The upcoming eclipse on August 21 will turn day into deep twilight and transfix millions across the United States. Â But before we get there, we may, if we&#8217;re lucky, see darkness transformed into color and light.</p>
<p>On Friday July 14th, a giant sunspot in our Sun&#8217;s upper regions, easily visible if you project the Sun&#8217;s image onto a wall, generated a powerful flare. Â A solar flare is a sort of magnetically powered explosion; it produces powerful electromagnetic waves and often, as in this case, blows a large quantity of subatomic particles from the Sun&#8217;s corona. The latter is called a &#8220;coronal mass ejection.&#8221; It appears that the cloud of particles from Friday&#8217;s flare is large, and headed more or less straight for the Earth.</p>
<p>Light, visible and otherwise, is an electromagnetic wave, and so the electromagnetic waves generated in the flare &#8212; mostly ultraviolet light and X-rays &#8212; travel through space at the speed of light, arriving at the Earth in eight and a half minutes. They cause effects in the Earth&#8217;s upper atmosphere that can disrupt radio communications, or worse. Â That&#8217;s another story.</p>
<p>But the cloud of subatomic particles from the coronal mass ejection travels a few hundred times slower than light, and it takes it about two or three days to reach the Earth. Â The wait is on.</p>
<p>Bottom line: a huge number of high-energy subatomic particles may arrive in the next 24 to 48 hours. If and when they do, the electrically charged particles among them will be trapped in, and shepherded by, the Earth&#8217;s magnetic field, which will drive them spiraling into the atmosphere close to the Earth&#8217;s polar regions. And when they hit the atmosphere, they&#8217;ll strike atoms of nitrogen and oxygen, which in turn will glow. Aurora Borealis, Northern Lights.</p>
<p>So if you live in the upper northern hemisphere, including Europe, Canada and much of the United States, keep your eyes turned to the north (and to the south if you&#8217;re in Australia or southern South America) over the next couple of nights. Dark skies may be crucial; the glow may be very faint.</p>
<p>You can also keep abreast of the situation, as I will, using NOAA data, available for instance at</p>
<p><a href="http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/communities/space-weather-enthusiasts">http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/communities/space-weather-enthusiasts</a></p>
<p>The plot on the upper left of that website, an example of which is reproduced below, shows three types of data. The top graph shows the amount of X-rays impacting the atmosphere; the big jump on the 14th is Friday&#8217;s flare. And if and when the Earth&#8217;s magnetic field goes nuts and auroras begin, the bottom plot will show the so-called &#8220;Kp Index&#8221; climbing to 5, 6, or hopefully 7 or 8. When the index gets that high, there&#8217;s a much greater chance of seeing auroras much further away from the poles than usual.</p>

<p>Keep an eye also on the data from the ACE satellite, lower down on the website; it&#8217;s placed to give Earth an early warning, so when its data gets busy, you&#8217;ll know the cloud of particles is not far away.</p>
<p>Wishing you all a great sky show!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t know what all the fuss is about &#8220;alternative facts.&#8221; Why, we scientists use them all the time!</p>
<p>For example, because of my political views, I teach physics students that gravity pulls down. That&#8217;s why the students I teach, when they go on to be engineers, put wheels on the bottom corners of cars, so that the cars don&#8217;t scrape on the ground. But in some countries, the physicists teach them that gravity pulls whichever way the country&#8217;s leaders instruct it to. That&#8217;s why their engineers build flying carpets as transports for their country&#8217;s troops. It&#8217;s a much more effective way to bring an army into battle, if your politicsÂ allows it. Â We ought to consider it here.</p>
<p>Another example: in my physics class I claimÂ that energy is &#8220;conserved&#8221; (in the physics sense) &#8212; it is never created out of nothing, nor is it ever destroyed. In our daily lives, energy is taken in with food, converted into special biochemicals for storage, and then used to keep us warm, maintain the pumping of our hearts, allow us to think, walk, breathe &#8212; everything we do. Those are my facts. But in some countries, the facts and laws are different, and energy can be created from nothing. The citizens of those countries never need to eat; it is a wonderful thing to be freed from this requirement. It&#8217;s great for their military, too, to not have to supply food for troops, or fuel for tanks and airplanes and ships. Our only protection against invasion from these countries is that if they crossed our borders they&#8217;d suddenly need fuel tanks.</p>
<p>Facts are what you make them; it&#8217;s entirely up to you. You need a good, well-thought-out system of facts, of course; otherwise they won&#8217;t produce the answers that you want. But just first figure out what you want to be true, and then go out and find the facts that make it true. That&#8217;s the way science has always been done, and the best scientists all insist upon this strategy. Â As a simple illustration, compare the photos below. Â Which picture has more people in it? Â  Obviously, the answer depends on what facts you&#8217;ve chosen to use. Â  [Picture copyright Reuters] Â If you can&#8217;t understand that, you&#8217;re not ready to be a serious scientist!</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d44bf9ac740cfa2e4c015e985cf20e4ec8d6fdc9/r=540/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove3/29906170001/201701/2306/29906170001_5290953783001_5290938262001-vs.jpg" /></p>
<p>A third example: when I teach physics to students, I instill in them the notion that quantum mechanics controls the atomic world, and underlies the transistors in every computer and every cell phone. But the uncertainty principle that arises in quantum mechanics just isn&#8217;t acceptable in some countries, so they don&#8217;t factualize it. They don&#8217;t use seditious and immoral computer chips there; instead they use proper vacuum tubes. One curious result is that their computers are the size of buildings. The CDC advises you not to travel to these countries, and certainly not to take electronics with you. Not only might your cell phone explode when it gets there, you yourself might too, since your own molecules are held together with quantum mechanical glue. At least you should bring a good-sized bottle of our local facts with you on your travels, and take a good handful before bedtime.</p>
<p>Hearing all the naive cries that facts aren&#8217;t for the choosing,Â I became curious about what our schools areÂ teaching young people. So I asked a friend&#8217;s son, a bright young kid in fourth grade, what he&#8217;d been learning about alternatives and science. Do you know what he answered?! Â I was shocked. &#8220;Alternative facts?&#8221;, he said. &#8220;You mean <strong>lies</strong>?&#8221; Sheesh. Kids these days&#8230; What are we teaching them? It&#8217;s a good thing we&#8217;ll soon have a new secretary of education.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>UPDATE 10/26: In the original version of this post, I stupidly forgot to include an effect, causing an error of a factor of about 5 in one of myÂ estimates below. I had originally suggested that a recent result using ALEPH data was probably more powerful than a recent CMS result. Â But once the error is corrected, the two experiments appear have comparable sensitivity. However, I was very conservative in my analysis of ALEPH, and my guess concerning CMS has a big uncertainty band &#8212; so it might go either way. Â It&#8217;s up to ALEPH experts and CMS experts to show us who really wins the day. Â Added reasoning and discussion marked in green below.</strong></span></p>
<p>In <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2016/10/21/hiding-from-a-nightmare/">Friday&#8217;s post</a>, I highlighted the importance of looking for low-mass particles whose interactions with known particles are very weak. I referred to a recent preprint in which an experimental physicist, Dr. Arno Heister, reanalyzed ALEPH data in such a search.</p>
<p>AÂ few hours later, Harvard Professor Matt Reece pointed meÂ to a paper thatÂ appeared <strong>just two weeks ago:</strong> a very interestingÂ <a href="http://cms-results.web.cern.ch/cms-results/public-results/preliminary-results/HIG-15-009/index.html">CMS analysis of 2011-2012 data that did a search of this type</a> &#8212; although it appears that CMS <em>[one of the two general purpose detectors at the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">Large Hadron Collider</a> (LHC)]</em> didn&#8217;t think of it that way.</p>
<p>The title of the paper is obscure: Â &#8220;<em>Search for a light pseudoâ€“scalar Higgs boson produced inÂ association with bottom quarks in pp collisions at 8 TeV</em>&#8220;. Â Such spin-zero &#8220;pseudo-scalar&#8221; particles, which often arise in speculative models with more than one Higgs particle, usually decay to bottom quark/anti-quark pairs or tau/anti-tau pairs. Â But they can have a <strong>very rare</strong> decay to muon/anti-muon, which is much easier to measure. The title of the paper gives no indication that the muon/anti-muon channel is the target of the search; you have to read the abstract. Shouldn&#8217;t the wordsÂ &#8220;in the dimuon channel&#8221; or &#8220;dimuon resonance&#8221; appear in the title? Â That would help researchers who are interested in dimuons, but not in pseudo-scalars, find the paper.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the main result of the paper:</p>
<p><a href="http://cms-results.web.cern.ch/cms-results/public-results/preliminary-results/HIG-15-009/CMS-PAS-HIG-15-009_Figure_005.png"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/cms-results.web.cern.ch/cms-results/public-results/preliminary-results/HIG-15-009/CMS-PAS-HIG-15-009_Figure_005.png" style="max-width:100%;" /></a></p>
<p>At left is shown a plot of the number of events as a function of the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-invariant-mass/">invariant mass</a> of the muon/anti-muon pairs. Â CMS data is in black dots; estimatedÂ background is shown in the upper curve (with top quark backgrounds in the lower curve); and the peak at bottom shows what aÂ simulated particle decaying to muon/anti-muon with a mass of 30 GeV/cÂ² would look like. (Imagine sticking the peak on top of the upper curve to see how a signal wouldÂ affect the data points). Â At right are the resulting limits on the rate for such a resonance to be produced and then decay to muon/anti-muon,Â <em><strong>if it is radiated off of a bottom quark. [</strong></em><em>A limit of 100 femtobarns means that at most two thousand collisions of this type could have occurred during the year 2012. Â But note that only about 1 in 100 of these collisions would have been observed, due to the difficulty of <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/the-trigger-discarding-all-but-the-gold/">triggering on these collisions</a> and some other challenges.]</em></p>
<p><em>[NoteÂ alsoÂ the restriction of the mass of the dimuon pair to the range 25 GeV to 60 GeV. This may have done purely been for technical reasons, but if it was due to the theoretical assumptions, that restriction should be lifted.]</em></p>
<p>While this plot places moderate limits on <strong>spin-zero</strong> particles produced with a bottom quark, it&#8217;s equallyÂ interesting, at least to me, in other contexts. Specifically, it puts limits on any light <strong>spin-one</strong> particle (call it V) that mixes (either via kinetic or mass mixing) with the photon and Z and often comes along with at least one bottom quark&#8230; because <strong>for such particles the rate to decay to muons is <span style="color:#ff0000;">not</span> rare</strong>. Â This is very interesting for hidden valley models specifically; as I mentioned on Friday, new spin-one and spin-zero particles often are produced together, giving aÂ muon/anti-muon pair along with one or more bottom quark/anti-quark pairs.</p>
<p>But CMS interpreted its measurement only in terms of <strong><em>radiation of aÂ new particle off a bottom quar</em>k</strong>. Â Now, what if a V particle decaying sometimes to muon/anti-muon were produced in a <strong>Z particle decay</strong>Â <span style="color:#999999;"><em>(a possibility alluded to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0604261">already in 2006</a>).</em></span>Â  For a different production process, the angles and energies of the particles would be different, and since many events would be lost (due to triggering, transverse momentum cuts, and b-tagging inefficiencies at low transverse momentum) the limits would have to be fully recalculated by the experimenters. Â It would be great if CMS could add such an analysis before they publish this paper.</p>
<p>Still, we can make a rough back-of-the-envelope estimate, with big caveats. The LHCÂ produced about 600 million ZÂ particles at CMS in 2012. The plot at right tells us that if the V were radiated off a bottom quark, the maximum number of producedÂ V&#8217;s decaying to muons would be about 2000 to 8000, depending on the V mass. Â Now if we could take those numbers directly, we&#8217;d conclude that the fraction of Z&#8217;s that could decay to muon/anti-muon plus bottom quarks in this way would be 3 to 12 per million.Â ButÂ sensitivity of this search to a Z decay to V is probably much less than for a V radiated off bottom quarks <em>[because (depending on the V mass) either the bottom quarks in the Z decay would beÂ less energetic and more difficult to tag, or the muons are less energetic on average, or both.]</em> So I&#8217;m guessing that the limits on Z decays to V are always worse than one perÂ hundred thousand, for any V mass. Â <em>(Thanks to Wei Xue for catching an error as I was finalizing myÂ estimate.) Â </em></p>
<p>If that guess/estimate is correct, thenÂ the CMS search <strong>does not</strong> rule out the possibility of a hundred or so Z decays to V particles at each of the various LEP experiments. Â That said, old LEP searches might rule this possibility out; if anyone knows of such a search, please comment or contact me.</p>
<p>As for whether Heister&#8217;s analysis of the ALEPH experiment&#8217;s data shows signs of such a signal, I think it unlikely (though some people seemed to read my post as saying the opposite.)Â  <strong>As I pointed outÂ in Friday&#8217;s post</strong>, not only is the excess too small for excitement on its own, it also is somewhat too wide and its angular correlations look like the background <em>(which comes, of course, from bottom quarks that decay to charm quarks plus a muon and neutrino.)</em> Â The point of Friday&#8217;s post, and of today&#8217;s, is that <strong>we should be looking</strong>.</p>
<p>In fact, because of Heister&#8217;s work <em>(which, by the way, is his own, not endorsed by the ALEPH collaboration)</em>, we can draw interesting if rough conclusions. Â Ignore for now the bump at 30 GeV/cÂ²; that&#8217;s more controversial. Â What aboutÂ theÂ <strong>absence</strong> of aÂ bump between 35 and 50 GeV/cÂ²? Unless there are subtleties with his analysis that I don&#8217;t understand, we learn that at ALEPH there were fewer thanÂ ten Z decays to a V particle (plus a source of bottom quarks) for V in this mass range. Â <del>That limits such Z decays to aboutÂ 2 to 3Â per million.</del>Â  <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>OOPS: Dumb mistake!! At this step, I forgot to include the fact that requiring bottom quarks in the ALEPH events only works about 20% of the time <em>(thanks to Imperial College Professor Oliver Buchmuller for questioning my reasoning!)</em>Â The real number is therefore about 5 times larger, more like 10 to 15 per million.</strong></span> If that rough estimate is correct, it would provide a <del>more powerful constraint than</del>Â <span style="color:#008000;">constraint roughly comparable to</span> the current CMS analysis.</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;"><em>[[BUT: In my original argument I was very conservative. Â When I said &#8220;fewer than 10&#8221;, I was trying to be brief; really, looking at the invariant mass plot, the allowed numbers of excess events for a V with mass above 36 GeV is typically fewer than 7 or even 5. Â And that doesn&#8217;t include any angular information, which for many signals would reduce the numbers to 3. Â  Including these effects properlyÂ brings the ALEPH bound back down to something close to my initial estimate. Â Anyway, it&#8217;s clear that CMS is nipping at ALEPH&#8217;s heels, but I&#8217;m still betting they haven&#8217;t passed ALEPH &#8212; yet.]]</em></span></p>
<p>So my advice would be to setÂ Heister&#8217;s bump asideÂ and insteadÂ <strong>focus on the constraints that one can obtain, and the potential discoveries that one <span style="color:#ff0000;">could</span> make, with this type of analysis, either at LEP or at LHC.</strong>Â That&#8217;s where I think the real lesson lies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Results for <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2015/12/18/so-what-is-it/">the bump seen in December</a> have been updated, and indeed, with the new 2016 data &#8212; four times as much as was obtained in 2015 &#8212; neither ATLAS nor CMS [the two general purpose detectors at the Large Hadron Collider] sees an excess where the bump appeared in 2015. Not even a hint, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2016/08/04/a-flash-in-the-pan-flickers-out/">as we already learned inadvertently from CMS yesterday</a>.</p>
<p>All indications so far are that the bump was a garden-variety statistical fluke, probably <em>(my personal guess! there&#8217;s no evidence!)</em> enhanced slightly by minor imperfections in the 2015 measurements. Should we be surprised? No. If you look back at the history of the 1970s and 1980s, or at the recent past, you&#8217;ll see that it&#8217;s quite common for hints &#8212; even strong hints &#8212; of new phenomena to disappear with more data. This is especially true for hints based on small amounts of data (and there were not many two photon events in the bump &#8212; just a couple of dozen). Â There&#8217;s a reason why particle physicists have very high standards for statistical significance before they believe they&#8217;ve seen something real. Â <em>(Many other fields, notablyÂ medical research, have much lower standards. Â Think about that for a while.)</em> Â History has useful lessons, if you&#8217;re willing to learn them.</p>
<p>Back in December 2011, a lot of physicists were persuadedÂ that the data shown by ATLAS and CMS was convincing evidence that the Higgs particle had been discovered. It turned out the data was indeed showing the first hint of the Higgs. But their confidence in what the data was telling them at the time &#8212; what was called &#8220;firm evidence&#8221; by some &#8212; was dead wrong. I took a lot of flack for <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/holiday-higgs-hints-confidence-inspiring-or-not/">viewing that evidence</a> as a 50-50 proposition (70-30 <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/05/04/search-workshop-panel-discussion-on-lhc-posted-online/">by March 2012</a>, after more evidence was presented). Yet the December 2015 (<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2016/03/18/the-diphoton-excess-improves-a-bit/">March 2016</a>) evidence for the bump at 750 GeV was comparable to what we had in December 2011 for the Higgs. Where&#8217;d it go? Â Clearly such a level of evidence is not so firm as people claimed. I, at least, would not have been surprised if that original Higgs hint had vanished, just as I am not surprised now&#8230; though disappointed of course.</p>
<p>Was this all much ado about nothing? I don&#8217;t think so. There&#8217;s a reason to have fire drills, to run live-fire exercises, to test out emergency management procedures. A lot of new ideas, both in terms of new theories of nature and new approaches to making experimental measurements, were generated by thinking about this bump in the night. The hope for a quick 2016 discoveryÂ may be gone, but what we learned will stick around, and make us better at what we do.</p>
