										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>UPDATE 10/26: In the original version of this post, I stupidly forgot to include an effect, causing an error of a factor of about 5 in one of my estimates below. I had originally suggested that a recent result using ALEPH data was probably more powerful than a recent CMS result.  But once the error is corrected, the two experiments appear have comparable sensitivity. However, I was very conservative in my analysis of ALEPH, and my guess concerning CMS has a big uncertainty band &#8212; so it might go either way.  It&#8217;s up to ALEPH experts and CMS experts to show us who really wins the day.  Added reasoning and discussion marked in green below.</strong></span></p>
<p>In <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2016/10/21/hiding-from-a-nightmare/">Friday&#8217;s post</a>, I highlighted the importance of looking for low-mass particles whose interactions with known particles are very weak. I referred to a recent preprint in which an experimental physicist, Dr. Arno Heister, reanalyzed ALEPH data in such a search.</p>
<p>A few hours later, Harvard Professor Matt Reece pointed me to a paper that appeared <strong>just two weeks ago:</strong> a very interesting <a href="http://cms-results.web.cern.ch/cms-results/public-results/preliminary-results/HIG-15-009/index.html">CMS analysis of 2011-2012 data that did a search of this type</a> &#8212; although it appears that CMS <em>[one of the two general purpose detectors at the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">Large Hadron Collider</a> (LHC)]</em> didn&#8217;t think of it that way.</p>
<p>The title of the paper is obscure:  &#8220;<em>Search for a light pseudo–scalar Higgs boson produced in association with bottom quarks in pp collisions at 8 TeV</em>&#8220;.  Such spin-zero &#8220;pseudo-scalar&#8221; particles, which often arise in speculative models with more than one Higgs particle, usually decay to bottom quark/anti-quark pairs or tau/anti-tau pairs.  But they can have a <strong>very rare</strong> decay to muon/anti-muon, which is much easier to measure. The title of the paper gives no indication that the muon/anti-muon channel is the target of the search; you have to read the abstract. Shouldn&#8217;t the words &#8220;in the dimuon channel&#8221; or &#8220;dimuon resonance&#8221; appear in the title?  That would help researchers who are interested in dimuons, but not in pseudo-scalars, find the paper.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the main result of the paper:</p>
<p><a href="http://cms-results.web.cern.ch/cms-results/public-results/preliminary-results/HIG-15-009/CMS-PAS-HIG-15-009_Figure_005.png"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/cms-results.web.cern.ch/cms-results/public-results/preliminary-results/HIG-15-009/CMS-PAS-HIG-15-009_Figure_005.png" style="max-width:100%;" /></a></p>
<p>At left is shown a plot of the number of events as a function of the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-invariant-mass/">invariant mass</a> of the muon/anti-muon pairs.  CMS data is in black dots; estimated background is shown in the upper curve (with top quark backgrounds in the lower curve); and the peak at bottom shows what a simulated particle decaying to muon/anti-muon with a mass of 30 GeV/c² would look like. (Imagine sticking the peak on top of the upper curve to see how a signal would affect the data points).  At right are the resulting limits on the rate for such a resonance to be produced and then decay to muon/anti-muon, <em><strong>if it is radiated off of a bottom quark. [</strong></em><em>A limit of 100 femtobarns means that at most two thousand collisions of this type could have occurred during the year 2012.  But note that only about 1 in 100 of these collisions would have been observed, due to the difficulty of <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/the-trigger-discarding-all-but-the-gold/">triggering on these collisions</a> and some other challenges.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Note also the restriction of the mass of the dimuon pair to the range 25 GeV to 60 GeV. This may have done purely been for technical reasons, but if it was due to the theoretical assumptions, that restriction should be lifted.]</em></p>
<p>While this plot places moderate limits on <strong>spin-zero</strong> particles produced with a bottom quark, it&#8217;s equally interesting, at least to me, in other contexts. Specifically, it puts limits on any light <strong>spin-one</strong> particle (call it V) that mixes (either via kinetic or mass mixing) with the photon and Z and often comes along with at least one bottom quark&#8230; because <strong>for such particles the rate to decay to muons is <span style="color:#ff0000;">not</span> rare</strong>.  This is very interesting for hidden valley models specifically; as I mentioned on Friday, new spin-one and spin-zero particles often are produced together, giving a muon/anti-muon pair along with one or more bottom quark/anti-quark pairs.</p>
<p>But CMS interpreted its measurement only in terms of <strong><em>radiation of a new particle off a bottom quar</em>k</strong>.  Now, what if a V particle decaying sometimes to muon/anti-muon were produced in a <strong>Z particle decay</strong> <span style="color:#999999;"><em>(a possibility alluded to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0604261">already in 2006</a>).</em></span>  For a different production process, the angles and energies of the particles would be different, and since many events would be lost (due to triggering, transverse momentum cuts, and b-tagging inefficiencies at low transverse momentum) the limits would have to be fully recalculated by the experimenters.  It would be great if CMS could add such an analysis before they publish this paper.</p>
<p>Still, we can make a rough back-of-the-envelope estimate, with big caveats. The LHC produced about 600 million Z particles at CMS in 2012. The plot at right tells us that if the V were radiated off a bottom quark, the maximum number of produced V&#8217;s decaying to muons would be about 2000 to 8000, depending on the V mass.  Now if we could take those numbers directly, we&#8217;d conclude that the fraction of Z&#8217;s that could decay to muon/anti-muon plus bottom quarks in this way would be 3 to 12 per million. But sensitivity of this search to a Z decay to V is probably much less than for a V radiated off bottom quarks <em>[because (depending on the V mass) either the bottom quarks in the Z decay would be less energetic and more difficult to tag, or the muons are less energetic on average, or both.]</em> So I&#8217;m guessing that the limits on Z decays to V are always worse than one per hundred thousand, for any V mass.  <em>(Thanks to Wei Xue for catching an error as I was finalizing my estimate.)  </em></p>
<p>If that guess/estimate is correct, then the CMS search <strong>does not</strong> rule out the possibility of a hundred or so Z decays to V particles at each of the various LEP experiments.  That said, old LEP searches might rule this possibility out; if anyone knows of such a search, please comment or contact me.</p>
<p>As for whether Heister&#8217;s analysis of the ALEPH experiment&#8217;s data shows signs of such a signal, I think it unlikely (though some people seemed to read my post as saying the opposite.)  <strong>As I pointed out in Friday&#8217;s post</strong>, not only is the excess too small for excitement on its own, it also is somewhat too wide and its angular correlations look like the background <em>(which comes, of course, from bottom quarks that decay to charm quarks plus a muon and neutrino.)</em>  The point of Friday&#8217;s post, and of today&#8217;s, is that <strong>we should be looking</strong>.</p>
<p>In fact, because of Heister&#8217;s work <em>(which, by the way, is his own, not endorsed by the ALEPH collaboration)</em>, we can draw interesting if rough conclusions.  Ignore for now the bump at 30 GeV/c²; that&#8217;s more controversial.  What about the <strong>absence</strong> of a bump between 35 and 50 GeV/c²? Unless there are subtleties with his analysis that I don&#8217;t understand, we learn that at ALEPH there were fewer than ten Z decays to a V particle (plus a source of bottom quarks) for V in this mass range.  <del>That limits such Z decays to about 2 to 3 per million.</del>  <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>OOPS: Dumb mistake!! At this step, I forgot to include the fact that requiring bottom quarks in the ALEPH events only works about 20% of the time <em>(thanks to Imperial College Professor Oliver Buchmuller for questioning my reasoning!)</em> The real number is therefore about 5 times larger, more like 10 to 15 per million.</strong></span> If that rough estimate is correct, it would provide a <del>more powerful constraint than</del> <span style="color:#008000;">constraint roughly comparable to</span> the current CMS analysis.</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;"><em>[[BUT: In my original argument I was very conservative.  When I said &#8220;fewer than 10&#8221;, I was trying to be brief; really, looking at the invariant mass plot, the allowed numbers of excess events for a V with mass above 36 GeV is typically fewer than 7 or even 5.  And that doesn&#8217;t include any angular information, which for many signals would reduce the numbers to 3.   Including these effects properly brings the ALEPH bound back down to something close to my initial estimate.  Anyway, it&#8217;s clear that CMS is nipping at ALEPH&#8217;s heels, but I&#8217;m still betting they haven&#8217;t passed ALEPH &#8212; yet.]]</em></span></p>
<p>So my advice would be to set Heister&#8217;s bump aside and instead <strong>focus on the constraints that one can obtain, and the potential discoveries that one <span style="color:#ff0000;">could</span> make, with this type of analysis, either at LEP or at LHC.</strong> That&#8217;s where I think the real lesson lies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This summer there was a blog post from <span class="fn"><a class="g-profile" title="author profile" href="https://plus.google.com/111136225362929878171" rel="author">Sabine Hossenfelder</a></span>  claiming that &#8220;<a href="http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2016/08/the-lhc-nightmare-scenario-has-come-true.html">The LHC `nightmare scenario&#8217; has come true</a>&#8221; &#8212; implying that the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC] has found nothing but a <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/">Standard Model Higgs particle</a> (the simplest possible type), and will find nothing more of great importance. With all due respect for the considerable intelligence and technical ability of the author of that post, I could not disagree more; not only are we not in a nightmare, it isn&#8217;t even night-time yet, and hardly time for sleep or even daydreaming. There&#8217;s a tremendous amount of work to do, and there may be many hidden discoveries yet to be made, lurking in existing LHC data.  Or elsewhere.</p>
<p>I can defend this claim (and have done so as recently as this month; here are <a href="https://indico.bnl.gov/getFile.py/access?contribId=19&amp;sessionId=6&amp;resId=0&amp;materialId=slides&amp;confId=1516">my slides</a>). But there&#8217;s evidence from another quarter that it is far too early for such pessimism.  It has appeared in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06536">a new paper</a> (a preprint, so not yet peer-reviewed) by an experimentalist named Arno Heister, who is evaluating 20-year old data from the experiment known as <a href="https://home.cern/about/experiments/aleph">ALEPH</a>.</p>
<p>In the early 1990s the Large Electron-Positron (LEP) collider at CERN, in the same tunnel that now houses the LHC, produced nearly 4 million Z particles at the center of ALEPH; the Z&#8217;s decayed immediately into other particles, and ALEPH was used to observe those decays.  Of course the data was studied in great detail, and you might think there couldn&#8217;t possibly be anything still left to find in that data, after over 20 years. But a hidden gem wouldn&#8217;t surprise those of us who have worked in this subject for a long time &#8212; especially those of us who have worked on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0604261">hidden valleys</a>. <em>(Hidden Valleys are theories with a set of new forces and low-mass particles, which, because they aren&#8217;t affected by the known forces excepting gravity, interact very weakly with the known particles.  They are also often called &#8220;dark sectors&#8221; if they have something to do with dark matter.)</em></p>
<p>For some reason most experimenters in particle physics don&#8217;t tend to look for things just because they can; they stick to signals that theorists have already predicted. Since hidden valleys only hit the market in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0604261">a 2006 paper I wrote with then-student Kathryn Zurek</a>, long after the experimenters at ALEPH had moved on to other experiments, nobody went back to look in ALEPH or other LEP data for hidden valley phenomena (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1003.0705">with one exception</a>.) I didn&#8217;t expect anyone to ever do so; it&#8217;s a lot of work to dig up and recommission old computer files.</p>
<p>This wouldn&#8217;t have been a problem if the big LHC experiments (ATLAS, CMS and LHCb) had looked extensively for the sorts of particles expected in hidden valleys. ATLAS and CMS especially have many advantages; for instance, the LHC has made over a hundred times more Z particles than LEP ever did. But despite specific proposals for what to look for (and <a href="http://indico.cern.ch/event/46250/">a decade of pleading</a>), only a few limited searches have been carried out, mostly for very long-lived particles, for particles with mass of a few GeV/c² or less, and for particles produced in unexpected Higgs decays. And that means that, yes, hidden physics could certainly still be found in old ALEPH data, and in other old experiments. Kudos to Dr. Heister for taking a look.<span id="more-8706"></span></p>
<p>Now, has he actually <strong>found</strong> something hidden at ALEPH? It&#8217;s far too early to say. Dr. Heister is careful not to make a strong claim: his paper refers to an observed excess, not to the discovery of or even evidence for anything. But his analysis can be interpreted as showing a hint of a new particle (let&#8217;s call it the <strong>V particle</strong>, just to have a name for it) decaying sometimes to a muon and an anti-muon, and probably also sometimes to an electron and an anti-electron, with a rest mass about 1/3 of that of the Z particle &#8212; about 30 <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/">GeV</a>/c². Here&#8217;s one of the plots from his paper, showing the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-invariant-mass/">invariant mass</a> of the muon and anti-muon in Z decays that also have evidence of a bottom quark and a bottom anti-quark (each one giving a <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/jets-the-manifestation-of-quarks-and-gluons/">jet of hadrons</a> that has been &#8220;<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/jets-the-manifestation-of-quarks-and-gluons/b-tagging-identifying-jets-from-bottom-quarks/">b-tagged</a>&#8221;).  There&#8217;s an excess at about 30 GeV.</p>

<p>The simplest physical effect that would produce such a bump is a new particle; indeed this is how the Z particle itself was identified, over three decades ago.</p>
<p>However, the statistical significance of the bump is still only (after <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/08/28/nature-is-full-of-surprises/">look-elsewhere effect</a>) at most 3 standard deviations, according to the paper. So this bump could just be a fluke; we&#8217;ve seen similar ones disappear with more data, for example <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/04/20/dark-matter-now-you-see-it-now-you-dont/">this one</a>. There are also a couple of serious issues that will give experts pause <em>(the width of the bump is surprisingly large; the angular correlations seem consistent with background rather than a new signal; etc.)</em> So the data itself is not enough to convince anyone, including Dr. Heister, though it is certainly interesting.</p>
<p>Conversely it is intriguing that the bump in the plot above is observed in events with bottom quarks. It is common for hidden valleys <em>(including everything from a simple abelian Higgs models to more complex confining models)</em> to contain</p>
<ul>
<li>at least one spin-one particle V (which can decay to muon/anti-muon or electron/positron) and</li>
<li>at least one spin-zero particle S (which can decay to bottom/anti-bottom preferentially, with occasional decays to tau/anti-tau.)</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, in such models, a rare decay such as Z  ⇒ V + S, producing a muon/anti-muon pair plus two bottom quark/anti-quark <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/jets-the-manifestation-of-quarks-and-gluons/">jets</a>, would often be a possibility.*</p>
<p>*<span style="color:#808080;"><em>[In this case the bottom and anti-bottom jets would themselves show a peak in their invariant mass, but unfortunately their distribution in the presence of a candidate V was not shown. One other obvious prediction of such a model is a handful of striking Z ⇒ V + S ⇒ muon/anti-muon + tau/anti-tau events; but the expected number is very small and somewhat model-dependent.]</em></span></p>
<p>Another possibility (also common in hidden valleys) is that the bottom-tagged jets aren&#8217;t actually from real bottom quarks, and are instead fake bottom jets generated by one or two new long-lived hidden valley particles.</p>
<p>But clearly, before anyone gets excited, far more evidence is required. We&#8217;ll need to see similar studies done at one or more of the three other experiments that ran concurrently with ALEPH &#8212; L3, OPAL, and DELPHI. And of course ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb will surely take a look in their own data; for instance, ATLAS and CMS could search for a dilepton resonance in events with at least two bottom-tagged jets, where the whole system of bottom-tagged jets and dileptons has a invariant mass not greater than about 100 GeV/c². <em><span style="color:#ff0000;">[[IMPORTANT NOTE ADDED: It has been pointed out to me (thanks Matt Reece) that there was <a href="http://cds.cern.ch/record/2223864?ln=en">a relevant CMS search</a> from 2015 that had somehow entirely escaped my attention, in which <strong>one</strong> b-tag was required and a di-muon bump was sought between 25 and 60 GeV.  Although not aimed at hidden valleys, it provides one of the few constraints upon them in this mass range.  And at first glance, it seems to disfavor any signal large enough to explain the ALEPH excess.  But there might be subtleties, so let me not draw firm conclusions yet.]]</span></em> They should also look for the V particle in other ways &#8212; perhaps following the methods I&#8217;ve suggested repeatedly (see for example pages 40-45 of <a href="http://indico.cern.ch/event/46250/attachments/950108/1348060/Strassler.LPC1.pdf">this 2008 talk</a>) &#8212; since the V might not only appear in Z particle decays. <em>[That is: look for boosted V&#8217;s; look for V&#8217;s in high-energy events or high missing-energy events; look for V&#8217;s in events with many jets, possibly with bottom-tags; etc.]</em> In any case, if anything like the V particle really exists, several (and perhaps all) of the experiments should see some evidence for it, and in more than just a single context.</p>
<p>Though we should be skeptical that today&#8217;s paper on ALEPH data is the first step toward a major discovery, at minimum it is important for what it indirectly confirms: that searches at the LHC are far from complete, and that discoveries might lie hidden, for example in rare Z decays (and in rare decays of other particles, such as the top quark.) Neither ATLAS, CMS nor LHCb have ever done a search for rare but spectacular Z particle decays, but they certainly could, as they recently did for the Higgs particle; and if Heister&#8217;s excess turns out to be a real signal, they will be seen to have missed a huge opportunity.  So I hope that Heister&#8217;s paper, at a minimum, will encourage the LHC experiments to undertake a broader and more comprehensive program of searches for low-mass particles with very weak interactions.  Otherwise, my own nightmare, in which the diamonds hidden in the rough might remain undetected &#8212; perhaps for decades &#8212; might come true.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In <a title="A 100 TeV Proton-Proton Collider?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/03/a-100-tev-proton-proton-collider/">my last post</a>, I expressed the view that a particle accelerator with <a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/" target="_blank">proton</a>-proton collisions of (roughly) 100 <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/" target="_blank">TeV</a> of energy, significantly more powerful than the currently operational <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC] that helped scientists <a title="Discovery of the Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-discovery-of-the-higgs/" target="_blank">discover</a> the <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">Higgs particle</a>, is an obvious and important next steps in our process of learning about the elementary workings of nature. And I described how we don&#8217;t yet know whether it will be an exploratory machine or a machine with a clear scientific target; it will depend on what the LHC does or does not discover over the coming few years.</p>
<p>What will it mean, for the 100 TeV collider project and more generally, if the LHC, having made possible the discovery of the Higgs particle, provides us with no more clues?  Specifically, over the next few years, hundreds of tests of the Standard Model (the equations that govern <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the known particles and forces</a>) will be carried out in measurements made by the ATLAS, CMS and LHCb experiments at the LHC. Suppose that, as it has so far, the Standard Model passes every test that the experiments carry out? In particular, suppose the Higgs particle discovered in 2012 appears, after a few more years of intensive study, to be, as far the LHC can reveal, a <a title="The Standard Model Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/" target="_blank">Standard Model Higgs</a> &#8212; the simplest possible type of Higgs particle?</p>
<p>Before we go any further, let&#8217;s keep in mind that we already know that the Standard Model isn&#8217;t all there is to nature. The Standard Model does not provide a consistent theory of gravity, nor does it explain <a title="Neutrinos" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/" target="_blank">neutrino</a> masses, <a title="Questions and Answers About Dark Matter post-LUX" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/31/questions-and-answers-about-dark-matter-post-lux/" target="_blank">dark matter</a> or &#8220;dark energy&#8221; (also known as <a title="Why You Can’t Easily Dismiss the Cosmological Constant Problem" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/08/30/why-you-cant-easily-dismiss-the-cosmological-constant-problem/" target="_blank">the cosmological constant</a>). Moreover, many of its features are just things we have to accept without explanation, such as the strengths of the forces, the existence of &#8220;three generations&#8221; (i.e., that <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">there are two heavier cousins of the electron, two for the up quark and two for the down quark</a>), the values of the masses of the various particles, etc. However, even though the Standard Model has its limitations, it is possible that everything that can actually be measured at the LHC &#8212; which cannot measure neutrino masses or directly observe dark matter or dark energy &#8212; will be well-described by the Standard Model. What if this is the case?</p>
<p><strong>Michelson and Morley, and What They Discovered</strong></p>
<p>In science, giving strong evidence that something <strong>isn&#8217;t</strong> there can be as important as discovering something that <strong>is</strong> there &#8212; and it&#8217;s often harder to do, because you have to thoroughly exclude all possibilities. <em>[It&#8217;s very hard to show that your lost keys are <strong>nowhere</strong> in the house &#8212; you have to convince yourself that you looked <strong>everywhere</strong>.]</em> A famous example is the case of <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1907/michelson-bio.html" target="_blank">Albert Michelson</a>, in his two experiments (one in 1881, a second with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Morley" target="_blank">Edward Morley</a> in 1887) trying to detect the &#8220;ether wind&#8221;.</p>
<p>Light had been shown to be a wave in the 1800s; and like all waves known at the time, it was assumed to be a wave <strong>in</strong> something material, just as sound waves are waves <strong>in</strong> air, and ocean waves are waves <strong>in</strong> water. This material was termed the &#8220;luminiferous ether&#8221;. As we can detect our motion through air or through water in various ways, it seemed that it should be possible to detect our motion through the ether, specifically by looking for the possibility that light traveling in different directions travels at slightly different speeds.  This is what Michelson and Morley were trying to do: detect the movement of the Earth through the luminiferous ether.</p>
<p>Both of Michelson&#8217;s measurements failed to detect any ether wind, and did so expertly and convincingly. And for the convincing method that he invented &#8212; an experimental device called an interferometer, which had many other uses too &#8212; <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1907/press.html" target="_blank">Michelson won the Nobel Prize in 1907</a>. Meanwhile the failure to detect the ether drove both <a href="http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/987/1/Michelson.pdf" target="_blank">FitzGerald and Lorentz to consider radical new ideas about how matter might be deformed</a> as it moves through the ether. Although these ideas weren&#8217;t right, they were important steps that Einstein was able to re-purpose, even more radically, in his 1905 equations of special relativity.</p>
<p>In Michelson&#8217;s case, <strong><em>the failure to discover the ether was itself a discovery</em></strong>, recognized only in retrospect: a discovery that the ether did not exist. <em>(Or, if you&#8217;d like to say that it <strong>does</strong> exist, which some people do, then what was discovered is that the ether is utterly unlike any normal material substance in which waves are observed; no matter how fast or in what direction you are moving relative to me, <strong>both of us are at rest</strong> relative to the ether.)</em> So one must not be too quick to assume that a lack of discovery is actually a step backwards; it may actually be a huge step forward.</p>
<p><strong>Epicycles or a Revolution?</strong></p>
<p>There were various attempts to make sense of Michelson and Morley&#8217;s experiment.   Some interpretations involved  tweaks of the notion of the ether.  Tweaks of this type, in which some original idea (here, the ether) is retained, but adjusted somehow to explain the data, are often referred to as &#8220;epicycles&#8221; by scientists.   <em>(This is analogous to the way <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferent_and_epicycle" target="_blank">an epicycle was used by Ptolemy to explain the complex motions of the planets in the sky</a>, in order to retain an earth-centered universe; the sun-centered solar system requires no such epicycles.)</em> A tweak of this sort <strong><em>could</em></strong> have been the right direction to explain Michelson and Morley&#8217;s data, but as it turned out, it was not. Instead, the non-detection of the ether wind required something more dramatic &#8212; for it turned out that waves of light, though at first glance very similar to other types of waves, were in fact extraordinarily different. <em><strong>There simply was no ether wind for Michelson and Morley to detect</strong></em>.</p>
<p>If the LHC discovers nothing beyond the Standard Model, we will face what I see as a similar mystery.  <a title="Naturalness and the Standard Model" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/naturalness/" target="_blank">As I explained here</a>, the Standard Model, with no other particles added to it, is a consistent but extraordinarily <em>&#8220;unnatural&#8221;</em> (i.e. extremely non-generic) example of <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part 2)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/24/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-2/" target="_blank">a quantum field theory</a>.  This is a big deal. Just as nineteenth-century physicists deeply understood both the <em>theory</em> of waves and many specific <em>examples of waves in nature </em> and had excellent reasons to expect a detectable ether, twenty-first century physicists understand quantum field theory and naturalness both from the theoretical point of view <strong>and</strong> from many examples in nature, and have very good reasons to expect particle physics to be described by a natural theory.  (Our examples come both from condensed matter physics [e.g. metals, magnets, fluids, etc.] and from particle physics [e.g. the physics of <a title="What’s a Hadron?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-hadron-as-in-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">hadrons</a>].) Extremely <strong><em>unnatural</em></strong> systems &#8212; that is, physical systems described by quantum field theories that are <strong><em>highly non-generic</em></strong> &#8212; simply have not previously turned up in nature&#8230; which is just as we would expect from our theoretical understanding.</p>
<p><em>[Experts: As I emphasized in <a href="http://online.kitp.ucsb.edu/online/joefest_c14/" target="_blank">my Santa Barbara talk last week</a>, appealing to anthropic arguments about the hierarchy between gravity and the other forces does <strong>not</strong> allow you to escape from the naturalness problem.]</em></p>
<p>So what might it mean if an unnatural quantum field theory describes all of the measurements at the LHC? It may mean that our understanding of particle physics requires an epicyclic change &#8212; a <em>tweak</em>.  The implications of a tweak would potentially be minor. A tweak might only require us to keep doing what we&#8217;re doing, exploring in the same direction but a little further, working a little harder &#8212; i.e. to keep colliding protons together, but go up in collision energy a bit more, from the LHC to the 100 TeV collider. For instance, perhaps the Standard Model is supplemented by additional particles that, rather than having masses that put them within reach of the LHC, as would inevitably be the case in a <em><strong>natural</strong></em> extension of the Standard Model (here&#8217;s <a title="Supersymmetry — What Is It?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/supersymmetry-what-is-it/" target="_blank">an example</a>), are just <em>a little bit</em> heavier than expected. In this case the world would be <em>somewhat</em> unnatural, but not too much, perhaps through some relatively minor accident of nature; and a 100 TeV collider would have enough energy per collision to discover and reveal the nature of these particles.</p>
<p>Or perhaps a tweak is entirely the wrong idea, and instead our understanding is fundamentally amiss. Perhaps another Einstein will be needed to radically reshape the way we think about what we know.  A<span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;"> dramatic rethink is both more exciting and more disturbing. It was an intellectual challenge for 19th century physicists to imagine, from the result of the Michelson-Morley experiment, that key clues to its explanation would be found in seeking violations of Newton&#8217;s equations for <a title="How Did Einstein Do It?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/mass-and-energy/how-did-einstein-do-it/" target="_blank">how energy and momentum depend on velocity</a>. (The first experiments on this issue were carried out in 1901, but definitive experiments took another 15 years.) It was an even greater challenge to envision that the <a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Le_Verrier.html" target="_blank">already-known unexplained shift in the orbit of Mercury</a> would also be related to the Michelson-Morley (non)-discovery, as Einstein, in trying to adjust Newton&#8217;s gravity to make it consistent with the theory of special relativity, showed in 1913. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">My point is that the experiments that were needed to properly interpret Michelson-Morley&#8217;s result</span></p>
<ul>
<li>did not involve trying to detect motion through the ether,</li>
<li>did not involve building even more powerful and accurate interferometers,</li>
<li>and were not immediately obvious to the practitioners in 1888.</li>
</ul>
<p>This should give us pause. We might, if we continue as we are, be heading in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>Difficult as it is to do, we have to take seriously the possibility that <strong>if</strong> (and remember this is still <em><strong>a very big &#8220;if&#8221;</strong></em>) the LHC finds only what is predicted by the Standard Model, the reason may involve a significant reorganization of our knowledge, perhaps even as great as relativity&#8217;s re-making of our concepts of space and time. Were that the case, it is possible that higher-energy colliders would tell us nothing, and give us no clues at all. An exploratory 100 TeV collider is not guaranteed to reveal secrets of nature, any more than a better version of Michelson-Morley&#8217;s interferometer would have been guaranteed to do so. It may be that a completely different direction of exploration, including directions that currently would seem silly or pointless, will be necessary.</p>
<p>This is not to say that a 100 TeV collider isn&#8217;t needed!  It <em>might</em> be that all we need is a tweak of our current understanding, and then such a machine <em>is</em> exactly what we need, and will be the only way to resolve the current mysteries.  Or it might be that the 100 TeV machine is just what we need to learn something revolutionary.  But we also need to be looking for other lines of investigation, perhaps ones that today would sound unrelated to particle physics, or even unrelated to any known fundamental question about nature.</p>
<p>Let me provide one example from recent history &#8212; one which did not lead to a discovery, but still illustrates that this is not all about 19th century history.</p>
<p><strong>An Example</strong></p>
<p>One of the great contributions to science of Nima Arkani-Hamed, Savas Dimopoulos and Gia Dvali was to observe <em>(in <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9803315" target="_blank">a 1998 paper</a> I&#8217;ll refer to as ADD, after the authors&#8217; initials)</em> that no one had ever excluded the possibility that we, and all the particles from which we&#8217;re made, can move around freely in three spatial dimensions, but are stuck (as it were) as though to the corner edge of a thin rod &#8212; a rod as much as one millimeter wide, into which only gravitational fields (but not, for example, electric fields or magnetic fields) may penetrate.  Moreover, they emphasized that the presence of these extra dimensions might explain why gravity is so much weaker than the other known forces.</p>

<p>Given the incredible number of experiments over the past two centuries that have probed distances vastly smaller than a millimeter, the claim that there could exist millimeter-sized unknown dimensions was amazing, and came as a tremendous shock &#8212; certainly to me. At first, I simply didn&#8217;t believe that the ADD paper could be right.  But it was.</p>
<p>One of the most important immediate effects of the ADD paper was to generate a strong motivation for a new class of experiments that could be done, rather inexpensively, on the top of a table. If the world were as they imagined it might be, then Newton&#8217;s (and Einstein&#8217;s) law for gravity, which states that the force between two stationary objects depends on the distance r between them as 1/r², would increase faster than this at distances shorter than the width of the rod in Figure 1.  This is illustrated in Figure 2.</p>

<p>These experiments are not easy &#8212; gravity is very, very weak compared to electrical forces, and lots of electrical effects can show up at very short distances and have to be cleverly avoided. But some of the best experimentalists in the world figured out how to do it (see <a href="http://www.npl.washington.edu/eotwash/sr" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~aharonk/gravity.html" target="_blank">here</a>). After the experiments were done, Newton/Einstein&#8217;s law was verified down to a few hundredths of a millimeter.  If we live on the corner of a rod, as in Figure 1, it&#8217;s much, much smaller than a millimeter in width.</p>
<p>But it <strong><em>could</em></strong> have been true. And if it had, it might not have been discovered by a huge particle accelerator. It might have been discovered in these small inexpensive experiments <em>that could have been performed years earlier</em>. The experiments weren&#8217;t carried out earlier<span style="color:#333333;"> mainly because no one had pointed out quite how important they could be.</span></p>
<p><strong>Ok Fine; What Other Experiments Should We Do?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">So what are the non-obvious experiments we should be doing now or in the near future?  Well, if I had a really good suggestion for a new class of experiments, I would tell you &#8212; or rather, I would write about it in a scientific paper. (Actually, I <em>do</em> know of <a title="Unexpected Decays of the Higgs Particle: What We Found" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/02/11/non-standard-model-higgs-particle-decays-what-we-found/">an important class of measurements</a>, and I <em>have</em> written <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4992" target="_blank">a scientific paper</a> about them; but these are measurements to be done at the LHC, and don&#8217;t involve a entirely new experiment.)  Although I&#8217;m thinking about these things, I do not yet have any good ideas.  Until I do, or someone else does, this is all just <strong><em>talk</em></strong> &#8212; and talk does not impress physicists. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">Indeed, you might object that my remarks in this post have been almost without content, and possibly without merit.  I agree with that objection.</span></p>
<p>Still, I have some reasons for making these points. In part, I want to highlight, for a wide audience, the possible historic importance of what might now be happening in particle physics. And I especially want to draw the attention of young people. There have been experts in my field who have written that non-discoveries at the LHC constitute a &#8220;nightmare scenario&#8221; for particle physics&#8230; that there might be nothing for particle physicists to do for a long time. But I want to point out that on the contrary, not only may it not be a nightmare, it might actually represent an extraordinary opportunity. Not discovering the ether opened people&#8217;s minds, and eventually opened the door for Einstein to walk through. And if the LHC shows us that particle physics is not described by a natural quantum field theory, it may, similarly, open the door for a young person to show us that our understanding of quantum field theory and naturalness, while as intelligent and sensible and precise as the 19th century understanding of waves, does not apply unaltered to particle physics, and must be significantly revised.</p>
<p>Of course the LHC is still a young machine, and it may still permit additional major discoveries, rendering everything I&#8217;ve said here moot. But young people entering the field, or soon to enter it, should not assume that the experts necessarily understand where the field&#8217;s future lies. Like FitzGerald and Lorentz, even the most brilliant and creative among us might be suffering from our own hard-won and well-established assumptions, and we might soon need the vision of a brilliant young genius &#8212; perhaps a theorist with a clever set of equations, or perhaps an experimentalist with a clever new question and a clever measurement to answer it &#8212; to set us straight, and put us onto the right path.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During the gap between the first run of the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC], which ended in 2012 and included the discovery of <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">the Higgs particle</a> (and the exclusion of quite a few other things), and its second run, which starts a year from now, there&#8217;s been a lot of talk about the future direction for particle physics. By far the most prominent option, both in China and in Europe, involves the long-term possibility of a (roughly) 100 <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/" target="_blank">TeV</a> proton-proton collider &#8212; that is, a particle accelerator like the LHC, but with 5 to 15 times more energy per collision.</p>
<p>Do we need such a machine?<span id="more-7338"></span></p>
<p>The answer is &#8220;Yes, Definitely&#8221;. Definitely, if human beings are to continue to explore the inner world of the elementary laws of nature with the same level of commitment with which they explore the outer world of our neighboring planets, the nearby stars and their own planets, and distant galaxies far-flung across the universe. If we can send the Curiosity rover to roam around the surface of the Red Planet and beam back pictures and scientific information &#8212; if we can send telescopes like Kepler into space whose sole purpose is to look for signs of planets around distant stars &#8212; then surely we can build a machine on Earth whose sole purpose is to help us understand the fundamental principles and elementary objects that underlie the natural world. That&#8217;s why we built the LHC, and machines before it; and the justification for a 100 TeV machine remains the same.</p>
<p>Definitely, also, if the exploration of the laws of nature is to continue as a healthy research field. We have a large number of experts who know how to build a big particle accelerator. If we were to postpone building such a machine for a generation, we would suffer some of the same problems suffered by the U.S. space program. All sorts of crucial knowledge of the craft of rocket building was lost when the U.S. failed to follow up on its several trips to the Moon. If we have a hiatus of a generation between the current machine and the next, we will find it much more difficult and expensive to build the next one when we finally decide to do it. So it makes sense to do maintain continuity, especially if it can be done at reasonable cost.</p>
<p>One thing that&#8217;s interesting to keep in mind is that a roughly 100 TeV machine is hardly a stretch for modern technology; it&#8217;s not going to be a machine with a significant risk of failure. The Superconducting SuperCollider (SSC), which was to be the U.S. flagship machine and was due to start running in the year 2000 (in which case it would definitely have discovered the Higgs particle many years ago &#8212; sadly, the U.S. congress canceled it, <a href="http://www.amusingplanet.com/2010/12/abandoned-remains-of-superconducting.html" target="_blank">after it was well underway</a>, in 1993), would have been a 40 TeV machine. The technological step from 40 TeV to 80 or 120 is not a big one. Moreover, the SSC would have been an easier machine to run than is the LHC, which has to strain with very high collision rates to make up for the fact that its energy per collision is a third of what the SSC would have been capable of. The main challenge for such an accelerator is that it has to be very large &#8212; which requires a very long tunnel (over 50 miles/80 km) and a very large number of powerful magnets.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no wonder the Chinese are interested in potentially building this machine. With an economy growing rapidly enough to catch up with the other great nations of the world in the next decade or two, and with scientific prowess rapidly increasing (see <a title="A Neutrino Success Story" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/04/09/a-neutrino-success-story/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a title="Some Pre-Holiday International Congratulations" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/12/20/some-pre-holiday-international-congratulations/" target="_blank">here</a>), some in China rightly see a 100 TeV proton-proton collider both as an opportunity to gain all sorts of technical and technological knowledge that they have previously lacked, and to establish themselves among the few nations that can be viewed as scientific superpowers. Yet it will not require them to go far out on a limb with technology that no one has ever attempted at all, and invent whole new methods that don&#8217;t currently exist. Moreover, some of the things that would be expensive or politically complex in the U.S. or Europe will be easier in China. They may be able to pay for and construct this machine themselves, with technical advice and personnel from other countries, but without being dependent on other nations&#8217; political and financial challenges.</p>
<p>In fact, there&#8217;s another huge potential benefit along the way, even before the 100 TeV machine is built: a &#8220;Higgs factory&#8221;. One can potentially use this same tunnel to first build an accelerator that smashes electrons and positrons <em>[i.e. anti-electrons]</em> together, at an energy which isn&#8217;t that high, but is sufficient to make Higgs particles at a high rate &#8212; not as many Higgs particles as the LHC will produce, but in an environment where precise measurements are much easier to make. <em>[<a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/" target="_blank">Protons</a> are messy, and all measurements in proton-proton collisions are very difficult due to huge collision rates and large backgrounds; electrons and positrons are simple objects and measurements tend to be much more straightforward.  This comes at a cost: it is harder to get collisions at the highest energies physicists would ideally want.]</em></p>
<p>The value of a Higgs factory is obvious: a no-brainer. The Higgs particle is our main way of gaining insight into the nature of <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">the all-important Higgs field</a>, and moreover the Higgs particle might also, through its possible rare decays, illuminate a currently veiled world of unknown particles and forces. It&#8217;s a research effort whose importance no one can deny, and it serves as a technical stepping stone to a 100 TeV collider, complete with the realistic possibility of Nobel Prize-worthy discoveries in the near term. For China, it&#8217;s perfect.</p>
<p>Of course, the Chinese aren&#8217;t the only ones interested.  My European colleagues, recognizing a good thing when they see it, and with the advantage that they built and ran the LHC, are also considering building such a machine. <em>[Neither the U.S., which is expertly squandering its scientific leadership in many scientific fields (and pushing many of its best scientists toward the Chinese effort), nor Russia, which is busy starting a disastrous invasion of its neighbor, seem able to make any intelligent decisions at the moment, and surely aren&#8217;t going to be the leaders in such an effort.]</em> For the moment, the scientists involved are all working together.  Over recent years, any particle physicist worth his or her salt (<a title="Visiting the Host Lab of the Large Hadron Collider" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/14/visiting-the-host-lab-of-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">including me</a>) would spend some time at Europe&#8217;s CERN laboratory, which hosts the LHC. And now, many young U.S. experts in theoretical particle physics are planning to spend extended time at China&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://cfhep.ihep.ac.cn/" target="_blank">Center for the Future of High Energy Physics</a>&#8220;. There was a time young Chinese geniuses like T.D. Lee, C.N. Yang and C.S. Wu did <a href="http://ccreweb.org/documents/parity/parity.html" target="_blank">Nobel Prize-winning (or -deserving) work</a> in the United States. Soon, perhaps, it will be the other way around.</p>
<p>But what, scientifically, is the justification for this machine?</p>
<p><strong>Why build a 100 TeV collider?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to distinguish two types of scientific enterprises: <strong>exploratory</strong> and <strong>targeted</strong>. <em>Exploratory</em> refers to when you&#8217;re doing a search, in a plausible place, for anything unexpected &#8212; perhaps for something whose existence you might suspect, but perhaps more broadly. <em>Targeted</em> refers to doing a search or study where you know roughly, or even exactly, what you&#8217;re looking for.</p>
<p>Often a targeted enterprise is also exploratory; while looking for one thing, you can always stumble on something else. Many scientific discoveries, such as X-rays, have been made while doing or preparing experiments with a completely different purpose. On the other hand, an exploratory enterprise may not have any targets at all, or at best, only a very vague target. Sometimes we go searching just because we can. When <a title="Reflections on Beauty in Motion" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/reflections-on-beauty-in-motion/" target="_blank">Galileo pointed his first telescopes at the moon and the planets and the stars</a>, he had no idea what he would find; he just knew he had a great opportunity to discover something.</p>
<p>The LHC was built as a clearly targeted machine: its main goal was to find the Higgs particle (or particles) if it (or they) existed, or whatever replaced them if they did not. Well, now we know that one Higgs particle exists, and it resembles the simplest possible type of Higgs particle, which is termed a &#8220;<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/" target="_blank">Standard Model Higgs</a>&#8221;.   But much remains to learn.  Is this Higgs particle really <a title="From “Higgs-like Particle” to “Standard Model-like Higgs”" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/03/15/from-higgs-like-particle-to-standard-model-like-higgs/" target="_blank">Standard Model-like</a>, not just at the 30% level but at the 3% level and better? Are there other Higgs particles?  Are there other as-yet unknown particles being produced at the LHC? Are there new forces beyond the ones we&#8217;re aware of? Other than the detailed study of the new Higgs particle, these questions are mostly exploratory. In short, <em>though the LHC was built as a targeted machine with a near-guarantee of success, its mission has now shifted toward exploration of the unknown</em>, with no guarantee of further discoveries. But it&#8217;s also important to understand that <em>a lack of discoveries will be just as important to our understanding of nature as discoveries would be</em>, for reasons I&#8217;ll return to in my next post.</p>
<p>Now what about the 100 TeV machine? Will it be a targeted experimental facility, or an exploratory one?</p>
<p>For the moment, the answer is: <em>we don&#8217;t know</em>. Currently, there is no clear target; more precisely, there are lots of possible targets, but none that we know could emerge to be a major, central one. But this machine won&#8217;t be built and completed for a couple of decades, and things could change dramatically by then. If the LHC discovers something not predicted by the Standard Model (the equations used to describe <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the known elementary particles and forces</a>), then clarifying this new discovery will become a major target, and possibly the main target, of the 100 TeV machine.</p>
<p>This highlights one of the challenges with large experimental projects. One has to start thinking about them far in advance, long before it&#8217;s entirely clear what their precise use will be. When the SSC and the LHC were first proposed, they did have a proposed target &#8212; finding the Higgs particle or particles. But if the recently discovered Higgs particle&#8217;s mass had been, say, half of what it actually is, it would have been discovered some years before the SSC or LHC were completed&#8230; in which case, the target of the SSC and LHC would have significantly shifted. So we have to start considering, proposing, and perhaps even building the 100 TeV machine before it&#8217;s completely clear whether it will have a prominent and definite target, or whether it will be mainly exploratory. That ambiguity is something we just have to live with.</p>
<p>In contrast to the 100 TeV machine, which currently has to be viewed as exploratory, the Higgs factory that would precede it in the same tunnel is much more sharply targeted&#8230; targeted at detailed study of the Higgs particle. There are some other targeted and exploratory activities that it can be involved in, including more detailed investigation of the Z particle, W particle and top quark, but its main focus is the Higgs.</p>
<p>However, even if no prominent target for the 100 TeV collider shows up before it is built, its justification as an exploratory machine is clear. In quantum field theory, <em>collisions at higher energy and momentum allow you to probe physics at shorter times and distances</em> &#8212; for &#8220;particles&#8221; are really quanta, i.e., ripples in quantum fields, and <strong><em>a higher-energy quantum has a shorter wavelength and a faster frequency</em></strong>. And we&#8217;ve learned time and time again that one way (though not the only one) to discover new things about the world is to examine its behavior on shorter times and shorter distances than we&#8217;ve previously been capable of. This enterprise has been going on for generations; first microscopes discovered bacteria and other cells; then these were found, with more powerful experiments, to be made of <a title="Atoms: Building Blocks of Molecules" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/atoms-building-blocks-of-molecules/" target="_blank">molecules</a>, in turn made from <a title="Atoms: Their Inner Workings" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/atoms-building-blocks-of-molecules/atoms-their-inner-workings/" target="_blank">atoms</a>; yet more powerful experiments showed first that the atoms contain <a title="Electrons: On the Outskirts of Atoms" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/electrons-on-the-outskirts-of-atoms/" target="_blank">electrons</a> and <a title="The Nuclei of Atoms: At the Heart of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-nuclei-of-atoms-at-the-heart-of-matter/" target="_blank">atomic nuclei</a>, then that the nuclei are made from <a title="Protons and Neutrons: The Massive Pandemonium in Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/protons-and-neutrons/" target="_blank">protons and neutrons</a>, and then that these in turn are made from <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">quarks and gluons</a>. All of this has been discovered by probing the world with ever more powerful particle collisions of one form or another. So building a higher energy accelerator is to take another step along a well-trodden path.</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s not the only path, nor has it ever been.</p>
<p><strong>Is this the most promising path to explore?</strong></p>
<p>The LHC is still in its adolescence, and we can&#8217;t predict its future discoveries. At this point the LHC experiments have collected a few percent of the data they&#8217;ll collect over the next decade, and they have done so with proton-proton collisions whose energy is only about 60% of what we expect to see in the next few years. Moreover, even the existing data set, collected in 2011-2012, hasn&#8217;t been fully analyzed; <a title="Unexpected Decays of the Higgs Particle: What We Found" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/02/11/non-standard-model-higgs-particle-decays-what-we-found/" target="_blank">this data could still yield discoveries</a> (but only if the experimenters choose to make the relevant measurements.) So we certainly can&#8217;t know yet whether the LHC will produce a new target for the 100 TeV machine. If it does, then it will be much clearer what to do next and how to use the 100 TeV machine. If it doesn&#8217;t&#8230; well, that&#8217;s something that deserves a bit more discussion.</p>
<p>Suppose that, after the LHC&#8217;s last run, nothing other than the Higgs particle&#8217;s been found, with properties that are consistent, to a few percent, with a Standard Model Higgs. While this sounds dull at first glance, it&#8217;s actually among the most radical possible outcomes of the LHC. That&#8217;s because of the &#8220;naturalness puzzle&#8221;, which I discussed in some detail in <a title="Naturalness and the Standard Model" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/naturalness/" target="_blank">this article</a>. Never before in nature, in any generic context, have we come across a low-mass spin-zero particle (i.e. something like the Higgs particle) without other particles associated with it.  In this sense, <strong><em>the Standard Model is an extraordinarily non-generic theory</em></strong>, at least from our current point of view and understanding.  It will be quite shocking if it completely describes all LHC data.</p>
<p>But maybe it does.  If it does, what does this potentially imply about nature?  And what would be the implications for our future explorations of nature at its most elementary level? I&#8217;ll address this issue in my next post.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.infoplease.com/spot/wintersolstice1.html" target="_blank">December solstice has come and gone at 11:11 a.m. London time</a> (6:11 a.m New York time). That&#8217;s <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2012/06/19/measure-the-tilt-of-the-earth-on-the-solstice-this-wednesday/" target="_blank">the moment when the north pole of the Earth points most away from the sun, and the south pole points most toward it</a>. Because it&#8217;s followed by a weekend and then Christmas Eve, it marks <strong>the end of the 2012 blogging season</strong>, barring a major event between now and year&#8217;s end. But although 11:11 London time is the only moment of astronomical significance during this day (clearly <a title="The Grand Si11iness of 11/11/11 11:11:11" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/xotica/the-grand-si11iness-of-111111-111111/" target="_blank">the universe does not care where humans set our international date line and exactly how we set our time zones, so destruction was never going to be at local midnight</a> &#8212; something <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57560368/its-already-dec-21-in-europe-so-wheres-doomsday/" target="_blank">the media doesn&#8217;t seem to get</a>) it obviously wasn&#8217;t the end of the world.</p>
<p>A lot of people do put a lot of stock in prophecy, including prophecies of the end of the world that nobody ever made (such as <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/20/world/doomsday-coming/index.html?hpt=hp_c1" target="_blank">the one not made for today by the Mayans, through their calendar</a>) and others that people made but were wrong (such as <a title="The Grand Si11iness of 11/11/11 11:11:11" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/11/11/the-grand-si11iness-of-111111-111111/" target="_blank">those made by Harold Camping last year</a> and by many throughout history who preceded him.) If anyone were any good at prophecy they&#8217;d be able to use their special knowledge to become billionaires, so maybe we should be watching Bill Gates and Michael Bloomberg and the Koch brothers and people like that. I haven&#8217;t heard any rumors of them building bunkers or spaceships yet. Of course at the end of the year they may get a small tax hike, but that wouldn&#8217;t be the end of the world.</p>
<p>The <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC], meanwhile, has triumphantly reached the end of its first run of <a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/" target="_blank">proton</a>-proton collisions. Goal #1 of the LHC was to allow physicists at the ATLAS and CMS experiments to discover <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">the Higgs particle, or particles, or whatever took their place in nature</a>; and it would appear that, in a smashing success, <a title="The Day of the Higgs!!!!  DISCOVERY!!! History Made!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/07/04/the-day-of-the-higgs/" target="_blank">they have co-discovered one</a>.  But no Higgs particles, or anything like them, will be produced again until 2015. Although the LHC will run for a short while in early 2013, it will do so in a different mode, smashing not protons but the nuclei of lead atoms together, in order to study the properties of extremely hot and dense matter, under conditions the universe hasn&#8217;t seen since the earliest stages of the Big Bang that launched the current era of our universe.  Then it will be closed down for repairs and upgrades.  So until 2015, any additional information we&#8217;re going to learn about the Higgs particle, or any other unknown particle that might have been produced at the LHC, is going to be obtained by analyzing the data that has been collected in 2011 and 2012. The total amount of data is huge; what was collected in 2012 was about 4.5 times as much as in 2011, and it was taken at 8 <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/" target="_blank">TeV</a> of energy per proton-proton collision rather than 7 TeV as in 2011. I can assure you there will be many new things learned from analyzing that data throughout 2013 and 2014.</p>
<p>Of course <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.1178" target="_blank">a lot of people prophesied confidently</a> that we&#8217;d discover <a title="Supersymmetry" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/" target="_blank">supersymmetry</a>, or something else dramatic, very early on at the LHC. Boy, were they wrong! Those of us who were cautioning against such optimistic statements are not sure whether to laugh or cry, because of course it would have been great to have such a discovery early in the LHC program. But there was ample reason to believe (despite what other bloggers sometimes say) that even if supersymmetry exists and is accessible to the LHC experiments, discovering it could take a lot longer than just two years!  For instance, see <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0607160" target="_blank">this paper written in 2006 pointing out that the search strategies being planned for seeking supersymmetry might fail in the presence of a few extra lightweight particles not predicted in the minimal variants of supersymmetry</a>. As far as I can tell at present, this very big loophole has only partly been closed by the LHC studies done up to now. The same loophole applies for other speculative ideas, including certain variants of LHC-accessible <a title="Extra Dimensions" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/extra-dimensions/" target="_blank">extra dimensions</a>. I am hopeful that these loopholes can be closed in 2013 and 2014, with additional analysis on the current data, but until they are, you should be very cautious believing those who claim that reasonable variants of LHC-accessible supersymmetry (meaning &#8220;natural variants of supersymmetry that resolve <a title="The Hierarchy Problem" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/" target="_blank">the hierarchy problem</a>&#8221;) are ruled out by the LHC experiments. It&#8217;s just not true. Not yet. The only classes of theories that have been almost thoroughly ruled out by LHC data are those predict on general grounds that there should be no observable Higgs particle at all (e.g. classic technicolor).</p>
<p>While we&#8217;re on the subject, I&#8217;ve been looking back at how I did on prophecy this year. It&#8217;s been a remarkably good year, probably my best ever &#8212; though admittedly I only made very easy (though not necessarily common) predictions. First, the really easy one:  <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/01/24/reviewing-the-search-for-the-higgs/" target="_blank">I assured you</a>, as did most of my colleagues, that 2012 would be the Year of the Higgs &#8212; at least, the Year of the Simplest Possible Higgs particle, called the &#8220;<a title="The Standard Model Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/" target="_blank">Standard Model Higgs</a>&#8221;. It would be the year when <a title="Reviewing the Search for the Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/01/24/reviewing-the-search-for-the-higgs/" target="_blank">Phase 1 of the Higgs Search</a> would end &#8212; when we&#8217;d either find a Higgs particle of Standard Model type (or something looking vaguely like it), or, if not, we&#8217;d know we&#8217;d have to move to <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/01/24/reviewing-the-search-for-the-higgs/" target="_blank">a more aggressive search in Phase 2</a>, in which we&#8217;d look for more complicated versions of the Higgs particle that would have been much harder to find. We started the year with <a title="Holiday Higgs Hints: Confidence-Inspiring or Not?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/holiday-higgs-hints-confidence-inspiring-or-not/" target="_blank">ambiguous hints of the Higgs particle, too flimsy to be sure of, but certainly tantalizing, at around a mass of 125 GeV/c<sup>2</sup></a>. In July the hints turned into <a title="Discovery of the Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-discovery-of-the-higgs/" target="_blank">a discovery</a> &#8212; somewhat <a title="Higgs Discovery: Skill and A Little Luck" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-discovery-of-the-higgs/higgs-discovery-skill-and-a-little-luck/" target="_blank">faster than expected</a> for a Standard Model Higgs particle, because the rate for this particle to appear in collisions that produce two photons was higher than anticipated. The excess in the photon signal means either <a title="Higgs Discovery: Is it a Simplest Higgs?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-discovery-of-the-higgs/higgs-discovery-is-it-a-simplest-higgs/" target="_blank">the probability for the Higgs particle to decay to photons is larger than predicted for a Higgs of Standard Model type, or both CMS and ATLAS experienced a fortunate statistical fluctuation that made the discovery easier</a>. We still don&#8217;t know which it was; though we&#8217;ll know more by March, this ambiguity may remain with us until 2015.</p>
<p><a title="Why The Hints of Higgs Currently Rest on Uncertain Ground" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/why-the-hints-of-higgs-currently-rest-on-uncertain-ground/" target="_blank">One prophecy I made all the way back at the beginning of this blog</a>, July 2011, was that the earliest search strategy for the Higgs, through its decays to a lepton, anti-lepton, neutrino and anti-neutrino, wouldn&#8217;t end up being crucial in the discovery; it was just too difficult. <em>(In this experimental context, &#8220;lepton&#8221; refers only to &#8220;electron&#8221; or &#8220;muon&#8221;; taus don&#8217;t count, for technical reasons.)</em> In the end, I said, it would be decays of the Higgs to two photons and to two lepton/anti-lepton pairs that would be the critical ones, because they would provide a clean signal that would be uncontroversial. And that prophesy was correct; <a title="Higgs Discovery: The Data" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-discovery-of-the-higgs/higgs-discovery-the-data/" target="_blank">the photon-based and lepton-based searches were the signals that led to discovery</a>.</p>
<p>Now we&#8217;ve reached December, and <a title="Another Higgs Update from CERN" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/12/13/another-higgs-update-from-cern/" target="_blank">the data seems to imply that except possibly for this overabundance of photons, which still tantalizes us, the various measurements of how the Higgs-like particle is produced and decays are starting to agree, to a precision which is still only moderate, with the predictions of the Standard Model for a Higgs of this mass</a>. Fewer and fewer experts are still suggesting that this is not a Higgs particle. But it will be some years yet &#8212; 2018 or later &#8212; before measurements are precise enough to start convincing people that this Higgs particle is really of Standard Model type. Many variants of the Standard Model, with new particles and forces, predict that the difference of the real Higgs from a Standard Model Higgs may be subtle, with deviations at the ten percent level or even less. Meanwhile, other Higgs-like particles, with different masses and different properties, might be hiding in the data, and it may take quite a while to track them down. Many years of data collecting and data analysis lie ahead, in <a title="Reviewing the Search for the Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/01/24/reviewing-the-search-for-the-higgs/" target="_blank">Phase 2 of the Higgs search</a>.</p>
<p>Another prophecy I made at the beginning of the year was that <a title="Exotic Decays of the Higgs: A High Priority for 2012" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/01/27/exotic-decays-of-the-higgs-a-high-priority-for-2012/" target="_blank">Exotic Decays of the Higgs would be a high priority for 2012</a>. You might think this prophesy was wrong, because in fact, so far, there have been very few searches at ATLAS, CMS and LHCb for such decays. But the challenge that required prioritizing these decays wasn&#8217;t <em>data analysis</em>; it was the problem of even <em>collecting the data</em>. The problem is that many exotic decays of the Higgs would lead to events that might not be selected by the all-important <a title="Dumping Data Overboard: The Trigger at an LHC Experiment" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/11/04/dumping-data-overboard-the-trigger-at-an-lhc-experiment/" target="_blank">trigger system that determines which tiny fraction of the LHC&#8217;s collisions to store permanently for analysis</a>! At the beginning of 2012 <a title="Exotic Decays of the Higgs: A High Priority for 2012" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/01/27/exotic-decays-of-the-higgs-a-high-priority-for-2012/" target="_blank">there was a risk that some of these processes would have been dumped by the trigger and irretrievably lost from the 2012 data</a>, making future searches for such decays impossible or greatly degraded. At a hadron collider like the LHC, you have to think ahead! If you don&#8217;t consider carefully the analyses you&#8217;ll want to do a year or two from now, you may not set the trigger properly today. So although the priority for <em>data analysis</em> in 2012 was to find the Higgs particle and measure its bread-and-butter properties, the fact that the Higgs has come out looking more or less Standard Model-like in 2012 means that focusing on exotic possibilities, including exotic decays, will be one of the obvious places to look for something new, and thus a very high priority for data analysis, in 2013 and 2014. <strong><em>And that&#8217;s why, for the trigger &#8212; for the collection of the data &#8212; exotic decays were a very high priority for 2012</em></strong>. Indeed, one significant use of <a title="Data Parking at CMS" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/lhcposts/triggering-advances-in-2012/data-parking-at-cms/" target="_blank">the new strategy of delayed data streaming at ATLAS and of data parking at CMS (two names for the same thing)</a> was to address this priority. <em>[My participation in this effort, working with experimentalists and with several young theorists, was my most rewarding project of 2012.]</em>  As I explained to you, <a title="Lightweight Higgs: A `Sensitive Creature’" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/lightweight-higgs-a-sensitive-creature/" target="_blank">a Higgs particle with a low mass, such as 125 GeV/c<sup>2</sup>, is very sensitive to the presence of new particles and forces</a> that are otherwise very difficult to detect, and it easily could exhibit one or more types of exotic decays.  So there will be a lot of effort put into looking for signs of exotic decays in 2013 and 2014! I&#8217;m very excited about all the work that lies ahead of us.</p>
<p>Now, the prophecy I&#8217;d like to make, but cannot &#8212; because I do not have any special insight into the answer &#8212; is on the question of whether the LHC will make great new discoveries in the future, or whether the LHC has already made its last discovery: a Higgs particle of Standard Model type. Even if the latter is the case, we will need years of data from the LHC in order to distinguish these two possibilities; there&#8217;s no way for us to guess. It&#8217;s clear that Nature&#8217;s holding secrets from us.  We know the Standard Model (the equations we use to describe all <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the known particles and forces</a>) is not a complete theory of nature, because it doesn&#8217;t explain things like dark matter<em> (hey, <a title="Dark Matter: Now You See It, Now You Don’t" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/04/20/dark-matter-now-you-see-it-now-you-dont/">were dark matter particles perhaps discovered</a> in 2012?)</em>, and it doesn&#8217;t tell us why, for example, there are <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">six types of quarks</a>, or why the heaviest quark has a mass that is more than 10,000 times larger than the mass of the lightest quarks, etc. What we don&#8217;t know is whether the answers to those secrets are accessible to the LHC; does it have enough energy per collision, and enough collisions, for the job?  The only way to find out is to run the LHC, and to dig thoroughly through its data for any sign of anything amiss with the predictions of the Standard Model. This is very hard work, and it will take the rest of the decade (but not until the end of the world.)</p>
<p>In the meantime, please do not fret about the quiet in the tunnel outside Geneva, Switzerland. The LHC will be back, bigger and better (well, at least with more energy per collision) in 2015. And while we wait during the two year shutdown, the experimentalists at ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb will be hard at work, producing many new results from the 2011 and 2012 proton collision data! Even <a title="The Tevatron Comes to an End" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/09/30/the-tevatron-comes-to-an-end/" target="_blank">the experiments CDF and DZero from the terminated Tevatron</a> are still writing new papers. In short, fear not: not only isn&#8217;t the December solstice of 2012 the end of the world, it doesn&#8217;t even signal a temporary stop to the news about the Higgs particle!</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In case you haven&#8217;t yet heard (<a title="Guess What?! Neutrinos Travel Just Below the Speed of Light" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/06/08/guess-what-neutrinos-travel-just-below-the-speed-of-light/" target="_blank">check my previous post from this morning</a>), neutrinos traveling 730 kilometers from the CERN laboratory to the Gran Sasso laboratory do arrive at the time <a title="Mass and Energy" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/mass-and-energy/" target="_blank">Einstein&#8217;s special relativity</a> predicts they would.</p>
<p>Of course (as the press mostly seems to forget) <strong>we knew that</strong>.  We knew it because</p>
<ul>
<li>ICARUS <em><strong>already</strong></em> made the measurement of timing, based on October 2011 data, and presented their result in March.  That was a refutation of OPERA&#8217;s original result.  <a title="This Time, ICARUS Really DOES Refute OPERA" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/16/this-time-icarus-really-does-refute-opera/">I wrote about that here.</a></li>
<li>OPERA itself preliminarily <strong><em>confirmed</em></strong> (quietly and without fanfare, just before<a title="OPERA: What Went Wrong" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/neutrinos-faster-than-light/opera-what-went-wrong/" target="_blank"> the two leaders of the experiment stepped down from their leadership positions</a>) that <a title="Finally An OPERA Plot that Makes Some Sense" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/02/24/finally-an-opera-plot-that-makes-some-sense/" target="_blank">the two problems it identified in December and reported on in public in February</a> did <a title="OPERA: What Went Wrong" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/neutrinos-faster-than-light/opera-what-went-wrong/" target="_blank">appear to be of the right size and shape to cause its false results</a> for both OPERA-1 and OPERA-2 (<a title="OPERA: Comparing the Two Versions" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/neutrinos-faster-than-light/opera-comparing-the-two-versions/">the 2008-2011 long-pulse measurement and the October 2011 short-pulse measurement.</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>So the news from the Neutrino 2012 conference in Kyoto, on new data from May 2012 taken by OPERA and three nearby experiments, is no surprise to anyone who was paying attention back in March and early April; it&#8217;s <em>exactly</em> what we were expecting.</p>
<p>One thing that almost no one is reporting, as far as I can tell, is that CERN&#8217;s research director Sergio Bertolucci did not give the first talk on neutrino speeds in Kyoto.  That talk was given by Marcos Dracos, of OPERA.  Dracos presented both OPERA&#8217;s corrected 2011 results (<a title="OPERA: What Went Wrong" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/neutrinos-faster-than-light/opera-what-went-wrong/" target="_blank">with corrections based on the detailed investigation shown in March of the problems reported back in February)</a> and also the new 2012 results, which were taken with a kind of short-pulse beams similar to that used in <a title="OPERA: Comparing the Two Versions" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/neutrinos-faster-than-light/opera-comparing-the-two-versions/" target="_blank">OPERA-2</a>.  (<a title="OPERA: Comparing the Two Versions" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/neutrinos-faster-than-light/opera-comparing-the-two-versions/" target="_blank">A short pulse beam allows for a neutrino speed measurement to be made rather easily and quickly</a>, at the expense of OPERA&#8217;s <a title="Neutrino Types and Neutrino Oscillations" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/neutrino-types-and-neutrino-oscillations/" target="_blank">neutrino oscillation</a> studies, which were the main purpose of building the OPERA experiment.)</p>
<p>Following Dracos&#8217; talk, Bertolucci spoke next, and reported the results of the neighboring Borexino, LVD and ICARUS experiments on the May 2012 data, which along with OPERA are all bathed in the same CERN-to-Gran Sasso neutrino beam, and collected their data simultaneously.  All of the results are preliminary so <strong><em>the numbers below will change in detail.</em></strong><em></em>  But they are not going to change very much.  Here they are: neutrinos arrive at a time that differs from expectation by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Borexino: δt = 2.7 ± 1.2 (stat) ± 3 (sys) ns</li>
<li>ICARUS: δt = 5.1 ± 1.1 (stat) ± 5.5 (sys) ns</li>
<li>LVD: δt = 2.9 ± 0.6 (stat) ± 3 (sys) ns</li>
<li>OPERA: δt = 1.6 ± 1.1 (stat) [+ 6.1, -3.7] (sys) ns</li>
</ul>
<p>(Here &#8220;ns&#8221; means nanoseconds, and &#8220;stat&#8221; and &#8220;sys&#8221; mean statistical and systematic uncertainty.)  The original OPERA result was an early arrival of about 60 nanoseconds, about six standard deviations away from expectations.  You see that all the experiments are consistent with zero early/late arrival to about 1 standard deviation &#8212; almost too consistent, in fact, for four experiments.</p>
<p>So there is no longer any hint of any evidence whatsoever of a problem with the predictions of special relativity, and in particular with the existence of a universal speed limit.</p>
<p>A summing up is called for, but I want to write that carefully.  So unless something else comes up, that&#8217;s all for today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Five out of five experiments agree: <em><strong>neutrinos do not travel faster than the speed limit.</strong></em></p>
<p>Or more precisely: to within the uncertainties of current measurements, neutrino speed, for neutrinos with <a title="Mass and Energy" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/mass-and-energy/" target="_blank">energies far larger than their masses</a>, is experimentally indistinguishable from the speed of light in vacuum.  This is just as expected in standard Einsteinian special relativity, which would predict they move just below light speed, by an amount too small to measure with current experiments.</p>
<p><a href="http://press.web.cern.ch/press/PressReleases/Releases2011/PR19.11E.html">http://press.web.cern.ch/press/PressReleases/Releases2011/PR19.11E.html</a></p>
<p>Based on data taken in May 2012 using a beam of neutrinos sent from the CERN laboratory to the <a href="http://www.lngs.infn.it/" target="_blank">Gran Sasso</a> lab, the four experiments <a title="This Time, ICARUS Really DOES Refute OPERA" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/16/this-time-icarus-really-does-refute-opera/" target="_blank">ICARUS</a>, <a title="How LVD Helped Solve OPERA’s Mystery" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/neutrinos-faster-than-light/opera-what-went-wrong/how-opera-and-lvd-confirmed-operas-problem/" target="_blank">LVD</a>, Borexino and even <a title="Denouement: How OPERA’s Mystery Was Solved" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/04/02/denouement-how-operas-mystery-was-solved/" target="_blank">OPERA</a> (the source of  all the excitement) find results consistent with the speed of light, with uncertainties (at one-standard-deviation) about 10 times smaller than <a title="OPERA: What Went Wrong" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/neutrinos-faster-than-light/opera-what-went-wrong/" target="_blank">OPERA&#8217;s original measured deviation of neutrino speed from the speed of light</a>.  The new results are consistent with <a title="This Time, ICARUS Really DOES Refute OPERA" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/16/this-time-icarus-really-does-refute-opera/" target="_blank">ICARUS&#8217;s result from 2011 data</a>.  Moreover, <a title="OPERA: Comparing the Two Versions" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/neutrinos-faster-than-light/opera-comparing-the-two-versions/" target="_blank">OPERA&#8217;s mistaken result from September and November 2011</a> &#8212; a claimed six standard deviations away from the expected speed &#8212; has now been corrected, <a title="How LVD Helped Solve OPERA’s Mystery" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/neutrinos-faster-than-light/opera-what-went-wrong/how-opera-and-lvd-confirmed-operas-problem/" target="_blank">following their detective work presented in March</a>.  Even <a title="A Few Tidbits from Nagoya, including OPERA news" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/10/26/a-few-tidbits-from-nagoya-including-opera-news/" target="_blank">MINOS</a>, a U.S. experiment, has revised their older result, which was previously slightly discrepant from the speed of light by a small amount (two standard deviations), and they find now that their data too are quite consistent with neutrinos traveling with light speed, though with much less precision in the measurement.</p>
<p>And so with a final quintet, sung in unison, this <a title="Neutrinos Faster Than Light?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/neutrinos-faster-than-light/" target="_blank">melodramatic comic OPERA buffa</a> comes to a close.  As with all classic operatic comedies, there&#8217;s been crisis, chaos, and a good bit of hilarity, all the while with wise voices speaking reason to no avail, but in the end the overzealous are chastened, the righteous are made whole, everyone (even the miscreant) is happy, and all is well with the world.</p>
<p>Curtain!! Applause!!  Science Triumphant!!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A brief mention today of <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1205.5442" target="_blank">a new measurement from the BABAR experimental collaboration</a>, which tests lepton universality (to be explained below) and finds it wanting.</p>
<p><strong>The Basic Story (Slightly Oversimplified)</strong></p>
<p>Within the Standard Model of particle physics (the equations that describe and predict the behavior of all of <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the known particles and forces</a>), the effects of the weak nuclear force on the three leptons &#8212; the electron, the muon and the tau &#8212; are all expected to be identical. This called &#8220;lepton universality&#8221;. <span id="more-3665"></span>This expectation has been tested many times; for instance, the probability that a negatively charged W particle decays to an electron plus an electron anti-neutrino is the same as for it to decay to a muon plus a muon anti-neutrino, and the same for a tau plus a tau anti-neutrino, to very good precision.</p>
<p>Another place (see Figure 1) to test &#8220;lepton universality&#8221; is in the decay of a <a title="What’s a Hadron?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-hadron-as-in-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">hadron</a> containing a bottom quark to a hadron containing a charm quark plus a lepton plus a corresponding anti-neutrino. (Specifically, the focus here is on hadrons called &#8220;mesons&#8221; which contain a bottom quark or charm quark, an up or down anti-quark,and, as for all hadrons, lots of gluons and quark-antiquark pairs.)</p>

The D meson will rapidly decay to other particles (not shown, but these must all be experimentally detected in order to know a D meson was present) and the tau will also rapidly decay, sometimes to an electron or muon, along with an undetectable neutrino and anti-neutrino.&lt;/p&gt;

The tau will rapidly decay, sometimes to an electron or muon, along with an undetectable neutrino and anti-neutrino.  The D meson will also rapidly decay to other particles (not shown); these must all be experimentally detected in order to know a D meson was present. Only the bottom and charm quarks in the mesons are shown, but the mesons also contain an up and down anti-quark, along with many gluons and quark-antiquark pairs.</p></div>
<p>These decays occur via the weak nuclear force (more precisely, through the effect of a W <a title="Virtual Particles: What are they?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/virtual-particles-what-are-they/" target="_blank">&#8220;virtual particle&#8221; [which is not really a particle at all, but a more generalized disturbance in the W field]</a>) so the probability for such a decay in which a tau is produced should be related to the probability for the case where a muon or electron is produced. The meson with a bottom quark is called a B, the meson with a charm quark is called a D, so for shorthand the decays to the three leptons and their corresponding anti-neutrinos are called B → D e ν, B → D μ ν and B → D τ ν.</p>
<p>However, testing lepton universality in this particular context is a little tricky, because <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the masses of the three leptons</a> are different &#8212; because their interactions with the Higgs field are not universal &#8212; and in this class of decays, the difference matters. Whereas a W particle has a mass of 80 GeV/c<sup>2</sup>, so big that the tau lepton&#8217;s 1.8 GeV/c<sup>2</sup> mass is too small to play any role in the W&#8217;s decay, the B and D mesons have masses around 5.3 and 1.9 GeV/c<sup>2</sup> respectively, and the difference in those masses is not that much bigger than the tau&#8217;s mass. As a result, although the probability of B → D e ν and B → D μ ν are expected to be (and are measured to be) the same, the probability for B → D τ ν is not expected to be the same as for B → D e ν. But, with some difficulty, the difference in these probabilities can be predicted using the Standard Model&#8217;s equations. And recently the relative probabilities have been measured, by the <a href="http://www-public.slac.stanford.edu/babar/" target="_blank">BABAR experiment</a> (which studied B mesons produced in the collisions of electrons and positrons at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in California; the experiment was shut down in 2008, but data analysis continues.) <em><strong>The measurement differs from the prediction, coming in too high by what can arguably be said to be 3.4 standard deviations (3.4 &#8220;σ&#8221;.)</strong></em></p>
<p>That&#8217;s the short story. The real story is quite a bit longer, as always.</p>
<p><strong>Some Additional Important Details</strong></p>
<p>First, this is not a completely straightforward measurement. τ leptons can&#8217;t be measured directly, because they decay very quickly. In this measurement, they are detected only when they decay to electrons or to muons, plus a neutrino and anti-neutrino that go undetected. Wait, you say&#8230; how can we tell the difference between B → D e ν and B → D τ ν if the τ then decays to an e plus undetected neutrinos?! The reason is that on average the electron from the τ decay has lower energy (and there are other tricks too.) Even better, an electron-positron collider is a precision machine, unlike <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">a hadron collider like the LHC</a>, so the total energy and total momentum of the undetected neutrinos can be inferred from the measurement of everything that <em>is</em> detected. If there&#8217;s only one neutrino or anti-neutrino, as in B → D e ν, then (because the neutrino mass is so tiny) you would expect the missing momentum and missing energy to satisfy E<sub>miss</sub> = p<sub>miss</sub> c to the available precision. If there are three neutrinos or anti-neutrinos, as in B → D τ ν, you expect the E<sub>miss</sub> &gt; p<sub>miss</sub> c. Technically, we define &#8220;missing mass&#8221; by m<sub>miss</sub><sup>2</sup> c<sup>4</sup> = E<sub>miss</sub><sup>2</sup> &#8211; p<sub>miss</sub><sup>2</sup>c<sup>2</sup> ; it is substantially non-zero only for the decays to taus. (The name is misleading; it isn&#8217;t mass that is missing, but the invariant mass of the undetected particles.)</p>
<p>So in the end it is possible to look for B → D + e + invisible particles, and separate (on average, statistically &#8212; see Figure 2) the ones that have a higher energy lepton and no &#8220;missing mass&#8221; that come from B → D e ν from the lower energy ones with &#8220;missing mass&#8221; that come from B → D τ ν. Unfortunately, the measurement is made more complicated by the presence of some other unrelated processes that give a similar-looking signal. But these effects are believed to be known to sufficient precision as to not interfere with the measurement. [Nevertheless, this appears to be one of the weakest points in the measurement &#8212; though I don&#8217;t yet know all the details of the measurement technique and so I might be wrong.]</p>

<p>Second, I&#8217;ve oversimplified; there are two types of common B and D mesons; those with spin 0 are called B and D, while those with spin 1 are called B* and D*. The experimenters have measured both B → D* τ ν relative to B → D e ν and B → D τ ν relative to B → D* e ν. Both come out high, by 2.0 and 2.7 σ. Only when combined together does one obtain the claimed 3.4 σ.</p>

</ul>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:25px;">Here the first and second error bars on the measurements are statistical and systematic uncertainties, and the error on the prediction indicates known uncertainties in the calculation.</span></p>
<p><strong>Implications, If Any</strong></p>
<p>Is this excess a real effect that indicates a breakdown of the Standard Model? We&#8217;ve seen plenty of measurements with 3 σ deviations from the Standard Model prediction in the past year (see <a title="LHCb’s Result From November Appears Confirmed by CDF" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/01/lhcbs-result-from-november-appears-confirmed-by-cdf/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a title="Apparent Unexpected Asymmetries in the Production of Quarks" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/tevatron-news/apparent-unexpected-asymmetries-in-the-production-of-quarks/" target="_blank">here</a> for examples), but in some cases it looks as though the measurement may have been wrong, or simply a statistical fluctuation, while in others it looks as though the original theoretical prediction may have wrong. We can hope this new measurement indicates something real, but <strong><em>as usual, while it is worth taking note of, it is too early to get very excited</em></strong>. We need to see confirmation by another experiment and some additional theoretical checks on the predictions.</p>
<p>If it is a real effect, what could cause it? One obvious possible source of a violation of universality could be a new electrically-charged Higgs particle, not predicted in the Standard Model but predicted by many theories that have multiple Higgs fields and particles. (Among them is <a title="Supersymmetry — What Is It?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/supersymmetry-what-is-it/" target="_blank">supersymmetry</a>.) In simple versions of this idea, a charged Higgs <a title="Virtual Particles: What are they?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/virtual-particles-what-are-they/" target="_blank">virtual particle (which isn&#8217;t really a particle, but a more general disturbance in the charged Higgs field)</a> would contribute to these processes (Figure 3), and change the B → D τ ν rate more than the other two, because it interacts much more strongly with the heavier tau lepton than with the electron or muon. BABAR claims that the simplest version of this idea doesn&#8217;t fit their data, but there are a lot of subtleties with that remark (in particular the presence of a new particle changes not only the decay probabilities but also the energy distributions shown in Figure 2, so the data has to be reanalysed carefully for each possible type of charged Higgs.)</p>

<p>Are there any other possibilities? Good question. One thing that is worth noting is that this effect (at least as currently measured) is very large &#8212; I&#8217;m referring here not its statistical significance of 3.4 σ, which is moderate at best, but the size of the effect itself, something like a 50% excess over expectation from the Standard Model prediction. It is not easy to get an effect that big from anything indirect, such as a complicated quantum mechanical process. In fact, even a direct effect from a single virtual particle, along the lines of the charged Higgs idea, has to be on the large side &#8212; especially since any simple charged (non-virtual!) particle of this type has to be quite heavy (certainly heavier than 100 GeV/c<sup>2</sup>, from LEP collider measurements, and <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/18/at-the-search-workshop-on-the-lhc/" target="_blank">probably closer to 150</a>, from LHC measurements).  Making a theory with such a large effect consistent with all other existing measurements may be a tall order.</p>
