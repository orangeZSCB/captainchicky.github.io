<p>Over the past weekend, two of the world&#8217;s most influential and brilliant theoretical high-energy physicists &#8212; Steve Gubser of Princeton University and Ann Nelson of the University of Washington &#8212; fell to their deaths in separate mountain accidents, one in the Alps and one in the Cascades.</p>
<p>Theoretical high energy physics is a small community, and within the United States itself the community is tiny.  Ann and Steve were both justifiably famous and highly respected as exceptionally bright lights in their areas of research. Even for those who had not met them personally, this is a stunning and irreplaceable loss of talent and of knowledge.</p>
<p>But most of us did know them personally.  For me, and for others with a personal connection to them, the news is devastating and tragic. I encountered Steve when he was a student and I was a postdoc in the Princeton area, and later helped bring him into a social group where he met his future wife (a great scientist in her own right, and a friend of mine going back decades).  As for Ann, she was one of my teachers at Stanford in graduate school, then my senior colleague on four long scientific papers, and then my colleague (along with her husband David B. Kaplan) for five years at the University of Washington, where she had the office next to mine. I cannot express what a privilege it always was to work with her, learn from her, and laugh with her.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have the heart or energy right now to write more about this, but I will try to do so at a later time. Right now I join their spouses and families, and my colleagues, in mourning.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week, the community of high-energy physicists &#8212; of those of us fascinated by particles, fields, strings, black holes, and the universe at large &#8212; is mourning the loss of one of the great theoretical physicists of our time, Joe Polchinski. It pains me deeply to write these words.</p>
<p>Everyone who knew him personally will miss his special qualities &#8212; his boyish grin, his slightly wicked sense of humor, his charming way of stopping mid-sentence to think deeply, his athleticism and friendly competitiveness. Everyone who knew his research will feel the absence of his particular form of genius, his exceptional insight, his unique combination of abilities, which I&#8217;ll try to sketch for you below. Those of us who were lucky enough to know him both personally and scientifically &#8212; well, we lose twice.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/kitp/news/polchinski.jpg" alt="Image result for joe polchinski" /></p>
<p>Polchinski &#8212; Joe, to all his colleagues &#8212; had one of those brains that works magic, and works magically. Scientific minds are as individual as personalities. Each physicist has a unique combination of talents and skills (and weaknesses); in modern lingo, each of us has a superpower or two. Rarely do you find two scientists who have the same ones.</p>
<p>Joe had several superpowers, and they were really strong. He had a tremendous knack for looking at old problems and seeing them in a new light, often overturning conventional wisdom or restating that wisdom in a new, clearer way. And he had prodigious technical ability, which allowed him to follow difficult calculations all the way to the end, on paths that would have deterred most of us.</p>
<p>One of the greatest privileges of my life was to work with Joe, not once but four times. I think I can best tell you a little about him, and about some of his greatest achievements, through the lens of that unforgettable experience.</p>
<p><em>[To my colleagues: this post was obviously written in trying circumstances, and it is certainly possible that my memory of distant events is foggy and in error.  I welcome any corrections that you might wish to suggest.]</em></p>
<p>Our papers between 1999 and 2006 were a sequence of sorts, aimed at understanding more fully the profound connection between quantum field theory &#8212; the language of particle physics &#8212; and string theory &#8212; best-known today as a candidate for a quantum theory of gravity. In each of those papers, as in many thousands of others written after 1995, Joe&#8217;s most influential contribution to physics played a central role. This was the discovery of objects known as &#8220;D-branes&#8221;, which he found in the context of string theory. (The term is a generalization of the word `membrane&#8217;.)</p>
<p>I can already hear the polemical haters of string theory screaming at me. &#8216;<em>A discovery in <strong>string theory</strong>,&#8217;</em> some will shout, pounding the table, &#8216;<em>an untested and untestable theory that&#8217;s not even wrong, should not be called a discovery in <strong>physics</strong></em>.&#8217; Pay them no mind; they&#8217;re not even close, as you&#8217;ll see by the end of my remarks.</p>
<p><strong>The Great D-scovery</strong></p>
<p>In 1989, Joe, working with two young scientists, Jin Dai and Rob Leigh, was exploring some details of string theory, and carrying out a little mathematical exercise. Normally, in string theory, strings are little lines or loops that are free to move around anywhere they like, much like particles moving around in this room. But in some cases, particles aren&#8217;t in fact free to move around; you could, for instance, study particles that are trapped on the surface of a liquid, or trapped in a very thin whisker of metal. With strings, there can be a new type of trapping that particles can&#8217;t have &#8212; you could perhaps trap one end, or both ends, of the string within a surface, while allowing the middle of the string to move freely. The place <em><strong>where</strong></em> <strong><em>a string&#8217;s end may be trapped</em></strong> &#8212; whether a point, a line, a surface, or something more exotic in higher dimensions &#8212; is what we now call a &#8220;D-brane&#8221;.  <em>[The `D&#8217; arises for uninteresting technical reasons.]</em></p>
<p>Joe and his co-workers hit the jackpot, but they didn&#8217;t realize it yet. What they discovered, in retrospect, was that D-branes are an <em>automatic</em> feature of string theory. They&#8217;re not optional; you can&#8217;t choose to study string theories that don&#8217;t have them. And they aren&#8217;t just surfaces or lines that sit still. They&#8217;re physical objects that can roam the world. They have mass and create gravitational effects. They can move around and scatter off each other. They&#8217;re just as real, and just as important, as the strings themselves!</p>
<div style="width: 382px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/string/dbrane.jpg" alt="D-Branes" width="372" height="420" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Fig. 1: D branes (in green) are physical objects on which a fundamental string (in red) can terminate.</p></div>
<p>It was as though Joe and his collaborators started off trying to understand why the chicken crossed the road, and ended up discovering the existence of bicycles, cars, trucks, buses, and jet aircraft.  It was that unexpected, and that rich.</p>
<p>And yet, nobody, not even Joe and his colleagues, quite realized what they&#8217;d done. Rob Leigh, Joe&#8217;s co-author, had the office next to mine for a couple of years, and we wrote five papers together between 1993 and 1995. Yet I think Rob mentioned his work on D-branes to me just once or twice, in passing, and never explained it to me in detail. Their paper had less than twenty citations as 1995 began.</p>
<p>In 1995 the understanding of string theory took a huge leap forward. That was the moment when it was realized that all five known types of string theory are different sides of the same die &#8212; that there&#8217;s really only one string theory.  A flood of papers appeared in which certain black holes, and generalizations of black holes &#8212; black strings, black surfaces, and the like &#8212; played a central role. The relations among these were fascinating, but often confusing.</p>
<p>And then, on October 5, 1995, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9510017">a paper appeared that changed the whole discussion</a>, forever. It was Joe, explaining D-branes to those of us who&#8217;d barely heard of his earlier work, and showing that many of these black holes, black strings and black surfaces were actually D-branes in disguise. His paper made everything clearer, simpler, and easier to calculate; it was an immediate hit. By the beginning of 1996 it had 50 citations; twelve months later, the citation count was approaching 300.</p>
<p><em>So what? Great for string theorists, but without any connection to experiment and the real world.  What good is it to the rest of us?</em> Patience. I&#8217;m just getting to that.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s it Got to Do With Nature?</strong></p>
<p>Our current understanding of the make-up and workings of the universe is in terms of particles. Material objects are made from atoms, themselves made from electrons orbiting a nucleus; and the nucleus is made from neutrons and protons. We learned in the 1970s that protons and neutrons are themselves made from particles called quarks and antiquarks and gluons &#8212; specifically, from a &#8220;sea&#8221; of gluons and a few quark/anti-quark pairs, within which sit three additional quarks with no anti-quark partner&#8230; often called the `valence quarks&#8217;.  We call protons and neutrons, and all other particles with three valence quarks, `baryons&#8221;.   (Note that there are no particles with just one valence quark, or two, or four &#8212; all you get is baryons, with three.)</p>
<p>In the 1950s and 1960s, physicists discovered short-lived particles much like protons and neutrons, with a similar sea, but which  contain one valence quark and one valence anti-quark. Particles of this type are referred to as &#8220;mesons&#8221;.  I&#8217;ve sketched a typical meson and a typical baryon in Figure 2.  (The simplest meson is called a &#8220;pion&#8221;; it&#8217;s the most common particle produced in the proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider.)</p>

<p>But the quark/gluon picture of mesons and baryons, back in the late 1960s, was just an idea, and it was in competition with a proposal that mesons are little strings. These are not, I hasten to add, the &#8220;theory of everything&#8221; strings that you learn about in Brian Greene&#8217;s books, which are a billion billion times smaller than a proton. In a &#8220;theory of everything&#8221; string theory, often <em>all</em> the types of particles of nature, including electrons, photons and Higgs bosons, are tiny tiny strings. What I&#8217;m talking about is a &#8220;theory of mesons&#8221; string theory, a much less ambitious idea, in which only the mesons are strings.  They&#8217;re much larger: just about as long as a proton is wide. That&#8217;s small by human standards, but immense compared to theory-of-everything strings.</p>
<p>Why did people think mesons were strings? <strong><em>Because there was <a href="http://www.scielo.br/img/revistas/bjp/v35n1/a06fig04.gif">experimental evidence</a> for it! </em></strong>(Here&#8217;s <a href="http://slideplayer.com/slide/9177976/27/images/11/Elastic+scattering+Impact+picture+and+Regge+models.jpg">another example</a>.)  And that evidence didn&#8217;t go away after quarks were discovered. Instead, theoretical physicists gradually understood <em>why</em> quarks and gluons might produce mesons that behave a bit like strings. If you spin a meson fast enough (and this can happen by accident in experiments), its valence quark and anti-quark may separate, and the sea of objects between them forms what is called a &#8220;flux tube.&#8221; See Figure 3. <em>[In certain superconductors, somewhat similar flux tubes can trap magnetic fields.]</em> It&#8217;s kind of a thick string rather than a thin one, but still, it shares enough properties with a string in string theory that it can produce experimental results that are similar to string theory&#8217;s predictions.</p>

<p>And so, from the mid-1970s onward, people were confident that quantum field theories like the one that describes quarks and gluons can create objects with stringy behavior. A number of physicists &#8212; including some of the most famous and respected ones &#8212; made a bolder, more ambitious claim: <em>that quantum field theory and string theory are profoundly related, in some fundamental way.</em> But they weren&#8217;t able to be precise about it; they had strong evidence, but it wasn&#8217;t ever entirely clear or convincing.</p>
<p>In particular, there was an important unresolved puzzle. If mesons are strings, then what are baryons? What are protons and neutrons, with their three valence quarks? What do they look like if you spin them quickly? The sketches people drew looked something like Figure 3. A baryon would perhaps become three joined flux tubes (with one possibly much longer than the other two), each with its own valence quark at the end.  In a stringy cartoon, that baryon would be three strings, each with a free end, with the strings attached to some sort of junction. This junction of three strings was called a &#8220;baryon vertex.&#8221;  If mesons are little strings, the fundamental objects in a string theory, what is the baryon vertex from the string theory point of view?!  Where is it hiding &#8212; what is it made of &#8212; in the mathematics of string theory?</p>

Thus, in a world with only gluons &#8212; a world whose strings naively form loops without ends &#8212; it must still be possible, with sufficient energy, to create a vertex-antivertex pair. Thus field theory predicts that these vertices <strong>must</strong> exist in closed string theories, though they are linearly confined.]</em></p>

<p>No one knew. But isn&#8217;t it interesting that the most prominent feature of this vertex is that it is a location <em><strong>where a string&#8217;s end can be trapped</strong>?</em></p>
<p>Everything changed in the period 1997-2000. Following insights from many other physicists, and using D-branes as the essential tool, Juan Maldacena finally made the connection between quantum field theory and string theory precise. He was able to relate strings with gravity and extra dimensions, which you can read about in Brian Greene&#8217;s books, with the physics of particles in just three spatial dimensions, similar to those of the real world, with only non-gravitational forces.  It was soon clear that the most ambitious and radical thinking of the &#8217;70s was correct &#8212; that almost every quantum field theory, with its particles and forces, can alternatively be viewed as a string theory. It&#8217;s a bit analogous to the way that a painting can be described in English or in Japanese &#8212; <em><strong>fields/particles and strings/gravity are, in this context, two very different languages for talking about exactly the same thing.</strong></em></p>
<p>The saga of the baryon vertex took a turn in May 1998, when <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9805112">Ed Witten showed how a similar vertex appears in Maldacena&#8217;s examples</a>. <em>[Note added: I had forgotten that two days after Witten&#8217;s paper, David Gross and Hirosi Ooguri submitted <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9805129v2">a beautiful, wide-ranging paper</a>, whose section on baryons contains many of the same ideas.]</em> Not surprisingly, this vertex was a D-brane &#8212; specifically a D-particle, an object on which the strings extending from freely-moving quarks could end. It wasn&#8217;t yet quite satisfactory, because the gluons and quarks in Maldacena&#8217;s examples roam free and don&#8217;t form mesons or baryons. Correspondingly the baryon vertex isn&#8217;t really a physical object; if you make one, it quickly diffuses away into nothing. Nevertheless, Witten&#8217;s paper made it obvious what was going on. <em>To the extent real-world mesons can be viewed as strings, real-world protons and neutrons can be viewed as <strong>strings attached to a D-brane</strong>.</em></p>

I don&#8217;t remember who found one first, but I do know that one of the earliest examples showed up in my first paper with Joe, in the year 2000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Working with Joe</strong></p>
<p>That project arose during my September 1999 visit to the KITP (Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics) in Santa Barbara, where Joe was a faculty member. Some time before that I happened to have studied a field theory (called <em>N=1*</em>) that differed from Maldacena&#8217;s examples only slightly, but in which meson-like objects do form. One of the first talks I heard when I arrived at KITP was by Rob Myers, about a weird property of D-branes that he&#8217;d discovered. During that talk I made a connection between Myers&#8217; observation and a feature of the N=1* field theory, and I had one of those &#8220;aha&#8221; moments that physicists live for. I suddenly knew what the string theory that describes the N=1*  field theory must look like.</p>
<p>But for me, the answer was bad news. To work out the details was clearly going to require a very difficult set of calculations, using aspects of string theory about which I knew almost nothing <em>[non-holomorphic curved branes in high-dimensional curved geometry.]</em> The best I could hope to do, if I worked alone, would be to write a conceptual paper with lots of pictures, and far more conjectures than demonstrable facts.</p>
<p>But I was at KITP.  Joe and I had had a good personal rapport for some years, and I knew that we found similar questions exciting. And Joe was the brane-master; he knew everything about D-branes. So I decided my best hope was to persuade Joe to join me. I engaged in a bit of persistent cajoling. Very fortunately for me, it paid off.</p>
<p>I went back to the east coast, and Joe and I went to work. Every week or two Joe would email some research notes with some preliminary calculations in string theory. They had such a high level of technical sophistication, and so few pedagogical details, that I felt like a child; I could barely understand anything he was doing. We made slow progress. Joe did an important warm-up calculation, but I found it really hard to follow. If the warm-up string theory calculation was so complex, had we any hope of solving the full problem?  Even Joe was a little concerned.</p>
<p><img class=" alignright" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSIgjqZN7VDuiTCjxMsnfwddwDFPEIvmKaTYqKdIU551Ed7xWJL" alt="Image result for polchinski joe" />And then one day, I received a message that resounded with a triumphant cackle &#8212; a sort of &#8220;we got &#8217;em!&#8221; that anyone who knew Joe will recognize. Through a spectacular trick, he&#8217;d figured out how use his warm-up example to make the full problem easy! Instead of months of work ahead of us, we were essentially done.</p>
<p>From then on, it was great fun! Almost every week had the same pattern. I&#8217;d be thinking about a quantum field theory phenomenon that I knew about, one that should be visible from the string viewpoint &#8212; such as the baryon vertex. I knew enough about D-branes to develop a heuristic argument about how it should show up. I&#8217;d call Joe and tell him about it, and maybe send him a sketch. A few days later, a set of notes would arrive by email, containing a complete calculation verifying the phenomenon. Each calculation was unique, a little gem, involving a distinctive investigation of exotically-shaped D-branes sitting in a curved space. It was breathtaking to witness the speed with which Joe worked, the breadth and depth of his mathematical talent, and his unmatched understanding of these branes.</p>
<p><em>[Experts: It&#8217;s not instantly obvious that the N=1* theory has physical baryons, but it does; you have to choose the right vacuum, where the theory is partially Higgsed and partially confining. Then to infer, from Witten&#8217;s work, what the baryon vertex is, you have to understand brane crossings (which I knew about from Hanany-Witten days): Witten&#8217;s D5-brane baryon vertex operator creates a  physical baryon vertex in the form of a D3-brane 3-ball, whose boundary is an NS 5-brane 2-sphere located at a point in the usual three dimensions. And finally, a physical baryon is a vertex with n strings that are connected to nearby D5-brane 2-spheres. See chapter VI, sections B, C, and E, of our paper from 2000.]</em></p>
<p>Throughout our years of collaboration, it was always that way when we needed to go head-first into the equations; Joe inevitably left me in the dust, shaking my head in disbelief. That&#8217;s partly my weakness&#8230; I&#8217;m pretty average (for a physicist) when it comes to calculation. But a lot of it was Joe being so incredibly good at it.</p>
<p>Fortunately for me, the collaboration was still enjoyable, because I was almost always able to keep pace with Joe on the conceptual issues, sometimes running ahead of him. Among my favorite memories as a scientist are moments when I taught Joe something he didn&#8217;t know; he&#8217;d be silent for a few seconds, nodding rapidly, with an intent look &#8212; his eyes narrow and his mouth slightly open &#8212; as he absorbed the point.  &#8220;Uh-huh&#8230; uh-huh&#8230;&#8221;, he&#8217;d say.</p>
<p>But another side of Joe came out in our second paper. As we stood chatting in the KITP hallway, before we&#8217;d even decided exactly which question we were going to work on, Joe suddenly guessed the answer! And I couldn&#8217;t get him to explain which problem he&#8217;d solved, much less the solution, for several days!! It was quite disorienting.</p>
<p>This was another classic feature of Joe. Often he <em>knew</em> he&#8217;d found the answer to a puzzle (and he was almost always right), but he couldn&#8217;t say anything comprehensible about it until he&#8217;d had a few days to think and to turn his ideas into equations. During our collaboration, this happened several times. (I never said &#8220;Use your words, Joe&#8230;&#8221;, but perhaps I should have.) Somehow his mind was working in places that language doesn&#8217;t go, in ways that none of us outside his brain will ever understand. In him, there was something of an oracle.</p>
<p><strong>Looking Toward The Horizon</strong></p>
<p>Our interests gradually diverged after 2006; I focused on the Large Hadron Collider <em>[also known as the Large D-brane Collider]</em>, while Joe, after some other explorations, ended up thinking about black hole horizons and the information paradox. But I enjoyed his work from afar, especially when, in 2012, Joe and three colleagues (Ahmed Almheiri, Don Marolf, and James Sully) blew apart the idea of <strong><em>black hole complementarity</em></strong>, widely hoped to be the solution to the paradox. [<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/black-holes/black-hole-information-paradox-an-introduction/">I explained this subject here</a>, and also mentioned <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/12/12/two-days-of-polchinski-puzzles/">a talk Joe gave about it here</a>.]  The wreckage is still smoldering, and the paradox remains.</p>
<p>Then Joe fell ill, and we began to lose him, at far too young an age.  One of his last gifts to us was <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09093">his memoirs</a>, which taught each of us something about him that we didn&#8217;t know.  Finally, on Friday last, he crossed the horizon of no return.  If there&#8217;s no firewall there, he knows it now.</p>
<p>What, we may already wonder, will Joe&#8217;s scientific legacy be, decades from now?  It&#8217;s difficult to foresee how a theorist&#8217;s work will be viewed a century hence; science changes in unexpected ways, and what seems unimportant now may become central in future&#8230; as was the path for D-branes themselves in the course of the 1990s.  For those of us working today, D-branes in string theory are clearly Joe&#8217;s most important discovery &#8212; though his contributions to our understanding of black holes, cosmic strings, and aspects of field theory aren&#8217;t soon, if ever, to be forgotten.  But who knows? By the year 2100, string theory may be the accepted theory of quantum gravity, or it may just be a little-known tool for the study of quantum fields.</p>
<p>Yet even if the latter were to be string theory&#8217;s fate, I still suspect it will be D-branes that Joe is remembered for. Because &#8212; as I&#8217;ve tried to make clear &#8212; they&#8217;re <em><strong>real</strong></em>.  Really real.  There&#8217;s one in every proton, one in every neutron. Our bodies contain them by the billion billion billions. For that insight, that elemental contribution to human knowledge, our descendants can blame Joseph Polchinski.</p>
<p>Thanks for everything, Joe.  We&#8217;ll miss you terribly.  You so often taught us new ways to look at the world &#8212; and even at ourselves.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the concepts that&#8217;s playing a big role in contemporary discussions of the laws of nature is the notion of &#8220;vacua&#8221;, the plural of the word &#8220;vacuum&#8221;. I&#8217;ve just completed <a title="Theories and Vacua" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/theories-and-vacua/" target="_blank">an article about what vacua are, and what it means for a universe to have multiple vacua, or for a theory that purports to describe a universe to predict that it has multiple vacua</a>. In case you don&#8217;t want to plunge right in to that article, here&#8217;s a brief summary of why this is interesting and important.</p>
<p>Outside of physics, most people think of a vacuum as being the absence of air. For physicists thinking about the laws of nature, &#8220;vacuum&#8221; means space that has been emptied of <em>everything</em> &#8212; at least, emptied of <strong><em>everything that can actually be removed</em></strong>. That certainly means removing all particles from it. But even though vacuum implies emptiness, it turns out that empty space isn&#8217;t really that empty. There are always fields in that space, fields like the electric and magnetic fields, the electron field, the quark field, the Higgs field. And those fields are always up to something.</p>
<p>First, all of the fields are subject to &#8220;<a title="Quantum Fluctuations and Their Energy" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/quantum-fluctuations-and-their-energy/" target="_blank">quantum fluctuations</a>&#8221; &#8212; a sort of unstoppable jitter that nothing in our quantum world can avoid.  <em>[Sometimes these fluctuations are referred to as <a title="Virtual Particles: What are they?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/virtual-particles-what-are-they/" target="_blank">&#8220;virtual particles&#8221;; but despite the name, those aren&#8217;t particles</a>.  Real particles are well-behaved, long-lived ripples in those fields; fluctuations are much more random.]</em> These fluctuations are always present, in any form of empty space.</p>
<p>Second, and more important for our current discussion, some of the fields <strong>may have average values that aren&#8217;t zero</strong>. [In our own familiar form of empty space, the <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">Higgs field has a non-zero average value</a>, one that causes many of <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the known elementary particles</a> to acquire a mass (i.e. a <a title="The Two Definitions of “Mass”, And Why I Use Only One" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/more-on-mass/the-two-definitions-of-mass-and-why-i-use-only-one/" target="_blank">rest mass</a>).] And it&#8217;s because of this that the notion of vacuum can have a plural: forms of empty space can differ, even for a single universe, if the fields of that universe can take different possible average values in empty space. If a given universe can have more than one form of empty space, we say that &#8220;it has more than one vacuum&#8221;.</p>
<p>There are reasons to think our own universe might have more than one form of vacuum &#8212; more than just the one we&#8217;re familiar with. It is possible that the Standard Model (the equations used to describe all of <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the known elementary particles, and all the known forces except gravity</a>) is a good description of our world, even up to much higher energies than our current particle physics experiments can probe. Physicists can predict, using those equations, how many forms of empty space our world would have. And their calculations show that our world would have (at least) two vacua: the one we know, along with a second, exotic one, with a much larger average value for the Higgs field. (Remember, this prediction is based on the assumption that the Standard Model&#8217;s equations apply in the first place.)  An electron in empty space would have a much larger mass than the electrons we know and love (and need!)</p>
<p>The future of the universe, and our understanding of how the universe came to be, might crucially depend on this second, exotic vacuum. <a title="Theories and Vacua" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/theories-and-vacua/" target="_blank">Today&#8217;s article</a> sets the stage for future articles, which will provide an explanation of why the vacua of the universe play such a central role in our understanding of nature at its most elemental.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Familiar throughout our international culture, the &#8220;Big Bang&#8221; is well-known as the theory that scientists use to describe and explain the history of the universe. But the theory is not a single conceptual unit, and there are parts that are more reliable than others.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to understand that the theory &#8212; a set of equations describing how the universe <em>(more precisely, the <strong><em>observable patch</em></strong> of our universe, which may be a tiny fraction of the universe)</em> changes over time, and leading to sometimes precise predictions for what should, if the theory is right, be observed by humans in the sky &#8212; actually consists of different periods, some of which are far more speculative than others.  In the more speculative early periods, we must use equations in which we have limited confidence at best; moreover, data relevant to these periods, from observations of the cosmos and from particle physics experiments, is slim to none. In more recent periods, our confidence is very, very strong.</p>
<p>In my <a title="History of the Universe" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/" target="_blank">&#8220;History of the Universe&#8221; article</a> <em>[see also my related articles on <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">cosmic inflation</a>, on the <a title="Hot Big Bang" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/hot-big-bang/" target="_blank">Hot Big Bang</a>, and on the <a title="Before Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/before-inflation/" target="_blank">pre-inflation period</a>; also a comment that <a title="Big Bang: Expansion, NOT Explosion" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/big-bang-expansion-not-explosion/" target="_blank">the Big Bang is an expansion, <strong>not</strong> an explosion!</a>]</em>, the following figure appears, though without the colored zones, which I&#8217;ve added for this post. The colored zones emphasize what we know, what we suspect, and what we don&#8217;t know at all.</p>

<p>Notice that in the figure, I don&#8217;t measure time from the start of the universe.  That&#8217;s because I don&#8217;t <em>know</em> how or when the universe started (and in particular, the notion that <a title="Did The Universe Really Begin With a Singularity?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/21/did-the-universe-begin-with-a-singularity/" target="_blank">it started from a singularity</a>, or worse, <a title="Big Bang: Expansion, NOT Explosion" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/big-bang-expansion-not-explosion/" target="_blank">an exploding &#8220;cosmic egg&#8221;</a>, is simply an over-extrapolation to the past and a misunderstanding of what the theory actually says.) Instead I measure time from the start of the <strong>Hot</strong> Big Bang in the observable patch of the universe.  <em>I also don&#8217;t even know precisely when the Hot Big Bang started, but the uncertainty on that initial time (relative to other events) is less than one second &#8212; so all the times I&#8217;ll mention, which are much longer than that, aren&#8217;t affected by this uncertainty.</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll now take you through the different confidence zones of the Big Bang, from the latest to the earliest, as indicated in the figure above.</p>
<p><span id="more-7537"></span></p>
<p><strong>The Green Zone: Confidence</strong></p>
<p>A key clue that the observable patch of the universe was once hot and dense, and cooling as it expanded &#8212; i.e. that there <em>was</em> a Hot Big Bang period (preceded perhaps by cosmic inflation, but we don&#8217;t need to focus on that yet) &#8212; is the presence in the universe of the cosmic microwave background [CMB]. From all parts of the sky, an easily detectable sea of electromagnetic radiation in the form of microwaves (photons with energy about 1000 times less than photons of visible light) is streaming across the universe, and onto the Earth. Not only is the CMB a broad clue as to the universe&#8217;s past, it is also a key tool for scientists to use in finding even more precise and focused clues. Much of the history of the observable patch is imprinted in the details of the CMB.</p>
<p>A prediction of the Hot Big Bang is that the microwaves are just a sign of past heat, and of nothing else. Specifically, if you measure the microwave photons&#8217; energy, and plot <em>the amount of energy</em> coming from a patch of sky due to photons <em>of a particular frequency</em>, you should see the same plot (a &#8220;black-body spectrum&#8221;, as it is called) as you would see for photons emitted by a cold piece of ice or rock or metal.  [Yes, ice at 2.7 degrees C above <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/01/07/happy-chilly-new-year/" target="_blank">absolute zero</a> does glow in microwaves.]  The fact that the COBE satellite&#8217;s data agrees closely with the prediction of a black-body spectrum (shown in the figure) is overwhelming evidence that there was a Hot Big Bang going on at the time that atoms first formed, when the observable patch of the universe became transparent to light &#8212; a time now believed to be about 380,000 years after the Hot Big Bang began.</p>

Data from the COBE satellite is the red crosses; the green curve is the prediction of a black-body spectrum.</p></div>
<p>The most powerful evidence that a simple view of the Hot Big Bang is correct even earlier is the success of the theory (i.e. equations) for nucleosynthesis: the formation of <a title="The Nuclei of Atoms: At the Heart of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-nuclei-of-atoms-at-the-heart-of-matter/" target="_blank">atomic nuclei</a> for the lightest atoms during the Hot Big Bang.  <em>(Note the atoms themselves formed hundreds of thousands of years later, when the temperature was cool enough for <a title="Electrons: On the Outskirts of Atoms" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/electrons-on-the-outskirts-of-atoms/" target="_blank">the nuclei to capture electrons</a>.)</em>  The equations of the Hot Big Bang include</p>
<ul>
<li>Einstein&#8217;s version of gravity and</li>
<li>the &#8220;quantum field theory&#8221; used to describe <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the known particles and non-gravitational forces.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These equations can be used to calculate how abundant certain light atoms should be, if there was a Hot Big Bang.  Specifically, one can compute the ratios of how much hydrogen <em>(normal <strong>and</strong> heavy [&#8220;deuterium&#8221;])</em>, helium <em>(normal [&#8220;helium-4&#8221;] <strong>and</strong> light [&#8220;helium-3&#8221;])</em>, and lithium should be present in pristine parts of the observable patch, if the atomic nuclei of those elements were mainly forged during the cooling stages of the Hot Big Bang. If the elements other than hydrogen were only formed in stars, then there should be very little helium and virtually no deuterium in the observable patch of the universe. (Deuterium is actually destroyed in stars.) But in a cooling Hot Big Bang, a lot of helium &#8212; about 1/4 of the amount of hydrogen &#8212; and a small but measurable amount of deuterium should be produced.</p>
<p>These predictions of the Hot Big Bang depend in great detail on our understanding of particle physics and gravity &#8212; <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">of the weak nuclear force, the strong nuclear force, the electromagnetic force, the gravitational force (in Einstein&#8217;s version of it) and on the properties of neutrinos, electrons, photons, protons and neutrons.</a> And the numbers work! The amount of helium, relative to ordinary hydrogen, is predicted to be in the 20 &#8211; 25% range; deuterium is predicted to be in the range of one part in 10,000 to 100,000, helium-3 a factor of 10 smaller than that, and lithium in the part per 10 billion range. The data agree!</p>

<p>That these predictions agree with observations of the distant cosmos (see the figure below) provides a strong argument that the Hot Big Bang really occurred, and was originally hot enough to break apart nuclei.  That means that temperatures were initially at least hot enough that the typical particle had an energy of about 0.001 <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/" target="_blank">GeV</a>, which would have happened a few minutes after the Hot Big Bang began.  More precise measurements even help us understand how much ordinary matter there is in the observable patch of the universe, with results that agree with other measurements of the same quantity.</p>
<p>For this reason, I&#8217;ve marked the nucleosynthesis period and what follows it in <span style="color:#008000;">green</span>, to emphasize that we have strong observational evidence that the Hot Big Bang did occur, and was so hot &#8212; hot enough to destroy atomic nuclei &#8212; that the atomic nuclei around us today had to form from scratch as the temperature cooled.</p>
<p><strong>The Yellow Zone: Extrapolating a Bit Using Particle Physics</strong></p>
<p>However, for times before nucleosynthesis, the arguments are weaker. We don&#8217;t have much direct evidence for what was taking place. But we have a lot of knowledge about particle physics, up to energies of a few hundred GeV, thanks to the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC] and its predecessors over the last few decades.  So if we assume that the Hot Big Bang started at temperatures so high that a typical particle would have had an energy of a few hundred <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/" target="_blank">GeV</a>, we can calculate the observable patch&#8217;s properties from that temperature downward. At such a high temperature,</p>

<p>As the temperature cooled, we can calculate <em>(now that <a title="Discovery of the Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-discovery-of-the-higgs/" target="_blank">we know the Higgs particle&#8217;s mass</a>, and if we assume there aren&#8217;t any lightweight particles that we don&#8217;t know about)</em> that first the Higgs field would have turned &#8220;on&#8221;, making the weak nuclear force henceforth weak; and then, a bit later, the strong nuclear force would have become very strong, so that quarks and gluons and anti-quarks would have been trapped henceforth and forever into <a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/" target="_blank">protons</a>, <a title="The Nuclei of Atoms: At the Heart of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-nuclei-of-atoms-at-the-heart-of-matter/" target="_blank">neutrons</a>, anti-protons and anti-neutrons, as well as other very short-lived <a title="What’s a Hadron?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-hadron-as-in-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">hadrons</a>.</p>
<p>However, we can&#8217;t yet directly confirm <em>by cosmological observation</em> that this is true.  It&#8217;s not entirely impossible that there was something odd and unknown about the universe that makes some of these conclusions premature. Someday we may be able to be more certain, but not yet. So in this time period, starting just before the Higgs field turns on and going until nucleosynthesis, we have a highly educated guess as to what was happening, though no direct experimental checks.  That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve marked this time period in <span style="color:#333333;">yellow</span>.</p>
<p><strong>The Orange Zone: What Started the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Hot</span> Big Bang?</strong></p>
<p>Even earlier? Well, at even higher temperatures we don&#8217;t know the particle physics with confidence; we&#8217;d need particle accelerators more powerful than the LHC.  To figure out what happened in the Big Bang in detail, we have to make assumptions about the particles available, without any way to check them. But still, we are not without information, because we do have an experimental probe: the CMB itself.</p>
<p>It is a remarkable fact that the CMB is incredibly uniform, to one part in 100,000. That&#8217;s already information, and explaining why it&#8217;s true is one of the arguments in favor of <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">cosmic inflation</a>.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s much, much more information in the <em>imperfections</em> in that uniformity. The non-uniformities, which were discovered by the COBE satellite, have been studied in detail by the WMAP and Planck satellites, along with many other experiments from the ground. And it was in studying the non-uniformities in the CMB and their tiny bit of polarization that BICEP2 made <a title="BICEP2: New Evidence Of Cosmic Inflation!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/bicep2-new-evidence-of-cosmic-inflation/" target="_blank">the big (but <del>unconfirmed</del> now discredited) discovery that was announced last week</a> (here&#8217;s some <a title="A Primer On Today’s Events" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/a-primer-on-todays-events/" target="_blank">background information on that discovery, in the form of FAQs, that you may find useful</a>).</p>
<p>The photons in the CMB are astonishingly sensitive. There are very few things that affect them, and fortunately, most of the things that do are relics from the extremely early periods of the observable patch of the universe. It&#8217;s an unexpected gift for scientists that this is true! The CMB photons were created about 380,000 years after the Hot Big Bang, and yet they give us insight into the entire period before that, all the way back to a period <em>just before</em> the Hot Big Bang!!!  (They also can give us important insights into what happened <em>after</em> 380,000 years, too.)  To me, this incredibly sensitivity of the CMB is one of the most amazing natural phenomena in all of science&#8230; and it has been the key to progress in cosmology in recent years.</p>
<p>Detailed measurements of the CMB have increasingly given us insight into the zone marked in orange, where we don&#8217;t have any particle physics data &#8212; just guesses, and calculations based on those guesses.  The reason insights have been possible is that our calculations rely on very general properties of the Hot Big Bang and the pre-Hot Big Bang period to make predictions.  What I mean by this is that these calculations begin with very simple assumptions about the patterns of non-uniformities that were present at the start of the Hot Big Bang, and then we check if these assumptions give predictions for non-uniformities in the CMB that agree with data.  They do!  This is shown in the figure below, where predictions of the Hot Big Bang theory, <em>with these simple assumptions about the starting point</em>, are compared with data from the Planck satellite. (Similar but less precise measurements were made before Planck, by WMAP and a number of ground-based experiments.)</p>

<p>Thus, simple assumptions about the non-uniformities at the start of the Hot Big Bang seem to be right, more or less.  This lends support to the hypothesis of cosmic inflation, which can produce simple non-uniformities. But it&#8217;s not convincing, because one can imagine simple non-uniformities arising in some other way.  There is at least one alternative &#8212; the ekpyrotic universe &#8212; that is also largely consistent with this data, and there might have been others that no one has thought of.  Meanwhile, there were many qualitatively different forms that cosmic inflation might take, some of which could have been consistent with universes quite different from those with a simple Big Bang.  For example, the data has been consistent with universes that, at temperatures a bit higher than reached in the yellow zone in the figure, have more spatial dimensions than the three we&#8217;re used to. So the number of possible options in the orange zone has been very large, and the degree of speculation involved has been very high.</p>

<p>This <del>may have changed</del> with <a title="BICEP2: New Evidence Of Cosmic Inflation!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/bicep2-new-evidence-of-cosmic-inflation/">BICEP2s new measurement,</a> which <del>gives</del> unfortunately did not give powerful new evidence for cosmic inflation through inflation&#8217;s generation of gravitational waves&#8230; assuming the measurement itself, and the interpretation of the measurement, both hold up over time.  <em>[The interpretation did not.]</em> Since a measurable amount of gravitational waves can only be produced, as far as we know, if a period of inflation occurred and was <a title="If It Holds Up, What Might BICEP2′s Discovery Mean?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/18/if-its-holds-up-what-might-bicep2s-discovery-mean/" target="_blank">driven by a <strong>very</strong> large amount of &#8220;dark `energy&#8217; &#8220;</a>, BICEP2&#8217;s result may rule out all known alternatives to inflation, and significantly narrow down the options for how inflation may have occurred, excluding many of the more radical options as well as many simple ones. As such, it may increase confidence in the inflation hypothesis to change the color of the orange zone to yellow, or even, as more measurements come in and become more precise, to green.  <em>[But it did not.]</em></p>
<p>However, let&#8217;s not jump to conclusions until the measurement is confirmed with more data and by other observing teams.  <em>[You see how important it is that I write these cautionary caveats in my articles.  I have seen many measurements come and go; the fraction that stick is much less than half.]</em></p>
<p><strong>The Red Zone: Scientific Guesswork</strong></p>
<p>But BICEP2 can really only tell us about <strong><em>the late stage and exit from inflation</em></strong>. If we go deep into the inflationary period and try to go earlier, into the red zone in the figure, we face two problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>we don&#8217;t have any experimental probes of this early time, and</li>
<li>we don&#8217;t know which particle physics and/or gravity equations we should be using.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not yet have any cosmological observations that access this time period; the CMB photons bring us back to the late stage of inflation, but not further. We cannot infer much yet from CMB measurements about the &#8220;inflaton&#8221; field (and its particle) that is supposed to play the dominant particle-physics role during inflation, and we have no idea what other types of fields it may interact with, so it is hard to be sure what type of process got inflation started. Meanwhile, theoretical physics doesn&#8217;t help much either. We can try assuming that string theory is the true theory of quantum gravity in our world, but if we do that, we still find the equations are hard to solve and give, at best, a variety of possibilities. And trying to work in greater generality, without assuming string theory, doesn&#8217;t help; the calculations are still ambiguous and difficult. This doesn&#8217;t stop theoretical physicists from making educated, scientific guesses &#8212; i.e., speculations backed with concrete equations and calculations. But until we get some data that allows us to distinguish the many possibilities, we can&#8217;t say for sure what was actually happening back then.</p>
<p>So if people tells you that the universe <em>started</em> in such and such a way, perhaps &#8220;<a title="Did The Universe Really Begin With a Singularity?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/21/did-the-universe-begin-with-a-singularity/" target="_blank">with a singularity</a>&#8221; or &#8220;with a quantum fluctuation out of nothing&#8221; or &#8220;in the Big Crunch (i.e. the collapse) of a previous phase of the universe&#8221;, remember that they&#8217;re telling you about the <span style="color:#ff0000;">red zone</span>. They&#8217;re neglecting to tell you that what they&#8217;re saying is pure theory, with neither an experiment to back it up nor a clear theoretical reason to believe their suggestion is unique and preferable over someone else&#8217;s alternative. Only a bit later in cosmic history, once we focus on the late stages of inflation, and forward in time from there to nucleosynthesis, do we have both data (cosmological observation and particle physics collisions) and reasonably reliable theory (Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity plus the Standard Model of particle physics). Our confidence grows as time moves forward, the observable patch of the universe cools, and physics becomes of a sort that we&#8217;ve tested in numerous experiments already.</p>
<p>From this, I hope that you can see that the Big Bang Theory really isn&#8217;t a single, undifferentiated structure.  The most reliable part of the theory is that there was, at one point, a <a title="Hot Big Bang" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/hot-big-bang/" target="_blank">Hot stage of the Big Bang</a>. (Some people call that the Big Bang, in fact.) If BICEP2&#8217;s measurement is accurate, and correctly interpreted, then the reliable portion of the theory may then include a period of <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">inflation that preceded</a> the Hot Big Bang. (Some people would call &#8220;inflation plus the Hot Big Bang&#8221; the &#8220;Big Bang&#8221;.) But anything before inflation is not in the least reliable&#8230; in particular, the notion that the universe&#8217;s heat and density increased <a title="Did The Universe Really Begin With a Singularity?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/21/did-the-universe-begin-with-a-singularity/" target="_blank">to the extent that Einstein&#8217;s equations have a singularity, presumably indicating that they&#8217;re not sufficient to describe what was going on, is an <em>assumption</em></a>. So that part of the Big Bang Theory may not survive the test of time. You should be prepared, as scientists are, to let it go.  After all, from 1960-1980 people had a vision of the early Big Bang that didn&#8217;t include something like inflation; their version was significantly adjusted as knowledge was gained, so why shouldn&#8217;t ours be?</p>
<p>Moreover, it is quite possible that the start of the universe, which people often refer to as the ultimate Big Bang, may not have had anything &#8220;Bang-ish&#8221; or even Big about it.  Yes, we might even need to let go someday of the idea that the universe truly <em>began</em> with a Big Bang. The scientific community won&#8217;t have any problem with this, because many of us have never taken that idea very seriously in the first place.  But what about the rest of our society, which seems to hold to this name and notion far harder than do scientists themselves, to the point of <em>(egad!)</em> naming a television show after it?!  The loss may be more shocking than necessary&#8230;</p>

<p>First things first.  As with all major claims of discovery, <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">considerable caution is advised until the BICEP2 measurement has been verified by some other experiment</span></strong>.   Moreover, even if the measurement is correct, <span style="color:#800080;"><strong>one should not assume that the interpretation in terms of gravitational waves and inflation is correct; this requires more study and further confirmation.</strong></span></p>
<p>The media <strong>is</strong> assuming BICEP2&#8217;s measurement is correct, and that the interpretation in terms of inflation is correct, but leading scientists are not so quick to rush to judgment, and are thinking things through carefully.  Scientists are cautious not just because they&#8217;re trained to be thoughtful and careful but also because <em><strong>they&#8217;ve seen many claims of discovery withdrawn or discredited</strong></em>; discoveries are made when humans go where no one has previously gone, with technology that no one has previously used &#8212; and surprises, mistakes, and misinterpretations happen often.</p>
<p>But in this post, I&#8217;m going to <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">assume</span> <span style="color:#ff9900;">assume</span> <span style="color:#0000ff;">assume</span></strong> that BICEP2&#8217;s results are correct, or essentially correct, and are being correctly interpreted.  Let&#8217;s <strong>assume</strong> that <em>[here&#8217;s <a title="A Primer On Today’s Events" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/a-primer-on-todays-events/" target="_blank">a primer on yesterday&#8217;s result that defines these terms</a>]</em></p>

<p>Well&#8230;<strong> <em>Wow&#8230;  </em></strong>They&#8217;d really be quite amazing.<span id="more-7493"></span></p>
<p>Would this story be bigger than the <a title="The Day of the Higgs!!!!  DISCOVERY!!! History Made!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/07/04/the-day-of-the-higgs/" target="_blank">discovery of the Higgs particle</a>?  Certainly <em><strong>at least as</strong></em> big.  To try to compare the two gets us into silly discussions; you can&#8217;t know the long-term implications of a discovery at or near the time it is made.  But the immediate list of implications would certainly be longer.</p>
<p><strong>Some Definitions</strong></p>
<p>Before I start: we&#8217;ll need some definitions, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/some-definitions-for-cosmology/" target="_blank">given in this article</a>, of:</p>
<ul>
<li>A unit of energy called GeV (roughly the mass-energy of a hydrogen atom)</li>
<li>The Planck energy, Planck mass and Planck length (processes involving the Planck energy or mass in a region the size of the Planck length will generally involve both quantum mechanics and gravity [&#8220;quantum gravity&#8221;])</li>
<li>The energy scale associated with dark energy (which is not quite the amount of dark energy &#8212; for one thing, despite the name, dark `energy&#8217; is actually an energy per unit volume.)</li>
</ul>
<p>If any of these is unfamiliar to you, you may want to read <a title="Some Definitions for Cosmology" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/some-definitions-for-cosmology/" target="_blank">that article</a> first and to have it handy, in another tab or window, to serve as a glossary.  You may also want to have my <a title="History of the Universe" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/" target="_blank">History of the Universe</a> or my <a title="A Primer On Today’s Events" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/a-primer-on-todays-events/" target="_blank">BICEP2 Discovery Primer</a> hand.</p>
<p><strong>Implications of BICEP2&#8217;s Discovery &#8212;</strong> <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">IF &#8230; IF &#8230;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">IF IF IF</span></strong> BICEP2&#8217;s measurement is correct, at least roughly, and <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">IF IF IF </span></strong>it is being correctly interpreted, at least roughly, then there&#8217;s a long list of broad implications that I can think of, or that others of my colleagues have pointed out to me in conversations.  Some of them are vague &#8212; areas where the implications are likely to be important but are not yet very clear.  Some of these things were already somewhat implied by the previous experimental successes of the theory of inflation, while some stem directly from BICEP2.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>IF &#8230; IF &#8230;</strong></span></p>
<p>A puzzle that bothered scientists for decades, as to how the observable patch of the universe (i.e. the part that we can actually observe today; the universe may be much, much larger than this &#8212; <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">see here</a>) could be so uniform, would indeed be firmly solved, by a period of <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">cosmic inflation</a>.  The extremely flat geometry of the universe would also now be firmly explained.</p>
<p>We would also have confirmation about how the universe became hot &#8212; about how the Hot Big Bang got started.  The picture would be this: a large amount of <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">dark energy first makes the universe big, via inflation, and then the dark energy turns into energetic particles, making the universe hot (and still expanding, albeit more and more slowly</a> [until <a title="A Nobel Prize That’s No Surprise" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/10/04/a-nobel-prize-thats-no-surprise/" target="_blank">relatively recently</a>]).  Some people like to say that inflation puts the &#8220;Bang&#8221; in &#8220;Big Bang&#8221;, but remember that it also makes the universe flat and uniform and huge (typically much larger than the observable patch) before it heats it up.</p>
<p>The existence of cosmic inflation would itself be another feather in the cap of Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity &#8212; since it is Einstein&#8217;s theory that predicts that the presence of a positive cosmological &#8220;constant&#8221; [not necessarily constant], also known as &#8220;dark `energy&#8217; &#8221; [not really energy, but energy density and negative pressure in just the right combination] actually causes the universe to expand, rather than (as we&#8217;d naively expect from gravity) contract.</p>
<p>And <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">(IF&#8230; IF&#8230;)</span></strong> the confirmation of cosmic inflation would mean that those who pointed it out and its advantages, and developed the idea &#8212; people like Starobinsky, Guth, Steinhardt, Linde &#8212; ought to be able to celebrate (though not all will do so, because they abandoned the idea&#8230;)</p>
<p>Also celebrating would be those who pointed out the possibility of a detectable signal from gravitational waves in the polarization of the CMB, which is what BICEP2 has apparently observed.  I believe these would be Kamionkowsi, Kosowsky, Stebbins, Seljak and Zaldarriaga (but the cosmologists should correct me if I&#8217;m unfair here.)</p>
<p>Were there any doubt left concerning Einstein&#8217;s prediction that gravitational waves exist &#8212; perhaps some leftover worry about the 1993-Nobel-Prize-winning indirect detection of energy carried being off by these waves, via <a href="http://www.astro.cardiff.ac.uk/research/gravity/tutorial/?page=3thehulsetaylor" target="_blank">precision measurements of a pulsar, one of a pair of closely-orbiting neutron stars</a> discovered by Hulse and Taylor &#8212; it would be over.</p>
<p>And if anyone still wasn&#8217;t sure that gravity is due to a spin-two field, not  a spin-zero field, the BICEP2 result would settle the matter; you can&#8217;t get B-mode polarization of the CMB without <a title="A Primer On Today’s Events" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/a-primer-on-todays-events/" target="_blank">combining the spin-two polarization structure of the gravitational waves with Thomson scattering</a>.</p>
<p>If there were any doubt that gravity is controlled, just like everything else, by quantum physics, it would erased; BICEP2&#8217;s observation would imply that just like other fields, which are subject to quantum jitter (i.e., random &#8220;<a title="Quantum Fluctuations and Their Energy" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/quantum-fluctuations-and-their-energy/" target="_blank">fluctuations</a>&#8220;), space and time <em>(somewhat more precisely, the metric that determines distances)</em> undergoes the same type of quantum fluctuations as other fields, fluctuations that <em>any</em> quantum version of Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity would predict.  No details about quantum gravity are needed for this conclusion.</p>
<p><span style="color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">The amount of dark energy required during inflation, in order that BICEP2 could observe this gravitational wave signal, would <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>(IF&#8230; IF&#8230;)</strong></span> be enormous.  The energy scale of dark energy [<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/some-definitions-for-cosmology/" target="_blank">defined here</a>] would be about 10<sup>16</sup> GeV, just about 100 times less than the absolute maximum possible, which is the (reduced) Planck scale.  This need not have been the case!   This energy scale  could have been trillions of times smaller, and yet still given acceptable amounts of inflation of the universe and an acceptable Hot Big BAng.  </span>Amazingly, the dark energy during inflation, if BICEP2 is right, is much larger than it <em>needed</em> to be, and almost as large as it could <em>possibly</em> be!</p>
<p><span style="color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">Moreover, if the energy scale of dark energy [<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/some-definitions-for-cosmology/" target="_blank">defined here</a>] had been just a few times weaker than BICEP2 observes &#8212; 1000 times less than the absolute maximum &#8212; then the gravitational wave signal would have been so faint that it would have been completely drowned out by another process (<a title="A Primer On Today’s Events" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/a-primer-on-todays-events/" target="_blank">lensing of E-mode polarization</a>, the solid red curve on the <a title="BICEP2: New Evidence Of Cosmic Inflation!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/bicep2-new-evidence-of-cosmic-inflation/" target="_blank">first figure here</a>.)  So most of us thought, with this wide range of possibilities, that it was a real long shot that BICEP2, or any future similar experiment, would ever see any signal due to gravitational waves from inflation.  That the gravitational waves would turn out to be large and powerful enough to be observed would be an amazing piece of luck for scientists wanting to understand the universe.  (<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">IF&#8230; IF&#8230;</span></strong>)</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff6600;"><em>[The original version of this paragraph overstated what we&#8217;d know; thanks to my colleagues for pointing out a blunder concerning the heating after inflation.]</em> </span> Also, this would mean we would now have an estimate for how hot the observable patch of the universe could have become <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">after inflation ended and the region containing the observable patch became very hot</a> &#8212; the start of the Hot Big Bang.  The energy scale of the dark energy during inflation determines the maximum possible temperature at the start of the Hot Big Bang, more or less.  To say it another way: after inflation with dark energy of scale 10<sup>16</sup> GeV ended, the universe would have become hot, potentially so hot that the average particle rushing around in the hot dense soup of particles had a motion-energy of 10<sup>16</sup> GeV, though perhaps quite a bit less than this.  That&#8217;s a maximum temperature of as much as 10<sup>29</sup> degrees [yes, that&#8217;s a 1 with 29 zeroes after it!!!]</p>
<p>The Large Hadron Collider&#8217;s data provide direct insights into physics at the energy scale of around 1000 GeV or so.  [The mass-energy mc² of the Higgs particle is 125 GeV.]  The BICEP2 measurement would arguably be our first direct evidence (<span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>IF&#8230; IF&#8230;</strong></span>) concerning physics at higher energy scales than the LHC <em>(though one could argue we have a little information from the existence of neutrino masses.)</em>  And not just a little higher!  Since the scale of the dark energy at inflation is at 10<sup>16</sup> GeV, we&#8217;re talking <strong>10,000,000,000,000 times higher</strong>!!!  We&#8217;ve been trying for years, using various methods, to find evidence concerning how physics works at or near the Planck energy and Planck length.  All previous efforts have come up with nothing; proton decay might have given us insight, but it is too rare if it happens at all; neutrino oscillations haven&#8217;t given a clear pictures; cosmology might have revealed big surprises concerning the Planck energy, but none have previously shown up.  But if BICEP2 is right, then, for the first time, we are seeing phenomena which occurred near this energy scale!</p>
<p>Similarly, data from cosmology has made us very confident that we understand physics in the early universe back to the time when the first <a title="The Nuclei of Atoms: At the Heart of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-nuclei-of-atoms-at-the-heart-of-matter/" target="_blank">atomic nuclei</a> formed during the Hot Big Bang &#8212; a few minutes after the Hot Big Bang started, when the temperature was such that the typical particles had energy of about 0.001 GeV.  And we have had <em>reasonable</em> confidence that we have a decent understanding, using what we&#8217;ve learned about particle physics recently, back to times of a billionth of a second, and temperatures corresponding to an energy of a hundred GeV or so.  But now our understanding may be taking (<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">IF&#8230; IF&#8230;</span></strong>) an enormous leap, back to the very start of the Hot Big Bang, at a temperature corrresponding to an energy of as much as 10<sup>16</sup> GeV, and even earlier, into the frigid inflating universe.</p>
<p>The success of the details of the equations that form the heart of inflationary theory suggests that not only did Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity describe physics at very early times and very high energy scales, the basic principles of quantum field theory worked back then too.  It could easily have been imagined &#8212; and many have imagined, with concrete ideas backed up with equations &#8212; that there might be important principles that we are unaware of, or modifications of the ones we know, that would give very different predictions from standard inflationary theory.  So far, there&#8217;s no sign of that at all.  BICEP2&#8217;s result (<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">IF&#8230; IF&#8230;</span></strong>) would be yet another sign that despite having done all our particle physics and gravity measurements at much lower energy scales and longer distances, those accessible to the LHC and to our previous experiments, we&#8217;ve actually understood the principles that govern the behavior of phenomena at much, much higher energy scales and much shorter distances!</p>
<p>The energy scale inferred from BICEP2&#8217;s measurement, 100 times smaller than the Planck energy &#8212; 10<sup>16</sup> GeV or so &#8212; has appeared in particle physics before!  If you take the three non-gravitational forces of nature &#8212; <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force and the electromagnetic force</a> &#8212; and you first consider <a title="The Known Particles — If The Higgs Field Were Zero" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/the-known-particles-if-the-higgs-field-were-zero/" target="_blank">how they are rearranged when the Higgs field is turned off, into strong nuclear, weak isospin, and hypercharge forces</a> &#8212; and then you look at <a title="The Strengths of the Known Forces" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-forces-of-nature/the-strength-of-the-known-forces/" target="_blank">how the strengths of the forces drift</a> as you study them at shorter and shorter distances and higher and higher energies, you find the forces all become about the same strength at an energy scale of about 10<sup>16</sup> GeV or so.  This is called &#8220;unification of coupling constants&#8221; (i.e. force strengths) &#8212; or, originally and more ambitiously, &#8220;grand unification&#8221;, a grander notion that the three non-gravitational forces are actually manifestations of just one type of force.  <em>[Unification of that unified force with gravity is yet another question; that&#8217;s what string theory might do, though string theory does not require grand unification be a separate process from the unification with gravity.]</em>  Originally, back around 1980, inflation was imagined to be associated with grand unification, and if so, would have an energy scale of about &#8230; yes, 10<sup>16</sup> GeV or so.  But that idea died out long ago as people learned more about both unification and inflation.  Yet now we must wonder: could that part of the original idea, in some vague way, have actually been right?</p>
<p>Over the years, scientists have invented a plethora of variations on how inflation might have, in detail, taken place.  BICEP2&#8217;s observation of a gravitational wave signature would sweep away most of them, leaving just a few.  (More will be invented in coming months, though!)  It also would sweep away some alternatives to inflation and many speculative ideas for how the universe might behave, or might at least have behaved at earlier times.  Despite &#8220;tension&#8221; (meaning mild disagreement) between BICPS2s current data and the Planck satellite&#8217;s data, a rather simple observable patch of universe, with rather simple laws of nature and a rather simple form of inflation, are consistent with what we know.</p>
<p>One of the variants of inflation that would be excluded by BICEP2&#8217;s data is the notion (admittedly long-shot anyway) that actually the Higgs field could play the role of the inflaton after all.   It turns out that no observably large gravitational wave signal would be expected if that were true.</p>
<p>BICEP2&#8217;s result would represent the first time that, without any theoretical speculation about quantum gravity, an experiment has <strong>forced</strong> us to consider processes involving physics at the Planck scale, where quantum gravity is important.  Specifically, for a variant of inflation to give such a large gravitational wave signal <em>relative</em> to the size of the other non-uniformities in the cosmic microwave background, the Planck energy scale becomes important.  The inflaton field, which (by definition) is the field whose stored &#8220;<a title="The Energy That Holds Things Together" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/the-energy-that-holds-things-together/" target="_blank">potential energy</a>&#8221; <strong>is</strong> the dark energy, must change by an amount close to or a bit larger than the Planck energy scale. <em>[Sorry for the necessary technical-speak here. </em><em>This whole business is inherently confusing for non-experts.  The dark energy <strong>may change or may not change at all</strong> while the inflaton field is changing; that&#8217;s a separate question.  What it means for a field like an inflaton to change by the Planck energy scale is that if a particle interacted with the inflaton field as strongly as it possibly could (the way the electron interacts with the Higgs field, but stronger), then as the inflaton field changed by an amount comparable to the Planck energy scale, the particle&#8217;s mass would change by an amount comparable to the Planck mass.]</em></p>
<p>An extremely simple possibility for inflation that would still be consistent with all the data <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">(IF&#8230; IF&#8230;)</span></strong> is just to have a spin-zero field (a bit like the <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">Higgs field</a>, but with important differences &#8212; no weak nuclear force effects, for instance) which has a mass and no substantial interactions with any other fields.  This is a model introduced by Andrei Linde; it&#8217;s amazingly simple.  Could it really be correct?</p>
<p>Among the other very simple ideas that are likely to feature prominently in discussions of the near future are ones involving a &#8220;pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson&#8221;, of a type often called an &#8220;axion&#8221;.  <em>[I wrote a little about this in the paragraph just below the figure within <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/03/26/cosmic-conflation-the-higgs-the-inflaton-and-spin/" target="_blank">this post about the Planck satellite and what it means for variants of inflation.</a>]</em>  One of the variants of inflation that is most consistent with both the Planck satellite and BICEP2  <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>(IF&#8230; IF&#8230;)</strong></span> is an idea called &#8220;natural inflation&#8221;, from 1990, due to Katherine Freese, Joshua Frieman and Angela Olinto.  [Here&#8217;s a <a href="http://ccdb5fs.kek.jp/cgi-bin/img/allpdf?199010350" target="_blank">pdf of the paper</a>.] Such a field has the feature that it is periodic (i.e., if you change it by enough, it comes back to itself, the way an angle that can only range from 0 to 2π.)  It also has the feature that its interactions with all other fields are rather weak.  When this field varies a lot, the dark energy associated with it varies by quite a bit less&#8230; so the field could vary by something approaching the Planck scale yet the energy scale of the dark energy could stay rather constant, at one percent of the Planck energy.</p>
<p>In order for this idea to really be consistent with quantum gravity, it might require some modification, of the sort was introduced in 2008 by Liam McAllister, Eva Silverstein, and Alexander Westphal, in which the axion is periodic with a larger range than you&#8217;d naively expect.  <em>[They did this work in the context of string theory, but I don&#8217;t believe that string theory specifically is necessary for the idea to work; it might work in other consistent quantum gravity theories, if there are any.]  </em>Expect to hear much more about axions.  [By the way, it&#8217;s long been suggested that dark matter itself could be made from a type of axion&#8230; but presumably not the same one&#8230;]</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">One last one which is the weakest of the set&#8230; In </span><a style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;" title="What if the Large Hadron Collider Finds Nothing Else?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/07/what-if-the-large-hadron-collider-finds-nothing-else/" target="_blank">a recent article</a><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">, I pointed out that if the Higgs particle discovered at the LHC turns out to be of the simplest possible type &#8212; a &#8220;</span><a style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;" title="The Standard Model Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/" target="_blank">Standard Model Higgs</a><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">&#8221; &#8212; then because this is &#8220;</span><a style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;" title="Naturalness and the Standard Model" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/naturalness/" target="_blank">unnatural</a><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">&#8221; <em>(in the sense of &#8220;highly non-generic&#8221;)</em> it might call into question fundamental conceptual issues, perhaps even the whole framework of quantum field theory.  But BICEP2&#8217;s measurement would seem to support the framework of quantum field theory in a world of three smooth spatial dimensions up to very high scales and very short distances, so that line of thinking would be disfavored. </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;color:#ff0000;"><strong>(IF&#8230; IF&#8230;) </strong></span><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">Of course, measurements of the Higgs particle are still in the early days &#8212; at this point we can only say the Higgs particle is roughly &#8220;</span><a style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;" title="From “Higgs-like Particle” to “Standard Model-like Higgs”" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/03/15/from-higgs-like-particle-to-standard-model-like-higgs/" target="_blank">Standard-Model-like</a><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">&#8221;</span><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;"> in type &#8212;  and maybe the Higgs will turn out to be more complex, or other new particles will show up at the LHC, possibly rendering the discussion moot.  But (for reasons I outlined in my Santa Barbara talk two weeks ago) having only the Standard Model, with the Higgs field turned on <em>just a little</em>, plus quantum gravity and an inflaton field (and plus something to explain dark matter and neutrino masses) would pose many grave conceptual problems, ones that anthropic reasoning would not address.  <em>[Experts: Anthropic reasoning can be used to argue why the cosmological constant might be small; it can be used to argue why there is a hierarchy between the Planck mass and the proton and electron masses; but it cannot easily be used, without huge and problematic assumptions, to argue why one would find just the Standard Model at the LHC, with one light scalar Higgs field and nothing else new.]</em> So I would tend to see the BICEP2 result <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>(IF&#8230; IF&#8230;)</strong></span> as a (rather weak!!) argument slightly in favor of supersymmetry and grand unification, with supersymmetry just a little out of reach of the LHC for some reason, or modified in some way to make it harder to observe than expected.  <em>[Experts: &#8220;mini-split&#8221; supersymmetry, which preserves quantum field theory, with unification of coupling constants at the grand unified energy scale, starts to look better than something more radical.]</em></span></p>
<p>Colleagues: what have I left out?  Eventually this post will be stored on this site as a reference article, so I&#8217;d like to make it complete.</p>
<p><strong>Final Remarks</strong></p>
<p>One more time I must remind you that we&#8217;re still some time away from trusting the BICEP2 result, and quite a long time from trusting the interpretation of the result in terms of inflation.   All of the implications I&#8217;ve mentioned are therefore provisional.   But the list is impressive, and there are probably more I have forgotten to mention, or are known to others but not to me, along with still others that haven&#8217;t yet been noticed by anyone.  So I don&#8217;t yet know if BICEP2&#8217;s measurement is right, or if inflation occurred and if it created the signal they observe, but I do know this: <strong><em>there&#8217;s a lot at stake</em></strong>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first day of <a href="http://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/activities/dbdetails?acro=joefest-c14" target="_blank">the conference celebrating theoretical physicist Joe Polchinski</a> (see also <a title="Celebrating a Great Brane" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/02/27/celebrating-a-great-brane/" target="_blank">yesterday&#8217;s post</a>) emphasized the broad impact of his research career.  Thursday&#8217;s talks, some on quantum gravity and others on <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/23/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions/" target="_blank">quantum field theory</a>, were given by</p>
<ul>
<li>Juan Maldacena, on his latest thinking on the relation between gravity, geometry and the entropy of quantum entanglement;</li>
<li>Igor Klebanov, on some fascinating work in which new relations have been found between some simple quantum field theories and a very poorly understood and exotic theory, known as Vassiliev theory (a theory that has more fields than a field theory but fewer than a string theory);</li>
<li>Raphael Bousso, on his recent attempts to prove the so-called &#8220;covariant entropy bound&#8221;, another relation between entropy and geometry, that Bousso conjectured over a decade ago;</li>
<li>Henrietta Elvang, on the resolution of a puzzle involving the relation between a supersymmetric field theory and a gravitational description of that same theory;</li>
<li>Nima Arkani-Hamed, about his work on the amplituhedron, a set of geometric objects that allow for the computation of particle scattering in various quantum field theories (and who related how one of Polchinski&#8217;s papers on quantum field theory was crucial in convincing him to stay in the field of high-energy physics);</li>
<li>Yours truly, in which I quickly reviewed my papers with Polchinski relating string theory and quantum field theory, emphasizing what an amazing experience it is to work with him; then I spoke briefly about my most recent <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC] research (<a title="Unexpected Decays of the Higgs Particle: What We Found" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/02/11/non-standard-model-higgs-particle-decays-what-we-found/" target="_blank">#1</a>,<a title="Where Stands Supersymmetry (as of 12/2013)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/where-stands-supersymmetry-122013/" target="_blank">#2</a>), and concluded with some provocative remarks about what it would mean if the LHC, having found the last missing particle of the Standard Model (i.e. <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">the Higgs particle</a>), finds nothing more.</li>
</ul>
<p>The lectures have been recorded, so you will soon be able to find them at the <a href="http://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/" target="_blank">KITP site</a> and listen to any that interest you.</p>
<p>There were also two panel discussions. One was about the tremendous impact of Polchinski&#8217;s 1995 work on <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part 9)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/02/26/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-9/" target="_blank">D-branes</a> on quantum field theory (including particle physics, nuclear physics and condensed matter physics), on quantum gravity (especially through black hole physics), on several branches of mathematics, and on string theory. It&#8217;s worth noting that every talk listed above was directly or indirectly affected by D-branes, a trend which will continue in most of Friday&#8217;s talks.  There was also a rather hilarious panel involving his former graduate students, who spoke about what it was like to have Polchinski as an advisor. (Sorry, but the very funny stories told at the evening banquet were not recorded. [And don&#8217;t ask me about them, because I&#8217;m not telling.])</p>
<p>Let me relate one thing that Eric Gimon, one of Polchinski&#8217;s former students, had to say during the student panel. Gimon, a former <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0212061" target="_blank">collaborator of mine</a>, left academia some time ago and now works in the private sector. When it was his turn to speak, he asked, rhetorically, &#8220;So, how does calculating partition functions in K3 orientifolds&#8221; <em>(which is part of what Gimon did as a graduate student)</em> &#8220;prepare you for the real world?&#8221; How indeed, you may wonder. His answer: &#8220;A sense of pertinence.&#8221; In other words, <strong><em>an ability to recognize which aspects of a puzzle or problem are nothing but distracting details, and which ones really matter and deserve your attention</em></strong>. It struck me as an elegant expression of what it means to be a physicist.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today and tomorrow I&#8217;m at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics, on the campus of the University of California at Santa Barbara, attending a conference celebrating the career of one of the world&#8217;s great theoretical physicists, Joe Polchinski. Polchinski has shown up on this website a couple of times already (<a title="Two Days of Polchinski Puzzles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/12/12/two-days-of-polchinski-puzzles/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a title="A Quantum Gravity and Cosmology Conference" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/16/a-quantum-gravity-cosmology-conference/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a title="Black Hole Information Paradox: An Introduction" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/black-holes/black-hole-information-paradox-an-introduction/" target="_blank">here</a>).  And <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part 9)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/02/26/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-9/" target="_blank">in yesterday&#8217;s post</a> (on string/M theory) I mentioned him, because of his game-changing work from 1995 on &#8220;D-branes&#8221;, objects that arise in string theory. His paper on the subject has over 2000 citations! And now it&#8217;s such a classic that people rarely actually cite it anymore, just as they don&#8217;t cite Feynman&#8217;s paper on Feynman diagrams; its ideas have surely been used by at least double that number of papers.</p>
<p>Polchinski&#8217;s also very well-known for his work on quantum gravity, black holes, cosmic <em>[i.e. astronomically large]</em> strings, and quantum field theory.</p>
<p>Between 2000 and 2006, I had the extraordinary privilege to write four papers with Polchinski, all of them aimed at clarifying the relationship between string theory and quantum field theory. This was the longest collaboration of my career, and a very successful one. Because of this, I have the honor to give one of the talks today at the conference. So I&#8217;m going to cut my post short now, and tell you more about what&#8217;s happening at the conference when my duty is done.</p>
<p>But I will perhaps tease you with one cryptic remark. Although D-branes arise in string theory, that&#8217;s not the only place you&#8217;ll find them.  As we learned in 1998-2000, there&#8217;s a perspective from which <a title="The Nuclei of Atoms: At the Heart of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-nuclei-of-atoms-at-the-heart-of-matter/" target="_blank">protons and neutrons</a> themselves are D-branes. From that point of view, we&#8217;re made out of these things.</p>
<p>Someday &#8212; not today &#8212; I&#8217;ll explain that comment. But it&#8217;s one of many reasons why Polchinski&#8217;s work on D-branes is so important.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I continue with <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/23/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions/" target="_blank">my series of posts</a> on fields, strings and predictions.</p>
<p>During the 1980s, as I discussed <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part 8)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/01/23/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-8/">in the previous post in this series</a>, string theorists learned that of all the possible string theories that one could imagine, there were only <strong>five</strong> that were mathematically consistent.</p>
<p>What they learned in the first half of the 1990s, culminating in early 1995, is that <em>all five string theories are actually little corners of a single, more encompassing, and still somewhat mysterious theory</em>. In other words, after 30 years of studying various types of theories with strings in them, they ended up with just <strong>one</strong>!</p>
<p>On the one hand, that sort of sounds like a flop &#8212; all that work, by all those people, over two decades, and all we got for our efforts was <em>one new theory</em>?</p>
<p>On the other hand, it&#8217;s very tempting to think that the reason that everyone ended up converging on the same theory is that <strong><em>maybe it&#8217;s the only consistent theory of quantum gravity!</em></strong> At this point there&#8217;s no way to know for sure, but so far there&#8217;s no evidence against that possibility.  Certainly its a popular idea among string theorists.</p>
<p>This unique theory is called &#8220;M theory&#8221; today; we don&#8217;t know a better name, because we don&#8217;t really know what it is. We don&#8217;t know what it describes in general. We don&#8217;t know a principle by which to define it. Sometimes it is called &#8220;string/M theory&#8221; to remind us that it is string theory in certain corners.</p>

<p>Note that M theory is very different in one key respect from quantum field theory.  As I described in <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part 2)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/24/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-2/">the second post in this series</a>, &#8220;quantum field theory&#8221; is the term that describes the general case; &#8220;<strong>a</strong> quantum field theory&#8221; is a specific example within the infinite number of &#8220;quantum field theor<strong>ies</strong>&#8221;. But there&#8217;s no analogue of this distinction for M theory. M theory is (as far as anyone can discern) a unique theory; it is <strong><em>both</em></strong> the general <em><strong>and</strong></em> the specific case.  There is no category of &#8220;M theor<strong>ies</strong>&#8221;. However, this uniqueness, while remarkable, is not quite as profound as it might sound&#8230; for a reason I&#8217;ll return to in a future post.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the relationship between the five apparently very different string theories that appear in M theory is similar to the surprising relationships among various field theories that <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part 7)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/11/20/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-7/" target="_blank">I described in this post</a>. It&#8217;s <strong><em>not at all obvious</em></strong> that each string theory is related to the other four&#8230; which is why it took some time, and a very roundabout route involving the study of black holes and their generalizations to black strings and black branes, for this relationship to become clear.</p>
<p>But as it did become clear, it was realized that &#8220;M theory&#8221; (or &#8220;string/M theory&#8221;, as it is sometimes called) is not merely, or even mainly, a theory of strings; it&#8217;s much richer than that. In one corner it is actually a theory with 10 spatial (11 space-time) dimensions; this is a theory with membranes rather than strings, one which we understand poorly. And in all of its corners, the theory has more than just strings; it has generalizations of membranes, called &#8220;branes&#8221; in general. <em>[Yes, the joke&#8217;s been made already; the experts in this subject had indeed been brane-less for years.]</em> Particles are zero-dimensional points; strings are one-dimensional wiggly lines; membranes are two-dimensional surfaces. In the ordinary <em>three</em> spatial dimensions we can observe, that&#8217;s all we&#8217;ve got. But in superstring theory, with <em>nine</em> spatial dimensions, one doesn&#8217;t stop there. There are three-dimensional branes, called three-branes for short; there are four-branes, five-branes, and on up to eight-branes. [There are even nine-branes too, which are really just a way of changing all of space. The story is rich and fascinating both physically and mathematically.] The pattern of the various types of branes &#8212; specifically, which ones are found in which corners of M theory, and the phenomena that occur when they intersect one another &#8212; is a fantastically elegant story that was worked out in the early-to-mid 1990s.</p>
<p>A brane on which a fundamental string can end is called a &#8220;D-brane&#8221;. <a title="Two Days of Polchinski Puzzles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/12/12/two-days-of-polchinski-puzzles/" target="_blank">Joe Polchinski</a> is famous for having not only co-discovered these objects in the 1980s but for having recognized, in mid-1995, the wide-ranging role they play in the way the five different string theories are related to each other. I still remember vividly the profound effect that <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9510017" target="_blank">his 1995 paper</a> had on the field. A postdoctoral researcher at the time, I was attending bi-weekly lectures by Ed Witten on the new developments of that year. I recall that at the lecture following Polchinski&#8217;s paper, Witten said something to the effect that everything he&#8217;d said in his presentations so far needed to be rethought. And over the next few months, it was.</p>

There are also D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8 and D9 branes, along with NS5-branes, but since they have more than two spatial dimensions I can&#8217;t hope to draw them. There are no strings or D-branes, but there are M2-branes and M5- branes, in the 11-dimensional corner of M theory. A D-brane is an object where a fundamental string can end; therefore, in the presence of D-branes, a closed string can break into an open string with both ends on a D-brane (center and right).</p></div>
<p>The fact that string/M theory is <em>more</em> than just a theory of strings is strikingly similar to something known about quantum field theory for decades. Although quantum field theory was invented to understand particles in the context of Einstein&#8217;s special relativity, it turns out that it often describes <em><strong>more</strong></em> than particles. Field theory in three spatial dimensions can have <a title="Jets: The Manifestation of Quarks and Gluons" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/jets-the-manifestation-of-quarks-and-gluons/" target="_blank">string-like objects</a> (often called &#8220;<a title="Jets: The Manifestation of Quarks and Gluons" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/jets-the-manifestation-of-quarks-and-gluons/" target="_blank">flux tubes</a>&#8221;) and membrane-like objects (often called &#8220;domain walls&#8221;) and particle-like blobs (&#8220;magnetic monopoles&#8221;, &#8220;baryons&#8221;, and other structures). The simplest quantum field theories &#8212; <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part 3)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/01/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-3/" target="_blank">those for which successive approximation works</a> &#8212; are mainly theories of particles.  But flux tubes and domain walls and magnetic monopoles, which can&#8217;t be described in terms of particles, can show up even in those theories. So the complexities of M theory are perhaps not surprising. Yet it took physicists almost two decades to recognize that &#8220;branes&#8221; of various sorts are ubiquitous and essential in string/M theory. (We humans are pretty slow.)</p>
<p>Notably, there are contexts in which M theory exhibits no string-like objects at all. It&#8217;s the same with particles and fields; simple field theories have particles, but most field theories aren&#8217;t simple, and many complicated field theories don&#8217;t have particles. It can happen that the particles that would be observed in experiments may have nothing to do with the fields that appear in the equations of the theory; this was something I alluded to <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part 7)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/11/20/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-7/" target="_blank">in this article</a>. I also earlier <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part 2)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/24/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-2/" target="_blank">described scale-invariant quantum field theories</a>, which don&#8217;t have particles. Quantum field theories on curved space-time don&#8217;t have simple, straightforward notions of particles either. Quantum field theory is complex and rich and subtle, and we don&#8217;t fully understand it; I wrote seven posts about it in this series, and did little more than scratch the surface. String/M theory is even more complicated, so it will surely be quite a while before we understand it. But specifically, what this means is that what I told you <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part 8)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/01/23/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-8/" target="_blank">in my last article</a> about &#8220;simple superstring theories&#8221; is simply not always true. And that means that the first &#8220;<a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part 8)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/01/23/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-8/" target="_blank">vague prediction of string theory</a>&#8221; that I described might not be reliable&#8230; no more than <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part 2)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/24/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-2/" target="_blank">overall predictions of simple field theory</a>, all of which are true in the context of simple field theories, but some of which are often false in more complex ones.</p>
<p>By the way, those of you who&#8217;ve read about string theory may wonder: where is <a title="Supersymmetry" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/" target="_blank">supersymmetry</a> in my discussion? Historically, in all these developments, the mathematics and physics of supersymmetry played an important role in making it <em>easier to study and confirm the existence</em> of these branes within string/M theory. However, the branes are present in the theory even when supersymmetry isn&#8217;t exact. One must not confuse the technically useful role of supersymmetry in clarifying how string/M theory works for a requirement that supersymmetry has to be an exact (or nearly-exact) symmetry for string/M theory to make sense at all. It&#8217;s just a lot harder to study string/M theory in the absence supersymmetry&#8230; something which is also true, though to a somewhat lesser extent, of quantum field theory.</p>
<p><em>To be continued&#8230; next, how are quantum field theory and M theory similar and different?</em></p>

			<media:title type="html">Fig. 1: M theory is a set of equations that, depending on how they are used, can describe all known consistent  string theories and 11-dimensional supergravity, as well as many more complex and harder to understand things.  Only at the corners does it give the relatively simple string theories described in my previous post.</media:title>
