										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Last Thursday, <a href="https://muon-g-2.fnal.gov/">an experiment reported</a> that the magnetic properties of the muon, the electron&#8217;s middleweight cousin, are a tiny bit different from what particle physics equations say they should be.  All around the world, the headlines screamed: <strong>PHYSICS IS BROKEN!!!</strong> And indeed, it&#8217;s been pretty shocking to physicists everywhere. For instance, my equations are working erratically; many of the calculations I tried this weekend came out upside-down or backwards.  Even worse, my stove froze my coffee instead of heating it, I just barely prevented my car from floating out of my garage into the trees, and my desk clock broke and spilled time all over the floor.  What a mess!</p>



<p>&#8212;</p>



<p>Broken, eh?  When we say a coffee machine or a computer is broken, it means it doesn&#8217;t work. It&#8217;s unavailable until it&#8217;s fixed.  When a glass is broken, it&#8217;s shattered into pieces.  We need a new one. I know it&#8217;s cute to say that so-and-so&#8217;s video &#8220;broke the internet.&#8221;  But aren&#8217;t we going a little too far now?  Nothing&#8217;s broken about physics; it works just as well today as it did a month ago.</p>



<p>More reasonable headlines have suggested that &#8220;the laws of physics have been broken&#8221;. That&#8217;s better; I know what it means to break a law.  (Though the metaphor is imperfect, since if I were to break a state law, I&#8217;d be punished, whereas if an object were to break a fundamental law of physics, that law would have to be revised!)  But as is true in the legal system, not all physics laws, and not all violations of law, are equally significant.  </p>



<p>What&#8217;s a physics law, anyway? Crudely, physics is a strategy for making predictions about the behavior of physical objects, based on a set of equations <em>and</em> a conceptual framework for using those equations.  Sometimes we refer to the equations as laws; sometimes parts of the conceptual framework are referred to that way.  </p>



<p>But that story has layers.   Physics has an underlying conceptual foundation, which includes the pillar of quantum physics and its view of reality, and the pillar of Einstein&#8217;s relativity and its view of space and time.  (There are other pillars too, such as those of statistical mechanics, but let me not complicate the story now.) That foundation supports many research areas of physics.  Within particle physics itself, these two pillars are combined into a more detailed framework, with concepts and equations that go by the name of &#8220;quantum effective field theory&#8221; (&#8220;QEFT&#8221;).  But QEFT is still very <strong>general</strong>; this framework can describe an enormous number of possible universes, most with completely different particles and forces from the ones we have in our own universe.  We can start making predictions for real-world experiments only when we put the electron, the muon, the photon, and all the other familiar particles and forces into our equations, building up a <strong>specific</strong> example of a QEFT known as &#8220;<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/">The Standard Model of particle physics</a>.&#8221;  </p>



<p>All along the way there are equations and rules that you might call &#8220;laws.&#8221;  They too come in layers.  The Standard Model itself, as a specific QEFT, has few high-level laws: there are no principles telling us why quarks exist, why there is one type of photon rather than two, or why the weak nuclear force is so weak.  The few laws it does have are mostly low-level, true of our universe but not essential to it.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m bringing attention to these layers because an experiment might cause a problem for one layer but not another.   I think you could only fairly suggest that &#8220;physics is broken&#8221; if data were putting a foundational pillar of the entire field into question.  And to say &#8220;the laws of physics have been violated&#8221;, emphasis on the word &#8220;<strong>the</strong>&#8220;, is a bit melodramatic if the only thing that&#8217;s been violated is a low-level, dispensable law.</p>



<p>&#8212;</p>



<p>Has physics, as a whole, <strong>ever</strong> broken?  You could argue that Newton&#8217;s 17th century foundation, which underpinned the next two centuries of physics, broke at the turn of the 20th century.   Just after 1900, Newton-style equations had to be replaced by equations of a substantially different type; the ways physicists used the equations changed, and the concepts, the language, and even the goals of physics changed. For instance, in Newtonian physics, you can predict the outcome of any experiment, at least in principle; in post-Newtonian quantum physics, you often can only predict the probability for one or another outcome, even in principle. And in Newtonian physics we all agree what time it is; in Einsteinian physics, different observers experience time differently and there is no universal clock that we all agree on.  These were immense changes in the foundation of the field.</p>



<p>Conversely, you could also argue that physics didn&#8217;t break; it was just remodeled and expanded.  No one who&#8217;d been studying steam engines or wind erosion or electrical circuit diagrams had to throw out their books and start again from scratch.  In fact this &#8220;broken&#8221; Newtonian physics is still taught in physics classes, and many physicists and engineers never use anything else.  If you&#8217;re studying the physics of weather, or building a bridge, Newtonian physics is just fine. The fact that Newton-style equations are an <strong>incomplete</strong> description of the world &#8212; that there are phenomena they can&#8217;t describe properly &#8212; doesn&#8217;t invalidate them when they&#8217;re applied within their wheelhouse.</p>



<p>No matter which argument you prefer, it&#8217;s hard to see how to justify the phrase &#8220;physics is broken&#8221; without a profound revolution that overthrows foundational concepts.  It&#8217;s rare for a serious threat to foundations to arise suddenly, because few experiments can single-handedly put fundamental principles at risk.  <em>[The infamous case of the &#8220;faster-than-light neutrinos&#8221; provides an exception.  Had that experiment been correct, it would have invalidated Einstein&#8217;s relativity principles. But few of us were surprised when <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/neutrinos-faster-than-light/opera-what-went-wrong/">a glaring error turned up</a>.]</em></p>



<p>&#8212;</p>



<p>In the Standard Model, the electron, muon and tau particles (known as the &#8220;charged leptons&#8221;) are all identical except for their masses. <em>(More fundamentally, they have different interactions with <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/">the Higgs field</a>, from which their rest masses arise.)</em>  This almost-identity is sometimes stated as a &#8220;principle of lepton universality.&#8221;  <strong><em>Oh, wow, a principle &#8212; a law!</em></strong>  But here&#8217;s the thing.  Some principles are enormously important; the principles of Einsteinian relativity determine how cause and effect work in our universe, and you can&#8217;t drop them without running into big paradoxes.  Other principles are weak, and could easily be discarded without making a mess of any other part of physics.  The principle of lepton universality is one of these.   In fact, if you extend the Standard Model by adding new particles to its equations, it can be difficult to <em>avoid</em> ruining this fragile principle.  <em>[In a sense, the Higgs field has already violated the principle, but we don&#8217;t hold that against it.]</em></p>



<p>All the fuss is about a new experimental result which confirms an older one and slightly disagrees with the latest theoretical predictions, which are made using the Standard Model&#8217;s equations.  What could be the cause of the discrepancy?  One possibility is that it arises from a previously unknown difference between muons and electrons &#8212; from a violation of the principle of lepton universality.  For those who live and breathe particle physics, breaking lepton universality would be a big deal; there&#8217;d be lots of adventure in trying to figure out which of the many possible extensions of the Standard Model could actually explain what broke this law. That&#8217;s why the scientists involved sound so excited.  </p>



<p>But the failure of  lepton universality wouldn&#8217;t come as a huge surprise. From certain points of view, the surprise is that the principle has survived this long!  Since this low-level law is easily violated, its demise may not lead us to a profound new understanding of the world. It&#8217;s way too early for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/07/science/particle-physics-muon-fermilab-brookhaven.html">headlines that argue that what&#8217;s at stake is the existence of &#8220;forms of matter and energy vital to the nature and evolution of the cosmos.&#8221;</a> No one can say how much is at stake; it might be a lot, or just a little.</p>



<p>In particular, there&#8217;s absolutely <em>no</em> evidence that <strong><em>physics</em></strong> is broken, or even that <strong><em>particle physics</em></strong> is broken.  The pillars of physics and QEFT are not (yet) threatened.  Even to say that &#8220;<strong><em>the Standard Model </em></strong>might be broken&#8221; seems a bit melodramatic to me.  Does adding a new wing to a house require &#8220;breaking&#8221; the house? Typically you can still live in the place while it&#8217;s being extended. The Standard Model&#8217;s many successes suggest that it might survive largely intact as a recognizable part of a larger, more complete set of equations.</p>



<p>In any case, right now it&#8217;s still too early to say <strong>anything</strong> so loudly.  The apparent discrepancy may not survive the heavy scrutiny it is coming under. There&#8217;s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2021/04/08/why-you-should-doubt-new-physics-from-the-latest-muon-g-2-results/?sh=4443b8616c4b">plenty of controversy</a> about the theoretical prediction for muon magnetism; the required calculation is extraordinarily complex, elaborate and difficult.  </p>



<p>So, from my perspective, the headlines of the past week are way over the top.  The idea that a single measurement of the muon&#8217;s magnetism could &#8220;<a href="https://www.livescience.com/muon-wobble-could-break-physics.html">shake physics to its core</a>&#8220;, as claimed in another headline I happened upon, is amusing at best.   Physics, and its older subdisciplines, have over time become very difficult to break, or even shake.  That&#8217;s the way it should be, when science is working properly.  And that&#8217;s why we can safely base the modern global economy on scientific knowledge; it&#8217;s unlikely that a single surprise could instantly invalidate large chunks of its foundation.</p>



<p>Some readers may view the extreme, click-baiting headlines as harmless.  Maybe I&#8217;m overly concerned about them. But don&#8217;t they implicitly suggest that one day we will suddenly find physics &#8220;upended&#8221;, and in need of a complete top-to-bottom overhaul?  To imply physics can &#8220;break&#8221; so easily makes a mockery of science&#8217;s strengths, and obscures the process by which scientific knowledge is obtained.  And how can it be good to claim &#8220;physics is broken&#8221; and &#8220;the laws of physics have been broken&#8221; over and over and over again, in stories that almost never merit that level of hype and eventually turn out to have been much ado about nada?  The constant manufacturing of scientific crisis cannot possibly be lost on readers, who I suspect are becoming increasingly jaded.   At some point readers may become as skeptical of science journalism, and the science it describes, as they are of advertising; <em>it&#8217;s all lies, so <strong>caveat emptor</strong></em>.   That&#8217;s not where we want our society to be.  As we are seeing in spades during the current pandemic, there can be serious consequences when &#8220;<strong>TRUST IN SCIENCE IS BROKEN!!!</strong>&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8212;</p>



<p><em>A final footnote: Ironically, the Standard Model itself poses one of the biggest threats to the framework of QEFT. The discovery of the Higgs boson <strong>and nothing else (so far)</strong> at the Large Hadron Collider poses a conceptual challenge &#8212; the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/naturalness/">&#8220;naturalness&#8221; problem</a>. There&#8217;s no sharp paradox, which is why I can&#8217;t promise you that the framework of QEFT will someday break if it isn&#8217;t resolved. But the breakdown of lepton universality might someday <strong>help</strong> solve the naturalness problem, by requiring a more &#8220;natural&#8221; extension of the Standard Model, and thus might actually <strong>save</strong> QEFT instead of &#8220;breaking&#8221; it.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is beyond belief that not only am I <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2018/02/05/a-brilliant-light-disappears-over-the-horizon-in-memory-of-joe-polchinski/">again writing a post about the premature death of a colleague whom I have known for decades</a>, but that I am doing it about two of them.</p>
<p>Over the past weekend, two of the world&#8217;s most influential and brilliant theoretical high-energy physicists &#8212; Steve Gubser of Princeton University and Ann Nelson of the University of Washington &#8212; fell to their deaths in separate mountain accidents, one in the Alps and one in the Cascades.</p>
<p>Theoretical high energy physics is a small community, and within the United States itself the community is tiny.  Ann and Steve were both justifiably famous and highly respected as exceptionally bright lights in their areas of research. Even for those who had not met them personally, this is a stunning and irreplaceable loss of talent and of knowledge.</p>
<p>But most of us did know them personally.  For me, and for others with a personal connection to them, the news is devastating and tragic. I encountered Steve when he was a student and I was a postdoc in the Princeton area, and later helped bring him into a social group where he met his future wife (a great scientist in her own right, and a friend of mine going back decades).  As for Ann, she was one of my teachers at Stanford in graduate school, then my senior colleague on four long scientific papers, and then my colleague (along with her husband David B. Kaplan) for five years at the University of Washington, where she had the office next to mine. I cannot express what a privilege it always was to work with her, learn from her, and laugh with her.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have the heart or energy right now to write more about this, but I will try to do so at a later time. Right now I join their spouses and families, and my colleagues, in mourning.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m still kind of exhausted from the effort (<a title="Our Survey of Exotic Decays of the Higgs is Done" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/12/19/our-survey-of-exotic-higgs-decays-is-done/" target="_blank">see yesterday&#8217;s post</a>) of completing our survey of some of the many unexpected ways that the newly discovered <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">Higgs particle</a> might decay. But I would be remiss if, before heading off into the holiday break, I didn&#8217;t issue some well-deserved congratulations.</p>
<p><div style="width: 309px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img alt="" src="https://i2.wp.com/news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/71757000/jpg/_71757703_020360764-1.jpg" width="299" height="217" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The Jade Rabbit rover on the surface of the Moon, 15 December. Credit:Xinhua</p></div></p>
<p>Congratulations, first, to China &#8212; to the scientists and engineers who&#8217;ve managed to put a lander and a rover on the Moon. If you think that&#8217;s easy&#8230; think again! And they succeeded on their first attempt, a real coup. Now let&#8217;s see what science they can do with it, exploring a region of the Moon that apparently may offer answers to important questions about the Moon&#8217;s history. Specifically, by accident or by design, <a href="http://blogs.airspacemag.com/moon/" target="_blank">the rover is going to be able to explore an area of considerable geological importance</a>, involving one of the Moon&#8217;s giant lava flows, a relatively young one (1-2.5 billion years rather than 3 billion or more).</p>
<p><div style="width: 273px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img alt="" src="https://i2.wp.com/sci.esa.int/science-e-media/img/29/Gaia_liftoff_12_625.jpg" width="263" height="394" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Soyuz VS06, with Gaia, lifted off from Europe&#8217;s Spaceport, French Guiana, on 19 December 2013. Copyright: ESA &#8211; S. Corvaja, 2013</p></div></p>
<p>Congratulations, next, to the scientists and engineers of the European Union, who&#8217;ve put a fantastic telescope into space, destined to orbit the sun. The Gaia mission is aimed at doing the extraordinary: mapping, with ultra-high precision, the locations and motions of no less than 1 billion stars within our galaxy &#8212; nearly 1% of the total number. The distance to each of these stars will be determined by <a title="Parallax: Seeing in Depth" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/parallax-seeing-in-depth/" target="_blank">parallax</a> &#8212; looking at how the positions of stars wobble, from the perspective of the spacecraft as it orbits the sun &#8212; and the real motions of the stars will be determined by how they drift across the sky, and by the <a href="http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/doppler.htm" target="_blank">Doppler effect</a> for light.  This wealth of information will help scientists figure out the shape and history of the galaxy to a degree never previously possible.  Meanwhile, Gaia will also be able to do a lot of other science, picking up distant supernovas outside our galaxy, nearby asteroids orbiting our sun, and signs of planets around other stars, as well as brown dwarfs (small failed stars) that may be floating around between the stars. Gaia can even check some aspects of Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity! <a href="http://sci.esa.int/gaia/28890-objectives/" target="_blank">Read here</a> about all the wonderful things this mission can do.</p>
<p>Congratulations also to the scientists and engineers in Iran, who&#8217;ve apparently moved their rocketry program, and its potential application to human space flight, among other things, another step forward. A second monkey has made the trip to the edge of space, a suborbital trip. (Did the first survive? it&#8217;s not clear, and admittedly Iran is known for photo-shopping reality into supporting the story it wants to tell. Not that it matters; <a href="http://history.nasa.gov/animals.html" target="_blank">it took the US several tries</a>, back over 60 years ago, before a monkey survived the trip, and the survival rate continued to be poor for a while. )  Anyway, it puts Iran well on its way toward its goal of a human in space by 2018.</p>
<p>And finally, congratulations to my own country, the United States, for having <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/18/us-usa-fiscal-idUSBRE9BF1FW20131218" target="_blank">passed a budget deal.</a> Not out of the woods yet, but at least it was bipartisan, and we&#8217;re not yet talking about <a title="Help!

<p><em>My own view? Our uncontrolled experiments on our one and only planet must be curbed.  Scientific evidence from many quarters show definitively that the Earth is warming.  Science can give us arguments, strong but not airtight, that we may be responsible (mainly via carbon emissions, and the greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide).  It cannot tell us reliably how bad the risks of a warmer Earth will be; there are too many uncertainties.  But it seems to me that these are risks we shouldn&#8217;t be taking, period.  We don&#8217;t get to mail-order another planet if we mess this one up.</em></p>

<p>There&#8217;s been a lot of reporting recently on a puzzle in particle physics that I haven&#8217;t previously written about. There have been two attempts, a preliminary one in 2010 and <a href="http://www.psi.ch/media/proton-size-puzzle-reinforced" target="_blank">a more detailed one reported just this month</a>, to measure the size of a proton by studying the properties of an exotic atom, called &#8220;muonic hydrogen&#8221;. Similar to <a title="Atoms: Building Blocks of Molecules" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/atoms-building-blocks-of-molecules/" target="_blank">hydrogen</a>, which consists of a proton orbited by an <a title="Electrons: On the Outskirts of Atoms" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/electrons-on-the-outskirts-of-atoms/" target="_blank">electron</a> (Figure 1), this atom consists of a <a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/" target="_blank">proton</a> and a short-lived heavy cousin of the electron, called the <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">muon</a> (Figure 2). A muon, as far as we have ever been able to tell, is just like an electron in all respects except that it is heavier; more precisely, <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the electromagnetic force and the strong and weak nuclear force</a> treat electrons and muons in exactly the same way. Only the first two of these forces should play a role in atoms (and neither gravity nor any force due to the <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">Higgs field</a> should matter either). So because we have confirmed our understanding of ordinary hydrogen with very high precision, we believe we also understand muonic hydrogen very well also.  But something&#8217;s amiss.<span id="more-5502"></span></p>

The forces holding the atom together are the same, but the larger mass of the muon makes the atom smaller, and more sensitive to the (still relatively tiny) size of the proton.</p></div></p>
<p>Since the muon is about 200 times heavier than the electron, muonic hydrogen is about 200 times smaller (across) than ordinary hydrogen.  <em>[For an argument as to why, see the end of <a title="Atoms: Their Inner Workings" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/atoms-building-blocks-of-molecules/atoms-their-inner-workings/" target="_blank">this article</a>.]</em> And so the proton, which has a diameter about 60,000 times smaller than ordinary hydrogen, is only <strong>300</strong> times smaller than muonic hydrogen. That makes the details of muonic hydrogen more sensitive to the proton&#8217;s size, and thus allows for a more precise measurement.<br />
<em> </em></p>
<p>How is this done? On the experimental side, the experimenters use a laser whose energy per photon can be adjusted, and they measure the energy of photons needed to make muonic hydrogen transition from one state to another (similar to what is shown in Figure 3).<em> [In quantum mechanics, atoms and other similar systems can only exist in very particular states, each one with a very particular mass, shape, size, and other properties.]</em> Only photons of precisely the right energy will do the job for a particular transition. On the theoretical side, one uses known properties of protons, muons, and electromagnetic forces, etc., and (treating the proton&#8217;s size as completely unknown) one calculates carefully what the energy of the required laser photons is expected to be.  The answer depends on the proton&#8217;s unknown size, so by requiring the calculation agrees with the measurement, one learns what the proton&#8217;s size is! Or rather, one learns this <em>as long as one assumes</em></p>
<ul>
<li>the measurement was done accurately,</li>
<li>the calculation contains no errors,</li>

(The state of lowest energy is called the &#8220;ground&#8221; state; all others are called &#8220;excited states.)  The same technique works for a muonic atom. Specific transitions (not shown) have been used in the case of muonic hydrogen, while many different transitions have been used for ordinary hydrogen.</p></div></p>
<p>The reason for the recent excitement is that a similar technique for measuring the proton&#8217;s size has been used many times for transitions between states of ordinary hydrogen, and <strong><em>it gives a different answer</em></strong>. It is far less precise, but has been done many different ways, so the average of all the different measurements is estimated to be only 10 times less precise than the new measurements in muonic hydrogen. The value for the proton&#8217;s size obtained from ordinary hydrogen is <strong>about 4% larger</strong> than obtained from muonic hydrogen.  This is illustrated in Figure 4, which is taken from <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1301.0905" target="_blank">a recent useful review article on the subject by Pohl, Gilman, Miller and Pachucki.</a> <em>[Note I have abridged their caption.] </em> More specifically, the measurements based on transitions between states of ordinary hydrogen give an average proton radius of about 0.88 fermi <em>(where a &#8220;fermi&#8221; = femtometer is a quadrillionth of a meter = a thousandth of a millionth of a millionth of a meter = 10</em><sup>-15</sup><em> meters &#8212; and a meter is about 39 inches.</em>) The uncertainty on this result is claimed to be 0.01 fermi.  The measurements based on muonic hydrogen transitions give an answer of 0.84 fermi, with a much smaller uncertainty.  Precise numbers (valid before the recent improved muon-based result) are given in Figure 4.<em><br />

<p>Meanwhile, there&#8217;s another strategy for measuring the proton&#8217;s size, using high-energy electrons which fly into hydrogen gas and occasionally scatter off the protons deep within the hydrogen atoms (Figure 5.) By looking at the pattern of energies and directions of the scattered electrons, physicists can infer the size of the proton. And the answer they obtain, though again not as precise as obtained from <em>muonic</em> hydrogen, is about as precise and gives about the same answer as that obtained from transitions between states of <em>ordinary</em> hydrogen: 0.88 fermi.  This is illustrated in Figure 6, taken from <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1301.0905" target="_blank">the same recent review article.</a></p>

The energy of the electrons is chosen low enough that the proton is not itself greatly distorted or shattered. By studying the probability of and the pattern of scattering, scientists can determine the size of the proton.</p></div></p>
<p>This is not a dramatic difference &#8212; it represents only a 4% discrepancy. But the previous measurements of the proton radius were believed to be precise to about 0.9% (for a single standard deviation.) So the new measurements differ from the average of the old ones by a relatively large amount, which the authors state is about 7 standard deviations<em> [though how this number was obtained is obscure to me currently.  Presumably it is explained clearly in <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/339/6118/417" target="_blank">the published paper</a>, which is in Science Magazine.  I will try to clarify this point later today if I can.]</em></p>
<p>Well, 7 standard deviations (or &#8220;sigmas&#8221;) is far more than the 3 to 5 standard deviations that are typically considered impressive. However, one should remember that statistically significant results simply imply discovery of either (a) something about nature or (b) a human error&#8230; with the latter always more likely. The famous <a title="This Time, ICARUS Really DOES Refute OPERA" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/16/this-time-icarus-really-does-refute-opera/" target="_blank">faster-than-light neutrinos disagreed with Einstein&#8217;s prediction by 6 standard deviations</a>, and all that meant was that someone made a mistake.</p>

A variety of measurements (and reanalyses thereof) of the proton radius, by year.  Most of them were made in hydrogen state transitions and in electron-proton scattering experiments.  Almost all recent non-muonic measurements are somewhat above the muonic hydrogen measurement, which lies near the words &#8220;muonic hydrogen&#8221; and is much more precise than all previous measurements.  The most recent muonic hydrogen measurement is not shown, but is consistent with and even more precise than the one shown.</p></div></p>
<p>Now the most exciting and revolutionary explanation (but, in my current view, very unlikely) for this disagreement would be a new force or other new phenomenon that affects muons and not electrons (or affects exotic small atoms more strongly than ones of ordinary size.) Its presence would foul up the proton size measurement by changing muonic hydrogen slightly, in a way that is not accounted for in the theory calculation that is needed for extracting the proton&#8217;s size.</p>
<p><span style="color:#993366;">[Note Added: It is extremely unlikely indeed that there could be an unknown force powerful enough to <strong>actually</strong> change the proton&#8217;s size!  Such a force would have to counter the strong nuclear force that sets the size of the proton, and anything so large would have been observed decades ago, in other experiments.  No; instead, what is most plausible is a wimpy force whose small effects subtly change the relationship between the <em>measurement</em> and the <em>calculation that is done to <strong>infer</strong> the proton&#8217;s size</em> from that measurement.  Then the proton has only one size, but the size wasn&#8217;t properly extracted from one of the measurements because a small effect was left out.]<br />
</span></p>
<p>But a number of my colleagues have shown, in various ways, that to introduce a new force that would affect muonic hydrogen by this amount, and not muck up previous measurements of the properties of muons or electrons or protons or neutrons, and not show up in the decays of other well-studied particles, is extremely difficult; it requires arranging multiple cancellations between multiple effects, at a level that is highly unpalatable. Maybe I&#8217;ll write about this at a later time, but I warn you that you won&#8217;t like what you see.  You can find relevant references in section 4.5 of the Pohl et al. review.</p>
<p>On top of this difficulty, the discrepancy is not (in my personal view) as crisp as it looks at first glance. The calculations required to extract the proton&#8217;s size are very complicated indeed, and have many ingredients and steps; the measurements are not very sensitive to the proton&#8217;s size, so highly precise measurements and a heck of a lot of theoretical processing are both needed before one can extract the desired information. (In the Pohl et al. review, the authors, merely to summarize the various calculations that are needed and have been performed, require well over a dozen densely written and highly technical pages.) At certain stages along the way, experts might perhaps have been a bit 0verly optimistic about how well their methods work, and if so, perhaps the resulting theoretical uncertainty in one of the proton&#8217;s size measurements is underestimated. Given the complexities and subtleties, which lie outside my expertise, the best I can do is warn you that the Pohl et al. review does point out some potential concerns. Here&#8217;s a quotation: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">To summarize, the apparently simple problem of determining the slope of the form factor at Q<sup>2</sup> = 0 <em>[which is needed to extract the proton radius from electron-proton scattering]</em> has numerous potential pitfalls. The weight of the evidence at this point continues to favor a larger radius, about 0.88 fm, but suggests that claiming an uncertainty at the 0.01 fm level is optimistic</span>.&#8221; This is not the only issue where questions are raised, though without firm conclusions.  It does mean one should remain cautious.  A discrepancy of 7 standard deviations sounds like a lot; but if you underestimated an important source of systematic uncertainties by a factor of 2 or 3, your 7 standard deviations could drop to an unimpressive 3.5 or 2 in a big hurry. So a very careful reconsideration of the uncertainties is necessary.</p>
<p>Fortunately many additional related measurements (discussed in section 5 of the Pohl et al. review) are being planned, and collectively these should help clarify and perhaps resolve this puzzle. Meanwhile the relevant theorists are clearly working hard to check previous calculations and assure that the limitations on their methods are properly accounted for.</p>
<p>At this point I am not optimistic that this discrepancy has a profound origin. But hey &#8212; you never really know for certain until the situation is satisfactorily settled &#8212; so we&#8217;ll need to keep a close eye on this puzzle as it evolves.  There&#8217;s a very low but non-zero probability that it is of great importance. And if it is, I personally doubt anyone has yet thought of the reason.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The meaning of the title of Clara Moskowitz&#8217;s new article for the public, &#8220;<a href="http://www.space.com/18615-dark-matter-mystery-search.html" target="_blank">Dark Matter Mystery May Soon Be Solved</a>&#8220;, all lies in the word &#8220;may&#8221;.  It may.  It may not.</p>
<p>According to the article, &#8220;the answer to this cosmic mystery could come within the next three or four years, scientists say.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have to admit that this kind of phraseology, which one often sees in the press in reports about science, drives me a bit nuts.  <em>Which</em> scientists? How <em>many</em> of them?  You can&#8217;t tell from this line whether this is something that a group of three or four mavericks are claiming, or whether it is conventional wisdom shared by most of the community.   And &#8220;the answer&#8230; could come&#8230;&#8221;? Interpreted literally it is content-free: yes, the answer could come in the next few years, or not &#8212; but you don&#8217;t need any scientists to tell you that.  If one interprets it more optimistically &#8212; that it is intended to imply that the answer will <em><strong>very likely</strong> </em>come within the next three or four years &#8212; then I think it is far from clear what fraction of the experts will agree with that statement.</p>
<p>Rather than debate the claim, let&#8217;s start with the physics.  What will determine how long it takes to discover what dark matter is made from?<span id="more-5049"></span></p>
<p>Well, it is possible this has already started to happen; <a title="Dark Matter: Now You See It, Now You Don’t" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/04/20/dark-matter-now-you-see-it-now-you-dont/" target="_blank">remember this hint of a discovery of dark matter</a>?  This is still alive; here&#8217;s <a href="http://resonaances.blogspot.com/2012/11/fermi-on-fermi-line.html" target="_blank">a recent update from the Resonaances blog</a>.  Whether this is a real signal of dark matter or an experimental problem or subtlety, only time will tell. But such a discovery could occur, in the optimistic scenario that dark matter particles are abundant and that, when they find each other near the center of the galaxy, they often annihilate in spectacular fashion, to a pair of photons.  It would almost be &#8212; and it may be &#8212; too good to be true.</p>
<p>Alternatively, an extremely pessimistic scenario is possible: that dark matter is made from something that only interacts with ordinary matter via gravitational forces, which are exceedingly weak.  In this case there is <strong>no</strong> possibility that any of the on-going searches for dark matter particles will turn up anything, because all of them assume, by necessity, that the particles they are looking for <strong>do</strong> interact with ordinary matter in some much stronger, non-gravitational fashion.</p>
<p>And even if dark matter is made from particles that do interact with ordinary matter in a non-gravitational way, how long it takes to find them will depend on how rare they are, and on how strong those non-gravitational forces are.  We know roughly how much dark matter there is out in the universe, but (assuming it is even made from particles, which we don&#8217;t know for sure) it might be made from a great abundance of low-mass particles or a lesser abundance of particles with a large mass.  All other things being equal, it&#8217;s harder to find the particles if there are fewer of them around.  And we can infer how these particles will interact with ordinary matter only by making certain simplifying assumptions about how the dark matter particles were left behind as the universe cooled during the Big Bang.  These assumptions are just that: assumptions, ones which are intelligent but not necessarily correct.</p>
<p>So we can&#8217;t guess whether insights into the nature of dark matter have already been obtained, whether they won&#8217;t be obtained for centuries, or whether the next few years will dramatically change our knowledge.</p>
<p>What <em>is</em> true &#8212; and this is really the content, properly interpreted, of the article I referenced at the beginning &#8212; is that the next few years will allow for some of the most <em>popular</em> possibilities for the nature of dark matter to be ruled out or confirmed.  (If you read the last half of the article, you&#8217;ll find this is actually its meaning, despite the optimistic words in the first half of the article.) Of course, just because something is popular doesn&#8217;t mean it is more likely.  And that means that when you&#8217;ve ruled out the popular options, you can&#8217;t assume the unpopular options are wrong; you still have to go check. <em> [You&#8217;ve heard me say this, <a title="Why Theories Don’t Go Into Hospitals" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/11/14/why-theories-dont-go-into-hospitals/" target="_blank">even recently</a>, about supersymmetry, extra dimensions, and the like; that&#8217;s because it&#8217;s always true when you&#8217;re searching.  Notice what Lance Dixon says in the article accords with this point of view.]</em>  So although one can be hopeful, the stark reality is that this process could take a few years, decades, or millenia.</p>
<p>As Dan Bauer says at the end of the article, &#8220;I guess it’s the natural optimism of physicists to think [dark matter] is something we might actually be able to find.&#8221;  I have nothing against optimism, as long as we don&#8217;t confuse our own optimism that nature behaves in such and such a way for high likelihood that nature behaves that way. Optimism is a good thing: most of the things we look for &#8212; decay of the <a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/" target="_blank">proton</a>, neutrino oscillations, dark matter, etc. &#8212; don&#8217;t come with a guarantee that they are discoverable. <em> [The <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">Higgs particle</a> was very unusual; we had a very strong reason to believe it or something like it had to be discoverable at the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a>, because without it our equations for the already-known particles were inconsistent.  We are rarely so confident.]</em>  Pessimism would keep us from doing these experiments; and although most such experiments do come up empty (proton decay, for instance &#8212; at least so far), a few exceptional ones do not (<a title="Neutrino Types and Neutrino Oscillations" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/neutrino-types-and-neutrino-oscillations/">neutrino oscillations</a>) and they permanently change our understanding of the world.  Maybe dark matter will be discovered soon, maybe it won&#8217;t; but it is a good thing that we&#8217;re looking for it.   And maybe a better title for Ms. Moskowitz&#8217;s article would have been &#8220;Searchers for Dark Matter Optimistic About Near Term.&#8221;  That at least would have been undeniable.</p>
