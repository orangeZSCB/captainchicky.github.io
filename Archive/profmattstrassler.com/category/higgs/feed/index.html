										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At CERN, the laboratory that hosts the Large Hadron Collider [LHC]. Four years ago, almost to the day. Fabiola Gianotti, spokesperson for the ATLAS experiment, delivered the first talk in a presentation on 2011 LHC data. Speaking to the assembled scientists and dignitaries, she presented the message that energized the physics community: a little bump had shown up on a plot. <span id="more-8086"></span>On the plot were the numbers of proton-proton collisions that had produced two energetic photons <em>(particles of light)</em>, shown versus the &#8220;invariant mass&#8221; of the two photons <em>(the mass that a parent particle would have had, <strong>if</strong> the two photons had come from a parent particle &#8212; although the vast majority of them do not.) </em>Most two-photon production processes are pretty random, and produce data that forms a smooth curve on such a plot. But a new particle decaying to two photons would, if it existed, be observed as a little upward wiggle on that curve. And that&#8217;s what ATLAS&#8217;s data showed.</p>

<p>But those were early days. Statistical flukes happen more often than most people realize, and the bump wasn&#8217;t large enough to be convincing. Still, supporting the case, CMS (represented by Guido Tonelli) showed some hints too around the same mass, not just in two photon events but in some other plots. In retrospect, some of the CMS and ATLAS hints were real, though there was no way to be certain for the next six months.</p>
<p>Then on July 4th, 2012, Joe Incandela of CMS, followed by Gianotti, delivered the coup de grace. The data they showed confirmed a new type of particle, with behavior somewhat resembling a Higgs particle.</p>

<p>Within a few more months, it had become clear that the new particle was indeed a Higgs particle, resembling the one predicted in the Standard Model. <em>(The Standard Model is the set of equations used to predict the behavior of the known particles, with the inclusion of the simplest possible type of Higgs particle. We are calling the new Higgs particle &#8220;Standard Model-<strong>like</strong>&#8221; because we have a lot of work left to do before we can be confident that it <strong>really</strong> is the one that is present in the Standard Model.)</em></p>
<p>Fast forward to today. Gianotti, as of January 1, will become Director General of CERN. It is time now for a new generation of leading scientists to give the presentations on LHC&#8217;s 2015 data. 2011 was the start of a thrilling, exciting, maddening time as we waited through half of 2012 before the existence of the new particle became certain. Will we be so lucky today?  Rumors have been rife. Stay tuned.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the long and careful process of restarting the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC] after its two-year nap for upgrades and repairs, another milestone has been reached: <a href="http://home.web.cern.ch/about/updates/2015/05/low-energy-collisions-tune-lhc-experiments">protons have once again collided inside the LHC&#8217;s experimental detectors</a> (named ATLAS, CMS, LHCb and ALICE). This is good news, but don&#8217;t get excited yet. It&#8217;s just one small step. These are collisions at the lowest energy at which the LHC operates (450 GeV per proton, to be compared with the 4000 GeV per proton in 2012 and the 6500 GeV per proton they&#8217;ve already achieved in the last month, though in non-colliding beams.) Also the number of protons in the beams, and the number of collisions per second, is still very, very small compared to what will be needed. So discoveries are not imminent!  Yesterday&#8217;s milestone was just one of the many little tests that are made to assure that the LHC is properly set up and ready for the first full-energy collisions, which should start in about a month.</p>
<p>But since full-energy collisions are on the horizon, why not listen to a radio show about what the LHC will be doing after its restart is complete? Today (Wednesday May 6th), <a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/virtually-speaking-science">Virtually Speaking Science</a>, on which I have appeared a couple of times before, will run a program at 5 pm Pacific time (8 pm Eastern). Science writer Alan Boyle will be interviewing me about the LHC&#8217;s plans for the next few months and the coming years. You can listen live, or listen later once they post it.  <a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/virtually-speaking-science/2015/05/07/alan-boyle-matt-strassler-large-hadron-collider">Here&#8217;s the link for the program.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hope all of you had a good holiday and a good start to the New Year!</p>
<p>I myself continue to be extraordinarily busy as we move into 2015, but I am glad to say that some of that activity involves communicating science to the public.  In fact, <strong>a week from today</strong> I will be giving a public talk &#8212; really a short talk and a longer question/answer period &#8212; in Cambridge, just outside of Boston and not far from MIT. This event is a part of the monthly &#8220;CafeSci&#8221; series, which is affiliated with the famous <a href="http://www.wgbh.org/programs/NOVA-16?MM=1">NOVA science television programs</a> produced for decades by <a href="http://www.wgbh.org/">public TV/Radio station WGBH</a> in Boston.</p>
<p>Note for those of you have gone before to CafeSci events: <strong>it will be in a new venue, not far from Kendall Square</strong>. Here&#8217;s the announcement:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Tuesday, January 20th at 7pm (about 1 hour long)<br />
Le Laboratoire Cambridge (NEW LOCATION)<br />
<a href="http://www.lelaboratoirecambridge.com">http://www.lelaboratoirecambridge.com/ </a><br />
650 East Kendall St, Cambridge, MA</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>“The Large Hadron Collider Restarts Soon! What Lies Ahead?&#8221;</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Speaker: Matthew Strassler</p>
<p><span style="color:#800080;"><em>&#8220;After a long nap, the Large Hadron Collider [LHC], where the Higgs particle was discovered in 2012, will begin operating again in 2015, with more powerful collisions than before. Now that we know Higgs particles exist, what do we want to know about them? What methods can we use to answer our questions? And what is the most important puzzle that we are hoping the LHC will help us solve?&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p>Public Transit: Red line to Kendall Square, walk straight down 3rd Street, turn right onto Athenaeum Street, and left onto East Kendall</p>
<p>Parking: There is a parking deck &#8211; the 650 East Kendall Street Garage &#8211; accessible by Linskey Way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="The Trigger: Discarding All But the Gold" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/the-trigger-discarding-all-but-the-gold/">Triggering is an essential part of the Large Hadron Collider [LHC]</a>; there are so many collisions happening each second at the LHC, compared to the number that the experiments can afford to store for later study, that the data about most of the collisions (99.999%) have to be thrown away immediately, completely and permanently within a second after the collisions occur.  The automated filter, partly hardware and partly software, that is programmed to make the decision as to what to keep and what to discard is called &#8220;the trigger&#8221;.  This all sounds crazy, but it&#8217;s necessary, and it works.   Usually.</p>
<p>Let me give you one very simple example of how things can go wrong, and how the ATLAS and CMS experiments [the two general purpose experiments at the LHC] attempted to address the problem.  Before you read this, you may want to read <a title="Final Days of Busy Visit to CERN" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/12/02/final-days-of-busy-visit-to-cern/"><span style="color:#000000;">my last post</span></a>, which gives an overview of what I&#8217;ll be talking about in this one.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m a few days behind (thanks to an NSF grant proposal that had to be finished last week) but I wanted to write a bit more about <a title="Day 2 At CERN" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/11/12/day-2-at-cern/">my visit to CERN</a>, which concluded Nov. 21st in a whirlwind of activity. I was working full tilt on timely issues related to Run 2 of the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC], currently scheduled to start early next May.   (You may recall the LHC has been shut down for repairs and upgrades since the end of 2012.)</p>
<p>A certain fraction of my time for the last decade has been taken up by concerns about the LHC experiments&#8217; ability to observe new long-lived particles, specifically ones that aren&#8217;t affected by <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/">the electromagnetic or strong nuclear forces</a>. (Long-lived particles that <em>are</em> affected by those forces are easier to search for, and are much more constrained by the LHC experiments.  More about them some other time.)</p>
<p>This subject is important to me because it is a classic example of how <a title="The Trigger: Discarding All But the Gold" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/the-trigger-discarding-all-but-the-gold/">the trigger systems</a> at LHC experiments could fail us &#8212; whereby a spectacular signal of a new phenomena could be discarded and lost in the very process of taking and storing the data! If no one thinks carefully about the challenges of finding long-lived particles in advance of running the LHC, we can end up losing a huge opportunity, unnecessarily. Fortunately some of us are thinking about it, but we are small in number. It is an uphill battle for those experimenters within ATLAS and CMS [the two general purpose experiments at the LHC] who are working hard to make sure they have the required triggers available. I can&#8217;t tell you how many times people within the experiments &#8212; even at <a title="At the Naturalness 2014 Conference" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/11/17/at-the-naturalness-2014-conference/">the Naturalness conference</a> I wrote about recently &#8212; have told me &#8220;such efforts are hopeless&#8221;&#8230; despite the fact that their own experiments have actually shown, already in public and in some cases published measurements (including <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1203.1303">this</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1411.6977">this</a>, <a href="http://cds.cern.ch/record/1740972/files/ATLAS-CONF-2014-041.pdf">this</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1411.6530">this</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1409.0746">this</a>, and <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1409.4789">this</a>), that it is not. Conversely, many completely practical searches for long-lived particles have not been carried out, often because there was no trigger strategy able to capture them, or because, despite the events having been recorded, no one at ATLAS or CMS has had time or energy to actually search through their data for this signal.</p>
<p>Now what is meant by &#8220;long-lived particles&#8221;?<span id="more-7789"></span></p>
<p><a title="Most Particles Decay — But Why?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/why-do-particles-decay/most-particles-decay-why/">Most types of particles decay</a> (i.e., disintegrate into lower-mass particles). Any particular <em>type</em> of particle has an <em>average</em> lifetime, though an <strong>individual</strong> one may live a <strong>longer or shorter</strong> life than the average.  A <a title="The Nuclei of Atoms: At the Heart of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-nuclei-of-atoms-at-the-heart-of-matter/">neutron</a>, if found outside a stable <a title="The Nuclei of Atoms: At the Heart of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-nuclei-of-atoms-at-the-heart-of-matter/">atomic nucleus</a>, decays into a proton, and electron and an anti-neutrino after about 15 minutes&#8230; sometimes shorter, sometimes longer, but 15 minutes on average.</p>
<p>In the context of the LHC, the term &#8220;long-lived particle&#8221; doesn&#8217;t mean a particle will outlast you and me! or even a neutron.  It merely that its average lifetime is long enough that, if traveling at a good fraction of the speed of light, it is likely to move a measurable distance before it decays&#8230; i.e. that it lives a <em>trillionth of a second</em> or longer. The ATLAS and CMS experiments, despite being the size of small office buildings, are able to detect when a particle&#8217;s decay occurs a millimeter (about 1/25 of an inch) away, or even less, from the location of the proton-proton collision where it was created. <em>(Pretty amazing, huh? My experimental colleagues are awesome.)</em> This astounding ability is critical in identifying bottom and charm quarks, which often decay at a location separated from the collision point by as little as a millimeter.</p>
<p>In contrast to a neutron, the <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/">Higgs particle</a> which was <a title="Discovery of the Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-discovery-of-the-higgs/">discovered at ATLAS and CMS</a> in 2012 is very short-lived; a typical Higgs particle, from its birth to its death at the LHC, <strong><em>won&#8217;t even travel an atom&#8217;s width</em></strong> from the location at which it was created, living about a billionth of a trillionth of a second. But there are other known particles that are much longer lived, such as the muon. A muon, once produced, will survive for two millionths of a second on average &#8212; during which, if it is traveling at a good fraction of the speed of light*, it can travel a good fraction of a mile.</p>
<p>*<span style="color:#808080;"><em>Due to time dilation, a consequence of relativity à la Einstein, if the muon is traveling very close to the speed of light relative to us, it will actually, from our point of view, live longer and travel further than average. This is why very high energy muons created in cosmic ray collisions high in the atmosphere often are able to travel hundreds of miles, often <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttjkd_E7-58">reaching the Earth&#8217;s surface</a>.</em></span></p>
<p>But the really important question for the LHC is whether it might be able to produce <em>as-yet unknown</em> particles that have long lifetimes. We haven&#8217;t found a long-lived particle for a while &#8212; the bottom quark was the most recently discovered long-lived elementary particle, and that was about 40 years ago &#8212; but we found many before, and why shouldn&#8217;t there be others? Indeed such particles are predicted, with small to moderate certainty, in various speculations that have been considered by theorists over the years, including some creative ideas about the nature of dark matter, certain forms of <a title="Supersymmetry — What Is It?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/supersymmetry-what-is-it/">supersymmetry</a>, various attempts to understand the masses of <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/">the known particles</a>, etc. What got me interested in the problem, back in 2001 or so, is that I noticed that if one takes a broad view, and considers a wider set of variants of these speculative ideas, one quickly sees that <em>long-lived particles are far more common than they are in the most popular variants of these ideas</em>. (After some intermittent research, this observation was finally published in <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0604261">2006 work with Kathryn Zurek</a>.)</p>
<p>In other words, <em>due to cultural biases among scientists, but not due to anything about nature itself, the possibility of long-lived particles was viewed as far more remote than it really is</em>. (Though the biases have improved since 2006, to a certain extent they still remain.) And for this reason, the LHC experiments, as of 2006, had prepared for only a fraction of the possibilities, and were even lacking trigger strategies that could be sensitive to certain types of long-lived particles. The worry was especially acute if the long-lived particles were created mainly in the decays of a lightweight Higgs particle. A Higgs particle of mass 125 GeV/c², such as the one we have in nature, has such low mass-energy (125 GeV) compared to the energy of LHC proton-on-proton collisions (7000 GeV in 2011, 8000 GeV in 2012, and 13,000 GeV starting in 2015) that its decays are generally unspectacular and are difficult to observe; the 2012 discovery of the Higgs required careful trigger design, and this will become even more important for Higgs studies in Run 2. So I have spent a lot of time since 2007 trying to help change the situation, so that we can be sure that, if such particles exist, we will discover them, and if we don&#8217;t find them, we&#8217;ll be confident we did a thorough search and didn&#8217;t just miss one for lack of trying.  To this end, I spent much of my time at CERN giving talks and having extended conversations, both planned and spontaneous, with experimental colleagues at ATLAS and CMS, and discussing the issues with theorist colleagues as well.</p>
<p>I realize this is a bit abstract, so in a day or two I&#8217;ll give you a more detailed example of how a new trigger strategy can be crucial in allowing for the possibility of a discovery of long-lived particles.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Day 2 of my visit to CERN (host laboratory of the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC]) was a pretty typical CERN day for me. Here&#8217;s a rough sketch of how it panned out:</p>
<ul>
<li>1000: after a few chores, arrived at CERN by tram. Worked on my ongoing research project #1. Answered an email about my ongoing research project #2.</li>
<li>1100: attended a one hour talk, much of it historical, by Chris Quigg, one of the famous experts on &#8220;quarkonium&#8221; (atom-like objects made from a quark or anti-quark, generally referring specifically to charm and bottom quarks). Charmonium (charm quark/antiquark atoms) was discovered 40 years ago this week, in two very different experiments.</li>
<li>1200: Started work on the talk that I am giving on the afternoon of Day 3 to some experimentalists who work at ATLAS. <em>[ATLAS and CMS are the two general-purpose experimental detectors at the LHC; they were used to <a title="Discovery of the Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-discovery-of-the-higgs/" target="_blank">discover the Higgs particle</a>.]</em> It involves some new insights concerning the search for long-lived particles <em>(hypothesized types of new particles that would typically <a title="Most Particles Decay — But Why?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/why-do-particles-decay/most-particles-decay-why/" target="_blank">decay</a> only after having traveled a distance of at least a millimeter, and possibly a meter or more, before they decay to other particles.)</em></li>
<li>1230: Working lunch with an experimentalist from ATLAS and another theorist, mainly discussing <a title="The Trigger: Discarding All But the Gold" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/the-trigger-discarding-all-but-the-gold/" target="_blank">triggering</a>, and other related issues, concerning long-lived particles. Learned a lot about the new opportunities that ATLAS will have starting in 2015.</li>
<li>1400: In an extended discussion with two other theorists, got a partial answer to a subtle question that arose in my research project #2.</li>
<li>1415: Sent an email to my collaborators on research project #2.</li>
<li>1430: Back to work on my talk for Day 3. Reading some relevant papers, drawing some illustrations, etc.</li>
<li>1600: Two-hour conversation over coffee with an experimentalist from CMS, yet again about triggering, regarding long-lived particles, exotic decays of the Higgs particle, and both at once. Learned a lot of important things about CMS&#8217;s plans for the near-term and medium-term future, as well as some of the subtle issues with collecting and analyzing data that are likely to arise in 2015, when the LHC begins running again.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>[Why triggering, triggering, triggering? Because if you don&#8217;t collect the data in the first place, you can&#8217;t analyze it later!  We have to be working on triggering in 2014-2015 before the LHC takes data again in 2015-2018]</em></p>
<ul>
<li>1800: An hour to work on the talk again.</li>
<li>1915: Skype conversation with two of my collaborators in research project #1, about a difficult challenge which had been troubling me for over a week. Subtle theoretical issues and heavy duty discussion, but worth it in the end; most of the issues look like they may be resolvable.</li>
<li>2100: Noticed the time and that I hadn&#8217;t eaten dinner yet. Went to the CERN cafeteria and ate dinner while answering emails.</li>
<li>2130: More work on the talk for Day 3.</li>
<li>2230: Left CERN. Wrote blog post on the tram to the hotel.</li>
<li>2300: Went back to work in my hotel room.</li>
</ul>
<p>Day 1 was similarly busy and informative, but had the added feature that I hadn&#8217;t slept since the previous day. (I never seem to sleep on overnight flights.) Day 3 is likely to be as busy as Day 2. I&#8217;ll be leaving Geneva before dawn on Day 4, heading to a conference.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a hectic schedule, but I&#8217;m learning many things!  And if I can help make these huge and crucial experiments more powerful, and give my colleagues a greater chance of a discovery and a reduced chance of missing one, it will all be worth it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a couple of months of hard work on grant writing, career plans and scientific research, I&#8217;ve made it back to my blogging keyboard.  I&#8217;m on my way to Switzerland for a couple of weeks in Europe, spending much of the time at the <a href="http://home.web.cern.ch/" target="_blank">CERN laboratory</a>. CERN, of course, is the host of the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC], where the <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">Higgs particle</a> was discovered in 2012. I&#8217;ll be consulting with my experimentalist and theorist colleagues there&#8230; I have many questions for them. And I hope they&#8217;ll have many questions for me too, both ones I can answer and others that will force me to go off and think for a while.</p>
<p>You may recall that the LHC was turned off (as planned) in early 2013 for repairs and an upgrade. Run 2 of the LHC will start next year, with <a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/" target="_blank">protons</a> colliding at an energy of around 13 <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/" target="_blank">TeV</a> per collision. This is larger than in Run 1, which saw 7 TeV per collision in 2011 and 8 TeV in 2012.  This increases the probability that a proton-proton collision will make a Higgs particle, which has a mass of 125 GeV/c², by about a factor of 2 ½.  <em>(Don&#8217;t try to figure that out in your head; the calculation requires detailed knowledge of <a title="Checking What’s Inside a Proton" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/checking-whats-inside-a-proton/">what&#8217;s inside a proton</a>.)</em> The number of proton-proton collisions per second will also be larger in Run 2 than in Run 1, though not immediately. In fact I would not be surprised if 2015 is mostly spent addressing unexpected challenges. But Run 1 was a classic: a small pilot run in 2010 led to rapid advances in 2011 and performance beyond expectations in 2012. It&#8217;s quite common for these machines to underperform at first, because of unforeseen issues, and outperform in the long run, as those issues are solved and human ingenuity has time to play a role. All of which is merely to say that I would view any really useful results in 2015 as a bonus; my focus is on 2016-2018.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it a bit early to be thinking about 2016? No, now is the time to be thinking about 2016 <a title="The Trigger: Discarding All But the Gold" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/the-trigger-discarding-all-but-the-gold/">triggering challenges</a> for certain types of difficult-to-observe phenomena. These include <a title="Non-Standard Decays of the Observed Higgs Particle" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/non-standard-decays-of-the-observed-higgs-particle/" target="_blank">exotic, unexpected decays of the Higgs particle</a>, or other hard-to-observe types of Higgs particles that might exist and be lurking in the LHC&#8217;s data, or rare decays of the <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">W and Z particle</a>, and more generally, anything that involves a particle whose (rest) mass is in the 100 <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/" target="_blank">GeV</a>/c² range, and whose mass-energy is therefore less than a percent of the overall proton-proton collision energy. The higher the collision energy grows, the harder it becomes to study relatively low-energy processes, even though we make more of them. To be able to examine them thoroughly and potentially discover something out of place &#8212; something that could reveal a secret worth even more than the Higgs particle itself &#8212; we have to become more and more clever, open-minded and vigilant.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No.</p>
<p>The Higgs boson is not dangerous and will not destroy the universe.</p>
<p>The Higgs boson is a type of <em>particle</em>, a little ripple in the Higgs <em>field</em>. <em>[See <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">here for the Higgs FAQ</a>.]</em> This lowly particle, if you&#8217;re lucky enough to make one (and at the world&#8217;s largest particle accelerator, the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a>, only one in a trillion proton-proton collisions actually does so) has a brief life, <a title="Most Particles Decay — But Why?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/why-do-particles-decay/most-particles-decay-why/" target="_blank">disintegrating to other particles</a> in less than the time that it takes light to cross from one side of an atom to another. (Recall that light can travel from the Earth to the Moon in under two seconds.) Such a fragile creature is hardly more dangerous than a <a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/189544/mayfly" target="_blank">mayfly</a>.</p>
<p>Anyone who says otherwise probably read Hawking&#8217;s book (or read about it in the press) but didn&#8217;t understand what he or she was reading, perhaps because he or she had not read <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">the Higgs FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to worry about something Higgs-related, you can <em>try</em> to worry about the Higgs field, which is &#8220;ON&#8221; in our universe, though not nearly as &#8220;on&#8221; as it could be. If someone were to turn the Higgs field OFF, let&#8217;s say as a practical joke, that would be a disaster: all ordinary matter across the universe would explode, because the <a title="Electrons: On the Outskirts of Atoms" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/electrons-on-the-outskirts-of-atoms/" target="_blank">electrons on the outskirts of atoms</a> would <a title="Why the Higgs Particle Matters" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/why-the-higgs-particle-matters/" target="_blank">lose their mass and fly off into space</a>. This is not something to worry about, however. We know it would require an input of energy and can&#8217;t happen spontaneously.  Moreover, the amount of energy required to artificially turn the Higgs field off is immense; to do so even in a small room would require energy comparable to that of a typical supernova, an explosion of a star that can outshine an entire galaxy and releases the vast majority of its energy in unseen neutrinos. No one, fortunately, has a supernova in his or her back pocket. And if someone did, we&#8217;d have more immediate problems than worrying about someone wasting a supernova trying to turn off the Higgs field in a basement somewhere.</p>
<p>Now it would also be a disaster if someone could turn the Higgs field WAY UP&#8230; more than when your older brother turned up the volume on your stereo or MP3 player and blew out your speakers. In this case atoms would violently collapse, or worse, and things would be just as nasty as if the Higgs field were turned OFF. Should you worry about this? Well, it&#8217;s possible this could happen spontaneously, so it&#8217;s slightly more plausible. But I do mean slightly. <strong><em>Very</em></strong> slightly.<span id="more-7739"></span></p>
<p>Recently, physicists have been writing about this possibility because if (a) you <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>ASSUME</strong></span> that the types of particles that we&#8217;ve discovered so far are the <em>only</em> ones that affect the Higgs field, and (b) you <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">ASSUME</span></strong> that there are no other important forces that affect the Higgs field other than the ones we know, then you can calculate, with <em>some</em> degree of reliability (though there is a debate about that degree) that (1) the Higgs field could lower the energy of the universe by suddenly jumping from ON to WAY WAY SUPER-DUPER ON, and (2) that the time we&#8217;d have to wait for it to do so spontaneously isn&#8217;t infinite.  It would do this in two steps: first a bubble of WAY WAY ON Higgs field would form <em>(via the curious ability of quantum mechanics to make the improbable happen, rarely)</em>, and then that bubble would expand and sweep across the universe, destroying everything in its path.</p>
<p><em>An aside: In particle physics <a title="Modern Physics: Increasingly Vacuous" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/05/08/modern-physics-increasingly-vacuous/">lingo explained here</a>, we say that &#8220;the universe has two possible &#8216;vacua&#8217;, the vacuum we live in, in which the Higgs field is ON a bit, and a second vacuum in which the Higgs field is HUGELY ON.&#8221; If the second vacuum has lower energy than the first, then the first vacuum is said to be &#8220;metastable&#8221;: although it lasts a very long time, it has a very small but non-zero probability of turning into the second vacuum someday.  That&#8217;s because a bubble of the second vacuum that appears by chance inside the first vacuum will expand, and take over the whole universe.</em></p>
<p>Ok. First, should you buy the original assumptions? No. It&#8217;s just humans assuming that what we currently know is all there is to know; since when has that been true?  Second, even if you do buy them, should you worry about the conclusion? No. The universe has existed in its current form for about 13.7 billion years. The Higgs field may not perform this nasty jump for trillions of years, or trillions of trillions, or trillions of trillions of trillions, or more. Likely more. In any case, nobody knows, but really, nobody should care very much. The calculation is hard, the answer highly uncertain, and worse, the whole thing is profoundly dependent on the <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">ASSUMPTIONS</span></strong>. In fact, if the assumptions are slightly wrong &#8212; if there are other particles and forces that affect the Higgs field, or if there is more than one Higgs-like field in nature &#8212; then the calculation could end up being way off from the truth. Also possible is that the calculational method, which is subtle, isn&#8217;t yet refined enough to give the right answer.  Altogether, this means that not only might the Higgs field&#8217;s nasty jump be much more or less likely than is currently believed, it might not even be possible at all. So we don&#8217;t actually <em>know</em> anything for sure, despite all the loose talk that suggests that we do.  But in any case, since the universe has lived 13.7 billion years already, the chance is <strong><em>ridiculously tiny</em></strong> that this Higgs field jump, even if it is possible at all, will occur in your ultra-short 100 year-ish lifetime, or even that of any of your descendants.</p>
<p>What about the possibility that human beings could <em>artificially</em> cause the Higgs field to turn WAY WAY ON? Again, the amount of energy involved in trying to do that is extremely large &#8212; not a supernova, now, but far, far beyond current human capability, and likely impossible.  (The technology required to build a particle accelerator with collisions at this energy, and the financial and environmental cost of running it, are more than a little difficult to imagine.)  At this point we can barely make Higgs bosons &#8212; little ripples in the Higgs field; now you want to imagine us making a bubble where the Higgs field is WAY WAY WAY MORE ON than usual? We&#8217;re scientists, not magicians. And we deal in science &#8212; i.e., reality.  Current and foreseeable technology cannot turn this imaginary possibility into reality.</p>
<p>Some dangers actually exist in reality. Asteroidlets do sometimes hit the earth; supernovas do explode, and a nearby one would be terrible; and you should not be wandering outdoors or in a shower during a lightning storm.  As for the possible spontaneous destruction of the universe? Well, if it happens some day, it may have nothing to do with the Higgs field; it may very well be due to <em>some other</em> field, about which we currently know <em>nothing</em>, making a jump of a sort that we haven&#8217;t even learned about yet. Humans tend to assume that the things they know about are much scarier than they actually are (e.g. Yellowstone, the &#8220;super&#8221;-volcano) and that the things they don&#8217;t know about are much less scary than they actually are (e.g. what people used to think about ozone-destroying chemicals before they knew they destroyed ozone.) This is worth keeping in mind.</p>
<p>So anyone who tells you that we <em>know</em> that the universe is only &#8220;meta-stable&#8221;, and that someday the Higgs field will destroy it by suddenly screaming at the top of its lungs, or that we might cause it to do so, is forgetting to tell you about all the assumptions that went into that conclusion, and about the incredible energies required which may far exceed what humans can ever manage, and about the incredible lengths of time that may be involved, by which point there may be no more stars left to keep life going anyway, and possibly not even any more protons to make atoms out of. There&#8217;s a word for this kind of wild talk: &#8220;scare-mongering&#8221;.  You can safely go back to sleep.</p>
<p>Or not. There&#8217;s plenty to keep you awake. But by comparison with the spread of the Ebola virus, the increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and acidification of the oceans, or the accelerating loss of the world&#8217;s biodiversity, not to mention the greed and violence common in our species, worrying about Higgs bosons, or even the Higgs field in which a Higgs particle is a tiny ripple, seems to me a tempest in a top quark.</p>
