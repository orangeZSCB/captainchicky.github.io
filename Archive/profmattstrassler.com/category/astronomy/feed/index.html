										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>[Note Added: Thanks to some great comments I&#8217;ve received, I&#8217;m continuing to add clarifying remarks to this post.  You&#8217;ll find them in <span style="color:#008000;">green</span>.]</strong></em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a couple of months since the `photo&#8217; <em>(<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/04/09/a-non-experts-guide-to-a-black-holes-silhouette/">a false-color image created to show the intensity of radio waves, not visible light</a>) </em>of the black hole at the center of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_87">the galaxy M87</a>, taken by the <a href="https://eventhorizontelescope.org/">Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration</a>, was made public. Before it was shown, I wrote <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/04/09/a-non-experts-guide-to-a-black-holes-silhouette/">an introductory post</a> explaining what the &#8216;photo&#8217; is and isn&#8217;t. There I cautioned readers that I thought it might be difficult to interpret the image, and controversies about it might erupt.<img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="10375" data-permalink="https://profmattstrassler.com/technical-zone/test-page/ehtdiscoverym87-3/" data-orig-file="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/ehtdiscoverym87-1.png" data-orig-size="800,466" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="EHTDiscoveryM87" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/ehtdiscoverym87-1.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/ehtdiscoverym87-1.png?w=500" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10375" src="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/ehtdiscoverym87-1.png?w=300&#038;h=175" alt="EHTDiscoveryM87" width="300" height="175" srcset="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/ehtdiscoverym87-1.png?w=300&amp;h=175 300w, https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/ehtdiscoverym87-1.png?w=600&amp;h=350 600w, https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/ehtdiscoverym87-1.png?w=150&amp;h=87 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>So far, the claim that the image shows the vicinity of M87&#8217;s black hole (which I&#8217;ll call `M87bh&#8217; for short) has not been challenged, and I&#8217;m not expecting it to be. But what and where exactly is the material that is emitting the radio waves and thus creating the glow in the image? And what exactly determines the size of the dark region at the center of the image? These have been problematic issues from the beginning, but discussion is starting to heat up. <strong>And it&#8217;s important: it has implications for the measurement of the black hole&#8217;s mass</strong> (which <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ab1141">EHT claims is that of 6.5 billion Suns, with an uncertainty of about 15%</a>),<strong> and for any attempt to estimate its rotation rate.</strong><span id="more-10382"></span></p>
<p>Over the last few weeks I&#8217;ve spent some time studying the mathematics of spinning black holes, talking to my Harvard colleagues who are world&#8217;s experts on the relevant math and physics, and learning from colleagues who produced the `photo&#8217; and interpreted it. So I think I can now clearly explain what most journalists and scientist-writers (including me) got wrong at the time of the photo&#8217;s publication, and clarify what the photo does and doesn&#8217;t tell us.</p>
<p>One note before I begin: this post is long. But it starts with a summary of the situation that you can read quickly, and then comes the long part: a step-by-step non-technical explanation of an important aspect of the black hole &#8216;photo&#8217; that, to my knowledge, has not yet been given anywhere else.</p>
<p><em>[I am heavily indebted to Harvard postdocs Alex Lupsasca and Shahar Hadar for assisting me as I studied the formulas and concepts relevant for fast-spinning black holes. Much of what I learned comes from early 1970s papers, especially those by my former colleague Professor Jim Bardeen (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1972ApJ...178..347B/abstract">see this one written with Press and Teukolsky</a>), and from papers written in the last couple of years, especially <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.11112">this one</a> by my present and former Harvard colleagues.]</em></p>
<p><strong>What Does the EHT Image Show?</strong></p>
<p>Scientists understand the black hole itself &#8212; the geometric dimple in space and time &#8212; pretty well. If one knows the mass and the rotation rate of the black hole, and assumes Einstein&#8217;s equations for gravity are mostly correct <em>(for which we have considerable evidence, for example <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2016/06/15/ligo-detects-a-second-merger-of-black-holes/">from LIGO measurements</a> and elsewhere), </em>then the equations tell us what the black hole does to space and time and how its gravity works.</p>
<p>But for the `photo&#8217;, ​that&#8217;s not enough information. We don&#8217;t get to observe the black hole itself (it&#8217;s black, after all!) What the `photo&#8217; shows is a blurry ring of radio waves, emitted from hot material (a <a href="https://scied.ucar.edu/plasma">plasma</a> of mostly electrons and protons) <strong>somewhere around</strong> the black hole &#8212; material whose location, velocity, and temperature we do not know. That material and its emission of radio waves are influenced by powerful gravitational forces (whose details depend on the rotation rate of the M87bh, which we don&#8217;t know yet) and powerful magnetic fields (whose details we hardly know at all.) The black hole&#8217;s gravity then causes the paths on which the radio waves travel to bend, even more than a glass lens will bend the path of visible light, so that <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/04/09/a-non-experts-guide-to-a-black-holes-silhouette/">where things appear in the &#8216;photo&#8217; is not where they are actually located.</a></p>
<p>The only insights we have into this extreme environment come from computer simulations and a few other `photos&#8217; at lower magnification. The simulations are based on well-understood equations, but the equations have to be solved approximately, using methods that may or may not be justified. And the simulations don&#8217;t tell you where the matter <strong><em>is</em></strong>; they tell you where the material <em><strong>will go, </strong></em>but only <strong>after you make a guess</strong> as to where it is located at some initial point in time. <em>(In the same sense: computers can predict the national weather tomorrow only when you tell them what the national weather was yesterday.)</em> No one knows for sure how accurate or misleading these simulations might be; they&#8217;ve been tested against some indirect measurements, but no one can say for sure what flaws they might have.</p>
<p>However, there is one thing we can certainly say, and it has just been said publicly in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00873">a paper by Samuel Gralla, Daniel Holz and Robert Wald</a>.<em><br />
</em></p>
<p>Two months ago, when the EHT `photo&#8217; appeared, it was widely reported in the popular press and on blogs that the photo shows the image of a <strong>photon sphere</strong> at the edge of the <strong>shadow</strong> of the M87bh. <em>(Instead of `shadow&#8217;, I suggested the term &#8216;<strong>quasi-silhouette</strong>&#8216;, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/04/09/a-non-experts-guide-to-a-black-holes-silhouette/"> which I viewed as somewhat less misleading to a non-expert.</a>) </em></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">Unfortunately, it seems these statements are not true; and this was well-known to (but poorly communicated by, in my opinion) the EHT folks.  This lack of clarity might perhaps annoy some scientists and science-loving non-experts; but does this issue also matter scientifically? Gralla et al., in their new preprint, suggest that it does (though they were careful to not yet make a precise claim.)</span></p>
<p><strong>The Photon Sphere Doesn&#8217;t Exist</strong>&#8230;</p>
<p>Indeed, if you happened to be reading my posts carefully when the `photo&#8217; first appeared, you probably noticed that I was quite vague about the photon-sphere &#8212; I never defined precisely what it was. You would have been right to read this as a warning sign, for indeed I wasn&#8217;t getting clear explanations of it from anyone. Studying the equations and conversing with expert colleagues, I soon learned why: <em><strong>for a rotating black hole, the photon sphere doesn&#8217;t really exist.</strong></em></p>
<p>But let&#8217;s first define what the photon sphere is for a non-rotating black hole! Like the Earth&#8217;s equator, the photon sphere is a location, not an object. This location is the surface of an imaginary ball, lying well outside the black hole&#8217;s horizon. On the photon sphere, photons (the particles that make up light, radio waves, and all other electromagnetic waves) travel on special circular or spherical orbits around the black hole.</p>
<p>By contrast, a rotating black hole has a larger, broader `photon-zone&#8217; where photons can have special orbits. But you won&#8217;t ever see the whole photon zone in any image of a rotating black hole. Instead, a piece of the photon zone will appear as a `<em><strong>photon ring</strong></em>&#8216;, a bright and very thin loop of radio waves. However,<span style="color:#800080;"> the photon ring is <strong>not</strong> the edge of anything spherical, is generally <strong>not</strong> perfectly circular, and generally is <strong>not</strong> even perfectly centered on the black hole</span><em><span style="color:#800080;">.</span><br />
</em></p>
<p><strong>&#8230; and the Photon Ring Isn&#8217;t What We See&#8230;<br />
</strong></p>
<p>It seems likely that the M87bh is rotating quite rapidly, so it has a photon-zone rather than a photon-sphere, and images of it will have a photon ring. Ok, fine; but then, can we interpret EHT&#8217;s `photo&#8217; simply as showing the photon ring, blurred by the imperfections in the `telescope&#8217;? Although some of the EHT folks have seemed to suggest the answer is &#8220;yes&#8221;, Gralla et al. suggest the answer is likely &#8220;no&#8221; <em>(and many of their colleagues have been pointing out the same thing in private.)</em> <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em><strong>The circlet of radio waves that appears in the EHT `photo&#8217; is probably not simply a blurred image of M87bh&#8217;s photon ring; it probably shows a combination of the photon ring with something brighter </strong>(as explained below).</em></span> That&#8217;s where the controversy starts.</p>
<p><strong>&#8230;so the Dark Patch May Not Be the Full Shadow&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>The term `shadow&#8217; is confusing (which is why I prefer `quasi-silhouette&#8217; in describing it in public contexts, though that&#8217;s my own personal term) but no matter what you call it, in its ideal form it is supposed to be an absolutely dark area whose edge is the photon ring. But in reality the perfectly dark area need not appear so dark after all; it may be partly filled in by various effects. Furthermore, since the `photo&#8217; may not show us the photon ring, it&#8217;s far from clear that the dark patch in the center is the full shadow anyway. The EHT folks are well aware of this, but at the time the photo came out, many science writers and scientist-writers (including me) were not.</p>
<p><strong>&#8230;so EHT&#8217;s Measurement of the M87bh&#8217;s Mass is Being Questioned</strong></p>
<p>It was wonderful that EHT could make a picture that could travel round the internet at the speed of light, and generate justifiable excitement and awe that human beings could indirectly observe such an amazing thing as a black hole with a mass of several billion Sun-like stars. Qualitatively, they achieved something fantastic in showing that yes, the object at the center of M87 really is as compact and dark as such a black hole would be expected to be! But the EHT telescope&#8217;s main <strong><em>quantitative</em></strong> achievement was <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ab1141">a measurement of the mass of the M87bh</a>, with a claimed precision of about 15%.</p>
<p>Naively, one could imagine that the mass is measured by looking at the diameter of the dark spot in the black hole &#8216;photo&#8217;, under the assumption that it is the black hole&#8217;s shadow. So here&#8217;s the issue: <em><strong>Could interpreting the dark region incorrectly perhaps lead to a significant mistake in the mass measurement, and/or an underestimate of how uncertain the mass measurement actually is?</strong></em></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know.  The EHT folks are certainly aware of these issues; their simulations show them explicitly.  The mass of the M87bh isn&#8217;t literally measured by putting a ruler on the &#8216;photo&#8217; and measuring the size of the dark spot! The actual methods are much more sophisticated than that, and I don&#8217;t understand them well enough yet to explain, evaluate or criticize them. All I can say with confidence right now is that these are important questions that experts currently are debating, and consensus on the answer may not be achieved for quite a while.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p><strong>The Appearance of a Black Hole With Nearby Matter</strong></p>
<p>Ok, now I&#8217;m going to explain the most relevant points, step-by-step. Grab a cup of coffee or tea, find a comfy chair, and bear with me.</p>
<p>Because fast-rotating black holes are more complicated, I&#8217;m going to start illuminating the controversy by looking at a <strong>non-rotating</strong> black hole&#8217;s properties, which is also what Gralla et al. mainly do in their paper. It turns out the qualitative conclusion drawn from the non-rotating case largely applies in the rotating case too, at least in the case of the M87bh as seen from our perspective; that&#8217;s important because the M87bh may well be rotating at a very good clip.</p>
<p>A little terminology first: for a rotating black hole there&#8217;s a natural definition of the poles and the equator, just as there is for the Earth: there&#8217;s an axis of rotation, and the poles are where that axis intersects with the black hole horizon. The equator is the circle that lies halfway between the poles. For a non-rotating black hole, there&#8217;s no such axis and no such automatic definition, but it will be useful to define the north pole of the black hole to be the point on the horizon closest to us.</p>
<p><strong>A Single Source of Electromagnetic Waves</strong></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s imagine placing a bright light bulb on the same plane as the equator, outside the black hole horizon but rather close to it. <em>(The bulb could emit radio waves or visible light or any other form of electromagnetic waves, at any frequency; for what I&#8217;m about to say, it doesn&#8217;t matter at all, so I&#8217;ll just call it `light&#8217;.)</em> See Figure 1. Where will the light from the bulb go?</p>
<p>Some of it, heading inward, ends up in the black hole, while some of it heads outward toward distant observers. The gravity of the black hole will bend the path of the light. And here&#8217;s something remarkable: a small fraction of the light, aimed just so, can actually spiral around the black hole any number of times before heading out. As a result, you will see the bulb not once but multiple times!</p>
<p>There will be a direct image &#8212; light that comes directly to us &#8212; from near the bulb&#8217;s true location (displaced because gravity bends the light a bit, just as a glass lens will distort the appearance of what&#8217;s behind it.) That path of that light is the orange arrow in Figure 1. But then there will be an <strong>indirect</strong> image (the green arrow in Figure 1) from light that goes halfway around the black hole before heading in our direction; we will see that image of the bulb on the opposite side of the black hole. Let&#8217;s call that the `first indirect image.&#8217; Then there will be a second indirect image from light that orbits the black hole once and comes out near the direct image, but further out; that&#8217;s the blue arrow in Figure 1. Then there will be a third indirect image from light that goes around one and a half times (not shown), and so on. In short, Figure 1 shows the paths of the direct, first indirect, and second indirect images of the bulb as they head toward our location at the top of the image.</p>

For light to make orbits of the black hole, it must travel near the grey-dashed circle that indicates the location of a &#8220;photon-sphere.&#8221; (A rotating black hole has no such sphere, but when seen from the north or south pole, the light observed takes similar paths to what is shown in this figure.) <em>[The paths of the light rays were calculated carefully using Mathematica 11.3.]</em></p></div>What you can see in Figure 1 is that both the first and second indirect images are formed by light that spends part of its time close to a special radius around the back hole, shown as a dotted line. This imaginary surface, the edge of a ball,  is an honest &#8220;photon-sphere&#8221; in the case of a <strong><em>non-rotating</em></strong> black hole.</p>
<p>In the case of a <strong><em>rotating</em></strong> black hole, something very similar happens <strong>when you&#8217;re looking at the black hole from its north (or south) pole</strong>; there&#8217;s a special circle then too. But that circle is <em><strong>not</strong></em> the edge of a photon-sphere! In general, photons can have special orbits in a wide region, which I called the &#8220;photon-zone&#8221; earlier, and only a small set of them are on this circle. You&#8217;ll see photons from other parts of the photon zone if you look at the black hole not from the poles but from some other angle.</p>
<p><em>[If you&#8217;d like to learn a bit more about the photon zone, and you have a little bit of knowledge of black holes already, you can profit from exploring this demo by Professor Leo Stein: <a href="https://duetosymmetry.com/tool/kerr-circular-photon-orbits/">https://duetosymmetry.com/tool/kerr-circular-photon-orbits/</a> ]</em></p>
<p>Back to the non-rotating case: What our camera will see, looking at what is emitted from the light bulb, is shown in Figure 2: an infinite number of increasingly squished `indirect&#8217; images, half on one side of the black hole near the direct image, and the other half on the other side. What is not obvious, but true, is that only the first of the indirect images is large and bright; this is one of Gralla <em>et al.</em>&#8216;s main points. We can, therefore, separate the images into the direct image, the first indirect image, and the remaining indirect images. The total amount of light coming from the direct image and the first indirect image can be large, but the total amount of light from the remaining indirect images is typically (according to Gralla <em>et al.</em>) less than 5% of the light from the first indirect image. And so, unless we have an extremely high-powered camera, we&#8217;ll never pick those other images up. <strong>Let&#8217;s therefore focus our attention on the direct image and the first indirect image.</strong></p>

<p><strong>A Circular Source of Electromagnetic Waves</strong></p>
<p>Proceeding step by step toward a more realistic situation, let&#8217;s replace our ordinary bulb by a circular bulb (Figure 3), again set somewhat close to the horizon, sitting in the plane that contains the equator. What would we see now?</p>

<p>That&#8217;s shown in Figure 4: the direct image is a circle (looking somewhat larger than it really is); outside it sits the first indirect image of the ring; and then come all the other indirect images, looking quite dim and all piling up at one radius.

<p>Importantly, if we consider circular bulbs of different diameter [yellow, red and blue in Figure 5], then although the direct images reflect the differences in the bulbs&#8217; diameters (somewhat enlarged by lensing), the first indirect images <strong>all are about the same diameter</strong>, just a tad larger or smaller than the photon ring.  The remaining indirect images all sit together at the radius of the photon ring.</p>

<p>These statements are also essentially true for a rotating black hole seen from the north or south pole; a circular bulb generates a series of circular images, and the indirect images all pile more or less on top of each other, forming a photon ring. When viewed off the poles, the rotating black hole becomes a more complicated story, but as long as the viewing angle is small enough, the changes are relatively minor and the picture is qualitatively somewhat similar.</p>
<p><strong>A Disk as a Source of Electromagnetic Waves</strong></p>
<p>And what if you replaced the circular bulb with a disk-shaped bulb, a sort of glowing pancake with a circular hole at its center, as in Figure 7? That&#8217;s relevant because black holes are thought to have `accretion disks&#8217; made of material orbiting the black hole, and eventually spiraling in. The accretion disk may well be the dominant source emitting radio waves at the M87bh. <em>(I&#8217;m showing a very thin uniform disk for illustration, but a real accretion disk is not uniform, changes rapidly as clumps of material move within it and then spiral into the black hole, and may be quite thick &#8212; as thick as the black hole is wide, or even thicker.)</em></p>
<p>Well, we can think of the disk as many concentric circles of light placed together. The direct images of the disk (shown in Figure 6 left, on one side of the disk, as an orange wash) would form a disk in your camera, the dim red region in Figure 6 right; the hole at its center would appear larger than it really is due to the bending caused by the black hole&#8217;s gravity, but the shape would be similar. However, the indirect images would all pile up in almost the same place from your perspective, forming a bright and quite thin ring, the bright yellow circle in Figure 6 right. (The path of the disk&#8217;s first indirect image is shown in Figure 6 left, going halfway about the black hole as a green wash; notice how it narrows as it travels, which is why it appears as a narrow ring in the image at right.) This circle &#8212; the full set of indirect images of the whole disk &#8212; is the edge of the photon-sphere for a non-rotating black hole, and the circular photon ring for a rotating black hole viewed from its north or south pole.</p>

The direct image of the disk forms a disk (illustrated at left, for a piece of the disk, as an orange wash) while the first indirect image becomes highly compressed (illustrated, for a piece of the disk, as a green wash) and is seen as a narrow circle of bright light.  <em><span style="color:#008000;">(It is expected that the disk is mostly transparent in radio waves, so the indirect image can pass through it.)</span></em> That circle, along with the other indirect images, forms the photon ring. In this case, because the disk&#8217;s inner edge lies close to the black hole horizon, the photon ring sits within the disk&#8217;s direct image, but we&#8217;ll see a different example in Figure 9.</p></div>
<p><span style="color:#808080;"><em>[Gralla et al. call the first indirect image the `lensed ring&#8217; and the remaining indirect images, currently unobservable at EHT, the `photon ring&#8217;, while EHT refers to <strong>all</strong> the indirect images as the `photon ring&#8217;. Just letting you know in case you hear `lensed ring&#8217; referred to in future.]</em></span></p>
<p>So the conclusion is that if we had a perfect camera, the direct image of a disk makes a disk, but the indirect images (mainly just the first one, as Gralla et al. emphasize) make a bright, thin ring that may be superposed upon the direct image of the disk, depending on the disk&#8217;s shape.</p>
<p>And this conclusion, with some important adjustments, applies also for a spinning black hole viewed from above its north or south pole &#8212; i.e., along its axis of rotation &#8212; or from near that axis; I&#8217;ll mention the adjustments in a moment.</p>
<p>But EHT is not a perfect camera. To make the black hole image, technology had to be pushed to its absolute limits. Someday we&#8217;ll see both the disk and the ring, but right now, they&#8217;re all blurred together. So which one is more important?</p>
<p><strong>From a Blurry Image to Blurry Knowledge</strong></p>
<p>What does a blurry camera do to this simple image? You might think that the disk is so dim and the ring so bright that the camera will mainly show you a blurry image of the bright photon ring. But that&#8217;s wrong. The ring isn&#8217;t bright enough. A simple calculation reveals that the ​photo will show mainly the disk, not the photon ring! This is shown in Figure 9, which you can compare with the Black Hole `photo&#8217; (Figure 10). <em>(Figure 9 is symmetric around the ring, but the photo is not, for multiple reasons &#8212; Doppler-like effect from rotation, viewpoint off the rotation axis, etc. &#8212; which I&#8217;ll have to defer til another post.)</em></p>
<p>More precisely, <em><strong>the ring and disk blur together, but the brightness of the image is dominated by the disk, not the ring.<br />
</strong></em></p>

<p>Let&#8217;s say that again: the black hole `photo&#8217; may mainly show the M87bh&#8217;s accretion disk, with the photon ring contributing only some of the light, <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em><strong>and therefore the photon ring does not completely and unambiguously determine the radius of the observed dark patch in the `photo​.&#8217; <span style="color:#800000;"><span style="color:#000000;">In general, the patch</span> <span style="color:#ff0000;">could be considerably smaller</span> <span style="color:#000000;">than what is usually termed the `shadow&#8217; of the black hole.</span></span><br />

Its accretion disk has an unknown size and shape — it may be quite thick and non-uniform — and it may not even lie at the black hole’s equator. The disk and the black hole interact to create outward-going jets of material (observed already many years ago but not clearly visible in the EHT ‘photo’.) (Right) The EHT `photo’ of the M87bh (taken in radio waves and shown in false color!) Compare with Figure 7; the most important difference is that one side of the image is brighter than the other. This likely arises from (a) our view being slightly off from the south pole, combined with (b) rotation of the black hole and its disk, and (c) possibly other more subtle issues.</p></div>
<p>This is important. The photon ring&#8217;s diameter, and thus the width of the `shadow&#8217; too, barely depend on the rotation rate of the black hole; they depend almost exclusively on the black hole&#8217;s mass. So <em><strong>if the ring in the photo were simply the photon ring of the M87bh, you&#8217;d have a very simple way to measure the black hole&#8217;s mass without knowing its rotation rate</strong></em>: you&#8217;d look at how large the dark patch is, or equivalently, the diameter of the blurry ring, and that would give you the answer to within 10%. But it&#8217;s nowhere near so simple if the blurry ring shows the accretion disk, because the accretion disk&#8217;s properties and appearance can vary much more than the photon ring; they can depend strongly on the black hole&#8217;s rotation rate, and also on magnetic fields and other details of the black hole&#8217;s vicinity.</p>
<p><strong>The Important Role of Rotation</strong></p>
<p>If we conclude that EHT is seeing a mix of the accretion disk with the photon ring, with the former dominating the brightness, then this makes EHT&#8217;s measurement of the M87bh&#8217;s mass more confusing and even potentially suspect. Hence: controversy. Is it possible that EHT underestimated their uncertainties, and that their measurement of the black hole mass has more ambiguities, and is not as precise, as they currently claim?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s where the rotation rate is important. <span style="color:#008000;">Despite what I showed (for pedagogical simplicity) in Figure 7</span>, for a non-rotating black hole the accretion disk&#8217;s central gap is <span style="color:#008000;">actually</span> expected to lie <strong>outside</strong> the photon ring; this is shown at the top of Figure 9.  But  the faster the black hole rotates, the smaller this central gap is expected to be, to the point that for a fast-rotating black hole the gap will lie <strong>inside</strong> the photon ring, <span style="color:#008000;">as shown at the bottom of Figure 9.</span> <em>(This tendency is not obvious; it requires understanding details of the black hole geometry.)</em> And if that is true, the dark patch in the EHT image may not be the black hole&#8217;s full shadow (i.e. quasi-silhouette), which is the region inside the photon ring. <strong>It may be just the inner portion of it, with the outer portion obscured by emission from the accretion disk.</strong></p>
<p>The <span style="color:#008000;">effect of blurring in the</span> two cases of slow (or zero) and fast rotation are illustrated in Figure 9, where the photon ring&#8217;s size is taken to be the same in each case but the disk&#8217;s inner edge is close in or far out. (The black holes, not illustrated since they aren&#8217;t visible anyway, differ in mass by about 10% in order to have the photon ring the same size.) This shows why the size of the dark patch can be quite different, depending on the disk&#8217;s shape, even when the photon ring&#8217;s size is the same.</p>

(Left) the view in a perfect camera; (right) rough illustration of the effect of blurring in the current version of the EHT. The faster the black hole is spinning, the smaller the central gap in the accretion disk is likely to be. No matter what the extent of the accretion disk (dark red), the photon ring (yellow) remains at roughly the same location, changing only by 10% between a non-rotating black hole and a maximally rotating black hole of the same mass. But blurring in the camera combines the disk and photon ring into a thick ring whose brightness is dominated by the disk rather than the ring, and which can therefore be of different size even though the mass is the same. This implies that the radius of the blurry ring in the EHT `photo’, and the size of the dark region inside it, cannot by themselves tell us the black hole’s mass; at a minimum we must also know the rotation rate (which we do not.)</p></div>
<p>Gralla et al. subtly raise these questions but are careful not to overstate their case, perhaps because they have not yet completed their study of rotating black holes. But the question is now in the air.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m interested to hear what the EHT folks have to say about it, as I&#8217;m sure they have detailed arguments in favor of their procedures. In particular, <strong>EHT&#8217;s simulations show all of the effects mentioned above; there&#8217;s none of this of which they are unaware.</strong> (In fact, the reason I know my illustrations above are reasonable is partly because you can see similar pictures <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ab0f43">in the EHT papers.</a>) As long as the EHT folks correctly accounted for all the issues, then they should have been able to properly measure the mass and estimate their uncertainties correctly. <strong><em>In fact, they don&#8217;t really use the photo itself; they use more subtle techniques applied to their telescope data directly. </em></strong>Thus it&#8217;s not enough to argue the photo itself is ambiguous; one has to argue that EHT&#8217;s more subtle analysis methods are flawed. No one has argued that yet, as far as I am aware.</p>
<p>But the one thing that&#8217;s clear right now is that science writers almost uniformly got it wrong <em>[because the experts didn&#8217;t explain these points well]</em> when they tried to describe the image two months ago. The `photo&#8217; probably does not show &#8220;a photon ring surrounding a shadow.&#8221; That would be nice and simple and impressive-sounding, since it refers to fundamental properties of the black hole&#8217;s warping effects on space. But it&#8217;s far too glib, as Figures 7 and 9 show. We&#8217;re probably seeing an accretion disk supplemented by a photon ring, all blurred together, and the dark region may well be smaller than the black hole&#8217;s shadow.</p>
<p><em>(Rather than, or in addition to, the accretion disk, it is also possible that the dominant emission in the photo comes from the inner portion of one of the jets that emerges from the vicinity of the black hole; see Figure 8 above. This is another detail that makes the situation more difficult to interpret, but doesn&#8217;t change the main point I&#8217;m making.)</em></p>
<p>Someday in the not distant future, improved imaging should allow EHT to separately image the photon ring and the disk, so both can be observed easily, as in the left side of Figure 9. Then all these questions will be answered definitively.</p>
<p><strong>Why the Gargantua Black Hole from <em>Interstellar</em> is Completely Different</strong></p>
<p>Just as a quick aside, what would you see if an accretion disk were edge-on rather than face-on? Then, in a perfect camera, you&#8217;d see something like the famous picture of Gargantua, the black hole from the movie <em>Interstellar</em> &#8212; a direct image of the front edge of the disk, and a strongly lensed indirect image of the back side of the disk, appearing both above and below the black hole, as illustrated in Figure 11. And that leads to the Gargantua image from the movie, also shown in Figure 11. Notice the photon ring (which is, as I cautioned you earlier, off-center!)   <em><span style="color:#339966;">[Note added: this figure has been modified; in the original version I referred to the top and bottom views of the disk&#8217;s far side as the  &#8220;1st indirect image&#8221;, but as pointed out by Professor Jean-Pierre Luminet, that&#8217;s not correct terminology here.]</span> </em></p>

As a result, the direct image of the disk cuts across the black hole, and indirect images of the back side of the disk are seen above and below the black hole. There is also a bright photon ring, slightly off center; this is well outside the surface of the black hole, which is not visible. A real image would not be symmetric left-to-right; it would be brighter on the side that is rotating toward the viewer.  <span style="color:#339966;">At the bottom is shown a much more realistic visual image (albeit not so good quality) from 1994 by Jean-Alain Marck, in which this asymmetry can be seen clearly.</span></p></div>
<p>However, the movie image leaves out an important Doppler-like effect (which I&#8217;ll explain someday when I understand it 100%). This makes the part of the disk that is rotating toward us bright, and the part rotating away from us dim&#8230; and so a real image from this vantage point would be very asymmetric &#8212; bright on the left, dim on the right &#8212; unlike the movie image. <span style="color:#339966;"> At the suggestion of Professsor Jean-Pierre Luminet I have added, at the bottom of Figure 10, a very early simulation by Jean-Alain Marck that shows this effect.</span></p>
<p>I mention this because a number of expert science journalists incorrectly explained the M87 image by referring to Gargantua &#8212; but that image has essentially <em><strong>nothing</strong></em> to do with the recent black hole `photo&#8217;. M87&#8217;s accretion disk is certainly not edge-on. The movie&#8217;s Gargantua image is taken from the equator, not from near the pole.</p>
<p><strong>Final Remarks: Where a Rotating Black Hole Differs from a Non-Rotating One<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Before I quit for the week, I&#8217;ll just summarize a few big differences for fast-rotating black holes compared to non-rotating ones.</p>
<p>1) As I&#8217;ve just emphasized, what a rotating black hole looks like to a distant observer depends not only on where the matter around the black hole is located but also on how the black hole&#8217;s rotation axis is oriented relative to the observer. A pole observer, an equatorial observer, and a near-pole observer see quite different things. (As noted in Figure 8, we are apparently near-south-pole observers for M87&#8217;s black hole.)</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s assume that the accretion disk lies in the same plane as the black hole&#8217;s equator &#8212; there are some reasons to expect this. Even then, the story is complex.</p>
<p>2) As I mentioned above, instead of a photon-sphere, there is a &#8216;photon-zone&#8217; &#8212; a region where specially aimed photons can travel round the black hole multiple times. For high-enough spin (greater than about 80% of maximum as I recall), an accretion disk&#8217;s inner edge can lie within the photon zone, or even closer to the black hole than the photon zone; and this can cause a filling-in of the &#8216;shadow&#8217;.</p>
<p>3) Depending on the viewing angle, the indirect images of the disk that form the photon ring may not be a circle, and may not be concentric with the direct image of the disk. Only when viewed from along the rotation axis (i.e., above the north or south pole) will the direct and indirect images of the disk all be circular and concentric. We&#8217;re not viewing the M87bh on its axis, and that further complicates interpretation of the blurry image.</p>
<p>4) When the viewing angle is not along the rotation axis the image will be asymmetric, brighter on one side than the other. (This is true of EHT&#8217;s `photo&#8217;.) However, I know of at least four potential causes of this asymmetry, any or all of which might play a role, and the degree of asymmetry depends on properties of the accretion disk and the rotation rate of the black hole, both of which are currently unknown. Claims about the asymmetry made by the EHT folks seem, at least to me, to be based on certain assumptions that I, at least, cannot currently check.</p>
<p>Each of these complexities is a challenge to explain, so I&#8217;ll give both you and I a substantial break while I figure out how best to convey what is known (at least to me) about these issues.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>[Note added April 16: some minor improvements have been made to this article as my understanding has increased, specifically concerning the photon-sphere, which is the main region from which the radio waves are seen in the recently released image. See later blog posts for the image and its interpretation.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Note added June 14: significant misconceptions concerning the photon-sphere and shadow, as relevant to the black hole &#8216;photo&#8217;, dominated reporting in April, and I myself was also subject to them.  <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/06/14/a-ring-of-controversy-around-a-black-hole-photo">I have explained the origin of and correction to these misconceptions, which affect the interpretation of the image, in my post &#8220;A Ring of Controversy&#8221;.</a>]</em></p>
<p>About fifteen years ago, when I was a professor at the University of Washington, the particle physics theorists and the astronomer theorists occasionally would arrange to have lunch together, to facilitate an informal exchange of information about our adjacent fields. Among the many enjoyable discussions, one I was particularly excited about &#8212; as much as an amateur as a professional &#8212; was that in which I learned of the plan to make some sort of image of a black hole. I was told that this incredible feat would likely be achieved by 2020. <a href="https://eventhorizontelescope.org/blog/media-advisory-first-results-event-horizon-telescope-be-presented-april-10th">The time, it seems, has arrived.</a></p>
<p>The goal of this post is to provide readers with what I hope will be a helpful guide through the foggy swamp that is likely to partly obscure this major scientific result. Over the last days I&#8217;ve been reading what both scientists and science journalists are writing in advance of the press conference Wednesday morning, and I&#8217;m finding many examples of jargon masquerading as English, terms poorly defined, and phrasing that seems likely to mislead. As I&#8217;m increasingly concerned that many non-experts will be unable to understand what is presented tomorrow, and what the pictures do and do not mean, I&#8217;m using this post to answer a few questions that many readers (and many of these writers) have perhaps not thought to ask.<span id="more-10241"></span></p>
<p>A caution: I am not an expert on this subject. At the moment, I&#8217;m still learning about the more subtle issues. I&#8217;ll try to be clear about when I&#8217;m on the edge of my knowledge, and hopefully won&#8217;t make any blunders <em>[but experts, please point them out if you see any!]</em></p>
<p><strong>Which black holes are being imaged?</strong></p>
<p>The initial plan behind the so-called &#8220;Event Horizon Telescope&#8221; <em>(the name deserves some discussion; see below)</em> has been to make images of two black holes at the centers of galaxies (the star-cities in which most stars are found.) These are not black holes formed by the collapse of individual stars, such as the ones whose collisions have been <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2016/02/11/advance-thoughts-on-ligo/">observed through their gravitational waves</a>. <em><strong>Central galactic black holes are millions or even billions of times larger!</strong></em>  The ones being observed are</p>
<ol>
<li>the large and `close&#8217; black hole at the center of the Milky Way (the giant star-city we call home), and</li>
<li>the immense but much more distant back hole at the center of M87 (a spectacularly big star-megalopolis.)</li>

<p>Why go after both of these black holes at the same time? Just as the Sun and Moon appear the same size in our sky because of an accident &#8212; the Sun&#8217;s greater distance is almost precisely compensated by its greater size &#8212; these two black holes appear similarly sized, albeit very tiny, from our vantage point.</p>
<p>Our galaxy&#8217;s central black hole has a mass of about four million Suns, and its size is about twenty times wider than our Sun (in contrast to the black holes whose gravitational waves were observed, which are the size of a human city.) But from the center of our galaxy, it takes light tens of thousands of years to reach Earth, and at such a great distance, this big black hole appears as small as would a tiny grain of sand from a plane at cruising altitude. Try to see the sand grains on a beach from a plane window!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, although M87 lies about two thousand times further away, its central black hole has a mass and radius about two thousand times larger than our galaxy&#8217;s black hole. Consequently it appears roughly the same size on the sky.</p>
<p>We may get our first images of both black holes at Wednesday&#8217;s announcement, though it is possible that so far only one image is ready for public presentation.</p>
<p><strong>How can one see something as black as a black hole?!?</strong></p>
<p>First of all, aren&#8217;t black holes black? Doesn&#8217;t that mean they don&#8217;t emit (or reflect) any light? Yes, and yes. <em>[With a caveat &#8212; Hawking radiation &#8212; but while that&#8217;s very important for extremely small black holes, it&#8217;s completely irrelevant for these ones.]</em></p>
<p>So how can we see something that&#8217;s black against a black night sky? Well, a black hole off by itself would indeed be almost invisible.  <em>[Though detectable because its gravity bends the light of objects behind it, proving it was a black hole and not a clump of, say, dark matter would be tough.]</em></p>
<p>But the centers of galaxies have lots of `gas&#8217; &#8212; not quite what we call `gas&#8217; in school, and certainly not what we put in our cars. `Gas&#8217; is the generalized term astronomers use for any collection of independently wandering atoms (or ions), atomic nuclei, and electrons; if it&#8217;s not just atoms it should really be called <em>plasma</em>, but let&#8217;s not worry about that here. Some of this `gas&#8217; is inevitably orbiting the black hole, and some of it is falling in (and, because of complex interactions with magnetic fields, some is being blasted outward  before it falls in.) That gas, unlike the black hole, <em><strong>will inevitably glow</strong></em> &#8212; it will emit lots of light. <strong>What the astronomers are observing isn&#8217;t the black hole; they&#8217;re observing light from the gas!</strong></p>
<p>And by light, I don&#8217;t only mean what we can see with human eyes. The gas emits electromagnetic waves of all frequencies, including not only the visible frequencies but also much higher frequencies, such as those we call X-rays, and much lower frequencies, such as those we call radio waves. To detect these invisible forms of light, astronomers build all sorts of scientific instruments, which we call them `telescopes&#8217; even though they don&#8217;t involve looking into a tube as with traditional telescopes.</p>
<p><strong>Is this really a &#8220;photograph&#8221; of <em>[the gas in the neighborhood of]</em> a black hole?</strong></p>
<p>Yes and (mostly) no.  What you&#8217;ll be shown is not a picture you could take with a cell-phone camera if you were in a nearby spaceship.  It&#8217;s not visible light that&#8217;s being observed.  But it is invisible light &#8212; radio waves &#8212; and since all light, visible and not, is made from particles called `photons&#8217;, technically you could still say is a &#8220;photo&#8221;-graph.</p>
<p>As I said, the telescope being used in this doesn&#8217;t have a set of mirrors in a tube like your friendly neighbor&#8217;s amateur telescope. Instead, it uses radio receivers to detect electromagnetic waves that have frequencies above what your traditional radio or cell phone can detect<em> [in the hundred gigahertz range, over a thousand times above what your FM radio is sensitive to.]</em>  Though some might call them microwaves, let&#8217;s just call them radio waves; it&#8217;s just a matter of definition.</p>
<p>So the images you will see are based on the observation of electromagnetic waves at these radio frequencies, but they are turned into something visible for us humans using a computer. That means <strong><em>the color of the image is inserted by the computer user and will be arbitrary,</em></strong> so pay it limited attention. It&#8217;s not the color you would see if you were nearby.  <em><strong>Scientists will choose a combination of the color and brightness of the image so as to indicate the brightness of the radio waves observed.</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="color:var(--color-neutral-600);">If you were nearby and looked toward the black hole, you&#8217;d see something else. The gas would probably appear colorless &#8212; white-hot &#8212; and the shape and brightness, though similar, wouldn&#8217;t be identical.</span></p>
<p><strong>If I had radios for eyes, is this what I would see?</strong></p>
<p>Suppose you had radio receivers for eyes instead of the ones you were born with; is this image what you would see if you looked at the black hole from a nearby planet?</p>
<p>Well, to some extent &#8212; but still, not exactly.  There&#8217;s another very important way that what you will see is not a photograph. It is so difficult to make this measurement that <strong><em>the image you will see is highly processed</em></strong> &#8212; that is to say, it will have been cleaned up and adjusted using special mathematics and powerful computers. Various assumptions are key ingredients in this image-processing. Thus, you will not be seeing the `true&#8217; appearance of the [surroundings of the] black hole. <em><strong>You will be seeing the astronomers&#8217; best guess</strong></em> as to this appearance based on partial information and some very intelligent guesswork. Such guesswork may be right, but as we may learn only over time, some of it may not be.</p>
<p>This guesswork is necessary.  To make a nice clear image of something so tiny and faint using radio waves, you&#8217;d naively need a radio receiver as large as the Earth. A trick astronomers use when looking at distant objects it to build gigantic <strong><em>arrays</em></strong> of large radio receivers, which can be combined together to make a `telescope&#8217; much larger and more powerful than any one receiver. The tricks for doing this efficiently are beyond what I can explain here, but involve the term `<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very-long-baseline_interferometry">interferometry</a>&#8216;. Examples of large radio telescope arrays include ALMA, the center part of which can be <a href="https://www.almaobservatory.org/en/images/aerial-view-of-antennas-in-aos-4/">seen in this image</a>, which was built high up on a plateau between two volcanoes in the Atacama desert.</p>
<p>But even ALMA isn&#8217;t up to the task. And we can&#8217;t make a version of ALMA that covers the Earth. So the next best thing is to use ALMA and all of its friends, which are scattered at different locations around the Earth &#8212; <em><strong>an incomplete array of single and multiple radio receivers, combined using all the tricks of interferometry.</strong></em> This is a bit like (and not like) using a telescope that is powerful but has large pieces of its lens missing. You can get an image, but it will be badly distorted.</p>
<p>To figure out what you&#8217;re seeing, you must use your knowledge of your imperfect lens, and <strong><em>work backwards to figure our what your distorted image really would have looked like</em></strong> if you had a perfect lens.</p>
<p>Even that&#8217;s not quite enough: to do this, you need to have a pretty good guess about what you were going to see. That is where you might go astray; <em><strong>if your assumptions are wrong, you might massage the image to look like what you expected instead of how it really ought to look.</strong></em>  <em> [Is this a serious risk?   I&#8217;m not yet expert enough to know the details of how delicate the situation might be.]</em></p>
<p>It is possible that in coming days and weeks there will be controversies about whether the image-processing techniques used and the assumptions underlying them have created artifacts in the images that really shouldn&#8217;t be there, or removed features that should have been there. This could lead to significant disagreements as to how to interpret the images. <em>[Consider these concerns a statement of general prudence based on past experience; I don&#8217;t have enough specific expertise here to give a more detailed opinion.]</em></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff6600;">So in summary, <strong>this is not a photograph you&#8217;d see with your eyes, and it&#8217;s not a complete unadulterated image</strong> &#8212; it&#8217;s a highly-processed image of what a creature with radio eyes might see.  The color is arbitrary; some combination of color and brightness will express the intensity of the radio waves, nothing more.  Treat the images with proper caution and respect.</span></p>
<p><strong>Will the image show what <em>[the immediate neighborhood of]</em> a black hole looks like?</strong></p>
<p>Oh, my friends and colleagues! Could we please try to be a little more careful using the phrase `<strong>looks like</strong>&#8216;? The term has two very different meanings, and in contexts like this one, it really, really matters.</p>
<p>Let me put a spoon into a glass of water: on the left, I&#8217;ve drawn a diagram of what it <strong><span style="color:#008000;">looks like</span></strong>, and on the right, I&#8217;ve put a photograph of what it <span style="color:#993366;"><em><strong>looks like</strong></em></span>.</p>

<p>You notice the difference, no doubt. The spoon on the left looks like a spoon; the spoon on the right looks like something invented by a surrealist painter.  But it&#8217;s just the effect of water and glass on light.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s on the left is a drawing of where the spoon is located inside the glass; it shows not what you would see with your eyes, but rather <strong>a depiction of the `true location&#8217; of the spoon</strong>. On the right is what you will see with your eyes and brain, which is not showing you where the objects are in truth but rather is <strong>showing you where the light from those objects is coming from</strong>. The truth-depiction is drawn as though the light from the object goes straight from the object into your eyes. But <em><strong>when the light from an object does not take a straight path from the objects to you</strong></em> &#8212; as in this case, where the light&#8217;s path bends due to interaction of the light with the water and the glass &#8212; <em><strong>then</strong></em> <em><strong>the image created in your eyes or camera can significantly differ from a depiction of the truth.</strong></em></p>
<p>The same issue arises, of course, with any sort of lens or mirror that isn&#8217;t flat. A room seen through a curved lens, or through an old, misshapen window pane, can look pretty strange.  And gravity? <em><strong>Strong gravity near a black hole drastically modifies the path of any light traveling close by!</strong></em></p>
<p>In the figure below, the left panel shows a depiction of what we think the region around a black hole typically looks like <em><strong>in truth</strong></em>. There is a spinning disk of gas, called the accretion disk, a sort of holding station for the gas. At any moment, a small fraction of the gas, at the inner edge of the disk, has crept too close to the black hole and is starting to spiral in. There are also usually jets of material flying out, roughly aligned with the axis of the black hole&#8217;s rapid rotation and its magnetic field. As I mentioned above, that material is being flung out of the black hole&#8217;s neighborhood (not out of the black hole itself, which would be impossible.)</p>

That is an image of the radio waves as observed here at Earth, after the waves&#8217; paths have been wildly bent &#8212; warped by the intense gravity near the black hole. Just as with any lens or mirror or anything similar, what you will see does not directly reveal what is truly there. Instead, <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em><strong>you must infer what is there from what you see.</strong></em></span></p>
<p>Just as you infer, when you see the broken twisted spoon in the glass, that probably the spoon is not broken or twisted, and the water and glass have refracted the light in familiar ways, so too we must make assumptions to understand what we&#8217;re really looking at in truth after we see the images tomorrow.</p>
<p>How serious are these assumptions?  Certainly, at their first attempt, astronomers will assume Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity, which predicts how the light is bent around a black hole, is correct. But the details of what we infer from what we&#8217;re shown might depend upon whether Einstein&#8217;s formulas are precisely right. It also may depend on the accuracy of our understanding of and assumptions about accretion disks. Further complicating the procedure is that the rate and axis of the black hole&#8217;s rotation affects the details of the bending of the light, and since we&#8217;re not sure of the rotation yet for these black holes, that adds to the assumptions that must gradually be disentangled.</p>
<p><span style="color:#993366;"><strong><em>Because of these assumptions, we will not have an unambiguous understanding of the true nature of what appears in these first images.</em></strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Are we seeing the `shadow&#8217; of a black hole?</strong></p>
<p>A shadow: that&#8217;s what astronomers call it, but as far as I can tell, this word is jargon masquerading as English&#8230; the most pernicious type of jargon.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s a shadow, in English? Your shadow is a dark area on the ground created by you blocking the light from the Sun, which emits light and illuminates the area around you. How would I see your shadow? I&#8217;d look at the ground &#8212; not at you.</p>
<p>This is not what we are doing in this case. The gas is glowing, illuminating the region. The black hole is `blocking&#8217; <em>[caution! see below]</em> some of the light. We&#8217;re looking straight toward the black hole, and seeing dark areas where illumination doesn&#8217;t reach us. This is more like looking at someone&#8217;s silhouette, not someone&#8217;s shadow!</p>

<p>Note also that the black hole&#8217;s quasi-silhouette probably won&#8217;t be entirely dark. If material from the accretion disk (or a jet pointing toward us) lies between us and the black hole, it can emit light in our direction, partly filling in the dark region.</p>
<p>Thus the quasi-silhouette we&#8217;ll see in the images is not the outline of the black hole&#8217;s edge, but an effect of the light bending, and is in fact considerably larger than the black hole.  <strong>In truth</strong> it may be as much as 50% larger in radius than the event horizon, and the silhouette as seen in the image <strong>may appear </strong> more than 2.5 to 5 times larger (depending on how fast the black hole rotates) than the true event horizon &#8212; all due to the bent paths of the radio waves. <em>Note Added: THIS ASSUMES THAT THE QUASI-SILHOUETTE IS NOT SUBSTANTIALLY FILLED IN, WHICH, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/06/14/a-ring-of-controversy-around-a-black-hole-photo">IT TURNS OUT</a>, MAY NOT BE TRUE.</em></p>
<p><em>Interestingly, it turns out that the details of how the black hole is rotating don&#8217;t much affect the size of the quasi-silhouette. <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/06/14/a-ring-of-controversy-around-a-black-hole-photo">Note Added: THIS IS TRUE, BUT NOT ENTIRELY RELEVANT WHEN USING AN IMPERFECT CAMERA.</a>  The black hole in the Milky Way is already understood well enough that astronomers know how big its quasi-silhouette ought to appear, even though we don&#8217;t know its rotation speed and axis.  <strong>The quasi-silhouette&#8217;s size in the image will therefore be an important test of Einstein&#8217;s formulas for gravity, even on day one.</strong>  If the size disagrees with expectations, expect a lot of hullabaloo.</em></p>
<p><strong>What is the event horizon, and is it present in the image?</strong></p>
<p>The event horizon of a black hole, in Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity, is not an object. It&#8217;s the edge of a region of no-return, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/black-holes/black-hole-information-paradox-an-introduction/">as I&#8217;ve explained here</a>. Anything that goes past that point can&#8217;t re-emerge, and nothing that happens inside can ever send any light or messages back out.</p>
<p>Despite what some writers are saying, we&#8217;re not expecting to see the event horizon in the images. As is hopefully clear by now, what astronomers are observing is (a) the radio waves from the gas near the black hole, after the waves have taken strongly curved paths, and (b) a quasi-silhouette of the black hole from which radio waves don&#8217;t emerge. But as I explained above, <em><strong>this quasi-silhouette is considerably larger than the event horizon, </strong></em>both in truth and in appearance. The event horizon does not emit any light, and it sits well inside the quasi-silhouette, not at its edge.</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">Still, <em><strong>what we&#8217;ll be seeing is closer to the event horizon than anything we&#8217;ve ever seen before</strong></em>, which is really exciting!   And if the silhouette has an unexpected appearance, we just might get our first hint of a breakdown of Einstein&#8217;s understanding of event horizons.  Don&#8217;t bet on it, but you can hope for it.</span></p>
<p><strong>Can we hope to see the singularity of a black hole?</strong></p>
<p>No, for two reasons.</p>
<p>First, <strong><em>there probably is no singularity in the first place</em></strong>. It drives me nuts when people say there&#8217;s a singularity inside a black hole; that&#8217;s just wrong. The correct statement is that in Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity, singularities (i.e. unavoidable infinities) arise <em><strong>in the math</strong></em> &#8212; in the <em><strong>formulas</strong></em> for black holes (or more precisely, in the solutions to those formulas that describe black holes.) But <em><strong>a singularity in the math</strong></em> <em><strong>does not mean that there&#8217;s a singularity in nature!  </strong></em>It usually means that the math isn&#8217;t quite right &#8212; not that anyone made a mistake, but that the formulas that we&#8217;re using aren&#8217;t appropriate, and need to be modified in some way, because of some natural phenomenon that we don&#8217;t yet understand.</p>
<p>A singularity in a formula implies a <strong>mystery</strong> in nature &#8212; <em><strong>not</strong></em> <strong>a singularity</strong> in nature.</p>
<p>In fact, historically, in every previous case where singularities have appeared in formulas, it simply meant that the formula (or solution) was not accurate in that context, or wasn&#8217;t being used correctly. We already know that Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity can&#8217;t be complete (it doesn&#8217;t accommodate quantum physics, which is also a part of the real world) and it would be no surprise if its incompleteness is responsible for these infinities. The math singularity merely signifies that the physics very deep inside a black hole isn&#8217;t understood yet.</p>
<p><em>[The same issue afflicts the statement that <strong>the Big Bang began with a singularity</strong>; the solution to the equations has a singularity, yes, but that&#8217;s very far from saying that nature&#8217;s Big Bang actually began with one.]</em></p>
<p>Ok, so how about revising the question: is there any hope of seeing the region deep inside the black hole where Einstein&#8217;s equations have a singularity? No. Remember what&#8217;s being observed is the stuff outside the black hole, and the black hole&#8217;s quasi-silhouette. What happens inside a black hole stays inside a black hole. Anything else is inference.</p>
<p><em>[More precisely, what happens inside a huge black hole stays inside a black hole for eons.  For tiny black holes it comes out sooner, but even so it is hopelessly scrambled in the form of `Hawking radiation.&#8217;]</em></p>
<p><strong>Any other questions?</strong></p>
<p>Maybe there are some questions that are bothering readers that I haven&#8217;t addressed here?  I&#8217;m super-busy this afternoon and all day Wednesday with non-physics things, but maybe if you ask the question early enough I can get address it here before the press conference (at 9 am Wednesday, New York City time).   Also, if you find my answers confusing, please comment; I can try to further clarify them for later readers.</p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;"><strong>It&#8217;s a historic moment, or at least the first stage in a historic process.  To me, as I hope to all of you, it&#8217;s all very exciting and astonishing how the surreal weirdness of Einstein&#8217;s understanding of gravity, and the creepy mysteries of black holes, have suddenly, in just a few quick years, become undeniably real!</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There has long been a question as to what types of events and processes are responsible for the highest-energy neutrinos coming from space and observed by scientists.  Another question, probably related, is what creates the majority of high-energy <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/04/03/ams-presents-some-first-results/">cosmic rays</a> &#8212; the particles, mostly <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/">protons</a>, that are constantly raining down upon the Earth.</p>
<p>As scientists&#8217; ability to detect high-energy neutrinos <em>(particles that are hugely abundant, electrically neutral, very light-weight, and <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/how-one-detects-neutrinos/">very difficult to observe</a>)</em> and high-energy photons <em>(particles of light, though not necessarily of visible light) </em>have become more powerful and precise, there&#8217;s been considerable hope of getting an answer to these question.  One of the things we&#8217;ve been awaiting (<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/05/09/neutrinos-from-that-recent-gamma-ray-burst/">and been disappointed</a> a couple of times) is a violent explosion out in the universe that produces both high-energy photons and neutrinos at the same time, at a high enough rate that both types of particles can be observed at the same time coming from the same direction.</p>
<p>In recent years, there has been some indirect evidence that blazars &#8212; narrow jets of particles, pointed in our general direction like the barrel of a gun, and created as material swirls near and almost into giant black holes in the centers of very distant galaxies &#8212; may be responsible for the high-energy neutrinos.  Strong direct evidence in favor of this hypothesis has just been presented today.   Last year, one of these blazars flared brightly, and the flare created both high-energy neutrinos and high-energy photons that were observed within the same period, coming from the same place in the sky.</p>
<p><a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/how-one-detects-neutrinos/icecube-a-giant-frozen-neutrino-catcher/">I have written about the IceCube neutrino observatory before</a>; it&#8217;s a cubic kilometer of ice under the South Pole, instrumented with light detectors, and it&#8217;s ideal for observing neutrinos whose motion-energy far exceeds that of the protons in the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">Large Hadron Collider</a>, where the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/why-the-higgs-particle-matters/">Higgs particle</a> was discovered.  These neutrinos mostly pass through Ice Cube undetected, but one in 100,000 hits something, and debris from the collision produces visible light that Ice Cube&#8217;s detectors can record.   IceCube has already made important discoveries, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/05/16/possible-important-discovery-at-icecube/">detecting a new class of high-energy neutrinos</a>.</p>
<p>On Sept 22 of last year, one of these very high-energy neutrinos was observed at IceCube. More precisely, a muon created underground by the collision of this neutrino with an atomic nucleus <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/how-one-detects-neutrinos/icecube-a-giant-frozen-neutrino-catcher/">was observed in</a> IceCube.  To create the observed muon, the neutrino must have had a motion-energy tens of thousand times larger than than the motion-energy of each proton at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).  And the direction of the neutrino&#8217;s motion is known too; it&#8217;s essentially the same as that of the observed muon.  So IceCube&#8217;s scientists knew where, on the sky, this neutrino had come from.</p>
<p><em>(This doesn&#8217;t work for typical cosmic rays; protons, for instance, travel in curved paths because they are deflected by cosmic magnetic fields, so even if you measure their travel direction at their arrival to Earth, you don&#8217;t then know where they came from. Neutrinos, beng electrically neutral, aren&#8217;t affected by magnetic fields and travel in a straight line, just as photons do.)</em></p>
<p>Very close to that direction is a well-known blazar (TXS-0506), four billion light years away (a good fraction of the distance across the visible universe).</p>
<p>The IceCube scientists immediately reported their neutrino observation to scientists with high-energy photon detectors.  (I&#8217;ve also written about some of the detectors used to study the very high-energy photons that we find in the sky: in particular, the <a href="http://www-glast.stanford.edu/">Fermi/LAT satellite</a> played a role in this latest discovery.) Fermi/LAT, which continuously monitors the sky, was already detecting high-energy photons coming from the same direction.   Within a few days the Fermi scientists had confirmed that TXS-0506 was indeed flaring at the time &#8212; already starting in April 2017 in fact, six times as bright as normal.  With this news from IceCube and Fermi/LAT, many other telescopes (including the <a href="https://wwwmagic.mpp.mpg.de/">MAGIC cosmic ray detector telescopes</a> among others) then followed suit and studied the blazar, learning more about the properties of its flare.</p>
<p>Now, just a single neutrino on its own isn&#8217;t entirely convincing; is it possible that this was all just a coincidence?  So the IceCube folks went back to their older data to snoop around.  There they discovered, in their 2014-2015 data, a dramatic flare <strong><em>in neutrinos</em></strong> &#8212; more than a dozen neutrinos, seen over 150 days, had come from the same direction in the sky where TXS-0506 is sitting.  (More precisely, nearly 20 from this direction were seen, in a time period where normally there&#8217;d just be 6 or 7 by random chance.)  This confirms that this blazar is indeed a source of neutrinos.  And from the energies of the neutrinos in this flare, yet more can be learned about this blazar, and how it makes  high-energy photons and neutrinos at the same time.  Interestingly, so far at least, there&#8217;s no strong evidence for this 2014 flare in photons, except perhaps an increase in the number of the highest-energy photons&#8230; but not in the total brightness of the source.</p>
<p>The full picture, still emerging, tends to support the idea that the blazar arises from a supermassive black hole, acting as a natural particle accelerator, making a narrow spray of particles, <em><strong>including protons</strong></em>, at extremely high energy.  These protons, millions of times more energetic than those at the Large Hadron Collider, then collide with more ordinary particles that are just wandering around, such as visible-light photons from starlight or infrared photons from the ambient heat of the universe.  The collisions <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/09/23/how-to-make-a-neutrino-beam/">produce particles called pions, made from quarks and anti-quarks and gluons (just as protons are), which in turn decay either to photons or to (among other things) neutrinos</a>.  And its those resulting photons and neutrinos which have now been jointly observed.</p>
<p>Since cosmic rays, the mysterious high energy particles from outer space that are constantly raining down on our planet, are mostly protons, <em><strong>this is evidence that many, perhaps most, of the highest energy cosmic rays are created in the natural particle accelerators associated with blazars.</strong></em> Many scientists have suspected that the most extreme cosmic rays are associated with the most active black holes at the centers of galaxies, and now we have evidence and more details in favor of this idea.  It now appears likely that that this question will be answerable over time, as more blazar flares are observed and studied.</p>
<p>The announcement of this important discovery was made at the National Science Foundation by Francis Halzen, the IceCube principal investigator, Olga Botner, former IceCube spokesperson, Regina Caputo, the Fermi-LAT analysis coordinator, and Razmik Mirzoyan, MAGIC spokesperson.</p>
<p>The fact that both photons and neutrinos have been observed from the same source is an example of what people are now calling &#8220;multi-messenger astronomy&#8221;; a previous example was<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2017/10/17/the-significance-of-yesterdays-gravitational-wave-announcement-an-faq/"> the observation in gravitational waves, and in photons of many different energies, of two merging neutron stars</a>.  Of course, something like this already happened in <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/09/20/supernovas-and-neutrinos/">1987, when a supernova was seen by eye, and also observed in neutrinos</a>.  But in this case, the neutrinos and photons have energies millions and billions of times larger!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2017/10/16/a-scientific-breakthrough-combining-gravitational-and-electromagnetic-waves/">Yesterday&#8217;s post</a> on the results from the LIGO/VIRGO network of gravitational wave detectors was aimed at getting information out, rather than providing the pedagogical backdrop.  Today I&#8217;m following up with a post that attempts to answer some of the questions that my readers and my personal friends asked me.  Some wanted to understand better how to visualize what had happened, while others wanted more clarity on why the discovery was so important.  So I&#8217;ve put together a post which  (1) explains what neutron stars and black holes are and what their mergers are like, (2) clarifies why yesterday&#8217;s announcement was important &#8212; and there were many reasons, which is why it&#8217;s hard to reduce it all to a single soundbite.  And (3) there are some miscellaneous questions at the end.</p>
<p>First, a disclaimer: I am *not* an expert in the very complex subject of neutron star mergers and the resulting explosions, called kilonovas.  These are much more complicated than black hole mergers.  I am still learning some of the details.  Hopefully I&#8217;ve avoided errors, but you&#8217;ll notice a few places where I don&#8217;t know the answers &#8230; yet.  Perhaps my more expert colleagues will help me fill in the gaps over time.</p>
<p>Please, if you spot any errors, don&#8217;t hesitate to comment!!  And feel free to ask additional questions whose answers I can add to the list.</p>
<p><strong>BASIC QUESTIONS ABOUT NEUTRON STARS, BLACK HOLES, AND MERGERS</strong></p>
<p><strong>What are neutron stars and black holes, and how are they related?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/">Every atom is made from a tiny atomic nucleus, made of neutrons and protons (which are very similar), and loosely surrounded by electrons.</a> Most of an atom is empty space, so it can, under extreme circumstances, be crushed &#8212; but only if every electron and proton convert to a neutron (which remains behind) and a neutrino (which heads off into outer space.) When a giant star runs out of fuel, the pressure from its furnace turns off, and it collapses inward under its own weight, creating just those extraordinary conditions in which the matter can be crushed. Thus: a star&#8217;s interior, with a mass one to several times the Sun&#8217;s mass, is all turned into a several-mile(kilometer)-wide ball of neutrons &#8212; the number of neutrons approaching a 1 with 57 zeroes after it.</p>
<p>If the star is big but not too big, the neutron ball stiffens and holds its shape, and the star explodes outward, blowing itself to pieces in a what is called a core-collapse supernova. The ball of neutrons remains behind; this is what we call a neutron star. It&#8217;s a ball of the densest material that we know can exist in the universe &#8212; a pure atomic nucleus many miles(kilometers) across. It has a very hard surface; if you tried to go inside a neutron star, your experience would be a lot worse than running into a closed door at a hundred miles per hour.</p>
<p>If the star is very big indeed, the neutron ball that forms may immediately (or soon) collapse under its own weight, forming a black hole. A supernova may or may not result in this case; the star might just disappear. A black hole is very, very different from a neutron star. Black holes are what&#8217;s left when matter collapses irretrievably upon itself under the pull of gravity, shrinking down endlessly. While a neutron star has a surface that you could smash your head on, a black hole has no surface &#8212; it has an edge that is simply a point of no return, called a horizon. In Einstein&#8217;s theory, you can just go right through, as if passing through an open door. You won&#8217;t even notice the moment you go in. <em>[Note: this is true in Einstein&#8217;s theory. But there is a big controversy as to whether the combination of Einstein&#8217;s theory with quantum physics changes the horizon into something novel and dangerous to those who enter; this is known as the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/black-holes/black-hole-information-paradox-an-introduction/">firewall controversy</a>, and would take us too far afield into speculation.] </em> But once you pass through that door, you can never return.</p>
<p>Black holes can form in other ways too, but not those that we&#8217;re observing with the LIGO/VIRGO detectors.</p>
<p><strong>Why are their mergers the best sources for gravitational waves?</strong></p>
<p>One of the easiest and most obvious ways to make gravitational waves is to have two objects orbiting each other.  If you put your two fists in a pool of water and move them around each other, you&#8217;ll get a pattern of water waves spiraling outward; this is in rough (<em>very</em> rough!) analogy to what happens with two orbiting objects, although, since the objects are moving in space, the waves aren&#8217;t in a material like water.  They are waves in space itself.</p>
<p>To get powerful gravitational waves, you want objects each with a very big mass that are orbiting around each other at very high speed. To get the fast motion, you need the force of gravity between the two objects to be strong; and to get gravity to be as strong as possible, you need the two objects to be as close as possible (since, as Isaac Newton already knew, gravity between two objects grows stronger when the distance between them shrinks.) But if the objects are large, they can&#8217;t get too close; they will bump into each other and merge long before their orbit can become fast enough. So to get a really fast orbit, you need <strong>two relatively small objects, each with a relatively big mass</strong> &#8212; what scientists refer to as <strong>compact objects</strong>. Neutron stars and black holes are the most compact objects we know about. Fortunately, they do indeed often travel in orbiting pairs, and do sometimes, for a very brief period before they merge, orbit rapidly enough to produce gravitational waves that LIGO and VIRGO can observe.</p>
<p><strong>Why do we find these objects in pairs in the first place?</strong></p>
<p>Stars very often travel in pairs&#8230; they are called binary stars. They can start their lives in pairs, forming together in large gas clouds, or even if they begin solitary, they can end up pairing up if they live in large densely packed communities of stars where it is common for multiple stars to pass nearby. Perhaps surprisingly, their pairing can survive the collapse and explosion of either star, leaving two black holes, two neutron stars, or one of each in orbit around one another.</p>
<p><strong>What happens when these objects merge?</strong></p>
<p>Not surprisingly, there are three classes of mergers which can be detected: two black holes merging, two neutron stars merging, and a neutron star merging with a black hole. The first class was observed in 2015 (and <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2016/02/11/advance-thoughts-on-ligo/">announced in 2016</a>), the second was announced <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2017/10/16/a-scientific-breakthrough-combining-gravitational-and-electromagnetic-waves/">yesterday</a>, and it&#8217;s a matter of time before the third class is observed. The two objects may orbit each other for billions of years, very slowly radiating gravitational waves (an effect <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/04/30/did-bicep2-detect-gravitational-waves-directly-or-indirectly/">observed in the 70&#8217;s, leading to a Nobel Prize</a>) and gradually coming closer and closer together. Only in the last day of their lives do their orbits really start to speed up. And just before these objects merge, they begin to orbit each other once per second, then ten times per second, then a hundred times per second. Visualize that if you can: objects a few dozen miles (kilometers) across, a few miles (kilometers) apart, each with the mass of the Sun or greater, orbiting each other <em><span style="color:#ff0000;">100 times each second</span></em>. It&#8217;s truly mind-boggling &#8212; a spinning dumbbell beyond the imagination of even the greatest minds of the 19th century. I don&#8217;t know any scientist who isn&#8217;t awed by this vision. It all sounds like science fiction. But it&#8217;s not.</p>
<p><strong>How do we know this isn&#8217;t science fiction?</strong></p>
<p>We know, if we believe Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity (and I&#8217;ll give you a very good reason to believe in it in just a moment.) Einstein&#8217;s theory predicts that such a rapidly spinning, large-mass dumbbell formed by two orbiting compact objects will produce a telltale pattern of ripples in space itself &#8212; gravitational waves. That pattern is both complicated and precisely predicted. In the case of black holes, the predictions go right up to and past the moment of merger, to the ringing of the larger black hole that forms in the merger. In the case of neutron stars, the instants just before, during and after the merger are more complex and we can&#8217;t yet be confident we understand them, but during tens of seconds before the merger Einstein&#8217;s theory is very precise about what to expect. The theory further predicts how those ripples will cross the vast distances from where they were created to the location of the Earth, and how they will appear in the LIGO/VIRGO network of three gravitational wave detectors. The prediction of what to expect at LIGO/VIRGO thus involves not just one prediction but many: the theory is used to predict the existence and properties of black holes and of neutron stars, the detailed features of their mergers, the precise patterns of the resulting gravitational waves, and how those gravitational waves cross space. That LIGO/VIRGO have detected the telltale patterns of these gravitational waves. That these wave patterns agree with Einstein&#8217;s theory in every detail is the strongest evidence ever obtained that there is nothing wrong with Einstein&#8217;s theory when used in these combined contexts.  That then in turn gives us confidence that our interpretation of the LIGO/VIRGO results is correct, confirming that black holes and neutron stars really exist and really merge. <em>(Notice the reasoning is slightly circular&#8230; but that&#8217;s how scientific knowledge proceeds, as a set of detailed consistency checks that gradually and eventually become so tightly interconnected as to be almost impossible to unwind.  Scientific reasoning is not deductive; it is inductive.  We do it not because it is logically ironclad but because it works so incredibly well &#8212; as witnessed by the computer, and its screen, that I&#8217;m using to write this, and the wired and wireless internet and computer disk that will be used to transmit and store it.)</em></p>
<p><strong>THE SIGNIFICANCE(S) OF YESTERDAY&#8217;S ANNOUNCEMENT OF A NEUTRON STAR MERGER</strong></p>
<p>What makes it difficult to explain the significance of yesterday&#8217;s announcement is that it consists of many important results piled up together, rather than a simple takeaway that can be reduced to a single soundbite. (That was also true of the black hole mergers announcement back in 2016, which is why I wrote <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2016/02/11/advance-thoughts-on-ligo/">a long post about it.</a>)</p>
<p>So here is a list of important things we learned.  No one of them, by itself, is earth-shattering, but each one is profound, and taken together they form a major event in scientific history.</p>
<p><strong>First confirmed observation of a merger of two neutron stars</strong>: We&#8217;ve known these mergers must occur, but there&#8217;s nothing like being sure. And since these things are too far away and too small to see in a telescope, <em>the only way to be sure these mergers occur, and to learn more details about them, is with gravitational waves</em>.  We expect to see many more of these mergers in coming years as gravitational wave astronomy increases in its sensitivity, and we will learn more and more about them.</p>
<p><strong>New information about the properties of neutron stars:</strong> Neutron stars were proposed almost a hundred years ago and were confirmed to exist in the 60&#8217;s and 70&#8217;s.  But their precise details aren&#8217;t known; we believe they are like a giant atomic nucleus, but they&#8217;re so vastly larger than ordinary atomic nuclei that can&#8217;t be sure we understand all of their internal properties, and there are debates in the scientific community that can&#8217;t be easily answered&#8230; until, perhaps, now.</p>
<p>From the detailed pattern of the gravitational waves of this one neutron star merger, scientists already learn two things. First, we confirm that Einstein&#8217;s theory correctly predicts the basic pattern of gravitational waves from orbiting neutron stars, as it does for orbiting and merging black holes. Unlike black holes, however, there are more questions about what happens to neutron stars when they merge. The question of what happened to this pair after they merged is still out &#8212; did the form a neutron star, an unstable neutron star that, slowing its spin, eventually collapsed into a black hole, or a black hole straightaway?</p>
<p>But something important was already learned about the internal properties of neutron stars. The stresses of being whipped around at such incredible speeds would tear you and I apart, and would even tear the Earth apart. We know neutron stars are much tougher than ordinary rock, but how much more? If they were too flimsy, they&#8217;d have broken apart at some point during LIGO/VIRGO&#8217;s observations, and the simple pattern of gravitational waves that was expected would have suddenly become much more complicated. That didn&#8217;t happen until perhaps just before the merger.   So scientists can use the simplicity of the pattern of gravitational waves to infer some new things about how stiff and strong neutron stars are.  More mergers will improve our understanding.  Again, <em>there is no other simple way to obtain this information.</em></p>
<p><strong>First visual observation of an event that produces both immense gravitational waves and bright electromagnetic waves:</strong> Black hole mergers aren&#8217;t expected to create a brilliant light display, because, as I mentioned above, they&#8217;re more like open doors to an invisible playground than they are like rocks, so they merge rather quietly, without a big bright and hot smash-up.  But neutron stars are big balls of stuff, and so the smash-up can indeed create lots of heat and light of all sorts, just as you might naively expect.  By &#8220;light&#8221; I mean not just visible light but all forms of electromagnetic waves, at all wavelengths (and therefore at all frequencies.)  Scientists divide up the range of electromagnetic waves into categories. These categories are radio waves, microwaves, infrared light, visible light, ultraviolet light, X-rays, and gamma rays, listed from lowest frequency and largest wavelength to highest frequency and smallest wavelength.  (Note that these categories and the dividing lines between them are completely arbitrary, but the divisions are useful for various scientific purposes.  The <strong>only</strong> fundamental difference between yellow light, a radio wave, and a gamma ray is the wavelength and frequency; otherwise they&#8217;re exactly the same type of thing, a wave in the electric and magnetic fields.)</p>
<p>So if and when two neutron stars merge, we expect both gravitational waves and electromagnetic waves, the latter of many different frequencies created by many different effects that can arise when two huge balls of neutrons collide.  But just because we expect them doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re easy to see.  These mergers are pretty rare &#8212; perhaps one every hundred thousand years in each big galaxy like our own &#8212; so the ones we find using LIGO/VIRGO will generally be very far away.  If the light show is too dim, none of our telescopes will be able to see it.</p>
<p>But this light show was plenty bright.  Gamma ray detectors out in space detected it instantly, confirming that the gravitational waves from the two neutron stars led to a collision and merger that produced very high frequency light.  Already, that&#8217;s a first.  It&#8217;s as though one had seen lightning for years but never heard thunder; or as though one had observed the waves from hurricanes for years but never observed one in the sky.  Seeing both allows us a whole new set of perspectives; one plus one is often much more than two.</p>
<p>Over time &#8212; hours and days &#8212; effects were seen in visible light, ultraviolet light, infrared light, X-rays and radio waves.  Some were seen earlier than others, which itself is a story, but each one contributes to our understanding of what these mergers are actually like.</p>
<p><strong>Confirmation of the best guess concerning the origin of &#8220;short&#8221; gamma ray bursts</strong>:  For many years, bursts of gamma rays have been observed in the sky.  Among them, there seems to be a class of bursts that are shorter than most, typically lasting just a couple of seconds.  They come from all across the sky, indicating that they come from distant intergalactic space, presumably from distant galaxies.  Among other explanations, the most popular hypothesis concerning these short gamma-ray bursts has been that they come from merging neutron stars.  <em>The only way to confirm this hypothesis is with the observation of the gravitational waves from such a merger. </em> That test has now been passed; it appears that the hypothesis is correct.  That in turn means that we have, for the first time, both a good explanation of these short gamma ray bursts and, because we know how often we observe these bursts, a good estimate as to how often neutron stars merge in the universe.</p>
<p><strong>First distance measurement to a source using both a gravitational wave measure and a redshift in electromagnetic waves, allowing a new calibration of the distance scale of the universe and of its expansion rate:  </strong>The pattern over time of the gravitational waves from a merger of two black holes or neutron stars is complex enough to reveal many things about the merging objects, including a rough estimate of their masses and the orientation of the spinning pair relative to the Earth.  The overall strength of the waves, combined with the knowledge of the masses, reveals how far the pair is from the Earth.  That by itself is nice, but the real win comes when the discovery of the object using visible light, or in fact any light with frequency below gamma-rays, can be made.  In this case, the galaxy that contains the neutron stars can be determined.</p>
<p>Once we know the host galaxy, we can do something really important.  We can, by looking at the starlight, determine how rapidly the galaxy is moving away from us.  For distant galaxies, the speed at which the galaxy recedes should be related to its distance because the universe is expanding.</p>
<p>How rapidly the universe is expanding has been recently measured with remarkable precision, but the problem is that there are two different methods for making the measurement, <strong>and they disagree</strong>.   This disagreement is one of the most important problems for our understanding of the universe.  Maybe one of the measurement methods is flawed, or maybe &#8212; and this would be much more interesting &#8212; the universe simply doesn&#8217;t behave the way we think it does.</p>
<p>What gravitational waves do is give us a third method: the gravitational waves directly provide the distance to the galaxy, and the electromagnetic waves directly provide the speed of recession.  <em>There is no other way to make this type of joint measurement directly for distant galaxies.  </em>The method is not accurate enough to be useful in just one merger, but once dozens of mergers have been observed, the average result will provide important new information about the universe&#8217;s expansion.  When combined with the other methods, it may help resolve this all-important puzzle.</p>
<p><strong>Best test so far of Einstein&#8217;s prediction that the speed of light and the speed of gravitational waves are identical</strong>: Since gamma rays from the merger and the peak of the gravitational waves arrived within two seconds of one another after traveling 130 million years &#8212; that is, about 5 thousand million million seconds &#8212; we can say that the speed of light and the speed of gravitational waves are both equal to the cosmic speed limit to within one part in 2 thousand million million.  <em>Such a precise test requires the combination of gravitational wave and gamma ray observations.</em></p>
<p><strong>Efficient production of heavy elements confirmed</strong>:  It&#8217;s long been said that we are star-stuff, or stardust, and it&#8217;s been clear for a long time that it&#8217;s true.  But there&#8217;s been a puzzle when one looks into the details.  While it&#8217;s known that all the chemical elements from hydrogen up to iron are formed inside of stars, and can be blasted into space in supernova explosions to drift around and eventually form planets, moons, and humans, it hasn&#8217;t been quite as clear how the other elements with heavier atoms &#8212; atoms such as iodine, cesium, gold, lead, bismuth, uranium and so on &#8212; predominantly formed.  Yes they can be formed in supernovas, but not so easily; and there seem to be more atoms of heavy elements around the universe than supernovas can explain.  There are many supernovas in the history of the universe, but the efficiency for producing heavy chemical elements is just too low.</p>
<p>It was proposed some time ago that the mergers of neutron stars might be a suitable place to produce these heavy elements.  Even those these mergers are rare, they might be much more efficient, because the nuclei of heavy elements contain lots of neutrons and, not surprisingly, a collision of two neutron stars would produce lots of neutrons in its debris, suitable perhaps for making these nuclei.   A key indication that this is going on would be the following: if a neutron star merger could be identified using gravitational waves, and if its location could be determined using telescopes, then one would observe a pattern of light that would be characteristic of what is now called a &#8220;kilonova&#8221; explosion.   <em>Warning: I don&#8217;t yet know much about kilonovas and I may be leaving out important details.</em> A kilonova is powered by the process of forming heavy elements; most of the nuclei produced are initially radioactive &#8212; i.e., unstable &#8212; and they break down by emitting high energy particles, including the particles of light (called photons) which are in the gamma ray and X-ray categories.  The resulting characteristic glow would be expected to have a pattern of a certain type: it would be initially bright but would dim rapidly in visible light, with a long afterglow in infrared light.  The reasons for this are complex, so let me set them aside for now.  The important point is that this pattern was observed, confirming that a kilonova of this type occurred, and thus that, in this neutron star merger, enormous amounts of heavy elements were indeed produced.  So we now have a lot of evidence, for the first time, that almost all the heavy chemical elements on and around our planet were formed in neutron star mergers.  Again, <em>we could not know this if we did not know that this was a neutron star merger, and that information comes only from the gravitational wave observation.</em></p>
<p><strong>MISCELLANEOUS QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Did the merger of these two neutron stars result in a new black hole, a larger neutron star, or an unstable rapidly spinning neutron star that later collapsed into a black hole?</strong></p>
<p>We don&#8217;t yet know, and maybe we won&#8217;t know.  Some scientists involved appear to be leaning toward the possibility that a black hole was formed, but others seem to say the jury is out.  I&#8217;m not sure what additional information can be obtained over time about this.</p>
<p><strong>If the two neutron stars formed a black hole, why was there a kilonova?  Why wasn&#8217;t everything sucked into the black hole?</strong></p>
<p>Black holes aren&#8217;t vacuum cleaners; they pull things in via gravity just the same way that the Earth and Sun do, and don&#8217;t suck things in some unusual way.  The only crucial thing about a black hole is that once you go in you can&#8217;t come out.  But just as when trying to avoid hitting the Earth or Sun, you can avoid falling in if you orbit fast enough or if you&#8217;re flung outward before you reach the edge.</p>
<p>The point in a neutron star merger is that the forces at the moment of merger are so intense that one or both neutron stars are partially ripped apart.  The material that is thrown outward in all directions, at an immense speed, somehow creates the bright, hot flash of gamma rays and eventually the kilonova glow from the newly formed atomic nuclei.  Those details I don&#8217;t yet understand, but I know they have been carefully studied both with approximate equations and in computer simulations such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKEnayUC_ns">this one</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfNdr9sjlU8">this one</a>.  However, <em>the accuracy of the simulations can only be confirmed through the detailed studies of a merger, such as the one just announced.</em>  It seems, from the data we&#8217;ve seen, that the simulations did a fairly good job.  I&#8217;m sure they will be improved once they are compared with the recent data.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gravitational waves are now the most important new tool in the astronomer&#8217;s toolbox.  Already they&#8217;ve been used to confirm that large black holes &#8212; with masses ten or more times that of the Sun &#8212; and mergers of these large black holes to form even larger ones, are not uncommon in the universe.   Today it goes a big step further.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s long been known that neutron stars, remnants of collapsed stars that have exploded as supernovas, are common in the universe.  And it&#8217;s been known almost as long that sometimes neutron stars travel in pairs.  (<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2016/02/11/advance-thoughts-on-ligo/">In fact that&#8217;s how gravitational waves were first discovered, indirectly, back in the 1970s.</a>)  Stars often form in pairs, and sometimes both stars explode as supernovas, leaving their neutron star relics in orbit around one another.  Neutron stars are small &#8212; just ten or so kilometers (miles) across.  According to Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity, a pair of stars should gradually lose energy by emitting gravitational waves into space, and slowly but surely the two objects should spiral in on one another.   Eventually, after many millions or even billions of years, they collide and merge into a larger neutron star, or into a black hole.  This collision does two things.</p>
<ol>
<li>It makes some kind of brilliant flash of light &#8212; electromagnetic waves &#8212; whose details are only guessed at.  Some of those electromagnetic waves will be in the form of visible light, while much of it will be in invisible forms, such as gamma rays.</li>
<li>It makes gravitational waves, whose details are easier to calculate and which are therefore distinctive, but couldn&#8217;t have been detected until LIGO and VIRGO started taking data, LIGO over the last couple of years, VIRGO over the last couple of months.</li>
</ol>
<p>It&#8217;s possible that we&#8217;ve seen the light from neutron star mergers before, but no one could be sure.  Wouldn&#8217;t it be great, then, if we could see gravitational waves AND electromagnetic waves from a neutron star merger?  It would be a little like seeing the flash and hearing the sound from fireworks &#8212; seeing and hearing is better than either one separately, with each one clarifying the other.  <em>(Caution: scientists are often speaking as if detecting gravitational waves is like &#8220;hearing&#8221;.  This is only an analogy, and a vague one!  It&#8217;s not at all the same as acoustic waves that we can hear with our ears, for many reasons&#8230; so please don&#8217;t take it too literally.) </em> If we could do both, we could learn about neutron stars and their properties in an entirely new way.</p>
<p>Today, we learned that this has happened.  LIGO , with the world&#8217;s first two gravitational observatories, detected the waves from two merging neutron stars, 130 million light years from Earth, on August 17th.  (Neutron star mergers last much longer than black hole mergers, so the two are easy to distinguish; and this one was so close, relatively speaking, that it was seen for a long while.)  VIRGO, with the third detector, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2017/09/27/ligo-and-virgo-announce-a-joint-observation-of-a-black-hole-merger/">allows scientists to triangulate and determine roughly where mergers have occurred</a>.  They saw only a very weak signal, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2017/09/27/ligo-and-virgo-announce-a-joint-observation-of-a-black-hole-merger/">but that was extremely important, because it told the scientists<em> that the merger must have occurred in a small region of the sky where VIRGO has a relative blind spot</em>.</a>  That told scientists where to look.</p>
<p>The merger was detected for more than a full minute&#8230; to be compared with black holes whose mergers can be detected for less than a second.  It&#8217;s not exactly clear yet what happened at the end, however!  Did the merged neutron stars form a black hole or a neutron star?  The jury is out.</p>
<p>At almost exactly the moment at which the gravitational waves reached their peak, a blast of gamma rays &#8212; electromagnetic waves of very high frequencies &#8212; were detected by a different scientific team, the one from FERMI. FERMI detects gamma rays from the distant universe every day, and a two-second gamma-ray-burst is not unusual.  And INTEGRAL, another gamma ray experiment, also detected it.   The teams communicated within minutes.   The FERMI and INTEGRAL gamma ray detectors can only indicate the rough region of the sky from which their gamma rays originate, and LIGO/VIRGO together also only give a rough region.  But the scientists saw those regions overlapped.  The evidence was clear.  And with that, astronomy entered a new, highly anticipated phase.</p>
<p>Already this was a huge discovery.  Brief gamma-ray bursts have been a mystery for years.  One of the best guesses as to their origin has been neutron star mergers.  Now the mystery is solved; that guess is apparently correct. <em>(Or is it?  Probably, but the gamma ray discovery is surprisingly dim, given how close it is.  So there are still questions to ask.)</em></p>
<p>Also confirmed by the fact that these signals arrived within a couple of seconds of one another, after traveling for over 100 million years from the same source, is that, indeed, the speed of light and the speed of gravitational waves are exactly the same &#8212; both of them equal to the cosmic speed limit, just as Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity predicts.</p>
<p>Next, these teams quickly told their astronomer friends to train their telescopes in the general area of the source. Dozens of telescopes, from every continent and from space, and looking for electromagnetic waves at a huge range of frequencies, pointed in that rough direction and scanned for anything unusual.  <em>(A big challenge: the object was near the Sun in the sky, so it could be viewed in darkness only for an hour each night!)</em> Light was detected!  At all frequencies!  The object was very bright, making it easy to find the galaxy in which the merger took place.  The brilliant glow was seen in gamma rays, ultraviolet light, infrared light, X-rays, and radio.  (Neutrinos, particles that can serve as another way to observe distant explosions, were not detected this time.)</p>
<p>And with so much information, so much can be learned!</p>
<p>Most important, perhaps, is this: from the pattern of the spectrum of light, the conjecture seems to be confirmed that the mergers of neutron stars are important sources, perhaps the dominant one, for many of the heavy chemical elements &#8212; iodine, iridium, cesium, gold, platinum, and so on &#8212; that are forged in the intense heat of these collisions.  It used to be thought that the same supernovas that form neutron stars in the first place were the most likely source.  But now it seems that this second stage of neutron star life &#8212; merger, rather than birth &#8212; is just as important.  That&#8217;s fascinating, because neutron star mergers are much more rare than the supernovas that form them.  There&#8217;s a supernova in our Milky Way galaxy every century or so, but it&#8217;s tens of millenia or more between these &#8220;kilonovas&#8221;, created in neutron star mergers.</p>
<p>If there&#8217;s anything disappointing about this news, it&#8217;s this: almost everything that was observed by all these different experiments was predicted in advance.  Sometimes it&#8217;s more important and useful when some of your predictions fail completely, because then you realize how much you have to learn.  Apparently our understanding of gravity, of neutron stars, and of their mergers, and of all sorts of sources of electromagnetic radiation that are produced in those merges, is even better than we might have thought. But fortunately there are a few new puzzles.  The X-rays were late; the gamma rays were dim&#8230; we&#8217;ll hear more about this shortly, as NASA is holding a second news conference.</p>
<p>Some highlights from the second news conference:</p>
<ul>
<li>New information about neutron star interiors, which affects how large they are and therefore how exactly they merge, has been obtained</li>
<li>The first ever visual-light image of a gravitational wave source, from the Swope telescope, at the outskirts of a distant galaxy; the galaxy&#8217;s center is the blob of light, and the arrow points to the explosion.</li>

<ul>
<li>The theoretical calculations for a kilonova explosion suggest that debris from the blast should rather quickly block the visual light, so the explosion dims quickly in visible light &#8212; but infrared light lasts much longer.  The observations by the visible and infrared light telescopes confirm this aspect of the theory; and you can see evidence for that in the picture above, where four days later the bright spot is both much dimmer and much redder than when it was discovered.</li>
<li>Estimate: the total mass of the gold and platinum produced in this explosion is vastly larger than the mass of the Earth.</li>
<li>Estimate: these neutron stars were formed about 10 or so billion years ago.  They&#8217;ve been orbiting each other for most of the universe&#8217;s history, and ended their lives just 130 million years ago, creating the blast we&#8217;ve so recently detected.</li>
<li>Big Puzzle: all of the previous gamma-ray bursts seen up to now have always had shone in ultraviolet light and X-rays as well as gamma rays.   But X-rays didn&#8217;t show up this time, at least not initially.  This was a big surprise.  It took 9 days for the Chandra telescope to observe X-rays, too faint for any other X-ray telescope.  Does this mean that the two neutron stars created a black hole, which then created a jet of matter that points not quite directly at us but off-axis, and shines by illuminating the matter in interstellar space?  This had been suggested as a possibility twenty years ago, but this is the first time there&#8217;s been any evidence for it.</li>
<li>One more surprise: it took 16 days for radio waves from the source to be discovered, with the Very Large Array, the most powerful existing radio telescope.  The radio emission has been growing brighter since then!  As with the X-rays, this seems also to support the idea of an off-axis jet.</li>
<li>Nothing quite like this gamma-ray burst has been seen &#8212; or rather, recognized &#8212; before.  When a gamma ray burst doesn&#8217;t have an X-ray component showing up right away, it simply looks odd and a bit mysterious.  Its harder to observe than most bursts, because without a jet pointing right at us, its afterglow fades quickly.  Moreover, a jet pointing at us is bright, so it blinds us to the more detailed and subtle features of the kilonova.  But this time, LIGO/VIRGO told scientists that &#8220;Yes, this is a neutron star merger&#8221;, leading to detailed study from all electromagnetic frequencies, including patient study over many days of the X-rays and radio.  In other cases those observations would have stopped after just a short time, and the whole story couldn&#8217;t have been properly interpreted.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome, VIRGO!  Another <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2016/02/11/advance-thoughts-on-ligo/">merger</a> of two big black holes has been detected, <a href="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/news/ligo20170927">this time by both LIGO&#8217;s two detectors and by VIRGO as well.</a></p>
<p>Aside from the fact that this means that <a href="https://www.ego-gw.it/public/about/welcome.aspx">the VIRGO instrument</a> actually works, which is great news, why is this a big deal?  By adding a third gravitational wave detector, built by the VIRGO collaboration, to LIGO&#8217;s Washington and Louisiana detectors, the scientists involved in the search for gravitational waves now can determine fairly accurately the direction from which a detected gravitational wave signal is coming.  And this allows them to do something new: to tell their astronomer colleagues roughly where to look in the sky, using ordinary telescopes, for some form of electromagnetic waves (perhaps visible light, gamma rays, or radio waves) that might have been produced by whatever created the gravitational waves.<span id="more-9757"></span></p>
<p>The point is that with three detectors, one can triangulate.  The gravitational waves travel for billions of years, traveling at the speed of light, and when they pass by, they are detected at both LIGO detectors and at VIRGO.  But because it takes light a few thousandths of a second to travel the diameter of the Earth, the waves arrive at slightly different times at the LIGO Washington site, the LIGO Louisiana site, and the VIRGO site in Italy.  The precise timing tells the scientists what direction the waves were traveling in, and therefore roughly where they came from.  In a similar way, using the fact that sound travels at a known speed, the times that a gunshot is heard at multiple locations can be used by police to determine where the shot was fired.</p>
<p>You can see the impact in the picture below, which is an image of the sky drawn as a sphere, as if seen from outside the sky looking in.  In previous detections of black hole mergers by LIGO&#8217;s two detectors, the scientists could only determine a large swath of sky where the observed merger might have occurred; those are the four colored regions that stretch far across the sky.  But notice the green splotch at lower left.  That&#8217;s the region of sky where the black hole merger announced today occurred.  The fact that this region is many times smaller than the other four reflects what including VIRGO makes possible.  It&#8217;s a small enough region that one can search using an appropriate telescope for something that is making visible light, or gamma rays, or radio waves.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While a black hole merger isn&#8217;t expected to be observable by other telescopes, and indeed nothing was observed by other telescopes this time, other events that LIGO might detect, such as a merger of two neutron stars, may create an observable effect. We can hope for such exciting news over the next year or two.</p>

<p>The top plot shows the number of X-rays (high-energy photons [particles of light]) coming from the sun, and that huge spike in the middle of the plot indicates a very powerful solar flare occurred about 24 hours ago.  It should take about 2 days from the time of the flare for its other effects &#8212; the cloud of electrically-charged particles expelled from the Sun&#8217;s atmosphere &#8212; to arrive at Earth.  The electrically-charged particles are what generate the auroras, when they are directed by Earth&#8217;s magnetic field to enter the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere near the Earth&#8217;s magnetic poles, where they crash into atoms in the upper atmosphere, exciting them and causing them to radiate visible light.</p>
<p>The flare was very powerful, but its cloud of particles didn&#8217;t head straight for Earth.  We might get only a glancing blow.  So we don&#8217;t know how big an effect to expect here on our planet.  All we can do for now is be hopeful, and wait.</p>
<p>In any case, auroras borealis and australis are possible in the next day or so.  Watch for the middle plot to go haywire, and for the bars in the lower plot to jump higher; then you know the time has arrived.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back in 1999 I saw a total solar eclipse in Europe, and it was a life-altering experience.  I wrote about it back then, but was never entirely happy with the article.  This week I&#8217;ve revised it.  It could still benefit from some editing and revision (comments welcome), but I think it&#8217;s now a good read.  It&#8217;s full of intellectual observations, but there are powerful emotions too.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested, you can <a title="eclipse" href="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/eclipse1.pdf">read it as a pdf</a>, or just scroll down.</p>

<p><strong> A Luminescent Darkness: My 1999 Eclipse Adventure</strong></p>
<p>© Matt Strassler 1999</p>
<p>After two years of dreaming, two months of planning, and two hours of packing, I drove to John F. Kennedy airport, took the shuttle to the Air France terminal, and checked in.  I was brimming with excitement. In three days time, with a bit of luck, I would witness one the great spectacles that a human being can experience: a complete, utter and total eclipse of the Sun.<span id="more-9609"></span></p>
<p>I had missed one eight years earlier. In July 1991, a total solar eclipse crossed over Baja California. I had thought seriously about driving the fourteen hundred miles from the San Francisco area, where I was a graduate student studying theoretical physics, to the very southern tip of the peninsula. But worried about my car&#8217;s ill health and scared by rumors of gasoline shortages in Baja, I chickened out. Four of my older colleagues, more worldly and more experienced, and supplied with a more reliable vehicle, drove down together. When they returned, exhilarated, they regaled us with stories of their magical adventure. Hearing their tales, I kicked myself for not going, and had been kicking myself ever since. Life is not so long that such opportunities can be rationalized or procrastinated away.</p>
<p>A total eclipse of the Sun is a event of mythic significance, so rare and extraordinary and unbelievable that it really ought to exist only in ancient legends, in epic poems, and in science fiction stories. There are other types of eclipses &#8212; partial and total eclipses of the Moon, in which the Earth blocks sunlight that normally illuminates the Moon, and various eclipses of the Sun in which the Moon blocks sunlight that normally illuminates the Earth. But total solar eclipses are in a class all their own. Only during the brief moments of totality does the Sun vanish altogether, leaving the shocked spectator in a suddenly darkened world, gazing uncomprehendingly at a black disk of nothingness.</p>
<p>Our species relies on daylight. Day is warm; day grows our food; day permits travel with a clear sense of what lies ahead. We are so fearful of the night &#8212; of what lurks there unseen, of the sounds that we cannot interpret. Horror films rely on this fear; demons and axe murderers are rarely found walking about in bright sunshine. Dark places are dangerous places; sudden unexpected darkness is worst of all. These are the conventions of cinema, born of our inmost psychology. But the Sun and the Moon are not actors projected on a screen. The terror is real.</p>
<p>It has been said that if the Earth were a member of a federation of a million planets, it would be a famous tourist attraction, because this home of ours would be the only one in the republic with such beautiful eclipses. For our skies are witness to a coincidence truly of cosmic proportions. It is a stunning accident that although the Sun is so immense that it could hold a million Earths, and the Moon so small that dozens could fit inside our planet, these two spheres, the brightest bodies in Earth&#8217;s skies, appear the same size. A faraway giant may seem no larger than a nearby child. And this perfect match of their sizes and distances makes our planet&#8217;s eclipses truly spectacular, visually and scientifically. They are described by witnesses as a sight of weird and unique beauty, a visual treasure completely unlike anything else a person will ever see, or even imagine.</p>
<p>But total solar eclipses are uncommon, occurring only once every year or two. Even worse, totality only occurs in a narrow band that sweeps across the Earth &#8212; often just across its oceans. Only a small fraction of the Earth sees a total eclipse in any century. And so these eclipses are precious; only the lucky, or the devoted, will experience one before they die.</p>
<p>In my own life, I&#8217;d certainly been more devoted than lucky. I knew it wasn&#8217;t wise to wait for the Moon&#8217;s shadow to find me by chance. Instead I was going on a journey to place myself in its path.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge in eclipse-chasing is the logistics. The area in which totality is visible is very long but very narrow. For my trip, in 1999, it was a long strip running west to east all across Europe, but only a hundred miles wide from north to south. A narrow zone crossing heavily populated areas is sure to attract a massive crowd, so finding hotels and transport can be difficult. Furthermore, although eclipses are precisely predictable, governed by the laws of gravity worked out by Isaac Newton himself, weather and human beings are far less dependable.</p>
<p>But I had a well-considered plan. I would travel by train to a small city east of Paris, where I had reserved a rental car. Keeping a close watch on the weather forecast, I would drive on back roads, avoiding clogged highways. I had no hotel reservations. It would have been pointless to make them for the night before the event, since it was well known that everything within two hours drive of the totality zone was booked solid. Moreover, I wanted the flexibility to adjust to the weather and couldn&#8217;t know in advance where I&#8217;d want to stay. So my idea was that on the night prior to the eclipse, I would drive to a good location in the path of the lunar shadow, and sleep in the back of my car. I had a sleeping bag with me to keep me warm, and enough lightweight clothing for the week &#8212; and not much else.</p>
<p>Oh, it was such a good plan, clean and simple, and that&#8217;s why my heart had so far to sink and my brain so ludicrous a calamity to contemplate when I checked my wallet, an hour before flight time, and saw a gaping black emptiness where my driver&#8217;s license was supposed to be. I was struck dumb. No license meant no car rental; no car meant no flexibility and no place to sleep. Sixteen years of driving and I had never lost it before; why, why, of all times, now, when it was to play a central role in a once-in-a-lifetime adventure?</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t panic. I walked calmly back to the check-in counters, managed to get myself rescheduled for a flight on the following day, drove the three hours back to New Jersey, and started looking. It wasn&#8217;t in my car. Nor was it in the pile of unneeded items I&#8217;d removed from my wallet. Not in my suitcase, not under my bed, not in my office. As it was Sunday, I couldn&#8217;t get a replacement license. Hope dimmed, flickered, and went dark.</p>
<p>Deep breaths. Plan B?</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t have a tent, and couldn&#8217;t easily have found one. But I did have a rain poncho, large enough to keep my sleeping bag off the ground. As long as it didn&#8217;t rain too hard, I could try, the night before the eclipse, to find a place to camp outdoors; with luck I&#8217;d find lodging for the other nights. I doubted this would be legal, but I was willing to take the chance. But what about my suitcase? I couldn&#8217;t carry that around with me into the wilderness. Fortunately, I knew a solution. For a year after college, I had studied music in France, and had often gone sightseeing by rail. On those trips I had commonly made use of the ubiquitous lockers at the train stations, leaving some luggage while I explored the nearby town. As for flexibility of location, that was unrecoverable; the big downside of Plan B was that I could no longer adjust to the weather. I&#8217;d just have to be lucky. I comforted myself with the thought that the worst that could happen to me would be a week of eating French food.</p>
<p>So the next day, carrying the additional weight of a poncho and an umbrella, but having in compensation discarded all inessential clothing and tourist information, I headed back to the airport, this time by bus. Without further misadventures, I was soon being carried across the Atlantic.</p>
<p>As usual I struggled to nap amid the loud silence of a night flight. But my sleeplessness was rewarded with one of those good omens that makes you think that you must be doing the right thing. As we approached the European coastline, and I gazed sleepily out my window, I suddenly saw a bright glowing light. It was the rising white tip of the thin crescent Moon.</p>
<p>Solar eclipses occur at New Moon, always. This is nothing but simple geometry; the Moon must place itself exactly between the Sun and the Earth to cause an eclipse, and that means the half of the Moon that faces us must be in shadow. (At Full Moon, the opposite is true; the Earth is between the Sun and the Moon, so the half of the Moon that faces us is in full sunlight. That&#8217;s when lunar eclipses can occur.) And just before a New Moon, the Moon is close to the Sun&#8217;s location in the sky. It becomes visible, as the Earth turns, just before the Sun does, rising as a morning crescent shortly before sunrise. (Similarly, we get an evening crescent just after a New Moon.)</p>
<p>There, out over the vast Atlantic, from a dark ocean of water into a dark sea of stars, rose the delicate thin slip of Luna the lover, on her way to her mystical rendezvous with Sol. Her crescent smiled at me and winked a greeting. I smiled back, and whispered, &#8220;see you in two days&#8230;&#8221; For totality is not merely the only time you can look straight at the Sun and see its crown. It is the only time you can see the New Moon.</p>
<p>We landed in Paris at 6:30 Monday morning, E-day-minus-two. I headed straight to the airport train station, and poured over rail maps and my road maps trying to guess a good location to use as a base. Eventually I chose a medium-sized town with the name Charleville-Mezieres. It was on the northern edge of the totality zone, at the end of a large spoke of the Paris-centered rail system, and was far enough from Paris, Brussels, and all large German towns that I suspected it might escape the worst of the crowds. It would then be easy, the night before the eclipse, to take a train back into the center of the zone, where totality would last the longest.</p>
<p>Two hours later I was in the Paris-East rail station and had purchased my ticket for Charleville-Mezieres. With ninety minutes to wait, I wandered around the station. It was evident that France had gone eclipse-happy. Every magazine had a cover story; every newspaper had a special insert; signs concerning the event were everywhere. Many of the magazines carried free eclipse glasses, with a black opaque metallic material for lenses that only the Sun can penetrate. Warnings against looking at the Sun without them were to be found on every newspaper front page. I soon learned that there had been a dreadful scandal in which a widely distributed shipment of imported glasses was discovered to be dangerously defective, leading the government to make a hurried and desperate attempt to recall them. There were also many leaflets advertising planned events in towns lying in the totality zone, and information about extra trains that would be running. A chaotic rush out of Paris was clearly expected.</p>
<p>Before noon I was on a train heading through the Paris suburbs into the farmlands of the Champagne region. The rocking of the train put me right to sleep, but the shrieking children halfway up the rail car quickly ended my nap. I watched the lovely sunlit French countryside as it rolled by. The Sun was by now well overhead &#8212; or rather, the Earth had rotated so that France was nearly facing the Sun head on. Sometimes, when the train banked on a turn, the light nearly blinded me, and I had to close my eyes.</p>
<p>With my eyelids shut, I thought about how I&#8217;d managed, over decades, to avoid ever once accidentally staring at the Sun for even a second&#8230; and about how almost every animal with eyes manages to do this during its entire life. It&#8217;s quite a feat, when you think about it. But it&#8217;s essential, of course. The Sun&#8217;s ferocious blaze is even worse than it appears, for it contains more than just visible light. It also radiates light too violet for us to see &#8212; ultraviolet &#8212; which is powerful enough to destroy our vision. Any animal lacking instincts powerful enough to keep its eyes off the Sun will go blind, soon to starve or be eaten. But humans are in danger during solar eclipses, because our intense curiosity can make us ignore our instincts. Many of us will suffer permanent eye damage, not understanding when and how it is safe to look at the Sun&#8230; which is almost, but not quite, never.</p>
<p>In fact the only time it is safe to look with the naked eye is during totality, when the Sun&#8217;s disk is completely blocked by the New Moon, and the world is dark. Then, and only then, can one see that the Sun is not a sphere, and that it has a sort of atmosphere, immense and usually unseen.</p>
<p>At the heart of the Sun, and source of its awesome power, is its nuclear furnace, nearly thirty million degrees hot and nearly five billion years old. All that heat gradually filters and boils out of the Sun&#8217;s core toward its visible surface, which is a mere six thousand degrees&#8230; still white-hot. Outside this region is a large irregular halo of material that is normally too dim to see against the blinding disk. The inner part of that halo is called the chromosphere; there, giant eruptions called &#8220;prominences&#8221; loop outward into space. The outer part of the halo is the &#8220;corona&#8221;, Latin for &#8220;crown.&#8221; The opportunity to see the Sun&#8217;s corona is one of the main reasons to seek totality.</p>
<p>Still very drowsy, but in a good mood, I arrived in Charleville. Wanting to leave my bags in the station while I looked for a hotel room, I searched for the luggage lockers. After three tiring trips around the station, I asked at a ticket booth. &#8220;Oh,&#8221; said the woman behind the desk, &#8220;we haven&#8217;t had them available since the Algerian terrorism of a few years ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>I gulped. This threatened plan B, for what was I to do with my luggage on eclipse day? I certainly couldn&#8217;t walk out into the French countryside looking for a place to camp while carrying a full suitcase and a sleeping bag! And even the present problem of looking for a hotel would be daunting. The woman behind the desk was sympathetic, but her only suggestion was to try one of the hotels near the station. Since the tourist information office was a mile away, it seemed the only good option, and I lugged my bags across the street.</p>
<p>Here, finally, luck smiled. The very first place I stopped at had a room for that night, reasonably priced and perfectly clean, if spartan. It was also available the night after the eclipse. My choice of Charleville had been wise. Unfortunately, even here, Eclipse Eve &#8212; Tuesday evening &#8212; was as bad as I imagined. The hoteliere assured me that all of Charleville was booked (and my later attempts to find a room, even a last-minute cancellation, proved fruitless.) Still, she she was happy for me to leave my luggage at the hotel while I tramped through the French countryside. Thus was Plan B saved.</p>
<p>Somewhat relieved, I wandered around the town. Charleville is not unattractive, and the orange sandstone 16th century architecture of its central square is very pleasing to the eye. By dusk I was exhausted and collapsed on my bed. I slept long and deep, and awoke refreshed. I took a short sightseeing trip by train, ate a delicious lunch, and tried one more time to find a room in Charleville for Eclipse Eve. Failing once again, I resolved to camp in the heart of the totality zone.</p>
<p>But where? I had several criteria in mind. For the eclipse, I wanted to be far from any large town or highway, so that streetlights, often automatically triggered by darkness, would not spoil the experience. Also I wanted hills and farmland; I wanted to be at a summit, with no trees nearby, in order to have the best possible view. It didn&#8217;t take long to decide on a location. About five miles south of the unassuming town of Rethel, rebuilt after total destruction in the first world war, my map showed a high hill. It seemed perfect.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I learned just in time that this same high hill had attracted the attention of the local authorities, and they had decided to designate this very place the &#8220;official viewing site&#8221; in the region. A hundred thousand people were expected to descend on Rethel and take shuttles from the town to the &#8220;site.&#8221; Clearly this was not where I wanted to be!</p>
<p>So instead, when I arrived in Rethel, I walked in another direction. I aimed for an area a few miles west of town, quiet hilly farmland.</p>
<p>Yet again, my luck seemed to be on the wane. By four it was drizzling, and by five it was raining. Darkness would settle at around eight, and I had little time to find a site for unobtrusive camping, much less a dry one. The rain stopped, restarted, hesitated, spat, but refused to go away. An unending mass of rain clouds could be seen heading toward me from the west. I had hoped to use trees for some shelter against rain, but now the trees were drenched and dripping, even worse than the rain itself.</p>
<p>Still completely unsure what I would do, I continued walking into the evening. I must have cut a very odd figure, carrying an open umbrella, a sleeping bag, and a small black backpack. I took a break in a village square, taking shelter at a church&#8217;s side door, where I munched on French bread and cheese. Maybe one of these farmers would let me sleep in a dry spot in his barn, I thought to myself. But I still hadn&#8217;t reached the hills I was aiming for, so I kept walking.</p>
<p>After another mile, I came to a hilltop with a dirt farm track crossing the road. There, just off the road to the right, was a large piece of farm machinery. And underneath it, a large, flat, sheltered spot. Hideous, but I could sleep there. Since it wasn&#8217;t quite nightfall yet and I could see a hill on the other side of the road along the same track, one which looked like it might be good for watching the eclipse, I took a few minutes to explore it. There I found another piece of farm equipment, also with a sheltered underbelly. This one was much further from the road, looked unused, and presumably offered both safer and quieter shelter. It was sitting just off the dirt track in a fallow field. The field was of thick, sticky, almost hard mud, the kind you don&#8217;t slip in and which doesn&#8217;t ooze but which gloms onto the sides of your shoe.</p>
<p>And so it was that Eclipse Eve found me spreading my poncho in a friendly unknown farmer&#8217;s field, twisting my body so as not to hit my head on the metal bars of my shelter, carefully unwrapping my sleeping bag and removing my shoes so as not to cover everything in mud, brushing my teeth in bottled water, and bedding down for the night. The whole scene was so absurd that I found myself sporting a slightly manic grin and giggling. But still, I was satisfied. Despite the odds, I was in the zone at the appointed time; when I awoke the next morning I would be scarcely two miles from my final destination. If the clouds were against me, so be it. I had done my part.</p>
<p>I slept pretty well, considering both my excitement and the uneven ground. At daybreak I was surrounded by fog, but by 8 a.m.~the fog was lifting, revealing a few spots of blue sky amid low clouds. My choice of shelter was also confirmed; my sleeping bag was dry, and across the road the other piece of machinery I had considered was already in use.</p>
<p>I packed up and started walking west again. The weather seemed uncertain, with three layers of clouds &#8212; low stratus, medium cumulus, and high cirrus &#8212; crossing over each other. Blue patches would appear, then close up. I trudged to the base of my chosen hill, then followed another dirt track to the top, where I was graced with a lovely view. The rolling <em>paysage</em> of fertile France stretched before me, blotched here and there with sunshine.  Again I had chosen well, better than I realized, as it turned out, for I was not alone on the hill. A Belgian couple had chosen it too &#8212; and they had a car&#8230;</p>
<p>There I waited. The minutes ticked by. The temperature fluctuated, and the fields changed color, as the Sun played hide and seek. I didn&#8217;t need these reminders of the Sun&#8217;s importance &#8212; that without its heat the Earth would freeze, and without its light, plants would not grow and the cycle of life would quickly end. I thought about how pre-scientific cultures had viewed the Sun. In cultures and religions around the world, the blazing disk has often been attributed divine power and regal authority. And why not? In the past century, we&#8217;ve finally learned what the Sun is made from and why it shines. But we are no less in awe than our ancestors, for the Sun is much larger, much older, and much more powerful than most of them imagined.</p>
<p>For a while, I listened to the radio. Crowds were assembling across Europe. Special events &#8212; concerts, art shows, contests &#8212; were taking place, organized by towns in the zone to coincide with the eclipse. This was hardly surprising. All those tourists had come for totality. But totality is brief, never more than a handful of minutes.  It&#8217;s the luck of geometry, the details of the orbits of the Earth and Moon, that set its duration. For my eclipse, the Moon&#8217;s shadow was only about a hundred miles wide. Racing along at three thousand miles per hour, it would darken any one location for at most two minutes. Now if a million people are expected to descend on your town for a two-minute event, I suppose it is a good idea to give them something else to do while they wait. And of course, the French cultural establishment loves this kind of opportunity. Multimedia events are their specialty, and they often give commissions to contemporary artists. I was particularly amused to discover later that an old acquaintance of mine &#8212; I met him in 1987 at the composers&#8217; entrance exams for the Paris Conservatory &#8212; had been commissioned to write an orchestral piece, called &#8220;Eclipse,&#8221; for the festival in the large city of Reims. It was performed just before the moment of darkness.</p>
<p>Finally, around 11:30, the eclipse began. The Moon nibbled a tiny notch out of the sun. I looked at it briefly through my eclipse glasses, and felt the first butterflies of anticipation. The Belgian couple, in their late fourties, came up to the top of the hill and stood alongside me. They were Flemish, but the man spoke French, and we chatted for a while. It turned out he was a scientist also, and had spent some time in the United States, so we had plenty to talk about. But our discussion kept turning to the clouds, which showed no signs of dissipating. The Sun was often veiled by thin cirrus or completely hidden by thick cumulus. We kept a nervous watch.</p>
<p>Time crawled as the Moon inched across the brilliant disk. It passed the midway point and the Sun became a crescent. With only twenty minutes before totality, my Belgian friends conversed in Dutch. The man turned to me. &#8220;We have decided to drive toward that hole in the clouds back to the east,&#8221; he said in French. &#8220;It&#8217;s really not looking so good here. Do you want to come with us?&#8221; I paused to think. How far away was that hole? Would we end up back at the town? Would we get caught in traffic? Would we end up somewhere low? What were my chances if I stayed where I was? I hesitated, unsure. If I went with them, I was subject to their whims, not my own. But after looking at the oncoming clouds one more time, I decided my present location was not favorable. I joined them.</p>
<p>We descended the dirt track and turned left onto the road I&#8217;d taken so long to walk. It was completely empty. We kept one eye on where we were going and five eyes on the sky. After two miles, the crescent sun became visible through a large gap in the low clouds. There were still high thin clouds slightly veiling it, but the sky around it was a pale blue. We went a bit further, and then stopped&#8230; at the very same dirt track where I had slept the night before. A line of ten or fifteen cars now stretched along it, but there was plenty of room for our vehicle.</p>
<p>By now, with ten minutes to go, the light was beginning to change. When only five percent of the Sun remains, your eye can really tell. The blues become deeper, the whites become milkier, and everything is more subdued. Also it becomes noticeably cooler. I&#8217;d seen this light before, in New Mexico in 1994. I had gone there to watch an &#8220;annular&#8221; eclipse of the Sun. An annular eclipse occurs when the Moon passes directly in front of the Sun but is just a bit too far away from the Earth for its shadow to reach the ground. In such an eclipse, the Moon fails to completely block the Sun; a narrow ringlet, or &#8220;annulus&#8221;, often called the &#8220;ring of fire,&#8221; remains visible. That day I watched from a mountain top, site of several telescopes, in nearly clear skies. But imagine the dismay of the spectators as the four-and-a-half minutes of annularity were blocked by a five-minute cloud! Fortunately there was a bright spot. For a brief instant &#8212; no more than three seconds &#8212; the cloud became thin, and a perfect circle of light shone through, too dim to penetrate eclipse glasses but visible with the naked eye&#8230; a veiled, surreal vision.</p>
<p>On the dirt track in the middle of French fields, we started counting down the minutes. There was more and more tension in the air. I put faster speed film into my camera. The light became still milkier, and as the crescent became a fingernail, all eyes were focused either on the Sun itself or on a small but thick and dangerous-looking cloud heading straight for it. Except mine. I didn&#8217;t care if I saw the last dot of sunlight disappear. What I wanted to watch was the coming of Moon-shadow.</p>
<p>One of my motivations for seeking a hill was that I wanted to observe the approach of darkness. Three thousand miles an hour is just under a mile per second, so if one had a view extending out five miles or so, I thought, one could really see the edge coming. I expected it would be much like watching the shadow of a cloud coming toward me, with the darkness sweeping along the ground, only much darker and faster. I looked to the west and waited for the drama to unfold.</p>
<p>And it did, but it was not what I was expecting. Even though observing the shadow is a common thing for eclipse watchers to do, nothing I had ever read about eclipses prepared me in the slightest for what I was about to witness. I&#8217;ve never seen it photographed, or even described. Maybe it was an effect of all the clouds around us. Or maybe others, just as I do, find it difficult to convey.</p>
<p>For how can one relate the sight of daylight sliding swiftly, like an sigh, to deep twilight? of the western sky, seen through scattered clouds, changing seamlessly and inexorably from blue to pink to slate gray to the last yellow of sunset? of colors rising up out of the horizon and spreading across the sky like water from a broken dyke flooding onto a field?</p>
<p>I cannot find the right combination of words to capture the sense of being swept up, of being overwhelmed, of being transfixed with awe, as one might be before the summoning of a great wave or a great wind by the command of a god, yet all in utter silence and great beauty. Reliving it as I write this brings a tear. In the end I have nothing to compare it to.</p>
<p>The great metamorphosis passed. The light stabilized. Shaken, I looked up.</p>
<p>And quickly looked away. I had seen a near-disk of darkness, the fuzzy whiteness of the corona, and some bright dots around the disk&#8217;s edge, one especially bright where the Sun still clearly shone through. Accidentally I had seen with my naked eyes the &#8220;diamond ring,&#8221; a moment when the last brilliant drop of Sun and the glistening corona are simultaneously visible. It&#8217;s not safe to look at. I glanced again. Still several bright dots. I glanced again. Still there &#8212; but the Sun had to be covered by now&#8230;</p>
<p>So I looked longer, and realized that the Sun was indeed covered, that those bright dots were there to stay. There it was. The eclipsed Sun, or rather, the dark disk of the New Moon, surrounded by the Sun&#8217;s crown, studded at its edge with seven bright pink jewels. It was bizarre, awe-inspiring, a spooky hallucination. It shimmered.</p>
<p>The Sun&#8217;s corona didn&#8217;t really resemble what I had seen in photographs, and I could immediately see why. The corona looked as though it were made of glistening white wispy hair, billowing outward like a mop of whiskers. It gleamed with a celestial light, a shine resembling that of well-lit tinsel. No camera could capture that glow, no photograph reproduce it.</p>
<p>But the greatest, most delightful surprise was the seven beautiful gems. I knew they had to be the great eruptions on the surface of the Sun, prominences, huge magnetic storms larger than our planet and more violent than anything else in the solar system. However, nobody ever told me they were bright pink! I always assumed they were orange (silly of me, since the whole Sun looks orange if you look at it through an orange filter, which the photographs always do.) They were arranged almost symmetrically around the sun, with one of them actually well separated from its surface and halfway out into the lovely soft filaments of the corona. I explored them with my binoculars. The colors, the glistening timbre, the rich detail, it is a visual delight. The scene is living, vibrant, delicate and soft; by comparison, all the photographs and films seem dry, flat, deadened.</p>
<p>I was surprised at my calm. After the great rush of the shadow, the stasis of totality had caught me off guard.  Around me it was much lighter than I had expected. The sense was of late twilight, with a deep blue-purple sky; yet it was still bright enough to read by. The yellow light of late sunset stretched all the way around the horizon. The planet Venus was visible, but no stars peeked through the clouds. Perhaps longer eclipses have darker skies, a larger Moon-shadow putting daylight further away.</p>
<p>I had scarcely had time to absorb all of this when, just at the halfway point of totality, the dangerous-looking cumulus cloud finally arrived, and blotted out the view. A groan, but only a half-hearted one, emerged from the spectators; after all we&#8217;d seen what we&#8217;d come to see. I took in the colors emanating from the different parts of the sky, and then looked west again, waiting for the light to return. A thin red glow touched the horizon. I waited. Suddenly the red began to grow furiously. I yelled &#8220;Il revient!&#8221; &#8212; it is returning! &#8212; and then watched in awe as the reds became pinks, swarmed over us, turned yellow-white&#8230;</p>
<p>And then&#8230; it was daylight again. Normality, or a slightly muted version of it. The magical show was over, heavenly love had been consummated, we who had traveled far had been rewarded. The weather had been kind to us. There was a pause as we savored the experience, and waited for our brains to resume functioning. Then congratulations were passed around as people shook hands and hugged each other. I thanked my Belgian friends, who like me were smiling broadly. They offered me a ride back to town. I almost accepted, but stopped short, and instead thanked them again and told them I somehow wanted to be outside for a while longer. We exchanged addresses, said goodbyes, they drove off.</p>
<p>I started retracing my steps from the previous evening. As I walked back to the town of Rethel in the returning sunshine, the immensity of what I had seen began gradually to make its way through my skin into my blood, making me teary-eyed. I thought about myself, a scientist, educated and knowledgeable about the events that had just taken place, and tried to imagine what would have happened to me today if I had not had<br />
that knowledge and had found myself, unexpectedly, in the Moon&#8217;s shadow.</p>
<p>It was not difficult; I had only to imagine what I would feel if the sky suddenly, without any warning, turned a fiery red instead of blue and began to howl. It would have been a living nightmare. The terror that I would have felt would have penetrated my bones. I would have fallen on my knees in panic; I would have screamed and wept; I would have called on every deity I knew and others I didn&#8217;t know for help; I would have despaired; I would have thought death or hell had come; I would have assumed my life was about to end. The two minutes of darkness, filled with the screams and cries of my neighbors, would have been timeless, maddening. When the Sun just as suddenly returned, I would have collapsed onto the ground with relief, profusely and weepingly thanking all of the deities for restoring the world to its former condition, and would have rushed home to relatives and friends, hoping to find some comfort and solace.</p>
<p>I would have sought explanations. I would have been willing to consider anything: dragons eating the Sun, spirits seeking to punish our village or country for its transgressions, evil and spiteful monsters trying to freeze the Earth, gods warning us of terrible things to come in future. But above all, <em>I could never, never have imagined that </em><em>this brief spine-chilling extinction and transformation of the Sun was a natural </em><em>phenomenon.</em> Nothing so spectacular and sudden and horrifying could have been the work of mere matter. It would once and for all have convinced me of the existence of creatures greater and more powerful than human beings, if I had previously had any doubt.</p>
<p>And I would have been forever changed. No longer could I have entirely trusted the regularity of days and nights, of seasons, of years. For the rest of my life I would have always found myself glancing at the sky, wanting to make sure that all, for the moment, was well. For if the Sun could suddenly vanish for two minutes, perhaps the next time it could vanish for two hours, or two days&#8230; or two centuries. Or forever.</p>
<p>I pondered the impact that eclipses, both solar and lunar, have had throughout human history. They have shaped civilizations. Wars and slaughters were begun and ended on their appearance; they sent ordinary people to their deaths as appeasement sacrifices; new gods and legends were invoked to give meaning to them. The need to predict them, and the coincidences which made their prediction possible, helped give birth to astronomy as a mathematically precise science, in China, in Greece, in modern Europe &#8212; developments without which my profession, and even my entire technologically-based culture, might not exist.</p>
<p>It was an hour&#8217;s walk to Rethel, but that afternoon it was a long journey. It took me across the globe to nations ancient and distant. By the time I reached the town, I&#8217;d communed with my ancestors, reconsidered human history, and examined anew my tiny place in the universe.  If I&#8217;d been a bit calm during totality itself, I wasn&#8217;t anymore. What I&#8217;d seen was gradually filtering, with great potency, into my soul.</p>
<p>I took the train back to Charleville, and slept dreamlessly. The next two days were an opportunity to unwind, to explore, and to eat well. On my last evening I returned to Paris to visit my old haunts. I managed to sneak into the courtyard of the apartment house where I had had a one-room garret up five flights of stairs, with its spartan furnishings and its one window that looked over the roofs of Paris to the Eiffel Tower. I wandered past the old Music Conservatory, since moved to the northeast corner of town, and past the bookstore where I bought so much music. My favorite bakery was still open.</p>
<p>That night I slept in an airport hotel, and the next day flew happily home to the American continent. I never did find my driver&#8217;s license.</p>
<p>But psychological closure came already on the day following the eclipse. I spent that day in Laon, a small city perched magnificently atop a rocky hill that rises vertically out of the French plains. I wandered its streets and visited its sights &#8212; an attractive church, old houses, pleasant old alleyways, ancient walls and gates. As evening approached I began walking about, looking for a restaurant, and I came to the northwestern edge of town overlooking the new city and the countryside beyond. The clouds had parted, and the Sun, looking large and dull red, was low in the sky. I leaned on the city wall and watched as the turning Earth carried me, and Laon, and all of France, at hundreds of miles an hour, intent on placing itself between me and the Sun. Yet another type of solar eclipse, one we call &#8220;sunset.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ruddy disk touched the horizon. I remembered the wispy white mane and the brilliant pink jewels. In my mind the Sun had always been grand and powerful, life-giver and taker, essential and dangerous. It could blind, burn, and kill.  I respected it, was impressed and awed by it, gave thanks for it, swore at it, feared it. But in the strange light of totality, I had seen beyond its unforgiving, blazing sphere, and glimpsed a softer side of the Sun. With its feathery hair blowing in a dark sky, it had seemed delicate, even vulnerable. It is, I thought to myself, as mortal as we.</p>
<p>The distant French hills rose across its face. As it waned, I found myself feeling a warmth, even a tenderness &#8212; affection for this giant glowing ball of hydrogen, this protector of our planet, this lonely beacon in a vast emptiness&#8230; the only star you and I will ever know.</p>
