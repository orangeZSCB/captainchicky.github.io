										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Last Thursday, <a href="https://muon-g-2.fnal.gov/">an experiment reported</a> that the magnetic properties of the muon, the electron&#8217;s middleweight cousin, are a tiny bit different from what particle physics equations say they should be.  All around the world, the headlines screamed: <strong>PHYSICS IS BROKEN!!!</strong> And indeed, it&#8217;s been pretty shocking to physicists everywhere. For instance, my equations are working erratically; many of the calculations I tried this weekend came out upside-down or backwards.  Even worse, my stove froze my coffee instead of heating it, I just barely prevented my car from floating out of my garage into the trees, and my desk clock broke and spilled time all over the floor.  What a mess!</p>



<p>&#8212;</p>



<p>Broken, eh?  When we say a coffee machine or a computer is broken, it means it doesn&#8217;t work. It&#8217;s unavailable until it&#8217;s fixed.  When a glass is broken, it&#8217;s shattered into pieces.  We need a new one. I know it&#8217;s cute to say that so-and-so&#8217;s video &#8220;broke the internet.&#8221;  But aren&#8217;t we going a little too far now?  Nothing&#8217;s broken about physics; it works just as well today as it did a month ago.</p>



<p>More reasonable headlines have suggested that &#8220;the laws of physics have been broken&#8221;. That&#8217;s better; I know what it means to break a law.  (Though the metaphor is imperfect, since if I were to break a state law, I&#8217;d be punished, whereas if an object were to break a fundamental law of physics, that law would have to be revised!)  But as is true in the legal system, not all physics laws, and not all violations of law, are equally significant.  </p>



<p>What&#8217;s a physics law, anyway? Crudely, physics is a strategy for making predictions about the behavior of physical objects, based on a set of equations <em>and</em> a conceptual framework for using those equations.  Sometimes we refer to the equations as laws; sometimes parts of the conceptual framework are referred to that way.  </p>



<p>But that story has layers.   Physics has an underlying conceptual foundation, which includes the pillar of quantum physics and its view of reality, and the pillar of Einstein&#8217;s relativity and its view of space and time.  (There are other pillars too, such as those of statistical mechanics, but let me not complicate the story now.) That foundation supports many research areas of physics.  Within particle physics itself, these two pillars are combined into a more detailed framework, with concepts and equations that go by the name of &#8220;quantum effective field theory&#8221; (&#8220;QEFT&#8221;).  But QEFT is still very <strong>general</strong>; this framework can describe an enormous number of possible universes, most with completely different particles and forces from the ones we have in our own universe.  We can start making predictions for real-world experiments only when we put the electron, the muon, the photon, and all the other familiar particles and forces into our equations, building up a <strong>specific</strong> example of a QEFT known as &#8220;<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/">The Standard Model of particle physics</a>.&#8221;  </p>



<p>All along the way there are equations and rules that you might call &#8220;laws.&#8221;  They too come in layers.  The Standard Model itself, as a specific QEFT, has few high-level laws: there are no principles telling us why quarks exist, why there is one type of photon rather than two, or why the weak nuclear force is so weak.  The few laws it does have are mostly low-level, true of our universe but not essential to it.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m bringing attention to these layers because an experiment might cause a problem for one layer but not another.   I think you could only fairly suggest that &#8220;physics is broken&#8221; if data were putting a foundational pillar of the entire field into question.  And to say &#8220;the laws of physics have been violated&#8221;, emphasis on the word &#8220;<strong>the</strong>&#8220;, is a bit melodramatic if the only thing that&#8217;s been violated is a low-level, dispensable law.</p>



<p>&#8212;</p>



<p>Has physics, as a whole, <strong>ever</strong> broken?  You could argue that Newton&#8217;s 17th century foundation, which underpinned the next two centuries of physics, broke at the turn of the 20th century.   Just after 1900, Newton-style equations had to be replaced by equations of a substantially different type; the ways physicists used the equations changed, and the concepts, the language, and even the goals of physics changed. For instance, in Newtonian physics, you can predict the outcome of any experiment, at least in principle; in post-Newtonian quantum physics, you often can only predict the probability for one or another outcome, even in principle. And in Newtonian physics we all agree what time it is; in Einsteinian physics, different observers experience time differently and there is no universal clock that we all agree on.  These were immense changes in the foundation of the field.</p>



<p>Conversely, you could also argue that physics didn&#8217;t break; it was just remodeled and expanded.  No one who&#8217;d been studying steam engines or wind erosion or electrical circuit diagrams had to throw out their books and start again from scratch.  In fact this &#8220;broken&#8221; Newtonian physics is still taught in physics classes, and many physicists and engineers never use anything else.  If you&#8217;re studying the physics of weather, or building a bridge, Newtonian physics is just fine. The fact that Newton-style equations are an <strong>incomplete</strong> description of the world &#8212; that there are phenomena they can&#8217;t describe properly &#8212; doesn&#8217;t invalidate them when they&#8217;re applied within their wheelhouse.</p>



<p>No matter which argument you prefer, it&#8217;s hard to see how to justify the phrase &#8220;physics is broken&#8221; without a profound revolution that overthrows foundational concepts.  It&#8217;s rare for a serious threat to foundations to arise suddenly, because few experiments can single-handedly put fundamental principles at risk.  <em>[The infamous case of the &#8220;faster-than-light neutrinos&#8221; provides an exception.  Had that experiment been correct, it would have invalidated Einstein&#8217;s relativity principles. But few of us were surprised when <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/neutrinos-faster-than-light/opera-what-went-wrong/">a glaring error turned up</a>.]</em></p>



<p>&#8212;</p>



<p>In the Standard Model, the electron, muon and tau particles (known as the &#8220;charged leptons&#8221;) are all identical except for their masses. <em>(More fundamentally, they have different interactions with <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/">the Higgs field</a>, from which their rest masses arise.)</em>  This almost-identity is sometimes stated as a &#8220;principle of lepton universality.&#8221;  <strong><em>Oh, wow, a principle &#8212; a law!</em></strong>  But here&#8217;s the thing.  Some principles are enormously important; the principles of Einsteinian relativity determine how cause and effect work in our universe, and you can&#8217;t drop them without running into big paradoxes.  Other principles are weak, and could easily be discarded without making a mess of any other part of physics.  The principle of lepton universality is one of these.   In fact, if you extend the Standard Model by adding new particles to its equations, it can be difficult to <em>avoid</em> ruining this fragile principle.  <em>[In a sense, the Higgs field has already violated the principle, but we don&#8217;t hold that against it.]</em></p>



<p>All the fuss is about a new experimental result which confirms an older one and slightly disagrees with the latest theoretical predictions, which are made using the Standard Model&#8217;s equations.  What could be the cause of the discrepancy?  One possibility is that it arises from a previously unknown difference between muons and electrons &#8212; from a violation of the principle of lepton universality.  For those who live and breathe particle physics, breaking lepton universality would be a big deal; there&#8217;d be lots of adventure in trying to figure out which of the many possible extensions of the Standard Model could actually explain what broke this law. That&#8217;s why the scientists involved sound so excited.  </p>



<p>But the failure of  lepton universality wouldn&#8217;t come as a huge surprise. From certain points of view, the surprise is that the principle has survived this long!  Since this low-level law is easily violated, its demise may not lead us to a profound new understanding of the world. It&#8217;s way too early for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/07/science/particle-physics-muon-fermilab-brookhaven.html">headlines that argue that what&#8217;s at stake is the existence of &#8220;forms of matter and energy vital to the nature and evolution of the cosmos.&#8221;</a> No one can say how much is at stake; it might be a lot, or just a little.</p>



<p>In particular, there&#8217;s absolutely <em>no</em> evidence that <strong><em>physics</em></strong> is broken, or even that <strong><em>particle physics</em></strong> is broken.  The pillars of physics and QEFT are not (yet) threatened.  Even to say that &#8220;<strong><em>the Standard Model </em></strong>might be broken&#8221; seems a bit melodramatic to me.  Does adding a new wing to a house require &#8220;breaking&#8221; the house? Typically you can still live in the place while it&#8217;s being extended. The Standard Model&#8217;s many successes suggest that it might survive largely intact as a recognizable part of a larger, more complete set of equations.</p>



<p>In any case, right now it&#8217;s still too early to say <strong>anything</strong> so loudly.  The apparent discrepancy may not survive the heavy scrutiny it is coming under. There&#8217;s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2021/04/08/why-you-should-doubt-new-physics-from-the-latest-muon-g-2-results/?sh=4443b8616c4b">plenty of controversy</a> about the theoretical prediction for muon magnetism; the required calculation is extraordinarily complex, elaborate and difficult.  </p>



<p>So, from my perspective, the headlines of the past week are way over the top.  The idea that a single measurement of the muon&#8217;s magnetism could &#8220;<a href="https://www.livescience.com/muon-wobble-could-break-physics.html">shake physics to its core</a>&#8220;, as claimed in another headline I happened upon, is amusing at best.   Physics, and its older subdisciplines, have over time become very difficult to break, or even shake.  That&#8217;s the way it should be, when science is working properly.  And that&#8217;s why we can safely base the modern global economy on scientific knowledge; it&#8217;s unlikely that a single surprise could instantly invalidate large chunks of its foundation.</p>



<p>Some readers may view the extreme, click-baiting headlines as harmless.  Maybe I&#8217;m overly concerned about them. But don&#8217;t they implicitly suggest that one day we will suddenly find physics &#8220;upended&#8221;, and in need of a complete top-to-bottom overhaul?  To imply physics can &#8220;break&#8221; so easily makes a mockery of science&#8217;s strengths, and obscures the process by which scientific knowledge is obtained.  And how can it be good to claim &#8220;physics is broken&#8221; and &#8220;the laws of physics have been broken&#8221; over and over and over again, in stories that almost never merit that level of hype and eventually turn out to have been much ado about nada?  The constant manufacturing of scientific crisis cannot possibly be lost on readers, who I suspect are becoming increasingly jaded.   At some point readers may become as skeptical of science journalism, and the science it describes, as they are of advertising; <em>it&#8217;s all lies, so <strong>caveat emptor</strong></em>.   That&#8217;s not where we want our society to be.  As we are seeing in spades during the current pandemic, there can be serious consequences when &#8220;<strong>TRUST IN SCIENCE IS BROKEN!!!</strong>&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8212;</p>



<p><em>A final footnote: Ironically, the Standard Model itself poses one of the biggest threats to the framework of QEFT. The discovery of the Higgs boson <strong>and nothing else (so far)</strong> at the Large Hadron Collider poses a conceptual challenge &#8212; the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/naturalness/">&#8220;naturalness&#8221; problem</a>. There&#8217;s no sharp paradox, which is why I can&#8217;t promise you that the framework of QEFT will someday break if it isn&#8217;t resolved. But the breakdown of lepton universality might someday <strong>help</strong> solve the naturalness problem, by requiring a more &#8220;natural&#8221; extension of the Standard Model, and thus might actually <strong>save</strong> QEFT instead of &#8220;breaking&#8221; it.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago there was (justified) hullabaloo following <a title="BICEP2: New Evidence Of Cosmic Inflation!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/bicep2-new-evidence-of-cosmic-inflation/" target="_blank">the release of results from the BICEP2 experiment</a>, which (if correct as an experiment, and if correctly interpreted) may indicate the detection of gravitational waves that were generated at an extremely early stage in the universe (or at least in its current phase)&#8230; during a (still hypothetical but increasingly plausible) stage known as <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">cosmic inflation</a>.  (Here&#8217;s my description of the <a title="History of the Universe" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/" target="_blank">history of the early universe</a> as we currently understand it, and my cautionary tale on <a title="Which Parts of the Big Bang Theory are Reliable, and Why?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/26/which-parts-of-the-big-bang-theory-are-reliable/" target="_blank">which parts of the history are well understood (and why) and which parts are not</a>.)</p>
<p>During that wild day or two following the announcement, a number of scientists stated that this was &#8220;the first <strong>direct</strong> observation of gravitational waves&#8221;.  Others, including me, emphasized that this was an &#8220;<strong>indirect</strong> observation of gravitational waves.&#8221;  I&#8217;m sure many readers noticed this discrepancy.  Who was right?</p>
<p>No one was wrong, not on this point anyway.  It was a matter of perspective. Since I think some readers would be interested to understand this point, here&#8217;s the story, and you can make your own judgment.<span id="more-7610"></span></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll describe</p>
<ol>
<li>a past observation of gravitational waves that everyone agrees is indirect;</li>
<li>a future observation of gravitational waves that we expect to happen fairly soon, one that I believe everyone will agree is direct;</li>
<li>BICEP2, and how you can view it either way, depending on your perspective.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>A Past <span style="color:#800000;">Indirect</span> Observation of Gravitational Waves</strong></p>
<p>First, let me describe what everyone agrees was the first observation of gravitational waves, and was definitely <strong>indirect</strong>.  In 1974, two scientists (Joseph Taylor and his graduate student Russell Hulse) discovered a pulsar.  A pulsar is a city-sized neutron star (made entirely from <a title="The Nuclei of Atoms: At the Heart of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-nuclei-of-atoms-at-the-heart-of-matter/" target="_blank">neutrons</a> and resulting from a <a title="Supernovas and Neutrino Speeds" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/neutrinos-faster-than-light/opera-some-arguments-against/supernovas-and-neutrino-speeds/" target="_blank">Type IIa supernova</a>) that spins rapidly &#8212; rotating many times per second &#8212; and, due to its powerful magnetic field, sends strong radio beams into space, which sweep past the Earth as the pulsar spins.  We observe this as a pulsing radio signal from the location of the star.</p>
<p>Pulsars are common, but this one was special.  Its frequency of pulsing (i.e. how many times per second does it pulse) varied slightly, growing and shrinking every 7 hours and 45 minutes.  It quickly became clear this was due to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_Doppler_effect" target="_blank">the Doppler effect for radio waves</a>; the pulsar was sometimes moving toward us, and sometimes away, because <em>it was in orbit around something else</em>.  Detailed study (using the Newton/Einstein laws of gravity) allowed Hulse and Taylor to infer that what they were seeing was a pulsar orbiting a second neutron star.  They could even figure out the orientation and size of the orbit!</p>
<p>Having figured this out, they could do one more thing.  Einstein&#8217;s laws of gravity predict that the gravitational waves &#8212; waves in space itself &#8212; that are created by these two stars as they orbit one another, and these waves should be carrying energy out into space, reducing the energy available to the two stars.  The effect of this loss of energy would be a very mild reduction in the time (or &#8220;period&#8221;) that it takes for the two stars to orbit each other &#8212; but not by very much!  The period of the orbit, about 28,000 seconds, is predicted by Einstein&#8217;s equations to be shrinking by a bit more than one second per year.</p>
<p>Fortunately, pulsars are stable enough, and Hulse and Taylor&#8217;s measurements were easily accurate enough, that this change of about a second per year was relatively easy for them to measure during the ensuing decade.  And they could compare their measurements of the change in the period with the predictions of Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity.  Remarkably, the agreement of the theory with the data is excellent!  For this confirmation of Einstein&#8217;s theory&#8217;s prediction of gravitational waves, Hulse and Taylor received the Nobel Prize in 1993.</p>
<p><div style="width: 342px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img title="Graph showing the cumulative shift of periastron time for PSR 1913+16. This shows the decrease of the orbital period as the two stars spiral together." src="https://i0.wp.com/www.astro.cardiff.ac.uk/research/gravity/resources/hulse_taylor.jpg" alt="Graph showing the cumulative shift of periastron time for PSR 1913+16. This shows the decrease of the orbital period as the two stars spiral together." width="332" height="307" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Hulse and Taylor&#8217;s data (black dots) for the reduction in the period of the neutron stars&#8217; orbit compared to Einstein&#8217;s theory&#8217;s prediction (solid line) of how the orbit should change due to the emission of gravitational waves. (General Relativity is the name of Einstein&#8217;s Theory of gravity.) Notice how remarkably precise is the agreement over decades!</p></div></p>
<p>Hulse and Taylor had thus observed the effect of gravitational waves for the first time in human history. But they hadn&#8217;t observed the waves themselves; they&#8217;d observed <strong>the loss of energy</strong>, in the neutron star pair, <strong>due</strong> to the waves, but not the waving of space, compressing and expanding as the waves move by. Clearly, this detection of gravitational waves was <strong>indirect</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>A Future, Likely <span style="color:#008000;">Direct</span> Detection of Gravitational Waves</strong></p>
<p>A direct search for gravitational waves is underway now, at experiments known as <a href="http://www.ligo-la.caltech.edu/LLO/overviewsci.htm" target="_blank">LIGO</a> and <a href="http://www.ego-gw.it/public/about/whatis.aspx" target="_blank">VIRGO</a>.  When a gravitational wave passes by the Earth, space itself grows and shrinks a little bit, and the distances between objects increases and decreases.  It&#8217;s an incredibly tiny effect even for powerful gravitational waves; you and I would never notice it.  But this shrinking and growing of space can potentially be observed with extremely stable, carefully designed lasers looking for the distance between two mirrors to shift by less than the radius of a <a title="The Nuclei of Atoms: At the Heart of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-nuclei-of-atoms-at-the-heart-of-matter/" target="_blank">proton</a>, which itself is 100,000 times smaller than the radius of an <a title="Atoms: Their Inner Workings" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/atoms-building-blocks-of-molecules/atoms-their-inner-workings/" target="_blank">atom</a>!  <em>[The principles involved are not so different from those used in the famous <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/relativ/mmhist.html" target="_blank">Michelson-Morley experiment</a> &#8212; but the experimental requirements are vastly greater!]</em></p>
<p>When the repeated changing of the distance between mirrors due to a stretching and compression of space is actually observed, that will clearly be <strong>direct</strong> observation of waves of space itself &#8212; gravitational waves.  This hasn&#8217;t happened yet, but the &#8220;Advanced&#8221; phase of LIGO is coming up very soon, starting this year.  We may well see LIGO make discoveries within the decade.</p>
<p><strong>BICEP2: <span style="color:#ff6600;">Direct or Indirect</span>?</strong></p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s very clear that BICEP2 &#8212; <em>IF the experiment&#8217;s results are correct (they have not been confirmed by another experiment yet) and IF they are correctly interpreted as due to gravitational waves (which is still an open question)</em> &#8212;represents an advance over the Hulse-Taylor discovery.  But it&#8217;s not as direct as LIGO, either.</p>
<p>BICEP2&#8217;s measurement [<a title="A Primer On Today’s Events" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/a-primer-on-todays-events/" target="_blank">see here for some details</a>]  is actually of the polarization of light  that was released 380,000 years after the Hot Big Bang began, at the time when the universe cooled enough to become transparent. This light has now become the &#8220;cosmic microwave background&#8221; [CMB] which we observe today coming from all directions in the sky.  So really they&#8217;re directly observing light (microwaves rather than visible light), not waves in space itself &#8212; gravitational waves.</p>
<p>But the nature and size of the polarization effect they observe (&#8220;B-mode&#8221; polarization, across large swathes of sky) is believed to have only one possible source: gravitational waves, created in the early universe and ringing for 380,000 years, and then interacting with the light that is now the CMB.  It is the squeezing and stretching of space within which the light is moving that causes the light to end up polarized in a unique way.</p>
<p>In this sense, you could say that the CMB is providing a sort of unusual photograph of gravitational waves, taken at 380,000 years post-Big-Bang.  It gives far, far more detail about their nature than does the Hulse-Taylor measurement; it confirms more and different things that Einstein predicted, such as the fact that these gravitational waves have &#8220;spin two&#8221;, which is necessary for them to give B-mode polarization.  If you think of it as a photograph, BICEP2&#8217;s measurement seems pretty direct.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, it&#8217;s nowhere near as direct as LIGO would be, where mirrors that humans have set up will actually move back and forth as a gravitational wave&#8217;s crests and troughs pass by.  Far, far more detail will be available when that happens &#8212; and there will be little or no ambiguity about the interpretation of the data.  For BICEP2, it&#8217;s still conceivable (though no one has thought of anything specific) that the B-mode polarization actually is not due to gravitational waves but is due to something else.  The very fact that this is conceivable &#8212; that maybe the polarization comes from something other than waves in space itself &#8212; reflects the fact that the BICEP2 data involves looking at something that happened billions of years ago in very distant locations, and drawing inferences.  BICEP2 isn&#8217;t itself seeing space shrink and expand; it&#8217;s observing polarized light created long ago, and then scientists are inferring that the pattern of its polarization is due to space shrinking and expanding. From that point of view, BICEP2&#8217;s detection is still rather indirect.</p>
<p>So call it what you will, it&#8217;s clearly (if correct and correctly interpreted) more direct than Hulse and Taylor&#8217;s measurement, and less direct than a detection at LIGO would be.  Maybe we should call it &#8220;(&#8230;nnnn)direct&#8221;?  In any case, what we call it isn&#8217;t important; what&#8217;s important is to figure out whether it&#8217;s correct, and what it means.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our quantum world has many odd and counter-intuitive features.  One of these is &#8220;tunneling&#8221; &#8212; the ability of objects to pass through walls, escape from traps, and slip under mountains into the next valley.   We don&#8217;t encounter this effect in daily life; objects we&#8217;re used to are so incredibly unlikely to tunnel from one place to another that we will never hear of one doing the apparently impossible.   But in the atomic and subatomic realms, even in various types of modern technology, tunneling is an essential and commonplace feature of the quantum reality in which we live.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve written a short article about this phenomenon, <a title="Tunneling: A Quantum Process" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/tunneling-a-quantum-process/" target="_blank">which you can read here</a>, emphasizing the central role that tunneling plays in the world&#8217;s most powerful microscopes.  It should be suitable for anyone who has read a little about <a title="Atoms: Their Inner Workings" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/atoms-building-blocks-of-molecules/atoms-their-inner-workings/" target="_blank">atoms</a>.</p>
<p>This article lays the groundwork for a discussion of how tunneling could someday, in the distant future, end the universe as we know it.  It also prepares the way for a more advanced post about how a single physics theory (i.e., a set of equations designed to describe some aspect of nature) may have multiple `vacua&#8217; (i.e. multiple solutions that each represent different ways that the universe could be configured &#8212; what empty space could be like, and what types of fields, forces and particles could be found in the universe &#8212; over long periods of time.)  If that&#8217;s confusing, stay tuned for a few days; I&#8217;ll soon explain it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nothing about quantum physics today, but &#8230; wait, <em>everything</em> is made using quantum physics&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Could you imagine getting a dog to sit absolutely still, while fully awake and listening to voices, for as much as 8 minutes? Researchers trained dogs to do it, then put them in an MRI [Magnetic Resonance Imaging] machine to obtain remarkable studies of how dogs&#8217; brains react to human voices and other emotional forms of human expression. [<a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/nuclear/mri.html" target="_blank">MRI is all about</a> magnetic fields, <a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/" target="_blank">protons</a>, spin, and resonance; particle physics!! more on that another time, perhaps.]   The authors claim this is the first study of its type to compare human brains to those of a non-primate species. Here&#8217;s something from <a href="http://www.cell.com/current-biology/retrieve/pii/S0960982214001237" target="_blank">the scientific article&#8217;s abstract</a>:</p>
<p><em>&#8230;</em><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;"><em>We presented dogs and humans with the same set of vocal and non-vocal stimuli to search for functionally analogous voice-sensitive cortical regions. We demonstrate that voice areas exist in dogs and that they show a similar pattern to anterior temporal voice areas in humans. Our findings also reveal that sensitivity to vocal emotional valence cues engages similarly located non-primary auditory regions in dogs and humans&#8230;</em> </span></p>
<p>So it seems, as dog owners have long suspected, that we&#8217;re not just imagining that our best friends are aware of our moods; they really are similar to us in some important ways.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a BBC article: <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-26276660" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-26276660</a></p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;re done with that, would you like to build up your muscles?  No exercise needed, just call the University of Texas at Dallas.  They&#8217;ve found that <em>&#8220;ordinary fishing line and sewing thread can be cheaply converted to powerful artificial muscles.  The new muscles can lift 100 times more weight and generate 100 times higher mechanical power than a human muscle of the same length and weight&#8230; The muscles are powered thermally by temperature changes, which can be produced electrically, by the absorption of light or by the chemical reaction of fuels.&#8221;</em>  [Quantum Physics = cool!!] The quotation above is from <a href="http://www.utdallas.edu/news/2014/2/21-28701_Researchers-Create-Powerful-Muscles-From-Fishing-L_story-wide.html" target="_blank">an interesting press release from the university</a>, reporting the research which was just published in the journal <em>Science</em>.  I recommend the press release because it mentions several interesting possible applications, including robotics technology  and clothing that adjusts to temperature.  Here&#8217;s also a nice article by Anna Kuchment (who&#8217;s on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/akuchment" target="_blank">here</a>):</p>
<p><a href="http://www.utdallas.edu/news/2014/2/21-28701_Researchers-Create-Powerful-Muscles-From-Fishing-L_story-wide.html" target="_blank">http://www.utdallas.edu/news/2014/2/21-28701_Researchers-Create-Powerful-Muscles-From-Fishing-L_story-wide.html</a></p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Though evolution left us with many wonderful abilities, it does seem that, year by year, humans are becoming less and less practically useful.   But at least our dogs will comfort us in our obsolescence.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome 2014! And quite a start to the year, with a cold snap that rivals anything we&#8217;ve seen in two decades. I don&#8217;t remember cold like this since the horrid winter of 1994, when the Northeastern U.S. saw snowstorms and extreme cold that alternated back and forth for weeks. Of course, when I was a child in the 1970s, such chills happened a lot more often; I remember a number of New England mornings where I awoke to a thermometer reading of -20ºFahrenheit (-29ºCelsius) [244 Kelvin].</p>
<p>The scariest negative temperature numbers that one hears about from the media are associated with the &#8220;wind chill&#8221;, which is a number that is supposed to measure how cold the air &#8220;feels&#8221; to your skin.  But &#8220;wind chill&#8221; is a rather subjective and controversial measure &#8212; there&#8217;s no unique way to define it, since you&#8217;ll feel differently depending on how much exposed skin you have, on your body weight, on your age and conditioning, etc.  By contrast, the temperature measured by a thermometer is defined independent of how humans feel, and experts agree on what it is and means. Oh sure, people use different scales to measure it: Fahrenheit (F), Centigrade or Celsius (C), and Kelvin (K).  But the differences are no more than the distinction between meters and feet, or between kilograms and pounds; it&#8217;s straightforward, if a bit annoying, to convert from one to the other.</p>
<p>So everyone agrees the temperature is and <em>feels</em> extremely cold, But <strong>is it</strong>, from the point of nature, <strong>really that much colder than usual?</strong> To say it another way: it was 84ºF (29ºC) in southern Florida yesterday.  How much warmer is that than the -40ºF (-40ºC) that was registered in the cold Minnesota morning?</p>
<p>Well, you might first think: wow, it&#8217;s a difference of 124ºF (69ºC), which sounds like a <strong>huge</strong> difference.  But is it really so huge?<span id="more-7087"></span></p>
<p><strong>Perception and Reality</strong></p>
<p>We humans experience the world through our perceptions and our consciousness &#8212; through what we see, hear, feel, and so forth. And as is natural, we tend to assume that what we see, hear and feel correctly represents the world <em>as it is</em>. But in fact, as scientists have learned over the past centuries, the devices we use for our perceptions &#8212; eyes, ears, temperature-sensing nerves, and so on &#8212; filter and process the information that they receive from the outside world. Our brain then does further processing.  By the time the information enters our conscious notion of the world, the world has become a caricature, a cartoon, of the real thing.  Much of the world is ignored, and the part that we are conscious of is transformed almost beyond recognition.</p>
<p>Indeed, one of the first things young science students have to do is unlearn almost everything our senses and brains tell us about the world, and relearn it almost from scratch.</p>
<p>So it is with hot and cold. In the real world there is no such thing as a &#8220;hot object&#8221; or a &#8220;cold object.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, there really <strong>is</strong> such a thing as temperature. One can speak of &#8220;hotter&#8221; and &#8220;colder&#8221;; if A is hotter than B, then, very simply, A has a higher temperature than B.</p>
<p>But it makes no sense to say &#8220;A <strong><em>is</em></strong> hot&#8221;. The statement that &#8220;A is hot&#8221; is a misconception, a trick that our senses play on us.  What this really just means is that, to your skin&#8217;s nerves, &#8220;A <strong><em>feels</em></strong> hot&#8221;. And what that usually means, in the real world, is &#8220;A is hotter &#8212; has a higher temperature &#8212; than your skin&#8221;.  As always the full story&#8217;s a bit more complicated, but not too much.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s always good when you can do a simple experiment, on your own, to reveal some basic fact about the world.  There&#8217;s a nice one in this case. Take three bowls; fill one with ice water (literally, water with ice in it), fill a second with water that&#8217;s almost too hot for you to put your hand in, and fill the third with ordinary tap water that&#8217;s lukewarm. Now put your left hand in the ice water and your right hand in the hot water. After a minute or so, take them out and put them both in the tepid water. How hot is that water?</p>
<p>You will find you are of two minds. Your cold hand will feel the tepid water is hot, and your hot hand will feel it is cold. And this is because the tepid water is hotter than your cold hand, and colder than your hot hand. Thus you may easily learn: what you feel as hot and cold is <em>not a measure of the world, but rather a measure of <strong>you relative to</strong> the world.</em></p>
<p>In other words, we humans are not thermometers; our nerves and brains don&#8217;t tell us the temperature of a thing, just whether it is hotter or colder than some temperature we find comfortable. <em>[In fact our nerves don&#8217;t even tell us how much hotter or colder another object is; they actually tell us something about how quickly heat is flowing out of or into our bodies from the object that we&#8217;re sensing, which is why, when you pull clothing from a hot clothes dryer, the metal zipper feels so much hotter than the cloth does. But more on that another time.]</em></p>
<p><strong>So what is temperature?</strong></p>
<p>In most ordinary situations, you can think of temperature in a simple way (though I should note that a more sophisticated view is sometimes needed.) Every material object that we find around us &#8212; tables, air, bricks, glass, alcohol &#8212; is made from <a title="Atoms: Building Blocks of Molecules" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/atoms-building-blocks-of-molecules/" target="_blank">molecules</a> characteristic of that material. In any material, the molecules, vastly too small for you and I to see, are moving, fast and randomly, and banging into each other. Some are moving faster than others, and they&#8217;re heading in all directions. In a solid, they don&#8217;t move far; they just rattle in place. In a liquid or gas, they can move all around, but they don&#8217;t go far without banging into each other, and when they collide their speed and direction change. Because they&#8217;re constantly running into each other, each molecule is moving sometimes faster, sometimes slower&#8230; but the molecules never stop moving.</p>
<p><em>[This might confuse your intuition. You&#8217;re used to large objects that you can see, like soccer balls and cardboard boxes and pens, slowing down and stopping. That&#8217;s because, on the Earth&#8217;s surface, large objects generally end up sliding over the ground or the floor, and friction slows them down. Molecules aren&#8217;t subject to friction, so they keep moving. In fact friction is a process in which large objects gradually lose their motion-energy (technically, &#8220;kinetic&#8221; energy) and hand it over to molecules!]</em></p>
<p>The temperature of an ordinary material is simply <strong><em>a measure of the average amount of random, invisible motion that the molecules in that material are undergoing</em></strong>, or, more precisely, <em><strong>a measure of the average speed and motion-energy that those molecules have. </strong> </em>Molecules in colder objects move more slowly than molecules in hotter objects; that&#8217;s all there is to temperature!</p>
<p>Here again, our senses fail us. Look at the table in front of you. Your senses do not tell you that the molecules in that table are randomly wiggling around. Of course your senses don&#8217;t even tell you that the table is made from molecules, so it&#8217;s not surprising they don&#8217;t reveal their motion&#8230; but there aren&#8217;t even apparent fuzzy edges to the table, which you might have naively expected. And our senses don&#8217;t tell us that even on a calm day, with no wind, the molecules of the air surrounding us are zipping around at a cool 1600 feet (500 meters) <em><strong>per second</strong></em> &#8212; faster than the speed of sound, and around five times the wind speeds of the most powerful hurricanes.</p>
<p>This incredible rain of molecules against your body doesn&#8217;t knock you over because, unlike hurricane wind, which pushes you in a particular direction, the random motions of the molecules push you in all directions, and therefore, in no direction at all. The molecules do exert pressure on your skin, but your body pushes back; if it didn&#8217;t it would collapse, so of course evolution has assured that it does.  Yet your senses don&#8217;t even bother to tell you that all this is happening.  Why?  Because this pressure is just part of the scenery of being alive on the surface of the Earth, and your survival doesn&#8217;t depend upon you knowing about it, anymore than it depends upon you knowing that molecules exist at all.</p>
<p><strong>How much hotter is Florida than Minnesota?</strong></p>
<p>Now that it&#8217;s clear what temperature is, we can ask how large, really, is the change from the 84ºF (29ºC) [301 K] temperature felt in daytime in southern Florida and the -40ºF (-40ºC) [233 K] temperatures felt in early morning in northern Minnesota? The temperature difference, subtracting the colder number from the hotter one, sounds dramatic, but doesn&#8217;t answer to the question. We have to focus something else.</p>
<p>For this purpose, the outdated Fahrenheit scale is hopeless. The number of degrees doesn&#8217;t correspond to anything very easy to remember. You just have to memorize how the Fahrenheit scale works: water boils at 212ºF and freezes at 32ºF, and that&#8217;s for weird historical reasons.</p>
<p>The Centigrade, or Celsius, system (Celsius invented it in 1743) is much easier to remember, and almost the whole world uses it in daily life. 0ºC is where water freezes; 100ºC is where it boils. But while that&#8217;s convenient when you want to know if the temperature is below freezing, it&#8217;s not convenient to determine the answer to our question.</p>
<p>No, if you want to understand really how much hotter is air at 84ºF (29ºC) than air at -40ºF (-40ºC), you need the Kelvin scale. The Kelvin scale is very easy to use.  For one thing, it&#8217;s really the same as the number of degrees in Centigrade/Celsius scale, <strong>plus 273.15</strong> &#8212; and that&#8217;s it. I&#8217;ll just approximate this shift by 273, to keep my numbers simple.</p>
<p>Thus water</p>
<ul>
<li>freezes at 273 K, and</li>
<li>boils at 100 + 273 = 373 K.</li>
</ul>
<p>What&#8217;s this magic number &#8220;273.15&#8221;? Well, 0 K = -273.15 ºC = -459.67 F is the temperature at which <strong>the amount of motion-energy per molecule reaches zero, and the molecules stop moving.</strong> <em>[Almost true! Due to the jitter inherent in quantum mechanics, the molecules never <strong>quite</strong> stop moving, and the motion-energy is never <strong>quite</strong> zero. But the motion and the motion-energy are far too small for us to worry about for today.]</em> In other words, it is impossible to have a lower temperature than zero Kelvin! This lowest possible temperature is called &#8220;absolute zero&#8221;, which is why the Kelvin scale starts there. 0 K simply corresponds to the lowest possible motion-energy per molecule, which for most practical purposes might as well be literally zero.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s the advantage of the Kelvin scale: <strong>the temperature of the object in Kelvin is directly proportional to the energy of its molecules.</strong> An object with a temperature of 200 K has twice as much motion-energy per molecule as one with a temperature of 100 K, and half as much motion-energy per molecule as one with a temperature of 400 K.</p>
<p>Well, that suggests to us how we should answer the question: How much hotter is object B than object A? Now that we have a scale for which all temperatures are positive, we can take a ratio of their two temperatures, T<sub>B</sub>/T<sub>A</sub>. If B is hotter than A, the ratio is greater than 1; if B is colder, the ratio is less than 1.  If that ratio is, say, 1.2 &#8212; if the temperature of B is 20% larger than the temperature of A &#8212; that tells us that the molecules in B have energy 20% larger than those in A. <strong><em>Remember this is only true if we use the Kelvin scale, and not Fahrenheit or Celsius</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the reason not to use the temperature <em>difference</em>, T<sub>B</sub> &#8211; T<sub>A</sub>, is that its meaning is ambiguous. A difference of 5 K would be very large if B is at 6 K and A at 1 K &#8212; B is six times hotter than A &#8212; but would be a tiny effect if B is at 60,000 K and A is at 59,995 K, in which case the difference in the two temperatures is a very small fraction of a percent.</p>
<p>I hope you now begin to see why scientists use the Kelvin scale. It is a scale that relates a property of <em>visible macroscopic</em> objects, as measured in <strong>temperature</strong>, to the level of activity of the <em>invisible microscopic molecules</em> out of which the objects are made, as measured in <strong>motion-energy</strong> (or &#8220;kinetic&#8221; energy). If the temperature is large, so is the energy per molecule; as one drops to zero, so does the other.</p>
<p><strong>So how cold is this week&#8217;s cold snap?</strong></p>
<p>Yesterday, in southern Florida the high temperature was 301 K, and the low temperature was 233 K in northern Minnesota. The ratio of the two temperatures is simply 301/233 = 1.29. We may say that Florida was as much as 29% hotter than Minnesota, meaning, specifically, that the average air molecule in Miami in the afternoon had 29% more energy than the average air molecule in Duluth at dawn.</p>
<p>Is that a lot, or not? Motion-energy increases as speed <strong>squared</strong> <em>(E<sub>motion </sub>= ½mv², for an object of mass m traveling at a speed v that is much slower than the speed of light)</em> so it only takes 14% more speed to give you 29% more motion-energy.  That means a car driving 68 miles per hour (114 km/hour) has 29% more motion-energy than a car driving 60 miles per hour (100 km/hour).  So think about that when you are commuting to work. <strong><em>When you accelerate from 60 to 68 miles per hour, you&#8217;ve increased your speed by enough to turn this morning&#8217;s Duluth into this afternoon&#8217;s Miami.  </em></strong></p>
<p>That said, the molecules are a bit speedier.  Compared to those slow-pokes in Duluth, which crawl along at a mere 980 miles per hour (1640 km/hour), the average molecule in Miami is traveling about 1100 miles per hour (1850 km/hour), about 14% faster.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s a matter of perspective.  Biologically speaking, the difference between Florida and Minnesota is enormous; you can survive in one for months, and in the other for minutes.  This is in large part because between comfortable Key West and dangerous Duluth lies the temperature where water turns to ice, and so your body, being more than half water, will start to freeze solid in the cold, not to mention being unable to maintain the internal warmth it needs to function.  And yet, for the nitrogen and oxygen molecules in the air, the cool-down is a rather small change&#8230; no more than slowing down on the highway from 68 miles an hour to 60 miles an hour (114 km per hour to 100 km per hour.)   They barely notice the difference!</p>
<p>We should be very grateful to live on such a stable planet, whose hottest surface temperature (about 130ºF= 54ºC = 328 K) and coldest surface temperature (about -130ºF = -90ºC = 183 K) are only different by a factor of 328/183 = 1.8 &#8212; and of course those temperatures are unusual, and only occur in unique places.  Compare that with the Moon, where high temperatures (214ºF = 101ºC = 374 K) and low temperatures (-300ºF = -184ºC = 89 K) vary by a factor of 374/89 = 4.2.  Out in the wider universe, it&#8217;s a little more drastic. The center of the sun reaches a blazing temperature of 27,000,000ºF = 15,000,000ºC = 15,000,000 K (approximately).  Meanwhile the ancient photons (the particles of electromagnetic radiation which make up the &#8220;cosmic microwave background&#8221;) that fill outer space would warm you to just under 3 K. The ratio of the two temperatures is about 5,000,000.</p>
<p>Home Sweet Home.  Even when it runs a little cold.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<pre><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong><em>For More Advanced Non-Experts</em></strong></span></pre>
<p><em>[This is part 6 of a series, which begins <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and&nbsp;Predictions" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/23/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions/">here</a>.]</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve explained in earlier posts how we can calculate many things in the quantum field theory that is known as the <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary&nbsp;Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">&#8220;Standard Model&#8221; of particle physics</a>, itself an amalgam of three, simpler quantum field theories.</p>
<p>When forces are <a title="The Strengths of the Known&nbsp;Forces" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-forces-of-nature/the-strength-of-the-known-forces/">&#8220;weak&#8221;, in the technical sense</a>, calculations can generally be done by a <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part&nbsp;3)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/01/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-3/" target="_blank">method of successive approximation (called &#8220;perturbation theory&#8221;)</a>. &nbsp;When forces are very &#8220;strong&#8221;, however, this method doesn&#8217;t work. Specifically, for processes involving the strong nuclear force, in which the distances involved are larger than a proton and the energies smaller than the mass-energy of a proton, some other method is needed. &nbsp;(See&nbsp;<a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part&nbsp;5)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/28/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-5/" target="_blank">Figure 1 of Part 5.</a>)</p>
<p>One class of methods involves <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part&nbsp;4)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/07/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-4/" target="_blank">directly simulating, using a computer, the behavior of the quantum field theory equations for the strong nuclear force</a>. More precisely, we simulate in a simplified version of the real world, the imaginary world shown in Figure 1 below, where</p>
<ul>
<li>the weak nuclear force and the electromagnetic force are turned off,</li>
<li>the electron, muon, tau, neutrinos, W, Z and Higgs particles are ignored</li>
<li>the three heavier types of quarks are also ignored</li>
</ul>
<p>(See <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part&nbsp;4)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/07/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-4/" target="_blank">Figure 4 of Part 4</a>&nbsp;for more details.) &nbsp;This makes the calculations a lot simpler. &nbsp;And their results allow us, for instance, to understand why quarks and anti-quarks and gluons form the more complex particles called hadrons, of which protons and neutrons are just a couple of examples. Unfortunately, computer simulations still are nowhere near powerful enough for the calculation of some of the most interesting processes in nature&#8230; and won&#8217;t be for a long time.</p>

<p>Another method I mentioned involves the use of&nbsp;<a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part&nbsp;5)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/28/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-5/" target="_blank">an effective quantum field theory which describes the &#8220;objects&#8221; that the original theory produces at low energy</a>. But that only works if you know what those objects are; in the real world [and the similar imaginary world of Figure 1] we know from experiment that those objects are pions and other low-mass hadrons, but generally we don&#8217;t know what they are.</p>
<p>This brings us to today&#8217;s story. &nbsp;Our success with the Standard Model might give you the impression that we basically understand quantum field theory and how to make predictions using it, with a few exceptions. But this would be far, far from the truth. As far as we can tell, much (if not most) of quantum field theory remains deeply mysterious.<span id="more-6845"></span></p>
<p>Is this merely an academic problem of no interest for the real world? That is partly a question of whether any of these poorly understood quantum field theories actually is playing a role in particle physics&#8230; which is something we may not know until we complete our study of nature many centuries hence. But at a certain level, we already know the answer is &#8220;no, it&#8217;s not academic&#8221;. Theories of a similar type <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and&nbsp;Predictions" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/23/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions/" target="_blank">have a role to play in &nbsp;&#8220;condensed matter&#8221; physics</a>, and if we understood quantum field theory thoroughly, it might allow for a number of the most difficult puzzles in that subject to be resolved.</p>
<p>To illustrate some of the issues, I&#8217;m going to give you some examples of imaginary worlds described by quantum field theories that don&#8217;t appear in the Standard Model, and tell you something of what we do and don&#8217;t know about them.</p>
<p><strong>Modifying the Strong Nuclear Force: Additional Low-Mass Quarks</strong></p>
<p>First, let&#8217;s talk about a case very similar to the imaginary world of&nbsp;Figure 1. &nbsp;The only difference is that instead of having three &#8220;flavors&#8221; of low-mass quarks &#8212; up, down and strange &#8212; imagine a world that has eight. Or seven. &nbsp;Or nine. &nbsp;What happens in such a world? &nbsp;What do the equations of the corresponding quantum field theory predict?</p>
<p><div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_6850" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/qcdnf8_fields.png"><img loading="lazy" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6850" data-attachment-id="6850" data-permalink="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/11/06/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-6/qcdnf8_fields/" data-orig-file="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/qcdnf8_fields.png" data-orig-size="1079,679" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="QCDNf8_fields" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="&lt;p&gt;Fig. 2:&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Does this imaginary world behave much like the real world, with proton-like and neutron-like objects, and pion-like objects that become massless when the quarks are massless? Or does this theory have the property that, when the quarks are massless, it is <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part&nbsp;2)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/24/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-2/" target="_blank">scale-invariant, a feature I described in the second post in this series</a>? As the quark masses are reduced to zero, does the proton mass in such a world remain substantial, or does it drop to zero too? Are there other features that are very different from the real world? Is there <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part&nbsp;5)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/28/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-5/" target="_blank">a simple effective quantum field theory</a> that describes how this world behaves at long distances and low energies?</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">We don&#8217;t know.</span></em></strong></p>
<p>We can probably figure this case out, perhaps in the next few years, using computer simulations; armed with recent advances in both computer technology and in simulation techniques,&nbsp;<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1303.7129" target="_blank">people are already trying</a>. We can certainly simulate the case where the quark masses are relatively big, and then, step by step, lower the quark masses. Each step makes the calculation harder and more unstable, but we can gain insights into what is happening as the quark masses go to zero by looking at how the theory changes &#8212; and particular, how the masses of the hadrons change &#8212; when the quark masses are gradually reduced. Some of my friends with very big computers are working hard to figure this out, but despite 15 years of effort, we still don&#8217;t have clear answers&#8230; yet.</p>
<p>More generally, we can consider similar imaginary worlds where the number of colors is any integer N &gt; 1, and where the number of types of quarks (with N colors each) is any integer Q &gt; 0. &nbsp;The equations for all these theories are similar, but their behavior can be quite different. &nbsp;For a large class of these imaginary worlds (typically those with N&gt;3 and Q between about 2N and 4N) almost nothing is known about their behavior. Except for N=2 and 3, there have been (to my knowledge) no attempts to run computer simulations. &nbsp;So an enormous amount remains unknown, though potentially knowable, at least in part.</p>
<p><strong>Modifying the Strong Nuclear Force: A Chiral Theory</strong></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another imaginary world to think about. This one has something a little different. As I <a title="The Known Particles — If The Higgs Field Were&nbsp;Zero" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/the-known-particles-if-the-higgs-field-were-zero/" target="_blank">discussed in this article</a>, quarks (as well as <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary&nbsp;Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">electrons and other matter particles in the Standard Model</a>) are really made from two half-quarks, which I named quark-right and quark-left <em>(the reason for the names is technical)</em>. So we can consider a theory that has seven quarks-left which carry color (and their anti-quarks-right that carry anti-color), and it has a single half-&#8220;sextet&#8221;-right which carries two colors (and an anti-sextet-left that carries two anti-colors.) It&#8217;s not obvious that this makes sense, but&#8230; trust me. This is called a &#8220;chiral&#8221; theory because the objects that carry color aren&#8217;t the mirror image of the things that carry anti-color.</p>

<p>The key feature of such a theory is that these half-quarks and half-sextet particles&nbsp;<em>can&#8217;t be given a mass</em>; to give a mass to a quark-left, you need a quark-right, and similarly a sextet-right needs a sextet-left. And in this world, these partners are missing. So these particles have to remain massless.</p>
<p>How does this imaginary world behave? I don&#8217;t know, and worse, <em><strong>I don&#8217;t know how to find out</strong></em>. At sufficiently low energy and long distance, successive approximation won&#8217;t work in this imaginary world, anymore than it works for the real-world&#8217;s strong nuclear force. And computers can&#8217;t be used to do calculations, because the calculational techniques currently available simply don&#8217;t work when quarks (or other spin-1/2 particles) are massless. And finally, no one knows how to guess a suitable <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part&nbsp;5)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/28/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-5/" target="_blank">effective quantum field theory to describe the long-distance and low-energy behavior</a> of this imaginary world; neither experiment nor computer simulation is available to give us a hint. It&#8217;s not even clear that an effective quantum field theory with nicely behaved equations exists at all. (We&#8217;ll see soon that there are cases where we know no such theory exists.)</p>
<p>In short, even though the equations of this quantum field theory are known and look very similar to the ones that describe the strong nuclear force in the real world, the physical phenomena that result from those equations are a mystery. &nbsp;This is not unusual. <strong><em>For the majority of quantum field theories for which the equations are known, this is the situation!</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>The Generic Situation: Theories with Unknown Equations</strong></p>
<p>And then&#8230; there are the quantum field theories for&nbsp;which we don&#8217;t even know any useful equations, or any way to characterize them by the types of fields and particles that they have. &nbsp;We know (or perhaps suspect) these quantum field theories exist, but our knowledge is indirect, and the standard types of equations used in quantum field theory don&#8217;t work for them.</p>
<p>[For some of these quantum field theories, we do know some relevant equations that could <em>in principle</em>, with careful adjustment, be used. &nbsp;But often these equations are as hard as the ones described in the previous section, for which neither computer simulation nor successive approximation can work, so <em>in practice </em>the careful adjustment can&#8217;t be done, and no calculations are possible.]<em></em><br />
<em></em></p>
<p>How, you may rightly wonder, could we possibly even <em>know</em> that there are quantum field theories for which no useful equations can currently be written down? That is a story I&#8217;ll tell soon. For today, suffice it to say that we have no idea whether this set of theories is a tiny minority of quantum field theories, or the overwhelming majority. There simply aren&#8217;t any techniques to tell us the answer. Indications are that they are very common. &nbsp; Still, without the equations, how can we hope to learn anything about them?</p>
<p>This is one place where <a title="Supersymmetry — What Is&nbsp;It?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/supersymmetry-what-is-it/" target="_blank"><strong><em>supersymmetry</em></strong></a> &#8212; not in its potentially direct real-world application, as a means by which to address <a title="Naturalness and the Standard&nbsp;Model" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/naturalness/" target="_blank">the naturalness problem of the Standard Model</a>, but rather <strong><em>as a tool for studying the properties of otherwise incomprehensible imaginary worlds</em></strong> &#8212; comes into play.</p>
<p><em>To Be Continued&#8230;</em></p>

<p>Kallosh is one of the world&#8217;s experts on black holes, <a title="Supersymmetry — What Is It?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/supersymmetry-what-is-it/" target="_blank">supersymmetry</a>,  cosmic inflation <em>(that period, still conjectural but gaining acceptance, during which the universe is suspected to have expanded at an unbelievable rapid rate)</em>, and &#8220;quantization&#8221; <em>(i.e., on how to define quantum field theories and quantum gravity theories so that they actually make mathematical sense &#8212; which is not easy to do correctly)</em>. Much of her work concerns supersymmetry and its application to quantum gravity and to superstring theory. Her technical expertise and her inventiveness are legendary, as is her friendly enthusiasm. I&#8217;ve known her since I was a graduate student; she was one of a number of famous scientists from the former Soviet Union who came to the United States around 1988-1989.  Aside from just interacting with her within Stanford&#8217;s small community of theoretical physics students, postdocs and faculty, I also attended two courses that she taught on advanced topics, one on supersymmetry and one on quantization.</p>
<p>Shenker is famous for a number of papers that significantly changed our understanding of quantum field theory, quantum gravity and string theory. His fame derives in part from his ability to extract deep insights about physics from just a few mathematical clues &#8212; often ones that only he recognizes as being clues in the first place. Shenker was a faculty member at Rutgers when I was a postdoctoral researcher there in the mid-90s. (He later moved to Stanford.)  I cannot count the profound lessons that I learned during those years from him (and the other Rutgers faculty), both at our daily group lunch, and in the lounge where several of the faculty and other postdocs would regularly gather in the mornings. And I was even fortunate enough to write<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9506182" target="_blank"> a paper (on black holes and their entropy)</a> together with him and another then-postdoc, Dan Kabat. Aside from his down-to-earth no-nonsense style, and his strong support of young people and their ideas, one thing I remember well about Shenker is that it was perilous to say anything interesting to him while walking back from lunch on a bitterly cold day. He would stop and think&#8230; and the rest of us would freeze.</p>
<p>In the wider world of the public, and especially the blogosphere, Kallosh and Shenker would probably be labelled as &#8220;string theorists.&#8221; Such terminology would be somewhat crude, for it would fail to capture the range and depth of their careers. Appropriately, the talks at the conference so far have ranged widely, including general attempts to make some sense of quantum gravity,  discussion of the information-loss problem of black holes (the so-called <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/12/12/two-days-of-polchinski-puzzles/" target="_blank">&#8220;firewall&#8221; problem</a>), unexpected subtleties in how quantum field theory works (yes, we are still learning!), new ways of thinking about the physics of electrical conductors and insulators, and advances in our understanding of cosmic inflation. And there were even a couple of talks on string theory.  (That said, <a title="Strings: History, Development, Impact" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/06/strings-history-development-impact/" target="_blank">the long shadow of string theory, and its direct and indirect influence on many other subfields</a>, can be palpably felt at this conference.  More on that subject another day.)</p>
<p>Since I&#8217;ve been so busy with <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> physics in recent years, and haven&#8217;t been following these subfields closely, it&#8217;s been a very educational conference for me.  I&#8217;ll describe some of the talks later in the week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first day of the <a title="SEARCHing for New Particles on Long Island" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/08/20/searching-for-new-particles-on-long-island/" target="_blank">SEARCH workshop</a> was focused on current and future measurements of the new <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">Higgs particle</a> discovered in 2012. A lot of the issues I&#8217;ve written about before (for instance <a title="From Moriond, Higgs Evidence Piles Up" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/03/08/from-moriond-higgs-evidence-piles-up/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a title="Taking Stock of the “Higgs” (Jan. 2013)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/taking-stock-of-the-higgs-jan-2013/" target="_blank">here</a>) and most of the updates were rather technical, so I won&#8217;t cover them today. But I thought it useful to take a look at what was said by <a title="SEARCH Workshop Panel Discussion on LHC Posted Online" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/05/04/search-workshop-panel-discussion-on-lhc-posted-online/" target="_blank">Raman Sundrum</a> and separately by Nima Arkani-Hamed, whom you&#8217;ve heard about many times (for instance, <a title="SEARCH Workshop Panel Discussion on LHC Posted Online" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/05/04/search-workshop-panel-discussion-on-lhc-posted-online/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a title="5. Supersymmetry?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/taking-stock-of-the-higgs-jan-2013/5-supersymmetry/" target="_blank">here</a>), on the subject of the <a title="The Hierarchy Problem" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/" target="_blank">hierarchy problem</a> and &#8220;naturalness&#8221;.</p>
<p>First, let me remind you of the issue. The hierarchy problem can be phrased in many ways. <a title="The Hierarchy Problem" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/" target="_blank">Here&#8217;s one</a>. Here&#8217;s another: for a <a title="The Standard Model Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/" target="_blank">Standard Model Higgs</a> (the simplest possible type of Higgs particle) to show up, without any other new particles or forces at the Large Hadron Collider, is &#8230; well, let&#8217;s say it&#8217;s completely shocking, with a caveat. Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>Because every spin-zero particle (or particle-like object) that has ever been observed, in particle physics and in similar contexts within solids and fluids, has been accompanied by new phenomena at an energy scale comparable to the scalar&#8217;s mass-energy (E=mc<sup>2</sup> energy).</li>
<li>And although we cannot calculate the mass of the Higgs particle using the Standard Model (the equations we use to predict the behavior of the known particles and forces) &#8212; the Higgs particle&#8217;s mass is something we put <strong>in</strong> to the equations, which is why we didn&#8217;t know, before the LHC, what it would be &#8212; there are many speculative theories that go beyond the Standard Model where the Higgs particle&#8217;s mass <em>can</em> be computed, or at least estimated. And in all of these cases, the Higgs particle is accompanied by other particles and forces that show up at scales comparable to the Higgs particle&#8217;s mass-energy.</li>
</ul>
<p>This fact &#8212; that spin-zero particles like the Higgs are accompanied by other particles and forces at a similar energy range &#8212; isn&#8217;t a mystery. Particle physicists (and others who use quantum field theory, the type of math used in the Standard Model) understand <em>why</em> this should be true, and have for several decades. The jargon is that it is &#8220;<strong>natural</strong>&#8221; (not meaning &#8220;from nature&#8221;, but rather meaning &#8220;generically true&#8221;) for spin-zero particles to have other particles and forces around at comparable energy scales. (I&#8217;ll explain the argument another time.)</p>
<p>So to discover the Higgs particle at a mass-energy of 125 GeV, and no other new particles or phenomena below, say, 1000-2000 GeV or so, would fly in the face of what we&#8217;ve seen again and again in physics, both in past data and in calculations within speculative theories. In this sense, <em>finding nothing except a Standard Model Higgs at the LHC would be shocking</em>. (I say &#8220;would be&#8221; rather than &#8220;is&#8221; because the LHC is still young, and no overarching conclusions can yet be drawn from its current data.)</p>
<p>But &#8212; here&#8217;s the caveat &#8212; how bad is this shock? After all, <em>somewhat</em> surprising things do happen in nature all the time. Only astonishingly, <em>spectacularly</em> surprising things are very rare. Yes, it would be a very big shock if new particles and forces associated with the Higgs have a mass-energy a trillion trillion times higher than that of the Higgs. But what if they&#8217;re just a <em>few</em> times higher than would be natural, let&#8217;s say at 10,000 GeV &#8212; which would be out of reach of the LHC? Maybe that is a small enough shock that we shouldn&#8217;t pay it much attention.  Unfortunately, this is a judgment call; there&#8217;s no sharp answer to this question.</p>

<p>As Sundrum put it, there are (crudely) three logically distinct possibilities for what lies ahead:</p>
<ul>
<li>No shock: The hierarchy problem is resolved naturally; the associated new particles will soon be seen at the LHC.</li>
<li>Mild shock: The hierarchy problem is resolved in a <em>roughly</em> natural way; most of the associated new particles will be a bit beyond the reach of the LHC, but perhaps one or more will be lightweight enough to be discovered during the lifetime of the LHC.</li>
<li>Severe shock: The hierarchy problem is not resolved naturally; any associated particles may lie far out of reach, though of course other particles (associated, say, with dark matter) might still show up at the LHC.</li>
</ul>
<p>Arkani-Hamed made a similar distinction, but addressed the third case in more detail, breaking it up into two sub-cases.</p>
<ul>
<li>The solution to the hierarchy problem is that it results from a <em>bias (= selection effect = a form of the &#8220;anthropic principle&#8221;) </em>; the universe is huge, complex and diverse, with particles and forces that differ from place to place [sometimes called a &#8220;multiverse&#8221;], and most of that universe is inhospitable to life of any sort; the reason we live in an unusual part of that universe, with a lightweight unaccompanied scalar particle, is because this happens to be the only place (or one of very few places) that life could have evolved. A key test of this argument is to show that if the particles and forces of nature were much different from what we find them in our part of the universe, then our environment would become completely inhospitable &#8212; perhaps there would be no atoms, or no stars. It is controversial whether this test has been passed; good arguments can be made on both sides.</li>
<li>The solution to the hierarchy problem involves <em>a completely novel mechanism</em>.   Easy to say &#8212; but got any ideas?  Arkani-Hamed gave us two examples of mechanisms which he had studied that he couldn&#8217;t make work &#8212; but perhaps someone else can do better.  One is based on trying to apply notions related to <a href="http://www.nld.ds.mpg.de/~soc/examples.php" target="_blank">self-organized criticality</a>, but he was never able to make much progress.  Another is based on <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep--th/9506101.pdf" target="_blank">an idea of Ed Witten&#8217;s</a> that perhaps our world is best understood as one that
<ol>
<li>has two dimensions of space (not the obvious three)</li>
<li>is <a title="Supersymmetry — What Is It?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/supersymmetry-what-is-it/" target="_blank">supersymmetric</a> (which seems impossible, but in three dimensions supersymmetry and gravity together imply that particles and their superpartner particles need not have equal masses)</li>
<li>has extremely <a title="What is the “Strength” of a Force?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/05/31/what-is-the-strength-of-a-force/" target="_blank">strong forces</a></li>
</ol>
<p>All of this seems completely contradictory with what we observe in our world. But! One of the important conceptual lessons from string theory <em>[this is yet another example of something important that would not have been learned if people hadn&#8217;t actually been studying string theory]</em> is that when forces become very strong, making the physics extremely complicated to describe, it is possible that a better description of that world becomes available &#8212; and that in some special cases, this better description has <em>one additional dimension of space</em> and <em>weaker forces</em>. In short, Witten&#8217;s idea is that our way of understanding our world, with three spatial dimensions, no apparent superymmetry and no extremely strong forces, might actually be simply an alternative and simpler description of a supersymmetric world with only two spatial dimensions with an extremely strong force. Arkani-Hamed, trying to apply this to the hierarchy problem, noticed this idea makes a prediction, but he showed that the prediction is false in the Standard Model, and it seems impossible to add any collection of particles that would make it true.</p>
