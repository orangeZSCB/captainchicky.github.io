										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s additional news from LIGO (the Laser Interferometry Gravitational Observatory) about gravitational waves today. What was <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2016/02/11/advance-thoughts-on-ligo/">a giant discovery just a few months ago</a> will soon become almost routine&#8230; but for now it is still very exciting&#8230;</p>
<p>LIGO got a Christmas (US) present: Dec 25th/26th 2015, two more black holes were detected coalescing 1.4 billion light years away &#8212; changing the length of LIGO&#8217;s arms by 300 parts in a trillion trillion, even less than the first merger observed in September. The black holes had 14 solar masses and 8 solar masses, and merged into a black hole with 21 solar masses, emitting 1 solar mass of energy in gravitational waves. In contrast to the September event, which was short and showed just a few orbits before the merger, in this event nearly 30 orbits over a full second are observed, making more information available to scientists about the black holes, the merger, and general relativity.  (Apparently one of the incoming black holes was spinning with at least 20% of the maximum possible rotation rate for a black hole.)</p>
<p>The signal is not so &#8220;bright&#8221; as the first one, so it cannot be seen by eye if you just look at the data; to find it, some clever mathematical techniques are needed. But the signal, after signal processing, is very clear. (Signal-to-noise ratio is 13; it was 24 for the September detection.) For such a clear signal to occur due to random noise is 5 standard deviations &#8212; officially a detection. The corresponding &#8220;chirp&#8221; is nowhere near so obvious, but there is a faint trace.</p>
<p>This gives two detections of black hole mergers over about 48 days of 2015 quality data. There&#8217;s also a third &#8220;candidate&#8221;, not so clear &#8212; signal-to-noise of just under 10. If it is really due to gravitational waves, it would be merging black holes again&#8230; midway in size between the September and December events&#8230; but it is borderline, and might just be a statistical fluke.</p>
<p>It is interesting that we already have two, maybe three, mergers of large black holes&#8230; and no mergers of neutron stars with black holes or with each other, which are harder to observe. It seems there really are a lot of big black holes in binary pairs out there in the universe. Incidentally, the question of whether they might form the dark matter of the universe has been raised; it&#8217;s still a long-shot idea, since there are arguments against it for black holes of this size, but seeing these merger rates one has to reconsider those arguments carefully and keep an open mind about the evidence.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s remember also that advanced-LIGO is still not running at full capacity. When LIGO starts its next run, six months long starting in September, the improvements over last year&#8217;s run will probably give a 50% to 100% increase in the rate for observed mergers.   In the longer run, the possibility of one merger per week is possible.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, VIRGO in Italy will come on line soon too, early in 2017. Japan and India are getting into the game too over the coming years. More detectors will allow scientists to know where on the sky the merger took place, which then can allow normal telescopes to look for flashes of light (or other forms of electromagnetic radiation) that might occur simultaneously with the merger&#8230; as is expected for neutron star mergers but not widely expected for black hole mergers.  The era of gravitational wave astronomy is underway.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In the long and careful process of restarting the Large Hadron Collider [LHC] after its two-year nap for upgrades and repairs, another milestone has been reached: protons have once again collided inside the LHC&#8217;s experimental detectors (named ATLAS, CMS, LHCb and &#8230; <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2015/05/06/lhc-starts-collisions-and-a-radio-interview-tonight/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the long and careful process of restarting the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC] after its two-year nap for upgrades and repairs, another milestone has been reached: <a href="http://home.web.cern.ch/about/updates/2015/05/low-energy-collisions-tune-lhc-experiments">protons have once again collided inside the LHC&#8217;s experimental detectors</a> (named ATLAS, CMS, LHCb and ALICE). This is good news, but don&#8217;t get excited yet. It&#8217;s just one small step. These are collisions at the lowest energy at which the LHC operates (450 GeV per proton, to be compared with the 4000 GeV per proton in 2012 and the 6500 GeV per proton they&#8217;ve already achieved in the last month, though in non-colliding beams.) Also the number of protons in the beams, and the number of collisions per second, is still very, very small compared to what will be needed. So discoveries are not imminent!  Yesterday&#8217;s milestone was just one of the many little tests that are made to assure that the LHC is properly set up and ready for the first full-energy collisions, which should start in about a month.</p>
<p>But since full-energy collisions are on the horizon, why not listen to a radio show about what the LHC will be doing after its restart is complete? Today (Wednesday May 6th), <a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/virtually-speaking-science">Virtually Speaking Science</a>, on which I have appeared a couple of times before, will run a program at 5 pm Pacific time (8 pm Eastern). Science writer Alan Boyle will be interviewing me about the LHC&#8217;s plans for the next few months and the coming years. You can listen live, or listen later once they post it.  <a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/virtually-speaking-science/2015/05/07/alan-boyle-matt-strassler-large-hadron-collider">Here&#8217;s the link for the program.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As promised in <a title="Dark Matter: How Could the Large Hadron Collider Discover It?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2015/04/13/dark-matter-how-could-the-large-hadron-collider-discover-it/">my last post</a>, I&#8217;ve now written the answer to the second of the three questions I posed about how the Large Hadron Collider [LHC] can search for dark matter.  <a title="Searching for Dark Matter at the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/dark-matter/searching-for-dark-matter-at-the-lhc/">You can read the answers to the first two questions here</a>. The first question was about how scientists can possibly look for something that passes through a detector without leaving any trace!  The second question is how scientists can tell the difference between ordinary production of neutrinos &#8212; which also leave no trace &#8212; and production of something else. [The answer to the third question &#8212; how one could determine this &#8220;something else&#8221; really <strong>is</strong> what makes up dark matter &#8212; will be added to the article later this week.]</p>
<p>In the meantime, after Monday&#8217;s post, I got a number of interesting questions about dark matter, why most experts are confident it exists, etc.  There are many reasons to be confident; it&#8217;s not just one argument, but a set of interlocking arguments.  One of the most powerful comes from simulations of the universe&#8217;s history.  These simulations</p>
<ul>
<li>start with what we think <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/26/which-parts-of-the-big-bang-theory-are-reliable/">we know about the early universe from the cosmic microwave background</a> [CMB], including the amount of ordinary and dark matter inferred from the CMB (assuming Einstein&#8217;s gravity theory is right), and also including the degree of non-uniformity of the local temperature and density;</li>
<li>and use equations for known physics, including Einstein&#8217;s gravity, the behavior of gas and dust when compressed and heated, the effects of various forms of electromagnetic radiation on matter, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>The output of the these simulations is a prediction for the universe today &#8212; and indeed, it roughly has the properties of the one we inhabit.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.illustris-project.org/movies/illustris_movie_cube_sub_frame.mp4">a video from the Illustris collaboration</a>, which has done the most detailed simulation of the universe so far.  Note the age of the universe listed at the bottom as the video proceeds.  On the left side of the video you see dark matter.  It quickly clumps under the force of gravity, forming a wispy, filamentary structure with dense knots, which then becomes rather stable; moderately dense regions are blue, highly dense regions are pink.  On the right side is shown gas.  You see that <strong><em>after the dark matter structure begins to form</em></strong>, that structure attracts gas, also through gravity, which then forms galaxies (blue knots) around the dense knots of dark matter.  The galaxies then form black holes with energetic disks and jets, and stars, many of which explode.   These much more complicated astrophysical effects blow clouds of heated gas (red) into intergalactic space.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the distribution of galaxies in the real universe, as measured by astronomers, is illustrated <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08LBltePDZw">in this video</a> from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.   You can see by eye that the galaxies in our universe show a filamentary structure, with big nearly-empty spaces, and loose strings of galaxies ending in big clusters.  That&#8217;s consistent with what is seen in the Illustris simulation.</p>
<p>Now if you&#8217;d like to drop the dark matter idea, the question you have to ask is this: could the simulations still give a universe similar to ours <strong><em>if you took dark matter out and instead modified Einstein&#8217;s gravity somehow</em></strong>?  [Usually this type of change goes under the name of MOND.]</p>
<p>In the simulation, gravity causes the dark matter, which is &#8220;cold&#8221; (cosmo-speak for &#8220;made from objects traveling much slower than light speed&#8221;), to form filamentary structures that then serve as the seeds for gas to clump and form galaxies.  So if you want to take the dark matter out, and instead change gravity to explain other features that are normally explained by dark matter, you have a challenge.   <em>You are in danger of not creating the filamentary structure seen in our universe.</em>  Somehow your change in the equations for gravity has to cause the gas to form galaxies along filaments, and do so in the time allotted.  Otherwise it won&#8217;t lead to the type of universe that we actually live in.</p>
<p>Challenging, yes.  Challenging is not the same as impossible. But everyone one should understand that the arguments in favor of dark matter are by no means limited to the questions of how stars move in galaxies and how galaxies move in galaxy clusters.  Any implementation of MOND has to explain a lot of other things that, in most experts&#8217; eyes, are efficiently taken care of by cold dark matter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Dark Matter</strong>. Its existence is still not 100% certain, but if it exists, it is exceedingly dark, both in the usual sense &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t emit light or reflect light or scatter light &#8212; and in a more general sense &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t interact much, in <strong>any</strong> way, with ordinary stuff, like tables or floors or planets or  humans. So not only is it invisible (air is too, after all, so that&#8217;s not so remarkable), it&#8217;s actually extremely difficult to detect, even with the best scientific instruments. How difficult? We don&#8217;t even know, but certainly more difficult than <a title="How One Detects Neutrinos" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/how-one-detects-neutrinos/">neutrinos</a>, the most elusive of <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/">the known particles</a>. The only way we&#8217;ve been able to detect dark matter so far is through the pull it exerts via gravity, which is big only because there&#8217;s so much dark matter out there, and because it has slow but inexorable and remarkable effects on things that we <strong>can</strong> see, such as stars, interstellar gas, and even light itself.</p>
<p>About a week ago, the mainstream press was reporting, inaccurately, that the leading aim of the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC], after its two-year upgrade, is to discover dark matter.<em> [By the way, <a href="http://home.web.cern.ch/about/updates/2015/04/first-successful-beam-record-energy-65-tev">on Friday</a> the LHC operators made the first beams with energy-per-proton of 6.5 <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/">TeV</a>, a new record and a major milestone in the LHC&#8217;s restart.]</em>  There are many problems with such a statement, as I commented in <a title="The LHC restarts — in a manner of speaking —" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2015/04/06/the-lhc-restarts-in-a-manner-of-speaking/">my last post</a>, but let&#8217;s leave all that aside today&#8230; because it <strong><em>is</em></strong> true that the LHC can look for dark matter.   How?</p>
<p>When people suggest that the LHC can discover dark matter, they are implicitly assuming</p>
<ul>
<li>that dark matter exists (very likely, but perhaps still with some loopholes),</li>
<li>that dark matter is made from particles (which isn&#8217;t established yet) and</li>
<li>that dark matter particles can be commonly produced by the LHC&#8217;s proton-proton collisions (which need not be the case).</li>
</ul>
<p>You can question these assumptions, but let&#8217;s accept them for now.  The question for today is this: since dark matter barely interacts with ordinary matter, how can scientists at an LHC experiment like ATLAS or CMS, which is made from ordinary matter of course, have any hope of <em><strong>figuring out that they&#8217;ve made dark matter particles?</strong></em>  What would have to happen before we could see a BBC or New York Times headline that reads, &#8220;Large Hadron Collider Scientists Claim Discovery of Dark Matter&#8221;?</p>
<p>Well, to address this issue, I&#8217;m writing an article in three stages. Each stage answers one of the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>How can scientists working at ATLAS or CMS be confident that an LHC proton-proton collision has <em><strong>produced an undetected particle</strong></em> &#8212; whether this be simply a neutrino or something unfamiliar?</li>
<li>How can ATLAS or CMS scientists tell whether they are <strong><em>making something new and Nobel-Prizeworthy</em></strong>, such as dark matter particles, as opposed to making neutrinos, which they do every day, many times a second?</li>
<li>How can we be sure, if ATLAS or CMS discovers they are making undetected particles through a new and unknown process, that they are actually <strong><em>making dark matter particles</em></strong>?</li>
</ol>
<p>My answer to the first question is finished; <a title="Searching for Dark Matter at the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/dark-matter/searching-for-dark-matter-at-the-lhc/">you can read it now</a> if you like.  The second and third answers will be posted later during the week.</p>
<p>But if you&#8217;re impatient, here are highly compressed versions of the answers, in a form which is accurate, but admittedly not very clear or precise.</p>
<ol>
<li>Dark matter particles, like neutrinos, would not be observed directly. Instead their presence would be <strong>indirectly inferred</strong>, by observing the behavior of other particles that are produced alongside them.</li>
<li>It is impossible to directly distinguish dark matter particles from neutrinos or from any other new, equally undetectable particle. But the equations used to describe the <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/">known elementary particles</a> (the &#8220;Standard Model&#8221;) predict how often neutrinos are produced at the LHC. If the number of neutrino-like objects is larger that the predictions, that will mean <strong>something new is being produced</strong>.</li>
<li>To confirm that dark matter is made from LHC&#8217;s new undetectable particles will require many steps and possibly many decades. Detailed study of LHC data can allow properties of the new particles to be inferred. Then,<strong> if other types of experiments </strong>(e.g. <a title="Breaking News: Two Great New Measurements" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/30/breaking-news-two-great-new-measurements/">LUX</a> or <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/31/questions-and-answers-about-dark-matter-post-lux/">COGENT</a> or <a title="Dark Matter: Unseen, But Yet Again in the Limelight" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/04/20/dark-matter-now-you-see-it-now-you-dont/">Fermi</a>)<strong> detect dark matter itself, they can check whether it shares the same properties as LHC&#8217;s new particles</strong>. <em>Only then</em> can we know if LHC discovered dark matter.</li>
</ol>
<p>I realize these brief answers are cryptic at best, so if you want to learn more, please check out <a title="Searching for Dark Matter at the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/dark-matter/searching-for-dark-matter-at-the-lhc/">my new article</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As many of you will have already read, the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC], located at the CERN laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland, has &#8220;restarted&#8221;. Well, a restart of such a machine, after two years of upgrades, is not a simple matter, and perhaps we should say that the LHC has &#8220;begun to restart&#8221;. The process of bringing the machine up to speed begins with one weak beam of protons at a time &#8212; with no collisions, and with energy per proton at less than 15% of where the beams were back in 2012. That&#8217;s all that has happened so far.</p>
<p>If that all checks out, then the LHC operators will start trying to accelerate a beam to higher energy &#8212; eventually to record energy, 40% more than in 2012, when the LHC last was operating.  This is the real test of the upgrade; the thousands of magnets all have to work perfectly. If that all checks out, then two beams will be put in at the same time, one going clockwise and the other counterclockwise. Only then, if that all works, will the beams be made to collide &#8212; and the first few collisions of protons will result. After that, the number of collisions per second will increase, gradually. If everything continues to work, we could see the number of collisions become large enough &#8212; approaching 1 billion per second &#8212; to be scientifically interesting within a couple of months. I would not expect important scientific results before late summer, at the earliest.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t to say that the current milestone isn&#8217;t important. There could easily have been (and there almost were) magnet problems that could have delayed this event by a couple of months. But delays could also occur over the coming weeks&#8230; so let&#8217;s not expect too much in 2015. Still, the good news is that once the machine gets rolling, be it in May, June, July or beyond, we have three to four years of data ahead of us, which will offer us many new opportunities for discoveries, anticipated and otherwise.</p>
<p>One thing I find interesting and odd is that many of the news articles reported that <strong>finding dark matter</strong> is the main goal of the newly upgraded LHC. If this is truly the case, then I, and most theoretical physicists I know, didn&#8217;t get the memo. After all,</p>
<ul>
<li>dark matter could easily be of a form that the LHC <em><strong>cannot</strong></em> produce, <em>(for example, axions, or particles that interact only gravitationally, or non-particle-like objects)</em></li>
<li>and even if the LHC finds signs of something that behaves like dark matter (i.e. something that, like neutrinos, cannot be directly detected by LHC&#8217;s experiments), it will be <em>impossible</em> for the LHC to prove that it actually <em>is</em> dark matter.  Proof will require input from other experiments, and could take decades to obtain.</li>
</ul>
<p>What&#8217;s my own understanding of LHC&#8217;s current purpose? Well, based on 25 years of particle physics research and ten years working almost full time on LHC physics, I would say (and I do say, in my public talks) that the coming several-year run of the LHC is for the purpose of</p>
<ol>
<li>studying the newly discovered <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/">Higgs particle</a> in great detail, checking its properties very carefully against the predictions of the &#8220;Standard Model&#8221; <em>(the equations that describe <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/">the known apparently-elementary particles and forces</a>) </em> to see whether our current understanding of the <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/">Higgs field</a> is complete and correct, and</li>
<li>trying to find particles or other phenomena that might resolve the <a title="Naturalness and the Standard Model" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/naturalness/">naturalness puzzle</a> of the Standard Model, a puzzle which makes many particle physicists suspicious that we are missing an important part of the story, and</li>
<li>seeking <em><strong>either</strong></em> dark matter particles <em><strong>or</strong> particles that may be shown someday to be &#8220;associated&#8221; with dark matter.</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Finding dark matter <em>itself</em> is a worthy goal, but the LHC may simply not be the right machine for the job, and certainly can&#8217;t do the job alone.</p>
<p>Why the discrepancy between these two views of LHC&#8217;s purpose? One possibility is that since <em><strong>everybody</strong></em> has heard of <strong>dark matter</strong>, the goal of finding it is easier for scientists to explain to journalists, even though it&#8217;s not central.  And in turn, it is easier for journalists to explain this goal to readers who don&#8217;t care to know the real situation.  By the time the story goes to press, all the modifiers and nuances uttered by the scientists are gone, and all that remains is &#8220;LHC looking for dark matter&#8221;.  Well, stay tuned to this blog, and you&#8217;ll get a much more accurate story.</p>
<p>Fortunately <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-32106990">a much more balanced story did appear in the BBC, due to Pallab Ghosh</a>&#8230;, though as usual in Europe, with rather too much supersymmetry and not enough of other approaches to the naturalness problem.   Ghosh also does mention what I described in the italicized part of point 3 above &#8212; the possibility of what he calls the &#8220;wonderfully evocatively named `dark sector&#8217; &#8221;.  <em>[Mr. Ghosh: back in 2006, well before these ideas were popular, Kathryn Zurek and I named this a &#8220;hidden valley&#8221;, potentially relevant either for dark matter or the naturalness problem. We like to think this is a much more evocative name.]</em>  A dark sector/hidden valley would involve <em>several</em> types of particles that interact with one another, but interact hardly at all with anything that we and our surroundings are made from.  Typically, one of these types of particles could make up dark matter, but the others would unsuitable for making dark matter.  So why are these others important?  <strong><em>Because if they are produced at the LHC, they may <a title="Most Particles Decay — But Why?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/why-do-particles-decay/most-particles-decay-why/">decay</a> in a fashion that is easy to observe</em></strong> &#8212; easier than dark matter itself, which simply exits the LHC experiments without a trace, and can only be inferred from something recoiling against it.   In other words, if such a dark sector [or more generally, a hidden valley of any type] exists, the best targets for LHC&#8217;s experiments (and other experiments, such as <a href="http://hallaweb.jlab.org/experiment/APEX/">APEX</a> or <a href="http://ship.web.cern.ch/ship/">SHiP</a>) are often not the <a title="Most Particles Decay — Yet Some Don’t!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/why-do-particles-decay/most-particles-decay-yet-some-dont/">stable</a> particles that could form dark matter but their unstable friends and associates.</p>
<p>But this will all be irrelevant if the collider doesn&#8217;t work, so&#8230; first things first.  Let&#8217;s all wish the accelerator physicists success as they gradually bring the newly powerful LHC back into full operation, at a record energy per collision and eventually a record collision rate.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week I attended the <a href="http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/events/2014/sackler/" target="_blank">Eighth Harvard-Smithsonian Conference on Theoretical Astrophysics, entitled &#8220;Debates on the Nature of Dark Matter&#8221;</a>, which brought together leading figures in astronomy, astrophysics, cosmology and particle physics. Although there wasn&#8217;t much that was particularly new, it was a very useful conference for taking stock of where we are. I thought I&#8217;d bring you a few selected highlights that particularly caught my eye.<span id="more-7668"></span></p>
<p><strong>Does Dark Matter Exist, and In What Form?</strong></p>
<p>First, the question of whether dark matter even exists was nicely explored by Stacy McGaugh, from the University of Maryland, who gave a talk on the possibility that the laws of gravitation and/or motion are altered, along the lines suggested by Mordechai Milgrom. The theoretical approach of Milgrom is usually called &#8220;MOND&#8221;: MOdified Newtonian Dynamics; it involves an <em>ad hoc</em> change in the laws of motion when objects exceed a certain rate of acceleration. McGaugh, who is an astronomer, gave a careful illustration of how MOND à la Milgrom explains some odd features of galaxies. This involves careful examination of how stars rotate around the centers of galaxies of all sizes, from the very large to the very small. He emphasized that the hypothesis that galaxies are made mostly of dark matter, and embedded within a large clump of the stuff, does not easily explain these features (though interestingly professor Alyson Brooks of Rutgers University mentioned that her simulations of galaxy formation, which <em>assume</em> the presence of dark matter, do actually reproduce one of these features.) He also showed that, by contrast, MOND doesn&#8217;t do well at all with certain cosmological data, especially in properties of the cosmic microwave background. It was nice to see the evidence for and against MOND laid out in a single, well-delivered talk; it&#8217;s important to look at this question in an even-handed way, so that both the weaknesses and strengths of the dark matter hypothesis are clear.</p>
<p>But in his Wednesday evening talk, the famous astrophysicist and cosmologist Jim Peebles pointed out just how broad is the cosmological evidence for dark matter, from a wide variety of independent sources. He views the basic notion of dark matter as an idea that is not just widely accepted, but has been established by data. But he also suggested, alluding to the many puzzles about galaxies (some of which were mentioned in McGaugh&#8217;s talk) that we should view our understanding of galaxies and how they form and evolve as still quite poor, with room for significant surprises.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, not that much time was spent during the conference on the possibility that dark matter is in the form of waves in a type of field called an axion. And almost nothing was said about the possibility that dark matter is made from other types of objects, such as primordial black holes.  But I guess one can&#8217;t cover everything in a 3½ day conference&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>So Many Hints, So Little Time</strong></p>
<p>A lot of the presentations, discussion and debate concerned the hints of dark matter that have been coming and going like clouds on a windy day.</p>
<p>Anyone who still believes, after the limits from XENON100 and <a title="Breaking News: Two Great New Measurements" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/30/breaking-news-two-great-new-measurements/" target="_blank">the devastating blow from LUX</a>, that the <a title="Current Hints of Dark Matter (4/13)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/dark-matter/current-hints-of-dark-matter-413/" target="_blank">hints of dark matter seen by DAMA/LIBRA, COGENT, CDMS, CRESST</a>, etc. might be due to something real now also has to confront the non-observation of any such hint by Super-CDMS &#8212; an upgrade of the CDMS detector.  While not as powerful as LUX for large-mass particles, Super-CDMS is both more powerful and more robust for detecting dark-matter particles with masses in the 2 &#8211; 10 GeV range.  LUX and XENON100, which use liquid xenon as a target, are very different in their technology from the experiments that see hints.  These all use solid targets made mostly from smaller atomic nuclei than xenon, and this could allow one to dream that dark matter is of a sort that would show up in experiments such as DAMA more easily than in xenon-based experiments. But Super-CDMS uses a germanium target, and germanium nuclei are quite a bit lighter than xenon nuclei; so this argument is no longer so persuasive.  Yes, it is still perhaps possible to imagine dark matter that would give hints at DAMA/LIBRA or COGENT and escape both the xenon experiments and Super-CDMS; but it is looking increasingly contrived.</p>
<div style="width: 566px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/2602b-plotsupercdms.png?w=556&#038;h=445" alt="" width="556" height="445" border="0" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Result from super-CDMS from late February, shown at Dark Matter 2014. Plot shows dark matter scattering rate versus the dark matter particle&#8217;s mass; all regions above the solid and dashed lines are ruled out, according to the experiment labeling the line. Hints of dark matter are shown in the orange, blue, pink and yellow regions. (The green regions can be ignored by non-experts.)  All of the hints are ruled out by both LUX and Super-CDMS (marked &#8220;This result&#8221;). Explanations for the hints that evade both LUX and Super-CDMS are not easy to come by.</p></div>
<p>Meanwhile, the possibility of dark matter annihilating in the center of the galaxy and resulting in unexpected numbers of positrons is suggested by an unexpected number of positrons, relative to electrons, at energies of 10 &#8211; 300 GeV. This effect was first noticed by the PAMELA experiment, and then confirmed by FERMI, after which it was <a title="AMS Presents Some First Results on Cosmic Rays and Dark Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/04/03/ams-presents-some-first-results/">carefully measured by AMS</a>. But is this effect from dark matter, from pulsars <em>[for a definition, see below]</em>, from <a title="Supernovas and Neutrino Speeds" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/neutrinos-faster-than-light/opera-some-arguments-against/supernovas-and-neutrino-speeds/" target="_blank">supernova</a> remnants, or just simply from cosmic rays? There were three very different talks on this question, with very different viewpoints.  Personally, I wouldn&#8217;t bet on dark matter here&#8230;</p>
<p>Yet another hint of dark matter &#8212; an excess of photons of energy of about 130 <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/" target="_blank">GeV</a> or so from the center of the galaxy, seen in the data from the Fermi satellite &#8212; appears to be going away, despite having reached 5 standard deviations of significance by someone&#8217;s measure. Among those saying so is Christoph Weniger, the researcher who <a title="Dark Matter: Now You See It, Now You Don’t" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/04/20/dark-matter-now-you-see-it-now-you-dont/" target="_blank">first identified this excess a couple of years ago</a>. It isn&#8217;t clear yet whether the excess was a statistical fluke or a detector problem &#8212; the significance of the signal has gone down <em>both</em> because of a reanalysis by Fermi of their data <em>and</em> because there have been no events at 130 GeV for many months. Either way, it seems to be gradually disappearing as more data is collected, and while its cause may become clear in a few years, all we can say for now is &#8220;R.I.P&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>Hint Du Jour Number 1</strong></p>
<p>But two other hints of dark matter are alive and &#8230; well, not dead yet. The first involves an excess of photons (i.e., more photons are observed than expected) in the 1 &#8211; 10 GeV range, originating from a region of the galaxy that extends outward a very substantial distance from the center of the galaxy. These photons, first identified by Goodenough and Hooper <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.2998" target="_blank">here</a>, and most recently explored <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.6703" target="_blank">here</a>, may be a signal of dark matter particles annihilating. <em>(Specifically, when they <a title="Particle/Anti-Particle Annihilation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/particleanti-particle-annihilation/" target="_blank">annihilate</a> they may produce a quark and an antiquark, which in the end produce multiple <a title="What’s a Hadron?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-hadron-as-in-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">hadrons</a>, some of which can <a title="Most Particles Decay — But Why?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/why-do-particles-decay/most-particles-decay-why/" target="_blank">decay</a> to photons.)</em></p>
<p>However, these photons might also be due to something astrophysical. So far, the only known astrophysical candidate is a horde of millisecond <a href="http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/pulsars.html" target="_blank">pulsars</a>. What are those? A neutron star is a giant balls of <a title="The Nuclei of Atoms: At the Heart of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-nuclei-of-atoms-at-the-heart-of-matter/" target="_blank">neutrons</a>, about 20 kilometers across, that is a remnant from a <a title="Supernovas and Neutrino Speeds" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/neutrinos-faster-than-light/opera-some-arguments-against/supernovas-and-neutrino-speeds/" target="_blank">Type II supernova</a> explosion.  A pulsar is a neutron star that has a strong magnetic field and sends beams of electromagnetic radiation into space as it spins; since these beams are only detectable to us when they point in our direction, we see them as pulsing, hence the name &#8220;pulsar&#8221;.  A millisecond pulsar spins 1000 times a second or so (wow!).  These objects can emit very-high-energy photons, as energetic as a few GeV, out into space.</p>
<p>The excess of photons have an energy dependence that looks a bit different from pulsars, but the peak of the distribution occurs at about 2 GeV and drops off around 10 GeV, which is just what pulsar photons would be expected to do.  That makes one immediately suspicious that pulsars are responsible.  That said, the wide distribution in space of these unseen pulsars, and the number of pulsars required, are perhaps surprising.  But pulsar experts tell me that so little is known about pulsars in that region that it would be hard to argue strongly against that possibility.</p>
<p>How can the two possibilities (pulsars vs. dark matter) be distinguished? If this same signal is seen in the dwarf galaxies that surround our galaxy, which should have very few stars but lots of dark matter, it might convince us that the signal is from dark matter and not from pulsars. Conversely, if it isn&#8217;t seen, it is more likely from pulsars.  Maybe.  Well, this hint isn&#8217;t likely to go away soon, nor is it likely to be diagnosed convincingly anytime soon, so we&#8217;ll hear more about it in future.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">The Hint Du Jour Number 2</span></p>
<p>The second hint is from an excess of X-rays with an energy of just about 3500 <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/" target="_blank">eV</a>; these have been identified in various galaxies and clusters of galaxies. <em>(I wrote <a title="X-Rays From Dark Matter? A Little Hint For You To Enjoy" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/02/18/x-rays-from-dark-matter-a-little-hint-for-you-to-enjoy/" target="_blank">an incomplete article about it here</a>; I still owe you a better one.)</em> These X-rays are most popularly suggested to be from dark matter in the form of decaying sterile neutrinos (i.e. neutrino-like particles that are affected by none of the known non-gravitational forces, unlike <a title="How One Detects Neutrinos" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/how-one-detects-neutrinos/" target="_blank">ordinary neutrinos</a> which are affected by the weak nuclear force.) However, as I emphasized to you from the beginning, the same signal could also arise from other types of dark matter. For example, if dark matter particles are, like atoms, able to be &#8220;excited&#8221; (i.e. able to absorb energy and become slightly heavier but unstable versions of themselves), then when two dark matter particles bump into one another, one might become excited, and later decay back to its original state while emitting an X-ray photon.</p>
<p>Alternatively, perhaps this excess is due to an unknown atomic effect, and has nothing to do with dark matter at all.  Again, seeing this excess in dwarf galaxies would be potentially crucial in deciding the issue.   Compared to galaxies the size of the Milky Way, dwarf galaxies have much more dark matter than hot gas, so these X-rays would be seen there only if they are due to dark matter, and not due to atomic physics.</p>
<p>Since either or both of these hints du jour might have to do with astrophysics, not dark matter, we are, yet again, in a waiting game &#8212; waiting for more data, and more convincing data, that might allow one or both of these sources of photons to be fully explained.</p>
<p><strong>Looking for Dark Matter In New Ways</strong></p>
<p>Finally, one of the most interesting things I learned at the conference was explained by professor Rouven Essig of Stony Brook University. He and his team has been working on the problem of detecting dark matter particles much lighter than those that XENON and LUX and Super-CDMS are designed to detect &#8212; as much as 100 to 1000 times lighter. XENON-, LUX-, COGENT- and CMDS-type experiments are best at detecting particles with mass of 5 &#8211; 1000 GeV/c², by picking up signals from the scattering of a dark matter particle off an <em>atomic nucleus</em>. But there&#8217;s a workable strategy, Essig argued, for picking up the scattering of a dark matter particle off an <em>electron</em> in an atom. Detecting dark matter particles with masses down to 10 MeV/c² could soon be possible in XENON/LUX-type detectors, and sensitivity to 1 MeV/c² might someday be possible in CDMS-type (i.e. solid-state) detectors.  This opens a new opportunity to look for dark matter in a form that previously would have slipped through our nets.</p>
<p><strong>The Debates Will Continues</strong></p>
<p>Though dark matter continues to elude our attempts to identify it, many experiments are continuing to seek this mysterious stuff, using a wide variety of methods. We can expect more hints of progress (most of them false alarms) over the coming decade. But can we expect an actual discovery? Only the heavens know.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Familiar throughout our international culture, the &#8220;Big Bang&#8221; is well-known as the theory that scientists use to describe and explain the history of the universe. But the theory is not a single conceptual unit, and there are parts that are more reliable than others.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to understand that the theory &#8212; a set of equations describing how the universe <em>(more precisely, the <strong><em>observable patch</em></strong> of our universe, which may be a tiny fraction of the universe)</em> changes over time, and leading to sometimes precise predictions for what should, if the theory is right, be observed by humans in the sky &#8212; actually consists of different periods, some of which are far more speculative than others.  In the more speculative early periods, we must use equations in which we have limited confidence at best; moreover, data relevant to these periods, from observations of the cosmos and from particle physics experiments, is slim to none. In more recent periods, our confidence is very, very strong.</p>
<p>In my <a title="History of the Universe" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/" target="_blank">&#8220;History of the Universe&#8221; article</a> <em>[see also my related articles on <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">cosmic inflation</a>, on the <a title="Hot Big Bang" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/hot-big-bang/" target="_blank">Hot Big Bang</a>, and on the <a title="Before Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/before-inflation/" target="_blank">pre-inflation period</a>; also a comment that <a title="Big Bang: Expansion, NOT Explosion" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/big-bang-expansion-not-explosion/" target="_blank">the Big Bang is an expansion, <strong>not</strong> an explosion!</a>]</em>, the following figure appears, though without the colored zones, which I&#8217;ve added for this post. The colored zones emphasize what we know, what we suspect, and what we don&#8217;t know at all.</p>

In each colored zone, the degree of confidence and the observational/experimental source of that confidence is indicated. Three different possible starting points for the &#8220;Big Bang&#8221; are noted at the bottom; note that individual scientists may mean different things by the term.  <em>(Caution: there is a subtlety in the use of the words &#8220;Extremely Cold&#8221;; there are subtle quantum effects that I haven&#8217;t yet written about that complicate this notion.)</em></p></div>
<p>Notice that in the figure, I don&#8217;t measure time from the start of the universe.  That&#8217;s because I don&#8217;t <em>know</em> how or when the universe started (and in particular, the notion that <a title="Did The Universe Really Begin With a Singularity?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/21/did-the-universe-begin-with-a-singularity/" target="_blank">it started from a singularity</a>, or worse, <a title="Big Bang: Expansion, NOT Explosion" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/big-bang-expansion-not-explosion/" target="_blank">an exploding &#8220;cosmic egg&#8221;</a>, is simply an over-extrapolation to the past and a misunderstanding of what the theory actually says.) Instead I measure time from the start of the <strong>Hot</strong> Big Bang in the observable patch of the universe.  <em>I also don&#8217;t even know precisely when the Hot Big Bang started, but the uncertainty on that initial time (relative to other events) is less than one second &#8212; so all the times I&#8217;ll mention, which are much longer than that, aren&#8217;t affected by this uncertainty.</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll now take you through the different confidence zones of the Big Bang, from the latest to the earliest, as indicated in the figure above.</p>
<p><span id="more-7537"></span></p>
<p><strong>The Green Zone: Confidence</strong></p>
<p>A key clue that the observable patch of the universe was once hot and dense, and cooling as it expanded &#8212; i.e. that there <em>was</em> a Hot Big Bang period (preceded perhaps by cosmic inflation, but we don&#8217;t need to focus on that yet) &#8212; is the presence in the universe of the cosmic microwave background [CMB]. From all parts of the sky, an easily detectable sea of electromagnetic radiation in the form of microwaves (photons with energy about 1000 times less than photons of visible light) is streaming across the universe, and onto the Earth. Not only is the CMB a broad clue as to the universe&#8217;s past, it is also a key tool for scientists to use in finding even more precise and focused clues. Much of the history of the observable patch is imprinted in the details of the CMB.</p>
<p>A prediction of the Hot Big Bang is that the microwaves are just a sign of past heat, and of nothing else. Specifically, if you measure the microwave photons&#8217; energy, and plot <em>the amount of energy</em> coming from a patch of sky due to photons <em>of a particular frequency</em>, you should see the same plot (a &#8220;black-body spectrum&#8221;, as it is called) as you would see for photons emitted by a cold piece of ice or rock or metal.  [Yes, ice at 2.7 degrees C above <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/01/07/happy-chilly-new-year/" target="_blank">absolute zero</a> does glow in microwaves.]  The fact that the COBE satellite&#8217;s data agrees closely with the prediction of a black-body spectrum (shown in the figure) is overwhelming evidence that there was a Hot Big Bang going on at the time that atoms first formed, when the observable patch of the universe became transparent to light &#8212; a time now believed to be about 380,000 years after the Hot Big Bang began.</p>

Data from the COBE satellite is the red crosses; the green curve is the prediction of a black-body spectrum.</p></div>
<p>The most powerful evidence that a simple view of the Hot Big Bang is correct even earlier is the success of the theory (i.e. equations) for nucleosynthesis: the formation of <a title="The Nuclei of Atoms: At the Heart of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-nuclei-of-atoms-at-the-heart-of-matter/" target="_blank">atomic nuclei</a> for the lightest atoms during the Hot Big Bang.  <em>(Note the atoms themselves formed hundreds of thousands of years later, when the temperature was cool enough for <a title="Electrons: On the Outskirts of Atoms" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/electrons-on-the-outskirts-of-atoms/" target="_blank">the nuclei to capture electrons</a>.)</em>  The equations of the Hot Big Bang include</p>
<ul>
<li>Einstein&#8217;s version of gravity and</li>
<li>the &#8220;quantum field theory&#8221; used to describe <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the known particles and non-gravitational forces.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These equations can be used to calculate how abundant certain light atoms should be, if there was a Hot Big Bang.  Specifically, one can compute the ratios of how much hydrogen <em>(normal <strong>and</strong> heavy [&#8220;deuterium&#8221;])</em>, helium <em>(normal [&#8220;helium-4&#8221;] <strong>and</strong> light [&#8220;helium-3&#8221;])</em>, and lithium should be present in pristine parts of the observable patch, if the atomic nuclei of those elements were mainly forged during the cooling stages of the Hot Big Bang. If the elements other than hydrogen were only formed in stars, then there should be very little helium and virtually no deuterium in the observable patch of the universe. (Deuterium is actually destroyed in stars.) But in a cooling Hot Big Bang, a lot of helium &#8212; about 1/4 of the amount of hydrogen &#8212; and a small but measurable amount of deuterium should be produced.</p>
<p>These predictions of the Hot Big Bang depend in great detail on our understanding of particle physics and gravity &#8212; <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">of the weak nuclear force, the strong nuclear force, the electromagnetic force, the gravitational force (in Einstein&#8217;s version of it) and on the properties of neutrinos, electrons, photons, protons and neutrons.</a> And the numbers work! The amount of helium, relative to ordinary hydrogen, is predicted to be in the 20 &#8211; 25% range; deuterium is predicted to be in the range of one part in 10,000 to 100,000, helium-3 a factor of 10 smaller than that, and lithium in the part per 10 billion range. The data agree!</p>

<p>That these predictions agree with observations of the distant cosmos (see the figure below) provides a strong argument that the Hot Big Bang really occurred, and was originally hot enough to break apart nuclei.  That means that temperatures were initially at least hot enough that the typical particle had an energy of about 0.001 <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/" target="_blank">GeV</a>, which would have happened a few minutes after the Hot Big Bang began.  More precise measurements even help us understand how much ordinary matter there is in the observable patch of the universe, with results that agree with other measurements of the same quantity.</p>
<p>For this reason, I&#8217;ve marked the nucleosynthesis period and what follows it in <span style="color:#008000;">green</span>, to emphasize that we have strong observational evidence that the Hot Big Bang did occur, and was so hot &#8212; hot enough to destroy atomic nuclei &#8212; that the atomic nuclei around us today had to form from scratch as the temperature cooled.</p>
<p><strong>The Yellow Zone: Extrapolating a Bit Using Particle Physics</strong></p>
<p>However, for times before nucleosynthesis, the arguments are weaker. We don&#8217;t have much direct evidence for what was taking place. But we have a lot of knowledge about particle physics, up to energies of a few hundred GeV, thanks to the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC] and its predecessors over the last few decades.  So if we assume that the Hot Big Bang started at temperatures so high that a typical particle would have had an energy of a few hundred <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/" target="_blank">GeV</a>, we can calculate the observable patch&#8217;s properties from that temperature downward. At such a high temperature,</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">Higgs field would have been &#8220;off&#8221;</a>, so <a title="The Known Particles — If The Higgs Field Were Zero" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/the-known-particles-if-the-higgs-field-were-zero/" target="_blank">many particles would not have had their usual masses</a>; and</li>
<li>also, separately, quarks and gluons would have been free to roam.</li>
</ul>
<p>As the temperature cooled, we can calculate <em>(now that <a title="Discovery of the Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-discovery-of-the-higgs/" target="_blank">we know the Higgs particle&#8217;s mass</a>, and if we assume there aren&#8217;t any lightweight particles that we don&#8217;t know about)</em> that first the Higgs field would have turned &#8220;on&#8221;, making the weak nuclear force henceforth weak; and then, a bit later, the strong nuclear force would have become very strong, so that quarks and gluons and anti-quarks would have been trapped henceforth and forever into <a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/" target="_blank">protons</a>, <a title="The Nuclei of Atoms: At the Heart of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-nuclei-of-atoms-at-the-heart-of-matter/" target="_blank">neutrons</a>, anti-protons and anti-neutrons, as well as other very short-lived <a title="What’s a Hadron?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-hadron-as-in-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">hadrons</a>.</p>
<p>However, we can&#8217;t yet directly confirm <em>by cosmological observation</em> that this is true.  It&#8217;s not entirely impossible that there was something odd and unknown about the universe that makes some of these conclusions premature. Someday we may be able to be more certain, but not yet. So in this time period, starting just before the Higgs field turns on and going until nucleosynthesis, we have a highly educated guess as to what was happening, though no direct experimental checks.  That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve marked this time period in <span style="color:#333333;">yellow</span>.</p>
<p><strong>The Orange Zone: What Started the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Hot</span> Big Bang?</strong></p>
<p>Even earlier? Well, at even higher temperatures we don&#8217;t know the particle physics with confidence; we&#8217;d need particle accelerators more powerful than the LHC.  To figure out what happened in the Big Bang in detail, we have to make assumptions about the particles available, without any way to check them. But still, we are not without information, because we do have an experimental probe: the CMB itself.</p>
<p>It is a remarkable fact that the CMB is incredibly uniform, to one part in 100,000. That&#8217;s already information, and explaining why it&#8217;s true is one of the arguments in favor of <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">cosmic inflation</a>.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s much, much more information in the <em>imperfections</em> in that uniformity. The non-uniformities, which were discovered by the COBE satellite, have been studied in detail by the WMAP and Planck satellites, along with many other experiments from the ground. And it was in studying the non-uniformities in the CMB and their tiny bit of polarization that BICEP2 made <a title="BICEP2: New Evidence Of Cosmic Inflation!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/bicep2-new-evidence-of-cosmic-inflation/" target="_blank">the big (but <del>unconfirmed</del> now discredited) discovery that was announced last week</a> (here&#8217;s some <a title="A Primer On Today’s Events" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/a-primer-on-todays-events/" target="_blank">background information on that discovery, in the form of FAQs, that you may find useful</a>).</p>
<p>The photons in the CMB are astonishingly sensitive. There are very few things that affect them, and fortunately, most of the things that do are relics from the extremely early periods of the observable patch of the universe. It&#8217;s an unexpected gift for scientists that this is true! The CMB photons were created about 380,000 years after the Hot Big Bang, and yet they give us insight into the entire period before that, all the way back to a period <em>just before</em> the Hot Big Bang!!!  (They also can give us important insights into what happened <em>after</em> 380,000 years, too.)  To me, this incredibly sensitivity of the CMB is one of the most amazing natural phenomena in all of science&#8230; and it has been the key to progress in cosmology in recent years.</p>
<p>Detailed measurements of the CMB have increasingly given us insight into the zone marked in orange, where we don&#8217;t have any particle physics data &#8212; just guesses, and calculations based on those guesses.  The reason insights have been possible is that our calculations rely on very general properties of the Hot Big Bang and the pre-Hot Big Bang period to make predictions.  What I mean by this is that these calculations begin with very simple assumptions about the patterns of non-uniformities that were present at the start of the Hot Big Bang, and then we check if these assumptions give predictions for non-uniformities in the CMB that agree with data.  They do!  This is shown in the figure below, where predictions of the Hot Big Bang theory, <em>with these simple assumptions about the starting point</em>, are compared with data from the Planck satellite. (Similar but less precise measurements were made before Planck, by WMAP and a number of ground-based experiments.)</p>

<p>Thus, simple assumptions about the non-uniformities at the start of the Hot Big Bang seem to be right, more or less.  This lends support to the hypothesis of cosmic inflation, which can produce simple non-uniformities. But it&#8217;s not convincing, because one can imagine simple non-uniformities arising in some other way.  There is at least one alternative &#8212; the ekpyrotic universe &#8212; that is also largely consistent with this data, and there might have been others that no one has thought of.  Meanwhile, there were many qualitatively different forms that cosmic inflation might take, some of which could have been consistent with universes quite different from those with a simple Big Bang.  For example, the data has been consistent with universes that, at temperatures a bit higher than reached in the yellow zone in the figure, have more spatial dimensions than the three we&#8217;re used to. So the number of possible options in the orange zone has been very large, and the degree of speculation involved has been very high.</p>

<p>This <del>may have changed</del> with <a title="BICEP2: New Evidence Of Cosmic Inflation!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/bicep2-new-evidence-of-cosmic-inflation/">BICEP2s new measurement,</a> which <del>gives</del> unfortunately did not give powerful new evidence for cosmic inflation through inflation&#8217;s generation of gravitational waves&#8230; assuming the measurement itself, and the interpretation of the measurement, both hold up over time.  <em>[The interpretation did not.]</em> Since a measurable amount of gravitational waves can only be produced, as far as we know, if a period of inflation occurred and was <a title="If It Holds Up, What Might BICEP2′s Discovery Mean?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/18/if-its-holds-up-what-might-bicep2s-discovery-mean/" target="_blank">driven by a <strong>very</strong> large amount of &#8220;dark `energy&#8217; &#8220;</a>, BICEP2&#8217;s result may rule out all known alternatives to inflation, and significantly narrow down the options for how inflation may have occurred, excluding many of the more radical options as well as many simple ones. As such, it may increase confidence in the inflation hypothesis to change the color of the orange zone to yellow, or even, as more measurements come in and become more precise, to green.  <em>[But it did not.]</em></p>
<p>However, let&#8217;s not jump to conclusions until the measurement is confirmed with more data and by other observing teams.  <em>[You see how important it is that I write these cautionary caveats in my articles.  I have seen many measurements come and go; the fraction that stick is much less than half.]</em></p>
<p><strong>The Red Zone: Scientific Guesswork</strong></p>
<p>But BICEP2 can really only tell us about <strong><em>the late stage and exit from inflation</em></strong>. If we go deep into the inflationary period and try to go earlier, into the red zone in the figure, we face two problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>we don&#8217;t have any experimental probes of this early time, and</li>
<li>we don&#8217;t know which particle physics and/or gravity equations we should be using.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not yet have any cosmological observations that access this time period; the CMB photons bring us back to the late stage of inflation, but not further. We cannot infer much yet from CMB measurements about the &#8220;inflaton&#8221; field (and its particle) that is supposed to play the dominant particle-physics role during inflation, and we have no idea what other types of fields it may interact with, so it is hard to be sure what type of process got inflation started. Meanwhile, theoretical physics doesn&#8217;t help much either. We can try assuming that string theory is the true theory of quantum gravity in our world, but if we do that, we still find the equations are hard to solve and give, at best, a variety of possibilities. And trying to work in greater generality, without assuming string theory, doesn&#8217;t help; the calculations are still ambiguous and difficult. This doesn&#8217;t stop theoretical physicists from making educated, scientific guesses &#8212; i.e., speculations backed with concrete equations and calculations. But until we get some data that allows us to distinguish the many possibilities, we can&#8217;t say for sure what was actually happening back then.</p>
<p>So if people tells you that the universe <em>started</em> in such and such a way, perhaps &#8220;<a title="Did The Universe Really Begin With a Singularity?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/21/did-the-universe-begin-with-a-singularity/" target="_blank">with a singularity</a>&#8221; or &#8220;with a quantum fluctuation out of nothing&#8221; or &#8220;in the Big Crunch (i.e. the collapse) of a previous phase of the universe&#8221;, remember that they&#8217;re telling you about the <span style="color:#ff0000;">red zone</span>. They&#8217;re neglecting to tell you that what they&#8217;re saying is pure theory, with neither an experiment to back it up nor a clear theoretical reason to believe their suggestion is unique and preferable over someone else&#8217;s alternative. Only a bit later in cosmic history, once we focus on the late stages of inflation, and forward in time from there to nucleosynthesis, do we have both data (cosmological observation and particle physics collisions) and reasonably reliable theory (Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity plus the Standard Model of particle physics). Our confidence grows as time moves forward, the observable patch of the universe cools, and physics becomes of a sort that we&#8217;ve tested in numerous experiments already.</p>
<p>From this, I hope that you can see that the Big Bang Theory really isn&#8217;t a single, undifferentiated structure.  The most reliable part of the theory is that there was, at one point, a <a title="Hot Big Bang" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/hot-big-bang/" target="_blank">Hot stage of the Big Bang</a>. (Some people call that the Big Bang, in fact.) If BICEP2&#8217;s measurement is accurate, and correctly interpreted, then the reliable portion of the theory may then include a period of <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">inflation that preceded</a> the Hot Big Bang. (Some people would call &#8220;inflation plus the Hot Big Bang&#8221; the &#8220;Big Bang&#8221;.) But anything before inflation is not in the least reliable&#8230; in particular, the notion that the universe&#8217;s heat and density increased <a title="Did The Universe Really Begin With a Singularity?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/21/did-the-universe-begin-with-a-singularity/" target="_blank">to the extent that Einstein&#8217;s equations have a singularity, presumably indicating that they&#8217;re not sufficient to describe what was going on, is an <em>assumption</em></a>. So that part of the Big Bang Theory may not survive the test of time. You should be prepared, as scientists are, to let it go.  After all, from 1960-1980 people had a vision of the early Big Bang that didn&#8217;t include something like inflation; their version was significantly adjusted as knowledge was gained, so why shouldn&#8217;t ours be?</p>
<p>Moreover, it is quite possible that the start of the universe, which people often refer to as the ultimate Big Bang, may not have had anything &#8220;Bang-ish&#8221; or even Big about it.  Yes, we might even need to let go someday of the idea that the universe truly <em>began</em> with a Big Bang. The scientific community won&#8217;t have any problem with this, because many of us have never taken that idea very seriously in the first place.  But what about the rest of our society, which seems to hold to this name and notion far harder than do scientists themselves, to the point of <em>(egad!)</em> naming a television show after it?!  The loss may be more shocking than necessary&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The past two weeks have been busy!  I was on the road, consulting with and learning from particle experimenters and theorists at Caltech and the University of California at Irvine. And I&#8217;ve been giving talks: at the University of California Santa Barbara (for <a title="Brane Waves" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/02/28/brane-waves/" target="_blank">the Joe Polchinski Fest conference</a>), at the University of California at Irvine, and yesterday in Boston at M.I.T. The Santa Barbara talk was only semi-technical, and is <a href="http://online.kitp.ucsb.edu/online/joefest_c14/" target="_blank">on-line</a>.  The latter two, much more technical, focused on the two big projects that I completed this fall (one on <a title="Where Stands Supersymmetry (as of 12/2013)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/where-stands-supersymmetry-122013/" target="_blank">whether searches for supersymmetry have been comprehensive</a>, one on <a title="Unexpected Decays of the Higgs Particle: What We Found" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/02/11/non-standard-model-higgs-particle-decays-what-we-found/" target="_blank">looking for unusual things the Higgs particle might do</a>.)</p>
<p>While this has all been going on, there have been two big stories developing in dark matter searches, and those of you who already have heard about them will have noticed I have not written much about them yet.  (In fact I <a title="X-Rays From Dark Matter? A Little Hint For You To Enjoy" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/02/18/x-rays-from-dark-matter-a-little-hint-for-you-to-enjoy/">only wrote about one of them</a>, and very partially.)  These stories are important, and also have some subtleties, which I want to make sure I understand fully before I try to explain them.  After consultations with some of the experts (including Kev Abazajian of U.C. Irvine and Tracey Slatyer of M.I.T) I&#8217;m a lot closer to that point, so an explanation will come soon, after I&#8217;ve done a bit more reading and learning.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">For the moment let me just note that there are two completely different excesses &#8212; </span></p>
<ul>
<li>one in X-ray photons (specifically photons with energies of about 3500 <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/" target="_blank">eV</a>) noticed by two groups of scientists in a number of different galaxies, and</li>
<li>one in gamma ray photons (specifically photons with energies of 1 &#8211; 10 GeV [<a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/" target="_blank">GeV = 1,000,000,000 eV</a>]), extracted with care by one group of scientists from a complex set of astrophysical gamma ray sources, coming from a spherical region around, and extending well beyond, the center of our own galaxy.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">These seem to the experts I&#8217;ve spoken with to be <em>real</em> excesses, signs of <em>real</em> phenomena &#8212; that is, they do not appear to be artifacts of measurement problems or to be pure statistical flukes. This is in contrast to yet another bright hint of dark matter &#8212; <a title="Dark Matter: Now You See It, Now You Don’t" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/04/20/dark-matter-now-you-see-it-now-you-dont/" target="_blank">an excess of photons with energy of about 130 GeV measured by the Fermi satellite</a> &#8212; which currently is suspected by some experts, though not all, to be due to a measurement problem. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">But even if the experts are right about that, it still leaves the big question: are these excesses signals of previously unknown astrophysical phenomena, or are they signals of decaying or annihilating dark matter particles?  New astrophysics would be interesting too, but probably not Nobel-worthy, as dark matter would be.  There are arguments against astrophysical explanations in both cases, but they don&#8217;t seem by any means airtight yet.</span></p>
<p>Since the two excesses are completely different, it is highly likely that <strong>at least one</strong> of them is due to astrophysics.   <em>[You can invent types of dark matter that would give you both signals &#8212; but it would take a small miracle for two signals of the same dark matter particles to show up in the same year.]</em>  In fact, it is quite likely, in my mind, that they&#8217;re both due to astrophysics, not particle physics. But dark matter <em>might</em> show up in this way, so these excesses have to be explored fully.  It could be that this is the moment when dark matter is finally revealed.  If so &#8212; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Tell_the_Truth" target="_blank">would the real dark matter excess please stand up</a>?</p>
