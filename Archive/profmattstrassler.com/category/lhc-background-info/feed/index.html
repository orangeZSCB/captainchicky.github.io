										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A little while back I wrote a <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/02/13/breaking-a-little-new-ground-at-the-large-hadron-collider/">short post</a> about some research that some colleagues and I did using &#8220;open data&#8221; from the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC]. We used data made public by the <a href="https://home.cern/science/experiments/cms">CMS experimental collaboration</a> &#8212; about 1% of their current data &#8212; to search for a new particle, using a couple of twists (as proposed over 10 years ago) on a standard technique.  (CMS is one of the two general-purpose particle detectors at the LHC; the other is called ATLAS.)  We had two motivations: (1) Even if we didn&#8217;t find a new particle, we wanted to prove that our search method was effective; and (2) we wanted to stress-test the CMS Open Data framework, to assure it really does provide all the information needed for a search for something unknown.</p>
<p><a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/02/19/a-broad-search-for-fast-hidden-particles/">Recently I discussed</a> (1), and today I want to address (2): to convey why open data from the LHC is useful but controversial, and why we felt it was important, as theoretical physicists <em>(i.e. people who perform particle physics calculations, but do not build and run the actual experiments)</em>, to do something with it that is usually the purview of experimenters.</p>
<p><strong>The Importance of Archiving Data</strong></p>
<p>In many subfields of physics and astronomy, data from experiments is made public as a matter of routine. Usually this occurs after an substantial delay, to allow the experimenters who collected the data to analyze it first for major discoveries. That&#8217;s as it should be: the experimenters spent years of their lives proposing, building and testing the experiment, and they deserve an uninterrupted opportunity to investigate its data. To force them to release data immediately would create a terrible disincentive for anyone to do all the hard work!</p>
<p>Data from particle physics colliders, however, has not historically been made public. More worrying, it has rarely been archived in a form that is easy for others to use at a later date. I&#8217;m not the right person to tell you the history of this situation, but I can give you a sense for why this still happens today.<span id="more-10236"></span></p>
<p>The fundamental issue is the complexity of data sets from colliders, especially from <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-hadron-as-in-large-hadron-collider/">hadron</a> colliders such as the Tevatron and the LHC. (Archiving was partly done for <a href="https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-electron-positron-collider">LEP</a>, a simpler collider, and was used in later studies including <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1003.0705">this search for unusual Higgs decays</a>  and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06536">this controversial observation,</a> also <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2016/10/21/hiding-from-a-nightmare/">discussed here</a>.) What &#8220;complexity&#8221; are we talking about? Collisions of <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/">protons</a> and/or anti-protons are intrinsically complicated; particles of all sorts go <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/2114779/files/diphoton_v0.png">flying in all directions</a>. The general purpose particle detectors ATLAS and CMS have a complex shape and aren&#8217;t uniform. (Here&#8217;s <a href="https://cms.cern/detector">a cutaway image showing CMS as a set of nested almost-cylinders</a>. Note also that there are inherent weak points: places where cooling tubes have to run, where bundles of wires have to bring signals in and out of the machine, and where segments of the detector join together.) Meanwhile the interactions of the particles with the detector&#8217;s material is messy and often subtle (here&#8217;s <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/2270046/files/Figure_001.png">a significantly oversimplified view</a>). Not every particle is detected, and the probability of missing one depends on where it passes through the detector and what type of particle it is.</p>
<p>Even more important, 99.999% percent of ATLAS and CMS data is discarded as it comes in; only data which passes a set of filters, collectively called <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/the-trigger-discarding-all-but-the-gold/">the &#8220;trigger,&#8221;</a> will even be stored. The trigger is adjusted regularly as experimental conditions change. If you don&#8217;t understand these filters in detail, you can&#8217;t understand the data. Meanwhile the strategies for processing the raw data change over time, becoming more sophisticated, and introducing their own issues that must be known and managed.</p>
<p>I could easily go on (did I mention that at the LHC <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/1479324/files/198609-56-3565522e.png">dozens of collisions occur simultaneously?</a>) If, when you explore the data, you fail to account for all these issues, you can mistake a glitch for a new physical effect, or fail to observe a new physical effect because a glitch obscured it. Any experimentalist inside the collaborations is aware of most of these subtleties, and is surrounded by other experts who will be quick to complain if he or she forgets to account for one of them. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s rare for the experimenters to report a result that has this type of error embedded in it.</p>
<p>Now,<strong><em> imagine writing a handbook that would encapsulate all of that combined knowledge, for use by people who will someday analyze the data without having access to that collective human library.</em></strong> This handbook would accompany an enormous data set taken in changing conditions, and would need to contain everything a person could possibly need to know in order to properly analyze data from an LHC experiment without making a technical error.</p>
<p><strong>Not easy!</strong> But this is what the <a href="http://opendata.cern.ch/">Open Data project at CERN</a>, in which CMS is one of the participating experiments, aims to do. Because it&#8217;s extremely difficult, and therefore expensive in personnel and time, its value has to be clear.</p>
<p>I personally do think the value <strong><em>is</em></strong> clear, especially at the LHC. Until the last couple of decades, one could argue that data from an old particle physics experiment would go out of date so quickly, superseded by better experiments, that it really wasn&#8217;t needed. But this argument has broken down as experiments have become more expensive, with new ones less frequent. There is no guarantee, for instance, that any machine superseding the LHC will be built during my lifetime; it is a minimum of 20 and perhaps 40 years away. In all that time, the LHC&#8217;s data will be the state of the art in proton-proton collider physics, so it ought to be stored so that experts can use it 25 years from now. The price for making that possible has to be paid.</p>
<p><em>[This price was not paid for the Tevatron, whose data, which will remain the gold standard for <strong>proton-antiproton</strong> collisions for perhaps a century or more, is not well-archived.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Was Using Open Data Necessary For Our Project?</strong></p>
<p>Even if we all agree that it&#8217;s important to archive LHC data so that it can be used by future experimental physicists, it&#8217;s not obvious that <strong><em>today&#8217;s theorists</em> </strong>should use it. There&#8217;s an alternative: a theorist with a particular idea can temporarily join one of the experimental collaborations, and carry out the research with like-minded experimental colleagues. In principle, this is a much better way to do things; it permits access to the full data set, it allows the expert experimentalists to handle and manage the data instead of amateurs like us, and it should in principle lead to state-of-the-art results.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t found this approach to work. I&#8217;ve been recommending the use of our technique <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/02/19/a-broad-search-for-fast-hidden-particles/"><em>[selecting events where the transverse momentum of the muon and antimuon pair is large, and often dropping isolation requirements]</em></a> for over ten years, along with several related techniques. These remarks appear in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0712.2041">papers</a>; I&#8217;ve mentioned these issues in <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/94815/contributions/1282671/">many talks</a>, discussed them in detail with at least two dozen experimentalists at ATLAS and CMS (including many colleagues at Harvard), and even started a preliminary project with an experimenter to study them. But everyone had a reason not to proceed. I was told, over and over again, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, we&#8217;ll get to this next year.&#8221; After a decade of this, I came to feel that perhaps it would be best if we carried out the analysis ourselves.</p>
<p>Even then, there was an alternative: we could have just done a study of our method using simulated data, and this would have proved the value of our technique. Why spend the huge amount of time and effort to do a detailed analysis, on a fraction of the real data?</p>
<p>First, I worried that a study on simulated data would be no more effective than all of the talks I gave and all the personal encouraging I did over the previous ten years. I think seeing the study done for real has a lot more impact, because it shows explicitly how effective the technique is and how easily it is implemented. <em>[Gosh, if even theorists can do it&#8230;]</em></p>
<p>Second, one of the things we did in our study is include &#8220;non-isolated muons&#8221; &#8212; muons that have other particles close by &#8212; which are normally not included in theorists&#8217; studies. Dropping the usual isolation criteria may be essential for discoveries of hidden particles, as Kathryn Zurek and I have emphasized since 2006 (and studied in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0712.2041">a paper with Han and Si, in 2007</a>). I felt it was important to show this explicitly in our study. But we needed the real data to do this; simulation of the background sources for non-isolated muons would not have been accurate. <em>[The experimenters rarely use non-isolated muons in the type of analysis we carried out, but notably <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01890">have been doing so here</a>; my impression is that they were unaware of our work from 2007 and came to this approach independently.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Stress Testing the Archive</strong></p>
<p>A further benefit to using the real data was that we stress-tested the archiving procedure in the Open Data project, and to do this fully, we had to carry out our analysis to the very end. The success or failure of our analysis was a test of whether the CMS Open Data framework truly provides all the information needed to do a complete search for something unknown.</p>
<p>The test received a passing grade, with qualifications. Not only we did complete the project, we were able to repeat a rather precise measurement of the (well-known) cross-section for Z boson production, which would have failed if the archive and the accompanying information had been unusable. That said, there is room for improvement: small things were missing, including some calibration information and some simulated data. The biggest issue is perhaps the format for the data storage (difficult to use and unpack for a typical user).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to recognize that the persons in charge of Open Data at CMS have a huge and difficult job; they have to figure out how to write the nearly impossible handbook I referred to above. It&#8217;s therefore crucial that people like our group of theorists actually use the open data sets <em><strong>now</strong></em>, not just after the LHC is over. <em><strong>Now</strong></em>, when the open data sets are still small, is the time to figure out what information is missing, to determine how to improve the data storage, to fill out the documentation and make sure it has no gaps. We hope we&#8217;ve contributed something to that process.</p>
<p><strong>The Future</strong></p>
<p>Should others follow in our footsteps? Yes, I think, though not lightly. In our case, five experts required two years to do the simplest possible study; we could have done it in one year if we&#8217;d been more efficient, but probably not much less. Do not underestimate what this takes, both in terms of understanding the data and learning how to do statistical analysis that most people rarely undertake.</p>
<p>But there are studies that simply cannot be done without real data, and unless you can convince an experimentalist to work with you, your only choice may be to dive in and do your best. And if you are already somewhat informed, but want to learn more about how real experimental analysis is done, so you can appreciate more fully what is typically hidden from view, you will not find a better self-training ground. If you want to take it on, I suggest, as an initial test, that you try to replicate our measurement of the Z boson cross-section. If you can&#8217;t, you&#8217;re not ready for anything else.</p>
<p>I should emphasize that Open Data is a resource that can be used in other ways, and several groups have already done this. In addition to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05842">detailed studies</a> of <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/jets-the-manifestation-of-quarks-and-gluons/">jets</a> carried out on the <em><strong>real</strong></em> data by my collaborators, led by Professor Jesse Thaler, there have been <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11916">studies</a> that have relied solely on the archive of <em><strong>simulated</strong></em> data also provided by the CMS Open Data project. These have value too, in that they offer proving grounds for techniques to be applied later to real data. Since exploratory studies of simulated data don&#8217;t require the extreme care that analysis of real data demands, there may be a lot of potential in this aspect of the Open Data project.</p>
<p>In the end, our research study, like most analyses, is just a drop in the huge bucket of information learned from the LHC. Its details should not obscure the larger question: <em><strong>how shall we, as a community, maintain the LHC data set so that it can continue to provide information across the decades?</strong></em> Maybe the Open Data project is the best approach.  If so, how can we best support it?  And if not, what is the alternative?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, a small but intrepid band of theoretical particle physicists (professor Jesse Thaler of MIT, postdocs Yotam Soreq and Wei Xue of CERN, Harvard Ph.D. student Cari Cesarotti, and myself) put out <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04222">a paper</a> that is unconventional in two senses. First, we looked for new particles at the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">Large Hadron Collider</a> in a way that hasn&#8217;t been done before, at least in public. And second, we looked for new particles at the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">Large Hadron Collider</a> in a way that hasn&#8217;t been done before, at least in public.</p>
<p>And no, there&#8217;s no error in the previous paragraph.</p>
<p>1) We used a small amount of <strong>actual data from the <a href="https://home.cern/science/experiments/cms">CMS experiment</a></strong>, even though we&#8217;re not ourselves members of the CMS experiment, to do a search for a new particle. Both ATLAS and CMS, the two large multipurpose experimental detectors at the Large Hadron Collider [LHC], have made a small fraction of their proton-proton collision data public, through a website called the <a href="http://opendata.cern.ch/">CERN Open Data Portal</a>. Some experts, including my co-authors Thaler, Xue and their colleagues, have used this data (and the simulations that accompany it) to do a variety of important studies involving known particles and their properties. [Here&#8217;s <a href="http://cylindricalonion.web.cern.ch/blog/201712/future-particle-physics-open">a blog post by Thaler concerning Open Data and its importance from his perspective.</a>] But our new study is the first to <strong><em>look for signs of a new particle in this public data</em></strong>. While our chances of finding anything were low, we had a larger goal: to see whether Open Data could be used for such searches. We hope our paper provides some evidence that Open Data offers a reasonable path for preserving priceless LHC data, allowing it to be used as an archive by physicists of the post-LHC era.</p>
<p>2) Since only had a tiny fraction of CMS&#8217;s data was available to us, about 1% by some count, how could we have done anything useful compared to what the LHC experts have already done? Well, that&#8217;s why we examined the data in a slightly unconventional way (one of <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/94815/contributions/1282671/">several methods that I&#8217;ve advocated for many years</a>, but has not been used in any public study). Consequently it allowed us to explore some ground that no one had yet swept clean, and even have a tiny chance of an actual discovery! But the larger scientific goal, absent a discovery, was <strong>to prove the value of this unconventional strategy</strong>, in hopes that the experts at CMS and ATLAS will use it (and others like it) in future. Their chance of discovering something new, using their full data set, is vastly greater than ours ever was.</p>
<p>Now don&#8217;t all go rushing off to download and analyze terabytes of CMS Open Data; you&#8217;d better know what you&#8217;re getting into first. It&#8217;s worthwhile, but it&#8217;s not easy going. LHC data is extremely complicated, and until this project I&#8217;ve always been skeptical that it could be released in a form that anyone outside the experimental collaborations could use. Downloading the data and turning it into a manageable form is itself a major task. Then, while studying it, there are an enormous number of mistakes that you can make (and we made quite a few of them) and you&#8217;d better know how to make lots of cross-checks to find your mistakes (which, fortunately, we did know; we hope we found all of them!) The CMS personnel in charge of the Open Data project were enormously helpful to us, and we&#8217;re very grateful to them; but since the project is new, there were inevitable wrinkles which had to be worked around. And you&#8217;d better have some friends among the experimentalists who can give you advice when you get stuck, or point out aspects of your results that don&#8217;t look quite right. [Our thanks to them!]</p>
<p>All in all, this project took us two years! Well, honestly, it should have taken half that time &#8212; but it couldn&#8217;t have taken much less than that, with all we had to learn. So trying to use Open Data from an LHC experiment is not something you do in your idle free time.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I feel it was worth it. At a personal level, I learned a great deal more about how experimental analyses are carried out at CMS, and by extension, at the LHC more generally. And more importantly, we were able to show what we&#8217;d hoped to show: that <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em><strong>there are still tremendous opportunities for discovery at the LHC</strong></em></span>, through the use of (even slightly) unconventional model-independent analyses. It&#8217;s a big world to explore, and we took only a small step in the easiest direction, but perhaps our efforts will encourage others to take bigger and more challenging ones.</p>
<p>For those readers with greater interest in our work, I&#8217;ll put out more details in two blog posts over the next few days: one about what we looked for and how, and one about our views regarding the value of open data from the LHC, not only for our project but for the field of particle physics as a whole.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the long and careful process of restarting the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC] after its two-year nap for upgrades and repairs, another milestone has been reached: <a href="http://home.web.cern.ch/about/updates/2015/05/low-energy-collisions-tune-lhc-experiments">protons have once again collided inside the LHC&#8217;s experimental detectors</a> (named ATLAS, CMS, LHCb and ALICE). This is good news, but don&#8217;t get excited yet. It&#8217;s just one small step. These are collisions at the lowest energy at which the LHC operates (450 GeV per proton, to be compared with the 4000 GeV per proton in 2012 and the 6500 GeV per proton they&#8217;ve already achieved in the last month, though in non-colliding beams.) Also the number of protons in the beams, and the number of collisions per second, is still very, very small compared to what will be needed. So discoveries are not imminent!  Yesterday&#8217;s milestone was just one of the many little tests that are made to assure that the LHC is properly set up and ready for the first full-energy collisions, which should start in about a month.</p>
<p>But since full-energy collisions are on the horizon, why not listen to a radio show about what the LHC will be doing after its restart is complete? Today (Wednesday May 6th), <a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/virtually-speaking-science">Virtually Speaking Science</a>, on which I have appeared a couple of times before, will run a program at 5 pm Pacific time (8 pm Eastern). Science writer Alan Boyle will be interviewing me about the LHC&#8217;s plans for the next few months and the coming years. You can listen live, or listen later once they post it.  <a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/virtually-speaking-science/2015/05/07/alan-boyle-matt-strassler-large-hadron-collider">Here&#8217;s the link for the program.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As promised in <a title="Dark Matter: How Could the Large Hadron Collider Discover It?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2015/04/13/dark-matter-how-could-the-large-hadron-collider-discover-it/">my last post</a>, I&#8217;ve now written the answer to the second of the three questions I posed about how the Large Hadron Collider [LHC] can search for dark matter.  <a title="Searching for Dark Matter at the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/dark-matter/searching-for-dark-matter-at-the-lhc/">You can read the answers to the first two questions here</a>. The first question was about how scientists can possibly look for something that passes through a detector without leaving any trace!  The second question is how scientists can tell the difference between ordinary production of neutrinos &#8212; which also leave no trace &#8212; and production of something else. [The answer to the third question &#8212; how one could determine this &#8220;something else&#8221; really <strong>is</strong> what makes up dark matter &#8212; will be added to the article later this week.]</p>
<p>In the meantime, after Monday&#8217;s post, I got a number of interesting questions about dark matter, why most experts are confident it exists, etc.  There are many reasons to be confident; it&#8217;s not just one argument, but a set of interlocking arguments.  One of the most powerful comes from simulations of the universe&#8217;s history.  These simulations</p>
<ul>
<li>start with what we think <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/26/which-parts-of-the-big-bang-theory-are-reliable/">we know about the early universe from the cosmic microwave background</a> [CMB], including the amount of ordinary and dark matter inferred from the CMB (assuming Einstein&#8217;s gravity theory is right), and also including the degree of non-uniformity of the local temperature and density;</li>
<li>and use equations for known physics, including Einstein&#8217;s gravity, the behavior of gas and dust when compressed and heated, the effects of various forms of electromagnetic radiation on matter, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>The output of the these simulations is a prediction for the universe today &#8212; and indeed, it roughly has the properties of the one we inhabit.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.illustris-project.org/movies/illustris_movie_cube_sub_frame.mp4">a video from the Illustris collaboration</a>, which has done the most detailed simulation of the universe so far.  Note the age of the universe listed at the bottom as the video proceeds.  On the left side of the video you see dark matter.  It quickly clumps under the force of gravity, forming a wispy, filamentary structure with dense knots, which then becomes rather stable; moderately dense regions are blue, highly dense regions are pink.  On the right side is shown gas.  You see that <strong><em>after the dark matter structure begins to form</em></strong>, that structure attracts gas, also through gravity, which then forms galaxies (blue knots) around the dense knots of dark matter.  The galaxies then form black holes with energetic disks and jets, and stars, many of which explode.   These much more complicated astrophysical effects blow clouds of heated gas (red) into intergalactic space.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the distribution of galaxies in the real universe, as measured by astronomers, is illustrated <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08LBltePDZw">in this video</a> from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.   You can see by eye that the galaxies in our universe show a filamentary structure, with big nearly-empty spaces, and loose strings of galaxies ending in big clusters.  That&#8217;s consistent with what is seen in the Illustris simulation.</p>
<p>Now if you&#8217;d like to drop the dark matter idea, the question you have to ask is this: could the simulations still give a universe similar to ours <strong><em>if you took dark matter out and instead modified Einstein&#8217;s gravity somehow</em></strong>?  [Usually this type of change goes under the name of MOND.]</p>
<p>In the simulation, gravity causes the dark matter, which is &#8220;cold&#8221; (cosmo-speak for &#8220;made from objects traveling much slower than light speed&#8221;), to form filamentary structures that then serve as the seeds for gas to clump and form galaxies.  So if you want to take the dark matter out, and instead change gravity to explain other features that are normally explained by dark matter, you have a challenge.   <em>You are in danger of not creating the filamentary structure seen in our universe.</em>  Somehow your change in the equations for gravity has to cause the gas to form galaxies along filaments, and do so in the time allotted.  Otherwise it won&#8217;t lead to the type of universe that we actually live in.</p>
<p>Challenging, yes.  Challenging is not the same as impossible. But everyone one should understand that the arguments in favor of dark matter are by no means limited to the questions of how stars move in galaxies and how galaxies move in galaxy clusters.  Any implementation of MOND has to explain a lot of other things that, in most experts&#8217; eyes, are efficiently taken care of by cold dark matter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Dark Matter</strong>. Its existence is still not 100% certain, but if it exists, it is exceedingly dark, both in the usual sense &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t emit light or reflect light or scatter light &#8212; and in a more general sense &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t interact much, in <strong>any</strong> way, with ordinary stuff, like tables or floors or planets or  humans. So not only is it invisible (air is too, after all, so that&#8217;s not so remarkable), it&#8217;s actually extremely difficult to detect, even with the best scientific instruments. How difficult? We don&#8217;t even know, but certainly more difficult than <a title="How One Detects Neutrinos" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/how-one-detects-neutrinos/">neutrinos</a>, the most elusive of <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/">the known particles</a>. The only way we&#8217;ve been able to detect dark matter so far is through the pull it exerts via gravity, which is big only because there&#8217;s so much dark matter out there, and because it has slow but inexorable and remarkable effects on things that we <strong>can</strong> see, such as stars, interstellar gas, and even light itself.</p>
<p>About a week ago, the mainstream press was reporting, inaccurately, that the leading aim of the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC], after its two-year upgrade, is to discover dark matter.<em> [By the way, <a href="http://home.web.cern.ch/about/updates/2015/04/first-successful-beam-record-energy-65-tev">on Friday</a> the LHC operators made the first beams with energy-per-proton of 6.5 <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/">TeV</a>, a new record and a major milestone in the LHC&#8217;s restart.]</em>  There are many problems with such a statement, as I commented in <a title="The LHC restarts — in a manner of speaking —" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2015/04/06/the-lhc-restarts-in-a-manner-of-speaking/">my last post</a>, but let&#8217;s leave all that aside today&#8230; because it <strong><em>is</em></strong> true that the LHC can look for dark matter.   How?</p>
<p>When people suggest that the LHC can discover dark matter, they are implicitly assuming</p>
<ul>
<li>that dark matter exists (very likely, but perhaps still with some loopholes),</li>
<li>that dark matter is made from particles (which isn&#8217;t established yet) and</li>
<li>that dark matter particles can be commonly produced by the LHC&#8217;s proton-proton collisions (which need not be the case).</li>
</ul>
<p>You can question these assumptions, but let&#8217;s accept them for now.  The question for today is this: since dark matter barely interacts with ordinary matter, how can scientists at an LHC experiment like ATLAS or CMS, which is made from ordinary matter of course, have any hope of <em><strong>figuring out that they&#8217;ve made dark matter particles?</strong></em>  What would have to happen before we could see a BBC or New York Times headline that reads, &#8220;Large Hadron Collider Scientists Claim Discovery of Dark Matter&#8221;?</p>
<p>Well, to address this issue, I&#8217;m writing an article in three stages. Each stage answers one of the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>How can scientists working at ATLAS or CMS be confident that an LHC proton-proton collision has <em><strong>produced an undetected particle</strong></em> &#8212; whether this be simply a neutrino or something unfamiliar?</li>
<li>How can ATLAS or CMS scientists tell whether they are <strong><em>making something new and Nobel-Prizeworthy</em></strong>, such as dark matter particles, as opposed to making neutrinos, which they do every day, many times a second?</li>
<li>How can we be sure, if ATLAS or CMS discovers they are making undetected particles through a new and unknown process, that they are actually <strong><em>making dark matter particles</em></strong>?</li>
</ol>
<p>My answer to the first question is finished; <a title="Searching for Dark Matter at the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/dark-matter/searching-for-dark-matter-at-the-lhc/">you can read it now</a> if you like.  The second and third answers will be posted later during the week.</p>
<p>But if you&#8217;re impatient, here are highly compressed versions of the answers, in a form which is accurate, but admittedly not very clear or precise.</p>
<ol>
<li>Dark matter particles, like neutrinos, would not be observed directly. Instead their presence would be <strong>indirectly inferred</strong>, by observing the behavior of other particles that are produced alongside them.</li>
<li>It is impossible to directly distinguish dark matter particles from neutrinos or from any other new, equally undetectable particle. But the equations used to describe the <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/">known elementary particles</a> (the &#8220;Standard Model&#8221;) predict how often neutrinos are produced at the LHC. If the number of neutrino-like objects is larger that the predictions, that will mean <strong>something new is being produced</strong>.</li>
<li>To confirm that dark matter is made from LHC&#8217;s new undetectable particles will require many steps and possibly many decades. Detailed study of LHC data can allow properties of the new particles to be inferred. Then,<strong> if other types of experiments </strong>(e.g. <a title="Breaking News: Two Great New Measurements" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/30/breaking-news-two-great-new-measurements/">LUX</a> or <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/31/questions-and-answers-about-dark-matter-post-lux/">COGENT</a> or <a title="Dark Matter: Unseen, But Yet Again in the Limelight" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/04/20/dark-matter-now-you-see-it-now-you-dont/">Fermi</a>)<strong> detect dark matter itself, they can check whether it shares the same properties as LHC&#8217;s new particles</strong>. <em>Only then</em> can we know if LHC discovered dark matter.</li>
</ol>
<p>I realize these brief answers are cryptic at best, so if you want to learn more, please check out <a title="Searching for Dark Matter at the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/dark-matter/searching-for-dark-matter-at-the-lhc/">my new article</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="The Trigger: Discarding All But the Gold" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/the-trigger-discarding-all-but-the-gold/">Triggering is an essential part of the Large Hadron Collider [LHC]</a>; there are so many collisions happening each second at the LHC, compared to the number that the experiments can afford to store for later study, that the data about most of the collisions (99.999%) have to be thrown away immediately, completely and permanently within a second after the collisions occur.  The automated filter, partly hardware and partly software, that is programmed to make the decision as to what to keep and what to discard is called &#8220;the trigger&#8221;.  This all sounds crazy, but it&#8217;s necessary, and it works.   Usually.</p>
<p>Let me give you one very simple example of how things can go wrong, and how the ATLAS and CMS experiments [the two general purpose experiments at the LHC] attempted to address the problem.  Before you read this, you may want to read <a title="Final Days of Busy Visit to CERN" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/12/02/final-days-of-busy-visit-to-cern/"><span style="color:#000000;">my last post</span></a>, which gives an overview of what I&#8217;ll be talking about in this one.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Day 2 of my visit to CERN (host laboratory of the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC]) was a pretty typical CERN day for me. Here&#8217;s a rough sketch of how it panned out:</p>
<ul>
<li>1000: after a few chores, arrived at CERN by tram. Worked on my ongoing research project #1. Answered an email about my ongoing research project #2.</li>
<li>1100: attended a one hour talk, much of it historical, by Chris Quigg, one of the famous experts on &#8220;quarkonium&#8221; (atom-like objects made from a quark or anti-quark, generally referring specifically to charm and bottom quarks). Charmonium (charm quark/antiquark atoms) was discovered 40 years ago this week, in two very different experiments.</li>
<li>1200: Started work on the talk that I am giving on the afternoon of Day 3 to some experimentalists who work at ATLAS. <em>[ATLAS and CMS are the two general-purpose experimental detectors at the LHC; they were used to <a title="Discovery of the Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-discovery-of-the-higgs/" target="_blank">discover the Higgs particle</a>.]</em> It involves some new insights concerning the search for long-lived particles <em>(hypothesized types of new particles that would typically <a title="Most Particles Decay — But Why?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/why-do-particles-decay/most-particles-decay-why/" target="_blank">decay</a> only after having traveled a distance of at least a millimeter, and possibly a meter or more, before they decay to other particles.)</em></li>
<li>1230: Working lunch with an experimentalist from ATLAS and another theorist, mainly discussing <a title="The Trigger: Discarding All But the Gold" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/the-trigger-discarding-all-but-the-gold/" target="_blank">triggering</a>, and other related issues, concerning long-lived particles. Learned a lot about the new opportunities that ATLAS will have starting in 2015.</li>
<li>1400: In an extended discussion with two other theorists, got a partial answer to a subtle question that arose in my research project #2.</li>
<li>1415: Sent an email to my collaborators on research project #2.</li>
<li>1430: Back to work on my talk for Day 3. Reading some relevant papers, drawing some illustrations, etc.</li>
<li>1600: Two-hour conversation over coffee with an experimentalist from CMS, yet again about triggering, regarding long-lived particles, exotic decays of the Higgs particle, and both at once. Learned a lot of important things about CMS&#8217;s plans for the near-term and medium-term future, as well as some of the subtle issues with collecting and analyzing data that are likely to arise in 2015, when the LHC begins running again.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>[Why triggering, triggering, triggering? Because if you don&#8217;t collect the data in the first place, you can&#8217;t analyze it later!  We have to be working on triggering in 2014-2015 before the LHC takes data again in 2015-2018]</em></p>
<ul>
<li>1800: An hour to work on the talk again.</li>
<li>1915: Skype conversation with two of my collaborators in research project #1, about a difficult challenge which had been troubling me for over a week. Subtle theoretical issues and heavy duty discussion, but worth it in the end; most of the issues look like they may be resolvable.</li>
<li>2100: Noticed the time and that I hadn&#8217;t eaten dinner yet. Went to the CERN cafeteria and ate dinner while answering emails.</li>
<li>2130: More work on the talk for Day 3.</li>
<li>2230: Left CERN. Wrote blog post on the tram to the hotel.</li>
<li>2300: Went back to work in my hotel room.</li>
</ul>
<p>Day 1 was similarly busy and informative, but had the added feature that I hadn&#8217;t slept since the previous day. (I never seem to sleep on overnight flights.) Day 3 is likely to be as busy as Day 2. I&#8217;ll be leaving Geneva before dawn on Day 4, heading to a conference.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a hectic schedule, but I&#8217;m learning many things!  And if I can help make these huge and crucial experiments more powerful, and give my colleagues a greater chance of a discovery and a reduced chance of missing one, it will all be worth it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, <a title="BICEP2: New Evidence Of Cosmic Inflation!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/bicep2-new-evidence-of-cosmic-inflation/" target="_blank">yesterday was quite a day</a>, and I&#8217;m still sifting through the consequences.</p>
<p>First things first.  As with all major claims of discovery, <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">considerable caution is advised until the BICEP2 measurement has been verified by some other experiment</span></strong>.   Moreover, even if the measurement is correct, <span style="color:#800080;"><strong>one should not assume that the interpretation in terms of gravitational waves and inflation is correct; this requires more study and further confirmation.</strong></span></p>
<p>The media <strong>is</strong> assuming BICEP2&#8217;s measurement is correct, and that the interpretation in terms of inflation is correct, but leading scientists are not so quick to rush to judgment, and are thinking things through carefully.  Scientists are cautious not just because they&#8217;re trained to be thoughtful and careful but also because <em><strong>they&#8217;ve seen many claims of discovery withdrawn or discredited</strong></em>; discoveries are made when humans go where no one has previously gone, with technology that no one has previously used &#8212; and surprises, mistakes, and misinterpretations happen often.</p>
<p>But in this post, I&#8217;m going to <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">assume</span> <span style="color:#ff9900;">assume</span> <span style="color:#0000ff;">assume</span></strong> that BICEP2&#8217;s results are correct, or essentially correct, and are being correctly interpreted.  Let&#8217;s <strong>assume</strong> that <em>[here&#8217;s <a title="A Primer On Today’s Events" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/a-primer-on-todays-events/" target="_blank">a primer on yesterday&#8217;s result that defines these terms</a>]</em></p>
<ul>
<li>they really have detected &#8220;B-mode polarization&#8221; in the &#8220;CMB&#8221; [Cosmic Microwave Background, the photons (particles of light) that are the ancient, cool glow leftover from <a title="Hot Big Bang" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/hot-big-bang/" target="_blank">the Hot Big Bang</a>]</li>
<li>that this B-mode polarization really is a sign of gravitational waves generated during a brief but dramatic period of <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">cosmic inflation</a> that immediately preceded <a title="Hot Big Bang" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/hot-big-bang/" target="_blank">the Hot Big Bang</a>,</li>
</ul>
<p>Then &#8212; <span style="color:#ff0000;">IF</span> BICEP2&#8217;s results were basically right and were being correctly interpreted concerning inflation &#8212; what would be the implications?</p>
<p>Well&#8230;<strong> <em>Wow&#8230;  </em></strong>They&#8217;d really be quite amazing.<span id="more-7493"></span></p>
<p>Would this story be bigger than the <a title="The Day of the Higgs!!!!  DISCOVERY!!! History Made!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/07/04/the-day-of-the-higgs/" target="_blank">discovery of the Higgs particle</a>?  Certainly <em><strong>at least as</strong></em> big.  To try to compare the two gets us into silly discussions; you can&#8217;t know the long-term implications of a discovery at or near the time it is made.  But the immediate list of implications would certainly be longer.</p>
<p><strong>Some Definitions</strong></p>
<p>Before I start: we&#8217;ll need some definitions, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/some-definitions-for-cosmology/" target="_blank">given in this article</a>, of:</p>
<ul>
<li>A unit of energy called GeV (roughly the mass-energy of a hydrogen atom)</li>
<li>The Planck energy, Planck mass and Planck length (processes involving the Planck energy or mass in a region the size of the Planck length will generally involve both quantum mechanics and gravity [&#8220;quantum gravity&#8221;])</li>
<li>The energy scale associated with dark energy (which is not quite the amount of dark energy &#8212; for one thing, despite the name, dark `energy&#8217; is actually an energy per unit volume.)</li>
</ul>
<p>If any of these is unfamiliar to you, you may want to read <a title="Some Definitions for Cosmology" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/some-definitions-for-cosmology/" target="_blank">that article</a> first and to have it handy, in another tab or window, to serve as a glossary.  You may also want to have my <a title="History of the Universe" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/" target="_blank">History of the Universe</a> or my <a title="A Primer On Today’s Events" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/a-primer-on-todays-events/" target="_blank">BICEP2 Discovery Primer</a> hand.</p>
<p><strong>Implications of BICEP2&#8217;s Discovery &#8212;</strong> <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">IF &#8230; IF &#8230;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">IF IF IF</span></strong> BICEP2&#8217;s measurement is correct, at least roughly, and <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">IF IF IF </span></strong>it is being correctly interpreted, at least roughly, then there&#8217;s a long list of broad implications that I can think of, or that others of my colleagues have pointed out to me in conversations.  Some of them are vague &#8212; areas where the implications are likely to be important but are not yet very clear.  Some of these things were already somewhat implied by the previous experimental successes of the theory of inflation, while some stem directly from BICEP2.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>IF &#8230; IF &#8230;</strong></span></p>
<p>A puzzle that bothered scientists for decades, as to how the observable patch of the universe (i.e. the part that we can actually observe today; the universe may be much, much larger than this &#8212; <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">see here</a>) could be so uniform, would indeed be firmly solved, by a period of <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">cosmic inflation</a>.  The extremely flat geometry of the universe would also now be firmly explained.</p>
<p>We would also have confirmation about how the universe became hot &#8212; about how the Hot Big Bang got started.  The picture would be this: a large amount of <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">dark energy first makes the universe big, via inflation, and then the dark energy turns into energetic particles, making the universe hot (and still expanding, albeit more and more slowly</a> [until <a title="A Nobel Prize That’s No Surprise" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/10/04/a-nobel-prize-thats-no-surprise/" target="_blank">relatively recently</a>]).  Some people like to say that inflation puts the &#8220;Bang&#8221; in &#8220;Big Bang&#8221;, but remember that it also makes the universe flat and uniform and huge (typically much larger than the observable patch) before it heats it up.</p>
<p>The existence of cosmic inflation would itself be another feather in the cap of Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity &#8212; since it is Einstein&#8217;s theory that predicts that the presence of a positive cosmological &#8220;constant&#8221; [not necessarily constant], also known as &#8220;dark `energy&#8217; &#8221; [not really energy, but energy density and negative pressure in just the right combination] actually causes the universe to expand, rather than (as we&#8217;d naively expect from gravity) contract.</p>
<p>And <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">(IF&#8230; IF&#8230;)</span></strong> the confirmation of cosmic inflation would mean that those who pointed it out and its advantages, and developed the idea &#8212; people like Starobinsky, Guth, Steinhardt, Linde &#8212; ought to be able to celebrate (though not all will do so, because they abandoned the idea&#8230;)</p>
<p>Also celebrating would be those who pointed out the possibility of a detectable signal from gravitational waves in the polarization of the CMB, which is what BICEP2 has apparently observed.  I believe these would be Kamionkowsi, Kosowsky, Stebbins, Seljak and Zaldarriaga (but the cosmologists should correct me if I&#8217;m unfair here.)</p>
<p>Were there any doubt left concerning Einstein&#8217;s prediction that gravitational waves exist &#8212; perhaps some leftover worry about the 1993-Nobel-Prize-winning indirect detection of energy carried being off by these waves, via <a href="http://www.astro.cardiff.ac.uk/research/gravity/tutorial/?page=3thehulsetaylor" target="_blank">precision measurements of a pulsar, one of a pair of closely-orbiting neutron stars</a> discovered by Hulse and Taylor &#8212; it would be over.</p>
<p>And if anyone still wasn&#8217;t sure that gravity is due to a spin-two field, not  a spin-zero field, the BICEP2 result would settle the matter; you can&#8217;t get B-mode polarization of the CMB without <a title="A Primer On Today’s Events" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/a-primer-on-todays-events/" target="_blank">combining the spin-two polarization structure of the gravitational waves with Thomson scattering</a>.</p>
<p>If there were any doubt that gravity is controlled, just like everything else, by quantum physics, it would erased; BICEP2&#8217;s observation would imply that just like other fields, which are subject to quantum jitter (i.e., random &#8220;<a title="Quantum Fluctuations and Their Energy" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/quantum-fluctuations-and-their-energy/" target="_blank">fluctuations</a>&#8220;), space and time <em>(somewhat more precisely, the metric that determines distances)</em> undergoes the same type of quantum fluctuations as other fields, fluctuations that <em>any</em> quantum version of Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity would predict.  No details about quantum gravity are needed for this conclusion.</p>
<p><span style="color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">The amount of dark energy required during inflation, in order that BICEP2 could observe this gravitational wave signal, would <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>(IF&#8230; IF&#8230;)</strong></span> be enormous.  The energy scale of dark energy [<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/some-definitions-for-cosmology/" target="_blank">defined here</a>] would be about 10<sup>16</sup> GeV, just about 100 times less than the absolute maximum possible, which is the (reduced) Planck scale.  This need not have been the case!   This energy scale  could have been trillions of times smaller, and yet still given acceptable amounts of inflation of the universe and an acceptable Hot Big BAng.  </span>Amazingly, the dark energy during inflation, if BICEP2 is right, is much larger than it <em>needed</em> to be, and almost as large as it could <em>possibly</em> be!</p>
<p><span style="color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">Moreover, if the energy scale of dark energy [<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/some-definitions-for-cosmology/" target="_blank">defined here</a>] had been just a few times weaker than BICEP2 observes &#8212; 1000 times less than the absolute maximum &#8212; then the gravitational wave signal would have been so faint that it would have been completely drowned out by another process (<a title="A Primer On Today’s Events" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/a-primer-on-todays-events/" target="_blank">lensing of E-mode polarization</a>, the solid red curve on the <a title="BICEP2: New Evidence Of Cosmic Inflation!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/bicep2-new-evidence-of-cosmic-inflation/" target="_blank">first figure here</a>.)  So most of us thought, with this wide range of possibilities, that it was a real long shot that BICEP2, or any future similar experiment, would ever see any signal due to gravitational waves from inflation.  That the gravitational waves would turn out to be large and powerful enough to be observed would be an amazing piece of luck for scientists wanting to understand the universe.  (<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">IF&#8230; IF&#8230;</span></strong>)</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff6600;"><em>[The original version of this paragraph overstated what we&#8217;d know; thanks to my colleagues for pointing out a blunder concerning the heating after inflation.]</em> </span> Also, this would mean we would now have an estimate for how hot the observable patch of the universe could have become <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">after inflation ended and the region containing the observable patch became very hot</a> &#8212; the start of the Hot Big Bang.  The energy scale of the dark energy during inflation determines the maximum possible temperature at the start of the Hot Big Bang, more or less.  To say it another way: after inflation with dark energy of scale 10<sup>16</sup> GeV ended, the universe would have become hot, potentially so hot that the average particle rushing around in the hot dense soup of particles had a motion-energy of 10<sup>16</sup> GeV, though perhaps quite a bit less than this.  That&#8217;s a maximum temperature of as much as 10<sup>29</sup> degrees [yes, that&#8217;s a 1 with 29 zeroes after it!!!]</p>
<p>The Large Hadron Collider&#8217;s data provide direct insights into physics at the energy scale of around 1000 GeV or so.  [The mass-energy mc² of the Higgs particle is 125 GeV.]  The BICEP2 measurement would arguably be our first direct evidence (<span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>IF&#8230; IF&#8230;</strong></span>) concerning physics at higher energy scales than the LHC <em>(though one could argue we have a little information from the existence of neutrino masses.)</em>  And not just a little higher!  Since the scale of the dark energy at inflation is at 10<sup>16</sup> GeV, we&#8217;re talking <strong>10,000,000,000,000 times higher</strong>!!!  We&#8217;ve been trying for years, using various methods, to find evidence concerning how physics works at or near the Planck energy and Planck length.  All previous efforts have come up with nothing; proton decay might have given us insight, but it is too rare if it happens at all; neutrino oscillations haven&#8217;t given a clear pictures; cosmology might have revealed big surprises concerning the Planck energy, but none have previously shown up.  But if BICEP2 is right, then, for the first time, we are seeing phenomena which occurred near this energy scale!</p>
<p>Similarly, data from cosmology has made us very confident that we understand physics in the early universe back to the time when the first <a title="The Nuclei of Atoms: At the Heart of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-nuclei-of-atoms-at-the-heart-of-matter/" target="_blank">atomic nuclei</a> formed during the Hot Big Bang &#8212; a few minutes after the Hot Big Bang started, when the temperature was such that the typical particles had energy of about 0.001 GeV.  And we have had <em>reasonable</em> confidence that we have a decent understanding, using what we&#8217;ve learned about particle physics recently, back to times of a billionth of a second, and temperatures corresponding to an energy of a hundred GeV or so.  But now our understanding may be taking (<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">IF&#8230; IF&#8230;</span></strong>) an enormous leap, back to the very start of the Hot Big Bang, at a temperature corrresponding to an energy of as much as 10<sup>16</sup> GeV, and even earlier, into the frigid inflating universe.</p>
<p>The success of the details of the equations that form the heart of inflationary theory suggests that not only did Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity describe physics at very early times and very high energy scales, the basic principles of quantum field theory worked back then too.  It could easily have been imagined &#8212; and many have imagined, with concrete ideas backed up with equations &#8212; that there might be important principles that we are unaware of, or modifications of the ones we know, that would give very different predictions from standard inflationary theory.  So far, there&#8217;s no sign of that at all.  BICEP2&#8217;s result (<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">IF&#8230; IF&#8230;</span></strong>) would be yet another sign that despite having done all our particle physics and gravity measurements at much lower energy scales and longer distances, those accessible to the LHC and to our previous experiments, we&#8217;ve actually understood the principles that govern the behavior of phenomena at much, much higher energy scales and much shorter distances!</p>
<p>The energy scale inferred from BICEP2&#8217;s measurement, 100 times smaller than the Planck energy &#8212; 10<sup>16</sup> GeV or so &#8212; has appeared in particle physics before!  If you take the three non-gravitational forces of nature &#8212; <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force and the electromagnetic force</a> &#8212; and you first consider <a title="The Known Particles — If The Higgs Field Were Zero" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/the-known-particles-if-the-higgs-field-were-zero/" target="_blank">how they are rearranged when the Higgs field is turned off, into strong nuclear, weak isospin, and hypercharge forces</a> &#8212; and then you look at <a title="The Strengths of the Known Forces" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-forces-of-nature/the-strength-of-the-known-forces/" target="_blank">how the strengths of the forces drift</a> as you study them at shorter and shorter distances and higher and higher energies, you find the forces all become about the same strength at an energy scale of about 10<sup>16</sup> GeV or so.  This is called &#8220;unification of coupling constants&#8221; (i.e. force strengths) &#8212; or, originally and more ambitiously, &#8220;grand unification&#8221;, a grander notion that the three non-gravitational forces are actually manifestations of just one type of force.  <em>[Unification of that unified force with gravity is yet another question; that&#8217;s what string theory might do, though string theory does not require grand unification be a separate process from the unification with gravity.]</em>  Originally, back around 1980, inflation was imagined to be associated with grand unification, and if so, would have an energy scale of about &#8230; yes, 10<sup>16</sup> GeV or so.  But that idea died out long ago as people learned more about both unification and inflation.  Yet now we must wonder: could that part of the original idea, in some vague way, have actually been right?</p>
<p>Over the years, scientists have invented a plethora of variations on how inflation might have, in detail, taken place.  BICEP2&#8217;s observation of a gravitational wave signature would sweep away most of them, leaving just a few.  (More will be invented in coming months, though!)  It also would sweep away some alternatives to inflation and many speculative ideas for how the universe might behave, or might at least have behaved at earlier times.  Despite &#8220;tension&#8221; (meaning mild disagreement) between BICPS2s current data and the Planck satellite&#8217;s data, a rather simple observable patch of universe, with rather simple laws of nature and a rather simple form of inflation, are consistent with what we know.</p>
<p>One of the variants of inflation that would be excluded by BICEP2&#8217;s data is the notion (admittedly long-shot anyway) that actually the Higgs field could play the role of the inflaton after all.   It turns out that no observably large gravitational wave signal would be expected if that were true.</p>
<p>BICEP2&#8217;s result would represent the first time that, without any theoretical speculation about quantum gravity, an experiment has <strong>forced</strong> us to consider processes involving physics at the Planck scale, where quantum gravity is important.  Specifically, for a variant of inflation to give such a large gravitational wave signal <em>relative</em> to the size of the other non-uniformities in the cosmic microwave background, the Planck energy scale becomes important.  The inflaton field, which (by definition) is the field whose stored &#8220;<a title="The Energy That Holds Things Together" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/the-energy-that-holds-things-together/" target="_blank">potential energy</a>&#8221; <strong>is</strong> the dark energy, must change by an amount close to or a bit larger than the Planck energy scale. <em>[Sorry for the necessary technical-speak here. </em><em>This whole business is inherently confusing for non-experts.  The dark energy <strong>may change or may not change at all</strong> while the inflaton field is changing; that&#8217;s a separate question.  What it means for a field like an inflaton to change by the Planck energy scale is that if a particle interacted with the inflaton field as strongly as it possibly could (the way the electron interacts with the Higgs field, but stronger), then as the inflaton field changed by an amount comparable to the Planck energy scale, the particle&#8217;s mass would change by an amount comparable to the Planck mass.]</em></p>
<p>An extremely simple possibility for inflation that would still be consistent with all the data <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">(IF&#8230; IF&#8230;)</span></strong> is just to have a spin-zero field (a bit like the <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">Higgs field</a>, but with important differences &#8212; no weak nuclear force effects, for instance) which has a mass and no substantial interactions with any other fields.  This is a model introduced by Andrei Linde; it&#8217;s amazingly simple.  Could it really be correct?</p>
<p>Among the other very simple ideas that are likely to feature prominently in discussions of the near future are ones involving a &#8220;pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson&#8221;, of a type often called an &#8220;axion&#8221;.  <em>[I wrote a little about this in the paragraph just below the figure within <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/03/26/cosmic-conflation-the-higgs-the-inflaton-and-spin/" target="_blank">this post about the Planck satellite and what it means for variants of inflation.</a>]</em>  One of the variants of inflation that is most consistent with both the Planck satellite and BICEP2  <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>(IF&#8230; IF&#8230;)</strong></span> is an idea called &#8220;natural inflation&#8221;, from 1990, due to Katherine Freese, Joshua Frieman and Angela Olinto.  [Here&#8217;s a <a href="http://ccdb5fs.kek.jp/cgi-bin/img/allpdf?199010350" target="_blank">pdf of the paper</a>.] Such a field has the feature that it is periodic (i.e., if you change it by enough, it comes back to itself, the way an angle that can only range from 0 to 2π.)  It also has the feature that its interactions with all other fields are rather weak.  When this field varies a lot, the dark energy associated with it varies by quite a bit less&#8230; so the field could vary by something approaching the Planck scale yet the energy scale of the dark energy could stay rather constant, at one percent of the Planck energy.</p>
<p>In order for this idea to really be consistent with quantum gravity, it might require some modification, of the sort was introduced in 2008 by Liam McAllister, Eva Silverstein, and Alexander Westphal, in which the axion is periodic with a larger range than you&#8217;d naively expect.  <em>[They did this work in the context of string theory, but I don&#8217;t believe that string theory specifically is necessary for the idea to work; it might work in other consistent quantum gravity theories, if there are any.]  </em>Expect to hear much more about axions.  [By the way, it&#8217;s long been suggested that dark matter itself could be made from a type of axion&#8230; but presumably not the same one&#8230;]</p>

<p>Colleagues: what have I left out?  Eventually this post will be stored on this site as a reference article, so I&#8217;d like to make it complete.</p>
<p><strong>Final Remarks</strong></p>
<p>One more time I must remind you that we&#8217;re still some time away from trusting the BICEP2 result, and quite a long time from trusting the interpretation of the result in terms of inflation.   All of the implications I&#8217;ve mentioned are therefore provisional.   But the list is impressive, and there are probably more I have forgotten to mention, or are known to others but not to me, along with still others that haven&#8217;t yet been noticed by anyone.  So I don&#8217;t yet know if BICEP2&#8217;s measurement is right, or if inflation occurred and if it created the signal they observe, but I do know this: <strong><em>there&#8217;s a lot at stake</em></strong>.</p>
