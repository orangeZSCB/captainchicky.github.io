					<description><![CDATA[Matt,
A few more thoughts. My previous post could be call the Enhanced Big Bounce (EBB) theory. It answers some tough questions and is a suggestion for Anna Ijjas&#039; &quot;We need a new idea&quot; statement. 
1. Insensitive matter (Dark Matter) is preexisting universe matter (pum).
2. There is no antimatter theft as suggested by Janet Conrad. It is not needed to form our universe. (Maybe there is anti-pum matter).
3. The preexisting universe need not be of the same mass as our universe as is required for the Big bounce theory.
4. Our universe is inside the preexisting universe.
5. Pum external to our expanding universe caused the accelerating expansion of our universe. There is no mysterious &quot;Dark Energy&quot;.
6. Stars and galaxies formed earlier than expected.
7. What else?
An interesting implication is that Black Holes are not infinitely small singularities. They have a definite size based on their mass.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Matt,
Thinking about a new idea will be very productive, although it takes a lot of time to piece together what we know and don&#039;t know.
The February 2019 issue of Sky &#038; Telescope indicates that the Big Bang theory is coming under a lot of scrutiny. For me, the biggest issue is missing antimatter which Janet Conrad at MIT said is the greatest theft of all time and the second issue is where &quot;dark matter&quot; (your insensitive particles) came from. 
The only explanation I can come up with is that our universe was formed from the partial collapse of a preexisting universe and that our universe is inside that universe. According to Martin Bojowald&quot;s &quot;Follow the Bouncing Universe&quot; article in the October 2008 issue of Scientific American, if a universe collapses there is a limit as to how much energy a finite amount of space can contain and when it is reached it will bounce into a new universe. 
What he has declined to explain is why the collapsing universe had just the right amount of matter to bounce to form our universe. What is much more probable is that the preexisting universe had much more matter than needed and the bouncing new universe expanded inside the preexisting universe.
The momentum of the excess preexisting universe matter could have caused the Planck length of ordinary matter to be slightly shortened, thus limiting the detection of preexisting universe matter because the wavelengths of most of the radiation would be incompatible and mostly hidden in ordinary matter radiation.
The only way I can think of to detect this radiation is to look for a slight bump in emissions at an even multiple of wavelengths, for example, perhaps every thousand wavelengths if the Planck length was shortened by .999%.
Finally, it seems that the analysis of the subatomic data needs to be influenced by macro understanding of the origin of our universe. This may be why the present search has such limited results because it is influenced by an incorrect Big Bang theory.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;And if youâ€™re a bit unconventional, you might wonder whether particles that are insensitive to all the known forces (except gravity) might have an unexpected role to play in explaining the mysteries of particle physics&quot;

Matt,

It 85% of our universe is made of &quot;insensitive particles&quot; (dark matter) it is highly probable that your statement above is true. If the particles had a slightly longer Planck length than ordinary matter they would be extremely hard to detect.
Anna Ijjas at Harvard said two years ago that we need a new idea, so keep up your quest.]]></description>

the possibility of confirming it as a particle is very low. however once it is confirmed , it is big issue in physics]]></description>
