I&#039;m actually not entirely sure what the status is on nuclei.  I believe there&#039;s been a lot of progress but I have not followed the studies closely enough to know the current situation.  Maybe we can find a review talk on the subject that would explain where things are.  As for &quot;pion exchange&quot;, this is equivalent (under the quark-hadron duality) to quark exchange between protons and neutrons.  The computers can reproduce this phenomenon, but I&#039;m not sure there&#039;s any conceptual picture that comes out of the calculations; it may be that it remains a conceptual mess, and there&#039;s no guarantee that there&#039;s a simplifying view.]]></description>

Thanks for the link to your “QFT, ST and predictions” thread. I notice that in Parts 5 and 6 of that thread you began to discuss how the method of ‘imaginary’ simplification might elucidate the properties of pions and other lightweight mesons. I was hoping that might lead on to consideration of what still seems a great ‘missing link’ in QT, the Residual Strong Nuclear Force, binding protons to neutrons. I’ve read that pions are exchanged, but explanations are vague and/or inconsistent. Computer power has massively increased since 2013, so do you know of any progress in modelling this process? Or, as you candidly cautioned in ‘What holds nuclei together?’, is it still considered too complicated?]]></description>

I don&#039;t think I would even know how to make a tutorial at this point.  In any case I don&#039;t think you need the DAQ info; that you can just accept.  But a key question: if you look at our paper, can you understand why figures 1, 2 and 5 look the way they do, in detail?  If you don&#039;t understand the shapes of those plots, then you are not ready to download any data.  In fact I would spend a lot of time with papers and talks from the LHC and try to make sure you understand all the plots. Maybe just focus on those that involve &quot;dielectron&quot; or &quot;dimuon&quot; [collectively &quot;dilepton&quot;] searches. Only when the fraction of plots that confuse you drops below 25% would I say you were ready to understand what real data passed through an LHC trigger should look like.  In a similar vein, consider https://www.science20.com/quantum_diaries_survivor/blog/atlas_vs_cms_dimuon_resonances-75594: what are all the bumps, what&#039;s between the bumps, why does the &quot;between the bumps&quot; stuff change slope rather than rise smoothly to the left, and so on.]]></description>

Actually, the topological model deserves lots of comment!  Here&#039;s the surprise: it&#039;s equivalent to the quark/gluon picture!!  But this is a highly advanced topic, not easy to explain.  Essentially, one has to translate the math of quarks and gluons into an equivalent math of pions and other hadrons, using a poorly-understood technique called a &quot;duality transformation&quot;.  And if you do that, the proton becomes a topological object built out of pions.  The math behind this transformation seems to be beyond what mathematicians know, so our understanding, while clearly correct, is disappointingly vague.  [I covered just a little of this vast subject in an unfortunately unfinished series of articles, https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/23/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions/ and following posts.  Maybe I&#039;ll have time someday to finish them.]]]></description>

Thanks very much for responding, Matt, and thanks for the two links - very helpful. Surely the problem is not so much that non-experts ‘propagate a wrong image’ but that too many experts (other than yourself!) popularise the three-quark model, presumably in the mistaken belief that the interested public can’t cope with anything more complicated. Just one example of many, from Stephen Hawking’s ‘The Grand Design’: “Protons and neutrons are each composed of three quarks.” 
I’m assuming you think the topological model, which seems to dispense with quarks and gluons altogether, is not even worth commenting on!]]></description>

Thanks Matt.
The trigger system and the whole DAQ thing is actually where I am right now. A tutorial of some sort would definitely be helpful. I certainly can find all answers on my own, it just takes longer. So every help is appreciated.]]></description>
