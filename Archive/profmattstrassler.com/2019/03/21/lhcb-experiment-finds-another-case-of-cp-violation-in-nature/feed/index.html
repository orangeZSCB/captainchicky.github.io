Penrose stairs: Time dilation at eventhorizon is infinity. 
The connection (penrose stairs) between color (yard) and flavour (meter) at HighEnergy with same number was not completly Spontaneous Symmetry Broken - due to blue shift, unlike the red shift (past).

In order to obtain a reliable signature for the presence of DM particles in the galactic halo, it is necessary to follow a suitable model independent approach. In particular, the only DM model independent signature presently feasible is the so-called DM annual modulation signature. For completeness, we also mention a different approach described in the following for the direct detection of DM candidates inducing just nuclear recoils; it is based on the study of the correlation of the nuclear recoil direction with the Earth velocity.]]></description>

Each spin of a singularity (thezeros and ones) at the speed of light is equivalent of the ultimate micro unit of time. This absolute unit of time measurement doesn’t change at all and therefore using it will not lead to time dilation. Time dilation is like changing the length of a given distance due to using the same number of meters (color) and yards (flavour).

According to a thought experiments, the change in local ST curvatures are due to the gravitational Field space particle (FSP) having lower radii than those associated with Vacuum space particle (VSP). This drop (Fluorescence? - gravitational field energy is always negative) in the local SP radii lead to increase in their spinning angular momentum in line with the law Sam= c/(2π r). They assume vector orientations toward the centre of the mass (recoil? - gravitational acceleration is a vector field), hence the formation of the gravitational flux lines. In Doppler effect, the speed of light does not change, only the wavelength. Spinors (vector Stress-energy-tensor) nearer to the centre of the mass would have shorter radii. Photons which accelerate to the central of a large mass would experience blue shift.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Momentum is a particle only at Equivalence principle as p^2 (ball on the spring), violates relativity and Lorentz invariance - unlike QCD flavour parity is like &quot;Penrose stairs&quot;, so violate parity - p^2 = c^2. ?  
If we have knowledge of the statistical distribution of 𝒴i in an hypothetical multiverse where the laws of physics follow our fundamental theory, we can ask how typical are the Yukawa couplings that we observe.

					<description><![CDATA[Always love your blog. My dad was a particle physicist - co-discovered of the muon neutrino - so I follow these things sort of closely. It&#039;s a good result for the Standard Model, which continues to be supported by experimental evidence. See also the recent results from BELLE re: R(D) and R(D*)which also are consistent with SM predictions. I recently published a bio of Enrico Fermi -&quot;The Last Man Who Knew Everything&quot; (Basic Books 2017) and I always wonder what Fermi would make of all this. I think he&#039;d be quite pleased with these incredibly precise experimental results.   All the best David Schwartz   David Schwartz160 W 71st St Apt 12HNew York, NY 10023
