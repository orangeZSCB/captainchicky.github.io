					<description><![CDATA[Matt,

Read the February 2019 Sky &#038; Telescope article &quot;What Came Before the Big Bang? Sentence 4 -  &quot;The Big Bang theory doesn&#039;t rule out the possibility that there was some pre-existing universe from which ours sprang ...&quot;. Remember Alan Guth, he is working on the pre &quot;Big Bang&quot; brain contemplations (sorry, no calculations yet)

So much for the missing antimatter. There was no need for it initially as our universe did not come from nothing, rather from a pre-existing universe. (Now we have shifted the origin problem, &quot;From whence came the pre-existing universe?) 

The problem is the sentence before this sentence. &quot;As you extrapolate our expanding universe backwards, you eventually reach a point of infinite density where the known laws of physics break down,&quot; The consequence of the mathematics (calculations) has caused many to accept the unproven posit - Infinite Density Matter. 

So my goodness, there it is again. Martin Bojowald&#039;s, Lee Smolin&#039;s, and other&#039;s Big Bounce theory. There was no point of infinite density matter. The pre-existing universe contracted until it reached what I call the Bojowald Limit, where space can hold no more energy so the contraction ended and bounced to form our universe.

This is where I came in (not from scratch). 

What is the statistical probability that the pre-existing universe had just the right amount of matter to form our universe with nothing left over?

Compare the above with the statistical probability that there was only a partial collapse of a pre-existing universe.

What conclusion can be reached?

Search the internet for Tequestagrampy Youtube  and click on Tequestagrampy - Youtube. You will find an EBB theory video.

Any comments after watching the brief video.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Matt,
I have done some calculations.
Plot the density of the planets and our moon vs. AU  from the sun. Do this out to Saturn. You will find they all fit quite closely to a curve, except the earth and moon. Their density does not fit the curve.
So I wondered if our sun could capture earth if it were a binary companion of a brown dwarf. I did an incremental 3 body analysis using an Excel spreadsheet. Back in 2006, they only had 65,000 lines. But I proved, mathematically by calculations, that with the right initial conditions our sun will capture our earth from the brown dwarf and the brown dwarf will get a slingshot boost. (I can email the spreadsheet to you).
Colliding with an existing body orbiting the sun only makes it easier.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Matt,

Can we cut through this &quot;did not pay my dues&quot; scenario.

What is implausible about the Enhanced Big Bounce theory as explained some comments ago?

I presented this to a particle physicist several years ago and his comment was &quot;I guess it is possible that our universe is inside a preexisting universe, but how is that going to help me with my calculations?&quot; 

An impartial scientist will evaluate a posit on its merits alone and ignore the emotional side issues, which have nothing to do with the posit,  that you, for instance,  have raised. Perhaps some other readers of this thread could give their evaluation of the EBB posit.

Yes, EBB is a very upending posit, but it does not make it wrong.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Matt,
I did not indicate where I started with EBB so you would conclude I did not start from scratch. Read Martin Bojowald&#039;s October 2008 article in Scientific American &quot;Follow the Bouncing Universe&quot;. He, Lee Smolin and others have proposed similar theories. I think their work centered on Loop Quantum Gravity, spin foam, etc.
Ask yourself about the statistical probability that the preexisting universe had the exact amount of matter needed to bounce and form our universe with no matter left over.
Sometimes it is helpful when looking for a new tree in the forest to come out and examine the entire forest collectively for clues.]]></description>

Thanks for the courteous reply.  I thought I would try, since I think it so important.  Anyways, I look at it as putting the data through a symmetric equation and consider it still to be data.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Matt,
I stand corrected. Analysis of the data is intended to increase our understanding of how the universe works. That has led to creating theories such as the Big Bang and Big Bounce. However, the ultimate end is to make something useful for mankind, such as solar cells to mitigate climate change by understanding the photoelectric effect.
From my previous email it is obvious that I did not make the EBB theory from scratch. I questioned how it was statistically possible for a preexisting universe to have the exact amount of matter needed to collapse and bounce to create our universe (I call this the Bojowald limit). The statistical probability of a partial collapse of a preexisting universe is much higher. This needs no calculation as it is intuitively obvious. This led to the EBB theory where our universe is inside a preexisting universe and ....
As an aside, I did my dues in another way. I received a MSEE from the University of Michigan and founded MMATS Inc. after working for RCA&#039;s computer division for 10 years. I placed the first microcomputer based controller into commercial laundry equipment (a folder for GA Braun), then into washers and then into dryers. I had to gather and analyze a lot of information to design and manufacture them. Also, we took a lot of data from dryers to create an automatic dry cycle. I had to analyze the data to understand what it meant and make a useful algorithm for an auto dry cycle.
At that time, the salesmen questioned why we needed a new method for controlling equipment. Today you can see the results as microcomputers control just about everything.
I would have loved to be a cosmologist or a particle physicist, but I could not see my way financially to accomplish that. Therefore, I had to be satisfied with the next best thing.]]></description>
