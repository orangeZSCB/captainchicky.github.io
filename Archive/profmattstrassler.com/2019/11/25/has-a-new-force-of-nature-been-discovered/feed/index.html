It is analogous to wave functoon collapse. The particle is measured  in this world, as if present in another world (new physics). To be mathematically consistent, it should be renormalized?]]></description>

Neutrinos could represent multiple worlds (new physics) as gauge invariant?
Low energy effective theory that couples a dark scalar to Standard Model neutrinos:
The large components are gauge invariant, while the small components are not. These small components represent spin- non-zero-mass particles. If we renormalize the large components, these gauge invariant spinors represent the polarization of neutrinos. Massive neutrinos cannot be invariant under gauge transformations.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Speaking of forces, would it be possible for you to do a write up on what the (electro)weak and Higgs forces would look like if their corresponding bosons had masses low enough for them to have ranges on macroscopic scales (in other words, if they were long ranged enough to behave as classical forces), and what the strong force would look like if the confinement scale were macroscopic? I&#039;m thinking both in terms of what the field and radio frequency waves within the field would look like (e.g, how does a charged W or gluon affect the picture we&#039;re used to with classical electromagnetism, in terms of how field lines are arranged, how waves behave, etc.) and in terms of optics (if, in such a scenario, our eyes picked up electroweak bosons or gluons or Higgses, how would the world look to us, assuming that the new physics still allowed for structures vaguely equivalent to eyes and brains?).

I have similar questions about fermionic fields. Can one have a classical(ish) field that behaves in a fermionic way? Can we formulate the muon field in terms of &quot;muonelectric&quot; and &quot;muonmagnetic&quot; field lines (I&#039;d ask that question in terms of the electron, but it would cause obvious linguistic difficulties)? If so,  how would it compare to the familiar electromagnetic case?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It would seem that the main difference between the Higgs boson and X17 is that the former served as evidence of a long proposed and mathematically supported phenomenon (the Higgs mechanism).  In other words, there was already a well established basis for its existence.  Stumbling upon something that appears to be evidence, but without any prior theoretical justification, is like putting the wagon before the horse.  Like Matt&#039;s example of a &quot;new neutrino&quot;, it seems a bit dodgy and should be proceeded with a healthy dose of skepticism.]]></description>
