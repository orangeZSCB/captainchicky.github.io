There saids that only NS produces heavy elements, but really there is not enough material on it to produce all of the galaxy and the universe&#039;s heavy masses, and no internally blow up and no material around is there to produce such elements. This well-accepted theory of Dr Metzger does not explain the existence of heavy elements from the entire universe, as there are an tiny fraction existence of NS in the universe, which they are rare and not all itself collides and they can not supply the entire universe on heavy material. And lastly, if the NS gravity is close to BH gravity, how can internal material escape, even under explosions. This Metzger theory is contradictory. Also, if NS is internal formed only by neutrons, how can it create different elements. Please we ask to explain this further, as high energy cases are your studies, despite being astrophysical area. thanks. reference bellow]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Prof Matt, we have some questions about an recent discoveries, if you can help please, in articles that you also published: thats are theorized by the discovery of LIGO&#039;s gravitational waves, from Neutron Stars, that heavy elements could only be created by such collisions between NS, where there is a lot of failure on it, because collisions are very rare, would not even fill the immense amount of heavy elements in the universe at all, much less in the huge galaxy-equivalent nebulae, in addition that NS masses are being very small, equivalent to the Sun (90% of Supernova mass would explode on elements and result only 10% for NS core), and dont forgetting that a minimal fraction would be lost on energy (no chemical elements would been also created, but mostly Neutrino radiation), never yielding any good amount of chemical elements.contines..]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am 100% in agreement with you on your one beef with the Times article.  There is a disturbing trend in the media nowadays to over emphasize gender.  This is sadly ironic, since media &quot;pundits&quot; are attempting to achieve gender equality through such identifications, somehow failing to realize that true gender equality can only be achieved when gender no longer matters.  

This is a terrible loss to the physics community, and in Ann&#039;s case a terrible personal loss to you.  I am very sorry, Matt.  May Steve and Ann rest in peace.]]></description>
