					<description><![CDATA[Indeed, a dark day for us all...that it should arise from such similar events is difficult to believe. I would like to take a moment away from that sorrow to extend my my thanks - broadly - to all such who invest thier whole lives (typically) to expanding the frontiers of human knowledge of this astonishing thing we all live in and experience daily, the Universe.
I would also like to thank Dr Strassler specifically for devoting so much of his time to explaining (patiently!) so many aspects of the larger World to those of us without the background to ferret our way through the minutae which always accompanies deep Physics in general. Your time and efforts are sincerely appreciated by many I&#039;m sure, as well myself distinctly.]]></description>

What an idiotic saying. Did the man have the slightest iota of proof for it? How many theories have risen in just our generation? Did all of cosmology die off in the 90s so the theory of dark energy could spread? Dark matter before it? Quarks before that? Foolishness.]]></description>

Insensitive maybe, but crazy? Ann Nelson risked quite a lot given her advanced age (61)... https://www.peakbagger.com/climber/PeakListC.aspx?cid=15035&#038;sort=prom&#038;u=m&#038;pt=prom]]></description>
