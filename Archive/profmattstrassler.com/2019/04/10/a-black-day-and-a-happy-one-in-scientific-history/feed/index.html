Perfect Dr Matt. But lets watch hers beatiful explanation about it on youtube &quot;How to take a picture of a black hole  Katie Bouman&quot; (this subject will still give much comment on the world, for many time, incredible disclosure)]]></description>

The black hole will pass right through the star unless the relative velocities are very slow and the black hole manages to eat a substantial amount of material going through.  Only in those very rare circumstances will it stay within the star. In that case it will eventually  eat the star, but the rate at which it does so can be very slow, and depends very greatly on how small or large it is.  So there is no simple answer.  There is some relevant discussion and references in Giddings and Mangano from maybe 2008.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A great article, thanks !

Somewhat off topic (sorry !) ;
any idea if a very small black hole (via Hawking radiation ?) 
in collision with, say, a much larger star, would eventually 
consume the star ?]]></description>

I do not think there will be a Nobel prize for this photo, but if there were to be one, it would go to people who many years ago pointed out that this method would be possible.  Dr. Bouman&#039;s work is commendable, but in the media&#039;s rush to create heroes and heroines, she is being given too much credit right now (as she herself has stated) for the collective work of 200 people.  You can only make an image based on data --- and someone has to collect that data, which is only possible with an extraordinary level of effort and cleverness by people whose names have not even been mentioned.]]></description>

Nobel and Fields Medal to Katie Bouman that develop the algorithms that made the full black hole image possible. A genius]]></description>

The black hole in question is over a billion miles across and has been further magnified by lensing.  Your intuition is wrong   

The plasma jets may not be visible for several possible reasons. I don&#039;t know which is the cause and I&#039;m not sure the scientists do either, yet. But I will try to find out.]]></description>
