					<description><![CDATA[the important thing about Black holes, is its spin &#038; Mass.
Most massive black holes appear to have spins close to the speed of light.
If this is the case, a point comes when the black hole can no longer get any bigger. ??? What happens to the matter falling into the black hole then. ???]]></description>

Caution is merited, but I&#039;m reasonably convinced of the basic story -- by the facts that (a) the size of the dark patch is very close in radius to what was expected in advance from the larger of the two measurements of the M87 black hole&#039;s mass, and (b) the continuous ring seen is consistent with the photosphere of a black hole rotating with its rotation axis pointing at or away from us, as was expected in advance from the jets that are observed to originate from the center of M87.  If the image was a statistical effect, it would be very surprising for the result to satisfy both of these expectations.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I guess we need to find more BHs and converge to the common factors that will eventually define it to a level we can get consensus.

One thing you didn&#039;t mention in your article is dark matter (dark energy). What effect, if any, would dark matter around the galaxy have on the BH?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have no experience whatsoever in radioastronomy or any of the relevant fields of physics. However, I studied and worked in the area of electrical engineering and signal processing (audio and images). So some grains of salt advised...

My gut feeling (without looking into any of the papers published) is that the resolution of the M87 &quot;image&quot; is simply way too low to reconcile our (as of now limited) understanding and models of the black hole physics with the reality of M87. 

The &quot;handful of pixels&quot; is not anywhere near &quot;5 sigma&quot; (without knowing much about the later). I might be doing grave injustice to the good people involved in this research, but to me it feels like the equivalent of going over the Zapruder film... Yeah, some of the interpretations might be close to reality, while others are less so. We need better radiotelescopes (e.g. a space based component the EHT) to achieve better resolution, until then this seems to me to be a bit like an exercise in tealeaf reading.]]></description>
