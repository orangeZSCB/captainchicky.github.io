0^2  ≠ 0 = unitarity because, there is time difference, massless get angular momentum at speed c. But 0^4 at equivalence principle has time-lapse, appear a relative mass as rest mass. So singularity (0^+n) is a red shift (bent spoon or length contraction) or space expansion (0^-n) ?]]></description>

I did not say &quot;there is no singularity there&quot; as a statement of fact; I said &quot;there is probably no singularity there&quot;, an opinion I can defend, and therefore my remark was not in violation of your complaint.  You put words in my mouth.

A quantum theory of gravity is not general relativity; and if we agree that general relativity must be modified in any way (such as allowing the stress tensor to be an operator instead of a c-number) then we already agree that this cannot be not Einstein&#039;s theory.  If the metric or the curvature are operators (or at least not c-numbers) then the infinities we understand geometrically as singularities are automatically modified.  Note also that electrodynamics and QCD are obtained in compactifications of general relativity, and in both of them (1) crucial singularities are removed by quantum theory, and (2) the quantum theory is qualitiatively different from the classical theory, to the extent that the classical theory gives very poor intuition in many regimes.

I do know something about this subject; my two most famous papers from the early 2000s involve the resolution of singularities in semi-classical [not classical!] gravity.  I am not the world&#039;s expert on quantum gravity, but neither am I uninformed.]]></description>

Relativistic Mass  m=E/c2=hc/λ 
No Ultraviolet catastrophe (termination of geodesic). So no rest mass (GR&#039;s particle), only relativistic mass inferred by neutrino oscillation. This information is not localized ( violation of relativity). So The left spoon&#039;s blue shift does not show the bend ?]]></description>
