					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/04/16/the-black-hole-photo-seeing-more-clearly/#comment-396028&quot;&gt;Walter Bachmeister (@WBachmeister)&lt;/a&gt;.

The interaction of black holes with matter is a complex and subtle thing.

The first issue is QM itself; if the universe were continuous we might well expect mass falling into a black hole to constantly be emitting energy from our POV. But the fact that photons are discrete puts some severe limits on this. The time dilation we &#039;see&#039; increases exponentially over time (from our POV.) and rapidly becomes near infinite.

Given the emission rate of a body it&#039;s not hard to calculate that if we start timing when time dilation is less than 10% then after around  second from our POV, for stellar mass black hole (A bit longer for a supermassive one.) it&#039;s far more likely than 50-50 that we&#039;ve seen the last photon the body emitted before it fell below the horizon. (That is to say an infalling body not only emits less energy from our perspective but also less photons per second to the point where even given the massive number of photons something like a lightbulb emits this can be rapidly slowed to essentially zero.)

The second issue is that the classic &#039;object seems to sit at the horizon forever&#039; scenario only works in one, single, very specific and actually impossible situation: It&#039;s true from the point of an observer infinitely far from a hole that does not ever grow or shrink.

To see this you can imagine a body falling into the hole and leaving a &#039;trail&#039; of photons behind that are slowly escaping due to time dilation and whatnot. We can imagine the &#039;last photons&#039; being right near the edge of the hole almost &#039;held in place&#039;.

If the hole gains mass from another infalling body, or even just feeding off the Cosmic Microwave Background it will expand outwards, the growing horizon &#039;swallowing&#039; those last photons. We&#039;d see the hole grow to encompass the first object. On the other hand if the hole shrinks due to emitting Hawking Radiation the time dilation at the point in space where the last photons are will lessen and they will be emitted at a time less than infinity, letting us see the object fall into the hole. If we approach the hole we&#039;ll run into photons trying to escape it as well as experience time dilation and see the objects fall speed up. (To the point that, if we go to where we think the object is it&#039;ll always fall away from us right up until we ourselves meet the horizon.)

There&#039;s even an interesting effect with what you&#039;ll see with a single body falling into the hole.We generally imagine it going darker and redder but remaining unchanged; this is inaccurate. Imagine a glowing sphere falling towards the hole, emitting light in all directions.

In normal space you can see half the sphere&#039;s surface; a collection of points where you can draw a straight line between the sphere&#039;s surface and your eyes. But as the sphere gets closer to the hole light rays bend. The first effect is that the side of the sphere nearest the hole is more time dilated so moves more slowly from our POV... so the far side will fall onto it; the sphere will look like it&#039;s flattening out into a disc.

Now at the &#039;photon sphere&#039; 1.5x the event horizon away light can orbit the hole; light from the side of the sphere can move right around the hole and hit the opposite side. (If you were there you could see the back of your own head in front of you.) But light from other angles will also be warped; light not heading directly for you (or rather away from the hole) will be increasingly bent. Photons that might have been 1 degree off will  become 2, 4,8..90... 360... as the object nears the hole it will seem to spread out until it eventually seems to cover the hole&#039;s entire surface. (At any distance there will be some light sent close to the hole, bent around and sent back, meaning that at any time you should be able to see a distorted view of an object falling towards a black hole in the &#039;light ring&#039; like that seen in the black hole photo discussed here.)

The end result of this is that only the most recent object to approach a black hole will be visible and it will cover the whole horizon, any newer object will &#039;encase&#039; any older ones and from observations of the hole it can be calculated that previous bodies will now reside inside the event horizon.

As a side note this also limits the ultra-redshifted light; only light emitted directly away from the hole near the horizon can escape, any with sideways motion will be bent inwards and absorbed. The amount of light that can escape is 50% at the photon sphere (1.5R, where time dilation is essentially zero.) and rapidly shrinks to nothing the closer the object gets to the horizon. So only the last object counts, it has a finite number of photons it can release and essentially zero of them can even theoretically escape near the horizon.

Now as for a falling body&#039;s view, it should notice no difference and fall past the event horizon in a relatively short and calculable period of time. Why doesn&#039;t the hole seem to evaporate away before it reaches it? The trick is that the falling body is different from the light it emits.

We see the last photons emitted by an infalling body and note that they&#039;re very time dilated, nearly infinitely so. And indeed, if we were discussing a body moving away from the black hole at light speed from just above its horizon, a significant amount of evaporation could be expected to occur before that body could escape the hole and reach our eyes.

But the actual body that emitted those photons is moving inwards, blueshifting the black hole. At the horizon it&#039;s falling in at light speed (even if massive.) and this essentially cancels things out.

As for what&#039;s beyond the horizon, who knows? I doubt singularities are a thing; we get one when we let relativity&#039;s math run until the theory breaks down, but that&#039;s hardly proof. If I get a nonsense result my first instinct isn&#039;t that nonsense must be right but that my math is incomplete. Whenever we&#039;ve had singularities or infinities in the past (Such as, say, the Ultraviolet Catastrophe) we&#039;ve eventually found a bigger, better theory that avoids them. I suspect black holes are the same.]]></description>

You are right, I have to take back my &quot;QM in a nutshell&quot; sentence.
As far as I know when Heisenberg was on Helgoland, he was led by his intuition that the laws of physics must be based on what can be observed. This is what I had in mind, when I wrote that comment. But I was mixing things up. It could be that there is hyper-redshifted light, even if there exists no structure in the universe to detect these photons.

Concerning the amount of stuff, that could be the source of some escaping photons: I think everything that has started its journey towards the black hole is still on its way from our distant observer point of view. Because of time dilation we never can observe anything reach the &quot;event horizon&quot; in finite time. Assuming we could detect ultra-low-energy photons and assuming we are willing to wait for eons.

(And from the infalling particles point of view: Shouldn&#039;t the black hole evaporate before the particle can reach the event horizon? I prefer to think that there is no singularity and no place &quot;beyond&quot; a horizon.)]]></description>

The coordinates of different events (light cone) inside equivalence principle is same because the &quot;bend or time difference (Dirac ball on spring)&quot; which creates mass, again come inside the event as particle. It is like the geodesic on surface of earth. If the &quot;bend&quot; coudn&#039;t go to the future or Past, no time and no particle (black hole?). Blue shift cannot become red shift or &quot;make a bend&quot; in another space into spacetime. ??]]></description>
