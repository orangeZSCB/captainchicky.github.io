					<description><![CDATA[In the long and careful process of restarting the Large Hadron Collider [LHC] after its two-year nap for upgrades and repairs, another milestone has been reached: protons have once again collided inside the LHC&#8217;s experimental detectors (named ATLAS, CMS, LHCb and &#8230; <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2015/05/06/lhc-starts-collisions-and-a-radio-interview-tonight/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the long and careful process of restarting the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC] after its two-year nap for upgrades and repairs, another milestone has been reached: <a href="http://home.web.cern.ch/about/updates/2015/05/low-energy-collisions-tune-lhc-experiments">protons have once again collided inside the LHC&#8217;s experimental detectors</a> (named ATLAS, CMS, LHCb and ALICE). This is good news, but don&#8217;t get excited yet. It&#8217;s just one small step. These are collisions at the lowest energy at which the LHC operates (450 GeV per proton, to be compared with the 4000 GeV per proton in 2012 and the 6500 GeV per proton they&#8217;ve already achieved in the last month, though in non-colliding beams.) Also the number of protons in the beams, and the number of collisions per second, is still very, very small compared to what will be needed. So discoveries are not imminent!  Yesterday&#8217;s milestone was just one of the many little tests that are made to assure that the LHC is properly set up and ready for the first full-energy collisions, which should start in about a month.</p>
<p>But since full-energy collisions are on the horizon, why not listen to a radio show about what the LHC will be doing after its restart is complete? Today (Wednesday May 6th), <a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/virtually-speaking-science">Virtually Speaking Science</a>, on which I have appeared a couple of times before, will run a program at 5 pm Pacific time (8 pm Eastern). Science writer Alan Boyle will be interviewing me about the LHC&#8217;s plans for the next few months and the coming years. You can listen live, or listen later once they post it.  <a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/virtually-speaking-science/2015/05/07/alan-boyle-matt-strassler-large-hadron-collider">Here&#8217;s the link for the program.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m a few days behind (thanks to an NSF grant proposal that had to be finished last week) but I wanted to write a bit more about <a title="Day 2 At CERN" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/11/12/day-2-at-cern/">my visit to CERN</a>, which concluded Nov. 21st in a whirlwind of activity. I was working full tilt on timely issues related to Run 2 of the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC], currently scheduled to start early next May.   (You may recall the LHC has been shut down for repairs and upgrades since the end of 2012.)</p>
<p>A certain fraction of my time for the last decade has been taken up by concerns about the LHC experiments&#8217; ability to observe new long-lived particles, specifically ones that aren&#8217;t affected by <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/">the electromagnetic or strong nuclear forces</a>. (Long-lived particles that <em>are</em> affected by those forces are easier to search for, and are much more constrained by the LHC experiments.  More about them some other time.)</p>
<p>This subject is important to me because it is a classic example of how <a title="The Trigger: Discarding All But the Gold" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/the-trigger-discarding-all-but-the-gold/">the trigger systems</a> at LHC experiments could fail us &#8212; whereby a spectacular signal of a new phenomena could be discarded and lost in the very process of taking and storing the data! If no one thinks carefully about the challenges of finding long-lived particles in advance of running the LHC, we can end up losing a huge opportunity, unnecessarily. Fortunately some of us are thinking about it, but we are small in number. It is an uphill battle for those experimenters within ATLAS and CMS [the two general purpose experiments at the LHC] who are working hard to make sure they have the required triggers available. I can&#8217;t tell you how many times people within the experiments &#8212; even at <a title="At the Naturalness 2014 Conference" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/11/17/at-the-naturalness-2014-conference/">the Naturalness conference</a> I wrote about recently &#8212; have told me &#8220;such efforts are hopeless&#8221;&#8230; despite the fact that their own experiments have actually shown, already in public and in some cases published measurements (including <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1203.1303">this</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1411.6977">this</a>, <a href="http://cds.cern.ch/record/1740972/files/ATLAS-CONF-2014-041.pdf">this</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1411.6530">this</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1409.0746">this</a>, and <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1409.4789">this</a>), that it is not. Conversely, many completely practical searches for long-lived particles have not been carried out, often because there was no trigger strategy able to capture them, or because, despite the events having been recorded, no one at ATLAS or CMS has had time or energy to actually search through their data for this signal.</p>
<p>Now what is meant by &#8220;long-lived particles&#8221;?<span id="more-7789"></span></p>
<p><a title="Most Particles Decay — But Why?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/why-do-particles-decay/most-particles-decay-why/">Most types of particles decay</a> (i.e., disintegrate into lower-mass particles). Any particular <em>type</em> of particle has an <em>average</em> lifetime, though an <strong>individual</strong> one may live a <strong>longer or shorter</strong> life than the average.  A <a title="The Nuclei of Atoms: At the Heart of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-nuclei-of-atoms-at-the-heart-of-matter/">neutron</a>, if found outside a stable <a title="The Nuclei of Atoms: At the Heart of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-nuclei-of-atoms-at-the-heart-of-matter/">atomic nucleus</a>, decays into a proton, and electron and an anti-neutrino after about 15 minutes&#8230; sometimes shorter, sometimes longer, but 15 minutes on average.</p>
<p>In the context of the LHC, the term &#8220;long-lived particle&#8221; doesn&#8217;t mean a particle will outlast you and me! or even a neutron.  It merely that its average lifetime is long enough that, if traveling at a good fraction of the speed of light, it is likely to move a measurable distance before it decays&#8230; i.e. that it lives a <em>trillionth of a second</em> or longer. The ATLAS and CMS experiments, despite being the size of small office buildings, are able to detect when a particle&#8217;s decay occurs a millimeter (about 1/25 of an inch) away, or even less, from the location of the proton-proton collision where it was created. <em>(Pretty amazing, huh? My experimental colleagues are awesome.)</em> This astounding ability is critical in identifying bottom and charm quarks, which often decay at a location separated from the collision point by as little as a millimeter.</p>
<p>In contrast to a neutron, the <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/">Higgs particle</a> which was <a title="Discovery of the Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-discovery-of-the-higgs/">discovered at ATLAS and CMS</a> in 2012 is very short-lived; a typical Higgs particle, from its birth to its death at the LHC, <strong><em>won&#8217;t even travel an atom&#8217;s width</em></strong> from the location at which it was created, living about a billionth of a trillionth of a second. But there are other known particles that are much longer lived, such as the muon. A muon, once produced, will survive for two millionths of a second on average &#8212; during which, if it is traveling at a good fraction of the speed of light*, it can travel a good fraction of a mile.</p>
<p>*<span style="color:#808080;"><em>Due to time dilation, a consequence of relativity à la Einstein, if the muon is traveling very close to the speed of light relative to us, it will actually, from our point of view, live longer and travel further than average. This is why very high energy muons created in cosmic ray collisions high in the atmosphere often are able to travel hundreds of miles, often <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttjkd_E7-58">reaching the Earth&#8217;s surface</a>.</em></span></p>
<p>But the really important question for the LHC is whether it might be able to produce <em>as-yet unknown</em> particles that have long lifetimes. We haven&#8217;t found a long-lived particle for a while &#8212; the bottom quark was the most recently discovered long-lived elementary particle, and that was about 40 years ago &#8212; but we found many before, and why shouldn&#8217;t there be others? Indeed such particles are predicted, with small to moderate certainty, in various speculations that have been considered by theorists over the years, including some creative ideas about the nature of dark matter, certain forms of <a title="Supersymmetry — What Is It?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/supersymmetry-what-is-it/">supersymmetry</a>, various attempts to understand the masses of <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/">the known particles</a>, etc. What got me interested in the problem, back in 2001 or so, is that I noticed that if one takes a broad view, and considers a wider set of variants of these speculative ideas, one quickly sees that <em>long-lived particles are far more common than they are in the most popular variants of these ideas</em>. (After some intermittent research, this observation was finally published in <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0604261">2006 work with Kathryn Zurek</a>.)</p>
<p>In other words, <em>due to cultural biases among scientists, but not due to anything about nature itself, the possibility of long-lived particles was viewed as far more remote than it really is</em>. (Though the biases have improved since 2006, to a certain extent they still remain.) And for this reason, the LHC experiments, as of 2006, had prepared for only a fraction of the possibilities, and were even lacking trigger strategies that could be sensitive to certain types of long-lived particles. The worry was especially acute if the long-lived particles were created mainly in the decays of a lightweight Higgs particle. A Higgs particle of mass 125 GeV/c², such as the one we have in nature, has such low mass-energy (125 GeV) compared to the energy of LHC proton-on-proton collisions (7000 GeV in 2011, 8000 GeV in 2012, and 13,000 GeV starting in 2015) that its decays are generally unspectacular and are difficult to observe; the 2012 discovery of the Higgs required careful trigger design, and this will become even more important for Higgs studies in Run 2. So I have spent a lot of time since 2007 trying to help change the situation, so that we can be sure that, if such particles exist, we will discover them, and if we don&#8217;t find them, we&#8217;ll be confident we did a thorough search and didn&#8217;t just miss one for lack of trying.  To this end, I spent much of my time at CERN giving talks and having extended conversations, both planned and spontaneous, with experimental colleagues at ATLAS and CMS, and discussing the issues with theorist colleagues as well.</p>
<p>I realize this is a bit abstract, so in a day or two I&#8217;ll give you a more detailed example of how a new trigger strategy can be crucial in allowing for the possibility of a discovery of long-lived particles.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Day 2 of my visit to CERN (host laboratory of the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC]) was a pretty typical CERN day for me. Here&#8217;s a rough sketch of how it panned out:</p>
<ul>
<li>1000: after a few chores, arrived at CERN by tram. Worked on my ongoing research project #1. Answered an email about my ongoing research project #2.</li>
<li>1100: attended a one hour talk, much of it historical, by Chris Quigg, one of the famous experts on &#8220;quarkonium&#8221; (atom-like objects made from a quark or anti-quark, generally referring specifically to charm and bottom quarks). Charmonium (charm quark/antiquark atoms) was discovered 40 years ago this week, in two very different experiments.</li>
<li>1200: Started work on the talk that I am giving on the afternoon of Day 3 to some experimentalists who work at ATLAS. <em>[ATLAS and CMS are the two general-purpose experimental detectors at the LHC; they were used to <a title="Discovery of the Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-discovery-of-the-higgs/" target="_blank">discover the Higgs particle</a>.]</em> It involves some new insights concerning the search for long-lived particles <em>(hypothesized types of new particles that would typically <a title="Most Particles Decay — But Why?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/why-do-particles-decay/most-particles-decay-why/" target="_blank">decay</a> only after having traveled a distance of at least a millimeter, and possibly a meter or more, before they decay to other particles.)</em></li>
<li>1230: Working lunch with an experimentalist from ATLAS and another theorist, mainly discussing <a title="The Trigger: Discarding All But the Gold" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/the-trigger-discarding-all-but-the-gold/" target="_blank">triggering</a>, and other related issues, concerning long-lived particles. Learned a lot about the new opportunities that ATLAS will have starting in 2015.</li>
<li>1400: In an extended discussion with two other theorists, got a partial answer to a subtle question that arose in my research project #2.</li>
<li>1415: Sent an email to my collaborators on research project #2.</li>
<li>1430: Back to work on my talk for Day 3. Reading some relevant papers, drawing some illustrations, etc.</li>
<li>1600: Two-hour conversation over coffee with an experimentalist from CMS, yet again about triggering, regarding long-lived particles, exotic decays of the Higgs particle, and both at once. Learned a lot of important things about CMS&#8217;s plans for the near-term and medium-term future, as well as some of the subtle issues with collecting and analyzing data that are likely to arise in 2015, when the LHC begins running again.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>[Why triggering, triggering, triggering? Because if you don&#8217;t collect the data in the first place, you can&#8217;t analyze it later!  We have to be working on triggering in 2014-2015 before the LHC takes data again in 2015-2018]</em></p>
<ul>
<li>1800: An hour to work on the talk again.</li>
<li>1915: Skype conversation with two of my collaborators in research project #1, about a difficult challenge which had been troubling me for over a week. Subtle theoretical issues and heavy duty discussion, but worth it in the end; most of the issues look like they may be resolvable.</li>
<li>2100: Noticed the time and that I hadn&#8217;t eaten dinner yet. Went to the CERN cafeteria and ate dinner while answering emails.</li>
<li>2130: More work on the talk for Day 3.</li>
<li>2230: Left CERN. Wrote blog post on the tram to the hotel.</li>
<li>2300: Went back to work in my hotel room.</li>
</ul>
<p>Day 1 was similarly busy and informative, but had the added feature that I hadn&#8217;t slept since the previous day. (I never seem to sleep on overnight flights.) Day 3 is likely to be as busy as Day 2. I&#8217;ll be leaving Geneva before dawn on Day 4, heading to a conference.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a hectic schedule, but I&#8217;m learning many things!  And if I can help make these huge and crucial experiments more powerful, and give my colleagues a greater chance of a discovery and a reduced chance of missing one, it will all be worth it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a couple of months of hard work on grant writing, career plans and scientific research, I&#8217;ve made it back to my blogging keyboard.  I&#8217;m on my way to Switzerland for a couple of weeks in Europe, spending much of the time at the <a href="http://home.web.cern.ch/" target="_blank">CERN laboratory</a>. CERN, of course, is the host of the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC], where the <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">Higgs particle</a> was discovered in 2012. I&#8217;ll be consulting with my experimentalist and theorist colleagues there&#8230; I have many questions for them. And I hope they&#8217;ll have many questions for me too, both ones I can answer and others that will force me to go off and think for a while.</p>
<p>You may recall that the LHC was turned off (as planned) in early 2013 for repairs and an upgrade. Run 2 of the LHC will start next year, with <a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/" target="_blank">protons</a> colliding at an energy of around 13 <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/" target="_blank">TeV</a> per collision. This is larger than in Run 1, which saw 7 TeV per collision in 2011 and 8 TeV in 2012.  This increases the probability that a proton-proton collision will make a Higgs particle, which has a mass of 125 GeV/c², by about a factor of 2 ½.  <em>(Don&#8217;t try to figure that out in your head; the calculation requires detailed knowledge of <a title="Checking What’s Inside a Proton" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/checking-whats-inside-a-proton/">what&#8217;s inside a proton</a>.)</em> The number of proton-proton collisions per second will also be larger in Run 2 than in Run 1, though not immediately. In fact I would not be surprised if 2015 is mostly spent addressing unexpected challenges. But Run 1 was a classic: a small pilot run in 2010 led to rapid advances in 2011 and performance beyond expectations in 2012. It&#8217;s quite common for these machines to underperform at first, because of unforeseen issues, and outperform in the long run, as those issues are solved and human ingenuity has time to play a role. All of which is merely to say that I would view any really useful results in 2015 as a bonus; my focus is on 2016-2018.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it a bit early to be thinking about 2016? No, now is the time to be thinking about 2016 <a title="The Trigger: Discarding All But the Gold" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/the-trigger-discarding-all-but-the-gold/">triggering challenges</a> for certain types of difficult-to-observe phenomena. These include <a title="Non-Standard Decays of the Observed Higgs Particle" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/non-standard-decays-of-the-observed-higgs-particle/" target="_blank">exotic, unexpected decays of the Higgs particle</a>, or other hard-to-observe types of Higgs particles that might exist and be lurking in the LHC&#8217;s data, or rare decays of the <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">W and Z particle</a>, and more generally, anything that involves a particle whose (rest) mass is in the 100 <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/" target="_blank">GeV</a>/c² range, and whose mass-energy is therefore less than a percent of the overall proton-proton collision energy. The higher the collision energy grows, the harder it becomes to study relatively low-energy processes, even though we make more of them. To be able to examine them thoroughly and potentially discover something out of place &#8212; something that could reveal a secret worth even more than the Higgs particle itself &#8212; we have to become more and more clever, open-minded and vigilant.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have to admit that this post is really only important for experimentalists interested in searching for <a title="Unexpected Decays of the Higgs Particle: What We Found" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/02/11/non-standard-model-higgs-particle-decays-what-we-found/">non-Standard Model decays of the Higgs particle</a>.  I try to keep these technical posts very rare, but this time I do need to slightly amend a technical point that I made in an article a few weeks ago.<span id="more-7376"></span></p>
<p>Recently <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/non-standard-decays-of-the-observed-higgs-particle/higgs-decay-to-unknown-spin-one-particles/" target="_blank">I wrote an article</a> on this website, which I briefly described <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/02/19/could-the-higgs-decay-to-new-z-like-particles/" target="_blank">in this post</a>, about the possibility that the Higgs particle might decay to two new spin-one particles (which I called a &#8220;Z<sub>D</sub>&#8220;), each of which could then decay to a lepton-antilepton pair. Based on <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4992" target="_blank">my recent paper</a> with twelve other authors about the possibility of <a title="Lightweight Higgs: A `Sensitive Creature’" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/lightweight-higgs-a-sensitive-creature/" target="_blank">unexpected (&#8220;exotic&#8221;) decays of the Higgs particle</a>, I argued that this could be discovered with existing LHC data from 2011-2012, even if it only happens in one in every 100,000 Higgs particles.</p>
<p>All of that is correct. But in the second-to-last paragraph of <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/non-standard-decays-of-the-observed-higgs-particle/higgs-decay-to-unknown-spin-one-particles/" target="_blank">that article</a>, I also briefly noted a different variant of this possibility: that the Higgs might occasionally decay to a (known) Z particle plus an (unknown) <em>Z<sub>D</sub></em> particle. For this possibility, I said something which my co-authors and I now think is not correct &#8212; and once corrected, <strong><em>a search for this process becomes even more pressing and interesting</em>.</strong></p>
<p>I said: &#8220;However, there are indirect limits on h → Z <em>Z<sub>D</sub></em> from electroweak precision measurements, and these are still a few times stronger than any limits that likely can be obtained from measurements using current LHC data. Only with future data will such a search become competitive with the indirect limits.&#8221; But while we were soliciting comments before submitting our paper, one of our colleagues pointed out an issue with one of the articles on which we relied in determining the electroweak precision-based limits. Revisiting these limits, <em>we now find the true electroweak precision limits are somewhat weaker than we had inferred</em>, which is relevant for a Z<sub>D</sub> with mass above about 10 GeV/c². <span style="color:#ff0000;">As a result, it <strong>is</strong> in fact possible, contrary to what I said last month, for measurements on the 2011-2012 LHC data looking for Higgs decaying to Z + Z<sub>D</sub> to show a signal, or to put stronger limits than any existing precision measurements.  <span style="color:#000000;">So please go make the measurement on current data!</span></span></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve adjusted the wording of my website article accordingly, and version 2 of our paper, with this adjustment, will be on the arXiv within a few days.</p>

<p>You might wonder how particle physicists could have missed a particle with a mass lower than that of the Z particle; wouldn&#8217;t we already have observed it? A clue as to how this can occur: it took much longer to discover the muon neutrino than the muon, even though the neutrino has a much lower mass. Similarly, it took much longer to discover the Higgs particle than the top quark, even though the Higgs has a lower mass. Why did this happen?</p>
<p>It happened because muon neutrinos interact much more weakly with ordinary matter than do muons, and are therefore much harder to produce, measure and study than are muons. Something similar is true of the Higgs particle compared to the top quark; although the top quark is nearly 50% heavier than the Higgs, the Large Hadron Collider [LHC] produces 20 times as many top quarks and anti-quarks as Higgs particles, and the signature of a top quark is usually more distinctive. So new low-mass particles to which the Higgs particle can perhaps decay could easily have been missed, if they interact much more weakly with ordinary matter than do the Z particle, top quark, bottom quark, muon, etc.</p>
<p>The muon neutrino was discovered not because these neutrinos were directly produced in collisions of ordinary matter but rather because muons were first produced, and these then decayed to muon neutrinos (plus an electron and an electron anti-neutrino). &nbsp;Similarly, new particles may be discovered not because we produce them <strong>directly</strong>&nbsp;in ordinary matter collisions, but because, as in the above figure, we first produce a Higgs particle in proton-proton collisions at the LHC, and the Higgs may then in turn decay to them.</p>
<p>I should emphasize that <strong>direct</strong> searches for these types of new particles <em>are</em> taking place, using both old and new data from a variety of particle physics machines (<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/08/18/new-experimental-result-searching-for-hidden-particles/" target="_blank">here&#8217;s one example</a>.) But it is often the case that these direct searches are not powerful enough to find the new particles, at least not soon, and therefore they may first show up in unexpected exotic decays of the Higgs&#8230; especially since the LHC has already produced a million Higgs particles, most of them at the ATLAS and CMS experiments, with a smaller fraction at LHCb.</p>
<p>I hope that some ATLAS and CMS experimenters are looking for this signal&#8230; and that we&#8217;ll hear results at the upcoming Moriond conference.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">On Tuesday I told you I&#8217;d created </span><a style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;" title="Higgs Decays to Unknown Spin-Zero Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/non-standard-decays-of-the-observed-higgs-particle/higgs-decays-to-unknown-spin-zero-particles/" target="_blank">a page summarizing what we know</a><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;"> about </span><span style="color:#993366;"><em style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;">possible Higgs decays to <strong>two new spin-zero particles</strong>, which in turn decay to <strong>quark pairs or lepton pairs</strong> according to our general expectation that heavier particles are preferred in spin-zero-particle decays</em></span><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;"><span style="color:#993366;">.</span> A number of theories (including models with more Higgs particles, certain non-minimal supersymmetric models, some Little Higgs models, and various dark matter models) predict this possibility.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago, <a title="Our Survey of Exotic Decays of the Higgs is Done" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/12/19/our-survey-of-exotic-higgs-decays-is-done/" target="_blank">I reported on the completion of a large project</a>, with which I&#8217;ve been personally involved, to investigate how particle physicists at the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC] could be searching, <em><strong>not only in the future but even right now</strong></em>, for possible &#8220;Exotic Decays&#8221; of the <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">newly-discovered Higgs particle</a> .</p>
<p>By the term &#8220;exotic decays&#8221; (also called &#8220;non-Standard-Model [<span style="color:#993366;">non-SM</span>] Decays&#8221;), we mean &#8220;decays of this particle that are not expected to occur unless there&#8217;s something missing from the Standard Model <em>(the set of equations we use to describe </em><em><a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the known elementary particles and forces</a> and <a title="The Standard Model Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/" target="_blank">the simplest possible type of Higgs field and its particle</a>)</em>.&#8221;  I&#8217;ve written extensively on this website about this possibility <em>(see <a title="Exotic Decays of the Higgs: A High Priority for 2012" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/01/27/exotic-decays-of-the-higgs-a-high-priority-for-2012/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a title="Lightweight Higgs: A `Sensitive Creature’" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/lightweight-higgs-a-sensitive-creature/" target="_blank">here</a>,  <a title="A Quantitative Addendum to the Sensitive Creature" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/lightweight-higgs-a-sensitive-creature/a-quantitative-addendum-to-the-sensitive-creature/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a title="At the SEARCH Workshop on the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/18/at-the-search-workshop-on-the-lhc/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a title="Latest from the SEARCH Workshop" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/20/latest-from-the-search-workshop/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a title="Exotic Higgs Decays: Making the Case" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/05/30/exotic-higgs-decays-making-the-case/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a title="Data Parking at CMS" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/lhcposts/triggering-advances-in-2012/data-parking-at-cms/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a title="Final Day of SEARCH 2013" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/08/23/final-day-of-search-2013/" target="_blank">here</a>)</em>, though mostly in general terms. In our <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1312.4992" target="_blank">recent paper on Exotic Decays</a>, we have gone into nitty-gritty detail&#8230; the sort of detail only an expert could love.  This week I&#8217;m splitting the difference, providing a detailed and semi-technical overview of the results of our work.  This includes organized lists of some of the decays we&#8217;re most likely to run across, and suggestions regarding the ones most promising to look for (which aren&#8217;t always the most common ones.)</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">Before I begin, let me again mention the twelve young physicists who were co-authors on this work, all of whom are pre-tenure and several of whom are still not professors yet.  </span><em style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;">[ When <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn24798-higgs-boson-could-reveal-deviant-behaviour-in-2014.html" target="_blank">New Scientist reported on our work</a>, they unfortunately didn&#8217;t even mention, much less list, my co-authors.]</em> They are (in alphabetical order): <span style="color:#800000;">David Curtin, Rouven Essig, Stefania Gori, Prerit Jaiswal, Andrey Katz, Tao Liu, Zhen Liu, David McKeen, Jessie Shelton, Ze&#8217;ev Surujon, Brock Tweedie, and Yi-Ming Zhong.</span><span id="more-7247"></span></p>
<p><strong>The Project</strong></p>
<p>With an immense variety of possible exotic decays of the observed Higgs particle, a thorough search poses a severe challenge.  Experimenters at ATLAS and CMS, the two general-purpose experiments at the LHC, have their work cut out for them. But the payoff would also be huge; if any such decay turned up, it would mean a revolutionary discovery of new forces and (almost always) new particles, ones that lie outside the Standard Model, which has stood as the predictive framework for particle physics for nearly 40 years.</p>
<p>Writing a paper that completely covers all the possibilities would have been impossible. We had to choose a more limited goal, and so the decision was to restrict ourselves to</p>
<ul>
<li>decays which do not produce any unknown long-lived particles (except ones that are always completely invisible to the detector);</li>
<li>decays in which the number of observable <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">electrons, muons, taus, photons, quarks, or gluons (or their anti-particles)</a> is at most 4.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s important to realize, then, that <strong><em>we left out a lot</em></strong>. But at least, with these restrictions, we had a finite list of cases (about 20 sub-classes) to consider, and it took us under 200 pages to do so.</p>
<p>Perhaps our most important observations are that:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#ff0000;"><em><strong>Discoveries are still possible with the existing data set.</strong></em></span> CMS and ATLAS could add to our knowledge by looking more carefully at the data they already have, rather than waiting a year or two for more.</li>
<li>Some completed ATLAS and CMS searches for other phenomena, which weren&#8217;t intended for this purpose, nevertheless, according to our estimates, <strong><em>already put interesting and even sometimes stringent limits</em></strong> on non-SM Higgs decays. Of course, dedicated searches would certainly do even better.</li>
<li>There are many opportunities coming when the LHC turns on again in 2015. One of the big challenges is <em><strong>to assure that <a title="The Trigger: Discarding All But the Gold" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/the-trigger-discarding-all-but-the-gold/" target="_blank">the trigger system</a></strong></em>, which faces even greater strain as the LHC collision energy and collision rate increase, <em><strong>can avoid discarding certain types of non-SM Higgs decays</strong></em>. This important issue must be studied <em>this year</em>!</li>
</ul>
<p>Today, I&#8217;ve created <a title="Higgs Decays to Unknown Spin-Zero Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/non-standard-decays-of-the-observed-higgs-particle/higgs-decays-to-unknown-spin-zero-particles/" target="_blank">a page summarizing what we know</a> about <span style="color:#800080;"><em>possible Higgs decays to <strong>two new spin-zero particles</strong>, which in turn decay to quark pairs or lepton pairs according to our general expectation that heavier particles are preferred in spin-zero-particle decays</em></span>. A number of theories (including models with more Higgs particles, certain non-minimal supersymmetric models, some Little Higgs models, and various dark matter models) predict this possibility.</p>
<p>Over the coming week or so, I&#8217;ll be adding more pages with other classes of decays, and pointing you to them as they&#8217;re ready.</p>
