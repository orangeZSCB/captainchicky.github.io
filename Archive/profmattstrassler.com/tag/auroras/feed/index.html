										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Those of you who remember <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2017/07/16/ongoing-chance-of-northern-or-southern-lights/">my post on how to keep track of opportunities to see northern (and southern) lights</a> will be impressed by this image from <a href="http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/communities/space-weather-enthusiasts">http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/communities/space-weather-enthusiasts</a> .</p>
<p><img class="" src="http://services.swpc.noaa.gov/images/swx-overview-small.gif" alt="The latest space weather overview plot" width="425" height="432" /></p>
<p>The top plot shows the number of X-rays (high-energy photons [particles of light]) coming from the sun, and that huge spike in the middle of the plot indicates a very powerful solar flare occurred about 24 hours ago.  It should take about 2 days from the time of the flare for its other effects &#8212; the cloud of electrically-charged particles expelled from the Sun&#8217;s atmosphere &#8212; to arrive at Earth.  The electrically-charged particles are what generate the auroras, when they are directed by Earth&#8217;s magnetic field to enter the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere near the Earth&#8217;s magnetic poles, where they crash into atoms in the upper atmosphere, exciting them and causing them to radiate visible light.</p>
<p>The flare was very powerful, but its cloud of particles didn&#8217;t head straight for Earth.  We might get only a glancing blow.  So we don&#8217;t know how big an effect to expect here on our planet.  All we can do for now is be hopeful, and wait.</p>
<p>In any case, auroras borealis and australis are possible in the next day or so.  Watch for the middle plot to go haywire, and for the bars in the lower plot to jump higher; then you know the time has arrived.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As forecast, the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2017/07/15/lights-in-the-sky-maybe/">cloud of particles from Friday&#8217;s solar flare</a> (the &#8220;coronal mass emission&#8221;, or &#8220;CME&#8221;) arrived at our planet a few hours after my last post, early in the morning New York time. <em>If you&#8217;d like to know how I knew that it had reached Earth, and how I know what&#8217;s going on now, scroll down to the end of this post and I&#8217;ll show you the data I was following, which is publicly available at all times.</em></p>
<p>So far the resulting auroras have stayed fairly far north, and so I haven&#8217;t seen any &#8212; though they were apparently seen last night in Washington and Wyoming, and presumably easily seen in Canada and Alaska. <em>[Caution: sometimes when people say they&#8217;ve been &#8220;seen&#8221;, they don&#8217;t quite mean that; I often see lovely photos of aurora that were only visible to a medium-exposure camera shot, not to the naked eye.]</em>  Or rather, I should say that the auroras have stayed fairly close to the Earth&#8217;s poles; they were also seen in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Russia and Europe have a good opportunity this evening. As for the U.S.? The storm in the Earth&#8217;s magnetic field is still going on, so tonight is still a definite possibility for northern states. Keep an eye out! Look for what is usually a white or green-hued glow, often in swathes or in stripes pointing up from the northern horizon, or even overhead if you&#8217;re lucky.  The stripes can move around quite rapidly.</p>
<p>Now, here&#8217;s how I knew all this.  I&#8217;m no expert on auroras; that&#8217;s not my scientific field at all.   But the U.S. Space Weather Prediction Center at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which needs to monitor conditions in space in case they should threaten civilian and military satellites or even installations on the ground, provides <a href="http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/communities/space-weather-enthusiasts">a wonderful website with lots of relevant data.</a></p>
<p>The first image on the site provides the space weather overview; a screenshot from the present is shown below, with my annotations.  The upper graph indicates a blast of x-rays <em>(a form of light not visible to the human eye)</em> which is generated when the solar flare, the magnetically-driven explosion on the sun, first occurs.  Then the slower cloud of particles (protons, electrons, and other atomic nuclei, all of which have mass and therefore can&#8217;t travel at light&#8217;s speed) takes a couple of days to reach Earth.  It&#8217;s arrival is shown by the sudden jump in the middle graph.  Finally, the lower graph measures how active the Earth&#8217;s magnetic field is.  The only problem with that plot is it tends to be three hours out of date, so beware of that! A &#8220;Kp index&#8221; of 5 shows significant activity; 6 means that auroras are likely to be moving away from the poles, and 7 or 8 mean that the chances in a place like the north half of the United States are pretty good.  So far, 6 has been the maximum generated by the current flare, but things can fluctuate a little, so 6 or 7 might occur tonight.  Keep an eye on that lower plot; if it drops back down to 4, forget it, but it it&#8217;s up at 7, take a look for sure!</p>

<p>Also on the site is data from <a href="http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/ace-real-time-solar-wind">the ACE satellite</a>.  This satellite sits 950 thousand miles [1.5 million kilometers] from Earth, between Earth and the Sun, which is 93 million miles [150 million kilometers] away.  At that vantage point, it gives us (and our other satellites) a little early warning, of up to an hour, before the cloud of slow particles from a solar flare arrives.  That provides enough lead-time to turn off critical equipment that might otherwise be damaged.  And you can see, in the plot below, how at a certain time in the last twenty-four hours the readings from the satellite, which had been tepid before, suddenly started fluctuating wildly.  That was the signal that the flare had struck the satellite, and would arrive shortly at our location.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a wonderful feature of the information revolution that you can get all this scientific data yourself, and not wait around hoping for a reporter or blogger to process it for you.  None of this was available when I was a child, and I missed many a sky show.  A big thank you to NOAA, and to the U.S. taxpayers who make their work possible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why did so few people see auroras on Friday night, after all the media hype? You can see one of two reasons in the data. <a title="Auroras — Quantum Physics in the Sky — Tonight?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/09/12/auroras-quantum-physics-in-the-sky-tonight/" target="_blank">As I explained in my last post</a>, you can read what happened in the data shown in the Satellite Environment Plot from <a href="http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/" target="_blank">this website</a> <em>(warning &#8212; they&#8217;re going to make new version of the website soon, so you might have to modify this info a bit.)</em> Here&#8217;s what the plot looked like Sunday morning.</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_7758" style="width: 489px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/satenvsept14.gif"><img loading="lazy" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-7758" data-attachment-id="7758" data-permalink="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/09/15/why-did-so-few-people-see-auroras-on-friday-night/satenvsept14/" data-orig-file="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/satenvsept14.gif" data-orig-size="640,480" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="SatEnvSept14" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="&lt;p&gt;What the &#8220;Satellite Environment Plot&#8221; on swpc.noaa.gov looked like on Sunday.  Friday is at left; time shown is &#8220;Universal&#8221; time; New York time is 4 hours later. There were two storms, shown as the red bars in the Kp index plot; one occurred very early Friday morning and one later on Friday.  You can see the start of the second storm in the &#8220;GOES Hp&#8221; plot, where the magnetic field goes wild very suddenly.  The storm was subsiding by midnight universal time, so it was mostly over by midnight New York time.&lt;/p&gt;

Friday is at left.  Time shown is &#8220;Universal&#8221; time (UTC); New York time is 4 hours later at this time of year. There were two storms, shown as the red bars in the Kp index chart (fourth line); one occurred very early Friday morning and one later on Friday. You can see the start of the second storm in the &#8220;GOES Hp&#8221; chart (third line), where the magnetic field goes wild very suddenly. The storm was subsiding by midnight Universal time, so it was mostly over by midnight New York time.</p></div>
<p>What the figure shows is that after a first geomagnetic storm very early Friday, a strong geomagnetic storm started (as shown by the sharp jump in the GOES Hp chart) later on Friday, a little after noon New York time [&#8220;UTC&#8221; is currently New York + 4/5 hours], and that it was short &#8212; mostly over before midnight. Those of you out west never had a chance; it was all over before the sun set. Only people in far western Europe had good timing. Whatever the media was saying about later Friday night and Saturday night was somewhere between uninformed and out of date.  Your best bet was to be looking at this chart, which would have shown you that (despite predictions, which for auroras are always quite uncertain) there was nothing going on after Friday midnight New York time.</p>
<p>But the second reason is something that the figure doesn&#8217;t show. Even though this was a strong geomagnetic storm (the Kp index reached 7, the strongest in quite some time), the auroras didn&#8217;t migrate particularly far south. They were seen in the northern skies of Maine, Vermont and New Hampshire, but not (as far as I know) in Massachusetts. Certainly I didn&#8217;t see them. That just goes to show you <em>(AccuWeather, and other media, are you listening?)</em> that predicting the precise timing and extent of auroras is educated guesswork, and will remain so until current knowledge, methods and information are enhanced. One simply can&#8217;t know for sure how far south the auroras will extend, even if the impact on the geomagnetic field is strong.</p>
<p>For those who did see the auroras on Friday night, <a href="http://spaceweathergallery.com/indiv_upload.php?upload_id=101829&amp;PHPSESSID=gqkuvfv22at9icg8c240bjun15" target="_blank">it was quite a sight</a>. And for the rest of us who didn&#8217;t see them this time, there&#8217;s no reason for us to give up. Solar maximum is not over, and even though this is a rather weak sunspot cycle, the chances for more auroras over the next year or so are still pretty good.</p>
<p>Finally, a lesson for those who went out and stared at the sky for hours after the storm was long over &#8212; get your scientific information <a href="http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/" target="_blank">from the source</a>!  There&#8217;s no need, in the modern world, to rely on out-of-date media reports.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maybe. If we collectively, and you personally, are lucky, then maybe you might see auroras &#8212; quantum physics in the sky &#8212; tonight.</p>
<p>Before I tell you about the science, I&#8217;m going to tell you where to get accurate information, and where <strong>not</strong> to get it; and then I&#8217;m going to give you a rough idea of what auroras are. It will be rough because it&#8217;s complicated and it would take more time than I have today, and it also will be rough because auroras are still only partly understood.</p>
<p><strong>Bad Information</strong></p>
<p>First though &#8212; as usual, <strong>do NOT get your information from the mainstream media</strong>, or even the media that ought to be scientifically literate but isn&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve seen a ton of misinformation already about timing, location, and where to look. For instance, here&#8217;s a map from AccuWeather, telling you who is likely to be able to see the auroras.</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_7748" style="width: 358px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/accuwxaurora.jpg"><img loading="lazy" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-7748" data-attachment-id="7748" data-permalink="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/09/12/auroras-quantum-physics-in-the-sky-tonight/accuwxaurora/" data-orig-file="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/accuwxaurora.jpg" data-orig-size="650,366" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="AccuWxAurora" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="&lt;p&gt;Don&#8217;t believe this map by AccuWeather.

But auroras, not much.</p></div>
<p>See that line below which it says &#8220;not visible&#8221;? This implies that there&#8217;s a nice sharp geographical line between those who <em>can&#8217;t possibly</em> see it and those who <em>will definitely</em> see it if the sky is clear. Nothing could be further than the truth. No one knows where that line will lie tonight, and besides, it won&#8217;t be a nice smooth curve. There could be auroras visible in New Mexico, and none in Maine&#8230; not because it&#8217;s cloudy, but because the start time of the aurora can&#8217;t be predicted, and because its strength and location will change over time. If you&#8217;re north of that line, you may see nothing, and if you&#8217;re south of it you still might see something.  (Accuweather also says that you&#8217;ll see it first in the northeast and then in the midwest.  Not necessarily.  It may become visible across the U.S. all at the same time.  Or it may be seen out west but not in the east, or vice versa.)</p>
<p>Auroras aren&#8217;t like solar or lunar eclipses, absolutely predictable as to when they&#8217;ll happen and who can see them. They aren&#8217;t even like comets, which behave unpredictably but at least have predictable orbits. (Remember <a title="Icy Comet ISON’s Trial By Fire" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/11/28/icy-comet-isons-trial-by-fire/">Comet ISON</a>? It arrived exactly when expected, but evaporated and disintegrated under the Sun&#8217;s intense stare.) Auroras are more like weather &#8212; and predictions of auroras are more like predictions of rain, only in some ways worse. An aurora is a dynamic, ever-changing phenomenon, and to predict where and when it can be seen is not much more than educated guesswork. No prediction of an aurora sighting is <strong>EVER</strong> a guarantee. Nor is the absence of an aurora prediction a guarantee one can&#8217;t be seen; occasionally they appear unexpectedly.  That said, the best chance of seeing one further away from the poles than usual is a couple of days after a major solar flare &#8212; and we had one a couple of days ago.</p>
<p><strong>Good Information and How to Use it</strong></p>
<p>If you want accurate information about auroras, you want to get it from the <a href="http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/" target="_blank">Space Weather Prediction Center, click here for their main webpage.</a> Look at the colorful graph on the lower left of that webpage, the &#8220;Satellite Environment Plot&#8221;. Here&#8217;s an example of that plot taken from earlier today:</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_7749" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/satenvsept142014.gif"><img loading="lazy" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-7749" data-attachment-id="7749" data-permalink="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/09/12/auroras-quantum-physics-in-the-sky-tonight/satenvsept142014/" data-orig-file="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/satenvsept142014.gif" data-orig-size="640,480" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="SatEnvSept142014" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;Satellite Environment Plot&#8221; from earlier today; focus your attention on the two lower charts, the one with the red and blue wiggly lines (GOES Hp) and on the one with the bars (Kp Index).  How to use them is explained in the text.&lt;/p&gt;

How to use them is explained in the text.</p></div>
<p>There&#8217;s a LOT of data on that plot, but for lack of time let me cut to the chase. The most important information is on the bottom two charts.<span id="more-7747"></span></p>
<p>The bottom row, the &#8220;Estimated Kp index&#8221;, tells you, roughly, how much &#8220;geomagnetic activity&#8221; there is (i.e., how disturbed is the earth&#8217;s magnetic field). If the most recent bars are red, then the activity index is 5 or above, and there&#8217;s a decent chance of auroras. The higher the index, the more likely are auroras and the further away from the earth&#8217;s poles they will be seen. That is, if you live in the northern hemisphere, the larger is the Kp index, the further south the auroras are likely to be visible. [If it&#8217;s more than 5, you&#8217;ve got a good shot well down into the bulk of the United States.]</p>
<p>The only problem with the Kp index is that it is a 3-hour average, so it may not go red until the auroras have already been going for a couple of hours! So that&#8217;s why the row above it, &#8220;GOES Hp&#8221;, is important and helpful. This plot gives you much more up-to-date information about what the magnetic field of the earth is up to. Notice, in the plot above, that the magnetic field goes crazy (i.e. the lines get all wiggly) just around the time that the Kp index starts to be yellow or starts to be red.</p>
<p>Therefore, <em><strong>keep an eye on the GOES Hp chart</strong></em>. If you see it start to go crazy sometime in the next 48 hours, that&#8217;s a strong indication that the blast of electrically-charged particles from the Sun, thrown out in that recent solar flare, has arrived at the Earth, and auroras are potentially imminent.  It won&#8217;t tell you how strong they are though.  Still, this is your signal, if skies near you are dark and sufficiently clear, to go out and look for auroras. If you don&#8217;t see them, try again later; they&#8217;re changeable. If you don&#8217;t see them over the coming hour or so, keep an eye on the Kp index chart. If you&#8217;re in the mid-to-northern part of the U.S. and you see that index jump higher than 5, there&#8217;s a significant geomagnetic storm going on, so keep trying. And if you see it reach 8 or so, definitely try even if you&#8217;re living quite far south.</p>
<p>Of course, don&#8217;t forget Twitter and other real-time feeds.  These can tell you whether and where people are seeing auroras. Keeping an eye on Twitter and hashtags like #aurora, #auroras, #northernlights is probably a good idea.</p>
<p>One more thing before getting into the science. We call these things the &#8220;northern lights&#8221; in the northern hemisphere, but clearly, since they can be seen in different places, they&#8217;re not always or necessarily north of any particular place. Looking north is a good idea &#8212; most of us who can see these things tonight or tomorrow night will probably be south of them &#8212; but the <em><strong>auroras can be overhead or even south of you</strong></em>. So don&#8217;t immediately give up if your northern sky is blocked by clouds or trees. Look around the sky.</p>
<p><strong>Auroras: Quantum Physics in the Sky</strong></p>
<p>Now, what are you seeing if you are lucky enough to see an aurora? Most likely what you&#8217;ll see is green, though red, blue and purple are common (and sometimes combinations which give other colors, but these are the basic ones.)  Why?</p>
<p>The typical sequence of events preceding a bright aurora is this:</p>
<ol>
<li>A sunspot &#8212; an area of intense magnetic activity on the Sun, where the sun&#8217;s apparent surface looks dark &#8212; becomes unstable and suffers an explosion of sorts, a solar flare.</li>
<li>Associated with the solar flare may be a &#8220;coronal mass ejection&#8221; &#8212; the expulsion of huge numbers of charged (and neutral) particles out into space. These charged particles include both <a title="Electrons: On the Outskirts of Atoms" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/electrons-on-the-outskirts-of-atoms/" target="_blank">electrons</a> and <a title="Atoms: Their Inner Workings" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/atoms-building-blocks-of-molecules/atoms-their-inner-workings/" target="_blank">ions</a> (i.e. atoms which have lost one or more electrons). <em>(Coronal mass ejections, which are not well understood, can occur in other ways, but the strongest are from big flares.)</em></li>
<li>These charged particles travel at high speeds (much faster than any current human spaceship, but much slower than the speed of light) across space. If the sunspot that flared happens to be facing Earth, then some of those particles will arrive at Earth after as little as a day and as much as three days. Powerful flares typically make faster particles which therefore arrive sooner.</li>
<li>When these charged particles arrive near Earth, it may happen (depending on what the Sun&#8217;s magnetic field and the Earth&#8217;s magnetic field and the magnetic fields near the particles are all doing) that many of the particles may spiral down the Earth&#8217;s magnetic field, which draws them to the Earth&#8217;s north and south magnetic poles (which lie close to the Earth&#8217;s north and south geographic poles.)</li>
<li>When these high-energy particles (electrons and ions) rain down onto the Earth, they typically will hit atoms in the Earth&#8217;s upper atmosphere, 40 to 200 miles up. The ensuing collisions kick <a title="Atoms: Their Inner Workings" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/atoms-building-blocks-of-molecules/atoms-their-inner-workings/" target="_blank">electrons in the struck atoms into &#8220;orbits&#8221; that they don&#8217;t normally occupy</a>, as though they were suddenly moved from an inner superhighway ring road around a city to an outer ring road highway. We call these outer orbits &#8220;excited orbits&#8221;, and an atom of this type an &#8220;excited atom&#8221;.</li>
<li>Eventually the electrons fall from these &#8220;excited orbits&#8221; back down to their usual orbits. This is often referred to as a &#8220;quantum transition&#8221; or, colloquially, a &#8220;quantum jump&#8221;, as the electron is never really found between the starting outer orbit and the final inner one; it almost instantaneously transfers from one to the other.</li>
<li>In doing so, the jumping electron will emit a particle of <em>electromagnetic radiation</em>, called a &#8220;<em>photon</em>&#8221;. The energy of that photon, thanks to the wonderful properties of quantum mechanics, <em><strong>is always the same</strong></em> for any particular quantum transition.</li>
<li>Visible light is a form of electromagnetic radiation, and photons of visible light are, by definition, ones that our eyes can see. The reason we can see auroras is that for particular quantum transitions of oxygen and nitrogen, the photons emitted are indeed those of visible light. Moreover, <strong><em>because the energy for each photon from a given transition is always the same, the color of the light that our eyes see, for that particular transition, is always the same</em></strong>. There is a transition in oxygen that always gives green light; that&#8217;s why auroras are often green. There is a more fragile transition that always gives red light; powerful auroras, which can excite oxygen atoms even higher in the atmosphere, where they are more diffuse and less likely to hit something before they emit light, can give red auroras. Similarly, nitrogen molecules have a transition that can give blue light. <em>(Other transitions give light that our eyes can&#8217;t see.)</em>  Combinations of these can give yellows, pinks, purples, whites, etc. But the basic colors are typically green and red, occasionally blue, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>So if you are lucky enough to see an aurora tonight or tomorrow night, consider what you are seeing.  Huge energies involving magnetic fields on the Sun have blown particles &#8212; the same particles that are of particular significance to this website &#8212; into space.  Particle physics and atomic physics at the top of the atmosphere lead to the emission of light many miles above the Earth.  And the remarkable surprises of quantum mechanics make that light not a bland grey, with all possible colors blended crudely together, but instead a magical display of specific and gorgeous hues, reminding us that the world is far more subtle than our daily lives would lead us to believe.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>[UPDATE, midnight New York time: the cloud of particles from the solar flare arrived a few hours ago, but it didn&#8217;t impact the earth&#8217;s magnetic field quite as hard as the best-guess forecast.  (Remember the probability of a geomagnetic storm was only 60%; i.e. the probability of no storm was 40%.) Right now, the auroras are likely visible in Canada but probably not in the US.  This could change, but don&#8217;t get your hopes up too high; we may have to wait for the next solar flare.]</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been sidelined with computer troubles and non-science activities, so first, a belated thanks to everyone who left a thoughtful comment after <a title="Science and the Common Good: A College&nbsp;Visit" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/04/09/science-and-the-common-good-a-college-visit/" target="_blank">Monday&#8217;s post and question about communicating science to the public</a>. &nbsp;I appreciate hearing your views, especially from readers with a diversity of backgrounds!</p>
<p>Now, many of you may have heard that there is a forecast of northern (and southern) lights, also known as auroras, tonight. &nbsp;What you&#8217;ve heard is correct: today&#8217;s NOAA space-weather forecast, from &nbsp;<a href="http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/forecast.html">http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/forecast.html</a>,&nbsp; says</p>
<pre>VI.  Geomagnetic Activity Probabilities 13 Apr-15 Apr
A.  Middle Latitudes
Active                30/30/15
Minor Storm           35/45/05
Major-severe storm    10/15/01
B.  High Latitudes
Active                10/15/15
Minor Storm           20/25/20
Major-severe storm    60/35/20</pre>
<p>i.e. it shows that even in mid-latitudes (meaning northern US and southern Canada, and northern Europe, along perhaps with parts of Australia and New Zealand [?]) they are estimating a 35%-45% probability of a minor `geomagnetic storm&#8217; tonight, with a 10-15% probability of a major storm&#8230; and a geomagnetic storm, which literally means a lot of activity in the earth&#8217;s magnetic field, generally leads to auroras further away from the north and south pole than usual.<span id="more-5791"></span></p>
<p>Auroras are caused when swarms of electrically charged particles (<a title="Electrons: On the Outskirts of&nbsp;Atoms" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/electrons-on-the-outskirts-of-atoms/" target="_blank">electrons</a> and <a title="Atoms: Building Blocks of&nbsp;Molecules" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/atoms-building-blocks-of-molecules/" target="_blank">ions</a>) from the sun arrive in the earth&#8217;s vicinity, are captured by the earth&#8217;s magnetic field, spiral down toward the north and south pole of the earth, and hit <a title="The Molecular Structure of&nbsp;Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-molecular-structure-of-matter/" target="_blank">molecules</a> in the earth&#8217;s atmosphere, causing them to glow. <em>&nbsp;[<a href="http://pwg.gsfc.nasa.gov/polar/telecons/archive/PR_E-PO/Aurora_flyer/aurora-flyer_p2.doc.pdf" target="_blank">Here&#8217;s a NASA flyer with a drawing and a little more information.</a>]</em> A strong solar flare (a giant explosion on the surface of the sun) can generate a huge cloud of charged particles (a CME, or coronal mass ejection), and if this cloud arrives at the earth it can not only generate auroras but also&nbsp;move the earth&#8217;s magnetic field around, with the effect that some of this glow is found well away from its usual location near the poles, over places where more humans live.</p>
<p>And because there was a big CME on Thursday that seemed to be aimed at the earth, and because it takes about two days for such a cloud to travel out to where the earth is, <del datetime="2013-04-13T22:47:47+00:00">the space weather forecasters are expecting the CME&#8217;s particles to hit the earth any time now</del> It has apparently arrived! When that happens, <strong>if</strong> enough of those particles get caught in the earth&#8217;s magnetic field, we&#8217;ll start seeing auroras away from the earth&#8217;s poles.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">Auroras are generally quite dim, though easy to see in a naturally dark sky &#8212; so you need to be looking after dark and (unless the auroras are exceptionally bright) ideally some distance from any city lights, with eyes adjusted to the darkness, and with few clouds and no haze. &nbsp;The lights are most likely to be &nbsp;found to the north of your location, but the further north you are, the more likely they are to be overhead. &nbsp;(Switch north and south if you&#8217;re in the Southern Hemisphere.)</span></p>
<p>Now, something else you may have seen is this map, due to <a href="http://www.accuweather.com/en/features/trend/dazzling_northern_lights_antic_1/10107004" target="_blank">accuweather.com</a>. &nbsp;The map shows where there likely will be cloud cover (red and yellow) and clear skies (green), but <strong><em>in one respect it is badly misleading</em></strong>: it has a line on it that separates the region where the auroras might be visible from the region where they are &#8220;NOT VISIBLE&#8221;. &nbsp;Well, do not entirely lose heart if you are a bit south of that line, and also, don&#8217;t be very sure of things if you are north of it. &nbsp;<strong>No one can predict very precisely where that line will be, and it will move around (quite likely northward) as time wears on following the CME&#8217;s arrival</strong>.</p>

<p>By the way, let&#8217;s ignore the breathless headline of the accompanying AccuWeather article: &#8220;<a href="http://www.accuweather.com/en/features/trend/dazzling_northern_lights_antic_1/10107004" target="_blank">Dazzling Northern Lights Anticipated Tonight</a>&#8221; &#8212; that&#8217;s journalistic license at work. &nbsp;(Not to mention the article&#8217;s scientific misstatement about protons.) The auroras generated by the solar flare may be anything from a dim, quietly beautiful green wash to a bright red and/or multi-color light show, and no one, certainly not AccuWeather, can tell you which it will be, especially not in a specific time or location. &nbsp;So be prepared for something that&#8217;s beautiful and subtle, not dazzling. &nbsp;If in fact you find yourself dazzled, count yourself very lucky!</p>
<p>Finally: one good way to know whether you should go outside to look at the auroras is to keep an eye on <a href="http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/today.html#satenv" target="_blank">this graph</a>. The bottom of the four plots on the graph is marked &#8220;Estimated Kp&#8221;, and you can see that it&#8217;s showing green bars most of the time. <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>But if the most recent bar is red, that means the earth&#8217;s magnetic field is significantly disturbed, and there&#8217;s a good chance of auroras further south than usual</strong></span>, in which case you should definitely consider going outside and taking a look. The higher the red bar, the more southerly the auroras are likely to go. &nbsp;<em>(If someone can remind me where one can find more timely updates of the Kp estimate, I&#8217;d appreciate that.)</em></p>
<p><del>Meanwhile, the later the CME arrives (and it is already a bit late) the less likely it is that the CME hits the earth head on, and the less likely it becomes that we&#8217;ll see auroras far from the poles tonight.</del>  UPDATE: The CME has arrived, a little while before sunset in New York.  If in fact we do get auroras at all, it&#8217;s quite possible you&#8217;ll be able to see them an hour or two after sunset in the northern United States and Canada.</p>
<p>Wishing you good luck with one of the first aurora opportunities of 2013!  And if you see one, think to yourself: <em>physics is beautiful!</em></p>
