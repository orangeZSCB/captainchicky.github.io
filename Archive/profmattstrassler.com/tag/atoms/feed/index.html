										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maybe. If we collectively, and you personally, are lucky, then maybe you might see auroras &#8212; quantum physics in the sky &#8212; tonight.</p>
<p>Before I tell you about the science, I&#8217;m going to tell you where to get accurate information, and where <strong>not</strong> to get it; and then I&#8217;m going to give you a rough idea of what auroras are. It will be rough because it&#8217;s complicated and it would take more time than I have today, and it also will be rough because auroras are still only partly understood.</p>
<p><strong>Bad Information</strong></p>
<p>First though &#8212; as usual, <strong>do NOT get your information from the mainstream media</strong>, or even the media that ought to be scientifically literate but isn&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve seen a ton of misinformation already about timing, location, and where to look. For instance, here&#8217;s a map from AccuWeather, telling you who is likely to be able to see the auroras.</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_7748" style="width: 358px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/accuwxaurora.jpg"><img loading="lazy" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-7748" data-attachment-id="7748" data-permalink="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/09/12/auroras-quantum-physics-in-the-sky-tonight/accuwxaurora/" data-orig-file="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/accuwxaurora.jpg" data-orig-size="650,366" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="AccuWxAurora" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="&lt;p&gt;Don&#8217;t believe this map by AccuWeather.  Oh, sure, they know something about clouds.  But auroras, not much.  &lt;/p&gt;
" data-medium-file="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/accuwxaurora.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/accuwxaurora.jpg?w=500" class=" wp-image-7748" src="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/accuwxaurora.jpg?w=348&#038;h=204" alt="Don't believe this map by AccuWeather.  Oh, sure, they know something about clouds.  But auroras, not much.  " width="348" height="204" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-7748" class="wp-caption-text">Don&#8217;t believe this map by AccuWeather. Oh, sure, they know something about clouds. But auroras, not much.</p></div>
<p>See that line below which it says &#8220;not visible&#8221;? This implies that there&#8217;s a nice sharp geographical line between those who <em>can&#8217;t possibly</em> see it and those who <em>will definitely</em> see it if the sky is clear. Nothing could be further than the truth. No one knows where that line will lie tonight, and besides, it won&#8217;t be a nice smooth curve. There could be auroras visible in New Mexico, and none in Maine&#8230; not because it&#8217;s cloudy, but because the start time of the aurora can&#8217;t be predicted, and because its strength and location will change over time. If you&#8217;re north of that line, you may see nothing, and if you&#8217;re south of it you still might see something.  (Accuweather also says that you&#8217;ll see it first in the northeast and then in the midwest.  Not necessarily.  It may become visible across the U.S. all at the same time.  Or it may be seen out west but not in the east, or vice versa.)</p>
<p>Auroras aren&#8217;t like solar or lunar eclipses, absolutely predictable as to when they&#8217;ll happen and who can see them. They aren&#8217;t even like comets, which behave unpredictably but at least have predictable orbits. (Remember <a title="Icy Comet ISON’s Trial By Fire" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/11/28/icy-comet-isons-trial-by-fire/">Comet ISON</a>? It arrived exactly when expected, but evaporated and disintegrated under the Sun&#8217;s intense stare.) Auroras are more like weather &#8212; and predictions of auroras are more like predictions of rain, only in some ways worse. An aurora is a dynamic, ever-changing phenomenon, and to predict where and when it can be seen is not much more than educated guesswork. No prediction of an aurora sighting is <strong>EVER</strong> a guarantee. Nor is the absence of an aurora prediction a guarantee one can&#8217;t be seen; occasionally they appear unexpectedly.  That said, the best chance of seeing one further away from the poles than usual is a couple of days after a major solar flare &#8212; and we had one a couple of days ago.</p>
<p><strong>Good Information and How to Use it</strong></p>
<p>If you want accurate information about auroras, you want to get it from the <a href="http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/" target="_blank">Space Weather Prediction Center, click here for their main webpage.</a> Look at the colorful graph on the lower left of that webpage, the &#8220;Satellite Environment Plot&#8221;. Here&#8217;s an example of that plot taken from earlier today:</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_7749" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/satenvsept142014.gif"><img loading="lazy" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-7749" data-attachment-id="7749" data-permalink="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/09/12/auroras-quantum-physics-in-the-sky-tonight/satenvsept142014/" data-orig-file="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/satenvsept142014.gif" data-orig-size="640,480" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="SatEnvSept142014" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;Satellite Environment Plot&#8221; from earlier today; focus your attention on the two lower charts, the one with the red and blue wiggly lines (GOES Hp) and on the one with the bars (Kp Index).  How to use them is explained in the text.&lt;/p&gt;

How to use them is explained in the text.</p></div>
<p>There&#8217;s a LOT of data on that plot, but for lack of time let me cut to the chase. The most important information is on the bottom two charts.<span id="more-7747"></span></p>
<p>The bottom row, the &#8220;Estimated Kp index&#8221;, tells you, roughly, how much &#8220;geomagnetic activity&#8221; there is (i.e., how disturbed is the earth&#8217;s magnetic field). If the most recent bars are red, then the activity index is 5 or above, and there&#8217;s a decent chance of auroras. The higher the index, the more likely are auroras and the further away from the earth&#8217;s poles they will be seen. That is, if you live in the northern hemisphere, the larger is the Kp index, the further south the auroras are likely to be visible. [If it&#8217;s more than 5, you&#8217;ve got a good shot well down into the bulk of the United States.]</p>
<p>The only problem with the Kp index is that it is a 3-hour average, so it may not go red until the auroras have already been going for a couple of hours! So that&#8217;s why the row above it, &#8220;GOES Hp&#8221;, is important and helpful. This plot gives you much more up-to-date information about what the magnetic field of the earth is up to. Notice, in the plot above, that the magnetic field goes crazy (i.e. the lines get all wiggly) just around the time that the Kp index starts to be yellow or starts to be red.</p>
<p>Therefore, <em><strong>keep an eye on the GOES Hp chart</strong></em>. If you see it start to go crazy sometime in the next 48 hours, that&#8217;s a strong indication that the blast of electrically-charged particles from the Sun, thrown out in that recent solar flare, has arrived at the Earth, and auroras are potentially imminent.  It won&#8217;t tell you how strong they are though.  Still, this is your signal, if skies near you are dark and sufficiently clear, to go out and look for auroras. If you don&#8217;t see them, try again later; they&#8217;re changeable. If you don&#8217;t see them over the coming hour or so, keep an eye on the Kp index chart. If you&#8217;re in the mid-to-northern part of the U.S. and you see that index jump higher than 5, there&#8217;s a significant geomagnetic storm going on, so keep trying. And if you see it reach 8 or so, definitely try even if you&#8217;re living quite far south.</p>
<p>Of course, don&#8217;t forget Twitter and other real-time feeds.  These can tell you whether and where people are seeing auroras. Keeping an eye on Twitter and hashtags like #aurora, #auroras, #northernlights is probably a good idea.</p>
<p>One more thing before getting into the science. We call these things the &#8220;northern lights&#8221; in the northern hemisphere, but clearly, since they can be seen in different places, they&#8217;re not always or necessarily north of any particular place. Looking north is a good idea &#8212; most of us who can see these things tonight or tomorrow night will probably be south of them &#8212; but the <em><strong>auroras can be overhead or even south of you</strong></em>. So don&#8217;t immediately give up if your northern sky is blocked by clouds or trees. Look around the sky.</p>
<p><strong>Auroras: Quantum Physics in the Sky</strong></p>
<p>Now, what are you seeing if you are lucky enough to see an aurora? Most likely what you&#8217;ll see is green, though red, blue and purple are common (and sometimes combinations which give other colors, but these are the basic ones.)  Why?</p>
<p>The typical sequence of events preceding a bright aurora is this:</p>
<ol>
<li>A sunspot &#8212; an area of intense magnetic activity on the Sun, where the sun&#8217;s apparent surface looks dark &#8212; becomes unstable and suffers an explosion of sorts, a solar flare.</li>
<li>Associated with the solar flare may be a &#8220;coronal mass ejection&#8221; &#8212; the expulsion of huge numbers of charged (and neutral) particles out into space. These charged particles include both <a title="Electrons: On the Outskirts of Atoms" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/electrons-on-the-outskirts-of-atoms/" target="_blank">electrons</a> and <a title="Atoms: Their Inner Workings" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/atoms-building-blocks-of-molecules/atoms-their-inner-workings/" target="_blank">ions</a> (i.e. atoms which have lost one or more electrons). <em>(Coronal mass ejections, which are not well understood, can occur in other ways, but the strongest are from big flares.)</em></li>
<li>These charged particles travel at high speeds (much faster than any current human spaceship, but much slower than the speed of light) across space. If the sunspot that flared happens to be facing Earth, then some of those particles will arrive at Earth after as little as a day and as much as three days. Powerful flares typically make faster particles which therefore arrive sooner.</li>
<li>When these charged particles arrive near Earth, it may happen (depending on what the Sun&#8217;s magnetic field and the Earth&#8217;s magnetic field and the magnetic fields near the particles are all doing) that many of the particles may spiral down the Earth&#8217;s magnetic field, which draws them to the Earth&#8217;s north and south magnetic poles (which lie close to the Earth&#8217;s north and south geographic poles.)</li>
<li>When these high-energy particles (electrons and ions) rain down onto the Earth, they typically will hit atoms in the Earth&#8217;s upper atmosphere, 40 to 200 miles up. The ensuing collisions kick <a title="Atoms: Their Inner Workings" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/atoms-building-blocks-of-molecules/atoms-their-inner-workings/" target="_blank">electrons in the struck atoms into &#8220;orbits&#8221; that they don&#8217;t normally occupy</a>, as though they were suddenly moved from an inner superhighway ring road around a city to an outer ring road highway. We call these outer orbits &#8220;excited orbits&#8221;, and an atom of this type an &#8220;excited atom&#8221;.</li>
<li>Eventually the electrons fall from these &#8220;excited orbits&#8221; back down to their usual orbits. This is often referred to as a &#8220;quantum transition&#8221; or, colloquially, a &#8220;quantum jump&#8221;, as the electron is never really found between the starting outer orbit and the final inner one; it almost instantaneously transfers from one to the other.</li>
<li>In doing so, the jumping electron will emit a particle of <em>electromagnetic radiation</em>, called a &#8220;<em>photon</em>&#8221;. The energy of that photon, thanks to the wonderful properties of quantum mechanics, <em><strong>is always the same</strong></em> for any particular quantum transition.</li>
<li>Visible light is a form of electromagnetic radiation, and photons of visible light are, by definition, ones that our eyes can see. The reason we can see auroras is that for particular quantum transitions of oxygen and nitrogen, the photons emitted are indeed those of visible light. Moreover, <strong><em>because the energy for each photon from a given transition is always the same, the color of the light that our eyes see, for that particular transition, is always the same</em></strong>. There is a transition in oxygen that always gives green light; that&#8217;s why auroras are often green. There is a more fragile transition that always gives red light; powerful auroras, which can excite oxygen atoms even higher in the atmosphere, where they are more diffuse and less likely to hit something before they emit light, can give red auroras. Similarly, nitrogen molecules have a transition that can give blue light. <em>(Other transitions give light that our eyes can&#8217;t see.)</em>  Combinations of these can give yellows, pinks, purples, whites, etc. But the basic colors are typically green and red, occasionally blue, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>So if you are lucky enough to see an aurora tonight or tomorrow night, consider what you are seeing.  Huge energies involving magnetic fields on the Sun have blown particles &#8212; the same particles that are of particular significance to this website &#8212; into space.  Particle physics and atomic physics at the top of the atmosphere lead to the emission of light many miles above the Earth.  And the remarkable surprises of quantum mechanics make that light not a bland grey, with all possible colors blended crudely together, but instead a magical display of specific and gorgeous hues, reminding us that the world is far more subtle than our daily lives would lead us to believe.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two new ground-breaking measurements reported results in the last 24 hours!  Here are very quick summaries.</p>
<p>A group of atomic physicists, called <a href="http://www.electronedm.org/" target="_blank">the ACME collaboration</a>, has performed <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.7534v1.pdf" target="_blank">the best search so far for the electric dipole moment (EDM) of the electron</a>.  Unfortunately they didn&#8217;t find the EDM, but the limit</p>
<ul>
<li>|d<sub>e</sub>| &lt; 8.7  10<sup>-29</sup> <em>e</em> cm</li>
</ul>
<p>is <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>12 times stronger</strong></span> than the previous one.  While this is still a billion times larger than what is expected in the Standard Model of particle physics (the equations used for <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the known elementary particles and forces</a>), there are various types of as-yet <em>unknown</em> particles and forces that could easily produce a much larger electron EDM, through new violations of <a title="C, P, T (And Their Combinations)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/c-p-t-and-their-combinations/" target="_blank">T symmetry</a> (or, almost equivalently, CP symmetry).  These effects could have been large enough to have been discovered by this experiment, so those types of possible phenomena are now more constrained than before.  Fortunately, there&#8217;s more to look forward to; the method these folks are using can eventually be improved by another factor of 10 or so, meaning that a discovery using this technique is still possible.</p>
<p>This morning the LUX dark matter experiment reported <a href="http://luxdarkmatter.org/papers/LUX_First_Results_2013.pdf" target="_blank">new results</a>, and knocked everyone&#8217;s socks off.  They have understood their backgrounds from radioactivity much better and more quickly than most of us expected, using new calibration methods and a much better characterization of their backgrounds than has previously been possible.  Although they have a detector only a bit larger than XENON100 and have only run the detector underground for three months, compared to the year or so that XENON100 ran previously, their limits on the rate for a dark matter particle to hit a Xenon nucleus beats XENON100&#8217;s results by a factor of 2 for a dark matter particle of mass 1000 GeV/c², increasing to about a factor of 3 for a dark matter particle in the 100 GeV/c² mass range, and soaring to a factor of 20 for a dark matter particle in the 10 GeV/c² mass range.  Consequently,<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;"> LUX pretty definitively rules out the possibility</span></strong>, hinted at by several dark matter experiments (as discussed in the second half of <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/dark-matter/current-hints-of-dark-matter-413/" target="_blank">the article I wrote about this in April</a>), <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">of a dark matter particle in the 5 &#8211; 20 GeV/c² mass range</span></strong>.  (See the figure below.) While XENON100 seemed to contradict this possibility already, it didn&#8217;t do so by a huge factor, so there were questions raised as to whether their result was convincing. But the sort of ~10 GeV/c² dark matter that people were talking about is ruled out by LUX by such a large factor that finding ways around their result seems nigh impossible.   And again, there&#8217;s more to look forward to; by 2015 their results should improve by another factor of 5 or so&#8230; so they get another shot at a discovery, as will XENON1T, the successor to XENON100.</p>
<p>Congratulations to both groups for their spectacular achievements!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Personal and professional activities require me to take a short break from posting.  But I hope, whether you&#8217;re a novice with no knowledge of physics, or you&#8217;re a current, former, or soon-to-be scientist or engineer, or you&#8217;re somewhere between, that you can find plenty of articles of interest to you on this site.  A couple of reminders and pointers:</p>
<p>* If you haven&#8217;t yet seen my one-hour talk for a general audience, &#8220;The Quest for the Higgs Boson&#8221;, intended to explain <em>accurately</em> what the <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">Higgs field and particle</a> are all about, while avoiding the most common misleading short-cuts, <a title="Movie Clips" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/videoclips/" target="_blank">it&#8217;s available now</a>, along with a 20-minute question and answer session.</p>
<p>* If you want a slightly more technical and written discussion of the Higgs field and particle, complete with animated images, and suitable for people who may once have had a semester or two of university physics and math, try <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/fields-and-their-particles-with-math/" target="_blank">this series</a> of articles first, and then go to <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/how-the-higgs-field-works-with-math/" target="_blank">this series</a>.</p>
<p>* If you&#8217;d like to better understand the language of &#8220;matter&#8221;, &#8220;mass&#8221;, and &#8220;energy&#8221; that is everywhere in popular explanations of science, but eternally confusing because of how different authors choose to talk about these subjects, you might find some useful tips in these articles: <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/more-on-mass/" target="_blank">#1</a>, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/mass-and-energy/" target="_blank">#2</a>, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/matter-and-energy-a-false-dichotomy/" target="_blank">#3</a>, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/the-energy-that-holds-things-together/" target="_blank">#4</a>.</p>
<p>* If you need a reminder about what &#8220;ordinary matter&#8221; (i.e. things like pickles, people and planets) is made of, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/" target="_blank">try this series</a>, which goes all the way from molecules down to quarks.</p>
<p>* If you&#8217;re curious about what &#8220;particle/<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/what-are-anti-particles/" target="_blank">anti-particle</a> annihilation&#8221; does and doesn&#8217;t mean, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/particleanti-particle-annihilation/" target="_blank">try this article</a>.</p>
<p>* And here are <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the types of particles and forces of nature that we know about</a>, and (for the moderately advanced reader) here&#8217;s <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/the-known-particles-if-the-higgs-field-were-zero/" target="_blank">how they&#8217;d be rearranged if the Higgs field were turned off</a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully there&#8217;s something on that list that interests you, and many links within those articles to other things that may even interest you more.  Have fun exploring!  And stay tuned; I&#8217;ll be writing more in the near future&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Particle physicists, cataloging the fundamental forces of nature, have named two of them the <strong>strong</strong> nuclear force and the <strong>weak</strong> nuclear force. <em>[A <strong>force</strong> is simply any phenomenon that pushes or pulls on objects.]</em> More generally they talk about <strong><em>strong</em></strong> and <strong><em>weak</em></strong> forces, speaking of electromagnetism as <em>rather weak</em> and gravity as <em>extremely weak</em>.  What do the words &#8220;strong&#8221; and &#8220;weak&#8221; mean here?  Don&#8217;t electric forces become strong at short distances? Isn&#8217;t gravity a pretty strong force, given that it makes it hard to lift a bar of gold?</p>
<p>Well, these words don&#8217;t mean what you think.  Yes, the electric force between two electrons becomes <em>stronger</em> (in <strong><em>absolute</em></strong> terms) as you bring them closer together; the force grows as one over the square of the distance between them.  Yet physicists, when speaking their own language to each other, will view this behavior as what is expected of a typical force, and so will say that &#8220;electromagnetism&#8217;s strength is <em>unchanging</em> with distance &#8212; and it is rather <em>weak</em> at all distances.</p>
<p>And the strength of gravity between the Earth and a bar of gold isn&#8217;t relevant either; physicists are interested in the strength of forces between individual elementary (or at least small) particles, not between large objects containing enormous numbers of particles.</p>
<p>Clearly there is a language difference here&#8230; as is often the case with words in English and words in Physics-ese.  It requires translation.  So I have now written <a title="The Strengths of the Known Forces" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-forces-of-nature/the-strength-of-the-known-forces/">an article explaining the language of &#8220;strong&#8221; and &#8220;weak&#8221; forces used by particle physicists</a>, describing how it works, why it is useful, and what it teaches us about the known forces: gravity, electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force, and the <em>(still unobserved but surely present)</em> Higgs force.<span id="more-6091"></span>  Physicists needed a deep understanding of quantum mechanics, special relativity, and their marriage in quantum field theory, developed over many decades, to understand that this way of talking about the strengths of forces is the best one to use.  It&#8217;s not the most natural one in daily life, but daily life reveals nothing of quantum field theory, so it isn&#8217;t surprising (or unusual) that what makes sense to us in our ordinary experience gives us a manner of speaking that isn&#8217;t useful in the world of particles and fields, and <em>vice versa</em>.</p>
<p>I hope this article will give you some interesting insights into how our world works, and clarify some things that may have been mysterious: why the weak nuclear force is weak; where the idea of &#8220;Grand Unification&#8221; initially comes from; why the proton&#8217;s size is what it is and why it is so much more complicated than an atom; why we observe gravity even though it is so much weaker than the other forces; and why the Higgs <em>force</em> hasn&#8217;t yet been observed, even though the Higgs force bears some passing (<a title="Why the Higgs and Gravity are Unrelated" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/10/15/why-the-higgs-and-gravity-are-unrelated/" target="_blank">though misleading</a>) resemblance to gravity, and even though we already know that there&#8217;s at least one Higgs field and one Higgs particle.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Structure of Matter series continues: <a title="The Nuclei of Atoms: At the Heart of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-nuclei-of-atoms-at-the-heart-of-matter/">last week&#8217;s article</a> on the basics of atomic nuclei is now supplemented with <a title="What Holds Nuclei Together?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-nuclei-of-atoms-at-the-heart-of-matter/what-holds-nuclei-together/">an article discussing the &#8220;residual&#8221; strong nuclear force</a> which binds protons and neutrons inside of nuclei.  It further explains why nuclei are so small compared to atoms.  Or rather, it explains it in part, because I have to also explain why protons and neutrons themselves are so small &#8212; which I will do soon enough.</p>
<p>As always, readers are encouraged to comment on things that don&#8217;t seem clear or correct.  And any nuclear physics experts who want to weigh in on my presentation &#8212; suggesting how it might be improved or extended, or identifying misconceptions on my part &#8212; are encouraged to speak up (publicly or privately as you prefer).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we&#8217;re entering the March conference season, when many new results from the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC] (based on analysis of last year&#8217;s data) and from other important experiments will start appearing.  Since the LHC&#8217;s proton-proton collisions went til December in 2012 (in 2011 they stopped in October) the time for LHC data analysis has been rather short.  I therefore think it likely that any really surprising results from the LHC will be delayed for extra scrutiny &#8212; and may not appear until late spring or summer, when there are other conferences.  But I could be wrong!  And <a title="Another Higgs Update from CERN" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/12/13/another-higgs-update-from-cern/">one thing we&#8217;re all waiting for</a> is the measurement by CMS (one of the two general purpose LHC experiments) of the rate for the recently discovered Higgs particle to decay to two photons.   However, we won&#8217;t see that result until CMS is absolutely confident in it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Posts have been notably absent, due mainly to travel with very limited internet; apologies for the related lack of replies to comments, which I hope to correct later this week.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I&#8217;ve been working on a couple of articles related to the nuclei of atoms, part of my <a title="The Structure of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/" target="_blank">Structure of Matter series,</a> which serves to introduce non-experts to <a title="Particle Physics Basics" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/" target="_blank">the basics of particle physics.</a>  The <a title="The Nuclei of Atoms: At the Heart of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-nuclei-of-atoms-at-the-heart-of-matter/" target="_blank">first of these articles</a> is done.  In it I describe why it was so easy (relatively speaking) to figure out that nuclei are made from certain numbers of protons and neutrons, and how it was understood that nuclei are very small compared to atoms.   Comments welcome as always!</p>
<p>A related article, which should appear later this week, will clarify why nuclei are so tiny relative to atoms, and describe the force of nature that keeps them intact.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s been a lot of reporting recently on a puzzle in particle physics that I haven&#8217;t previously written about. There have been two attempts, a preliminary one in 2010 and <a href="http://www.psi.ch/media/proton-size-puzzle-reinforced" target="_blank">a more detailed one reported just this month</a>, to measure the size of a proton by studying the properties of an exotic atom, called &#8220;muonic hydrogen&#8221;. Similar to <a title="Atoms: Building Blocks of Molecules" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/atoms-building-blocks-of-molecules/" target="_blank">hydrogen</a>, which consists of a proton orbited by an <a title="Electrons: On the Outskirts of Atoms" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/electrons-on-the-outskirts-of-atoms/" target="_blank">electron</a> (Figure 1), this atom consists of a <a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/" target="_blank">proton</a> and a short-lived heavy cousin of the electron, called the <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">muon</a> (Figure 2). A muon, as far as we have ever been able to tell, is just like an electron in all respects except that it is heavier; more precisely, <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the electromagnetic force and the strong and weak nuclear force</a> treat electrons and muons in exactly the same way. Only the first two of these forces should play a role in atoms (and neither gravity nor any force due to the <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">Higgs field</a> should matter either). So because we have confirmed our understanding of ordinary hydrogen with very high precision, we believe we also understand muonic hydrogen very well also.  But something&#8217;s amiss.<span id="more-5502"></span></p>

The forces holding the atom together are the same, but the larger mass of the muon makes the atom smaller, and more sensitive to the (still relatively tiny) size of the proton.</p></div>
<p>Since the muon is about 200 times heavier than the electron, muonic hydrogen is about 200 times smaller (across) than ordinary hydrogen.  <em>[For an argument as to why, see the end of <a title="Atoms: Their Inner Workings" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/atoms-building-blocks-of-molecules/atoms-their-inner-workings/" target="_blank">this article</a>.]</em> And so the proton, which has a diameter about 60,000 times smaller than ordinary hydrogen, is only <strong>300</strong> times smaller than muonic hydrogen. That makes the details of muonic hydrogen more sensitive to the proton&#8217;s size, and thus allows for a more precise measurement.<br />
<em> </em></p>
<p>How is this done? On the experimental side, the experimenters use a laser whose energy per photon can be adjusted, and they measure the energy of photons needed to make muonic hydrogen transition from one state to another (similar to what is shown in Figure 3).<em> [In quantum mechanics, atoms and other similar systems can only exist in very particular states, each one with a very particular mass, shape, size, and other properties.]</em> Only photons of precisely the right energy will do the job for a particular transition. On the theoretical side, one uses known properties of protons, muons, and electromagnetic forces, etc., and (treating the proton&#8217;s size as completely unknown) one calculates carefully what the energy of the required laser photons is expected to be.  The answer depends on the proton&#8217;s unknown size, so by requiring the calculation agrees with the measurement, one learns what the proton&#8217;s size is! Or rather, one learns this <em>as long as one assumes</em></p>
<ul>
<li>the measurement was done accurately,</li>
<li>the calculation contains no errors,</li>
<li>and no important effects were left out of the calculation.</li>
</ul>

(The state of lowest energy is called the &#8220;ground&#8221; state; all others are called &#8220;excited states.)  The same technique works for a muonic atom. Specific transitions (not shown) have been used in the case of muonic hydrogen, while many different transitions have been used for ordinary hydrogen.</p></div>
<p>The reason for the recent excitement is that a similar technique for measuring the proton&#8217;s size has been used many times for transitions between states of ordinary hydrogen, and <strong><em>it gives a different answer</em></strong>. It is far less precise, but has been done many different ways, so the average of all the different measurements is estimated to be only 10 times less precise than the new measurements in muonic hydrogen. The value for the proton&#8217;s size obtained from ordinary hydrogen is <strong>about 4% larger</strong> than obtained from muonic hydrogen.  This is illustrated in Figure 4, which is taken from <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1301.0905" target="_blank">a recent useful review article on the subject by Pohl, Gilman, Miller and Pachucki.</a> <em>[Note I have abridged their caption.] </em> More specifically, the measurements based on transitions between states of ordinary hydrogen give an average proton radius of about 0.88 fermi <em>(where a &#8220;fermi&#8221; = femtometer is a quadrillionth of a meter = a thousandth of a millionth of a millionth of a meter = 10</em><sup>-15</sup><em> meters &#8212; and a meter is about 39 inches.</em>) The uncertainty on this result is claimed to be 0.01 fermi.  The measurements based on muonic hydrogen transitions give an answer of 0.84 fermi, with a much smaller uncertainty.  Precise numbers (valid before the recent improved muon-based result) are given in Figure 4.<em><br />

<p>Meanwhile, there&#8217;s another strategy for measuring the proton&#8217;s size, using high-energy electrons which fly into hydrogen gas and occasionally scatter off the protons deep within the hydrogen atoms (Figure 5.) By looking at the pattern of energies and directions of the scattered electrons, physicists can infer the size of the proton. And the answer they obtain, though again not as precise as obtained from <em>muonic</em> hydrogen, is about as precise and gives about the same answer as that obtained from transitions between states of <em>ordinary</em> hydrogen: 0.88 fermi.  This is illustrated in Figure 6, taken from <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1301.0905" target="_blank">the same recent review article.</a></p>

The energy of the electrons is chosen low enough that the proton is not itself greatly distorted or shattered. By studying the probability of and the pattern of scattering, scientists can determine the size of the proton.</p></div>
<p>This is not a dramatic difference &#8212; it represents only a 4% discrepancy. But the previous measurements of the proton radius were believed to be precise to about 0.9% (for a single standard deviation.) So the new measurements differ from the average of the old ones by a relatively large amount, which the authors state is about 7 standard deviations<em> [though how this number was obtained is obscure to me currently.  Presumably it is explained clearly in <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/339/6118/417" target="_blank">the published paper</a>, which is in Science Magazine.  I will try to clarify this point later today if I can.]</em></p>
<p>Well, 7 standard deviations (or &#8220;sigmas&#8221;) is far more than the 3 to 5 standard deviations that are typically considered impressive. However, one should remember that statistically significant results simply imply discovery of either (a) something about nature or (b) a human error&#8230; with the latter always more likely. The famous <a title="This Time, ICARUS Really DOES Refute OPERA" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/16/this-time-icarus-really-does-refute-opera/" target="_blank">faster-than-light neutrinos disagreed with Einstein&#8217;s prediction by 6 standard deviations</a>, and all that meant was that someone made a mistake.</p>

A variety of measurements (and reanalyses thereof) of the proton radius, by year.  Most of them were made in hydrogen state transitions and in electron-proton scattering experiments.  Almost all recent non-muonic measurements are somewhat above the muonic hydrogen measurement, which lies near the words &#8220;muonic hydrogen&#8221; and is much more precise than all previous measurements.  The most recent muonic hydrogen measurement is not shown, but is consistent with and even more precise than the one shown.</p></div>
<p>Now the most exciting and revolutionary explanation (but, in my current view, very unlikely) for this disagreement would be a new force or other new phenomenon that affects muons and not electrons (or affects exotic small atoms more strongly than ones of ordinary size.) Its presence would foul up the proton size measurement by changing muonic hydrogen slightly, in a way that is not accounted for in the theory calculation that is needed for extracting the proton&#8217;s size.</p>
<p><span style="color:#993366;">[Note Added: It is extremely unlikely indeed that there could be an unknown force powerful enough to <strong>actually</strong> change the proton&#8217;s size!  Such a force would have to counter the strong nuclear force that sets the size of the proton, and anything so large would have been observed decades ago, in other experiments.  No; instead, what is most plausible is a wimpy force whose small effects subtly change the relationship between the <em>measurement</em> and the <em>calculation that is done to <strong>infer</strong> the proton&#8217;s size</em> from that measurement.  Then the proton has only one size, but the size wasn&#8217;t properly extracted from one of the measurements because a small effect was left out.]<br />

<p>But a number of my colleagues have shown, in various ways, that to introduce a new force that would affect muonic hydrogen by this amount, and not muck up previous measurements of the properties of muons or electrons or protons or neutrons, and not show up in the decays of other well-studied particles, is extremely difficult; it requires arranging multiple cancellations between multiple effects, at a level that is highly unpalatable. Maybe I&#8217;ll write about this at a later time, but I warn you that you won&#8217;t like what you see.  You can find relevant references in section 4.5 of the Pohl et al. review.</p>
<p>On top of this difficulty, the discrepancy is not (in my personal view) as crisp as it looks at first glance. The calculations required to extract the proton&#8217;s size are very complicated indeed, and have many ingredients and steps; the measurements are not very sensitive to the proton&#8217;s size, so highly precise measurements and a heck of a lot of theoretical processing are both needed before one can extract the desired information. (In the Pohl et al. review, the authors, merely to summarize the various calculations that are needed and have been performed, require well over a dozen densely written and highly technical pages.) At certain stages along the way, experts might perhaps have been a bit 0verly optimistic about how well their methods work, and if so, perhaps the resulting theoretical uncertainty in one of the proton&#8217;s size measurements is underestimated. Given the complexities and subtleties, which lie outside my expertise, the best I can do is warn you that the Pohl et al. review does point out some potential concerns. Here&#8217;s a quotation: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">To summarize, the apparently simple problem of determining the slope of the form factor at Q<sup>2</sup> = 0 <em>[which is needed to extract the proton radius from electron-proton scattering]</em> has numerous potential pitfalls. The weight of the evidence at this point continues to favor a larger radius, about 0.88 fm, but suggests that claiming an uncertainty at the 0.01 fm level is optimistic</span>.&#8221; This is not the only issue where questions are raised, though without firm conclusions.  It does mean one should remain cautious.  A discrepancy of 7 standard deviations sounds like a lot; but if you underestimated an important source of systematic uncertainties by a factor of 2 or 3, your 7 standard deviations could drop to an unimpressive 3.5 or 2 in a big hurry. So a very careful reconsideration of the uncertainties is necessary.</p>
<p>Fortunately many additional related measurements (discussed in section 5 of the Pohl et al. review) are being planned, and collectively these should help clarify and perhaps resolve this puzzle. Meanwhile the relevant theorists are clearly working hard to check previous calculations and assure that the limitations on their methods are properly accounted for.</p>
<p>At this point I am not optimistic that this discrepancy has a profound origin. But hey &#8212; you never really know for certain until the situation is satisfactorily settled &#8212; so we&#8217;ll need to keep a close eye on this puzzle as it evolves.  There&#8217;s a very low but non-zero probability that it is of great importance. And if it is, I personally doubt anyone has yet thought of the reason.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been quite busy with some physics research this week, but I have nevertheless managed to finish <a title="Electrons: On the Outskirts of Atoms" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/electrons-on-the-outskirts-of-atoms/" target="_blank">a new article on electrons</a>, part of my <a title="The Structure of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/" target="_blank">Structure of Matter</a> series, which aims (among other things) to introduce a non-expert to particle physics, step-by-step.  The completion of this article feels like a significant step for this website.  After all, the electron was the first subatomic particle and the first of <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the apparently-elementary particles</a> to be discovered, about 115 years ago, and its discovery really gave birth to the field of particle physics we know today.  Moreover, it was the failure to describe the behavior of electrons within and outside of atoms that forced physicists to go beyond Newtonian views of physics processes, and introduce the theory of quantum mechanics.  Electrons, tiny as they are, are enormous in human life; they play a key role in all chemical reactions, including those that sustain our bodies.  Beyond that, they lie at the heart of much modern technology &#8212; electronics!  And there&#8217;s more.  So no particle physics website can be complete without an electron webpage.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, a question I sometimes get asked is whether I&#8217;m sure electrons (or any other elementary particles that physicists talk about) really exist.  After all, it is true I&#8217;ve never seen a picture of one taken with any sort of microscope!  Well, in answer to this question, I want to write an article on why we particle physicists are so confident that electrons (and atomic nuclei) exist&#8230; explaining the types of experiments and the types of logical reasoning that lead to this conclusion.  I suspect a lot of readers will find such an article interesting; after all, why should one take expert knowledge for granted just because it appears in a textbook or on a website?  Readers should demand to know where the knowledge came from &#8212; and a writer should be prepared to answer.</p>
