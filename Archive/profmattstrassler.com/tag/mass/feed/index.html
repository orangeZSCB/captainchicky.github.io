										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<pre><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Appropriate for General Readership</em></span></pre>
<p><em>[Apologies: due to a computer glitch, the figure in the original version of this post was not the most up-to-date, and had typos, now fixed.]</em></p>
<p> On Tuesday, the New York Times Editorial page ran an Op-Ed about dark matter&#8230; and although it could have been worse, it could certainly have been better. &nbsp;I do wonder why these folks don&#8217;t just call up an expert and confirm that they&#8217;ve actually got it right, before they mislead the public and give scientists a combination of a few giggles and a headache.</p>
<p>Here is the last paragraph from the Times:</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="color:#339966;">This experiment is probing a major hole in the way we understand the cosmos. Roughly speaking, the force of gravity in the universe can be explained only by a corresponding amount of mass, or matter. Some undiscovered mass — dark matter — must exist in order to explain gravity, but no one has seen any traces of it. Those traces, when they are finally found, will be exotic particles left over from the Big Bang. In the tale we tell about everything we know, scientists have now brought us to the edge of the deep, dark woods. They, and we, are waiting eagerly to see how the rest of the story goes.</span>&#8221;</p>
<p>Ok, out comes the professorial red pen.</p>
<p>First, a relatively minor point of order. &#8220;<span style="color:#339966;">&#8230;the force of gravity in the universe can be explained only by a corresponding amount of mass, or matter&#8230;</span>&#8221; This isn&#8217;t great writing, because mass and matter are not the same thing. Matter is a <em><strong>type</strong></em> of substance. Mass is a <strong><em>property</em></strong> that substance (including ordinary matter, such as tables and planets) can have. Mass and matter are as different as apples and applets. You can read about these distinctions <a title="Mass, Energy, Matter,&nbsp;Etc." href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/" target="_blank">here</a>, if you like. The author is trying to evade this distinction to keep things simple: the more correct statement is that gravity (in simple circumstances) is a force exerted by things (including ordinary matter) that have mass.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s the real offending remark: &#8220;<span style="color:#339966;">Some undiscovered mass — dark matter — must exist in order to explain gravity, but no one has seen any traces of it.</span>&#8221; Dark matter is most certainly <strong>not</strong> needed to &#8220;explain gravity&#8221; in some general way; there&#8217;s not one bit of truth in that remark. For instance, the gravitational pull of the sun on the earth (and vice versa), and the pull of the earth on you and me (and vice versa), has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with dark matter, nor is dark matter needed to explain it.</p>
<p>What the author should have said is: since the 1960s we have known that gravitational forces on large astronomical scales seem to be stronger than we can account for, and so either our equations for gravity are wrong or there is matter out there, pulling on things gravitationally, that we cannot see with any type of telescope. &nbsp;The reason the latter possibility is taken more seriously than the former by most experts is that attempts to modify gravity have not led to a convincing case, while the evidence for additional &#8220;dark&#8221; matter has grown very strong over recent decades.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s one of the several arguments that suggest the possibility of dark matter&#8230; the simplest to explain. Experts study the motions of the stars in our own galaxy &#8212; the star city known as the Milky Way &#8212; and also study the motions of stars in other <a href="http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120518.html" target="_blank">galaxies</a>. [The overall motions of galaxies themselves, inside <a href="http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2003/01" target="_blank">giant clusters of galaxies</a> which can be found in deep space, are also studied.] Now what we ask is this; see Figure 1. Supposing all of the matter that is out there in the universe is of a type that we can see in one way or another: stars, gas, dust of various types. Then we can figure out, just by looking with a telescope and doing simple calculations, roughly how much measurable matter is in each galaxy, how much mass that matter has, and where it is distributed inside the galaxy. &nbsp;We can next use that information to figure out how hard that matter pulls on other matter, via the force of gravity. And finally &#8212; crucially! &#8212; we can calculate how fast that pull will make the matter move, on average. &nbsp;And what do we find when we measure how fast the stars are moving? Our calculations based on the matter that we can see are <strong>wrong</strong>. We find that the stars in the outer edges of a galaxy, and the galaxies inside clusters, are moving much, much faster than our calculation predicts. (This was discovered in the 1960s by <a href="http://www.amnh.org/education/resources/rfl/web/essaybooks/cosmic/p_rubin.html" target="_blank">Vera Rubin and Kent Ford</a>.) &nbsp;It&#8217;s as though they&#8217;re being pulled on by something unseen &#8212; as though the gravity on the stars due to the rest of the galaxy is stronger than we&#8217;ve guessed. Why is this happening?</p>

<p>One possibility is that there is matter out there that we can&#8217;t see, a lot of it, and that matter is inside galaxies and inside clusters of galaxies, exerting a pull that we haven&#8217;t accounted for properly. A huge &#8220;halo&#8221; of dark matter, in this view, surrounds every galaxy (Figure 2).</p>
<p>Clearly, this isn&#8217;t the only logical possibility. Another option is that there could be something wrong with our understanding of gravity. Or there could be some other new force that we don&#8217;t know about yet that has nothing to do with gravity. Or maybe there&#8217;s something wrong with the very laws of motion that we use. But all attempts to make sensible suggestions along these lines have gradually run into conflicts with astronomical observations over the recent decades.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, during those last few decades, a simple version of the &#8220;dark matter&#8221; hypothesis has passed test after test, some of these tests being very complex and subtle. For example, in Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity, gravity pulls on light, and can bend it much the same way that the lenses in eyeglasses bend light. A galaxy or galaxy cluster can serve to magnify objects behind it, and by studying <a href="http://www.space.com/14481-hubble-photo-brightest-galaxy-gravitational-lens.html" target="_blank">these lensing effects</a>, we again conclude there&#8217;s far more matter in galaxies and in clusters than we can see. &nbsp;And there are other arguments too, which I won&#8217;t cover now.</p>
<p>So while an explanation for the fast motion of stars inside galaxies, and galaxies inside clusters, isn&#8217;t 100% sure to be dark matter, it&#8217;s now, after many years of study, in the high 90%s. Don&#8217;t let anyone tell you that scientists rushed to judgment about this; it has been studied for decades, and I can tell you from experience that there&#8217;s a lot more consensus now than there was when I was an beginning undergraduate 30 years ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="color:#339966;">Those traces, when they are finally found, will be exotic particles left over from the Big Bang.</span>&#8221; Will they? Will the dark matter turn out to be particles from the Big Bang? Not necessarily. We know that&#8217;s one possibility, but it&#8217;s not the only one. Since <a title="Questions and Answers About Dark Matter&nbsp;post-LUX" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/31/questions-and-answers-about-dark-matter-post-lux/" target="_blank">I explained this point last week</a>, I&#8217;ll just refer you to that post.</p>
<p>Now here come the big meta-questions: should the New York Times be more careful about what it puts on its editorial page? Should its editors, who are not scientists, talk broadly about a subtle scientific topic without fact-checking with an expert? What are the costs and benefits when they put out oversimplified, and in some ways actually false, information about science on their editorial page?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Personal and professional activities require me to take a short break from posting.  But I hope, whether you&#8217;re a novice with no knowledge of physics, or you&#8217;re a current, former, or soon-to-be scientist or engineer, or you&#8217;re somewhere between, that you can find plenty of articles of interest to you on this site.  A couple of reminders and pointers:</p>
<p>* If you haven&#8217;t yet seen my one-hour talk for a general audience, &#8220;The Quest for the Higgs Boson&#8221;, intended to explain <em>accurately</em> what the <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">Higgs field and particle</a> are all about, while avoiding the most common misleading short-cuts, <a title="Movie Clips" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/videoclips/" target="_blank">it&#8217;s available now</a>, along with a 20-minute question and answer session.</p>
<p>* If you want a slightly more technical and written discussion of the Higgs field and particle, complete with animated images, and suitable for people who may once have had a semester or two of university physics and math, try <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/fields-and-their-particles-with-math/" target="_blank">this series</a> of articles first, and then go to <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/how-the-higgs-field-works-with-math/" target="_blank">this series</a>.</p>
<p>* If you&#8217;d like to better understand the language of &#8220;matter&#8221;, &#8220;mass&#8221;, and &#8220;energy&#8221; that is everywhere in popular explanations of science, but eternally confusing because of how different authors choose to talk about these subjects, you might find some useful tips in these articles: <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/more-on-mass/" target="_blank">#1</a>, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/mass-and-energy/" target="_blank">#2</a>, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/matter-and-energy-a-false-dichotomy/" target="_blank">#3</a>, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/the-energy-that-holds-things-together/" target="_blank">#4</a>.</p>
<p>* If you need a reminder about what &#8220;ordinary matter&#8221; (i.e. things like pickles, people and planets) is made of, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/" target="_blank">try this series</a>, which goes all the way from molecules down to quarks.</p>
<p>* If you&#8217;re curious about what &#8220;particle/<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/what-are-anti-particles/" target="_blank">anti-particle</a> annihilation&#8221; does and doesn&#8217;t mean, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/particleanti-particle-annihilation/" target="_blank">try this article</a>.</p>
<p>* And here are <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the types of particles and forces of nature that we know about</a>, and (for the moderately advanced reader) here&#8217;s <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/the-known-particles-if-the-higgs-field-were-zero/" target="_blank">how they&#8217;d be rearranged if the Higgs field were turned off</a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully there&#8217;s something on that list that interests you, and many links within those articles to other things that may even interest you more.  Have fun exploring!  And stay tuned; I&#8217;ll be writing more in the near future&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the challenges for a person trying to explain physics to the non-expert &#8212; and for non-experts themselves &#8212; is that scientific language and concepts are often frustratingly confusing. Often two words are used for the same thing, sometimes <a title="Virtual Particles: What are they?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/virtual-particles-what-are-they/">words are used that are fundamentally misleading</a>, and often <a title="Matter and Energy: A False Dichotomy" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/matter-and-energy-a-false-dichotomy/">a single word is used for two very different but related concepts</a>. You&#8217;d think we&#8217;d clear this stuff up, but no one has organized a committee dedicated to streamlining and refining our terminology.</p>
<p>A deeply unfortunate case, the subject of today&#8217;s post, is the word &#8220;mass&#8221;. Mass was confusing before Einstein, and then Einstein came along and (accidentally) left the word mass with two different definitions&#8230; both of which you&#8217;ll see in first-year university textbooks. (Indeed, this confusion even extended to physicists more broadly, causing the famous particle physicist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev_Okun" target="_blank">Lev Okun</a> to <a href="http://www.itep.ru/theor/persons/lab180/okun/em_3.pdf" target="_blank">make this issue into a cause celebre&#8230;</a>) And it all has to do with how you interpret E = mc² &#8212; the only equation everybody knows &#8212; which relates <em>the energy stored in an object</em> to the <em>mass of the object</em> times the <em>square</em> of the <em>universal speed limit</em> c, also known as &#8220;the speed of light&#8221;.</p>
<p>Here are the two possible interpretations of this equation. <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Modern particle physicists </strong>(including me)<strong> only use the first interpretation.</strong></span> The purpose of this post is to alert you to this fact, and to point you to <a title="The Two Definitions of “Mass”, And Why I Use Only One" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/more-on-mass/the-two-definitions-of-mass-and-why-i-use-only-one/" target="_blank">an article where I explain more carefully why we do it this way</a>.<span id="more-6242"></span></p>
<p><strong>Interpretation 1.</strong> <span style="color:#008000;">E = mc² is true only for an object that isn&#8217;t moving.</span> For an object that is moving, E is <em><strong>greater</strong></em> than mc². <em>Energy and mass are not at all the same thing</em>; an object&#8217;s energy can change when its motion changes, but its mass never changes. This notion of mass is sometimes called &#8220;rest mass&#8221; (since it&#8217;s related to the energy stored in the object when it is &#8220;at rest&#8221;) or &#8220;invariant mass&#8221; (since it doesn&#8217;t change when it is moving.)</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation 2.</strong> <span style="color:#800080;">E = mc² is <em><strong>always</strong></em> true, for both stationary and moving objects.</span> This can be viewed as saying <em>energy and mass are essentially the same thing</em>. [Recall that in interpretation 1, they are <strong>not at all</strong> the same thing.] Since the energy of a moving object is larger than when it is stationary, that means, similarly, that its mass is larger when it is moving than when it is stationary. This notion of mass is sometimes called &#8220;relativistic mass&#8221;, in honor of Einstein&#8217;s revolutionary notions of relativity.</p>
<p>To sum up &#8212; <span style="color:#800080;"><em>relativistic mass</em></span> depends on how fast an object is moving, but <span style="color:#008000;"><em>invariant mass/rest mass</em></span> is the same whether an object is moving or not; you can see this in the figure below.  Which one of these should we call &#8220;mass&#8221;, with no modifier?  Unfortunately, that&#8217;s up to the user.</p>

Note the two are almost identical at small velocities, and so are usually equal in daily life.</p></div>
<p>Fortunately, in daily life, these two concepts are almost identical, because most objects we observe in daily life much more slowly than c, in which case their rest mass and relativistic mass are nearly identical, as you can see in the figure. But particle physicists and nuclear physicists and astronomers, among others, often have to be more precise. And when you&#8217;re reading an article or book about particles or nuclei or astronomy in which &#8220;mass&#8221; plays an important role, you will often need to know which of these two interpretations is being used by the author!</p>
<p>Einstein, in his early years, contributed to the second interpretation, perhaps inadvertently.  But later he made clear statements <em>(most notably in a letter to Lincoln Barnett, which I can&#8217;t find in full on the web, but which is quoted widely)</em> in favor of the first  interpretation. Not that Einstein&#8217;s opinion particularly matters; in science we respect our elders, but we do not slavishly follow them, the way people used to follow Aristotle. We come to a conclusion based on what we know, and often we know things that weren&#8217;t known to the previous generations.  So why do particle physicists today choose interpretation 1? I&#8217;ll give you a couple of quick hints as to why, and if you want to learn more, you can <a title="The Two Definitions of “Mass”, And Why I Use Only One" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/more-on-mass/the-two-definitions-of-mass-and-why-i-use-only-one/" target="_blank">read my article on the matter</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#008000;">If you use the first definition,</span></span>
<ul>
<li><strong>all</strong> photons <em>(particles of light)</em> have zero mass,</li>
<li>all <a title="Atoms: Their Inner Workings" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/atoms-building-blocks-of-molecules/atoms-their-inner-workings/" target="_blank">hydrogen atoms</a> have the <strong>same</strong> mass: 0.938 <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#008000;">GeV</span></a>/c²</li>
<li>all <a title="Electrons: On the Outskirts of Atoms" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/electrons-on-the-outskirts-of-atoms/" target="_blank">electrons</a> have a mass which much <strong>smaller</strong> than that of a hydrogen atom.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="color:#800080;"><span style="color:#800080;">If you use the second definition,</span></span>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>no</strong></em> photons have zero mass (because all photons have energy)</li>
<li>every hydrogen atom has a <strong><em>different</em></strong> mass, depending on how fast it is moving; and</li>
<li>any particular electron may have a <strong><em>smaller or larger</em></strong> mass than any given hydrogen atom, depending on how fast each of them is moving. <em> [For instance, an electron emitted by a decaying <a title="Decays of the Standard Model Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/decays-of-the-standard-model-higgs/" target="_blank">Higgs particle</a> has a larger mass than the hydrogen atoms in your body (at least from your point of view).]</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So with the second interpretation, you can&#8217;t even say which types of particles have larger masses than other types, and it is impossible for any type of particle to be massless.  This is very inconvenient &#8212; one might even say, ridiculous &#8212; for doing particle physics.</p>
<p>Additional subtle but profound mathematical reasons <span style="color:#888888;"><em>[having to do with the &#8220;hyperbolic geometry of space-time&#8221;, if you must know]</em></span> support the first interpretation, as hinted at in <a title="Mass and Energy" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/mass-and-energy/" target="_blank">this article on mass and energy</a>, which shows how energy, momentum and mass are related by elegant equations if you use the first interpretation.</p>
<p>Anyway, as long as you are aware of the existence of these two different interpretations, you will usually be able to tell which one is in use by an author. <strong><em> <span style="color:#ff0000;">On this website, the <span style="color:#008000;">first interpretation</span> is always used.</span></em></strong><span style="color:#ff0000;"><span style="color:#000000;">    If you would like to learn more about why particle physicists choose the first interpretation, <a title="The Two Definitions of “Mass”, And Why I Use Only One" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/more-on-mass/the-two-definitions-of-mass-and-why-i-use-only-one/" target="_blank">click here for my more detailed article</a>.</span></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Posts have been notably absent, due mainly to travel with very limited internet; apologies for the related lack of replies to comments, which I hope to correct later this week.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I&#8217;ve been working on a couple of articles related to the nuclei of atoms, part of my <a title="The Structure of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/" target="_blank">Structure of Matter series,</a> which serves to introduce non-experts to <a title="Particle Physics Basics" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/" target="_blank">the basics of particle physics.</a>  The <a title="The Nuclei of Atoms: At the Heart of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-nuclei-of-atoms-at-the-heart-of-matter/" target="_blank">first of these articles</a> is done.  In it I describe why it was so easy (relatively speaking) to figure out that nuclei are made from certain numbers of protons and neutrons, and how it was understood that nuclei are very small compared to atoms.   Comments welcome as always!</p>
<p>A related article, which should appear later this week, will clarify why nuclei are so tiny relative to atoms, and describe the force of nature that keeps them intact.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m therefore writing <a title="Taking Stock of the “Higgs” (Jan. 2013)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/taking-stock-of-the-higgs-jan-2013/" target="_blank">an article that tries to put the questions about the Higgs-like particle into a sensible order, and then draws upon the talks that were given at the Symposium to provide the current best answers</a>. About half of the article is done, and you&#8217;re welcome to read it.  Due to other commitments, I won&#8217;t probably get back to finish it until next week.  But &#8220;Part 1&#8221; is long enough that it will take some time for most readers to absorb anyway&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a post about constancy and inconstancy, one of my favorite topics.  And about how alcohol can make you smarter.</p>
<p>There are many quantities that we call &#8220;constants of nature&#8221;.  Of course, anything we call a &#8220;constant&#8221; is merely something that, empirically, <em>appears</em> to be constant, to the extent we can measure it.  Everything we know comes from observation and experiment, and our knowledge is always limited by how good our measurements are.</p>
<p>We have pretty good evidence that a number of basic physical quantities are pretty much constant.  A lot of evidence comes from the constancy of the colors of light waves (i.e. the frequencies of waves of electromagnetic radiation) that are emitted by different types of atoms, which appear to be very much the same from day to day and year to year and even across billions of years (neat trick! will describe that another time), and from here to the next country and on to the moon and to the sun and across our galaxy to distant galaxies.  For example, if the electron mass changed very much over time and place, or if the strength of the electromagnetic force varied, then atoms, and the precise colors they emit, would also change.  Since we haven&#8217;t ever detected such an effect, it makes sense to think of the electron mass and the electromagnetic force&#8217;s strength as constants of nature.</p>
<p>But they&#8217;re not necessarily <em>exactly</em> constant.  One can always imagine they vary slowly enough across time or place that we wouldn&#8217;t have noticed it yet, with our current experimental technology.  So it makes sense to look at very distant places and measure whatever we can to seek signs that maybe, just maybe, some of the constants actually vary after all.</p>
<p><em>[I wrote <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ph/0112233.pdf" target="_blank">a paper in 2001 with Paul Langacker and Gino Segre</a> about this subject (<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ph/0112110v4.pdf" target="_blank"><em>Calmet and Fritzsch had a similar one</em></a>).  This followed the observational claims of <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0012539" target="_blank">this paper</a> (now thought false) suggesting the strength of electromagnetism varies across the universe and/or with time.  A lot of what follows in this post is based on what I learned writing that old paper.]</em></p>
<p>Suppose they did vary?  Well, the discovery of any variation whatsoever, in any quantity, would be a bombshell, and it would open up a door to an entirely new area of scientific research.  Once one quantity were known to vary, it would be much more plausible that others vary too.  For instance, if the electron mass varies, why not the W particle&#8217;s mass, which affects the strength of the weak nuclear force, and thereby radioactivity rates and the properties of supernovas?  If the electromagnetic force strength varies, why not that of the strong nuclear force?  There would be interest in understanding whether the variation is over space, over time, or both.  Is it continuous and slow, or does it occur in jumps?  One can imagine dozens of new experiments that would be proposed to study these questions &#8212; and the answers might reveal relations among the laws and &#8220;constants&#8221; of nature that we are currently completely unaware of, as well as giving us new insights into the history of the universe.</p>
<p>So it would be a very big deal.  <em>[Though I should note it would also be puzzling: even small variations in these constants would naively lead to large variations in the &#8220;dark energy&#8221; (i.e. cosmological &#8220;constant&#8221;) of the universe, which would potentially make the universe very inhomogeneous.  However, we don&#8217;t understand dark energy, so this expectation might be too naive.]</em> Since there&#8217;s no story about it on the front page of the New York Times, you can already guess that no variation&#8217;s been found.  But a nice new measurement&#8217;s been done.<span id="more-5212"></span></p>
<p><strong>The New Measurement</strong></p>
<p>The punchline: the nice new measurement of one especially interesting quantity &#8212; the ratio of the mass of the electron to the mass of the proton &#8212; shows no sign of variation, to much better precision than was possible ever before, and looking halfway across the universe.</p>
<p>Specifically, a group from Amsterdam and Bonn, consisting of Julija Bagdonaite, Paul Jansen, Christian Henkel, Hendrick L. Bethlem, Karl M. Menten, and Wim Ubachs, has written <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2012/12/12/science.1224898" target="_blank">a paper whose abstract claims</a>: &#8220;we set a limit on a possible cosmological variation of the proton-to-electron mass ratio <em>μ</em> by comparing transitions in methanol observed in the early universe with those measured in the laboratory. Based on radio-astronomical observations of PKS1830-211, we deduced a constraint of ∆<em>μ</em>/<em>μ</em> = (0.0 ± 1.0) × 10<sup>−7</sup> at redshift z = 0.89, corresponding to a look-back time of 7 billion years.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, since the universe is 13.7 billion years old, they are looking at galaxies that are so far away that it has taken half the universe&#8217;s age for the light from those galaxies to make it to Earth&#8230; which means they are halfway across the visible universe, by some measure.  And they are looking at electromagnetic radiation (in radio wavelengths) emitted by the molecule known as methanol, which isn&#8217;t a type of alcohol you would want to drink, but you might <a href="http://www.methanol.org/" target="_blank">want to burn</a>.  They&#8217;re comparing what&#8217;s emitted by methanol in galaxies far, far away with what methanol emits on earth, and they can&#8217;t find any difference, to one part in 10 million.</p>
<p>This result is actually much more interesting and powerful than it sounds, because <strong>the ratio of the electron mass to the proton mass is sensitive to several important quantities in nature</strong>.  So the measurement gives evidence against variation in numerous interesting constants of nature.  Let me now explain why this is true, by explaining briefly where the electron mass and the proton mass come from.  They have remarkably different origins.</p>
<p><strong>The Electron Mass</strong></p>
<p>Within the Standard Model of particle physics <em>(the simplest equations for <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the known particles and forces</a> that are consistent with current data &#8212; and for the purposes of this post I&#8217;ll assume the Standard Model is accurate and appropriate)</em> the electron mass is the product of two quantities:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">non-zero value of the Higgs field</a>, whose presence <a title="Why the Higgs and Gravity are Unrelated" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/10/15/why-the-higgs-and-gravity-are-unrelated/" target="_blank">gives mass to all the known <em>elementary</em> particles (but not the proton</a>, which isn&#8217;t elementary! see below.)</li>
<li>the strength of the interaction between the electron and the Higgs field, called the &#8220;electron Yukawa coupling&#8221;.  <em>(This interaction is quite weak, which is why the electron is one of the lightest known elementary particles.)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>So the electron mass is pretty simple; it depends mainly on just two quantities.</p>
<p><strong>The Proton Mass</strong></p>
<p>The proton mass is quite a bit more subtle!  There are several important ingredients, and they don&#8217;t enter in a simple way.</p>
<p>First, you may have heard that a proton is made of two up quarks and a down quark; you can find this statement everywhere.  But <a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/" target="_blank">this is a white lie; a proton is vastly more complicated than this</a>. Indeed, the up and down quarks are much lighter than a proton is: the up and down quark masses are only 0.004 and 0.008 GeV/c² (with big uncertainties, because they&#8217;re really hard to measure) whereas the proton has a mass of 0.938 GeV/c²!   If the white lie were true, then the proton&#8217;s mass would be given roughly by adding the down quark&#8217;s mass to twice the up quark&#8217;s mass.  <strong>But it&#8217;s not.</strong>  In fact, if the up and down quark&#8217;s masses were both doubled, there would barely be any effect on the proton&#8217;s mass at all!  And here we&#8217;ll only be considering variations far below one part in a million.</p>
<p>So what <em><strong>does</strong></em> give the proton its mass?</p>
<p>The mass of the proton is set by a curious and crucial feature of the strong nuclear force.  If you pull two electrically charged objects apart, the electric force between them will become weaker and weaker, falling as one over the distance squared.  However, the strong nuclear force is different, as shown in Figure 1. if you take a quark and an antiquark that are extremely microscopically close together, the strong nuclear force between them will first become weaker, but then, at about a distance of a tenth of a millionth of a millionth of a centimeter<em> (a centimeter is a bit more than 1/3 of an inch)</em>, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/jets-the-manifestation-of-quarks-and-gluons/" target="_blank">the force will stop decreasing</a>.  Well, that special distance is called the &#8220;confinement scale&#8221; (let&#8217;s call it &#8220;R&#8221;), and at larger distances the &#8220;confinement force&#8221; holds the quark and antiquark together in a constant and firm grip from which <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/jets-the-manifestation-of-quarks-and-gluons/" target="_blank">they cannot (directly) escape</a>.</p>

<p>Now how do we figure out the proton mass from this?  Roughly speaking, trapping quarks and antiquarks and gluons in a little sphere with radius about equal to the confinement scale assures, by the uncertainty principle of Heisenberg, that the amount of energy in that little box will be related to Planck&#8217;s constant h divided by R and by the speed of light c.  You see, Heisenberg tells us that you can&#8217;t know the position and the momentum of a particle at the same time; so if you squeeze down the position of a particle into a sphere of radius R (Figure 2), the particle will, on average, be speeding around with a momentum proportional to 1/R.  So <strong><em>if the proton were to become smaller, its mass would increase. </em></strong> <em>[That&#8217;s a little counter-intuitive, but that&#8217;s how things work in our quantum world!  To make quantum things smaller requires effort and energy; that energy contributes to the mass of the object, since E = mc² (for an object that is stationary.)]</em> Some little details ensue, but basically <strong>the proton mass is proportional to 1/R</strong>; roughly it equals h/(2πcR), times a number which has to be calculated on a computer and turns out to be about 5.</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_233" style="width: 249px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/myproton/" rel="attachment wp-att-233"><img loading="lazy" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-233" data-attachment-id="233" data-permalink="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/myproton/" data-orig-file="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/myproton.jpg" data-orig-size="398,397" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="MyProton" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="&lt;p&gt;Snapshot of a proton (but imagine all of the quarks (u,d,s), antiquarks (same with a bar on them), and gluons rushing around near the speed of light, banging into each other, and appearing and disappearing.  The size of the proton, set by the confinement scale, is inversely proportional to its mass.  (M.Strassler 2010)&lt;/p&gt;
" data-medium-file="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/myproton.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/myproton.jpg?w=398" class=" wp-image-233 " alt="" src="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/myproton.jpg?w=239&#038;h=238" width="239" height="238" srcset="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/myproton.jpg?w=239&amp;h=238 239w, https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/myproton.jpg?w=150&amp;h=150 150w, https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/myproton.jpg?w=300&amp;h=300 300w, https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/myproton.jpg 398w" sizes="(max-width: 239px) 100vw, 239px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-233" class="wp-caption-text">Fig. 2: Snapshot of a proton &#8212; but imagine all of the quarks (u,d,s), antiquarks (same with a bar on top), and gluons rushing around near the speed of light, banging into each other, and appearing and disappearing. The size of the proton, set by the confinement scale, is inversely proportional to its mass. (M.Strassler 2010)</p></div>
<p>So now the question is: since the proton mass is determined by R, <em><strong>what determines R?</strong></em>  Well, that&#8217;s quite interesting.  R turns out to be affected by several more fundamental quantities.  For instance, if you ask: how strong is the strong nuclear force at a distance scale where quantum gravity is important &#8212; the sort of question that theoretical physicists might ask when trying to make a complete theory of the world &#8212; the answer is that R depends exponentially on the answer!  Just a 1% change in the strength of the strong nuclear force at very short distance can lead to a 10% change in R!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not all.  The confinement scale R is also affected somewhat by the masses of the top quark, bottom quark and charm quark, because of subtle effects of their fields (specifically, by effects often called &#8220;<a title="Virtual Particles: What are they?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/virtual-particles-what-are-they/">virtual particles</a>&#8221;) on the way that the strong nuclear force changes with distance.  Like the electron mass, the mass of each quark is related to the quark&#8217;s Yukawa coupling (i.e., how strongly it interacts with the Higgs field) times the non-zero value of the Higgs field.</p>
<p>Putting this altogether, the proton mass is sensitive to</p>
<ul>
<li>The strength of the strong nuclear force at short distances (to which it is very sensitive indeed)</li>
<li>The non-zero value of the Higgs field</li>
<li>The Yukawa couplings of the charm quark, bottom quark and top quark.</li>
<li>And possibly the masses of other particles with strong nuclear forces that we haven&#8217;t yet discovered.</li>
</ul>
<p>Quite a list!</p>
<p><strong>The Implications</strong></p>
<p>In short, the electron mass divided by the proton mass is a quantity determined by a plethora of interesting and more fundamental quantities in nature.  The fact that there is no observable variation, at one part in 10 million across half the universe, in the ratio of the electron mass to the proton mass suggests that there is no variation, more or less at that level, in the short-distance strength of the strong nuclear force, the non-zero value of the Higgs field, and the Yukawa couplings of the electron, the charm quark, the bottom quark, and the top quark. Note: although both the electron mass and the proton mass depend on the value of the Higgs field, their dependence is different, and does not cancel in the ratio of the masses.</p>
<p><em>Of course, it is possible that several of these quantities are varying, and just by chance all the variation cancels out of the electron mass to proton mass ratio.  But there&#8217;s no reason theoretically to expect that to happen; simple equations you might write down for how variations might occur don&#8217;t lead to a big cancellation.  So there&#8217;s a caveat, but it is a small one.</em></p>
<p>Too bad!  A discovery of variation would have changed particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology forever.  Experts will keep looking for variations in other quantities, and improving the precision of their measurements.  But a powerful new result of this type still provides important information, knowledge that scientists will include in their future efforts to understand what underlies our strange, and strangely constant, universe.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes, it was funny, as I hope you enjoyed in my <a title="Particles are People Too" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/12/01/particles-are-people-too/">post from Saturday</a>; but really, when we step back and look at it, something is dreadfully wrong and quite sad.  Somehow TIME magazine, fairly reputable on the whole, in the process of reporting the nomination of a particle<em> (the Higgs Boson; here&#8217;s <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">my FAQ about it</a> and here&#8217;s <a title="Why the Higgs Particle Matters" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/why-the-higgs-particle-matters/" target="_blank">my layperson&#8217;s explanation of why it is important</a>)</em> as a Person (?) of the Year, <a href="http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2128881_2128882_2129214,00.html" target="_blank">explained the nature of this particle with a disastrous paragraph of five astoundingly erroneous sentences</a>.   Treating this as a &#8220;teaching moment&#8221; <em>(yes, always the professor &#8212; can&#8217;t help myself)</em> I want to go through those sentences carefully and fix them, not to string up or further embarrass the journalist but to be useful to my readers.  So that&#8217;s coming in a moment.</p>
<p>But first, a lament.</p>
<p>Who&#8217;s at fault here, and how did this happen?  There&#8217;s plenty of blame to go around; some lies with the journalist, who would have been wise to run his prose past a science journalist buddy; some lies with the editors, who didn&#8217;t do basic fact checking, even of the non-science issues; some lies with a public that (broadly) doesn&#8217;t generally care enough about science for editors to make it a priority to have accurate reporting on the subject.  But there&#8217;s a history here.  How did it happen that we ended up a technological society, relying heavily on the discoveries of modern physics and other sciences over the last century, and yet we have a public that is at once confused by, suspicious of, bored by, and unfamiliar with science?   I think a lot of the blame also lies with scientists, who collectively over generations have failed to communicate both what we do and why it&#8217;s important &#8212; and why it&#8217;s important for journalists not to misrepresent it.<span id="more-5067"></span></p>
<p>On good days I like to think that blogging is a step forward, which allows for much broader, more accurate and more rapid communication with the public and with journalists than was previously possible.  There are many good websites and blogs that can address the physics of the Higgs particle far better than any science magazine or newspaper science section could hope to: these include (but are by no means not limited to) <a href="http://resonaances.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Resonaances</a>, <a href="http://www.quantumdiaries.org/" target="_blank">Quantum Diaries</a>, <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/" target="_blank">Cosmic Variance</a>, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/life-and-physics" target="_blank">Life and Physics</a>, <a href="http://www.science20.com/quantum_diaries_survivor" target="_blank">A Quantum Diaries Survivor</a>, <a href="http://motls.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">The Reference Frame</a>, <a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/" target="_blank">Not Even Wrong</a>, <a href="http://blog.vixra.org/" target="_blank">Vixra</a>, &#8230;  there must be a dozen others. Even though I often disagree with some of the more polemical and extreme bloggers about details of the science &#8212; what is or isn&#8217;t excluded by data, how data ought to be analyzed, what the important issues in the field are &#8212; all of these bloggers are expert enough to get most of the particle physics right most of the time, and readers, by reading the various blogs, can get something of a balanced point of view and figure out what&#8217;s mainstream sensible and what&#8217;s polemic overstatement. <em> [Of course, there are other blogs out there are packed with misleading information about the basic science, but that&#8217;s an issue for another day.] </em> But even collectively, we&#8217;re simply not reaching enough of the public at large yet.  We saw that in the craziness about faster-than-light neutrinos last year.  We&#8217;re seeing it this year with the Higgs particle.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m not alone among the bloggers and book authors in feeling that if the journalist or editors at TIME had ever once read one &#8212; <em>just one</em> &#8212; of the many short articles we&#8217;ve all written for laypersons explaining something about the Higgs particle <em>(e.g., <a title="Why the Higgs Particle Matters" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/why-the-higgs-particle-matters/" target="_blank">Why the Higgs Particle Matters</a>)</em> many of the errors in the TIME piece would never have happened.  How can we collectively get a wider readership, at least among journalists?</p>
<p>Ok.  Here we go.  Here&#8217;s what TIME said, and what&#8217;s wrong with it.  Read it and weep.  Or laugh.  Or both.</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">Take a moment to thank this little particle for all the work it does, because without it,</span></p>
<ul>
<li><a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">The <strong>field</strong>, not the particle, does the job; the particle is just a ripple in that field.</a>  No reason to thank the Higgs particle, except in that it is very useful for providing deeper insight into the nature of the Higgs field.  (Or <em>field<span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>s</strong></span></em>; we don&#8217;t yet know there&#8217;s only one.) But the journalist is making a very common mistake.  As I wrote in <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">the Higgs FAQ</a>, &#8220;&#8230;the Higgs particle gets all the attention, while the poor Higgs field labors in obscurity, protecting the universe from catastrophe but getting none of its deserved credit…&#8221;  And this mis-attribution of credit is, I fear, largely scientists&#8217; fault, because of glib shortcuts taken in explaining things too briefly to journalists and to the public<em>.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">you’d be just inchoate energy without so much as a bit of mass.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Well, this is so wrong it&#8217;s hard to say how it&#8217;s wrong.  Of course, you wouldn&#8217;t <strong>be</strong>, so it&#8217;s hard to say exactly <strong>what</strong> you&#8217;d be.  What would really happen is that your electrons would no longer form atoms with the protons and neutrons in your atomic nuclei, so you&#8217;d explode.  Without the Higgs field, atoms would not form and there could be no ordinary matter; BUT protons and neutrons, composite particles made out of massless elementary ones, would still have a mass.  And since protons and neutrons make up most of <em><strong>your</strong></em> mass, it&#8217;s not true at any level that you would simply turn into massless things.  And massless things aren&#8217;t the same as energy, anyway; see below.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">What’s more, the same would be true for the entire universe.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s not clear what the writer means here, but it&#8217;s certainly not correct. Within the universe, <a title="Why the Higgs and Gravity are Unrelated" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/10/15/why-the-higgs-and-gravity-are-unrelated/" target="_blank">many things with mass, including protons and neutrons but also black holes, and probably dark matter, would maintain their masses even with no Higgs field</a>.  And the mass of the universe <em>(no matter how you might define it, which is not so easy)</em> certainly wouldn&#8217;t shift from non-zero to zero if the Higgs field were turned off.  So this statement doesn&#8217;t make sense.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">It was in the 1960s</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Correct! (phew)</li>

<p><span style="color:#008000;">that Scottish physicist</span></p>
<ul>
<li>English (according to all my sources, including his <a href="http://www.ph.ed.ac.uk/higgs/peter-higgs" target="_blank">CV</a> and Wikipedia &#8212; didn&#8217;t they do any fact-checking at TIME? this wasn&#8217;t difficult&#8230;); works in Scotland</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">Peter Higgs</span></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/jul/04/higgs-boson-nobel-prize-headache" target="_blank">and also Englert and Brout, and also Guralnik, Hagen and Kibble </a>(and actually the history is a lot more subtle even than that); please give these other folks <em>some</em> credit, by saying &#8220;Higgs and others&#8221; or something like that!</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">first posited the existence of a particle</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Field! and then Higgs noted (slightly later) that it would have a particle as a consequence.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">that causes energy to make the jump to matter.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The Higgs field does not cause energy to become matter.  Both the language and the meaning are wrong; the writer has fallen into classic traps that I&#8217;ve written about extensively (see <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/mass-and-energy/" target="_blank">this link</a> and <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/matter-and-energy-a-false-dichotomy/" target="_blank">this link</a>).  What happens when the Higgs field becomes non-zero is that certain types of massless elementary particles end up having some mass.   What&#8217;s wrong with the writer&#8217;s language? <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/matter-and-energy-a-false-dichotomy/" target="_blank">Energy is not the same thing as massless particles</a>; rather, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/mass-and-energy/" target="_blank">energy is something that particles can <em>have</em>, whether they have mass or not</a>.  And &#8220;mass&#8221; and &#8220;matter&#8221; are not the same thing; <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/matter-and-energy-a-false-dichotomy/" target="_blank">&#8220;matter&#8221;, in fact, is ambiguous as a term</a>, but generally is related to the notion of <em>ordinary material</em> made from atoms or their constituents, while <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/mass-and-energy/" target="_blank">mass is again something that particles can <em>have</em>, whether those particles make up matter or not</a>.  <em>[For example, top anti-quarks are not part of matter, <a title="Matter and Energy: A False Dichotomy" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/matter-and-energy-a-false-dichotomy/" target="_blank">by most definitions of &#8220;matter&#8221;</a>, but they certainly have mass! all of it obtained from the Higgs field(s).)]</em> I often feel that physicists do a bad job of making these points clear to the public, and I fear we&#8217;re largely responsible for these confusions, along with high-school science classes.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">But it was not until last summer that a team of researchers at Europe’s Large Hadron Collider — Rolf Heuer, Joseph Incandela and Fabiola Gianotti —</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Oh wow.  TIME OUT!!!   This is bad.  Thousands of people on two huge teams (CMS and ATLAS) worked for many, many years to make this possible; hundreds were directly involved in the discovery.  Yet somehow the writer imagines that this all was carried out by three people?!?  The latter two are the currently-<em>elected spokespersons</em> for their teams, but they are not somehow responsible for the majority of the work (for although they are very highly respected scientists, they couldn&#8217;t possibly have the time!) and the third, Rolf Heuer, who currently directs the CERN laboratory, does not do research on the Large Hadron Collider at all!   What is sad about this is that erases the contribution of many great scientists, and it completely loses sight of what an incredible and historic collaborative effort was involved in this discovery.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">at last sealed the deal and in so doing finally fully confirmed Einstein’s general theory of relativity.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Oh woe.  Oh woe.  Oh calamity.  SO wrong.  Definitely the most disastrous mistake of them all.  There&#8217;s <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/10/15/why-the-higgs-and-gravity-are-unrelated/" target="_blank">zero/zilch/nada/no-way/nothing to connect the Higgs story with gravity</a>, which is what Einstein&#8217;s general relativity is about.  The discovery of the Higgs particle changes nothing in our understanding of general relativity.  And hey, general relativity is <em>already</em> fairly well confirmed (though one never stops testing a theory for weak points; it took hundreds of years to find a weak point in Newton&#8217;s.)  Repeat:<a title="Why the Higgs and Gravity are Unrelated" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/10/15/why-the-higgs-and-gravity-are-unrelated/" target="_blank"> there is no obvious or direct connection between the Higgs field, or its particle, and gravity</a>!  Discovery of the Higgs particle merely represents (partial) confirmation of the idea that the masses of various elementary particles come from a Higgs field (or fields).</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">The Higgs — as particles do —</span></p>
<ul>
<li>as <a title="Most Particles Decay — Yet Some Don’t!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/why-do-particles-decay/most-particles-decay-yet-some-dont/" target="_blank"><em>most but fortunately not all</em></a> particles do &#8212; I suspect the writer meant this, but it&#8217;s not so clear&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">immediately decayed to more-fundamental particles,</span></p>
<ul>
<li>No! This is a common and <em>very natural</em> misconception; the writer is by no means alone in being confused on this point.   Our ordinary daily-life intuition would suggest that fundamental (or &#8220;elementary&#8221;, a term I much prefer) objects should not be able to fall apart into other fundamental objects &#8212; that the ability to fall apart is limited to objects that are composites constructed out of other objects, the way a wall can fall apart into its constituent bricks.  But for particles, <strong><em>decay is not a falling-apart</em></strong>.  It is a transformation.  And so yes, fundamental objects can in fact decay/disintegrate/transform into two or more objects that are just as fundamental (or even may be <em>less</em>-fundamental!)  What is required to make the decay possible is that <a title="Most Particles Decay — Yet Some Don’t!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/why-do-particles-decay/most-particles-decay-yet-some-dont/" target="_blank">the sum of their masses of the decay products is smaller than the mass of the decaying object; a few other rules must be obeyed as well</a>.  Other rules determine whether a particular decay pattern is <em>likely</em>, but that gets more technical.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">but the scientists would surely be happy to collect any honors or awards in its stead.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>True.  But I really think they&#8217;d be a little embarrassed about this award.  I don&#8217;t think a particle should be Person of the Year.  That&#8217;s just plain silly.  Discovery of the Year?  Maybe!</li>
</ul>
<p>Hahaha; ok, we&#8217;ve had our laughs.  But now what I want to know is what more we scientists can do to change a bad situation.  Although the writer and the editors at TIME made avoidable serious errors in this little paragraph, it&#8217;s by no means entirely their fault that this happened. Is there more that we &#8212; scientists and journalists &#8212; can do to open up the communication channels?  Can we work to eliminate some of the inaccurate short-cuts in what we scientists tell the public, often via the journalism community?  How can we make this kind of trust-eroding mistake less likely?</p>
<p>Suggestions welcome.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Robert Garisto sent me a reply to <a title="Does the Higgs Field Give the Higgs Particle Its Mass, or Not?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/10/23/does-the-higgs-field-give-the-higgs-particle-its-mass-or-not/" target="_blank">my previous post</a>; here it is.  [A &#8220;vev&#8221; is shorthand for a non-zero value in the vacuum of space, what I call a &#8220;non-zero average value&#8221;.]</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><em>Matt &#8211; Thanks for your extensive reply to my comment! Of course I agree that a scalar field without a vev can have a hard mass term. And I do agree that how the Higgs boson gets mass is at least somewhat different than how the W does.</em></p>
<p><em> Let&#8217;s agree to define a Higgs as a scalar field with a vev. Then I think you agree that the mass of the excitation about the vev, the Higgs boson, is not a hard mass term, one obtains it by finding the minimum of the potential as you did above. Now if there are other scalars with vevs, the mass of the Higgs boson we are concentrating on can depend on those too. But isn&#8217;t it correct to say that the mass of such a Higgs boson goes to zero in the limit that all of those vevs go to zero? If so, I would say that the Higgs boson mass is provided by the Higgs fields (all scalars with nonzero vevs).</em></p>
<p><em> Anyway, the main reason I made the comment is that for the purposes of explaining to the public electroweak symmetry breaking, I think it makes sense to say that the Higgs boson mass comes from the Higgs field, because it is, in the SM, proportional to the vev.  It&#8217;s also kind of neat, I think.</em></p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>We disagree, that&#8217;s all there is to it.  What Garisto says about the Standard Model is a simple consequence of dimensional analysis, not a fundamental relation that applies widely. And no, it is not correct to say that the mass of a Higgs boson always goes to zero in the limit that all vevs go to zero; there can be first order phase transitions in which, as the parameters change, the Higgs field&#8217;s vev jumps from non-zero to zero abruptly, and the mass of the Higgs particle is never zero.  So I think to tell the public that the Higgs particle gets its mass from the Higgs field is to confuse them into thinking that the Higgs particle gets its mass the same way the other known particles do &#8212; which is false.</p>
<p>But in any case, we agree it&#8217;s not that big a deal.  The thing which is important for the public to understand is that the Higgs field does <strong>not</strong> give mass to <em><strong>all</strong></em> massive objects &#8212; such as atomic nuclei and black holes.  And the thing which it is important for particle physics students to understand is that the Higgs mass is not generically proportional to the vev of the Higgs field.</p>
