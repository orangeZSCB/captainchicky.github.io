										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>[Note Added: Thanks to some great comments I&#8217;ve received, I&#8217;m continuing to add clarifying remarks to this post.  You&#8217;ll find them in <span style="color:#008000;">green</span>.]</strong></em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a couple of months since the `photo&#8217; <em>(<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/04/09/a-non-experts-guide-to-a-black-holes-silhouette/">a false-color image created to show the intensity of radio waves, not visible light</a>) </em>of the black hole at the center of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_87">the galaxy M87</a>, taken by the <a href="https://eventhorizontelescope.org/">Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration</a>, was made public. Before it was shown, I wrote <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/04/09/a-non-experts-guide-to-a-black-holes-silhouette/">an introductory post</a> explaining what the &#8216;photo&#8217; is and isn&#8217;t. There I cautioned readers that I thought it might be difficult to interpret the image, and controversies about it might erupt.<img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="10375" data-permalink="https://profmattstrassler.com/technical-zone/test-page/ehtdiscoverym87-3/" data-orig-file="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/ehtdiscoverym87-1.png" data-orig-size="800,466" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="EHTDiscoveryM87" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/ehtdiscoverym87-1.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/ehtdiscoverym87-1.png?w=500" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10375" src="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/ehtdiscoverym87-1.png?w=300&#038;h=175" alt="EHTDiscoveryM87" width="300" height="175" srcset="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/ehtdiscoverym87-1.png?w=300&amp;h=175 300w, https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/ehtdiscoverym87-1.png?w=600&amp;h=350 600w, https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/ehtdiscoverym87-1.png?w=150&amp;h=87 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>So far, the claim that the image shows the vicinity of M87&#8217;s black hole (which I&#8217;ll call `M87bh&#8217; for short) has not been challenged, and I&#8217;m not expecting it to be. But what and where exactly is the material that is emitting the radio waves and thus creating the glow in the image? And what exactly determines the size of the dark region at the center of the image? These have been problematic issues from the beginning, but discussion is starting to heat up. <strong>And it&#8217;s important: it has implications for the measurement of the black hole&#8217;s mass</strong> (which <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ab1141">EHT claims is that of 6.5 billion Suns, with an uncertainty of about 15%</a>),<strong> and for any attempt to estimate its rotation rate.</strong><span id="more-10382"></span></p>
<p>Over the last few weeks I&#8217;ve spent some time studying the mathematics of spinning black holes, talking to my Harvard colleagues who are world&#8217;s experts on the relevant math and physics, and learning from colleagues who produced the `photo&#8217; and interpreted it. So I think I can now clearly explain what most journalists and scientist-writers (including me) got wrong at the time of the photo&#8217;s publication, and clarify what the photo does and doesn&#8217;t tell us.</p>
<p>One note before I begin: this post is long. But it starts with a summary of the situation that you can read quickly, and then comes the long part: a step-by-step non-technical explanation of an important aspect of the black hole &#8216;photo&#8217; that, to my knowledge, has not yet been given anywhere else.</p>
<p><em>[I am heavily indebted to Harvard postdocs Alex Lupsasca and Shahar Hadar for assisting me as I studied the formulas and concepts relevant for fast-spinning black holes. Much of what I learned comes from early 1970s papers, especially those by my former colleague Professor Jim Bardeen (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1972ApJ...178..347B/abstract">see this one written with Press and Teukolsky</a>), and from papers written in the last couple of years, especially <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.11112">this one</a> by my present and former Harvard colleagues.]</em></p>
<p><strong>What Does the EHT Image Show?</strong></p>
<p>Scientists understand the black hole itself &#8212; the geometric dimple in space and time &#8212; pretty well. If one knows the mass and the rotation rate of the black hole, and assumes Einstein&#8217;s equations for gravity are mostly correct <em>(for which we have considerable evidence, for example <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2016/06/15/ligo-detects-a-second-merger-of-black-holes/">from LIGO measurements</a> and elsewhere), </em>then the equations tell us what the black hole does to space and time and how its gravity works.</p>
<p>But for the `photo&#8217;, ​that&#8217;s not enough information. We don&#8217;t get to observe the black hole itself (it&#8217;s black, after all!) What the `photo&#8217; shows is a blurry ring of radio waves, emitted from hot material (a <a href="https://scied.ucar.edu/plasma">plasma</a> of mostly electrons and protons) <strong>somewhere around</strong> the black hole &#8212; material whose location, velocity, and temperature we do not know. That material and its emission of radio waves are influenced by powerful gravitational forces (whose details depend on the rotation rate of the M87bh, which we don&#8217;t know yet) and powerful magnetic fields (whose details we hardly know at all.) The black hole&#8217;s gravity then causes the paths on which the radio waves travel to bend, even more than a glass lens will bend the path of visible light, so that <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/04/09/a-non-experts-guide-to-a-black-holes-silhouette/">where things appear in the &#8216;photo&#8217; is not where they are actually located.</a></p>
<p>The only insights we have into this extreme environment come from computer simulations and a few other `photos&#8217; at lower magnification. The simulations are based on well-understood equations, but the equations have to be solved approximately, using methods that may or may not be justified. And the simulations don&#8217;t tell you where the matter <strong><em>is</em></strong>; they tell you where the material <em><strong>will go, </strong></em>but only <strong>after you make a guess</strong> as to where it is located at some initial point in time. <em>(In the same sense: computers can predict the national weather tomorrow only when you tell them what the national weather was yesterday.)</em> No one knows for sure how accurate or misleading these simulations might be; they&#8217;ve been tested against some indirect measurements, but no one can say for sure what flaws they might have.</p>
<p>However, there is one thing we can certainly say, and it has just been said publicly in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00873">a paper by Samuel Gralla, Daniel Holz and Robert Wald</a>.<em><br />
</em></p>
<p>Two months ago, when the EHT `photo&#8217; appeared, it was widely reported in the popular press and on blogs that the photo shows the image of a <strong>photon sphere</strong> at the edge of the <strong>shadow</strong> of the M87bh. <em>(Instead of `shadow&#8217;, I suggested the term &#8216;<strong>quasi-silhouette</strong>&#8216;, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/04/09/a-non-experts-guide-to-a-black-holes-silhouette/"> which I viewed as somewhat less misleading to a non-expert.</a>) </em></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">Unfortunately, it seems these statements are not true; and this was well-known to (but poorly communicated by, in my opinion) the EHT folks.  This lack of clarity might perhaps annoy some scientists and science-loving non-experts; but does this issue also matter scientifically? Gralla et al., in their new preprint, suggest that it does (though they were careful to not yet make a precise claim.)</span></p>
<p><strong>The Photon Sphere Doesn&#8217;t Exist</strong>&#8230;</p>
<p>Indeed, if you happened to be reading my posts carefully when the `photo&#8217; first appeared, you probably noticed that I was quite vague about the photon-sphere &#8212; I never defined precisely what it was. You would have been right to read this as a warning sign, for indeed I wasn&#8217;t getting clear explanations of it from anyone. Studying the equations and conversing with expert colleagues, I soon learned why: <em><strong>for a rotating black hole, the photon sphere doesn&#8217;t really exist.</strong></em></p>
<p>But let&#8217;s first define what the photon sphere is for a non-rotating black hole! Like the Earth&#8217;s equator, the photon sphere is a location, not an object. This location is the surface of an imaginary ball, lying well outside the black hole&#8217;s horizon. On the photon sphere, photons (the particles that make up light, radio waves, and all other electromagnetic waves) travel on special circular or spherical orbits around the black hole.</p>
<p>By contrast, a rotating black hole has a larger, broader `photon-zone&#8217; where photons can have special orbits. But you won&#8217;t ever see the whole photon zone in any image of a rotating black hole. Instead, a piece of the photon zone will appear as a `<em><strong>photon ring</strong></em>&#8216;, a bright and very thin loop of radio waves. However,<span style="color:#800080;"> the photon ring is <strong>not</strong> the edge of anything spherical, is generally <strong>not</strong> perfectly circular, and generally is <strong>not</strong> even perfectly centered on the black hole</span><em><span style="color:#800080;">.</span><br />
</em></p>
<p><strong>&#8230; and the Photon Ring Isn&#8217;t What We See&#8230;<br />
</strong></p>
<p>It seems likely that the M87bh is rotating quite rapidly, so it has a photon-zone rather than a photon-sphere, and images of it will have a photon ring. Ok, fine; but then, can we interpret EHT&#8217;s `photo&#8217; simply as showing the photon ring, blurred by the imperfections in the `telescope&#8217;? Although some of the EHT folks have seemed to suggest the answer is &#8220;yes&#8221;, Gralla et al. suggest the answer is likely &#8220;no&#8221; <em>(and many of their colleagues have been pointing out the same thing in private.)</em> <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em><strong>The circlet of radio waves that appears in the EHT `photo&#8217; is probably not simply a blurred image of M87bh&#8217;s photon ring; it probably shows a combination of the photon ring with something brighter </strong>(as explained below).</em></span> That&#8217;s where the controversy starts.</p>
<p><strong>&#8230;so the Dark Patch May Not Be the Full Shadow&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>The term `shadow&#8217; is confusing (which is why I prefer `quasi-silhouette&#8217; in describing it in public contexts, though that&#8217;s my own personal term) but no matter what you call it, in its ideal form it is supposed to be an absolutely dark area whose edge is the photon ring. But in reality the perfectly dark area need not appear so dark after all; it may be partly filled in by various effects. Furthermore, since the `photo&#8217; may not show us the photon ring, it&#8217;s far from clear that the dark patch in the center is the full shadow anyway. The EHT folks are well aware of this, but at the time the photo came out, many science writers and scientist-writers (including me) were not.</p>
<p><strong>&#8230;so EHT&#8217;s Measurement of the M87bh&#8217;s Mass is Being Questioned</strong></p>
<p>It was wonderful that EHT could make a picture that could travel round the internet at the speed of light, and generate justifiable excitement and awe that human beings could indirectly observe such an amazing thing as a black hole with a mass of several billion Sun-like stars. Qualitatively, they achieved something fantastic in showing that yes, the object at the center of M87 really is as compact and dark as such a black hole would be expected to be! But the EHT telescope&#8217;s main <strong><em>quantitative</em></strong> achievement was <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ab1141">a measurement of the mass of the M87bh</a>, with a claimed precision of about 15%.</p>
<p>Naively, one could imagine that the mass is measured by looking at the diameter of the dark spot in the black hole &#8216;photo&#8217;, under the assumption that it is the black hole&#8217;s shadow. So here&#8217;s the issue: <em><strong>Could interpreting the dark region incorrectly perhaps lead to a significant mistake in the mass measurement, and/or an underestimate of how uncertain the mass measurement actually is?</strong></em></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know.  The EHT folks are certainly aware of these issues; their simulations show them explicitly.  The mass of the M87bh isn&#8217;t literally measured by putting a ruler on the &#8216;photo&#8217; and measuring the size of the dark spot! The actual methods are much more sophisticated than that, and I don&#8217;t understand them well enough yet to explain, evaluate or criticize them. All I can say with confidence right now is that these are important questions that experts currently are debating, and consensus on the answer may not be achieved for quite a while.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p><strong>The Appearance of a Black Hole With Nearby Matter</strong></p>
<p>Ok, now I&#8217;m going to explain the most relevant points, step-by-step. Grab a cup of coffee or tea, find a comfy chair, and bear with me.</p>
<p>Because fast-rotating black holes are more complicated, I&#8217;m going to start illuminating the controversy by looking at a <strong>non-rotating</strong> black hole&#8217;s properties, which is also what Gralla et al. mainly do in their paper. It turns out the qualitative conclusion drawn from the non-rotating case largely applies in the rotating case too, at least in the case of the M87bh as seen from our perspective; that&#8217;s important because the M87bh may well be rotating at a very good clip.</p>
<p>A little terminology first: for a rotating black hole there&#8217;s a natural definition of the poles and the equator, just as there is for the Earth: there&#8217;s an axis of rotation, and the poles are where that axis intersects with the black hole horizon. The equator is the circle that lies halfway between the poles. For a non-rotating black hole, there&#8217;s no such axis and no such automatic definition, but it will be useful to define the north pole of the black hole to be the point on the horizon closest to us.</p>
<p><strong>A Single Source of Electromagnetic Waves</strong></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s imagine placing a bright light bulb on the same plane as the equator, outside the black hole horizon but rather close to it. <em>(The bulb could emit radio waves or visible light or any other form of electromagnetic waves, at any frequency; for what I&#8217;m about to say, it doesn&#8217;t matter at all, so I&#8217;ll just call it `light&#8217;.)</em> See Figure 1. Where will the light from the bulb go?</p>
<p>Some of it, heading inward, ends up in the black hole, while some of it heads outward toward distant observers. The gravity of the black hole will bend the path of the light. And here&#8217;s something remarkable: a small fraction of the light, aimed just so, can actually spiral around the black hole any number of times before heading out. As a result, you will see the bulb not once but multiple times!</p>
<p>There will be a direct image &#8212; light that comes directly to us &#8212; from near the bulb&#8217;s true location (displaced because gravity bends the light a bit, just as a glass lens will distort the appearance of what&#8217;s behind it.) That path of that light is the orange arrow in Figure 1. But then there will be an <strong>indirect</strong> image (the green arrow in Figure 1) from light that goes halfway around the black hole before heading in our direction; we will see that image of the bulb on the opposite side of the black hole. Let&#8217;s call that the `first indirect image.&#8217; Then there will be a second indirect image from light that orbits the black hole once and comes out near the direct image, but further out; that&#8217;s the blue arrow in Figure 1. Then there will be a third indirect image from light that goes around one and a half times (not shown), and so on. In short, Figure 1 shows the paths of the direct, first indirect, and second indirect images of the bulb as they head toward our location at the top of the image.</p>

For light to make orbits of the black hole, it must travel near the grey-dashed circle that indicates the location of a &#8220;photon-sphere.&#8221; (A rotating black hole has no such sphere, but when seen from the north or south pole, the light observed takes similar paths to what is shown in this figure.) <em>[The paths of the light rays were calculated carefully using Mathematica 11.3.]</em></p></div>What you can see in Figure 1 is that both the first and second indirect images are formed by light that spends part of its time close to a special radius around the back hole, shown as a dotted line. This imaginary surface, the edge of a ball,  is an honest &#8220;photon-sphere&#8221; in the case of a <strong><em>non-rotating</em></strong> black hole.</p>
<p>In the case of a <strong><em>rotating</em></strong> black hole, something very similar happens <strong>when you&#8217;re looking at the black hole from its north (or south) pole</strong>; there&#8217;s a special circle then too. But that circle is <em><strong>not</strong></em> the edge of a photon-sphere! In general, photons can have special orbits in a wide region, which I called the &#8220;photon-zone&#8221; earlier, and only a small set of them are on this circle. You&#8217;ll see photons from other parts of the photon zone if you look at the black hole not from the poles but from some other angle.</p>
<p><em>[If you&#8217;d like to learn a bit more about the photon zone, and you have a little bit of knowledge of black holes already, you can profit from exploring this demo by Professor Leo Stein: <a href="https://duetosymmetry.com/tool/kerr-circular-photon-orbits/">https://duetosymmetry.com/tool/kerr-circular-photon-orbits/</a> ]</em></p>
<p>Back to the non-rotating case: What our camera will see, looking at what is emitted from the light bulb, is shown in Figure 2: an infinite number of increasingly squished `indirect&#8217; images, half on one side of the black hole near the direct image, and the other half on the other side. What is not obvious, but true, is that only the first of the indirect images is large and bright; this is one of Gralla <em>et al.</em>&#8216;s main points. We can, therefore, separate the images into the direct image, the first indirect image, and the remaining indirect images. The total amount of light coming from the direct image and the first indirect image can be large, but the total amount of light from the remaining indirect images is typically (according to Gralla <em>et al.</em>) less than 5% of the light from the first indirect image. And so, unless we have an extremely high-powered camera, we&#8217;ll never pick those other images up. <strong>Let&#8217;s therefore focus our attention on the direct image and the first indirect image.</strong></p>

<p><strong>A Circular Source of Electromagnetic Waves</strong></p>
<p>Proceeding step by step toward a more realistic situation, let&#8217;s replace our ordinary bulb by a circular bulb (Figure 3), again set somewhat close to the horizon, sitting in the plane that contains the equator. What would we see now?</p>

<p>That&#8217;s shown in Figure 4: the direct image is a circle (looking somewhat larger than it really is); outside it sits the first indirect image of the ring; and then come all the other indirect images, looking quite dim and all piling up at one radius.

<p>Importantly, if we consider circular bulbs of different diameter [yellow, red and blue in Figure 5], then although the direct images reflect the differences in the bulbs&#8217; diameters (somewhat enlarged by lensing), the first indirect images <strong>all are about the same diameter</strong>, just a tad larger or smaller than the photon ring.  The remaining indirect images all sit together at the radius of the photon ring.</p>

<p>These statements are also essentially true for a rotating black hole seen from the north or south pole; a circular bulb generates a series of circular images, and the indirect images all pile more or less on top of each other, forming a photon ring. When viewed off the poles, the rotating black hole becomes a more complicated story, but as long as the viewing angle is small enough, the changes are relatively minor and the picture is qualitatively somewhat similar.</p>
<p><strong>A Disk as a Source of Electromagnetic Waves</strong></p>
<p>And what if you replaced the circular bulb with a disk-shaped bulb, a sort of glowing pancake with a circular hole at its center, as in Figure 7? That&#8217;s relevant because black holes are thought to have `accretion disks&#8217; made of material orbiting the black hole, and eventually spiraling in. The accretion disk may well be the dominant source emitting radio waves at the M87bh. <em>(I&#8217;m showing a very thin uniform disk for illustration, but a real accretion disk is not uniform, changes rapidly as clumps of material move within it and then spiral into the black hole, and may be quite thick &#8212; as thick as the black hole is wide, or even thicker.)</em></p>
<p>Well, we can think of the disk as many concentric circles of light placed together. The direct images of the disk (shown in Figure 6 left, on one side of the disk, as an orange wash) would form a disk in your camera, the dim red region in Figure 6 right; the hole at its center would appear larger than it really is due to the bending caused by the black hole&#8217;s gravity, but the shape would be similar. However, the indirect images would all pile up in almost the same place from your perspective, forming a bright and quite thin ring, the bright yellow circle in Figure 6 right. (The path of the disk&#8217;s first indirect image is shown in Figure 6 left, going halfway about the black hole as a green wash; notice how it narrows as it travels, which is why it appears as a narrow ring in the image at right.) This circle &#8212; the full set of indirect images of the whole disk &#8212; is the edge of the photon-sphere for a non-rotating black hole, and the circular photon ring for a rotating black hole viewed from its north or south pole.</p>

The direct image of the disk forms a disk (illustrated at left, for a piece of the disk, as an orange wash) while the first indirect image becomes highly compressed (illustrated, for a piece of the disk, as a green wash) and is seen as a narrow circle of bright light.  <em><span style="color:#008000;">(It is expected that the disk is mostly transparent in radio waves, so the indirect image can pass through it.)</span></em> That circle, along with the other indirect images, forms the photon ring. In this case, because the disk&#8217;s inner edge lies close to the black hole horizon, the photon ring sits within the disk&#8217;s direct image, but we&#8217;ll see a different example in Figure 9.</p></div>
<p><span style="color:#808080;"><em>[Gralla et al. call the first indirect image the `lensed ring&#8217; and the remaining indirect images, currently unobservable at EHT, the `photon ring&#8217;, while EHT refers to <strong>all</strong> the indirect images as the `photon ring&#8217;. Just letting you know in case you hear `lensed ring&#8217; referred to in future.]</em></span></p>
<p>So the conclusion is that if we had a perfect camera, the direct image of a disk makes a disk, but the indirect images (mainly just the first one, as Gralla et al. emphasize) make a bright, thin ring that may be superposed upon the direct image of the disk, depending on the disk&#8217;s shape.</p>
<p>And this conclusion, with some important adjustments, applies also for a spinning black hole viewed from above its north or south pole &#8212; i.e., along its axis of rotation &#8212; or from near that axis; I&#8217;ll mention the adjustments in a moment.</p>
<p>But EHT is not a perfect camera. To make the black hole image, technology had to be pushed to its absolute limits. Someday we&#8217;ll see both the disk and the ring, but right now, they&#8217;re all blurred together. So which one is more important?</p>
<p><strong>From a Blurry Image to Blurry Knowledge</strong></p>
<p>What does a blurry camera do to this simple image? You might think that the disk is so dim and the ring so bright that the camera will mainly show you a blurry image of the bright photon ring. But that&#8217;s wrong. The ring isn&#8217;t bright enough. A simple calculation reveals that the ​photo will show mainly the disk, not the photon ring! This is shown in Figure 9, which you can compare with the Black Hole `photo&#8217; (Figure 10). <em>(Figure 9 is symmetric around the ring, but the photo is not, for multiple reasons &#8212; Doppler-like effect from rotation, viewpoint off the rotation axis, etc. &#8212; which I&#8217;ll have to defer til another post.)</em></p>
<p>More precisely, <em><strong>the ring and disk blur together, but the brightness of the image is dominated by the disk, not the ring.<br />
</strong></em></p>

<p>Let&#8217;s say that again: the black hole `photo&#8217; may mainly show the M87bh&#8217;s accretion disk, with the photon ring contributing only some of the light, <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em><strong>and therefore the photon ring does not completely and unambiguously determine the radius of the observed dark patch in the `photo​.&#8217; <span style="color:#800000;"><span style="color:#000000;">In general, the patch</span> <span style="color:#ff0000;">could be considerably smaller</span> <span style="color:#000000;">than what is usually termed the `shadow&#8217; of the black hole.</span></span><br />

Its accretion disk has an unknown size and shape — it may be quite thick and non-uniform — and it may not even lie at the black hole’s equator. The disk and the black hole interact to create outward-going jets of material (observed already many years ago but not clearly visible in the EHT ‘photo’.) (Right) The EHT `photo’ of the M87bh (taken in radio waves and shown in false color!) Compare with Figure 7; the most important difference is that one side of the image is brighter than the other. This likely arises from (a) our view being slightly off from the south pole, combined with (b) rotation of the black hole and its disk, and (c) possibly other more subtle issues.</p></div>
<p>This is important. The photon ring&#8217;s diameter, and thus the width of the `shadow&#8217; too, barely depend on the rotation rate of the black hole; they depend almost exclusively on the black hole&#8217;s mass. So <em><strong>if the ring in the photo were simply the photon ring of the M87bh, you&#8217;d have a very simple way to measure the black hole&#8217;s mass without knowing its rotation rate</strong></em>: you&#8217;d look at how large the dark patch is, or equivalently, the diameter of the blurry ring, and that would give you the answer to within 10%. But it&#8217;s nowhere near so simple if the blurry ring shows the accretion disk, because the accretion disk&#8217;s properties and appearance can vary much more than the photon ring; they can depend strongly on the black hole&#8217;s rotation rate, and also on magnetic fields and other details of the black hole&#8217;s vicinity.</p>
<p><strong>The Important Role of Rotation</strong></p>
<p>If we conclude that EHT is seeing a mix of the accretion disk with the photon ring, with the former dominating the brightness, then this makes EHT&#8217;s measurement of the M87bh&#8217;s mass more confusing and even potentially suspect. Hence: controversy. Is it possible that EHT underestimated their uncertainties, and that their measurement of the black hole mass has more ambiguities, and is not as precise, as they currently claim?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s where the rotation rate is important. <span style="color:#008000;">Despite what I showed (for pedagogical simplicity) in Figure 7</span>, for a non-rotating black hole the accretion disk&#8217;s central gap is <span style="color:#008000;">actually</span> expected to lie <strong>outside</strong> the photon ring; this is shown at the top of Figure 9.  But  the faster the black hole rotates, the smaller this central gap is expected to be, to the point that for a fast-rotating black hole the gap will lie <strong>inside</strong> the photon ring, <span style="color:#008000;">as shown at the bottom of Figure 9.</span> <em>(This tendency is not obvious; it requires understanding details of the black hole geometry.)</em> And if that is true, the dark patch in the EHT image may not be the black hole&#8217;s full shadow (i.e. quasi-silhouette), which is the region inside the photon ring. <strong>It may be just the inner portion of it, with the outer portion obscured by emission from the accretion disk.</strong></p>
<p>The <span style="color:#008000;">effect of blurring in the</span> two cases of slow (or zero) and fast rotation are illustrated in Figure 9, where the photon ring&#8217;s size is taken to be the same in each case but the disk&#8217;s inner edge is close in or far out. (The black holes, not illustrated since they aren&#8217;t visible anyway, differ in mass by about 10% in order to have the photon ring the same size.) This shows why the size of the dark patch can be quite different, depending on the disk&#8217;s shape, even when the photon ring&#8217;s size is the same.</p>

(Left) the view in a perfect camera; (right) rough illustration of the effect of blurring in the current version of the EHT. The faster the black hole is spinning, the smaller the central gap in the accretion disk is likely to be. No matter what the extent of the accretion disk (dark red), the photon ring (yellow) remains at roughly the same location, changing only by 10% between a non-rotating black hole and a maximally rotating black hole of the same mass. But blurring in the camera combines the disk and photon ring into a thick ring whose brightness is dominated by the disk rather than the ring, and which can therefore be of different size even though the mass is the same. This implies that the radius of the blurry ring in the EHT `photo’, and the size of the dark region inside it, cannot by themselves tell us the black hole’s mass; at a minimum we must also know the rotation rate (which we do not.)</p></div>
<p>Gralla et al. subtly raise these questions but are careful not to overstate their case, perhaps because they have not yet completed their study of rotating black holes. But the question is now in the air.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m interested to hear what the EHT folks have to say about it, as I&#8217;m sure they have detailed arguments in favor of their procedures. In particular, <strong>EHT&#8217;s simulations show all of the effects mentioned above; there&#8217;s none of this of which they are unaware.</strong> (In fact, the reason I know my illustrations above are reasonable is partly because you can see similar pictures <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ab0f43">in the EHT papers.</a>) As long as the EHT folks correctly accounted for all the issues, then they should have been able to properly measure the mass and estimate their uncertainties correctly. <strong><em>In fact, they don&#8217;t really use the photo itself; they use more subtle techniques applied to their telescope data directly. </em></strong>Thus it&#8217;s not enough to argue the photo itself is ambiguous; one has to argue that EHT&#8217;s more subtle analysis methods are flawed. No one has argued that yet, as far as I am aware.</p>
<p>But the one thing that&#8217;s clear right now is that science writers almost uniformly got it wrong <em>[because the experts didn&#8217;t explain these points well]</em> when they tried to describe the image two months ago. The `photo&#8217; probably does not show &#8220;a photon ring surrounding a shadow.&#8221; That would be nice and simple and impressive-sounding, since it refers to fundamental properties of the black hole&#8217;s warping effects on space. But it&#8217;s far too glib, as Figures 7 and 9 show. We&#8217;re probably seeing an accretion disk supplemented by a photon ring, all blurred together, and the dark region may well be smaller than the black hole&#8217;s shadow.</p>
<p><em>(Rather than, or in addition to, the accretion disk, it is also possible that the dominant emission in the photo comes from the inner portion of one of the jets that emerges from the vicinity of the black hole; see Figure 8 above. This is another detail that makes the situation more difficult to interpret, but doesn&#8217;t change the main point I&#8217;m making.)</em></p>
<p>Someday in the not distant future, improved imaging should allow EHT to separately image the photon ring and the disk, so both can be observed easily, as in the left side of Figure 9. Then all these questions will be answered definitively.</p>
<p><strong>Why the Gargantua Black Hole from <em>Interstellar</em> is Completely Different</strong></p>
<p>Just as a quick aside, what would you see if an accretion disk were edge-on rather than face-on? Then, in a perfect camera, you&#8217;d see something like the famous picture of Gargantua, the black hole from the movie <em>Interstellar</em> &#8212; a direct image of the front edge of the disk, and a strongly lensed indirect image of the back side of the disk, appearing both above and below the black hole, as illustrated in Figure 11. And that leads to the Gargantua image from the movie, also shown in Figure 11. Notice the photon ring (which is, as I cautioned you earlier, off-center!)   <em><span style="color:#339966;">[Note added: this figure has been modified; in the original version I referred to the top and bottom views of the disk&#8217;s far side as the  &#8220;1st indirect image&#8221;, but as pointed out by Professor Jean-Pierre Luminet, that&#8217;s not correct terminology here.]</span> </em></p>

As a result, the direct image of the disk cuts across the black hole, and indirect images of the back side of the disk are seen above and below the black hole. There is also a bright photon ring, slightly off center; this is well outside the surface of the black hole, which is not visible. A real image would not be symmetric left-to-right; it would be brighter on the side that is rotating toward the viewer.  <span style="color:#339966;">At the bottom is shown a much more realistic visual image (albeit not so good quality) from 1994 by Jean-Alain Marck, in which this asymmetry can be seen clearly.</span></p></div>
<p>However, the movie image leaves out an important Doppler-like effect (which I&#8217;ll explain someday when I understand it 100%). This makes the part of the disk that is rotating toward us bright, and the part rotating away from us dim&#8230; and so a real image from this vantage point would be very asymmetric &#8212; bright on the left, dim on the right &#8212; unlike the movie image. <span style="color:#339966;"> At the suggestion of Professsor Jean-Pierre Luminet I have added, at the bottom of Figure 10, a very early simulation by Jean-Alain Marck that shows this effect.</span></p>
<p>I mention this because a number of expert science journalists incorrectly explained the M87 image by referring to Gargantua &#8212; but that image has essentially <em><strong>nothing</strong></em> to do with the recent black hole `photo&#8217;. M87&#8217;s accretion disk is certainly not edge-on. The movie&#8217;s Gargantua image is taken from the equator, not from near the pole.</p>
<p><strong>Final Remarks: Where a Rotating Black Hole Differs from a Non-Rotating One<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Before I quit for the week, I&#8217;ll just summarize a few big differences for fast-rotating black holes compared to non-rotating ones.</p>
<p>1) As I&#8217;ve just emphasized, what a rotating black hole looks like to a distant observer depends not only on where the matter around the black hole is located but also on how the black hole&#8217;s rotation axis is oriented relative to the observer. A pole observer, an equatorial observer, and a near-pole observer see quite different things. (As noted in Figure 8, we are apparently near-south-pole observers for M87&#8217;s black hole.)</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s assume that the accretion disk lies in the same plane as the black hole&#8217;s equator &#8212; there are some reasons to expect this. Even then, the story is complex.</p>
<p>2) As I mentioned above, instead of a photon-sphere, there is a &#8216;photon-zone&#8217; &#8212; a region where specially aimed photons can travel round the black hole multiple times. For high-enough spin (greater than about 80% of maximum as I recall), an accretion disk&#8217;s inner edge can lie within the photon zone, or even closer to the black hole than the photon zone; and this can cause a filling-in of the &#8216;shadow&#8217;.</p>
<p>3) Depending on the viewing angle, the indirect images of the disk that form the photon ring may not be a circle, and may not be concentric with the direct image of the disk. Only when viewed from along the rotation axis (i.e., above the north or south pole) will the direct and indirect images of the disk all be circular and concentric. We&#8217;re not viewing the M87bh on its axis, and that further complicates interpretation of the blurry image.</p>
<p>4) When the viewing angle is not along the rotation axis the image will be asymmetric, brighter on one side than the other. (This is true of EHT&#8217;s `photo&#8217;.) However, I know of at least four potential causes of this asymmetry, any or all of which might play a role, and the degree of asymmetry depends on properties of the accretion disk and the rotation rate of the black hole, both of which are currently unknown. Claims about the asymmetry made by the EHT folks seem, at least to me, to be based on certain assumptions that I, at least, cannot currently check.</p>
<p>Each of these complexities is a challenge to explain, so I&#8217;ll give both you and I a substantial break while I figure out how best to convey what is known (at least to me) about these issues.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">THIS POST CONTAINS ERRORS CONCERNING THE EXISTENCE AND VISIBILITY OF THE SO-CALLED PHOTON-SPHERE AND SHADOW; THESE ERRORS WERE COMMON TO ESSENTIALLY ALL REPORTING ON THE BLACK HOLE &#8216;PHOTO&#8217;.  IT HAS BEEN SUPERSEDED BY <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/06/14/a-ring-of-controversy-around-a-black-hole-photo">THIS POST</a>, WHICH CORRECTS THESE ERRORS AND EXPLAINS THE SITUATION.</span></strong></p>
<p>Ok, after <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/04/15/the-black-hole-photo-what-are-we-looking-at/">yesterday&#8217;s post, in which I told you what I still didn&#8217;t understand about the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) black hole image</a> (see also <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/04/09/a-non-experts-guide-to-a-black-holes-silhouette/">the pre-photo blog post</a> in which I explained pedagogically what the image was likely to show and why), today I can tell you that quite a few of the gaps in my understanding are filling in <em>(thanks mainly to conversations with Harvard postdoc Alex Lupsasca and science journalist Davide Castelvecchi, and to direct answers from professor Heino Falcke, who leads the Event Horizon Telescope Science Council and co-wrote <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/312423/fulltext/">a founding paper in this subject</a>)</em>.  And I can give you an update to yesterday&#8217;s very tentative figure.</p>
<p>First: a very important point, to which I will return in a future post, is that as I suspected, <strong><em>it&#8217;s not at all clear what the EHT image really shows.</em></strong>   More precisely, assuming Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity is correct in this context:</p>
<ul>
<li>The image itself <del>clearly shows a black hole&#8217;s quasi-silhouette (called a `shadow&#8217; in expert jargon) and its bright photon-sphere</del> where photons [particles of light &#8212; of all electromagnetic waves, including radio waves] can be gathered and focused.</li>
<li>However, all the light (including the observed radio waves) coming from the photon-sphere was emitted from material <del><em><strong>well outside</strong></em> the photon-sphere</del>; and <strong>the image itself does not tell you where that material is located.</strong>  <em>(To quote Falcke: this is `a blessing and a curse&#8217;; insensitivity to the illumination source makes it <del>easy to interpret the black hole&#8217;s role in the image</del> but hard to learn much about the material near the black hole.)</em> It&#8217;s a bit analogous to seeing a brightly shining metal ball while not being able to see what it&#8217;s being lit by&#8230; except that the photon-sphere isn&#8217;t an object.  It&#8217;s just a result of the play of the light [well, radio waves] directed by the bending effects of gravity.  More on that in a future post.</li>
<li>When you see a picture of an accretion disk and jets drawn to illustrate where the radio waves may come from, <strong><em>keep in mind that it involves additional assumptions</em></strong> &#8212; educated assumptions that combine many other measurements of M87&#8217;s black hole with simulations of matter, gravity and magnetic fields interacting near a black hole.  But we should be cautious: perhaps not all the assumptions are right.  The image shows no conflicts with those assumptions, but neither does it confirm them on its own.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just to indicate the importance of these assumptions, let me highlight a remark made at the press conference that the black hole is rotating quickly, clockwise from our perspective.  But (as the EHT papers state) <strong><em>if one doesn&#8217;t make some of the above-mentioned assumptions, one cannot conclude from the image alone that the black hole is actually rotating.</em></strong>  The interplay of these assumptions is something I&#8217;m still trying to get straight.</p>
<p>Second, if you buy all the assumptions, then the picture I drew in yesterday&#8217;s post is mostly correct except (a) the jets are far too narrow, and shown overly disconnected from the disk, and (b) they are slightly mis-oriented relative to the orientation of the image.  Below is an improved version of this picture, probably still not the final one.  The new features: the jets (now pointing in the right directions relative to the photo) are fatter and not entirely disconnected from the accretion disk.  This is important because the dominant source of illumination of the photon-sphere might come from the region where the disk and jets meet.</p>

It consists of a fat but tenuous accretion disk of material, almost face-on, some of which is funneled into jets, one heading almost toward us, the other in the opposite direction.  The material surrounds but is somewhat separated from a rotating black hole&#8217;s event horizon.  At this radio frequency, the jets <del>and disk</del> are too dim in radio waves to see in the image; <del>only at (and perhaps close to) the photon-sphere</del>, where some of the radio waves are collected and focused, are they bright enough to be easily discerned by the Event Horizon Telescope.</p></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The short answer: I&#8217;m really not sure yet. <del> <span style="color:#339966;">[This post is now largely superseded by the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/04/16/the-black-hole-photo-seeing-more-clearly/">next one</a>, in which some of the questions raised below have now been answered.]</span></del>  <span style="color:#ff0000;">EVEN THAT POST WAS WRONG ABOUT THE PHOTON-SPHERE AND SHADOW.  SEE <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/06/14/a-ring-of-controversy-around-a-black-hole-photo">THIS POST</a> FROM JUNE 2019 FOR SOME ESSENTIAL CORRECTIONS THAT WERE LEFT OUT OF ALL REPORTING ON THIS SUBJECT.</span></p>
<p>Neither are some of my colleagues who know more about the black hole geometry than I do. And at this point we still haven&#8217;t figured out what the Event Horizon Telescope experts do and don&#8217;t know about this question&#8230; or whether they agree amongst themselves.</p>
<p><em>[Note added: last week, a number of people pointed me to a very nice video by Veritasium illustrating some of the features of black holes, accretion disks and the warping of their appearance by the gravity of the black hole.  <strong>However, Veritasium&#8217;s video illustrates a non-rotating black hole with a thin accretion disk that is edge-on from our perspective; and <span style="color:#ff0000;">this is definitely NOT what we are seeing!</span></strong>]</em></p>
<p>As I emphasized in my <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/04/09/a-non-experts-guide-to-a-black-holes-silhouette/">pre-photo blog post</a> (in which I described carefully what we were likely to be shown, and the subtleties involved), <em><strong>this is not a simple photograph of what&#8217;s `actually there.&#8217;</strong></em> We all agree that what we&#8217;re looking at is light from some glowing material around the solar-system-sized black hole at the heart of the galaxy M87.  But that light has been wildly bent on its path toward Earth, and so &#8212; just like a room seen through an old, warped window, and a dirty one at that &#8212; it&#8217;s not simple to interpret what we&#8217;re actually seeing. Where, exactly, is the material `in truth&#8217;, such that its light appears where it does in the image? Interpretation of the image is potentially ambiguous, and certainly not obvious.<span id="more-10268"></span></p>
<p>The naive guess as to what to <em><strong>expect</strong></em> &#8212; which astronomers developed over many years, based on many studies of many suspected black holes &#8212; is crudely illustrated in the figure at the end of this post.  Material around a black hole has two main components:</p>
<ul>
<li>An accretion disk of `gas&#8217; (really <em>plasma</em>, i.e. a very hot collection of electrons, protons, and other atomic nuclei) which may be thin and concentrated, or thick and puffy, or something more complicated.  The disk extends inward to within a few times the radius of the black hole&#8217;s event horizon, the point of no-return; but how close it can be depends on how fast the black hole rotates.</li>
<li>Two oppositely-directed jets of material, created somehow by material from the disk being concentrated and accelerated by magnetic fields tied up with the black hole and its accretion disk; the jets begin not far from the event horizon, but then extend outward all the way to the outer edges of the entire galaxy.</li>
</ul>
<p>But even if this is true, it&#8217;s not at all obvious (at least to me) what these objects look like in an image such as we saw Wednesday. As far as I am currently aware, their appearance in the image depends on</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether the disk is thick and puffy, or thin and concentrated;</li>
<li>How far the disk extends inward and outward around the black hole;</li>
<li>The process by which the jets are formed and where exactly they originate;</li>
<li>How fast the black hole is spinning;</li>
<li>The orientation of the axis around which the black hole is spinning;</li>
<li>The typical frequencies of the radio waves emitted by the disk and by the jets (compared to the frequency, about 230 Gigahertz, observed by the Event Horizon Telescope);</li>
</ul>
<p>and perhaps other things. I can&#8217;t yet figure out what we do and don&#8217;t know about these things; and it doesn&#8217;t help that some of the statements made by the EHT scientists in public and in their six papers seem contradictory (and I can&#8217;t yet say whether that&#8217;s because of typos, misstatements by them, or [most likely] misinterpretations by me.)</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s the best I can do right now, for myself and for you. Below is a figure that is <em><strong>nothing but an illustration of my best attempt so far to make sense of what we are seeing</strong></em>. <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong><del>You can expect that some fraction of this figure is wrong</del>.</strong></span> <span style="color:#ff0000;">Increasingly I believe this figure is correct in cartoon form, though the picture on the left is too sketchy right now and needs improvement.</span>  <em>[NOTE ADDED: AS EXPLAINED IN <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/06/14/a-ring-of-controversy-around-a-black-hole-photo">THIS MORE RECENT POST</a>, THE &#8220;PHOTON-SPHERE&#8221; DOES NOT EXIST FOR A ROTATING BLACK HOLE; THE &#8220;PHOTON-RING&#8221; OF LIGHT THAT SURROUNDS THE SHADOW DOES NOT DOMINATE WHAT IS ACTUALLY SEEN IN THE IMAGE; AND THE DARK PATCH IN THE IMAGE ISN&#8217;T NECESSARILY THE ENTIRE SHADOW.]</em>  What I&#8217;ll be doing this week is fixing my own misconceptions and trying to become clear on what the experts do and don&#8217;t know. <em>Experts are more than welcome to set me straight!</em></p>
<p>In short &#8212; this story is not over, at least not for me. As I gain a clearer understanding of what we do and don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;ll write more about it.</p>

Left: the standard guess concerning the immediate vicinity of M87&#8217;s black hole: an accretion disk oriented nearly face-on from Earth&#8217;s perspective, jets aimed nearly at and away from us, and a rotating black hole at the center.  The orientation of the jets may not be correct relative to the photo.  Upper right: The image after the radio waves&#8217; paths are bent by gravity.  The quasi-silhouette of the black hole is larger than the `true&#8217; event horizon, a lot of radio waves are concentrated at the &#8216;photon-sphere&#8217; just outside (brighter at the bottom due to the black-hole spinning clockwise around an axis slightly askew to our line of sight); some additional radio waves from the accretion disk and jets further complicate the image. Most of the <del>disk</del> and jets are too dim to see.  Lower Right: This image is then blurred out by the Event Horizon Telescope&#8217;s limitations, partly compensated for by heavy-duty image processing.</p></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>[Note added April 16: some minor improvements have been made to this article as my understanding has increased, specifically concerning the photon-sphere, which is the main region from which the radio waves are seen in the recently released image. See later blog posts for the image and its interpretation.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Note added June 14: significant misconceptions concerning the photon-sphere and shadow, as relevant to the black hole &#8216;photo&#8217;, dominated reporting in April, and I myself was also subject to them.  <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/06/14/a-ring-of-controversy-around-a-black-hole-photo">I have explained the origin of and correction to these misconceptions, which affect the interpretation of the image, in my post &#8220;A Ring of Controversy&#8221;.</a>]</em></p>
<p>About fifteen years ago, when I was a professor at the University of Washington, the particle physics theorists and the astronomer theorists occasionally would arrange to have lunch together, to facilitate an informal exchange of information about our adjacent fields. Among the many enjoyable discussions, one I was particularly excited about &#8212; as much as an amateur as a professional &#8212; was that in which I learned of the plan to make some sort of image of a black hole. I was told that this incredible feat would likely be achieved by 2020. <a href="https://eventhorizontelescope.org/blog/media-advisory-first-results-event-horizon-telescope-be-presented-april-10th">The time, it seems, has arrived.</a></p>
<p>The goal of this post is to provide readers with what I hope will be a helpful guide through the foggy swamp that is likely to partly obscure this major scientific result. Over the last days I&#8217;ve been reading what both scientists and science journalists are writing in advance of the press conference Wednesday morning, and I&#8217;m finding many examples of jargon masquerading as English, terms poorly defined, and phrasing that seems likely to mislead. As I&#8217;m increasingly concerned that many non-experts will be unable to understand what is presented tomorrow, and what the pictures do and do not mean, I&#8217;m using this post to answer a few questions that many readers (and many of these writers) have perhaps not thought to ask.<span id="more-10241"></span></p>
<p>A caution: I am not an expert on this subject. At the moment, I&#8217;m still learning about the more subtle issues. I&#8217;ll try to be clear about when I&#8217;m on the edge of my knowledge, and hopefully won&#8217;t make any blunders <em>[but experts, please point them out if you see any!]</em></p>
<p><strong>Which black holes are being imaged?</strong></p>
<p>The initial plan behind the so-called &#8220;Event Horizon Telescope&#8221; <em>(the name deserves some discussion; see below)</em> has been to make images of two black holes at the centers of galaxies (the star-cities in which most stars are found.) These are not black holes formed by the collapse of individual stars, such as the ones whose collisions have been <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2016/02/11/advance-thoughts-on-ligo/">observed through their gravitational waves</a>. <em><strong>Central galactic black holes are millions or even billions of times larger!</strong></em>  The ones being observed are</p>
<ol>
<li>the large and `close&#8217; black hole at the center of the Milky Way (the giant star-city we call home), and</li>
<li>the immense but much more distant back hole at the center of M87 (a spectacularly big star-megalopolis.)</li>
</ol>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_10244" style="width: 751px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10244" data-attachment-id="10244" data-permalink="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/04/09/a-non-experts-guide-to-a-black-holes-silhouette/milkywayandm87/" data-orig-file="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/milkywayandm87.jpg" data-orig-size="741,280" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS 6D&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1439682646&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;10000&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;30&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="MilkyWayAndM87" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/milkywayandm87.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/milkywayandm87.jpg?w=500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10244" src="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/milkywayandm87.jpg?w=500" alt="MilkyWayAndM87.jpg" srcset="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/milkywayandm87.jpg?w=500 500w, https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/milkywayandm87.jpg?w=150 150w, https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/milkywayandm87.jpg?w=300 300w, https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/milkywayandm87.jpg 741w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"   /><p id="caption-attachment-10244" class="wp-caption-text">Left: the Milky Way as seen in the night sky; we see our galaxy from within, and so cannot see its spiral shape directly.  The brightest region is toward the center of the galaxy, and deep within it is the black hole of interest, as big as a large star but incredibly small in this image.  Right: the enormous elliptically-shaped galaxy M87, which sports an enormous black hole (but again, incredibly small in this image) at its center.  The blue stripe is a jet of material hurled at near-light-speed from the region very close to the black hole.</p></div>
<p>Why go after both of these black holes at the same time? Just as the Sun and Moon appear the same size in our sky because of an accident &#8212; the Sun&#8217;s greater distance is almost precisely compensated by its greater size &#8212; these two black holes appear similarly sized, albeit very tiny, from our vantage point.</p>
<p>Our galaxy&#8217;s central black hole has a mass of about four million Suns, and its size is about twenty times wider than our Sun (in contrast to the black holes whose gravitational waves were observed, which are the size of a human city.) But from the center of our galaxy, it takes light tens of thousands of years to reach Earth, and at such a great distance, this big black hole appears as small as would a tiny grain of sand from a plane at cruising altitude. Try to see the sand grains on a beach from a plane window!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, although M87 lies about two thousand times further away, its central black hole has a mass and radius about two thousand times larger than our galaxy&#8217;s black hole. Consequently it appears roughly the same size on the sky.</p>
<p>We may get our first images of both black holes at Wednesday&#8217;s announcement, though it is possible that so far only one image is ready for public presentation.</p>
<p><strong>How can one see something as black as a black hole?!?</strong></p>
<p>First of all, aren&#8217;t black holes black? Doesn&#8217;t that mean they don&#8217;t emit (or reflect) any light? Yes, and yes. <em>[With a caveat &#8212; Hawking radiation &#8212; but while that&#8217;s very important for extremely small black holes, it&#8217;s completely irrelevant for these ones.]</em></p>
<p>So how can we see something that&#8217;s black against a black night sky? Well, a black hole off by itself would indeed be almost invisible.  <em>[Though detectable because its gravity bends the light of objects behind it, proving it was a black hole and not a clump of, say, dark matter would be tough.]</em></p>
<p>But the centers of galaxies have lots of `gas&#8217; &#8212; not quite what we call `gas&#8217; in school, and certainly not what we put in our cars. `Gas&#8217; is the generalized term astronomers use for any collection of independently wandering atoms (or ions), atomic nuclei, and electrons; if it&#8217;s not just atoms it should really be called <em>plasma</em>, but let&#8217;s not worry about that here. Some of this `gas&#8217; is inevitably orbiting the black hole, and some of it is falling in (and, because of complex interactions with magnetic fields, some is being blasted outward  before it falls in.) That gas, unlike the black hole, <em><strong>will inevitably glow</strong></em> &#8212; it will emit lots of light. <strong>What the astronomers are observing isn&#8217;t the black hole; they&#8217;re observing light from the gas!</strong></p>
<p>And by light, I don&#8217;t only mean what we can see with human eyes. The gas emits electromagnetic waves of all frequencies, including not only the visible frequencies but also much higher frequencies, such as those we call X-rays, and much lower frequencies, such as those we call radio waves. To detect these invisible forms of light, astronomers build all sorts of scientific instruments, which we call them `telescopes&#8217; even though they don&#8217;t involve looking into a tube as with traditional telescopes.</p>
<p><strong>Is this really a &#8220;photograph&#8221; of <em>[the gas in the neighborhood of]</em> a black hole?</strong></p>
<p>Yes and (mostly) no.  What you&#8217;ll be shown is not a picture you could take with a cell-phone camera if you were in a nearby spaceship.  It&#8217;s not visible light that&#8217;s being observed.  But it is invisible light &#8212; radio waves &#8212; and since all light, visible and not, is made from particles called `photons&#8217;, technically you could still say is a &#8220;photo&#8221;-graph.</p>
<p>As I said, the telescope being used in this doesn&#8217;t have a set of mirrors in a tube like your friendly neighbor&#8217;s amateur telescope. Instead, it uses radio receivers to detect electromagnetic waves that have frequencies above what your traditional radio or cell phone can detect<em> [in the hundred gigahertz range, over a thousand times above what your FM radio is sensitive to.]</em>  Though some might call them microwaves, let&#8217;s just call them radio waves; it&#8217;s just a matter of definition.</p>
<p>So the images you will see are based on the observation of electromagnetic waves at these radio frequencies, but they are turned into something visible for us humans using a computer. That means <strong><em>the color of the image is inserted by the computer user and will be arbitrary,</em></strong> so pay it limited attention. It&#8217;s not the color you would see if you were nearby.  <em><strong>Scientists will choose a combination of the color and brightness of the image so as to indicate the brightness of the radio waves observed.</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="color:var(--color-neutral-600);">If you were nearby and looked toward the black hole, you&#8217;d see something else. The gas would probably appear colorless &#8212; white-hot &#8212; and the shape and brightness, though similar, wouldn&#8217;t be identical.</span></p>
<p><strong>If I had radios for eyes, is this what I would see?</strong></p>
<p>Suppose you had radio receivers for eyes instead of the ones you were born with; is this image what you would see if you looked at the black hole from a nearby planet?</p>
<p>Well, to some extent &#8212; but still, not exactly.  There&#8217;s another very important way that what you will see is not a photograph. It is so difficult to make this measurement that <strong><em>the image you will see is highly processed</em></strong> &#8212; that is to say, it will have been cleaned up and adjusted using special mathematics and powerful computers. Various assumptions are key ingredients in this image-processing. Thus, you will not be seeing the `true&#8217; appearance of the [surroundings of the] black hole. <em><strong>You will be seeing the astronomers&#8217; best guess</strong></em> as to this appearance based on partial information and some very intelligent guesswork. Such guesswork may be right, but as we may learn only over time, some of it may not be.</p>
<p>This guesswork is necessary.  To make a nice clear image of something so tiny and faint using radio waves, you&#8217;d naively need a radio receiver as large as the Earth. A trick astronomers use when looking at distant objects it to build gigantic <strong><em>arrays</em></strong> of large radio receivers, which can be combined together to make a `telescope&#8217; much larger and more powerful than any one receiver. The tricks for doing this efficiently are beyond what I can explain here, but involve the term `<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very-long-baseline_interferometry">interferometry</a>&#8216;. Examples of large radio telescope arrays include ALMA, the center part of which can be <a href="https://www.almaobservatory.org/en/images/aerial-view-of-antennas-in-aos-4/">seen in this image</a>, which was built high up on a plateau between two volcanoes in the Atacama desert.</p>
<p>But even ALMA isn&#8217;t up to the task. And we can&#8217;t make a version of ALMA that covers the Earth. So the next best thing is to use ALMA and all of its friends, which are scattered at different locations around the Earth &#8212; <em><strong>an incomplete array of single and multiple radio receivers, combined using all the tricks of interferometry.</strong></em> This is a bit like (and not like) using a telescope that is powerful but has large pieces of its lens missing. You can get an image, but it will be badly distorted.</p>
<p>To figure out what you&#8217;re seeing, you must use your knowledge of your imperfect lens, and <strong><em>work backwards to figure our what your distorted image really would have looked like</em></strong> if you had a perfect lens.</p>
<p>Even that&#8217;s not quite enough: to do this, you need to have a pretty good guess about what you were going to see. That is where you might go astray; <em><strong>if your assumptions are wrong, you might massage the image to look like what you expected instead of how it really ought to look.</strong></em>  <em> [Is this a serious risk?   I&#8217;m not yet expert enough to know the details of how delicate the situation might be.]</em></p>
<p>It is possible that in coming days and weeks there will be controversies about whether the image-processing techniques used and the assumptions underlying them have created artifacts in the images that really shouldn&#8217;t be there, or removed features that should have been there. This could lead to significant disagreements as to how to interpret the images. <em>[Consider these concerns a statement of general prudence based on past experience; I don&#8217;t have enough specific expertise here to give a more detailed opinion.]</em></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff6600;">So in summary, <strong>this is not a photograph you&#8217;d see with your eyes, and it&#8217;s not a complete unadulterated image</strong> &#8212; it&#8217;s a highly-processed image of what a creature with radio eyes might see.  The color is arbitrary; some combination of color and brightness will express the intensity of the radio waves, nothing more.  Treat the images with proper caution and respect.</span></p>
<p><strong>Will the image show what <em>[the immediate neighborhood of]</em> a black hole looks like?</strong></p>
<p>Oh, my friends and colleagues! Could we please try to be a little more careful using the phrase `<strong>looks like</strong>&#8216;? The term has two very different meanings, and in contexts like this one, it really, really matters.</p>
<p>Let me put a spoon into a glass of water: on the left, I&#8217;ve drawn a diagram of what it <strong><span style="color:#008000;">looks like</span></strong>, and on the right, I&#8217;ve put a photograph of what it <span style="color:#993366;"><em><strong>looks like</strong></em></span>.</p>

<p>You notice the difference, no doubt. The spoon on the left looks like a spoon; the spoon on the right looks like something invented by a surrealist painter.  But it&#8217;s just the effect of water and glass on light.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s on the left is a drawing of where the spoon is located inside the glass; it shows not what you would see with your eyes, but rather <strong>a depiction of the `true location&#8217; of the spoon</strong>. On the right is what you will see with your eyes and brain, which is not showing you where the objects are in truth but rather is <strong>showing you where the light from those objects is coming from</strong>. The truth-depiction is drawn as though the light from the object goes straight from the object into your eyes. But <em><strong>when the light from an object does not take a straight path from the objects to you</strong></em> &#8212; as in this case, where the light&#8217;s path bends due to interaction of the light with the water and the glass &#8212; <em><strong>then</strong></em> <em><strong>the image created in your eyes or camera can significantly differ from a depiction of the truth.</strong></em></p>
<p>The same issue arises, of course, with any sort of lens or mirror that isn&#8217;t flat. A room seen through a curved lens, or through an old, misshapen window pane, can look pretty strange.  And gravity? <em><strong>Strong gravity near a black hole drastically modifies the path of any light traveling close by!</strong></em></p>
<p>In the figure below, the left panel shows a depiction of what we think the region around a black hole typically looks like <em><strong>in truth</strong></em>. There is a spinning disk of gas, called the accretion disk, a sort of holding station for the gas. At any moment, a small fraction of the gas, at the inner edge of the disk, has crept too close to the black hole and is starting to spiral in. There are also usually jets of material flying out, roughly aligned with the axis of the black hole&#8217;s rapid rotation and its magnetic field. As I mentioned above, that material is being flung out of the black hole&#8217;s neighborhood (not out of the black hole itself, which would be impossible.)</p>

That is an image of the radio waves as observed here at Earth, after the waves&#8217; paths have been wildly bent &#8212; warped by the intense gravity near the black hole. Just as with any lens or mirror or anything similar, what you will see does not directly reveal what is truly there. Instead, <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em><strong>you must infer what is there from what you see.</strong></em></span></p>
<p>Just as you infer, when you see the broken twisted spoon in the glass, that probably the spoon is not broken or twisted, and the water and glass have refracted the light in familiar ways, so too we must make assumptions to understand what we&#8217;re really looking at in truth after we see the images tomorrow.</p>
<p>How serious are these assumptions?  Certainly, at their first attempt, astronomers will assume Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity, which predicts how the light is bent around a black hole, is correct. But the details of what we infer from what we&#8217;re shown might depend upon whether Einstein&#8217;s formulas are precisely right. It also may depend on the accuracy of our understanding of and assumptions about accretion disks. Further complicating the procedure is that the rate and axis of the black hole&#8217;s rotation affects the details of the bending of the light, and since we&#8217;re not sure of the rotation yet for these black holes, that adds to the assumptions that must gradually be disentangled.</p>
<p><span style="color:#993366;"><strong><em>Because of these assumptions, we will not have an unambiguous understanding of the true nature of what appears in these first images.</em></strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Are we seeing the `shadow&#8217; of a black hole?</strong></p>
<p>A shadow: that&#8217;s what astronomers call it, but as far as I can tell, this word is jargon masquerading as English&#8230; the most pernicious type of jargon.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s a shadow, in English? Your shadow is a dark area on the ground created by you blocking the light from the Sun, which emits light and illuminates the area around you. How would I see your shadow? I&#8217;d look at the ground &#8212; not at you.</p>
<p>This is not what we are doing in this case. The gas is glowing, illuminating the region. The black hole is `blocking&#8217; <em>[caution! see below]</em> some of the light. We&#8217;re looking straight toward the black hole, and seeing dark areas where illumination doesn&#8217;t reach us. This is more like looking at someone&#8217;s silhouette, not someone&#8217;s shadow!</p>

[I&#8217;ve drawn the shadow slightly askew to avoid visual confusion.]  In the black hole images, illumination is provided by the glowing gas, and we&#8217;ll see a sort-of-silhouette [but see below!!!] of the black hole.  There&#8217;s nothing analogous to the ground, or to the person&#8217;s shadow, in the black hole images.</p></div>That being said, <em><strong>it&#8217;s much more clever than a simple silhouette</strong></em>, because of all that pesky bending of the light that the black hole is doing.  In an ordinary silhouette, the light from the illuminator travels in straight lines, and an object blocks part of the light.   But a black hole does not block your view of what&#8217;s behind it;  the light from the gas <strong>behind</strong> it gets bent <strong>around</strong> it, and thus can be seen after all!</p>
<p>Still, after you calculate all the bending, <del>you find out that there&#8217;s a dark area from which no light emerges, which I&#8217;ll informally call a <strong>quasi-silhouette</strong>.  Just outside this is a `photon-sphere&#8217;, which creates a bright ring</del>; <span style="color:#ff0000;">THIS STATEMENT, MADE IN ALL THE PRESS ARTICLES I COULD FIND, IS MISLEADING, AS ARE THE THREE PARAGRAPHS THAT FOLLOW THE IMAGE BELOW; THEY ARE TRUE FOR A PERFECT CAMERA, BUT NOT FOR A CAMERA THAT CAN BARELY SEE THE IMAGE.

<p>Note also that the black hole&#8217;s quasi-silhouette probably won&#8217;t be entirely dark. If material from the accretion disk (or a jet pointing toward us) lies between us and the black hole, it can emit light in our direction, partly filling in the dark region.</p>
<p>Thus the quasi-silhouette we&#8217;ll see in the images is not the outline of the black hole&#8217;s edge, but an effect of the light bending, and is in fact considerably larger than the black hole.  <strong>In truth</strong> it may be as much as 50% larger in radius than the event horizon, and the silhouette as seen in the image <strong>may appear </strong> more than 2.5 to 5 times larger (depending on how fast the black hole rotates) than the true event horizon &#8212; all due to the bent paths of the radio waves. <em>Note Added: THIS ASSUMES THAT THE QUASI-SILHOUETTE IS NOT SUBSTANTIALLY FILLED IN, WHICH, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/06/14/a-ring-of-controversy-around-a-black-hole-photo">IT TURNS OUT</a>, MAY NOT BE TRUE.</em></p>
<p><em>Interestingly, it turns out that the details of how the black hole is rotating don&#8217;t much affect the size of the quasi-silhouette. <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/06/14/a-ring-of-controversy-around-a-black-hole-photo">Note Added: THIS IS TRUE, BUT NOT ENTIRELY RELEVANT WHEN USING AN IMPERFECT CAMERA.</a>  The black hole in the Milky Way is already understood well enough that astronomers know how big its quasi-silhouette ought to appear, even though we don&#8217;t know its rotation speed and axis.  <strong>The quasi-silhouette&#8217;s size in the image will therefore be an important test of Einstein&#8217;s formulas for gravity, even on day one.</strong>  If the size disagrees with expectations, expect a lot of hullabaloo.</em></p>
<p><strong>What is the event horizon, and is it present in the image?</strong></p>
<p>The event horizon of a black hole, in Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity, is not an object. It&#8217;s the edge of a region of no-return, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/black-holes/black-hole-information-paradox-an-introduction/">as I&#8217;ve explained here</a>. Anything that goes past that point can&#8217;t re-emerge, and nothing that happens inside can ever send any light or messages back out.</p>
<p>Despite what some writers are saying, we&#8217;re not expecting to see the event horizon in the images. As is hopefully clear by now, what astronomers are observing is (a) the radio waves from the gas near the black hole, after the waves have taken strongly curved paths, and (b) a quasi-silhouette of the black hole from which radio waves don&#8217;t emerge. But as I explained above, <em><strong>this quasi-silhouette is considerably larger than the event horizon, </strong></em>both in truth and in appearance. The event horizon does not emit any light, and it sits well inside the quasi-silhouette, not at its edge.</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">Still, <em><strong>what we&#8217;ll be seeing is closer to the event horizon than anything we&#8217;ve ever seen before</strong></em>, which is really exciting!   And if the silhouette has an unexpected appearance, we just might get our first hint of a breakdown of Einstein&#8217;s understanding of event horizons.  Don&#8217;t bet on it, but you can hope for it.</span></p>
<p><strong>Can we hope to see the singularity of a black hole?</strong></p>
<p>No, for two reasons.</p>
<p>First, <strong><em>there probably is no singularity in the first place</em></strong>. It drives me nuts when people say there&#8217;s a singularity inside a black hole; that&#8217;s just wrong. The correct statement is that in Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity, singularities (i.e. unavoidable infinities) arise <em><strong>in the math</strong></em> &#8212; in the <em><strong>formulas</strong></em> for black holes (or more precisely, in the solutions to those formulas that describe black holes.) But <em><strong>a singularity in the math</strong></em> <em><strong>does not mean that there&#8217;s a singularity in nature!  </strong></em>It usually means that the math isn&#8217;t quite right &#8212; not that anyone made a mistake, but that the formulas that we&#8217;re using aren&#8217;t appropriate, and need to be modified in some way, because of some natural phenomenon that we don&#8217;t yet understand.</p>
<p>A singularity in a formula implies a <strong>mystery</strong> in nature &#8212; <em><strong>not</strong></em> <strong>a singularity</strong> in nature.</p>
<p>In fact, historically, in every previous case where singularities have appeared in formulas, it simply meant that the formula (or solution) was not accurate in that context, or wasn&#8217;t being used correctly. We already know that Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity can&#8217;t be complete (it doesn&#8217;t accommodate quantum physics, which is also a part of the real world) and it would be no surprise if its incompleteness is responsible for these infinities. The math singularity merely signifies that the physics very deep inside a black hole isn&#8217;t understood yet.</p>
<p><em>[The same issue afflicts the statement that <strong>the Big Bang began with a singularity</strong>; the solution to the equations has a singularity, yes, but that&#8217;s very far from saying that nature&#8217;s Big Bang actually began with one.]</em></p>
<p>Ok, so how about revising the question: is there any hope of seeing the region deep inside the black hole where Einstein&#8217;s equations have a singularity? No. Remember what&#8217;s being observed is the stuff outside the black hole, and the black hole&#8217;s quasi-silhouette. What happens inside a black hole stays inside a black hole. Anything else is inference.</p>
<p><em>[More precisely, what happens inside a huge black hole stays inside a black hole for eons.  For tiny black holes it comes out sooner, but even so it is hopelessly scrambled in the form of `Hawking radiation.&#8217;]</em></p>
<p><strong>Any other questions?</strong></p>
<p>Maybe there are some questions that are bothering readers that I haven&#8217;t addressed here?  I&#8217;m super-busy this afternoon and all day Wednesday with non-physics things, but maybe if you ask the question early enough I can get address it here before the press conference (at 9 am Wednesday, New York City time).   Also, if you find my answers confusing, please comment; I can try to further clarify them for later readers.</p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;"><strong>It&#8217;s a historic moment, or at least the first stage in a historic process.  To me, as I hope to all of you, it&#8217;s all very exciting and astonishing how the surreal weirdness of Einstein&#8217;s understanding of gravity, and the creepy mysteries of black holes, have suddenly, in just a few quick years, become undeniably real!</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There has long been a question as to what types of events and processes are responsible for the highest-energy neutrinos coming from space and observed by scientists.  Another question, probably related, is what creates the majority of high-energy <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/04/03/ams-presents-some-first-results/">cosmic rays</a> &#8212; the particles, mostly <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/">protons</a>, that are constantly raining down upon the Earth.</p>
<p>As scientists&#8217; ability to detect high-energy neutrinos <em>(particles that are hugely abundant, electrically neutral, very light-weight, and <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/how-one-detects-neutrinos/">very difficult to observe</a>)</em> and high-energy photons <em>(particles of light, though not necessarily of visible light) </em>have become more powerful and precise, there&#8217;s been considerable hope of getting an answer to these question.  One of the things we&#8217;ve been awaiting (<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/05/09/neutrinos-from-that-recent-gamma-ray-burst/">and been disappointed</a> a couple of times) is a violent explosion out in the universe that produces both high-energy photons and neutrinos at the same time, at a high enough rate that both types of particles can be observed at the same time coming from the same direction.</p>
<p>In recent years, there has been some indirect evidence that blazars &#8212; narrow jets of particles, pointed in our general direction like the barrel of a gun, and created as material swirls near and almost into giant black holes in the centers of very distant galaxies &#8212; may be responsible for the high-energy neutrinos.  Strong direct evidence in favor of this hypothesis has just been presented today.   Last year, one of these blazars flared brightly, and the flare created both high-energy neutrinos and high-energy photons that were observed within the same period, coming from the same place in the sky.</p>
<p><a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/how-one-detects-neutrinos/icecube-a-giant-frozen-neutrino-catcher/">I have written about the IceCube neutrino observatory before</a>; it&#8217;s a cubic kilometer of ice under the South Pole, instrumented with light detectors, and it&#8217;s ideal for observing neutrinos whose motion-energy far exceeds that of the protons in the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">Large Hadron Collider</a>, where the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/why-the-higgs-particle-matters/">Higgs particle</a> was discovered.  These neutrinos mostly pass through Ice Cube undetected, but one in 100,000 hits something, and debris from the collision produces visible light that Ice Cube&#8217;s detectors can record.   IceCube has already made important discoveries, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/05/16/possible-important-discovery-at-icecube/">detecting a new class of high-energy neutrinos</a>.</p>
<p>On Sept 22 of last year, one of these very high-energy neutrinos was observed at IceCube. More precisely, a muon created underground by the collision of this neutrino with an atomic nucleus <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/how-one-detects-neutrinos/icecube-a-giant-frozen-neutrino-catcher/">was observed in</a> IceCube.  To create the observed muon, the neutrino must have had a motion-energy tens of thousand times larger than than the motion-energy of each proton at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).  And the direction of the neutrino&#8217;s motion is known too; it&#8217;s essentially the same as that of the observed muon.  So IceCube&#8217;s scientists knew where, on the sky, this neutrino had come from.</p>
<p><em>(This doesn&#8217;t work for typical cosmic rays; protons, for instance, travel in curved paths because they are deflected by cosmic magnetic fields, so even if you measure their travel direction at their arrival to Earth, you don&#8217;t then know where they came from. Neutrinos, beng electrically neutral, aren&#8217;t affected by magnetic fields and travel in a straight line, just as photons do.)</em></p>
<p>Very close to that direction is a well-known blazar (TXS-0506), four billion light years away (a good fraction of the distance across the visible universe).</p>
<p>The IceCube scientists immediately reported their neutrino observation to scientists with high-energy photon detectors.  (I&#8217;ve also written about some of the detectors used to study the very high-energy photons that we find in the sky: in particular, the <a href="http://www-glast.stanford.edu/">Fermi/LAT satellite</a> played a role in this latest discovery.) Fermi/LAT, which continuously monitors the sky, was already detecting high-energy photons coming from the same direction.   Within a few days the Fermi scientists had confirmed that TXS-0506 was indeed flaring at the time &#8212; already starting in April 2017 in fact, six times as bright as normal.  With this news from IceCube and Fermi/LAT, many other telescopes (including the <a href="https://wwwmagic.mpp.mpg.de/">MAGIC cosmic ray detector telescopes</a> among others) then followed suit and studied the blazar, learning more about the properties of its flare.</p>
<p>Now, just a single neutrino on its own isn&#8217;t entirely convincing; is it possible that this was all just a coincidence?  So the IceCube folks went back to their older data to snoop around.  There they discovered, in their 2014-2015 data, a dramatic flare <strong><em>in neutrinos</em></strong> &#8212; more than a dozen neutrinos, seen over 150 days, had come from the same direction in the sky where TXS-0506 is sitting.  (More precisely, nearly 20 from this direction were seen, in a time period where normally there&#8217;d just be 6 or 7 by random chance.)  This confirms that this blazar is indeed a source of neutrinos.  And from the energies of the neutrinos in this flare, yet more can be learned about this blazar, and how it makes  high-energy photons and neutrinos at the same time.  Interestingly, so far at least, there&#8217;s no strong evidence for this 2014 flare in photons, except perhaps an increase in the number of the highest-energy photons&#8230; but not in the total brightness of the source.</p>
<p>The full picture, still emerging, tends to support the idea that the blazar arises from a supermassive black hole, acting as a natural particle accelerator, making a narrow spray of particles, <em><strong>including protons</strong></em>, at extremely high energy.  These protons, millions of times more energetic than those at the Large Hadron Collider, then collide with more ordinary particles that are just wandering around, such as visible-light photons from starlight or infrared photons from the ambient heat of the universe.  The collisions <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/09/23/how-to-make-a-neutrino-beam/">produce particles called pions, made from quarks and anti-quarks and gluons (just as protons are), which in turn decay either to photons or to (among other things) neutrinos</a>.  And its those resulting photons and neutrinos which have now been jointly observed.</p>
<p>Since cosmic rays, the mysterious high energy particles from outer space that are constantly raining down on our planet, are mostly protons, <em><strong>this is evidence that many, perhaps most, of the highest energy cosmic rays are created in the natural particle accelerators associated with blazars.</strong></em> Many scientists have suspected that the most extreme cosmic rays are associated with the most active black holes at the centers of galaxies, and now we have evidence and more details in favor of this idea.  It now appears likely that that this question will be answerable over time, as more blazar flares are observed and studied.</p>
<p>The announcement of this important discovery was made at the National Science Foundation by Francis Halzen, the IceCube principal investigator, Olga Botner, former IceCube spokesperson, Regina Caputo, the Fermi-LAT analysis coordinator, and Razmik Mirzoyan, MAGIC spokesperson.</p>
<p>The fact that both photons and neutrinos have been observed from the same source is an example of what people are now calling &#8220;multi-messenger astronomy&#8221;; a previous example was<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2017/10/17/the-significance-of-yesterdays-gravitational-wave-announcement-an-faq/"> the observation in gravitational waves, and in photons of many different energies, of two merging neutron stars</a>.  Of course, something like this already happened in <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/09/20/supernovas-and-neutrinos/">1987, when a supernova was seen by eye, and also observed in neutrinos</a>.  But in this case, the neutrinos and photons have energies millions and billions of times larger!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2017/10/16/a-scientific-breakthrough-combining-gravitational-and-electromagnetic-waves/">Yesterday&#8217;s post</a> on the results from the LIGO/VIRGO network of gravitational wave detectors was aimed at getting information out, rather than providing the pedagogical backdrop.  Today I&#8217;m following up with a post that attempts to answer some of the questions that my readers and my personal friends asked me.  Some wanted to understand better how to visualize what had happened, while others wanted more clarity on why the discovery was so important.  So I&#8217;ve put together a post which  (1) explains what neutron stars and black holes are and what their mergers are like, (2) clarifies why yesterday&#8217;s announcement was important &#8212; and there were many reasons, which is why it&#8217;s hard to reduce it all to a single soundbite.  And (3) there are some miscellaneous questions at the end.</p>
<p>First, a disclaimer: I am *not* an expert in the very complex subject of neutron star mergers and the resulting explosions, called kilonovas.  These are much more complicated than black hole mergers.  I am still learning some of the details.  Hopefully I&#8217;ve avoided errors, but you&#8217;ll notice a few places where I don&#8217;t know the answers &#8230; yet.  Perhaps my more expert colleagues will help me fill in the gaps over time.</p>
<p>Please, if you spot any errors, don&#8217;t hesitate to comment!!  And feel free to ask additional questions whose answers I can add to the list.</p>
<p><strong>BASIC QUESTIONS ABOUT NEUTRON STARS, BLACK HOLES, AND MERGERS</strong></p>
<p><strong>What are neutron stars and black holes, and how are they related?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/">Every atom is made from a tiny atomic nucleus, made of neutrons and protons (which are very similar), and loosely surrounded by electrons.</a> Most of an atom is empty space, so it can, under extreme circumstances, be crushed &#8212; but only if every electron and proton convert to a neutron (which remains behind) and a neutrino (which heads off into outer space.) When a giant star runs out of fuel, the pressure from its furnace turns off, and it collapses inward under its own weight, creating just those extraordinary conditions in which the matter can be crushed. Thus: a star&#8217;s interior, with a mass one to several times the Sun&#8217;s mass, is all turned into a several-mile(kilometer)-wide ball of neutrons &#8212; the number of neutrons approaching a 1 with 57 zeroes after it.</p>
<p>If the star is big but not too big, the neutron ball stiffens and holds its shape, and the star explodes outward, blowing itself to pieces in a what is called a core-collapse supernova. The ball of neutrons remains behind; this is what we call a neutron star. It&#8217;s a ball of the densest material that we know can exist in the universe &#8212; a pure atomic nucleus many miles(kilometers) across. It has a very hard surface; if you tried to go inside a neutron star, your experience would be a lot worse than running into a closed door at a hundred miles per hour.</p>
<p>If the star is very big indeed, the neutron ball that forms may immediately (or soon) collapse under its own weight, forming a black hole. A supernova may or may not result in this case; the star might just disappear. A black hole is very, very different from a neutron star. Black holes are what&#8217;s left when matter collapses irretrievably upon itself under the pull of gravity, shrinking down endlessly. While a neutron star has a surface that you could smash your head on, a black hole has no surface &#8212; it has an edge that is simply a point of no return, called a horizon. In Einstein&#8217;s theory, you can just go right through, as if passing through an open door. You won&#8217;t even notice the moment you go in. <em>[Note: this is true in Einstein&#8217;s theory. But there is a big controversy as to whether the combination of Einstein&#8217;s theory with quantum physics changes the horizon into something novel and dangerous to those who enter; this is known as the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/black-holes/black-hole-information-paradox-an-introduction/">firewall controversy</a>, and would take us too far afield into speculation.] </em> But once you pass through that door, you can never return.</p>
<p>Black holes can form in other ways too, but not those that we&#8217;re observing with the LIGO/VIRGO detectors.</p>
<p><strong>Why are their mergers the best sources for gravitational waves?</strong></p>
<p>One of the easiest and most obvious ways to make gravitational waves is to have two objects orbiting each other.  If you put your two fists in a pool of water and move them around each other, you&#8217;ll get a pattern of water waves spiraling outward; this is in rough (<em>very</em> rough!) analogy to what happens with two orbiting objects, although, since the objects are moving in space, the waves aren&#8217;t in a material like water.  They are waves in space itself.</p>
<p>To get powerful gravitational waves, you want objects each with a very big mass that are orbiting around each other at very high speed. To get the fast motion, you need the force of gravity between the two objects to be strong; and to get gravity to be as strong as possible, you need the two objects to be as close as possible (since, as Isaac Newton already knew, gravity between two objects grows stronger when the distance between them shrinks.) But if the objects are large, they can&#8217;t get too close; they will bump into each other and merge long before their orbit can become fast enough. So to get a really fast orbit, you need <strong>two relatively small objects, each with a relatively big mass</strong> &#8212; what scientists refer to as <strong>compact objects</strong>. Neutron stars and black holes are the most compact objects we know about. Fortunately, they do indeed often travel in orbiting pairs, and do sometimes, for a very brief period before they merge, orbit rapidly enough to produce gravitational waves that LIGO and VIRGO can observe.</p>
<p><strong>Why do we find these objects in pairs in the first place?</strong></p>
<p>Stars very often travel in pairs&#8230; they are called binary stars. They can start their lives in pairs, forming together in large gas clouds, or even if they begin solitary, they can end up pairing up if they live in large densely packed communities of stars where it is common for multiple stars to pass nearby. Perhaps surprisingly, their pairing can survive the collapse and explosion of either star, leaving two black holes, two neutron stars, or one of each in orbit around one another.</p>
<p><strong>What happens when these objects merge?</strong></p>
<p>Not surprisingly, there are three classes of mergers which can be detected: two black holes merging, two neutron stars merging, and a neutron star merging with a black hole. The first class was observed in 2015 (and <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2016/02/11/advance-thoughts-on-ligo/">announced in 2016</a>), the second was announced <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2017/10/16/a-scientific-breakthrough-combining-gravitational-and-electromagnetic-waves/">yesterday</a>, and it&#8217;s a matter of time before the third class is observed. The two objects may orbit each other for billions of years, very slowly radiating gravitational waves (an effect <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/04/30/did-bicep2-detect-gravitational-waves-directly-or-indirectly/">observed in the 70&#8217;s, leading to a Nobel Prize</a>) and gradually coming closer and closer together. Only in the last day of their lives do their orbits really start to speed up. And just before these objects merge, they begin to orbit each other once per second, then ten times per second, then a hundred times per second. Visualize that if you can: objects a few dozen miles (kilometers) across, a few miles (kilometers) apart, each with the mass of the Sun or greater, orbiting each other <em><span style="color:#ff0000;">100 times each second</span></em>. It&#8217;s truly mind-boggling &#8212; a spinning dumbbell beyond the imagination of even the greatest minds of the 19th century. I don&#8217;t know any scientist who isn&#8217;t awed by this vision. It all sounds like science fiction. But it&#8217;s not.</p>
<p><strong>How do we know this isn&#8217;t science fiction?</strong></p>
<p>We know, if we believe Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity (and I&#8217;ll give you a very good reason to believe in it in just a moment.) Einstein&#8217;s theory predicts that such a rapidly spinning, large-mass dumbbell formed by two orbiting compact objects will produce a telltale pattern of ripples in space itself &#8212; gravitational waves. That pattern is both complicated and precisely predicted. In the case of black holes, the predictions go right up to and past the moment of merger, to the ringing of the larger black hole that forms in the merger. In the case of neutron stars, the instants just before, during and after the merger are more complex and we can&#8217;t yet be confident we understand them, but during tens of seconds before the merger Einstein&#8217;s theory is very precise about what to expect. The theory further predicts how those ripples will cross the vast distances from where they were created to the location of the Earth, and how they will appear in the LIGO/VIRGO network of three gravitational wave detectors. The prediction of what to expect at LIGO/VIRGO thus involves not just one prediction but many: the theory is used to predict the existence and properties of black holes and of neutron stars, the detailed features of their mergers, the precise patterns of the resulting gravitational waves, and how those gravitational waves cross space. That LIGO/VIRGO have detected the telltale patterns of these gravitational waves. That these wave patterns agree with Einstein&#8217;s theory in every detail is the strongest evidence ever obtained that there is nothing wrong with Einstein&#8217;s theory when used in these combined contexts.  That then in turn gives us confidence that our interpretation of the LIGO/VIRGO results is correct, confirming that black holes and neutron stars really exist and really merge. <em>(Notice the reasoning is slightly circular&#8230; but that&#8217;s how scientific knowledge proceeds, as a set of detailed consistency checks that gradually and eventually become so tightly interconnected as to be almost impossible to unwind.  Scientific reasoning is not deductive; it is inductive.  We do it not because it is logically ironclad but because it works so incredibly well &#8212; as witnessed by the computer, and its screen, that I&#8217;m using to write this, and the wired and wireless internet and computer disk that will be used to transmit and store it.)</em></p>
<p><strong>THE SIGNIFICANCE(S) OF YESTERDAY&#8217;S ANNOUNCEMENT OF A NEUTRON STAR MERGER</strong></p>
<p>What makes it difficult to explain the significance of yesterday&#8217;s announcement is that it consists of many important results piled up together, rather than a simple takeaway that can be reduced to a single soundbite. (That was also true of the black hole mergers announcement back in 2016, which is why I wrote <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2016/02/11/advance-thoughts-on-ligo/">a long post about it.</a>)</p>
<p>So here is a list of important things we learned.  No one of them, by itself, is earth-shattering, but each one is profound, and taken together they form a major event in scientific history.</p>
<p><strong>First confirmed observation of a merger of two neutron stars</strong>: We&#8217;ve known these mergers must occur, but there&#8217;s nothing like being sure. And since these things are too far away and too small to see in a telescope, <em>the only way to be sure these mergers occur, and to learn more details about them, is with gravitational waves</em>.  We expect to see many more of these mergers in coming years as gravitational wave astronomy increases in its sensitivity, and we will learn more and more about them.</p>
<p><strong>New information about the properties of neutron stars:</strong> Neutron stars were proposed almost a hundred years ago and were confirmed to exist in the 60&#8217;s and 70&#8217;s.  But their precise details aren&#8217;t known; we believe they are like a giant atomic nucleus, but they&#8217;re so vastly larger than ordinary atomic nuclei that can&#8217;t be sure we understand all of their internal properties, and there are debates in the scientific community that can&#8217;t be easily answered&#8230; until, perhaps, now.</p>
<p>From the detailed pattern of the gravitational waves of this one neutron star merger, scientists already learn two things. First, we confirm that Einstein&#8217;s theory correctly predicts the basic pattern of gravitational waves from orbiting neutron stars, as it does for orbiting and merging black holes. Unlike black holes, however, there are more questions about what happens to neutron stars when they merge. The question of what happened to this pair after they merged is still out &#8212; did the form a neutron star, an unstable neutron star that, slowing its spin, eventually collapsed into a black hole, or a black hole straightaway?</p>
<p>But something important was already learned about the internal properties of neutron stars. The stresses of being whipped around at such incredible speeds would tear you and I apart, and would even tear the Earth apart. We know neutron stars are much tougher than ordinary rock, but how much more? If they were too flimsy, they&#8217;d have broken apart at some point during LIGO/VIRGO&#8217;s observations, and the simple pattern of gravitational waves that was expected would have suddenly become much more complicated. That didn&#8217;t happen until perhaps just before the merger.   So scientists can use the simplicity of the pattern of gravitational waves to infer some new things about how stiff and strong neutron stars are.  More mergers will improve our understanding.  Again, <em>there is no other simple way to obtain this information.</em></p>
<p><strong>First visual observation of an event that produces both immense gravitational waves and bright electromagnetic waves:</strong> Black hole mergers aren&#8217;t expected to create a brilliant light display, because, as I mentioned above, they&#8217;re more like open doors to an invisible playground than they are like rocks, so they merge rather quietly, without a big bright and hot smash-up.  But neutron stars are big balls of stuff, and so the smash-up can indeed create lots of heat and light of all sorts, just as you might naively expect.  By &#8220;light&#8221; I mean not just visible light but all forms of electromagnetic waves, at all wavelengths (and therefore at all frequencies.)  Scientists divide up the range of electromagnetic waves into categories. These categories are radio waves, microwaves, infrared light, visible light, ultraviolet light, X-rays, and gamma rays, listed from lowest frequency and largest wavelength to highest frequency and smallest wavelength.  (Note that these categories and the dividing lines between them are completely arbitrary, but the divisions are useful for various scientific purposes.  The <strong>only</strong> fundamental difference between yellow light, a radio wave, and a gamma ray is the wavelength and frequency; otherwise they&#8217;re exactly the same type of thing, a wave in the electric and magnetic fields.)</p>
<p>So if and when two neutron stars merge, we expect both gravitational waves and electromagnetic waves, the latter of many different frequencies created by many different effects that can arise when two huge balls of neutrons collide.  But just because we expect them doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re easy to see.  These mergers are pretty rare &#8212; perhaps one every hundred thousand years in each big galaxy like our own &#8212; so the ones we find using LIGO/VIRGO will generally be very far away.  If the light show is too dim, none of our telescopes will be able to see it.</p>
<p>But this light show was plenty bright.  Gamma ray detectors out in space detected it instantly, confirming that the gravitational waves from the two neutron stars led to a collision and merger that produced very high frequency light.  Already, that&#8217;s a first.  It&#8217;s as though one had seen lightning for years but never heard thunder; or as though one had observed the waves from hurricanes for years but never observed one in the sky.  Seeing both allows us a whole new set of perspectives; one plus one is often much more than two.</p>
<p>Over time &#8212; hours and days &#8212; effects were seen in visible light, ultraviolet light, infrared light, X-rays and radio waves.  Some were seen earlier than others, which itself is a story, but each one contributes to our understanding of what these mergers are actually like.</p>
<p><strong>Confirmation of the best guess concerning the origin of &#8220;short&#8221; gamma ray bursts</strong>:  For many years, bursts of gamma rays have been observed in the sky.  Among them, there seems to be a class of bursts that are shorter than most, typically lasting just a couple of seconds.  They come from all across the sky, indicating that they come from distant intergalactic space, presumably from distant galaxies.  Among other explanations, the most popular hypothesis concerning these short gamma-ray bursts has been that they come from merging neutron stars.  <em>The only way to confirm this hypothesis is with the observation of the gravitational waves from such a merger. </em> That test has now been passed; it appears that the hypothesis is correct.  That in turn means that we have, for the first time, both a good explanation of these short gamma ray bursts and, because we know how often we observe these bursts, a good estimate as to how often neutron stars merge in the universe.</p>
<p><strong>First distance measurement to a source using both a gravitational wave measure and a redshift in electromagnetic waves, allowing a new calibration of the distance scale of the universe and of its expansion rate:  </strong>The pattern over time of the gravitational waves from a merger of two black holes or neutron stars is complex enough to reveal many things about the merging objects, including a rough estimate of their masses and the orientation of the spinning pair relative to the Earth.  The overall strength of the waves, combined with the knowledge of the masses, reveals how far the pair is from the Earth.  That by itself is nice, but the real win comes when the discovery of the object using visible light, or in fact any light with frequency below gamma-rays, can be made.  In this case, the galaxy that contains the neutron stars can be determined.</p>
<p>Once we know the host galaxy, we can do something really important.  We can, by looking at the starlight, determine how rapidly the galaxy is moving away from us.  For distant galaxies, the speed at which the galaxy recedes should be related to its distance because the universe is expanding.</p>
<p>How rapidly the universe is expanding has been recently measured with remarkable precision, but the problem is that there are two different methods for making the measurement, <strong>and they disagree</strong>.   This disagreement is one of the most important problems for our understanding of the universe.  Maybe one of the measurement methods is flawed, or maybe &#8212; and this would be much more interesting &#8212; the universe simply doesn&#8217;t behave the way we think it does.</p>
<p>What gravitational waves do is give us a third method: the gravitational waves directly provide the distance to the galaxy, and the electromagnetic waves directly provide the speed of recession.  <em>There is no other way to make this type of joint measurement directly for distant galaxies.  </em>The method is not accurate enough to be useful in just one merger, but once dozens of mergers have been observed, the average result will provide important new information about the universe&#8217;s expansion.  When combined with the other methods, it may help resolve this all-important puzzle.</p>
<p><strong>Best test so far of Einstein&#8217;s prediction that the speed of light and the speed of gravitational waves are identical</strong>: Since gamma rays from the merger and the peak of the gravitational waves arrived within two seconds of one another after traveling 130 million years &#8212; that is, about 5 thousand million million seconds &#8212; we can say that the speed of light and the speed of gravitational waves are both equal to the cosmic speed limit to within one part in 2 thousand million million.  <em>Such a precise test requires the combination of gravitational wave and gamma ray observations.</em></p>
<p><strong>Efficient production of heavy elements confirmed</strong>:  It&#8217;s long been said that we are star-stuff, or stardust, and it&#8217;s been clear for a long time that it&#8217;s true.  But there&#8217;s been a puzzle when one looks into the details.  While it&#8217;s known that all the chemical elements from hydrogen up to iron are formed inside of stars, and can be blasted into space in supernova explosions to drift around and eventually form planets, moons, and humans, it hasn&#8217;t been quite as clear how the other elements with heavier atoms &#8212; atoms such as iodine, cesium, gold, lead, bismuth, uranium and so on &#8212; predominantly formed.  Yes they can be formed in supernovas, but not so easily; and there seem to be more atoms of heavy elements around the universe than supernovas can explain.  There are many supernovas in the history of the universe, but the efficiency for producing heavy chemical elements is just too low.</p>
<p>It was proposed some time ago that the mergers of neutron stars might be a suitable place to produce these heavy elements.  Even those these mergers are rare, they might be much more efficient, because the nuclei of heavy elements contain lots of neutrons and, not surprisingly, a collision of two neutron stars would produce lots of neutrons in its debris, suitable perhaps for making these nuclei.   A key indication that this is going on would be the following: if a neutron star merger could be identified using gravitational waves, and if its location could be determined using telescopes, then one would observe a pattern of light that would be characteristic of what is now called a &#8220;kilonova&#8221; explosion.   <em>Warning: I don&#8217;t yet know much about kilonovas and I may be leaving out important details.</em> A kilonova is powered by the process of forming heavy elements; most of the nuclei produced are initially radioactive &#8212; i.e., unstable &#8212; and they break down by emitting high energy particles, including the particles of light (called photons) which are in the gamma ray and X-ray categories.  The resulting characteristic glow would be expected to have a pattern of a certain type: it would be initially bright but would dim rapidly in visible light, with a long afterglow in infrared light.  The reasons for this are complex, so let me set them aside for now.  The important point is that this pattern was observed, confirming that a kilonova of this type occurred, and thus that, in this neutron star merger, enormous amounts of heavy elements were indeed produced.  So we now have a lot of evidence, for the first time, that almost all the heavy chemical elements on and around our planet were formed in neutron star mergers.  Again, <em>we could not know this if we did not know that this was a neutron star merger, and that information comes only from the gravitational wave observation.</em></p>
<p><strong>MISCELLANEOUS QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Did the merger of these two neutron stars result in a new black hole, a larger neutron star, or an unstable rapidly spinning neutron star that later collapsed into a black hole?</strong></p>
<p>We don&#8217;t yet know, and maybe we won&#8217;t know.  Some scientists involved appear to be leaning toward the possibility that a black hole was formed, but others seem to say the jury is out.  I&#8217;m not sure what additional information can be obtained over time about this.</p>
<p><strong>If the two neutron stars formed a black hole, why was there a kilonova?  Why wasn&#8217;t everything sucked into the black hole?</strong></p>
<p>Black holes aren&#8217;t vacuum cleaners; they pull things in via gravity just the same way that the Earth and Sun do, and don&#8217;t suck things in some unusual way.  The only crucial thing about a black hole is that once you go in you can&#8217;t come out.  But just as when trying to avoid hitting the Earth or Sun, you can avoid falling in if you orbit fast enough or if you&#8217;re flung outward before you reach the edge.</p>
<p>The point in a neutron star merger is that the forces at the moment of merger are so intense that one or both neutron stars are partially ripped apart.  The material that is thrown outward in all directions, at an immense speed, somehow creates the bright, hot flash of gamma rays and eventually the kilonova glow from the newly formed atomic nuclei.  Those details I don&#8217;t yet understand, but I know they have been carefully studied both with approximate equations and in computer simulations such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKEnayUC_ns">this one</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfNdr9sjlU8">this one</a>.  However, <em>the accuracy of the simulations can only be confirmed through the detailed studies of a merger, such as the one just announced.</em>  It seems, from the data we&#8217;ve seen, that the simulations did a fairly good job.  I&#8217;m sure they will be improved once they are compared with the recent data.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome, VIRGO!  Another <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2016/02/11/advance-thoughts-on-ligo/">merger</a> of two big black holes has been detected, <a href="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/news/ligo20170927">this time by both LIGO&#8217;s two detectors and by VIRGO as well.</a></p>
<p>Aside from the fact that this means that <a href="https://www.ego-gw.it/public/about/welcome.aspx">the VIRGO instrument</a> actually works, which is great news, why is this a big deal?  By adding a third gravitational wave detector, built by the VIRGO collaboration, to LIGO&#8217;s Washington and Louisiana detectors, the scientists involved in the search for gravitational waves now can determine fairly accurately the direction from which a detected gravitational wave signal is coming.  And this allows them to do something new: to tell their astronomer colleagues roughly where to look in the sky, using ordinary telescopes, for some form of electromagnetic waves (perhaps visible light, gamma rays, or radio waves) that might have been produced by whatever created the gravitational waves.<span id="more-9757"></span></p>
<p>The point is that with three detectors, one can triangulate.  The gravitational waves travel for billions of years, traveling at the speed of light, and when they pass by, they are detected at both LIGO detectors and at VIRGO.  But because it takes light a few thousandths of a second to travel the diameter of the Earth, the waves arrive at slightly different times at the LIGO Washington site, the LIGO Louisiana site, and the VIRGO site in Italy.  The precise timing tells the scientists what direction the waves were traveling in, and therefore roughly where they came from.  In a similar way, using the fact that sound travels at a known speed, the times that a gunshot is heard at multiple locations can be used by police to determine where the shot was fired.</p>
<p>You can see the impact in the picture below, which is an image of the sky drawn as a sphere, as if seen from outside the sky looking in.  In previous detections of black hole mergers by LIGO&#8217;s two detectors, the scientists could only determine a large swath of sky where the observed merger might have occurred; those are the four colored regions that stretch far across the sky.  But notice the green splotch at lower left.  That&#8217;s the region of sky where the black hole merger announced today occurred.  The fact that this region is many times smaller than the other four reflects what including VIRGO makes possible.  It&#8217;s a small enough region that one can search using an appropriate telescope for something that is making visible light, or gamma rays, or radio waves.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While a black hole merger isn&#8217;t expected to be observable by other telescopes, and indeed nothing was observed by other telescopes this time, other events that LIGO might detect, such as a merger of two neutron stars, may create an observable effect. We can hope for such exciting news over the next year or two.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s additional news from LIGO (the Laser Interferometry Gravitational Observatory) about gravitational waves today. What was <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2016/02/11/advance-thoughts-on-ligo/">a giant discovery just a few months ago</a> will soon become almost routine&#8230; but for now it is still very exciting&#8230;</p>
<p>LIGO got a Christmas (US) present: Dec 25th/26th 2015, two more black holes were detected coalescing 1.4 billion light years away &#8212; changing the length of LIGO&#8217;s arms by 300 parts in a trillion trillion, even less than the first merger observed in September. The black holes had 14 solar masses and 8 solar masses, and merged into a black hole with 21 solar masses, emitting 1 solar mass of energy in gravitational waves. In contrast to the September event, which was short and showed just a few orbits before the merger, in this event nearly 30 orbits over a full second are observed, making more information available to scientists about the black holes, the merger, and general relativity.  (Apparently one of the incoming black holes was spinning with at least 20% of the maximum possible rotation rate for a black hole.)</p>
<p>The signal is not so &#8220;bright&#8221; as the first one, so it cannot be seen by eye if you just look at the data; to find it, some clever mathematical techniques are needed. But the signal, after signal processing, is very clear. (Signal-to-noise ratio is 13; it was 24 for the September detection.) For such a clear signal to occur due to random noise is 5 standard deviations &#8212; officially a detection. The corresponding &#8220;chirp&#8221; is nowhere near so obvious, but there is a faint trace.</p>
<p>This gives two detections of black hole mergers over about 48 days of 2015 quality data. There&#8217;s also a third &#8220;candidate&#8221;, not so clear &#8212; signal-to-noise of just under 10. If it is really due to gravitational waves, it would be merging black holes again&#8230; midway in size between the September and December events&#8230; but it is borderline, and might just be a statistical fluke.</p>
<p>It is interesting that we already have two, maybe three, mergers of large black holes&#8230; and no mergers of neutron stars with black holes or with each other, which are harder to observe. It seems there really are a lot of big black holes in binary pairs out there in the universe. Incidentally, the question of whether they might form the dark matter of the universe has been raised; it&#8217;s still a long-shot idea, since there are arguments against it for black holes of this size, but seeing these merger rates one has to reconsider those arguments carefully and keep an open mind about the evidence.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s remember also that advanced-LIGO is still not running at full capacity. When LIGO starts its next run, six months long starting in September, the improvements over last year&#8217;s run will probably give a 50% to 100% increase in the rate for observed mergers.   In the longer run, the possibility of one merger per week is possible.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, VIRGO in Italy will come on line soon too, early in 2017. Japan and India are getting into the game too over the coming years. More detectors will allow scientists to know where on the sky the merger took place, which then can allow normal telescopes to look for flashes of light (or other forms of electromagnetic radiation) that might occur simultaneously with the merger&#8230; as is expected for neutron star mergers but not widely expected for black hole mergers.  The era of gravitational wave astronomy is underway.</p>
