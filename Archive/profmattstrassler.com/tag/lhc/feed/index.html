										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://lhcb-public.web.cern.ch/lhcb-public/">LHCb experiment</a> at the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/">Large Hadron Collider</a> is dedicated mainly to the study of mesons <em>[objects made from a quark of one type, an anti-quark of another type, plus many other particles]</em> that contain <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/">bottom quarks</a> (hence the `b&#8217; in the name).  But it also can be used to study many other things, including mesons containing <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/">charm quarks</a>.</p>
<p>By examining large numbers of mesons that contain a charm quark and an up anti-quark (or a charm anti-quark and an up quark) and studying carefully how they <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/why-do-particles-decay/most-particles-decay-why/">decay</a>, the LHCb experimenters have discovered a new example of violations of <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/c-p-t-and-their-combinations/">the transformations known as CP</a> <em>(C: exchange of particle with anti-particle; P: reflection of the world in a mirror)</em>, of the sort that have been previously seen in mesons containing strange quarks and mesons containing bottom quarks.  Here&#8217;s <a href="https://home.cern/news/press-release/physics/lhcb-sees-new-flavour-matter-antimatter-asymmetry">the press release</a>.</p>
<p>Congratulations to LHCb!  This important addition to our basic knowledge is consistent with expectations; CP violation of roughly this size is predicted by the formulas that make up the Standard Model of Particle Physics.  However, our predictions are very rough in this context; it is sometimes difficult to make accurate calculations <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/protons-and-neutrons/">when the strong nuclear force</a>, which holds mesons (as well as protons and neutrons) together, is involved.  So this is a real coup for LHCb, but not a game-changer for particle physics.  Perhaps, sometime in the future, theorists will learn how to make predictions as precise as LHCb&#8217;s measurement!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A little while back I wrote a <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/02/13/breaking-a-little-new-ground-at-the-large-hadron-collider/">short post</a> about some research that some colleagues and I did using &#8220;open data&#8221; from the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC]. We used data made public by the <a href="https://home.cern/science/experiments/cms">CMS experimental collaboration</a> &#8212; about 1% of their current data &#8212; to search for a new particle, using a couple of twists (as proposed over 10 years ago) on a standard technique.  (CMS is one of the two general-purpose particle detectors at the LHC; the other is called ATLAS.)  We had two motivations: (1) Even if we didn&#8217;t find a new particle, we wanted to prove that our search method was effective; and (2) we wanted to stress-test the CMS Open Data framework, to assure it really does provide all the information needed for a search for something unknown.</p>
<p><a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/02/19/a-broad-search-for-fast-hidden-particles/">Recently I discussed</a> (1), and today I want to address (2): to convey why open data from the LHC is useful but controversial, and why we felt it was important, as theoretical physicists <em>(i.e. people who perform particle physics calculations, but do not build and run the actual experiments)</em>, to do something with it that is usually the purview of experimenters.</p>
<p><strong>The Importance of Archiving Data</strong></p>
<p>In many subfields of physics and astronomy, data from experiments is made public as a matter of routine. Usually this occurs after an substantial delay, to allow the experimenters who collected the data to analyze it first for major discoveries. That&#8217;s as it should be: the experimenters spent years of their lives proposing, building and testing the experiment, and they deserve an uninterrupted opportunity to investigate its data. To force them to release data immediately would create a terrible disincentive for anyone to do all the hard work!</p>
<p>Data from particle physics colliders, however, has not historically been made public. More worrying, it has rarely been archived in a form that is easy for others to use at a later date. I&#8217;m not the right person to tell you the history of this situation, but I can give you a sense for why this still happens today.<span id="more-10236"></span></p>
<p>The fundamental issue is the complexity of data sets from colliders, especially from <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-hadron-as-in-large-hadron-collider/">hadron</a> colliders such as the Tevatron and the LHC. (Archiving was partly done for <a href="https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-electron-positron-collider">LEP</a>, a simpler collider, and was used in later studies including <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1003.0705">this search for unusual Higgs decays</a>  and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06536">this controversial observation,</a> also <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2016/10/21/hiding-from-a-nightmare/">discussed here</a>.) What &#8220;complexity&#8221; are we talking about? Collisions of <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/">protons</a> and/or anti-protons are intrinsically complicated; particles of all sorts go <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/2114779/files/diphoton_v0.png">flying in all directions</a>. The general purpose particle detectors ATLAS and CMS have a complex shape and aren&#8217;t uniform. (Here&#8217;s <a href="https://cms.cern/detector">a cutaway image showing CMS as a set of nested almost-cylinders</a>. Note also that there are inherent weak points: places where cooling tubes have to run, where bundles of wires have to bring signals in and out of the machine, and where segments of the detector join together.) Meanwhile the interactions of the particles with the detector&#8217;s material is messy and often subtle (here&#8217;s <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/2270046/files/Figure_001.png">a significantly oversimplified view</a>). Not every particle is detected, and the probability of missing one depends on where it passes through the detector and what type of particle it is.</p>
<p>Even more important, 99.999% percent of ATLAS and CMS data is discarded as it comes in; only data which passes a set of filters, collectively called <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/the-trigger-discarding-all-but-the-gold/">the &#8220;trigger,&#8221;</a> will even be stored. The trigger is adjusted regularly as experimental conditions change. If you don&#8217;t understand these filters in detail, you can&#8217;t understand the data. Meanwhile the strategies for processing the raw data change over time, becoming more sophisticated, and introducing their own issues that must be known and managed.</p>
<p>I could easily go on (did I mention that at the LHC <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/1479324/files/198609-56-3565522e.png">dozens of collisions occur simultaneously?</a>) If, when you explore the data, you fail to account for all these issues, you can mistake a glitch for a new physical effect, or fail to observe a new physical effect because a glitch obscured it. Any experimentalist inside the collaborations is aware of most of these subtleties, and is surrounded by other experts who will be quick to complain if he or she forgets to account for one of them. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s rare for the experimenters to report a result that has this type of error embedded in it.</p>
<p>Now,<strong><em> imagine writing a handbook that would encapsulate all of that combined knowledge, for use by people who will someday analyze the data without having access to that collective human library.</em></strong> This handbook would accompany an enormous data set taken in changing conditions, and would need to contain everything a person could possibly need to know in order to properly analyze data from an LHC experiment without making a technical error.</p>
<p><strong>Not easy!</strong> But this is what the <a href="http://opendata.cern.ch/">Open Data project at CERN</a>, in which CMS is one of the participating experiments, aims to do. Because it&#8217;s extremely difficult, and therefore expensive in personnel and time, its value has to be clear.</p>
<p>I personally do think the value <strong><em>is</em></strong> clear, especially at the LHC. Until the last couple of decades, one could argue that data from an old particle physics experiment would go out of date so quickly, superseded by better experiments, that it really wasn&#8217;t needed. But this argument has broken down as experiments have become more expensive, with new ones less frequent. There is no guarantee, for instance, that any machine superseding the LHC will be built during my lifetime; it is a minimum of 20 and perhaps 40 years away. In all that time, the LHC&#8217;s data will be the state of the art in proton-proton collider physics, so it ought to be stored so that experts can use it 25 years from now. The price for making that possible has to be paid.</p>
<p><em>[This price was not paid for the Tevatron, whose data, which will remain the gold standard for <strong>proton-antiproton</strong> collisions for perhaps a century or more, is not well-archived.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Was Using Open Data Necessary For Our Project?</strong></p>
<p>Even if we all agree that it&#8217;s important to archive LHC data so that it can be used by future experimental physicists, it&#8217;s not obvious that <strong><em>today&#8217;s theorists</em> </strong>should use it. There&#8217;s an alternative: a theorist with a particular idea can temporarily join one of the experimental collaborations, and carry out the research with like-minded experimental colleagues. In principle, this is a much better way to do things; it permits access to the full data set, it allows the expert experimentalists to handle and manage the data instead of amateurs like us, and it should in principle lead to state-of-the-art results.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t found this approach to work. I&#8217;ve been recommending the use of our technique <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/02/19/a-broad-search-for-fast-hidden-particles/"><em>[selecting events where the transverse momentum of the muon and antimuon pair is large, and often dropping isolation requirements]</em></a> for over ten years, along with several related techniques. These remarks appear in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0712.2041">papers</a>; I&#8217;ve mentioned these issues in <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/94815/contributions/1282671/">many talks</a>, discussed them in detail with at least two dozen experimentalists at ATLAS and CMS (including many colleagues at Harvard), and even started a preliminary project with an experimenter to study them. But everyone had a reason not to proceed. I was told, over and over again, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, we&#8217;ll get to this next year.&#8221; After a decade of this, I came to feel that perhaps it would be best if we carried out the analysis ourselves.</p>
<p>Even then, there was an alternative: we could have just done a study of our method using simulated data, and this would have proved the value of our technique. Why spend the huge amount of time and effort to do a detailed analysis, on a fraction of the real data?</p>
<p>First, I worried that a study on simulated data would be no more effective than all of the talks I gave and all the personal encouraging I did over the previous ten years. I think seeing the study done for real has a lot more impact, because it shows explicitly how effective the technique is and how easily it is implemented. <em>[Gosh, if even theorists can do it&#8230;]</em></p>
<p>Second, one of the things we did in our study is include &#8220;non-isolated muons&#8221; &#8212; muons that have other particles close by &#8212; which are normally not included in theorists&#8217; studies. Dropping the usual isolation criteria may be essential for discoveries of hidden particles, as Kathryn Zurek and I have emphasized since 2006 (and studied in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0712.2041">a paper with Han and Si, in 2007</a>). I felt it was important to show this explicitly in our study. But we needed the real data to do this; simulation of the background sources for non-isolated muons would not have been accurate. <em>[The experimenters rarely use non-isolated muons in the type of analysis we carried out, but notably <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01890">have been doing so here</a>; my impression is that they were unaware of our work from 2007 and came to this approach independently.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Stress Testing the Archive</strong></p>
<p>A further benefit to using the real data was that we stress-tested the archiving procedure in the Open Data project, and to do this fully, we had to carry out our analysis to the very end. The success or failure of our analysis was a test of whether the CMS Open Data framework truly provides all the information needed to do a complete search for something unknown.</p>
<p>The test received a passing grade, with qualifications. Not only we did complete the project, we were able to repeat a rather precise measurement of the (well-known) cross-section for Z boson production, which would have failed if the archive and the accompanying information had been unusable. That said, there is room for improvement: small things were missing, including some calibration information and some simulated data. The biggest issue is perhaps the format for the data storage (difficult to use and unpack for a typical user).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to recognize that the persons in charge of Open Data at CMS have a huge and difficult job; they have to figure out how to write the nearly impossible handbook I referred to above. It&#8217;s therefore crucial that people like our group of theorists actually use the open data sets <em><strong>now</strong></em>, not just after the LHC is over. <em><strong>Now</strong></em>, when the open data sets are still small, is the time to figure out what information is missing, to determine how to improve the data storage, to fill out the documentation and make sure it has no gaps. We hope we&#8217;ve contributed something to that process.</p>
<p><strong>The Future</strong></p>
<p>Should others follow in our footsteps? Yes, I think, though not lightly. In our case, five experts required two years to do the simplest possible study; we could have done it in one year if we&#8217;d been more efficient, but probably not much less. Do not underestimate what this takes, both in terms of understanding the data and learning how to do statistical analysis that most people rarely undertake.</p>
<p>But there are studies that simply cannot be done without real data, and unless you can convince an experimentalist to work with you, your only choice may be to dive in and do your best. And if you are already somewhat informed, but want to learn more about how real experimental analysis is done, so you can appreciate more fully what is typically hidden from view, you will not find a better self-training ground. If you want to take it on, I suggest, as an initial test, that you try to replicate our measurement of the Z boson cross-section. If you can&#8217;t, you&#8217;re not ready for anything else.</p>
<p>I should emphasize that Open Data is a resource that can be used in other ways, and several groups have already done this. In addition to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05842">detailed studies</a> of <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/jets-the-manifestation-of-quarks-and-gluons/">jets</a> carried out on the <em><strong>real</strong></em> data by my collaborators, led by Professor Jesse Thaler, there have been <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11916">studies</a> that have relied solely on the archive of <em><strong>simulated</strong></em> data also provided by the CMS Open Data project. These have value too, in that they offer proving grounds for techniques to be applied later to real data. Since exploratory studies of simulated data don&#8217;t require the extreme care that analysis of real data demands, there may be a lot of potential in this aspect of the Open Data project.</p>
<p>In the end, our research study, like most analyses, is just a drop in the huge bucket of information learned from the LHC. Its details should not obscure the larger question: <em><strong>how shall we, as a community, maintain the LHC data set so that it can continue to provide information across the decades?</strong></em> Maybe the Open Data project is the best approach.  If so, how can we best support it?  And if not, what is the alternative?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few days ago I wrote <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/02/13/breaking-a-little-new-ground-at-the-large-hadron-collider/">a quick summary of a project that we just completed</a> (and you may find it helpful to read that post first). In this project, we looked for new particles at the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">Large Hadron Collider</a> (LHC) in a novel way, in two senses. Today I&#8217;m going to explain what we did, why we did it, and what was unconventional about our search strategy.</p>
<p>The first half of this post will be appropriate for any reader who has been following particle physics as a spectator sport, or in some similar vein. In the second half, I&#8217;ll add some comments for my expert colleagues that may be useful in understanding and appreciating some of our results.  <em>[If you just want to read the comments for experts, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/02/19/a-broad-search-for-fast-hidden-particles/#experts">jump here</a>.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Why did we do this?</strong></p>
<p>Motivation first. Why, as theorists, would we attempt to take on the role of our experimental colleagues &#8212; to try on our own to analyze the extremely complex and challenging data from the LHC? We&#8217;re by no means experts in data analysis, and we were very slow at it. And on top of that, we only had access to 1% of the data that CMS has collected. Isn&#8217;t it obvious that there is no chance whatsoever of finding something new with just 1% of the data, since the experimenters have had years to look through much larger data sets?<span id="more-10224"></span></p>
<p>Not only isn&#8217;t it obvious, it&#8217;s <strong>false</strong>. In an immense data set, unexpected phenomena can hide, and if you ask the wrong questions, they may not reveal themselves. This has happened before, and it will happen again.</p>
<p>Conventional thinking, before the LHC and still today, is that new phenomena will likely appear in the form of particles with large rest masses. The logic? You <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/naturalness/">can&#8217;t easily explain</a> the patterns of particles in the Standard Model without adding some new, slightly heavier ones.  Crudely speaking, this would lead you to look for particles with the largest rest masses you can reach, which is limited by the energy of your machine, because of E=mc². That&#8217;s why the LHC was expected to find more than just the Higgs particle, and why the machine proposed for the post-LHC era at CERN is a larger copy of the LHC, with more energy in each collision.</p>
<p>This point of view is based on strong, reasonable arguments; please don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m criticizing it as foolish. But there have long been cracks in those arguments. Studies of so-called &#8220;gauge-mediated&#8221; supersymmetry breaking in the mid 1990s, which revealed a vast world of previously ignored phenomena. The discovery of the cosmological constant in 1998, which clearly violated conventional reasoning. The possibilities of relatively large unobserved dimensions of space (which we, like blind flies stuck between panes of glass, can&#8217;t detect), which showed how little confidence we should have in what we think we know. The model known as the Twin Higgs in 2005, which showed how the new heavy particles might exist, but could hide from the LHC.</p>
<p>In this context, it should not have been a total shock &#8212; just a painful one &#8212; that so far the LHC has not <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-discovery-of-the-higgs/">found anything other than a Higgs boson</a>, using conventional searches.</p>
<p>Indeed, the whole story of my 30-year career has been watching the conventional reasoning gradually break down. I cannot explain why some of my colleagues were so confident in it, but I hope their depression medication is working well. I myself view the evisceration of conventional wisdom as potentially very exciting, as well as very challenging.</p>
<p>And if you&#8217;re a bit unconventional, you might wonder whether particles that are insensitive to all the known forces (except gravity) might have an unexpected role to play in explaining the mysteries of particle physics. Importantly, <em><strong>these (and only these) types of particles could have arbitrarily low rest mass and yet have escaped discovery up to now.<br />
</strong></em></p>
<p>This unconventional thinking has made some headway into the LHC community, and there have been quite a number of searches for these &#8220;hidden&#8221; particles. <strong>BUT</strong>&#8230; not nearly enough of them.  The problem is that (a) such particles might be produced in any of a hundred different ways, and (b) they might disintegrate (&#8220;<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/why-do-particles-decay/most-particles-decay-why/">decay</a>&#8221;) in any of a hundred different ways, meaning that there are many thousands of different ways they might show up in our experiments. Don&#8217;t quote me on the numbers here; they&#8217;re for effect. The point is that there&#8217;s a lot of work to do if we&#8217;re going to be sure that we did a thorough search for hidden particles. And one thing I can assure you: this work has not yet been done.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the number of searches required is a lot smaller than thousands&#8230; but still large: dozens, probably. The simplest one of them &#8212; one that even theorists could do, and barely qualifying as &#8220;unconventional&#8221; &#8212; is to look for a hidden particle that (1) decays sometimes to a muon/anti-muon pair, and (2) is initially produced with a hard kick&#8230; like shrapnel from an explosion. In colloquial terms, we might say that it&#8217;s faster than typical, perhaps very close to the speed of light. In Physicese, it has substantial <em><strong>momentum</strong> [and at the LHC we have to look for momentum perpendicular (&#8220;transverse&#8221;) to the proton beams.]<br />
</em></p>
<p>There&#8217;s an obvious way to look for fast hidden particles, and it requires only one simple step beyond the conventional. And if you take that step, you have a much better chance of success than if you take the conventional route&#8230; so much better than in some cases you might find something, even with 1% of the data, that nobody had yet noticed. And even if you find nothing, you might convince the experts that this is an excellent approach, worth applying on the big data sets.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s <em><strong>why</strong></em> we did it. Now a few more details.</p>
<p><strong>What we did</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing new about looking for new particles that sometimes decay to muon/anti-muon pairs; several particles have been discovered this way, including the Z boson and the Upsilon (a mini-atom made from a bottom quark/anti-quark pair.) It&#8217;s not even particularly unconventional to look for that pair to carry a lot of transverse momentum. But to use these as the<strong><em> only</em></strong> requirements in a search &#8212; this is a bit unconventional, and to my knowledge has not been done before.</p>
<p>Why add this unconventional element in the first place? Because, as Kathryn Zurek and I emphasized long ago, the best way to discover low-mass hidden particles is often to look for them in the decay of a heavier particle; it may be the most common way they are produced, and even if it isn&#8217;t, it&#8217;s often the most spectacular production mechanism, and thus the easiest to detect. Indeed, when a particle is produced in the decay of another, it often acts like shrapnel &#8212; it goes flying.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s hard to detect such a particle (let&#8217;s call it &#8220;V&#8221;, because of the shape the muon and anti-muon make in the picture below) if it decays before it has moved appreciably from the location where it was created. In that case, your only clue of its existence is <strong><em>the shrapnel&#8217;s shrapnel</em></strong>: the muon and anti-muon that appear when the V itself decays. And by itself, that&#8217;s not enough information. Many of the proton-proton collisions at the LHC make a muon and anti-muon pair for a variety of random reasons. How, then, can one find evidence for the V, if its muon/anti-muon pair look just like other random processes that happen all the time?</p>

<p>One key trick is that the new particle&#8217;s muon/anti-muon pair isn&#8217;t random: the energies and momenta of the muon and anti-muon always have a very special relationship, characteristic of the rest mass of the V particle. <em>[Specifically: the &#8220;<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-invariant-mass/">invariant mass</a>&#8221; of the muon/anti-muon pair equals the V rest mass.]</em> And so, we use the fact that this special relationship rarely holds for the random background, but it always holds for the signal.  We don&#8217;t know the V mass, but we do know that the signal itself always reflects it.</p>
<p>The problem (both qualitatively and quantitatively) is much like trying to hear someone singing on your car radio while stuck in a deafening city traffic jam. As long as the note being sung is loud and clear enough, and the noise isn&#8217;t too insane, it&#8217;s possible.</p>
<p>But what if it&#8217;s not? Well, you might try some additional tricks. Noise reduction headphones, for example, would potentially cancel some of the traffic sound, making the song easier to hear. And that&#8217;s a vague analogy to what we are doing when we require the muon and anti-muon be from a fast particle. Most of the random processes that make muon/anti-muon pairs make a <em>slow pair</em>. [The individual muon and anti-muon move quickly, but together they look as though they came from something slow.] By removing those muon/anti-muon pairs that are slow, in this sense, we remove much of the random &#8220;background&#8221; while leaving much of the signal from any new particle of the sort we&#8217;re looking for.</p>
<p>Searches for particles like V have come mainly in two classes. Either (1) no noise-cancelling tricks are applied, and one just tries to cope with the full set of random muon/anti-muon pairs, or (2) a precise signal is sought in a highly targeted matter, and every trick one can think of is applied. Approach (1), extremely broad but shallow, has the advantage of being very simple, but the disadvantage that what you&#8217;re looking for might be lost in the noise. Approach (2), deep but narrow, has the advantage of being extremely powerful for the targeted signal, but the disadvantage that many other interesting signals are removed by one or another of the too-clever tricks.  So if you use the approach (2), you may need a different search strategy for each target.</p>
<p>Our approach tries to maintain tremendous breadth while adding some more depth. And the reason this is possible is that the trick of requiring substantial momentum can reduce the size of the background &#8220;noise&#8221; by factors of 5, 25, 100 &#8212; depending on how much momentum one demands. These are big factors! <em>[Which is important, because when you reduce background by 100, you usually only gain sensitivity to your signal by 10.]</em> So imposing this sort of requirement can make it somewhat easier to find signals from fast hidden particles.</p>
<p>Using this approach, we were able to search for fast hidden short-lived particles and exclude them <em><strong>without exception</strong></em> across a wide range of masses and down to smaller production rates than anyone has in the past. The precise bounds still need to be worked out in particular cases, but it&#8217;s clear that while, as expected, we do less well than targeted searches for particular signals, we often do 2 to 10 times better than a conventional broad search. And that benefit of our method over the conventional approach should apply also to ATLAS and CMS when they search in their full data sets.</p>

<strong>Some Additional Technical Remarks for our Experimental Colleagues:</strong></p>
<p>Now, for my expert colleagues, some comments about our results and where one can take them next. I&#8217;ll reserve most of my thoughts on our use of open data, and why open data is valuable, for my next post&#8230; with one exception.</p>
<p><strong>Isolation Or Not</strong></p>
<p>Open data plays a central role in our analysis at the point where we drop the muon isolation criterion and replace it with something else.  We considered two ways of reducing QCD background (muons from heavy quark decays and fake muons);</p>
<ul>
<li>the usual one, requiring the muons and anti-muons be isolated from other particles,</li>
<li>dropping the isolation criterion on muons altogether, and replacing it with a cut on the promptness of the muon (i.e. on the impact parameter).</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>With real data to look at, we were able to establish that by tightening the promptness requirement alone, one can reduce QCD until it is comparable to the Drell-Yan background, with minimal loss of signal.</strong></em> And that means a price of no more than √2 in sensitivity. So if chasing a potential signal whose muons are isolated &lt; 85% of the time (i.e. a dimuon isolation efficiency &lt; 70%) one may be better off dropping the isolation criterion and replacing it with a promptness criterion. [Of course there&#8217;s a great deal of in-between, such as demanding one fully isolated lepton and imposing promptness and loose isolation on the other.]</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to think of reasonable signals where each muon is isolated less than 85% of the time; indeed, as Kathryn Zurek and I emphasized back in 2006, a feature of many relevant hidden sector models (&#8220;hidden valleys&#8221; or &#8220;dark sectors&#8221;, as they are often known) is that particles emerge in clusters, creating non-standard jets. So it is quite common, in such theories, that the isolation criterion should be dropped (see for example <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0712.2041">this study from 2007</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>Our Limits</strong></p>
<p>Our main results are model-independent limits on the product of the cross-section for V production, the probability for V to decay to muons, and the acceptance and efficiency for the production of V.  To apply our limits, these quantities must be computed within a particular signal model. We&#8217;ve been working so hard to iron out our results that we really haven&#8217;t had time yet to look carefully at their detailed implications. But there are a few things already worth noting.</p>
<p>We briefly compared our model-independent results to targeted analyses by ATLAS and CMS for a simple model: Higgs decaying to two pseudoscalars <em><strong>a</strong></em>, one of which decays to a bottom quark/anti-quark pair and one to a muon/anti-muon pair. (More generally we considered <em>h<strong>→</strong></em>V<em><strong>a</strong></em> where V, decaying to muons, may have a different mass from <strong><em>a</em></strong>). If the V and <em><strong>a</strong></em> mass are both 40 GeV, our limits lag the targeted limits by a factor of 15-20.  But the targeted limits used 10-20 times as much data as we had.  One may then estimate that <strong><em>with identical data sets</em></strong>, the difference between our approach and theirs would likely be somewhere between 5 and 10.</p>
<p>Conversely, there are many models to which the targeted limits don&#8217;t apply; if <em><strong>a</strong></em> usually decays to gluons, or the <em><strong>a</strong></em> mass is so low that its decay products merge, we still set the same limit, while the published experimental analyses, which require two b-tagged jets, do not.</p>
<p>Thus broad analyses and deep analyses are complementary, and both are needed.</p>
<p><strong>The wiggle at 29.5 GeV and what to do about it</strong></p>
<p>In our limit plots, we have a few excesses, as one would expect with such a detailed mass scan. The only interesting excess (which is not the most significant) is found in a sample with no isolation criterion and a cut of 25 GeV on the dimuon pair &#8212; and what makes it interesting is that it is at 29.5 GeV (and locally 2.7σ) which is quite near to a couple of other curious excesses (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06536">from ALEPH data</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01890">by CMS</a>) that we&#8217;ve heard about in the last couple of years.  Probably it&#8217;s nothing, but just in case, let me say a few cautious words about it.</p>

<p>So let&#8217;s imagine there were a new particle (I&#8217;ll keep calling it V) with mass of about 29 GeV.  What would we already know about it?</p>
<p>The excess we see at 29.5 GeV does not appear in the isolated sample, which overlaps the prompt sample but is half its size (see the figure above left), and it&#8217;s not visible with a transverse momentum cut of 60 GeV.  That means it could only be consistent with a signal with transverse momentum in the 25-50 GeV range, and with often-non-isolated leptons.</p>
<p>If it is produced with bottom (<em>b</em>) quarks all of the time, then there&#8217;s no question that CMS&#8217;s studies, which require a <em>b</em>-tagged jet, are much more sensitive than we are, and there&#8217;s no chance, if they have only a ~3σ excess, that we would see any hint of it.</p>
<p><em><strong>But if instead V is usually produced with <span style="color:#ff0000;">no</span> b quarks, then the CMS analysis could be missing most of the events.</strong> </em>We, in our model-independent analysis, would miss far fewer. And in that context, it&#8217;s possible we would see a hint in our analysis at the same time CMS sees a hint in theirs, despite having much less data available.</p>
<p>Moreover, since the muons must often be non-isolated (and as mentioned above, there are many models where this happens naturally) other searches that require isolated leptons (e.g. multilepton searches) might have less sensitivity than one might initially assume.</p>
<p>Were this true, then applying our analysis <em>[with little or no isolation requirement, and a promptness cut]</em> to the full Run II data set would immediately reveal this particle. Both ATLAS or CMS would see it easily.   So this is not a question we need to debate or discuss. There&#8217;s plenty of data; we just need to see the results of our methodology applied to it.</p>
<p>It would hardly be surprising if someone has looked already, in the past or present, by accident or by design.  Nevertheless, there will be considerable interest in seeing a public result.</p>
<p><strong>Looking Beyond This Analysis</strong></p>
<p>First, a few obvious points:</p>
<ul>
<li>We only used muons, but one could add electrons; for a spin-one V, this would help.</li>
<li>Our methods would also work for photon pairs (for which there&#8217;s more experience because of the Higgs, though not at low mass) as appropriate for spin-0 and spin-2 parent particles.</li>
<li>Although we applied our approach below the Z peak and above the upsilon, there&#8217;s no reason not to extend it above or below. We refrained only because we had too little data above the Z peak to do proper fits, and below the Upsilon the muons were so collimated that our results would have been affected by the losses in the dimuon trigger efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<p>More generally, the device of reducing backgrounds through a transverse momentum cut (or a transverse boost cut) is only one of several methods that are motivated by hidden sector models. As I have emphasized in many talks, <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/94815/contributions/1282671/">for instance here</a>, others include:</p>
<p>1) <strong>cutting on the number of jets</strong> [each additional jet reduces background by a factor of several, depending on the jet pt cut]. This works because Drell-Yan and even dileptonic top have few jets on average, and it works on QCD to a lesser extent. It is sensitive to models where the V is produced by a heavy particle (or particle pair) that typically produces many jets. Isolation is often reduced in this case, so a loose isolation criterion (or none) may be necessary. Of course one could also impose a cut on the <strong>number of b tags.</strong></p>
<p>2) <strong>cutting on the total transverse energy in the event</strong>, often called S_T. This works because in Drell-Yan, S_T is usually of the same order as the dimuon mass. It (probably) doesn&#8217;t remove much QCD unless the isolation criterion is applied, and there will still be plenty of top background. It&#8217;s best for models where the V is produced by a heavy particle (or particle pair) but the V momentum is often not high, the number of jets is rather small, and the events are rare.</p>
<p>3) <strong>cutting on the missing transverse energy in the event</strong>, which works because it&#8217;s small in Drell-Yan and QCD. This of course is done in many supersymmetry studies and elsewhere, but no model-independent limits on V production has been shown publicly.  This is a powerful probe of models where some hidden particles are very long-lived, or often decay invisibly.</p>
<p>All of these approaches can be applied to muon pairs, electron pairs, photon pairs &#8212; even tau pairs and bottom-jet pairs, for that matter.  Each of them can provide an advantage in reducing backgrounds and allowing more powerful model-independent searches for resonances. And in each case, there are signals that might have been missed in other analyses that could show up first in these searches.  More theoretical and experimental studies are needed, but in my opinion, many of these searches need to be done on Run II data before there can be any confidence that the floor has been swept clean.</p>
<p>[There is at least one more subtle example: <strong>cutting on the number of tracks</strong>. Talk to me about the relevant signals if you&#8217;re curious.]</p>
<p>Of course, <strong>multi-lepton searches</strong> are a powerful tool for finding V as well. All you need is one stray lepton &#8212; and then you plot the dimuon (or dielectron) mass. Unfortunately <em><strong>we rarely see limits on V + lepton as a function of the V mass, but it would be great if they were made available</strong></em>, because they would put much stronger constraints on relevant models than one can obtain by mere counting of 3-lepton events.</p>
<p><strong>A subtlety: The question of how to place cuts</strong></p>
<p>A last point for the diehards: one of the decisions that searches of this type require is where exactly to make the cuts &#8212; or alternatively, how to bin the data? Should our first cut on the transverse momentum be at 25 or 35 GeV? and having made this choice, where should the next cut be? Without a principle, this choice introduces significant arbitrariness into the search strategy, with associated problems.</p>
<p>This question is itself crude, and surely there are more sophisticated statistical methods for approaching the issue. There is also the question of whether to bin rather than cut. But I did want to point out that we proposed an answer, in the form of a rough principle, which one might call a &#8220;2-5&#8221; rule, illustrated in the figure below. The idea is that a signal at the 2 sigma level at one cut should be seen at the 5 sigma level after the next, stricter cut is applied; this requires each cut successively reduce the background by roughly a factor of (5/2)².  Implicitly, in this calculation we assume the stricter cut removes no signal. That assumption is less silly than it sounds, because the signals to which we are sensitive often have a characteristic momentum scale, and cuts below that characteristic scale have slowly varying acceptance.  We showed some examples of this in section V of our paper.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, a small but intrepid band of theoretical particle physicists (professor Jesse Thaler of MIT, postdocs Yotam Soreq and Wei Xue of CERN, Harvard Ph.D. student Cari Cesarotti, and myself) put out <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04222">a paper</a> that is unconventional in two senses. First, we looked for new particles at the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">Large Hadron Collider</a> in a way that hasn&#8217;t been done before, at least in public. And second, we looked for new particles at the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">Large Hadron Collider</a> in a way that hasn&#8217;t been done before, at least in public.</p>
<p>And no, there&#8217;s no error in the previous paragraph.</p>
<p>1) We used a small amount of <strong>actual data from the <a href="https://home.cern/science/experiments/cms">CMS experiment</a></strong>, even though we&#8217;re not ourselves members of the CMS experiment, to do a search for a new particle. Both ATLAS and CMS, the two large multipurpose experimental detectors at the Large Hadron Collider [LHC], have made a small fraction of their proton-proton collision data public, through a website called the <a href="http://opendata.cern.ch/">CERN Open Data Portal</a>. Some experts, including my co-authors Thaler, Xue and their colleagues, have used this data (and the simulations that accompany it) to do a variety of important studies involving known particles and their properties. [Here&#8217;s <a href="http://cylindricalonion.web.cern.ch/blog/201712/future-particle-physics-open">a blog post by Thaler concerning Open Data and its importance from his perspective.</a>] But our new study is the first to <strong><em>look for signs of a new particle in this public data</em></strong>. While our chances of finding anything were low, we had a larger goal: to see whether Open Data could be used for such searches. We hope our paper provides some evidence that Open Data offers a reasonable path for preserving priceless LHC data, allowing it to be used as an archive by physicists of the post-LHC era.</p>
<p>2) Since only had a tiny fraction of CMS&#8217;s data was available to us, about 1% by some count, how could we have done anything useful compared to what the LHC experts have already done? Well, that&#8217;s why we examined the data in a slightly unconventional way (one of <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/94815/contributions/1282671/">several methods that I&#8217;ve advocated for many years</a>, but has not been used in any public study). Consequently it allowed us to explore some ground that no one had yet swept clean, and even have a tiny chance of an actual discovery! But the larger scientific goal, absent a discovery, was <strong>to prove the value of this unconventional strategy</strong>, in hopes that the experts at CMS and ATLAS will use it (and others like it) in future. Their chance of discovering something new, using their full data set, is vastly greater than ours ever was.</p>
<p>Now don&#8217;t all go rushing off to download and analyze terabytes of CMS Open Data; you&#8217;d better know what you&#8217;re getting into first. It&#8217;s worthwhile, but it&#8217;s not easy going. LHC data is extremely complicated, and until this project I&#8217;ve always been skeptical that it could be released in a form that anyone outside the experimental collaborations could use. Downloading the data and turning it into a manageable form is itself a major task. Then, while studying it, there are an enormous number of mistakes that you can make (and we made quite a few of them) and you&#8217;d better know how to make lots of cross-checks to find your mistakes (which, fortunately, we did know; we hope we found all of them!) The CMS personnel in charge of the Open Data project were enormously helpful to us, and we&#8217;re very grateful to them; but since the project is new, there were inevitable wrinkles which had to be worked around. And you&#8217;d better have some friends among the experimentalists who can give you advice when you get stuck, or point out aspects of your results that don&#8217;t look quite right. [Our thanks to them!]</p>
<p>All in all, this project took us two years! Well, honestly, it should have taken half that time &#8212; but it couldn&#8217;t have taken much less than that, with all we had to learn. So trying to use Open Data from an LHC experiment is not something you do in your idle free time.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I feel it was worth it. At a personal level, I learned a great deal more about how experimental analyses are carried out at CMS, and by extension, at the LHC more generally. And more importantly, we were able to show what we&#8217;d hoped to show: that <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em><strong>there are still tremendous opportunities for discovery at the LHC</strong></em></span>, through the use of (even slightly) unconventional model-independent analyses. It&#8217;s a big world to explore, and we took only a small step in the easiest direction, but perhaps our efforts will encourage others to take bigger and more challenging ones.</p>
<p>For those readers with greater interest in our work, I&#8217;ll put out more details in two blog posts over the next few days: one about what we looked for and how, and one about our views regarding the value of open data from the LHC, not only for our project but for the field of particle physics as a whole.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>UPDATE 10/26: In the original version of this post, I stupidly forgot to include an effect, causing an error of a factor of about 5 in one of my estimates below. I had originally suggested that a recent result using ALEPH data was probably more powerful than a recent CMS result.  But once the error is corrected, the two experiments appear have comparable sensitivity. However, I was very conservative in my analysis of ALEPH, and my guess concerning CMS has a big uncertainty band &#8212; so it might go either way.  It&#8217;s up to ALEPH experts and CMS experts to show us who really wins the day.  Added reasoning and discussion marked in green below.</strong></span></p>
<p>In <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2016/10/21/hiding-from-a-nightmare/">Friday&#8217;s post</a>, I highlighted the importance of looking for low-mass particles whose interactions with known particles are very weak. I referred to a recent preprint in which an experimental physicist, Dr. Arno Heister, reanalyzed ALEPH data in such a search.</p>
<p>A few hours later, Harvard Professor Matt Reece pointed me to a paper that appeared <strong>just two weeks ago:</strong> a very interesting <a href="http://cms-results.web.cern.ch/cms-results/public-results/preliminary-results/HIG-15-009/index.html">CMS analysis of 2011-2012 data that did a search of this type</a> &#8212; although it appears that CMS <em>[one of the two general purpose detectors at the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">Large Hadron Collider</a> (LHC)]</em> didn&#8217;t think of it that way.</p>
<p>The title of the paper is obscure:  &#8220;<em>Search for a light pseudo–scalar Higgs boson produced in association with bottom quarks in pp collisions at 8 TeV</em>&#8220;.  Such spin-zero &#8220;pseudo-scalar&#8221; particles, which often arise in speculative models with more than one Higgs particle, usually decay to bottom quark/anti-quark pairs or tau/anti-tau pairs.  But they can have a <strong>very rare</strong> decay to muon/anti-muon, which is much easier to measure. The title of the paper gives no indication that the muon/anti-muon channel is the target of the search; you have to read the abstract. Shouldn&#8217;t the words &#8220;in the dimuon channel&#8221; or &#8220;dimuon resonance&#8221; appear in the title?  That would help researchers who are interested in dimuons, but not in pseudo-scalars, find the paper.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the main result of the paper:</p>
<p><a href="http://cms-results.web.cern.ch/cms-results/public-results/preliminary-results/HIG-15-009/CMS-PAS-HIG-15-009_Figure_005.png"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/cms-results.web.cern.ch/cms-results/public-results/preliminary-results/HIG-15-009/CMS-PAS-HIG-15-009_Figure_005.png" style="max-width:100%;" /></a></p>
<p>At left is shown a plot of the number of events as a function of the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-invariant-mass/">invariant mass</a> of the muon/anti-muon pairs.  CMS data is in black dots; estimated background is shown in the upper curve (with top quark backgrounds in the lower curve); and the peak at bottom shows what a simulated particle decaying to muon/anti-muon with a mass of 30 GeV/c² would look like. (Imagine sticking the peak on top of the upper curve to see how a signal would affect the data points).  At right are the resulting limits on the rate for such a resonance to be produced and then decay to muon/anti-muon, <em><strong>if it is radiated off of a bottom quark. [</strong></em><em>A limit of 100 femtobarns means that at most two thousand collisions of this type could have occurred during the year 2012.  But note that only about 1 in 100 of these collisions would have been observed, due to the difficulty of <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/the-trigger-discarding-all-but-the-gold/">triggering on these collisions</a> and some other challenges.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Note also the restriction of the mass of the dimuon pair to the range 25 GeV to 60 GeV. This may have done purely been for technical reasons, but if it was due to the theoretical assumptions, that restriction should be lifted.]</em></p>
<p>While this plot places moderate limits on <strong>spin-zero</strong> particles produced with a bottom quark, it&#8217;s equally interesting, at least to me, in other contexts. Specifically, it puts limits on any light <strong>spin-one</strong> particle (call it V) that mixes (either via kinetic or mass mixing) with the photon and Z and often comes along with at least one bottom quark&#8230; because <strong>for such particles the rate to decay to muons is <span style="color:#ff0000;">not</span> rare</strong>.  This is very interesting for hidden valley models specifically; as I mentioned on Friday, new spin-one and spin-zero particles often are produced together, giving a muon/anti-muon pair along with one or more bottom quark/anti-quark pairs.</p>
<p>But CMS interpreted its measurement only in terms of <strong><em>radiation of a new particle off a bottom quar</em>k</strong>.  Now, what if a V particle decaying sometimes to muon/anti-muon were produced in a <strong>Z particle decay</strong> <span style="color:#999999;"><em>(a possibility alluded to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0604261">already in 2006</a>).</em></span>  For a different production process, the angles and energies of the particles would be different, and since many events would be lost (due to triggering, transverse momentum cuts, and b-tagging inefficiencies at low transverse momentum) the limits would have to be fully recalculated by the experimenters.  It would be great if CMS could add such an analysis before they publish this paper.</p>
<p>Still, we can make a rough back-of-the-envelope estimate, with big caveats. The LHC produced about 600 million Z particles at CMS in 2012. The plot at right tells us that if the V were radiated off a bottom quark, the maximum number of produced V&#8217;s decaying to muons would be about 2000 to 8000, depending on the V mass.  Now if we could take those numbers directly, we&#8217;d conclude that the fraction of Z&#8217;s that could decay to muon/anti-muon plus bottom quarks in this way would be 3 to 12 per million. But sensitivity of this search to a Z decay to V is probably much less than for a V radiated off bottom quarks <em>[because (depending on the V mass) either the bottom quarks in the Z decay would be less energetic and more difficult to tag, or the muons are less energetic on average, or both.]</em> So I&#8217;m guessing that the limits on Z decays to V are always worse than one per hundred thousand, for any V mass.  <em>(Thanks to Wei Xue for catching an error as I was finalizing my estimate.)  </em></p>
<p>If that guess/estimate is correct, then the CMS search <strong>does not</strong> rule out the possibility of a hundred or so Z decays to V particles at each of the various LEP experiments.  That said, old LEP searches might rule this possibility out; if anyone knows of such a search, please comment or contact me.</p>
<p>As for whether Heister&#8217;s analysis of the ALEPH experiment&#8217;s data shows signs of such a signal, I think it unlikely (though some people seemed to read my post as saying the opposite.)  <strong>As I pointed out in Friday&#8217;s post</strong>, not only is the excess too small for excitement on its own, it also is somewhat too wide and its angular correlations look like the background <em>(which comes, of course, from bottom quarks that decay to charm quarks plus a muon and neutrino.)</em>  The point of Friday&#8217;s post, and of today&#8217;s, is that <strong>we should be looking</strong>.</p>
<p>In fact, because of Heister&#8217;s work <em>(which, by the way, is his own, not endorsed by the ALEPH collaboration)</em>, we can draw interesting if rough conclusions.  Ignore for now the bump at 30 GeV/c²; that&#8217;s more controversial.  What about the <strong>absence</strong> of a bump between 35 and 50 GeV/c²? Unless there are subtleties with his analysis that I don&#8217;t understand, we learn that at ALEPH there were fewer than ten Z decays to a V particle (plus a source of bottom quarks) for V in this mass range.  <del>That limits such Z decays to about 2 to 3 per million.</del>  <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>OOPS: Dumb mistake!! At this step, I forgot to include the fact that requiring bottom quarks in the ALEPH events only works about 20% of the time <em>(thanks to Imperial College Professor Oliver Buchmuller for questioning my reasoning!)</em> The real number is therefore about 5 times larger, more like 10 to 15 per million.</strong></span> If that rough estimate is correct, it would provide a <del>more powerful constraint than</del> <span style="color:#008000;">constraint roughly comparable to</span> the current CMS analysis.</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;"><em>[[BUT: In my original argument I was very conservative.  When I said &#8220;fewer than 10&#8221;, I was trying to be brief; really, looking at the invariant mass plot, the allowed numbers of excess events for a V with mass above 36 GeV is typically fewer than 7 or even 5.  And that doesn&#8217;t include any angular information, which for many signals would reduce the numbers to 3.   Including these effects properly brings the ALEPH bound back down to something close to my initial estimate.  Anyway, it&#8217;s clear that CMS is nipping at ALEPH&#8217;s heels, but I&#8217;m still betting they haven&#8217;t passed ALEPH &#8212; yet.]]</em></span></p>
<p>So my advice would be to set Heister&#8217;s bump aside and instead <strong>focus on the constraints that one can obtain, and the potential discoveries that one <span style="color:#ff0000;">could</span> make, with this type of analysis, either at LEP or at LHC.</strong> That&#8217;s where I think the real lesson lies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This summer there was a blog post from <span class="fn"><a class="g-profile" title="author profile" href="https://plus.google.com/111136225362929878171" rel="author">Sabine Hossenfelder</a></span>  claiming that &#8220;<a href="http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2016/08/the-lhc-nightmare-scenario-has-come-true.html">The LHC `nightmare scenario&#8217; has come true</a>&#8221; &#8212; implying that the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC] has found nothing but a <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/">Standard Model Higgs particle</a> (the simplest possible type), and will find nothing more of great importance. With all due respect for the considerable intelligence and technical ability of the author of that post, I could not disagree more; not only are we not in a nightmare, it isn&#8217;t even night-time yet, and hardly time for sleep or even daydreaming. There&#8217;s a tremendous amount of work to do, and there may be many hidden discoveries yet to be made, lurking in existing LHC data.  Or elsewhere.</p>
<p>I can defend this claim (and have done so as recently as this month; here are <a href="https://indico.bnl.gov/getFile.py/access?contribId=19&amp;sessionId=6&amp;resId=0&amp;materialId=slides&amp;confId=1516">my slides</a>). But there&#8217;s evidence from another quarter that it is far too early for such pessimism.  It has appeared in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06536">a new paper</a> (a preprint, so not yet peer-reviewed) by an experimentalist named Arno Heister, who is evaluating 20-year old data from the experiment known as <a href="https://home.cern/about/experiments/aleph">ALEPH</a>.</p>
<p>In the early 1990s the Large Electron-Positron (LEP) collider at CERN, in the same tunnel that now houses the LHC, produced nearly 4 million Z particles at the center of ALEPH; the Z&#8217;s decayed immediately into other particles, and ALEPH was used to observe those decays.  Of course the data was studied in great detail, and you might think there couldn&#8217;t possibly be anything still left to find in that data, after over 20 years. But a hidden gem wouldn&#8217;t surprise those of us who have worked in this subject for a long time &#8212; especially those of us who have worked on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0604261">hidden valleys</a>. <em>(Hidden Valleys are theories with a set of new forces and low-mass particles, which, because they aren&#8217;t affected by the known forces excepting gravity, interact very weakly with the known particles.  They are also often called &#8220;dark sectors&#8221; if they have something to do with dark matter.)</em></p>
<p>For some reason most experimenters in particle physics don&#8217;t tend to look for things just because they can; they stick to signals that theorists have already predicted. Since hidden valleys only hit the market in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0604261">a 2006 paper I wrote with then-student Kathryn Zurek</a>, long after the experimenters at ALEPH had moved on to other experiments, nobody went back to look in ALEPH or other LEP data for hidden valley phenomena (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1003.0705">with one exception</a>.) I didn&#8217;t expect anyone to ever do so; it&#8217;s a lot of work to dig up and recommission old computer files.</p>
<p>This wouldn&#8217;t have been a problem if the big LHC experiments (ATLAS, CMS and LHCb) had looked extensively for the sorts of particles expected in hidden valleys. ATLAS and CMS especially have many advantages; for instance, the LHC has made over a hundred times more Z particles than LEP ever did. But despite specific proposals for what to look for (and <a href="http://indico.cern.ch/event/46250/">a decade of pleading</a>), only a few limited searches have been carried out, mostly for very long-lived particles, for particles with mass of a few GeV/c² or less, and for particles produced in unexpected Higgs decays. And that means that, yes, hidden physics could certainly still be found in old ALEPH data, and in other old experiments. Kudos to Dr. Heister for taking a look.<span id="more-8706"></span></p>
<p>Now, has he actually <strong>found</strong> something hidden at ALEPH? It&#8217;s far too early to say. Dr. Heister is careful not to make a strong claim: his paper refers to an observed excess, not to the discovery of or even evidence for anything. But his analysis can be interpreted as showing a hint of a new particle (let&#8217;s call it the <strong>V particle</strong>, just to have a name for it) decaying sometimes to a muon and an anti-muon, and probably also sometimes to an electron and an anti-electron, with a rest mass about 1/3 of that of the Z particle &#8212; about 30 <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/">GeV</a>/c². Here&#8217;s one of the plots from his paper, showing the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-invariant-mass/">invariant mass</a> of the muon and anti-muon in Z decays that also have evidence of a bottom quark and a bottom anti-quark (each one giving a <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/jets-the-manifestation-of-quarks-and-gluons/">jet of hadrons</a> that has been &#8220;<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/jets-the-manifestation-of-quarks-and-gluons/b-tagging-identifying-jets-from-bottom-quarks/">b-tagged</a>&#8221;).  There&#8217;s an excess at about 30 GeV.</p>

<p>The simplest physical effect that would produce such a bump is a new particle; indeed this is how the Z particle itself was identified, over three decades ago.</p>
<p>However, the statistical significance of the bump is still only (after <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/08/28/nature-is-full-of-surprises/">look-elsewhere effect</a>) at most 3 standard deviations, according to the paper. So this bump could just be a fluke; we&#8217;ve seen similar ones disappear with more data, for example <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/04/20/dark-matter-now-you-see-it-now-you-dont/">this one</a>. There are also a couple of serious issues that will give experts pause <em>(the width of the bump is surprisingly large; the angular correlations seem consistent with background rather than a new signal; etc.)</em> So the data itself is not enough to convince anyone, including Dr. Heister, though it is certainly interesting.</p>
<p>Conversely it is intriguing that the bump in the plot above is observed in events with bottom quarks. It is common for hidden valleys <em>(including everything from a simple abelian Higgs models to more complex confining models)</em> to contain</p>
<ul>
<li>at least one spin-one particle V (which can decay to muon/anti-muon or electron/positron) and</li>
<li>at least one spin-zero particle S (which can decay to bottom/anti-bottom preferentially, with occasional decays to tau/anti-tau.)</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, in such models, a rare decay such as Z  ⇒ V + S, producing a muon/anti-muon pair plus two bottom quark/anti-quark <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/jets-the-manifestation-of-quarks-and-gluons/">jets</a>, would often be a possibility.*</p>
<p>*<span style="color:#808080;"><em>[In this case the bottom and anti-bottom jets would themselves show a peak in their invariant mass, but unfortunately their distribution in the presence of a candidate V was not shown. One other obvious prediction of such a model is a handful of striking Z ⇒ V + S ⇒ muon/anti-muon + tau/anti-tau events; but the expected number is very small and somewhat model-dependent.]</em></span></p>
<p>Another possibility (also common in hidden valleys) is that the bottom-tagged jets aren&#8217;t actually from real bottom quarks, and are instead fake bottom jets generated by one or two new long-lived hidden valley particles.</p>
<p>But clearly, before anyone gets excited, far more evidence is required. We&#8217;ll need to see similar studies done at one or more of the three other experiments that ran concurrently with ALEPH &#8212; L3, OPAL, and DELPHI. And of course ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb will surely take a look in their own data; for instance, ATLAS and CMS could search for a dilepton resonance in events with at least two bottom-tagged jets, where the whole system of bottom-tagged jets and dileptons has a invariant mass not greater than about 100 GeV/c². <em><span style="color:#ff0000;">[[IMPORTANT NOTE ADDED: It has been pointed out to me (thanks Matt Reece) that there was <a href="http://cds.cern.ch/record/2223864?ln=en">a relevant CMS search</a> from 2015 that had somehow entirely escaped my attention, in which <strong>one</strong> b-tag was required and a di-muon bump was sought between 25 and 60 GeV.  Although not aimed at hidden valleys, it provides one of the few constraints upon them in this mass range.  And at first glance, it seems to disfavor any signal large enough to explain the ALEPH excess.  But there might be subtleties, so let me not draw firm conclusions yet.]]</span></em> They should also look for the V particle in other ways &#8212; perhaps following the methods I&#8217;ve suggested repeatedly (see for example pages 40-45 of <a href="http://indico.cern.ch/event/46250/attachments/950108/1348060/Strassler.LPC1.pdf">this 2008 talk</a>) &#8212; since the V might not only appear in Z particle decays. <em>[That is: look for boosted V&#8217;s; look for V&#8217;s in high-energy events or high missing-energy events; look for V&#8217;s in events with many jets, possibly with bottom-tags; etc.]</em> In any case, if anything like the V particle really exists, several (and perhaps all) of the experiments should see some evidence for it, and in more than just a single context.</p>
<p>Though we should be skeptical that today&#8217;s paper on ALEPH data is the first step toward a major discovery, at minimum it is important for what it indirectly confirms: that searches at the LHC are far from complete, and that discoveries might lie hidden, for example in rare Z decays (and in rare decays of other particles, such as the top quark.) Neither ATLAS, CMS nor LHCb have ever done a search for rare but spectacular Z particle decays, but they certainly could, as they recently did for the Higgs particle; and if Heister&#8217;s excess turns out to be a real signal, they will be seen to have missed a huge opportunity.  So I hope that Heister&#8217;s paper, at a minimum, will encourage the LHC experiments to undertake a broader and more comprehensive program of searches for low-mass particles with very weak interactions.  Otherwise, my own nightmare, in which the diamonds hidden in the rough might remain undetected &#8212; perhaps for decades &#8212; might come true.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back in the California Gold Rush, many people panning for gold saw a yellow glint at the bottom of their pans, and thought themselves lucky.  But more often than not, it was pyrite &#8212; iron sulfide &#8212; fool&#8217;s gold&#8230;</p>
<p>Back in December 2015, a bunch of particle physicists saw <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2015/12/18/so-what-is-it/">a bump on a plot</a>.  The plot showed the numbers of events with two photons <em>(particles of light)</em> as a function of the &#8220;<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-invariant-mass/">invariant mass</a>&#8221; of the photon pair.  (To be precise, they saw a big bump on one ATLAS plot, and a bunch of small bumps in similar plots by CMS and ATLAS [the two general purpose experiments at the Large Hadron Collider].)  What was that bump?  Was it a sign of a new particle?</p>
<p>A similar bump was <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/holiday-higgs-hints-confidence-inspiring-or-not/">the first sign of the Higgs boson</a>, though that was far from clear at the time.  What about <em>this</em> bump?</p>
<p>As I wrote in December,</p>
<p><em>  “Well, to be honest, probably it’s just that: a bump on a plot. But just in case it’s not…”</em></p>
<p>and I went on to describe what it might be if the bump were more than just a statistical fluke.  A lot of us &#8212; theoretical particle physicists like me &#8212; had a lot of fun, and learned a lot of physics, by considering what that bump might mean if it were a sign of something real.  (In fact I&#8217;ll be giving a talk here at CERN next week entitled <em>&#8220;Lessons from a Flash in the Pan,&#8221;</em> describing what I learned, or remembered, along the way.)</p>
<p>But updated results from CMS, based on a large amount of new data taken in 2016, have been seen.   (Perhaps these have leaked out early; they were supposed to be presented tomorrow along with those from ATLAS.)  They apparently show that where the bump was before, they now see nothing.  In fact there&#8217;s a small dip in the data there.</p>
<p>So &#8212; it seems that what we saw in those December plots was a fluke.  It happens.  I&#8217;m certainly disappointed, but hardly surprised.  Funny things happen with small amounts of data.</p>
<p>At the ICHEP 2016 conference, which started today, official presentation of the updated ATLAS and CMS two-photon results will come on Friday, but I think we all know the score.  So instead our focus will be on  the many other results (dozens and dozens, I hear) that the experiments will be showing us for the first time.  Already we had a small blizzard of them today.  I&#8217;m excited to see what they have to show us &#8230; the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/">Standard Model</a>, and <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/naturalness/">naturalness</a>, remain on trial.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the first time in some years, I&#8217;m spending two and a half weeks at CERN (the lab that hosts the Large Hadron Collider [LHC]). Most of my recent visits have been short or virtual, but this time* there&#8217;s <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/466926/">a theory workshop</a> that has collected together a number of theoretical particle physicists, and it&#8217;s a good opportunity for all of us to catch up with the latest creative ideas in the subject.   It&#8217;s also an opportunity to catch a glimpse of the furtive immensity of Mont Blanc, a hulking bump on the southern horizon, although only if (as is rarely the case) nature offers clear and beautiful weather.</p>
<p>More importantly, new results on the data collected so far in 2016 at the LHC are coming very soon!  They will be presented at the ICHEP conference that will be held in Chicago starting August 3rd. And there&#8217;s something we&#8217;ll be watching closely.</p>
<p>You may remember that <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2015/12/18/so-what-is-it/">in a post last December</a> I wrote:</p>
<p><em>  &#8220;Everybody wants to know. <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2015/12/16/is-this-the-beginning-of-the-end-of-the-standard-model/" target="_blank">That bump seen on the ATLAS and CMS two-photon plots</a>!  <strong>What… IS… it…?</strong>&#8220;</em></p>
<p>Why the excitement? A bump of this type can be a signal of a new particle (as was the case for <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-discovery-of-the-higgs/higgs-discovery-the-data/">the Higgs particle itself</a>.) And since a new particle that would produce a bump of this size was both completely unexpected and completely plausible, there was hope that we were seeing a hint of something new and important.</p>
<p>However, as I wrote in the same post,</p>
<p><em>  &#8220;Well, to be honest, probably it’s just that: a bump on a plot. But just in case it’s not&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>
<p>and I went on to discuss briefly what it might mean if it wasn&#8217;t just a statistical fluke. But speculation may be about to end: finally, we&#8217;re about to find out if it was indeed just a fluke &#8212; or a sign of something real.</p>
<p>Since December <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2016/06/09/pop-went-the-weasel-but-vroom-goes-the-lhc/">the amount of 13 TeV collision data available at ATLAS and CMS</a> (the two general purpose experiments at the LHC) has roughly quadrupled, which means that typical bumps and wiggles on their 2015-2016 plots have decreased in relative size by about a factor of two (= square root of four). If the December bump is just randomness, it should also decrease in relative size. If it&#8217;s real, it should remain roughly the same relative size, but appear more prominent relative to the random bumps and wiggles around it.</p>
<p>Now, there&#8217;s a caution to be added here. The December ATLAS bump was so large and fat compared to what was seen at CMS that (since reality has to appear the same at both experiments, once enough data has been collected) it was pretty obvious that <strong>even if it there were a real bump there, at ATLAS it was probably in combination with a statistical fluke that made it look larger and fatter than its true nature.</strong><em> [Something similar happened with the Higgs; <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/lhcposts/old-pages-of-historical-interest/the-december-higgs-update/">the initial bump that ATLAS saw was twice as big as expected</a>, which is why it showed up so early, but it gradually has shrunk as more data has been collected and it is now close to its expected size.  In retrospect, that tells us that ATLAS&#8217;s original signal was indeed combined with a statistical fluke that made it appear larger than it really is.]</em> What that means is that even if the December bumps were real, we would expect the ATLAS bump to shrink in size (but not statistical significance) and we would expect the CMS bump to remain of similar size (but grow in statistical significance). Remember, though, that &#8220;expectation&#8221; is not certainty, because at every stage statistical flukes (up or down) are possible.</p>
<p>In about a week we&#8217;ll find out where things currently stand. But the mood, as I read it here in the hallways and cafeteria, is not one of excitement. Moreover, the fact that the update to the results is (at the moment) unobtrusively scheduled for a parallel session of the ICHEP conference next Friday, afternoon time at CERN, suggests we&#8217;re not going  to see convincing evidence of anything exciting. If so, then the remaining question will be whether the reverse is true: whether the data will show convincing evidence that the December bump was definitely a fluke.</p>
<p>Flukes are guaranteed; with limited amounts of data, they can&#8217;t be avoided.  Discoveries, on the other hand, require skill, insight, and luck: you must ask a good question, address it with the best available methods, and be fortunate enough that (as is rarely the case) nature offers a clear and interesting answer.</p>
