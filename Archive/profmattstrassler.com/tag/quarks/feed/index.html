										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Familiar throughout our international culture, the &#8220;Big Bang&#8221; is well-known as the theory that scientists use to describe and explain the history of the universe. But the theory is not a single conceptual unit, and there are parts that are more reliable than others.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to understand that the theory &#8212; a set of equations describing how the universe <em>(more precisely, the <strong><em>observable patch</em></strong> of our universe, which may be a tiny fraction of the universe)</em> changes over time, and leading to sometimes precise predictions for what should, if the theory is right, be observed by humans in the sky &#8212; actually consists of different periods, some of which are far more speculative than others.  In the more speculative early periods, we must use equations in which we have limited confidence at best; moreover, data relevant to these periods, from observations of the cosmos and from particle physics experiments, is slim to none. In more recent periods, our confidence is very, very strong.</p>
<p>In my <a title="History of the Universe" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/" target="_blank">&#8220;History of the Universe&#8221; article</a> <em>[see also my related articles on <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">cosmic inflation</a>, on the <a title="Hot Big Bang" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/hot-big-bang/" target="_blank">Hot Big Bang</a>, and on the <a title="Before Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/before-inflation/" target="_blank">pre-inflation period</a>; also a comment that <a title="Big Bang: Expansion, NOT Explosion" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/big-bang-expansion-not-explosion/" target="_blank">the Big Bang is an expansion, <strong>not</strong> an explosion!</a>]</em>, the following figure appears, though without the colored zones, which I&#8217;ve added for this post. The colored zones emphasize what we know, what we suspect, and what we don&#8217;t know at all.</p>

In each colored zone, the degree of confidence and the observational/experimental source of that confidence is indicated. Three different possible starting points for the &#8220;Big Bang&#8221; are noted at the bottom; note that individual scientists may mean different things by the term.  <em>(Caution: there is a subtlety in the use of the words &#8220;Extremely Cold&#8221;; there are subtle quantum effects that I haven&#8217;t yet written about that complicate this notion.)</em></p></div>
<p>Notice that in the figure, I don&#8217;t measure time from the start of the universe.  That&#8217;s because I don&#8217;t <em>know</em> how or when the universe started (and in particular, the notion that <a title="Did The Universe Really Begin With a Singularity?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/21/did-the-universe-begin-with-a-singularity/" target="_blank">it started from a singularity</a>, or worse, <a title="Big Bang: Expansion, NOT Explosion" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/big-bang-expansion-not-explosion/" target="_blank">an exploding &#8220;cosmic egg&#8221;</a>, is simply an over-extrapolation to the past and a misunderstanding of what the theory actually says.) Instead I measure time from the start of the <strong>Hot</strong> Big Bang in the observable patch of the universe.  <em>I also don&#8217;t even know precisely when the Hot Big Bang started, but the uncertainty on that initial time (relative to other events) is less than one second &#8212; so all the times I&#8217;ll mention, which are much longer than that, aren&#8217;t affected by this uncertainty.</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll now take you through the different confidence zones of the Big Bang, from the latest to the earliest, as indicated in the figure above.</p>
<p><span id="more-7537"></span></p>
<p><strong>The Green Zone: Confidence</strong></p>
<p>A key clue that the observable patch of the universe was once hot and dense, and cooling as it expanded &#8212; i.e. that there <em>was</em> a Hot Big Bang period (preceded perhaps by cosmic inflation, but we don&#8217;t need to focus on that yet) &#8212; is the presence in the universe of the cosmic microwave background [CMB]. From all parts of the sky, an easily detectable sea of electromagnetic radiation in the form of microwaves (photons with energy about 1000 times less than photons of visible light) is streaming across the universe, and onto the Earth. Not only is the CMB a broad clue as to the universe&#8217;s past, it is also a key tool for scientists to use in finding even more precise and focused clues. Much of the history of the observable patch is imprinted in the details of the CMB.</p>
<p>A prediction of the Hot Big Bang is that the microwaves are just a sign of past heat, and of nothing else. Specifically, if you measure the microwave photons&#8217; energy, and plot <em>the amount of energy</em> coming from a patch of sky due to photons <em>of a particular frequency</em>, you should see the same plot (a &#8220;black-body spectrum&#8221;, as it is called) as you would see for photons emitted by a cold piece of ice or rock or metal.  [Yes, ice at 2.7 degrees C above <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/01/07/happy-chilly-new-year/" target="_blank">absolute zero</a> does glow in microwaves.]  The fact that the COBE satellite&#8217;s data agrees closely with the prediction of a black-body spectrum (shown in the figure) is overwhelming evidence that there was a Hot Big Bang going on at the time that atoms first formed, when the observable patch of the universe became transparent to light &#8212; a time now believed to be about 380,000 years after the Hot Big Bang began.</p>

Data from the COBE satellite is the red crosses; the green curve is the prediction of a black-body spectrum.</p></div>
<p>The most powerful evidence that a simple view of the Hot Big Bang is correct even earlier is the success of the theory (i.e. equations) for nucleosynthesis: the formation of <a title="The Nuclei of Atoms: At the Heart of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-nuclei-of-atoms-at-the-heart-of-matter/" target="_blank">atomic nuclei</a> for the lightest atoms during the Hot Big Bang.  <em>(Note the atoms themselves formed hundreds of thousands of years later, when the temperature was cool enough for <a title="Electrons: On the Outskirts of Atoms" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/electrons-on-the-outskirts-of-atoms/" target="_blank">the nuclei to capture electrons</a>.)</em>  The equations of the Hot Big Bang include</p>
<ul>
<li>Einstein&#8217;s version of gravity and</li>
<li>the &#8220;quantum field theory&#8221; used to describe <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the known particles and non-gravitational forces.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These equations can be used to calculate how abundant certain light atoms should be, if there was a Hot Big Bang.  Specifically, one can compute the ratios of how much hydrogen <em>(normal <strong>and</strong> heavy [&#8220;deuterium&#8221;])</em>, helium <em>(normal [&#8220;helium-4&#8221;] <strong>and</strong> light [&#8220;helium-3&#8221;])</em>, and lithium should be present in pristine parts of the observable patch, if the atomic nuclei of those elements were mainly forged during the cooling stages of the Hot Big Bang. If the elements other than hydrogen were only formed in stars, then there should be very little helium and virtually no deuterium in the observable patch of the universe. (Deuterium is actually destroyed in stars.) But in a cooling Hot Big Bang, a lot of helium &#8212; about 1/4 of the amount of hydrogen &#8212; and a small but measurable amount of deuterium should be produced.</p>
<p>These predictions of the Hot Big Bang depend in great detail on our understanding of particle physics and gravity &#8212; <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">of the weak nuclear force, the strong nuclear force, the electromagnetic force, the gravitational force (in Einstein&#8217;s version of it) and on the properties of neutrinos, electrons, photons, protons and neutrons.</a> And the numbers work! The amount of helium, relative to ordinary hydrogen, is predicted to be in the 20 &#8211; 25% range; deuterium is predicted to be in the range of one part in 10,000 to 100,000, helium-3 a factor of 10 smaller than that, and lithium in the part per 10 billion range. The data agree!</p>

<p>That these predictions agree with observations of the distant cosmos (see the figure below) provides a strong argument that the Hot Big Bang really occurred, and was originally hot enough to break apart nuclei.  That means that temperatures were initially at least hot enough that the typical particle had an energy of about 0.001 <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/" target="_blank">GeV</a>, which would have happened a few minutes after the Hot Big Bang began.  More precise measurements even help us understand how much ordinary matter there is in the observable patch of the universe, with results that agree with other measurements of the same quantity.</p>
<p>For this reason, I&#8217;ve marked the nucleosynthesis period and what follows it in <span style="color:#008000;">green</span>, to emphasize that we have strong observational evidence that the Hot Big Bang did occur, and was so hot &#8212; hot enough to destroy atomic nuclei &#8212; that the atomic nuclei around us today had to form from scratch as the temperature cooled.</p>
<p><strong>The Yellow Zone: Extrapolating a Bit Using Particle Physics</strong></p>
<p>However, for times before nucleosynthesis, the arguments are weaker. We don&#8217;t have much direct evidence for what was taking place. But we have a lot of knowledge about particle physics, up to energies of a few hundred GeV, thanks to the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC] and its predecessors over the last few decades.  So if we assume that the Hot Big Bang started at temperatures so high that a typical particle would have had an energy of a few hundred <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/" target="_blank">GeV</a>, we can calculate the observable patch&#8217;s properties from that temperature downward. At such a high temperature,</p>

<li>the <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">Higgs field would have been &#8220;off&#8221;</a>, so <a title="The Known Particles — If The Higgs Field Were Zero" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/the-known-particles-if-the-higgs-field-were-zero/" target="_blank">many particles would not have had their usual masses</a>; and</li>

<p>As the temperature cooled, we can calculate <em>(now that <a title="Discovery of the Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-discovery-of-the-higgs/" target="_blank">we know the Higgs particle&#8217;s mass</a>, and if we assume there aren&#8217;t any lightweight particles that we don&#8217;t know about)</em> that first the Higgs field would have turned &#8220;on&#8221;, making the weak nuclear force henceforth weak; and then, a bit later, the strong nuclear force would have become very strong, so that quarks and gluons and anti-quarks would have been trapped henceforth and forever into <a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/" target="_blank">protons</a>, <a title="The Nuclei of Atoms: At the Heart of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-nuclei-of-atoms-at-the-heart-of-matter/" target="_blank">neutrons</a>, anti-protons and anti-neutrons, as well as other very short-lived <a title="What’s a Hadron?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-hadron-as-in-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">hadrons</a>.</p>
<p>However, we can&#8217;t yet directly confirm <em>by cosmological observation</em> that this is true.  It&#8217;s not entirely impossible that there was something odd and unknown about the universe that makes some of these conclusions premature. Someday we may be able to be more certain, but not yet. So in this time period, starting just before the Higgs field turns on and going until nucleosynthesis, we have a highly educated guess as to what was happening, though no direct experimental checks.  That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve marked this time period in <span style="color:#333333;">yellow</span>.</p>
<p><strong>The Orange Zone: What Started the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Hot</span> Big Bang?</strong></p>
<p>Even earlier? Well, at even higher temperatures we don&#8217;t know the particle physics with confidence; we&#8217;d need particle accelerators more powerful than the LHC.  To figure out what happened in the Big Bang in detail, we have to make assumptions about the particles available, without any way to check them. But still, we are not without information, because we do have an experimental probe: the CMB itself.</p>
<p>It is a remarkable fact that the CMB is incredibly uniform, to one part in 100,000. That&#8217;s already information, and explaining why it&#8217;s true is one of the arguments in favor of <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">cosmic inflation</a>.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s much, much more information in the <em>imperfections</em> in that uniformity. The non-uniformities, which were discovered by the COBE satellite, have been studied in detail by the WMAP and Planck satellites, along with many other experiments from the ground. And it was in studying the non-uniformities in the CMB and their tiny bit of polarization that BICEP2 made <a title="BICEP2: New Evidence Of Cosmic Inflation!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/bicep2-new-evidence-of-cosmic-inflation/" target="_blank">the big (but <del>unconfirmed</del> now discredited) discovery that was announced last week</a> (here&#8217;s some <a title="A Primer On Today’s Events" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/a-primer-on-todays-events/" target="_blank">background information on that discovery, in the form of FAQs, that you may find useful</a>).</p>
<p>The photons in the CMB are astonishingly sensitive. There are very few things that affect them, and fortunately, most of the things that do are relics from the extremely early periods of the observable patch of the universe. It&#8217;s an unexpected gift for scientists that this is true! The CMB photons were created about 380,000 years after the Hot Big Bang, and yet they give us insight into the entire period before that, all the way back to a period <em>just before</em> the Hot Big Bang!!!  (They also can give us important insights into what happened <em>after</em> 380,000 years, too.)  To me, this incredibly sensitivity of the CMB is one of the most amazing natural phenomena in all of science&#8230; and it has been the key to progress in cosmology in recent years.</p>
<p>Detailed measurements of the CMB have increasingly given us insight into the zone marked in orange, where we don&#8217;t have any particle physics data &#8212; just guesses, and calculations based on those guesses.  The reason insights have been possible is that our calculations rely on very general properties of the Hot Big Bang and the pre-Hot Big Bang period to make predictions.  What I mean by this is that these calculations begin with very simple assumptions about the patterns of non-uniformities that were present at the start of the Hot Big Bang, and then we check if these assumptions give predictions for non-uniformities in the CMB that agree with data.  They do!  This is shown in the figure below, where predictions of the Hot Big Bang theory, <em>with these simple assumptions about the starting point</em>, are compared with data from the Planck satellite. (Similar but less precise measurements were made before Planck, by WMAP and a number of ground-based experiments.)</p>

<p>Thus, simple assumptions about the non-uniformities at the start of the Hot Big Bang seem to be right, more or less.  This lends support to the hypothesis of cosmic inflation, which can produce simple non-uniformities. But it&#8217;s not convincing, because one can imagine simple non-uniformities arising in some other way.  There is at least one alternative &#8212; the ekpyrotic universe &#8212; that is also largely consistent with this data, and there might have been others that no one has thought of.  Meanwhile, there were many qualitatively different forms that cosmic inflation might take, some of which could have been consistent with universes quite different from those with a simple Big Bang.  For example, the data has been consistent with universes that, at temperatures a bit higher than reached in the yellow zone in the figure, have more spatial dimensions than the three we&#8217;re used to. So the number of possible options in the orange zone has been very large, and the degree of speculation involved has been very high.</p>

<p>This <del>may have changed</del> with <a title="BICEP2: New Evidence Of Cosmic Inflation!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/bicep2-new-evidence-of-cosmic-inflation/">BICEP2s new measurement,</a> which <del>gives</del> unfortunately did not give powerful new evidence for cosmic inflation through inflation&#8217;s generation of gravitational waves&#8230; assuming the measurement itself, and the interpretation of the measurement, both hold up over time.  <em>[The interpretation did not.]</em> Since a measurable amount of gravitational waves can only be produced, as far as we know, if a period of inflation occurred and was <a title="If It Holds Up, What Might BICEP2′s Discovery Mean?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/18/if-its-holds-up-what-might-bicep2s-discovery-mean/" target="_blank">driven by a <strong>very</strong> large amount of &#8220;dark `energy&#8217; &#8220;</a>, BICEP2&#8217;s result may rule out all known alternatives to inflation, and significantly narrow down the options for how inflation may have occurred, excluding many of the more radical options as well as many simple ones. As such, it may increase confidence in the inflation hypothesis to change the color of the orange zone to yellow, or even, as more measurements come in and become more precise, to green.  <em>[But it did not.]</em></p>
<p>However, let&#8217;s not jump to conclusions until the measurement is confirmed with more data and by other observing teams.  <em>[You see how important it is that I write these cautionary caveats in my articles.  I have seen many measurements come and go; the fraction that stick is much less than half.]</em></p>
<p><strong>The Red Zone: Scientific Guesswork</strong></p>
<p>But BICEP2 can really only tell us about <strong><em>the late stage and exit from inflation</em></strong>. If we go deep into the inflationary period and try to go earlier, into the red zone in the figure, we face two problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>we don&#8217;t have any experimental probes of this early time, and</li>
<li>we don&#8217;t know which particle physics and/or gravity equations we should be using.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not yet have any cosmological observations that access this time period; the CMB photons bring us back to the late stage of inflation, but not further. We cannot infer much yet from CMB measurements about the &#8220;inflaton&#8221; field (and its particle) that is supposed to play the dominant particle-physics role during inflation, and we have no idea what other types of fields it may interact with, so it is hard to be sure what type of process got inflation started. Meanwhile, theoretical physics doesn&#8217;t help much either. We can try assuming that string theory is the true theory of quantum gravity in our world, but if we do that, we still find the equations are hard to solve and give, at best, a variety of possibilities. And trying to work in greater generality, without assuming string theory, doesn&#8217;t help; the calculations are still ambiguous and difficult. This doesn&#8217;t stop theoretical physicists from making educated, scientific guesses &#8212; i.e., speculations backed with concrete equations and calculations. But until we get some data that allows us to distinguish the many possibilities, we can&#8217;t say for sure what was actually happening back then.</p>
<p>So if people tells you that the universe <em>started</em> in such and such a way, perhaps &#8220;<a title="Did The Universe Really Begin With a Singularity?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/21/did-the-universe-begin-with-a-singularity/" target="_blank">with a singularity</a>&#8221; or &#8220;with a quantum fluctuation out of nothing&#8221; or &#8220;in the Big Crunch (i.e. the collapse) of a previous phase of the universe&#8221;, remember that they&#8217;re telling you about the <span style="color:#ff0000;">red zone</span>. They&#8217;re neglecting to tell you that what they&#8217;re saying is pure theory, with neither an experiment to back it up nor a clear theoretical reason to believe their suggestion is unique and preferable over someone else&#8217;s alternative. Only a bit later in cosmic history, once we focus on the late stages of inflation, and forward in time from there to nucleosynthesis, do we have both data (cosmological observation and particle physics collisions) and reasonably reliable theory (Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity plus the Standard Model of particle physics). Our confidence grows as time moves forward, the observable patch of the universe cools, and physics becomes of a sort that we&#8217;ve tested in numerous experiments already.</p>
<p>From this, I hope that you can see that the Big Bang Theory really isn&#8217;t a single, undifferentiated structure.  The most reliable part of the theory is that there was, at one point, a <a title="Hot Big Bang" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/hot-big-bang/" target="_blank">Hot stage of the Big Bang</a>. (Some people call that the Big Bang, in fact.) If BICEP2&#8217;s measurement is accurate, and correctly interpreted, then the reliable portion of the theory may then include a period of <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">inflation that preceded</a> the Hot Big Bang. (Some people would call &#8220;inflation plus the Hot Big Bang&#8221; the &#8220;Big Bang&#8221;.) But anything before inflation is not in the least reliable&#8230; in particular, the notion that the universe&#8217;s heat and density increased <a title="Did The Universe Really Begin With a Singularity?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/21/did-the-universe-begin-with-a-singularity/" target="_blank">to the extent that Einstein&#8217;s equations have a singularity, presumably indicating that they&#8217;re not sufficient to describe what was going on, is an <em>assumption</em></a>. So that part of the Big Bang Theory may not survive the test of time. You should be prepared, as scientists are, to let it go.  After all, from 1960-1980 people had a vision of the early Big Bang that didn&#8217;t include something like inflation; their version was significantly adjusted as knowledge was gained, so why shouldn&#8217;t ours be?</p>
<p>Moreover, it is quite possible that the start of the universe, which people often refer to as the ultimate Big Bang, may not have had anything &#8220;Bang-ish&#8221; or even Big about it.  Yes, we might even need to let go someday of the idea that the universe truly <em>began</em> with a Big Bang. The scientific community won&#8217;t have any problem with this, because many of us have never taken that idea very seriously in the first place.  But what about the rest of our society, which seems to hold to this name and notion far harder than do scientists themselves, to the point of <em>(egad!)</em> naming a television show after it?!  The loss may be more shocking than necessary&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">[This is part 5 of a series, which begins <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/23/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions/" target="_blank">here</a>.]</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">In <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part 4)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/07/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-4/" target="_blank">a previous post</a>, I told you about how physicists use computers to study how the strong nuclear force combines certain elementary particles &#8212; specifically quarks and anti-quarks and gluons &#8212; into <a title="What’s a Hadron?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-hadron-as-in-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">hadrons</a>, such as protons and neutrons and pions.  Computers can also be used to study certain other phenomena that, because they involve the strong nuclear force where it is truly &#8220;strong&#8221; <em>[in the technical sense <a title="The Strengths of the Known Forces" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-forces-of-nature/the-strength-of-the-known-forces/" target="_blank">described here</a>]</em>, can&#8217;t be studied using simpler methods of successive approximation. While computers aren&#8217;t a panacea, they do allow some important and difficult questions about the strong nuclear force to be answered with precision.</span></p>
<p>To do these calculations, physicists study an imaginary world, as I described;</p>
<ul>
<li>all forces except the strong nuclear force are ignored, and</li>
<li>all particles are forgotten except the gluons and the up, down and strange quarks (and their anti-quarks).</li>
<li>On top of this, the up, down and strange quark masses are typically <em>changed</em>. They are taken larger, which makes the calculations easier, and then gradually reduced towards their small values in the real world.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Notion of &#8220;Effective&#8221; Quantum Field Theories</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s one more interesting method for understanding the strong nuclear force that I haven&#8217;t mentioned yet, and it too involves changing the quark masses &#8212; making them <em>smaller</em>, rather than larger! And weirdly, this doesn&#8217;t involve the equations of the quantum field theory for the quarks, antiquarks and gluons <em>at all</em>. It involves a different quantum field theory altogether &#8212; one which says nothing about the quarks and gluons, but instead describes the physics of the hadrons themselves. More precisely, its equations are useful for making predictions about <strong><em>the hadrons of lowest mass</em></strong> &#8212; <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part 4)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/07/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-4/" target="_blank">called pions, kaons and etas</a> &#8212; and it works for processes</p>
<ul>
<li>with rather <strong>low energy</strong> &#8212; too low to affect the behavior of the quarks and anti-quarks and gluons inside the pions &#8212; and</li>
<li>at rather <strong>long distance</strong> &#8212; too long to detect that the pions have a lot of internal structure.</li>
</ul>
<p>This includes some of the phenomena involved in the physics of atomic nuclei, the next level up in <a title="The Structure of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/" target="_blank">the structure of matter</a> (<a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">quarks/gluons</a> → <a title="Protons and Neutrons: The Massive Pandemonium in Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/protons-and-neutrons/" target="_blank">protons/neutrons</a> → <a title="The Nuclei of Atoms: At the Heart of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-nuclei-of-atoms-at-the-heart-of-matter/" target="_blank">nuclei</a> → <a title="Atoms: Building Blocks of Molecules" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/atoms-building-blocks-of-molecules/" target="_blank">atoms</a> → <a title="The Molecular Structure of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-molecular-structure-of-matter/" target="_blank">molecules</a>).<span id="more-6803"></span></p>
<p>Notice this is the opposite regime of where the quantum field theory of quarks and gluons works well!  <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part 3)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/01/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-3/" target="_blank">Successive approximation</a> works well at short distance and high energy, for any quark masses, and <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part 4)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/07/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-4/" target="_blank">computer simulations</a> are easiest for larger quark masses.  But long distances and low energies are very important, because processes important in our lives obviously involve longer distances than protons, and also (less obviously) involve energies much lower than those involved in holding the proton together.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">This kind of theory is often called an &#8220;effective quantum field theory&#8221;; it is useful for making predictions about low-energy and long-distance phenomena, but it&#8217;s not a </span><strong style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;">complete</strong><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;"> theory, because it can&#8217;t predict what happens to pions and kaons and etas at </span><em style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;">higher</em><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;"> energy and </span><em style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;">shorter</em><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;"> distance. <em> [What actually does happen is that their inner structure becomes really important in their behavior.]</em>  This is in contrast to the quantum field theory of the quarks and anti-quarks and gluons, which is supposed to apply at </span><strong style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;">all</strong><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;"> energies and distances that we&#8217;ve measured so far, and perhaps even much higher energies and shorter distances.

The effective quantum field theory of the pions etc. simplifies the problem for us, and gives us a tool that we can use in understanding how nuclei form, etc.   We don&#8217;t need to follow all the details of quarks and gluons to understand how nuclei form, just as we don&#8217;t need to follow all the details of atomic nuclei to understand how atoms form.</span></p>

The real world&#8217;s quark masses (blue dashed line) are low enough for the effective theory of hadrons and just barely high enough for modern computer simulations.</p></div>
<p>The complementary nature of the various approaches to the strong nuclear forces is illustrated in Figure 1.  <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part 3)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/01/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-3/" target="_blank">Successive approximation</a><em> [or  &#8220;perturbation theory&#8221; in jargonese]</em> works (no matter what the quark masses are) at short distances, where the strong nuclear force isn&#8217;t strong, in the technical sense.  Computers are needed, and useful, at intermediate distances, but are easiest when the quark masses are much larger than in the real world.  And finally, the method of an effective theory for the low-energy behavior of the lowest-mass hadrons is especially powerful when the quark masses, and therefore the masses of the pions, kaons and etas, are very small.  Notice that in the real world (indicated by the blue dashes) the quarks masses are simultaneously small enough and large enough to allow some overlap between the various methods. In short, we are lucky: we can check our understanding of the strong nuclear force in multiple ways.  If the quark masses had been much smaller or somewhat larger, this would have been more difficult.  [Had they been much larger, things would have simplified again; but that&#8217;s another story for another day.]</p>
<p>This effective theory explains that <em><strong>if the up, down and strange quarks&#8217; masses were reduced to zero, then pions, and their cousins called kaons and etas, would become massless.</strong></em> <em>[Technically: they would be Nambu-Goldstone particles, bosons in particular, whose presence is a consequence of the &#8220;spontaneous breaking&#8221;, or hiding, of a subtle symmetry.]</em> Meanwhile, <strong><em>protons and neutrons would change rather little from what we find in nature</em></strong> &#8212; their masses would be almost the same as before. <em>[This is one of the reasons why <a title="Why the Higgs and Gravity are Unrelated" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/10/15/why-the-higgs-and-gravity-are-unrelated/" target="_blank">the naive statement that the Higgs field is responsible for all mass in the universe is dreadfully wrong</a>; even if the Higgs field were zero and the quarks were massless, the protons and neutrons that provide you with most of <strong>your</strong> mass would still have masses.]</em></p>
<p>This theory also explains why many processes involving hadrons are related to one another, and occur with the same (or similar) probabilities or rates.  Moreover, even figuring out just how changing the quark masses affects our computer simulations requires this effective theory.</p>
<p>Where did this effective quantum field theory come from, since it preceded the theory of quarks and anti-quarks and gluons? Well, its origin is a classic one. Essentially, it was simply <strong>guessed</strong>, based on <em>experimental measurements</em> of pions&#8217; properties, made in the 1950s and 1960s, before quarks or gluons had even been imagined. Remarkably, even today, after decades of study, no one can take the quantum field theory of the elementary particles &#8212; the equations that describe the quarks, anti-quarks and gluons &#8212; and extract in a <strong><em>direct</em></strong> way the equations for the effective quantum field theory of the lightweight hadrons. <em>  </em>The equations for the pions, etc. must <strong><em>&#8220;emerge&#8221;</em></strong> from the equations for the quarks, etc., but so far no one has figured just how that works mathematically.  Consequently, <em><strong>without experimental data</strong>, it would have been much harder to guess the right effective quantum field theory, and impossible to verify the guess was correct.</em></p>
<p>So when we consider imaginary worlds for which we have no experiments to guide us, and for which no one has done extensive computer studies (if they are even possible), we often find ourselves in some difficulty figuring out what would happen in such a world&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A brief mention today of <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1205.5442" target="_blank">a new measurement from the BABAR experimental collaboration</a>, which tests lepton universality (to be explained below) and finds it wanting.</p>
<p><strong>The Basic Story (Slightly Oversimplified)</strong></p>
<p>Within the Standard Model of particle physics (the equations that describe and predict the behavior of all of <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the known particles and forces</a>), the effects of the weak nuclear force on the three leptons &#8212; the electron, the muon and the tau &#8212; are all expected to be identical. This called &#8220;lepton universality&#8221;. <span id="more-3665"></span>This expectation has been tested many times; for instance, the probability that a negatively charged W particle decays to an electron plus an electron anti-neutrino is the same as for it to decay to a muon plus a muon anti-neutrino, and the same for a tau plus a tau anti-neutrino, to very good precision.</p>
<p>Another place (see Figure 1) to test &#8220;lepton universality&#8221; is in the decay of a <a title="What’s a Hadron?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-hadron-as-in-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">hadron</a> containing a bottom quark to a hadron containing a charm quark plus a lepton plus a corresponding anti-neutrino. (Specifically, the focus here is on hadrons called &#8220;mesons&#8221; which contain a bottom quark or charm quark, an up or down anti-quark,and, as for all hadrons, lots of gluons and quark-antiquark pairs.)</p>

The D meson will rapidly decay to other particles (not shown, but these must all be experimentally detected in order to know a D meson was present) and the tau will also rapidly decay, sometimes to an electron or muon, along with an undetectable neutrino and anti-neutrino.&lt;/p&gt;

Only the bottom and charm quarks in the mesons are shown, but the mesons also contain an up and down anti-quark, along with many gluons and quark-antiquark pairs.</p></div>
<p>These decays occur via the weak nuclear force (more precisely, through the effect of a W <a title="Virtual Particles: What are they?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/virtual-particles-what-are-they/" target="_blank">&#8220;virtual particle&#8221; [which is not really a particle at all, but a more generalized disturbance in the W field]</a>) so the probability for such a decay in which a tau is produced should be related to the probability for the case where a muon or electron is produced. The meson with a bottom quark is called a B, the meson with a charm quark is called a D, so for shorthand the decays to the three leptons and their corresponding anti-neutrinos are called B → D e ν, B → D μ ν and B → D τ ν.</p>
<p>However, testing lepton universality in this particular context is a little tricky, because <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the masses of the three leptons</a> are different &#8212; because their interactions with the Higgs field are not universal &#8212; and in this class of decays, the difference matters. Whereas a W particle has a mass of 80 GeV/c<sup>2</sup>, so big that the tau lepton&#8217;s 1.8 GeV/c<sup>2</sup> mass is too small to play any role in the W&#8217;s decay, the B and D mesons have masses around 5.3 and 1.9 GeV/c<sup>2</sup> respectively, and the difference in those masses is not that much bigger than the tau&#8217;s mass. As a result, although the probability of B → D e ν and B → D μ ν are expected to be (and are measured to be) the same, the probability for B → D τ ν is not expected to be the same as for B → D e ν. But, with some difficulty, the difference in these probabilities can be predicted using the Standard Model&#8217;s equations. And recently the relative probabilities have been measured, by the <a href="http://www-public.slac.stanford.edu/babar/" target="_blank">BABAR experiment</a> (which studied B mesons produced in the collisions of electrons and positrons at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in California; the experiment was shut down in 2008, but data analysis continues.) <em><strong>The measurement differs from the prediction, coming in too high by what can arguably be said to be 3.4 standard deviations (3.4 &#8220;σ&#8221;.)</strong></em></p>
<p>That&#8217;s the short story. The real story is quite a bit longer, as always.</p>
<p><strong>Some Additional Important Details</strong></p>
<p>First, this is not a completely straightforward measurement. τ leptons can&#8217;t be measured directly, because they decay very quickly. In this measurement, they are detected only when they decay to electrons or to muons, plus a neutrino and anti-neutrino that go undetected. Wait, you say&#8230; how can we tell the difference between B → D e ν and B → D τ ν if the τ then decays to an e plus undetected neutrinos?! The reason is that on average the electron from the τ decay has lower energy (and there are other tricks too.) Even better, an electron-positron collider is a precision machine, unlike <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">a hadron collider like the LHC</a>, so the total energy and total momentum of the undetected neutrinos can be inferred from the measurement of everything that <em>is</em> detected. If there&#8217;s only one neutrino or anti-neutrino, as in B → D e ν, then (because the neutrino mass is so tiny) you would expect the missing momentum and missing energy to satisfy E<sub>miss</sub> = p<sub>miss</sub> c to the available precision. If there are three neutrinos or anti-neutrinos, as in B → D τ ν, you expect the E<sub>miss</sub> &gt; p<sub>miss</sub> c. Technically, we define &#8220;missing mass&#8221; by m<sub>miss</sub><sup>2</sup> c<sup>4</sup> = E<sub>miss</sub><sup>2</sup> &#8211; p<sub>miss</sub><sup>2</sup>c<sup>2</sup> ; it is substantially non-zero only for the decays to taus. (The name is misleading; it isn&#8217;t mass that is missing, but the invariant mass of the undetected particles.)</p>
<p>So in the end it is possible to look for B → D + e + invisible particles, and separate (on average, statistically &#8212; see Figure 2) the ones that have a higher energy lepton and no &#8220;missing mass&#8221; that come from B → D e ν from the lower energy ones with &#8220;missing mass&#8221; that come from B → D τ ν. Unfortunately, the measurement is made more complicated by the presence of some other unrelated processes that give a similar-looking signal. But these effects are believed to be known to sufficient precision as to not interfere with the measurement. [Nevertheless, this appears to be one of the weakest points in the measurement &#8212; though I don&#8217;t yet know all the details of the measurement technique and so I might be wrong.]</p>

<p>Second, I&#8217;ve oversimplified; there are two types of common B and D mesons; those with spin 0 are called B and D, while those with spin 1 are called B* and D*. The experimenters have measured both B → D* τ ν relative to B → D e ν and B → D τ ν relative to B → D* e ν. Both come out high, by 2.0 and 2.7 σ. Only when combined together does one obtain the claimed 3.4 σ.</p>
<p>R(D)  = ratio of rate for B → D τ ν relative to the sum of rates for B → D e ν + B → D μ ν + B → D τ ν.</p>

<ul>
<li>Measured: 0.332 ± 0.024 ± 0.018 .</li>
<li>Predicted:  0.252±0.003</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:25px;">Here the first and second error bars on the measurements are statistical and systematic uncertainties, and the error on the prediction indicates known uncertainties in the calculation.</span></p>
<p><strong>Implications, If Any</strong></p>
<p>Is this excess a real effect that indicates a breakdown of the Standard Model? We&#8217;ve seen plenty of measurements with 3 σ deviations from the Standard Model prediction in the past year (see <a title="LHCb’s Result From November Appears Confirmed by CDF" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/01/lhcbs-result-from-november-appears-confirmed-by-cdf/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a title="Apparent Unexpected Asymmetries in the Production of Quarks" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/tevatron-news/apparent-unexpected-asymmetries-in-the-production-of-quarks/" target="_blank">here</a> for examples), but in some cases it looks as though the measurement may have been wrong, or simply a statistical fluctuation, while in others it looks as though the original theoretical prediction may have wrong. We can hope this new measurement indicates something real, but <strong><em>as usual, while it is worth taking note of, it is too early to get very excited</em></strong>. We need to see confirmation by another experiment and some additional theoretical checks on the predictions.</p>
<p>If it is a real effect, what could cause it? One obvious possible source of a violation of universality could be a new electrically-charged Higgs particle, not predicted in the Standard Model but predicted by many theories that have multiple Higgs fields and particles. (Among them is <a title="Supersymmetry — What Is It?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/supersymmetry-what-is-it/" target="_blank">supersymmetry</a>.) In simple versions of this idea, a charged Higgs <a title="Virtual Particles: What are they?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/virtual-particles-what-are-they/" target="_blank">virtual particle (which isn&#8217;t really a particle, but a more general disturbance in the charged Higgs field)</a> would contribute to these processes (Figure 3), and change the B → D τ ν rate more than the other two, because it interacts much more strongly with the heavier tau lepton than with the electron or muon. BABAR claims that the simplest version of this idea doesn&#8217;t fit their data, but there are a lot of subtleties with that remark (in particular the presence of a new particle changes not only the decay probabilities but also the energy distributions shown in Figure 2, so the data has to be reanalysed carefully for each possible type of charged Higgs.)</p>

<p>Are there any other possibilities? Good question. One thing that is worth noting is that this effect (at least as currently measured) is very large &#8212; I&#8217;m referring here not its statistical significance of 3.4 σ, which is moderate at best, but the size of the effect itself, something like a 50% excess over expectation from the Standard Model prediction. It is not easy to get an effect that big from anything indirect, such as a complicated quantum mechanical process. In fact, even a direct effect from a single virtual particle, along the lines of the charged Higgs idea, has to be on the large side &#8212; especially since any simple charged (non-virtual!) particle of this type has to be quite heavy (certainly heavier than 100 GeV/c<sup>2</sup>, from LEP collider measurements, and <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/18/at-the-search-workshop-on-the-lhc/" target="_blank">probably closer to 150</a>, from LHC measurements).  Making a theory with such a large effect consistent with all other existing measurements may be a tall order.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The final panel discussion at the Maryland SEARCH workshop &#8212; six theoretical particle physicists talking about the 2011 experimental results from the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC] and looking ahead to the 2012 data &#8212; has finally been <a href="http://vimeo.com/41159579" target="_blank">posted online</a>, along with <a href="http://www.umdphysics.umd.edu/searchworkshop/602-schedule-.html" target="_blank">the rest of the presentations at the workshop</a>. I wrote about the workshop, which took place in mid-March, <a title="At the SEARCH Workshop on the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/18/at-the-search-workshop-on-the-lhc/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a title="Latest from the SEARCH Workshop" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/20/latest-from-the-search-workshop/" target="_blank">here</a>.  In the latter post, I wrote:</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">The workshop concluded with a panel discussion &#8212; the only point during the entire workshop when theorists were formally asked to say something.</span> <span style="color:#008000;">The panel consisted of Michael Peskin<em> (senior statesman [<em>and my Ph.D. advisor</em>] famous for many reasons, including fundamental work on the implications of highly precise measurements )</em>, Nima Arkani-Hamed <em>(junior statesman, and famous for helping develop several revolutionary new ways of approaching the <a title="The Hierarchy Problem" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#008000;">hierarchy problem</span></a>)</em>,  Riccardo Rattazzi <em>(also famous for conceptual advances in dealing with the hierarchy problem)</em>, Gavin Salam (<em>famous for his work advancing the applications of the theory of quarks and gluons, including revolutionary methods for dealing with <a title="Jets: The Manifestation of Quarks and Gluons" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/jets-the-manifestation-of-quarks-and-gluons/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#008000;">jets</span></a>)</em>, and myself <em>(famous for talking too much&#8230; though come to think of it, that was true of the whole panel, except Gavin.)</em> And Raman Sundrum, one of the organizers<em> (and famous for his collaboration with Lisa Randall in introducing &#8220;warped&#8221; <a title="Extra Dimensions" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/extra-dimensions/" target="_blank">extra dimensions</a>, and also anomaly-mediated <a title="Supersymmetry" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/" target="_blank">supersymmetry</a> breaking [which was competitive with a paper by Rattazzi and his colleagues])</em> informally participated too.<span id="more-3516"></span></span></p>
<p>What I like most about this discussion is that it captures a historic moment, as we are still mulling over the field-altering implications of the 2011 LHC data, but before we have enough data to really figure out what it&#8217;s telling us.  It is interesting to see where the panelists largely agree with one another and where they don&#8217;t. And it will be fascinating to look back at this video even as soon as a year from now; the same panel, if it were to be held in March 2013, would surely have very different things to say.  Maybe when we get there I&#8217;ll ask the panelists to write about how their views have changed over the year.</p>
<p><em><span style="color:#888888;">I feel I should say something about the fact that all the members of this panel are male. You should not conclude that the leading figures in the field are all male. Certainly if Lisa Randall [Harvard University] or Ann Nelson [University of Washington], two of the greatest theoretical particle physicists working today (and with whom I was fortunate to write papers in the 90s), had attended this conference, I am sure they would have been sitting on this panel, in place of less eminent panelists (me, for instance).</span></em></p>
<p>Now on to <a href="http://vimeo.com/41159579" target="_blank">the video</a>:</p>
<p>Left to right (from the viewer&#8217;s point of view):</p>
<ul>
<li>Raman Sundrum [University of Maryland], (initially standing and speaking off camera),</li>
<li>Michael Peskin [SLAC and Stanford University],</li>
<li>Nima Arkani-Hamed [Institute for Advanced Study],</li>
<li>Gavin Salam [CERN (the LHC lab), Paris and Princeton],</li>
<li>Me [Rutgers University],</li>
<li>Riccardo Rattazzi [Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne]</li>
</ul>
<p>Questions are asked off-camera by professor Patrick Meade of the State University of New York at Stonybrook. <em> (Meade, Sundrum and Michele Papucci of Berkeley organized the workshop.)</em></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a particle physicist, you&#8217;ll have no trouble following the panel, but for those of you who aren&#8217;t, I&#8217;m afraid this is a high-level discussion which often lapses into jargon (see the limited glossary below). And it can get a little slow, so I think it unlikely that many non-experts will want to listen to the whole thing. So let me give you a few pointers (in both senses of the word).</p>
<ul>
<li>The discussion is 1 hour 23 minutes long.</li>
<li>There are about two minutes of intro. Then from about 3:25 to 4:07 there&#8217;s a technical glitch which they didn&#8217;t edit out; skip til the video returns.</li>
<li>From there, Professor Peskin presents his <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/22/professor-peskins-four-slogans-advice-for-the-2012-lhc/" target="_blank">Four Slogans for 2012, which I described in an earlier post</a>; now you can see them for yourself, though the language is quite technical.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then the questions start (times listed):</p>
<ul>
<li>What would you personally most like the experimentalists at ATLAS and CMS <em>[the two general-purpose experiments at the LHC]</em> to look for in 2012? (0:09:00 &#8211; 0:30:00) <span style="color:#ff0000;">[fairly technical answers]</span></li>
<li>Do you think the excess seen at around a mass of 125 <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/" target="_blank">GeV</a>/c<sup>2</sup> in the search for the <a title="The Standard Model Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/" target="_blank">Standard Model Higgs particle</a> is really a Higgs? (0:30:00 &#8211; 0:35:00) <span style="color:#008000;">[less technical; </span><span style="color:#000000;"><em>this regards the hints in the data that I have written about <a title="Holiday Higgs Hints: Confidence-Inspiring or Not?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/holiday-higgs-hints-confidence-inspiring-or-not/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a title="Taking Stock: Where is the Higgs Search Now?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/07/taking-stock-where-is-the-higgs-search-now/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a title="The Quiet Higgs Quake at CMS" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/13/the-quiet-higgs-quake-at-cms/" target="_blank">here</a>.</em>]</span></li>
<li>Where do you think supersymmetry stands right now, given that no sign of superpartner particles were seen in 2011, and given that there might be a Standard-Model-like Higgs at 125 GeV/c<sup>2</sup>?(0:35:00 &#8211; 1:05:00) [<span style="color:#ff0000;">fairly technical</span>; <em>see <a title="Supersymmetry" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/" target="_blank">the articles linked from this one</a> for relevant background information, and <a title="Where Stands Supersymmetry (as of 4/2012)?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/where-stands-supersymmetry-as-of-42012/" target="_blank">this article</a> for my detailed answer to this question.</em>]</li>
<li>What is the one experimental result that would give you the most insight into BSM <em>(see glossary below)</em> physics? (1:05:00-1:11:00) [<span style="color:#ff0000;">fairly technical</span>]</li>
<li>What do you see as the role of theorists who think about BSM physics going into the coming year(s)? (1:14:00-end) [<span style="color:#008000;">less technical</span>]</li>
</ul>
<p>At a minimum I recommend non-experts listen to a little of what the brilliant, entertaining, and famously long-winded Nima Arkani-Hamed, of the Institute for Advanced Study, has to say; he&#8217;s larger than life and a lot of fun to watch. He waxes poetic a few times, and in some cases reviews moments in scientific history in an interesting way; see examples at 0:14:45, 0:40:00 [over ten minutes!], 1:14:55.</p>
<p><em>If you are curious about my own views, I suggest 0:20:00 (<a title="Exotic Decays of the Higgs: A High Priority for 2012" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/01/27/exotic-decays-of-the-higgs-a-high-priority-for-2012/" target="_blank">Higgs and 2012</a>), 0:32:00 (is there a Higgs particle appearing in current data?) and 1:20:00 (more general philosophy about doing physics at the LHC).</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes, it&#8217;s true what you&#8217;ve read; the CMS experiment at the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> has found a new particle.  However, this isn&#8217;t one to get excited about.  Or rather, it&#8217;s the particle that&#8217;s excited, not the rest of us.  It&#8217;s a nice result; a neat result; but this particle is a slightly more massive version of a <a title="What’s a Hadron?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-hadron-as-in-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">hadron</a> that we already knew about, a composite object similar to a <a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/" target="_blank">proton</a>, built out of <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">more fundamental particles</a> we discovered over 30 years ago.  So in the grand scheme of things, this is minor news; no big mysteries to resolve here.  Nevertheless, <strong>congratulations to CMS</strong>! Finding such particles always involves reconstructing them from their decay products, and since this one decays in a very complicated way, the result represents a technical tour-de-force!</p>
<p>This is a similar story to one from last December, when <a title="A New Particle at the LHC? Yes, But…" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/12/22/a-new-particle-at-the-lhc-yes-but/" target="_blank">ATLAS announced that it had found, with confidence, a new particle</a>.  I explained to you then that there are particles and there are particles;<span id="more-3476"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>there are <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/">(apparently)-fundamental particles such as top quarks, electrons, Z particles and neutrinos</a> <em>[&#8220;apparently&#8221; because someday we might learn they have a structure, but right now we know they&#8217;re smaller than a billionth of a billionth of a meter.]</em></li>
<li>there are composite particles that are built from smaller and apparently-fundamental particles; atoms are one class of examples; <a title="What’s a Hadron?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-hadron-as-in-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">hadrons</a>, particles built from quarks, antiquarks and gluons, are another. <em>[All hadrons have a size of about a millionth of a billionth of a meter.]</em></li>
</ul>
<p>As I explained carefully in December, <a title="A New Particle at the LHC? Yes, But…" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/12/22/a-new-particle-at-the-lhc-yes-but/" target="_blank">what ATLAS found was a hadron that is an excited state of a sort of &#8220;atom&#8221; made from a bottom quark and a bottom anti-quark.</a>  Since we found the bottom quark in the 1970s, this is very different indeed from finding, say, the Higgs particle, which would be <em>really</em> new.  <em>[That might happen soon, and certainly <a title="Holiday Higgs Hints: Confidence-Inspiring or Not?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/holiday-higgs-hints-confidence-inspiring-or-not/">we have hints that suggest discovery of the Higgs may be imminent</a>, but the <a title="The Quiet Higgs Quake at CMS" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/13/the-quiet-higgs-quake-at-cms/">evidence</a> is still, in my view, <a title="Taking Stock: Where is the Higgs Search Now?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/07/taking-stock-where-is-the-higgs-search-now/" target="_blank">pretty weak</a>.]</em></p>
<p>Now CMS has found, with high confidence (over 5 standard deviations above background), a hadron that is an excited state of something just a bit more complicated than what ATLAS found.  It contains <strong>a single bottom quark</strong>, a strange quark, and an up quark, along with a whole mess of gluons and quark/anti-quark pairs (as is the case for most hadrons).  <em>[Sometimes people still refer to the top and bottom quarks as &#8220;truth&#8221; and &#8220;beauty&#8221; quarks, which is why you&#8217;ll read people calling this a &#8220;beautiful hadron&#8221; or a &#8220;beauty particle&#8221;.  It makes for good puns.]</em></p>

<p>This is to be compared with a proton, which has two up quarks, a down quark, and a whole mess of gluons and quark/anti-quark pairs.  The class of hadrons that have three quarks plus gluons plus quark/anti-quark pairs are called baryons; the proton is the lightest one, with a mass of 0.938 <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/" target="_blank">GeV</a>/c<sup>2</sup>, but there are hundreds and hundreds of them.  This one is called (tentatively, needing verification) the Ξ*<sub>b</sub><sup>0</sup>; it is electrically neutral (like a neutron) and has a mass of about 5.945 GeV/c<sup>2</sup> <em>[with an uncertainty of about 0.003 GeV/c<sup>2</sup>]</em>. The main differences between the newbie and the proton is that</p>
<ul>
<li>the bottom quark is so heavy that it makes up, by itself, most of the mass of this hadron; and it sits dead center and barely moves while all the other quarks and gluons and anti-quarks whiz around it</li>
<li>the new particle has its quarks and gluons moving around with more energy than necessary <em>(this is what it means to be &#8220;excited&#8221; &#8212; it is the same notion as for an <a title="A New Particle at the LHC?

<li>the new particle decays within a trillionth of a trillionth of a second or so, cascading down in several steps to particles that live long enough to be measured in CMS&#8217;s electronic tracking devices.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a follow-up especially aimed at those non-experts who got really excited by my recent posts on the internal structure of<a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/"> the proton</a> (<a title="Proton Collisions Vs. Quark/Gluon/Antiquark Mini-Collisions" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/proton-collisions-vs-quarkgluonantiquark-mini-collisions/">here</a>, <a title="A Few More Facts About Protons" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/02/15/a-few-more-facts-about-protons/">here</a> and <a title="How Do We KNOW a Proton Is So Complicated? (Data!)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/02/17/how-do-we-know-a-proton-is-so-complicated-data/">here</a>), in which I described the proton as being a lot more complicated than just two up quarks and a down quark, emphasizing the presence of many gluons and of many quark/anti-quark pairs in addition to those three quarks that everyone talks about.</p>
<p>Following those posts, I got a lot of very good questions. I&#8217;ve been absorbing them and thinking about how to answer them effectively.  I had taken you as far as I knew how to go without hitting technical barriers. You probably noticed I was very careful to address certain issues and not others &#8212; answering certain questions and avoiding others. And many of you, intelligently, asked the questions I didn&#8217;t answer. So now you get to find out why I didn&#8217;t answer them in the first place.  [You asked!]  <span id="more-2838"></span>You&#8217;ll also note there are no pictures.  In a couple of cases, that&#8217;s due to lack of time.  But mostly, it&#8217;s because we&#8217;re going beyond where pictures can convey the reality.</p>
<p>So fasten your belts, and be prepared for the possibility that you may not entirely like the answers.</p>
<p>In most cases the answer to the questions you&#8217;ve been asking involves coming to grips with something weird about quantum mechanics. Describing reality becomes a lot harder when we are forced to come face-to-face with the fact that our reality is quantum in nature.  Even those of us who <strong>do</strong> know quantum mechanics very well cannot form a clear intuitive picture of it. We can only learn how to <em>calculate</em> what quantum mechanical systems do, and how to get intuition for <em>how</em> quantum mechanical systems will work. But <em>why</em> they work that way?  Sorry.   Our minds just don&#8217;t form a picture of the world that corresponds to how the world really behaves. To quote Richard Feynman: &#8220;I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of the questions you asked don&#8217;t make sense in a quantum world. They have no answers; you are simply not able to ask them, any more than you can ask, say, <em>how much does a the sound of a piano weigh?</em> On top of that, protons are sufficiently complicated that even for some of the questions that we should be able to answer, the answers are either not known or are so complicated that I don&#8217;t have a good answer for you.</p>
<p>Anyway, here are some of the questions you asked, and some of the answers, as best as I can give you.  We&#8217;ll start with two simpler ones before it gets murky.</p>
<p><strong>Why don&#8217;t the quarks or gluons hit each other inside the proton and make a Higgs particle sometimes?</strong></p>
<p>They don&#8217;t have enough energy, relative to one another. You need a collision that has a lot of energy to make a Higgs particle: 125 <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/">GeV</a> or so. The typical energies of the objects inside a proton are a small fraction of a proton&#8217;s mass-energy, about 1 GeV, so when they hit each other the total energy in that collision is far less than the mass-energy of a Higgs particle. Only by accelerating two protons and having them hit each other head on can you arrange that the energy of a collision of a gluon from one proton with a gluon in the other proton has energy far above 1 GeV, and potentially enough to make a Higgs particle. You can&#8217;t do it within one proton.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very roughly the same reason that two cars that hit head on will make a horrible mess of each other, but a single car can&#8217;t just do that to itself.</p>
<p><strong>Given that a proton is a big mess of quarks, anti-quarks and gluons, is a nucleus, made from protons and neutrons, really to be thought of as a simple collection of protons and neutrons? or is it just as big a mess of quarks and antiquarks and gluons as protons are?  </strong></p>
<p>You can think of it as protons and neutrons.  While the quarks and gluons and anti-quarks are tightly bound inside protons and neutrons, and rush furiously about, the atomic nucleus is a much more fragile object, made from protons and neutrons loosely bound together. The protons and neutrons inside a nucleus remain largely distinguishable. This loose binding is why nuclear fission occurs so easily with some nuclei: it just takes a rather low-energy neutron to break a nucleus apart, much like a pile of beach balls stuck together with cheap glue could be broken apart by another beach ball crashing into them.</p>
<p>Another hint that this is the case is that the radius of a nucleus grows roughly as the one-third power of the number <em><strong>A</strong></em> of protons and neutrons that it contains. That is just you would expect if you tried to gather<em> <strong>A </strong></em>beach balls into a somewhat spherical shape without deforming them very much.</p>
<p>That said, it&#8217;s not entirely boring in the nucleus. The process <em>proton + neutron → neutron + proton</em>, in which an up quark moves from a proton to a neutron while a down quark simultaneously moves from a neutron to a proton (or a down antiquark moves from the proton to the neutron, which is basically indistinguishable), happens regularly, and is indeed one of the processes that generates the forces that helps keep a nucleus together.  <em>This process is central in explaining why neutrons are necessary to make a stable nucleus. In fact, it&#8217;s not an accident that roughly equal numbers of neutrons and protons give you something relatively stable.  </em>And these forces that hold the protons and neutrons together have to be <em>moderately</em> strong, since ordinary electric forces (which are rather weak, by comparison with the strong nuclear force) are trying their best to push the protons away from each other and blow the nucleus apart.</p>
<p><em>This last point helps explain why for larger nuclei the number of neutrons is bigger than the number of protons. </em>  <em>Without the proton&#8217;s electric charge the ideal situation would be to have equal numbers of each, but given that the proton does have an electric charge, the energy cost of putting another proton into an already electrically-charged nucleus is high, so on average it turns out to be less costly, if you want to make a bigger nucleus, to put a neutron in instead.</em></p>
<p><strong>How many quark and antiquark pairs are there in a proton?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>You notice that I did not attempt to address this in my articles. That&#8217;s because this number cannot be specified. First, the number is constantly changing [or, in quantum mechanics language, constantly <em>fluctuating &#8212; </em>meaning that if you were to measure it many times, you would get a different answer each time]. And second, even the average number of pairs will depend on exactly what question you ask.</p>
<p><strong>Is the large number of quarks and antiquarks fixed, or does it vary from baryon to baryon?</strong></p>
<p><em>[A baryon is any <a title="What’s a Hadron?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-hadron-as-in-large-hadron-collider/">hadron</a> like a <a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/">proton</a>, in that it contains three quarks, many gluons, and many quark/anti-quark pairs.  But there are many types of baryons.  In general the three extra quarks may be of different types from those found in the proton, and the whole system may have its energy distributed differently than is the case for a proton.]</em></p>
<p>Well, the answer depends on exactly what you meant by your question.</p>
<p>The number of quarks and anti-quarks is always changing &#8212; and also hard to define clearly &#8212; yet however you choose to define it, the average number of quarks and antiquarks of any particular type, and the degree to which that number fluctuates, is the same in every proton. All protons are exactly identical in any measurable intrinsic property.</p>
<p>One baryon which is extremely similar to a proton is a neutron; they&#8217;re almost twins, except for the exchange of an up quark for a down quark.</p>
<p>If by other baryons you want to include, say, the Omega baryon, or the Lambda baryon, or one of the many others, then no, the properties of the quark/anti-quark pairs are not exactly the same as for the proton, though they don&#8217;t differ very much. The basic processes which lead to the existence of those quark and anti-quark pairs are always the same, but the details of what makes the baryon a Sigma or an Omega rather than a proton do affect the details of the quark/anti-quark pairs.</p>
<p><strong>What about the hadrons that have <span style="color:#800000;">equal</span> numbers of quarks and anti-quarks, such as the neutral pion?  How can we tell the difference between a neutral pion and the vacuum of empty space? Or between a pion and another such hadron, say, the eta, which also has equal numbers?</strong></p>
<p>The answer involves quantum mechanics, which is why I sidestepped the issue in my presentation. To keep the discussion simple, let&#8217;s just limit ourselves to up quarks and up anti-quarks and down quarks and down anti-quarks.   Really we should at least include strange quarks too, but that will clutter the discussion without changing the conceptual point.</p>
<p>Our non-quantum mindset would tell us that if we were handed an electrically-neutral quark-antiquark pair, it would have to be either (a) an up quark  <span style="color:#800000;">u</span>  and an up anti-quark  <span style="text-decoration:overline;color:#800000;">u</span>  or  (b) a down quark  <span style="color:#800000;">d</span>  and a down antiquark  <span style="text-decoration:overline;color:#800000;">d</span>. But in our quantum mechanical world, it&#8217;s actually more complicated.</p>
<p>First &#8212; a little weird &#8212; in a quantum world I can have in my hand either <span style="color:#800000;">u<span style="text-decoration:overline;">u</span></span> or <span style="color:#800000;">d<span style="text-decoration:overline;">d</span></span> with certain probabilities, where the probabilities sum up to 100%.  To be specific, I could be holding something that has 50% probability to be an up quark/anti-quark pair and 50% probability to be a down quark/anti-quark pair.</p>
<p>But I am afraid it gets much weirder. There are actually multiple ways to have this 50% probability for  u<span style="text-decoration:overline;">u</span>  and 50% probability for  d<span style="text-decoration:overline;">d</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li>One of them can be written (u <span style="text-decoration:overline;">u</span> <strong>+</strong> d <span style="text-decoration:overline;">d</span>).</li>
<li>Another one (the relevant one here) can be written (u <span style="text-decoration:overline;">u</span> <strong>&#8211;</strong> d <span style="text-decoration:overline;">d</span>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>These are not the same.</strong>  And there is <em>nothing</em> you can do about the fact that the difference between them has no intuitive analogue. It is a property of quantum mechanics that <strong><em>these are two different ways to have 50% probability to have an up quark/anti-quark pair and 50% probability to have a down quark/anti-quark pair.</em></strong></p>
<p>In a neutral pion, almost all of the quark/anti-quark pairs are in a configuration that is best described as (u <span style="text-decoration:overline;">u</span> + d <span style="text-decoration:overline;">d</span>). But crudely, there is one pair in the configuration (u <span style="text-decoration:overline;">u</span> &#8211; d <span style="text-decoration:overline;">d</span>). <strong><em>That is </em></strong><em>(partly)</em><strong><em> what makes this hadron a neutral pion.</em></strong></p>
<p>A positively charged pion isn&#8217;t very different. There, almost all of the quark/anti-quark pairs are in a configuration that is best described as (u <span style="text-decoration:overline;">u</span> + d <span style="text-decoration:overline;">d</span>). But then there is one extra up quark and one extra down antiquark, in the configuration u <span style="text-decoration:overline;">d</span>.</p>
<p>And a negatively charged pion has one quark/anti-quark pair in the configuration <span style="text-decoration:overline;">u</span> d.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;ve cheated you slightly, because some of the quark-antiquark pairs in the proton are strange quarks. If we include them, then roughly speaking the quark-antiquark pairs in the proton are typically of the form (u <span style="text-decoration:overline;">u</span> + d <span style="text-decoration:overline;">d</span> + s <span style="text-decoration:overline;">s</span>). And what makes an eta meson is that one of its quark-antiquark pairs is instead roughly arranged as (- u <span style="text-decoration:overline;">u</span> &#8211; d <span style="text-decoration:overline;">d</span> + 2 s <span style="text-decoration:overline;">s</span>).  <em>[I say &#8220;roughly&#8221; here because the numbers actually get modified slightly, as a result of the fact that the strange quark&#8217;s mass quite a bit larger than that of the up and down quarks. But that&#8217;s a detail.]</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;m still badly oversimplifying. A further problem with characterizing the issue in this way is that all up quarks are identical&#8230; so you can&#8217;t say <em><strong>which</strong></em> of the up quarks is in the special configuration. Accounting for this makes the conversation about the pion even more complicated. <em>There&#8217;s an analogue here: in a Lithium atom, there are three electrons, two in the inner shell and one in the outer shell. But actually you can&#8217;t say, in quantum mechanics, which of the three electrons is which. For instance, there&#8217;s no way for you to grab the one in the outer shell, color it green, and check later whether it is still in the outer shell or whether it has changed places with one of the inner electrons. You can&#8217;t color it, or mark it in any way, to make it different from the other two.  It&#8217;s as impossible as trying to say, when two waves on the ocean pass through and/or bounce off each other, which of the two waves is which.</em></p>
<p>Oh, and I&#8217;m afraid there are hadrons whose quark/anti-quark pairs are <em>all</em> arranged as (u <span style="text-decoration:overline;">u</span> + d <span style="text-decoration:overline;">d</span>). Such hadrons are all very unstable so you don&#8217;t hear much about them, but the lightest of them used to be called the σ, and is now usually called the f<sub>0</sub>. So clearly there&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve left out of the story.</p>
<p>Actually, there&#8217;s a lot that I&#8217;ve left out.  But some of it is in the answer to the next question.</p>
<p><strong>Are the quark/anti-quark pairs inside the proton a part of the proton or part of the vacuum of space, which also has quark/anti-quark pairs?</strong></p>
<p>The answer is that the quark/anti-quark pairs that I referred to in my posts are part of the proton: crudely speaking, if I make a proton move, the quark/anti-quark pairs that are a part of the proton will move with it, while those that are part of the vacuum will not.</p>
<p>The main distinction between the types of quark/anti-quark pairs is, however, quantum mechanical.  A quark/anti-quark pair that appears in the vacuum does not generate a strong gluon field, while those that are part of the proton typically do contribute to the strong gluon fields inside the proton.  Why?</p>
<p>Well,  not all quark/anti-quark pairs that you would naively think are the same actually <em><strong>are</strong></em> the same.  The issue is similar to what came up in the answer to the previous question.  There I pointed out that there are ways to arrange an up or down quark/anti-quark pair that  a non-quantum thinker wouldn&#8217;t imagine were possible.  It turns out there&#8217;s even if you just have an up quark and an up anti-quark, there are different arrangements possible.  Most of these arrangements generate a strong gluon field (also called a &#8220;chromo-electric&#8221; field, in analogy to the electric [i.e. photon] field created by an electron.)   But one of them &#8212; the arrangement you most often find in the vacuum &#8212; doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a little bit (but not precisely) analogous to why two electrons placed next to each other will generate an electric (i.e. photon) field that you can feel far away, but an electron and a positron placed very near each other don&#8217;t do that.  This is because the electric fields from the electron and positron are <strong>equal and opposite</strong>,<strong> and mostly cancel</strong> far away, while those from the two electrons are almost <strong>identical and add together</strong>.  It turns out it is possible to arrange a quark and an anti-quark so that their &#8220;chromo-electric&#8221; (i.e. gluon) fields <strong>either cancel or add together</strong> &#8212; a feature not possible for an electron/positron pair.  The pairs in the proton mostly have fields that add; those in the vacuum have fields that cancel.</p>
<p>Another way to say this is that there is a sense in which most quark/anti-quark pairs in the proton are borderline-&#8220;virtual particles&#8221; (which aren&#8217;t really particles, but are more general disturbances in the quark fields) generated by <em><strong>gluons</strong></em>.   (See Figure 5 of <a title="Virtual Particles: What are they?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/virtual-particles-what-are-they/">my virtual particle article</a>, which shows the same thing for electron/positron pairs and photons.) I&#8217;ll say a bit more about this in the answer to the next question.  Most of the quark-antiquark pairs in the vacuum are just spontaneous disturbances of the quark fields that happen <strong><em>on their own</em></strong>, and for such pairs their chromo-electric fields cancel.</p>
<p><strong>Is there not perhaps some sense in which the proton should be thought of as three quarks, with all the gluons and quark-antiquark pairs being just an artifact, or an effect, of having accelerated the proton to high speed?</strong></p>
<p>Well, although I have argued against this in my posts, and given you strong reasons, I should still tell you that actually there <em>almost</em> is such a sense, and this is part of why the issue of the proton&#8217;s structure has been debated for so long.  I don&#8217;t think this is the right way to think about the problem, but I cannot promise you 100% that I&#8217;m right, and so, in fairness, I should present the dissenting minority view.</p>
<p>First you should read <a title="Virtual Particles: What are they?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/virtual-particles-what-are-they/">what I wrote about virtual particles here</a>. (In particular, they&#8217;re not really particles at all.)</p>
<p>It is often useful in technical calculations to think of the quark/anti-quark pairs <a title="Virtual Particles: What are they?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/virtual-particles-what-are-they/">as virtual particles</a> &#8212; which are not particles at all, but fluctuations in the quark fields &#8212; associated with gluons (<a title="Virtual Particles: What are they?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/virtual-particles-what-are-they/">analogous to  fluctuations in the electron field associated with photons &#8212; see Figures 5 and 6 of this article</a>), and then to think of the gluons as fluctuations in the gluon field created in the vicinity of quarks (<a title="Virtual Particles: What are they?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/virtual-particles-what-are-they/">the way electrons create disturbances in the photon [i.e., electromagnetic] field &#8212; see Figures 3 and 4 of this article</a>.).</p>
<p>One might try to take this <em>technical</em> point to be a <em>physical</em> one, and suggest that all the quark/anti-quark pairs and the gluons arise as virtual particles associated to one of the three quarks intrinsic to the proton.</p>
<p>But as I&#8217;ve emphasized in earlier posts and answers to comments, it isn&#8217;t really meaningful to establish a clear difference between virtual particles (which aren&#8217;t particles) and real particles (which are nicely behaved ripples in a quantum field) when you&#8217;re trying to understand something as complicated as a proton&#8217;s interior.</p>
<p>In any case, it turns out that it is hard to get this line of thinking to work for all of the  gluons, but you might get away with thinking about the quark/anti-quark pairs this way.  I can&#8217;t tell you this is entirely excluded, because theorists cannot calculate the proton&#8217;s interior well enough to be sure such a picture is false.  Nor is there any clarifying measurement you could make to check whether this picture made sense.  So you should view this as an unsettled point, a caveat to <a title="How Do We KNOW a Proton Is So Complicated? (Data!)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/02/17/how-do-we-know-a-proton-is-so-complicated-data/">the article I wrote giving you evidence that the proton&#8217;s interior is complicated</a>.</p>
<p>However, even if the minority view turned out to be (at least in some sense) right, my main point for you still would stand: that you <strong>have</strong> to think about the gluons and quark/anti-quark pairs inside the proton &#8212; whatever their origin &#8212; in order to understand anything about <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC] physics.  At the LHC (or even many earlier experiments) there&#8217;s no point in worrying about whether you can or can&#8217;t someday find some way of thinking about the proton as only three quarks.  Any physics you do at the LHC will involve the gluons and the quark/anti-quark pairs in a big way; nothing of any interest arises merely from those three quarks of lore.</p>
<p><strong>Could you perhaps explain the QCD vacuum?</strong></p>
<p>No.  Not now, not yet at least. It&#8217;s one of the most complicated things in particle physics.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Among the bridges that I hope to build, as I develop this website, is one connecting <strong>what we know</strong> today about nature with <strong>how we know it</strong>. After all, you&#8217;re reading my depiction of nature, based on how I think nature works.  I can try to assure you that my depiction is the mainstream viewpoint at the forefront of the research field &#8212; but you may still wonder if this website is legitimate, or if I might just be full of hot air, or if I might simply be mistaken. Well, my confidence in what I&#8217;m saying doesn&#8217;t come from having trained at some fancy university or my degree or from having been in the business for over 20 years. It comes <strong><em>from the data</em></strong>&#8230; in short, from nature itself.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s important, I think, to link the data to the ideas and concepts, when it&#8217;s possible to do that.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve heard the famous statement that &#8220;a proton is made from two up quarks and a down quark&#8221;.  But in <a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/">this basic article</a>, and <a title="Proton Collisions Vs. Quark/Gluon/Antiquark Mini-Collisions" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/proton-collisions-vs-quarkgluonantiquark-mini-collisions/">this somewhat more advanced one</a>, and <a title="A Few More Facts About Protons" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/02/15/a-few-more-facts-about-protons/">in Wednesday&#8217;s post where I went into some details about what we know about proton structure</a>, I&#8217;ve claimed to you that protons are actually chock full of particles, most of which carry a tiny fraction of the proton&#8217;s energy, and most of which are gluons, with a lot of quarks and antiquarks. <em>[If this sounds unfamiliar, you should read those articles and posts before reading this one, which is a follow-up.]  </em>And I claimed that these complications make a big difference at the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC].</p>
<p>So should you take my word for this? You don&#8217;t have to.  Let me show you evidence.  From LHC data.  <a title="Checking What’s Inside a Proton" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/checking-whats-inside-a-proton/">Here&#8217;s an article defending the main claim&#8217;s of Wednesday&#8217;s post.</a>  It&#8217;s a near-final draft, still needing some proofreading perhaps, and probably some clarification, but I think it is fully readable now.  Enjoy it (and please feel free to give me feedback on its clarity, so I can improve it), or wait for the final version next week, as you see fit.  And have a great weekend!</p>
