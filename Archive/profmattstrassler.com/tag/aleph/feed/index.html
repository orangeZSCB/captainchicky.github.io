										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>UPDATE 10/26: In the original version of this post, I stupidly forgot to include an effect, causing an error of a factor of about 5 in one of my estimates below. I had originally suggested that a recent result using ALEPH data was probably more powerful than a recent CMS result.  But once the error is corrected, the two experiments appear have comparable sensitivity. However, I was very conservative in my analysis of ALEPH, and my guess concerning CMS has a big uncertainty band &#8212; so it might go either way.  It&#8217;s up to ALEPH experts and CMS experts to show us who really wins the day.  Added reasoning and discussion marked in green below.</strong></span></p>
<p>In <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2016/10/21/hiding-from-a-nightmare/">Friday&#8217;s post</a>, I highlighted the importance of looking for low-mass particles whose interactions with known particles are very weak. I referred to a recent preprint in which an experimental physicist, Dr. Arno Heister, reanalyzed ALEPH data in such a search.</p>
<p>A few hours later, Harvard Professor Matt Reece pointed me to a paper that appeared <strong>just two weeks ago:</strong> a very interesting <a href="http://cms-results.web.cern.ch/cms-results/public-results/preliminary-results/HIG-15-009/index.html">CMS analysis of 2011-2012 data that did a search of this type</a> &#8212; although it appears that CMS <em>[one of the two general purpose detectors at the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">Large Hadron Collider</a> (LHC)]</em> didn&#8217;t think of it that way.</p>
<p>The title of the paper is obscure:  &#8220;<em>Search for a light pseudo–scalar Higgs boson produced in association with bottom quarks in pp collisions at 8 TeV</em>&#8220;.  Such spin-zero &#8220;pseudo-scalar&#8221; particles, which often arise in speculative models with more than one Higgs particle, usually decay to bottom quark/anti-quark pairs or tau/anti-tau pairs.  But they can have a <strong>very rare</strong> decay to muon/anti-muon, which is much easier to measure. The title of the paper gives no indication that the muon/anti-muon channel is the target of the search; you have to read the abstract. Shouldn&#8217;t the words &#8220;in the dimuon channel&#8221; or &#8220;dimuon resonance&#8221; appear in the title?  That would help researchers who are interested in dimuons, but not in pseudo-scalars, find the paper.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the main result of the paper:</p>
<p><a href="http://cms-results.web.cern.ch/cms-results/public-results/preliminary-results/HIG-15-009/CMS-PAS-HIG-15-009_Figure_005.png"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/cms-results.web.cern.ch/cms-results/public-results/preliminary-results/HIG-15-009/CMS-PAS-HIG-15-009_Figure_005.png" style="max-width:100%;" /></a></p>
<p>At left is shown a plot of the number of events as a function of the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-invariant-mass/">invariant mass</a> of the muon/anti-muon pairs.  CMS data is in black dots; estimated background is shown in the upper curve (with top quark backgrounds in the lower curve); and the peak at bottom shows what a simulated particle decaying to muon/anti-muon with a mass of 30 GeV/c² would look like. (Imagine sticking the peak on top of the upper curve to see how a signal would affect the data points).  At right are the resulting limits on the rate for such a resonance to be produced and then decay to muon/anti-muon, <em><strong>if it is radiated off of a bottom quark. [</strong></em><em>A limit of 100 femtobarns means that at most two thousand collisions of this type could have occurred during the year 2012.  But note that only about 1 in 100 of these collisions would have been observed, due to the difficulty of <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/the-trigger-discarding-all-but-the-gold/">triggering on these collisions</a> and some other challenges.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Note also the restriction of the mass of the dimuon pair to the range 25 GeV to 60 GeV. This may have done purely been for technical reasons, but if it was due to the theoretical assumptions, that restriction should be lifted.]</em></p>
<p>While this plot places moderate limits on <strong>spin-zero</strong> particles produced with a bottom quark, it&#8217;s equally interesting, at least to me, in other contexts. Specifically, it puts limits on any light <strong>spin-one</strong> particle (call it V) that mixes (either via kinetic or mass mixing) with the photon and Z and often comes along with at least one bottom quark&#8230; because <strong>for such particles the rate to decay to muons is <span style="color:#ff0000;">not</span> rare</strong>.  This is very interesting for hidden valley models specifically; as I mentioned on Friday, new spin-one and spin-zero particles often are produced together, giving a muon/anti-muon pair along with one or more bottom quark/anti-quark pairs.</p>
<p>But CMS interpreted its measurement only in terms of <strong><em>radiation of a new particle off a bottom quar</em>k</strong>.  Now, what if a V particle decaying sometimes to muon/anti-muon were produced in a <strong>Z particle decay</strong> <span style="color:#999999;"><em>(a possibility alluded to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0604261">already in 2006</a>).</em></span>  For a different production process, the angles and energies of the particles would be different, and since many events would be lost (due to triggering, transverse momentum cuts, and b-tagging inefficiencies at low transverse momentum) the limits would have to be fully recalculated by the experimenters.  It would be great if CMS could add such an analysis before they publish this paper.</p>
<p>Still, we can make a rough back-of-the-envelope estimate, with big caveats. The LHC produced about 600 million Z particles at CMS in 2012. The plot at right tells us that if the V were radiated off a bottom quark, the maximum number of produced V&#8217;s decaying to muons would be about 2000 to 8000, depending on the V mass.  Now if we could take those numbers directly, we&#8217;d conclude that the fraction of Z&#8217;s that could decay to muon/anti-muon plus bottom quarks in this way would be 3 to 12 per million. But sensitivity of this search to a Z decay to V is probably much less than for a V radiated off bottom quarks <em>[because (depending on the V mass) either the bottom quarks in the Z decay would be less energetic and more difficult to tag, or the muons are less energetic on average, or both.]</em> So I&#8217;m guessing that the limits on Z decays to V are always worse than one per hundred thousand, for any V mass.  <em>(Thanks to Wei Xue for catching an error as I was finalizing my estimate.)  </em></p>
<p>If that guess/estimate is correct, then the CMS search <strong>does not</strong> rule out the possibility of a hundred or so Z decays to V particles at each of the various LEP experiments.  That said, old LEP searches might rule this possibility out; if anyone knows of such a search, please comment or contact me.</p>
<p>As for whether Heister&#8217;s analysis of the ALEPH experiment&#8217;s data shows signs of such a signal, I think it unlikely (though some people seemed to read my post as saying the opposite.)  <strong>As I pointed out in Friday&#8217;s post</strong>, not only is the excess too small for excitement on its own, it also is somewhat too wide and its angular correlations look like the background <em>(which comes, of course, from bottom quarks that decay to charm quarks plus a muon and neutrino.)</em>  The point of Friday&#8217;s post, and of today&#8217;s, is that <strong>we should be looking</strong>.</p>
<p>In fact, because of Heister&#8217;s work <em>(which, by the way, is his own, not endorsed by the ALEPH collaboration)</em>, we can draw interesting if rough conclusions.  Ignore for now the bump at 30 GeV/c²; that&#8217;s more controversial.  What about the <strong>absence</strong> of a bump between 35 and 50 GeV/c²? Unless there are subtleties with his analysis that I don&#8217;t understand, we learn that at ALEPH there were fewer than ten Z decays to a V particle (plus a source of bottom quarks) for V in this mass range.  <del>That limits such Z decays to about 2 to 3 per million.</del>  <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>OOPS: Dumb mistake!! At this step, I forgot to include the fact that requiring bottom quarks in the ALEPH events only works about 20% of the time <em>(thanks to Imperial College Professor Oliver Buchmuller for questioning my reasoning!)</em> The real number is therefore about 5 times larger, more like 10 to 15 per million.</strong></span> If that rough estimate is correct, it would provide a <del>more powerful constraint than</del> <span style="color:#008000;">constraint roughly comparable to</span> the current CMS analysis.</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;"><em>[[BUT: In my original argument I was very conservative.  When I said &#8220;fewer than 10&#8221;, I was trying to be brief; really, looking at the invariant mass plot, the allowed numbers of excess events for a V with mass above 36 GeV is typically fewer than 7 or even 5.  And that doesn&#8217;t include any angular information, which for many signals would reduce the numbers to 3.   Including these effects properly brings the ALEPH bound back down to something close to my initial estimate.  Anyway, it&#8217;s clear that CMS is nipping at ALEPH&#8217;s heels, but I&#8217;m still betting they haven&#8217;t passed ALEPH &#8212; yet.]]</em></span></p>
<p>So my advice would be to set Heister&#8217;s bump aside and instead <strong>focus on the constraints that one can obtain, and the potential discoveries that one <span style="color:#ff0000;">could</span> make, with this type of analysis, either at LEP or at LHC.</strong> That&#8217;s where I think the real lesson lies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This summer there was a blog post from <span class="fn"><a class="g-profile" title="author profile" href="https://plus.google.com/111136225362929878171" rel="author">Sabine Hossenfelder</a></span>  claiming that &#8220;<a href="http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2016/08/the-lhc-nightmare-scenario-has-come-true.html">The LHC `nightmare scenario&#8217; has come true</a>&#8221; &#8212; implying that the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC] has found nothing but a <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/">Standard Model Higgs particle</a> (the simplest possible type), and will find nothing more of great importance. With all due respect for the considerable intelligence and technical ability of the author of that post, I could not disagree more; not only are we not in a nightmare, it isn&#8217;t even night-time yet, and hardly time for sleep or even daydreaming. There&#8217;s a tremendous amount of work to do, and there may be many hidden discoveries yet to be made, lurking in existing LHC data.  Or elsewhere.</p>
<p>I can defend this claim (and have done so as recently as this month; here are <a href="https://indico.bnl.gov/getFile.py/access?contribId=19&amp;sessionId=6&amp;resId=0&amp;materialId=slides&amp;confId=1516">my slides</a>). But there&#8217;s evidence from another quarter that it is far too early for such pessimism.  It has appeared in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06536">a new paper</a> (a preprint, so not yet peer-reviewed) by an experimentalist named Arno Heister, who is evaluating 20-year old data from the experiment known as <a href="https://home.cern/about/experiments/aleph">ALEPH</a>.</p>
<p>In the early 1990s the Large Electron-Positron (LEP) collider at CERN, in the same tunnel that now houses the LHC, produced nearly 4 million Z particles at the center of ALEPH; the Z&#8217;s decayed immediately into other particles, and ALEPH was used to observe those decays.  Of course the data was studied in great detail, and you might think there couldn&#8217;t possibly be anything still left to find in that data, after over 20 years. But a hidden gem wouldn&#8217;t surprise those of us who have worked in this subject for a long time &#8212; especially those of us who have worked on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0604261">hidden valleys</a>. <em>(Hidden Valleys are theories with a set of new forces and low-mass particles, which, because they aren&#8217;t affected by the known forces excepting gravity, interact very weakly with the known particles.  They are also often called &#8220;dark sectors&#8221; if they have something to do with dark matter.)</em></p>
<p>For some reason most experimenters in particle physics don&#8217;t tend to look for things just because they can; they stick to signals that theorists have already predicted. Since hidden valleys only hit the market in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0604261">a 2006 paper I wrote with then-student Kathryn Zurek</a>, long after the experimenters at ALEPH had moved on to other experiments, nobody went back to look in ALEPH or other LEP data for hidden valley phenomena (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1003.0705">with one exception</a>.) I didn&#8217;t expect anyone to ever do so; it&#8217;s a lot of work to dig up and recommission old computer files.</p>
<p>This wouldn&#8217;t have been a problem if the big LHC experiments (ATLAS, CMS and LHCb) had looked extensively for the sorts of particles expected in hidden valleys. ATLAS and CMS especially have many advantages; for instance, the LHC has made over a hundred times more Z particles than LEP ever did. But despite specific proposals for what to look for (and <a href="http://indico.cern.ch/event/46250/">a decade of pleading</a>), only a few limited searches have been carried out, mostly for very long-lived particles, for particles with mass of a few GeV/c² or less, and for particles produced in unexpected Higgs decays. And that means that, yes, hidden physics could certainly still be found in old ALEPH data, and in other old experiments. Kudos to Dr. Heister for taking a look.<span id="more-8706"></span></p>
<p>Now, has he actually <strong>found</strong> something hidden at ALEPH? It&#8217;s far too early to say. Dr. Heister is careful not to make a strong claim: his paper refers to an observed excess, not to the discovery of or even evidence for anything. But his analysis can be interpreted as showing a hint of a new particle (let&#8217;s call it the <strong>V particle</strong>, just to have a name for it) decaying sometimes to a muon and an anti-muon, and probably also sometimes to an electron and an anti-electron, with a rest mass about 1/3 of that of the Z particle &#8212; about 30 <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/">GeV</a>/c². Here&#8217;s one of the plots from his paper, showing the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-invariant-mass/">invariant mass</a> of the muon and anti-muon in Z decays that also have evidence of a bottom quark and a bottom anti-quark (each one giving a <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/jets-the-manifestation-of-quarks-and-gluons/">jet of hadrons</a> that has been &#8220;<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/jets-the-manifestation-of-quarks-and-gluons/b-tagging-identifying-jets-from-bottom-quarks/">b-tagged</a>&#8221;).  There&#8217;s an excess at about 30 GeV.</p>

<p>The simplest physical effect that would produce such a bump is a new particle; indeed this is how the Z particle itself was identified, over three decades ago.</p>
<p>However, the statistical significance of the bump is still only (after <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/08/28/nature-is-full-of-surprises/">look-elsewhere effect</a>) at most 3 standard deviations, according to the paper. So this bump could just be a fluke; we&#8217;ve seen similar ones disappear with more data, for example <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/04/20/dark-matter-now-you-see-it-now-you-dont/">this one</a>. There are also a couple of serious issues that will give experts pause <em>(the width of the bump is surprisingly large; the angular correlations seem consistent with background rather than a new signal; etc.)</em> So the data itself is not enough to convince anyone, including Dr. Heister, though it is certainly interesting.</p>
<p>Conversely it is intriguing that the bump in the plot above is observed in events with bottom quarks. It is common for hidden valleys <em>(including everything from a simple abelian Higgs models to more complex confining models)</em> to contain</p>
<ul>
<li>at least one spin-one particle V (which can decay to muon/anti-muon or electron/positron) and</li>
<li>at least one spin-zero particle S (which can decay to bottom/anti-bottom preferentially, with occasional decays to tau/anti-tau.)</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, in such models, a rare decay such as Z  ⇒ V + S, producing a muon/anti-muon pair plus two bottom quark/anti-quark <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/jets-the-manifestation-of-quarks-and-gluons/">jets</a>, would often be a possibility.*</p>
<p>*<span style="color:#808080;"><em>[In this case the bottom and anti-bottom jets would themselves show a peak in their invariant mass, but unfortunately their distribution in the presence of a candidate V was not shown. One other obvious prediction of such a model is a handful of striking Z ⇒ V + S ⇒ muon/anti-muon + tau/anti-tau events; but the expected number is very small and somewhat model-dependent.]</em></span></p>
<p>Another possibility (also common in hidden valleys) is that the bottom-tagged jets aren&#8217;t actually from real bottom quarks, and are instead fake bottom jets generated by one or two new long-lived hidden valley particles.</p>
<p>But clearly, before anyone gets excited, far more evidence is required. We&#8217;ll need to see similar studies done at one or more of the three other experiments that ran concurrently with ALEPH &#8212; L3, OPAL, and DELPHI. And of course ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb will surely take a look in their own data; for instance, ATLAS and CMS could search for a dilepton resonance in events with at least two bottom-tagged jets, where the whole system of bottom-tagged jets and dileptons has a invariant mass not greater than about 100 GeV/c². <em><span style="color:#ff0000;">[[IMPORTANT NOTE ADDED: It has been pointed out to me (thanks Matt Reece) that there was <a href="http://cds.cern.ch/record/2223864?ln=en">a relevant CMS search</a> from 2015 that had somehow entirely escaped my attention, in which <strong>one</strong> b-tag was required and a di-muon bump was sought between 25 and 60 GeV.  Although not aimed at hidden valleys, it provides one of the few constraints upon them in this mass range.  And at first glance, it seems to disfavor any signal large enough to explain the ALEPH excess.  But there might be subtleties, so let me not draw firm conclusions yet.]]</span></em> They should also look for the V particle in other ways &#8212; perhaps following the methods I&#8217;ve suggested repeatedly (see for example pages 40-45 of <a href="http://indico.cern.ch/event/46250/attachments/950108/1348060/Strassler.LPC1.pdf">this 2008 talk</a>) &#8212; since the V might not only appear in Z particle decays. <em>[That is: look for boosted V&#8217;s; look for V&#8217;s in high-energy events or high missing-energy events; look for V&#8217;s in events with many jets, possibly with bottom-tags; etc.]</em> In any case, if anything like the V particle really exists, several (and perhaps all) of the experiments should see some evidence for it, and in more than just a single context.</p>
<p>Though we should be skeptical that today&#8217;s paper on ALEPH data is the first step toward a major discovery, at minimum it is important for what it indirectly confirms: that searches at the LHC are far from complete, and that discoveries might lie hidden, for example in rare Z decays (and in rare decays of other particles, such as the top quark.) Neither ATLAS, CMS nor LHCb have ever done a search for rare but spectacular Z particle decays, but they certainly could, as they recently did for the Higgs particle; and if Heister&#8217;s excess turns out to be a real signal, they will be seen to have missed a huge opportunity.  So I hope that Heister&#8217;s paper, at a minimum, will encourage the LHC experiments to undertake a broader and more comprehensive program of searches for low-mass particles with very weak interactions.  Otherwise, my own nightmare, in which the diamonds hidden in the rough might remain undetected &#8212; perhaps for decades &#8212; might come true.</p>
