<p>Well, to be honest, probably it&#8217;s just that: a bump on a plot. But just in case it&#8217;s not &#8212; just in case it <strong>really is</strong> the sign of a new particle in Large Hadron Collider [LHC] data &#8212; let me <em>(start to)</em> address the question.</p>
<p>First: <em>what it isn&#8217;t</em>. It can&#8217;t just be a second Higgs particle (a heavier version of <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-discovery-of-the-higgs/higgs-discovery-the-data/">the one found in 2012</a>) that is just appended to the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/">known particles</a>, with no other particles added in.  <span id="more-8268"></span>If you try to put that idea into the equations, you immediately find the new particle&#8217;s mass is so large that it (or anything similar) would decay <em>very often</em> to other known particles, and <em>very rarely</em> to photons.</p>
<p><em>[Like the Higgs particle, it would only interact with photons <strong>indirectly</strong>, via direct interactions with the other known particles (<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/decays-of-the-standard-model-higgs/">see figure 3 of this post</a>); but unlike the Higgs particle, it is heavy enough that it can decay to any particle/anti-particle pair with which it has direct interactions (<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/decays-of-the-standard-model-higgs/">see figure 2 of the same post</a>); and the direct effect beats any indirect effect.]</em></p>
<p>Therefore, if this idea were correct, either</p>
<ul>
<li>no two-photon events would be observed yet, making the bump impossible, or</li>
<li>there would be tens of thousands of these new particles decaying to pairs of <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/jets-the-manifestation-of-quarks-and-gluons/">jets</a> (from quark/anti-quark pairs), or to top quark/anti-quark pairs, or to charged lepton/anti-lepton pairs&#8230; any of which would have been easily seen in studies done by ATLAS and CMS using the 2011-2012 LHC data.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Now, this has a really interesting implication!</span></strong> If this bump is a real particle, there must be <em>at least</em> one other particle that makes such a two-photon bump possible.  That new particle (maybe heavy, or maybe lightweight) hasn&#8217;t yet been found by the ATLAS or CMS (or LHCb!) experiments, but is almost certainly accessible to them. In fact, signs of an additional particle or particles may already be obvious (or almost obvious) in their existing data. It might just be a question of looking in the right place and of asking the right question.</p>
<p>This is what a lot of theoretical work this week has been about: considering the options for what the two-photon bump&#8217;s source might be, and thinking about further consequences of its possible existence, as far as other particles and forces with which it might be associated.</p>
<p><em>(And yes, I admit it; I chased this ambulance too. Took the week off from work. Didn&#8217;t sleep much.)</em></p>
<p>So <strong><em><span style="color:#800080;">what is it</span></em></strong>? There are a lot of possibilities. It could be a simple elementary particle like the electron, interacting with known particles indirectly, as a result of direct interactions with some heavy, as yet unknown particles. It could be a composite object like a proton, made from objects bound together by a new force that we are about to discover. It might be that the photons to which it seems to decay aren&#8217;t photons after all, but are new particles that mimic photons in some way (an idea that goes back at least to 2000.) I certainly don&#8217;t know what it is, and neither does anyone else yet. But each of the many different ideas comes with <strong><em>predictions</em></strong> &#8212; predictions which in many cases lead to LHC signals that can be looked for <span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>NOW!</b></span></p>
<p>We&#8217;ll have to wait quite a while, six months to a year, before we have enough new data to see the bump either disappear or become a completely convincing signal of a new particle.  However, perhaps the bump is a clue &#8230; a clue that can lead us to a discovery that can happen much sooner.</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>BUT WHAT IS IT????</strong></span> Sometime in the next few weeks I&#8217;ll write a non-expert&#8217;s guide to the various options. Probably this won&#8217;t happen before the holidays, but stay tuned in the New Year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At CERN, the laboratory that hosts the Large Hadron Collider [LHC]. Four years ago, almost to the day. Fabiola Gianotti, spokesperson for the ATLAS experiment, delivered the first talk in a presentation on 2011 LHC data. Speaking to the assembled scientists and dignitaries, she presented the message that energized the physics community: a little bump had shown up on a plot. <span id="more-8086"></span>On the plot were the numbers of proton-proton collisions that had produced two energetic photons <em>(particles of light)</em>, shown versus the &#8220;invariant mass&#8221; of the two photons <em>(the mass that a parent particle would have had, <strong>if</strong> the two photons had come from a parent particle &#8212; although the vast majority of them do not.) </em>Most two-photon production processes are pretty random, and produce data that forms a smooth curve on such a plot. But a new particle decaying to two photons would, if it existed, be observed as a little upward wiggle on that curve. And that&#8217;s what ATLAS&#8217;s data showed.</p>

<p>But those were early days. Statistical flukes happen more often than most people realize, and the bump wasn&#8217;t large enough to be convincing. Still, supporting the case, CMS (represented by Guido Tonelli) showed some hints too around the same mass, not just in two photon events but in some other plots. In retrospect, some of the CMS and ATLAS hints were real, though there was no way to be certain for the next six months.</p>
<p>Then on July 4th, 2012, Joe Incandela of CMS, followed by Gianotti, delivered the coup de grace. The data they showed confirmed a new type of particle, with behavior somewhat resembling a Higgs particle.</p>

<p>Within a few more months, it had become clear that the new particle was indeed a Higgs particle, resembling the one predicted in the Standard Model. <em>(The Standard Model is the set of equations used to predict the behavior of the known particles, with the inclusion of the simplest possible type of Higgs particle. We are calling the new Higgs particle &#8220;Standard Model-<strong>like</strong>&#8221; because we have a lot of work left to do before we can be confident that it <strong>really</strong> is the one that is present in the Standard Model.)</em></p>
<p>Fast forward to today. Gianotti, as of January 1, will become Director General of CERN. It is time now for a new generation of leading scientists to give the presentations on LHC&#8217;s 2015 data. 2011 was the start of a thrilling, exciting, maddening time as we waited through half of 2012 before the existence of the new particle became certain. Will we be so lucky today?  Rumors have been rife. Stay tuned.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the long and careful process of restarting the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC] after its two-year nap for upgrades and repairs, another milestone has been reached: <a href="http://home.web.cern.ch/about/updates/2015/05/low-energy-collisions-tune-lhc-experiments">protons have once again collided inside the LHC&#8217;s experimental detectors</a> (named ATLAS, CMS, LHCb and ALICE). This is good news, but don&#8217;t get excited yet. It&#8217;s just one small step. These are collisions at the lowest energy at which the LHC operates (450 GeV per proton, to be compared with the 4000 GeV per proton in 2012 and the 6500 GeV per proton they&#8217;ve already achieved in the last month, though in non-colliding beams.) Also the number of protons in the beams, and the number of collisions per second, is still very, very small compared to what will be needed. So discoveries are not imminent!  Yesterday&#8217;s milestone was just one of the many little tests that are made to assure that the LHC is properly set up and ready for the first full-energy collisions, which should start in about a month.</p>
<p>But since full-energy collisions are on the horizon, why not listen to a radio show about what the LHC will be doing after its restart is complete? Today (Wednesday May 6th), <a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/virtually-speaking-science">Virtually Speaking Science</a>, on which I have appeared a couple of times before, will run a program at 5 pm Pacific time (8 pm Eastern). Science writer Alan Boyle will be interviewing me about the LHC&#8217;s plans for the next few months and the coming years. You can listen live, or listen later once they post it.  <a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/virtually-speaking-science/2015/05/07/alan-boyle-matt-strassler-large-hadron-collider">Here&#8217;s the link for the program.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As many of you will have already read, the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC], located at the CERN laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland, has &#8220;restarted&#8221;. Well, a restart of such a machine, after two years of upgrades, is not a simple matter, and perhaps we should say that the LHC has &#8220;begun to restart&#8221;. The process of bringing the machine up to speed begins with one weak beam of protons at a time &#8212; with no collisions, and with energy per proton at less than 15% of where the beams were back in 2012. That&#8217;s all that has happened so far.</p>
<p>If that all checks out, then the LHC operators will start trying to accelerate a beam to higher energy &#8212; eventually to record energy, 40% more than in 2012, when the LHC last was operating.  This is the real test of the upgrade; the thousands of magnets all have to work perfectly. If that all checks out, then two beams will be put in at the same time, one going clockwise and the other counterclockwise. Only then, if that all works, will the beams be made to collide &#8212; and the first few collisions of protons will result. After that, the number of collisions per second will increase, gradually. If everything continues to work, we could see the number of collisions become large enough &#8212; approaching 1 billion per second &#8212; to be scientifically interesting within a couple of months. I would not expect important scientific results before late summer, at the earliest.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t to say that the current milestone isn&#8217;t important. There could easily have been (and there almost were) magnet problems that could have delayed this event by a couple of months. But delays could also occur over the coming weeks&#8230; so let&#8217;s not expect too much in 2015. Still, the good news is that once the machine gets rolling, be it in May, June, July or beyond, we have three to four years of data ahead of us, which will offer us many new opportunities for discoveries, anticipated and otherwise.</p>
<p>One thing I find interesting and odd is that many of the news articles reported that <strong>finding dark matter</strong> is the main goal of the newly upgraded LHC. If this is truly the case, then I, and most theoretical physicists I know, didn&#8217;t get the memo. After all,</p>
<ul>
<li>dark matter could easily be of a form that the LHC <em><strong>cannot</strong></em> produce, <em>(for example, axions, or particles that interact only gravitationally, or non-particle-like objects)</em></li>
<li>and even if the LHC finds signs of something that behaves like dark matter (i.e. something that, like neutrinos, cannot be directly detected by LHC&#8217;s experiments), it will be <em>impossible</em> for the LHC to prove that it actually <em>is</em> dark matter.  Proof will require input from other experiments, and could take decades to obtain.</li>
</ul>
<p>What&#8217;s my own understanding of LHC&#8217;s current purpose? Well, based on 25 years of particle physics research and ten years working almost full time on LHC physics, I would say (and I do say, in my public talks) that the coming several-year run of the LHC is for the purpose of</p>
<ol>
<li>studying the newly discovered <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/">Higgs particle</a> in great detail, checking its properties very carefully against the predictions of the &#8220;Standard Model&#8221; <em>(the equations that describe <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/">the known apparently-elementary particles and forces</a>) </em> to see whether our current understanding of the <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/">Higgs field</a> is complete and correct, and</li>
<li>trying to find particles or other phenomena that might resolve the <a title="Naturalness and the Standard Model" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/naturalness/">naturalness puzzle</a> of the Standard Model, a puzzle which makes many particle physicists suspicious that we are missing an important part of the story, and</li>
<li>seeking <em><strong>either</strong></em> dark matter particles <em><strong>or</strong> particles that may be shown someday to be &#8220;associated&#8221; with dark matter.</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Finding dark matter <em>itself</em> is a worthy goal, but the LHC may simply not be the right machine for the job, and certainly can&#8217;t do the job alone.</p>
<p>Why the discrepancy between these two views of LHC&#8217;s purpose? One possibility is that since <em><strong>everybody</strong></em> has heard of <strong>dark matter</strong>, the goal of finding it is easier for scientists to explain to journalists, even though it&#8217;s not central.  And in turn, it is easier for journalists to explain this goal to readers who don&#8217;t care to know the real situation.  By the time the story goes to press, all the modifiers and nuances uttered by the scientists are gone, and all that remains is &#8220;LHC looking for dark matter&#8221;.  Well, stay tuned to this blog, and you&#8217;ll get a much more accurate story.</p>
<p>Fortunately <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-32106990">a much more balanced story did appear in the BBC, due to Pallab Ghosh</a>&#8230;, though as usual in Europe, with rather too much supersymmetry and not enough of other approaches to the naturalness problem.   Ghosh also does mention what I described in the italicized part of point 3 above &#8212; the possibility of what he calls the &#8220;wonderfully evocatively named `dark sector&#8217; &#8221;.  <em>[Mr. Ghosh: back in 2006, well before these ideas were popular, Kathryn Zurek and I named this a &#8220;hidden valley&#8221;, potentially relevant either for dark matter or the naturalness problem. We like to think this is a much more evocative name.]</em>  A dark sector/hidden valley would involve <em>several</em> types of particles that interact with one another, but interact hardly at all with anything that we and our surroundings are made from.  Typically, one of these types of particles could make up dark matter, but the others would unsuitable for making dark matter.  So why are these others important?  <strong><em>Because if they are produced at the LHC, they may <a title="Most Particles Decay — But Why?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/why-do-particles-decay/most-particles-decay-why/">decay</a> in a fashion that is easy to observe</em></strong> &#8212; easier than dark matter itself, which simply exits the LHC experiments without a trace, and can only be inferred from something recoiling against it.   In other words, if such a dark sector [or more generally, a hidden valley of any type] exists, the best targets for LHC&#8217;s experiments (and other experiments, such as <a href="http://hallaweb.jlab.org/experiment/APEX/">APEX</a> or <a href="http://ship.web.cern.ch/ship/">SHiP</a>) are often not the <a title="Most Particles Decay — Yet Some Don’t!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/why-do-particles-decay/most-particles-decay-yet-some-dont/">stable</a> particles that could form dark matter but their unstable friends and associates.</p>
<p>But this will all be irrelevant if the collider doesn&#8217;t work, so&#8230; first things first.  Let&#8217;s all wish the accelerator physicists success as they gradually bring the newly powerful LHC back into full operation, at a record energy per collision and eventually a record collision rate.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hope all of you had a good holiday and a good start to the New Year!</p>
<p>I myself continue to be extraordinarily busy as we move into 2015, but I am glad to say that some of that activity involves communicating science to the public.  In fact, <strong>a week from today</strong> I will be giving a public talk &#8212; really a short talk and a longer question/answer period &#8212; in Cambridge, just outside of Boston and not far from MIT. This event is a part of the monthly &#8220;CafeSci&#8221; series, which is affiliated with the famous <a href="http://www.wgbh.org/programs/NOVA-16?MM=1">NOVA science television programs</a> produced for decades by <a href="http://www.wgbh.org/">public TV/Radio station WGBH</a> in Boston.</p>
<p>Note for those of you have gone before to CafeSci events: <strong>it will be in a new venue, not far from Kendall Square</strong>. Here&#8217;s the announcement:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Tuesday, January 20th at 7pm (about 1 hour long)<br />
Le Laboratoire Cambridge (NEW LOCATION)<br />
<a href="http://www.lelaboratoirecambridge.com">http://www.lelaboratoirecambridge.com/ </a><br />
650 East Kendall St, Cambridge, MA</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>“The Large Hadron Collider Restarts Soon! What Lies Ahead?&#8221;</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Speaker: Matthew Strassler</p>
<p><span style="color:#800080;"><em>&#8220;After a long nap, the Large Hadron Collider [LHC], where the Higgs particle was discovered in 2012, will begin operating again in 2015, with more powerful collisions than before. Now that we know Higgs particles exist, what do we want to know about them? What methods can we use to answer our questions? And what is the most important puzzle that we are hoping the LHC will help us solve?&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p>Public Transit: Red line to Kendall Square, walk straight down 3rd Street, turn right onto Athenaeum Street, and left onto East Kendall</p>
<p>Parking: There is a parking deck &#8211; the 650 East Kendall Street Garage &#8211; accessible by Linskey Way.</p>

<p>Let me give you one very simple example of how things can go wrong, and how the ATLAS and CMS experiments [the two general purpose experiments at the LHC] attempted to address the problem.  Before you read this, you may want to read <a title="Final Days of Busy Visit to CERN" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/12/02/final-days-of-busy-visit-to-cern/"><span style="color:#000000;">my last post</span></a>, which gives an overview of what I&#8217;ll be talking about in this one.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m a few days behind (thanks to an NSF grant proposal that had to be finished last week) but I wanted to write a bit more about <a title="Day 2 At CERN" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/11/12/day-2-at-cern/">my visit to CERN</a>, which concluded Nov. 21st in a whirlwind of activity. I was working full tilt on timely issues related to Run 2 of the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC], currently scheduled to start early next May.   (You may recall the LHC has been shut down for repairs and upgrades since the end of 2012.)</p>
<p>A certain fraction of my time for the last decade has been taken up by concerns about the LHC experiments&#8217; ability to observe new long-lived particles, specifically ones that aren&#8217;t affected by <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/">the electromagnetic or strong nuclear forces</a>. (Long-lived particles that <em>are</em> affected by those forces are easier to search for, and are much more constrained by the LHC experiments.  More about them some other time.)</p>
<p>This subject is important to me because it is a classic example of how <a title="The Trigger: Discarding All But the Gold" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/the-trigger-discarding-all-but-the-gold/">the trigger systems</a> at LHC experiments could fail us &#8212; whereby a spectacular signal of a new phenomena could be discarded and lost in the very process of taking and storing the data! If no one thinks carefully about the challenges of finding long-lived particles in advance of running the LHC, we can end up losing a huge opportunity, unnecessarily. Fortunately some of us are thinking about it, but we are small in number. It is an uphill battle for those experimenters within ATLAS and CMS [the two general purpose experiments at the LHC] who are working hard to make sure they have the required triggers available. I can&#8217;t tell you how many times people within the experiments &#8212; even at <a title="At the Naturalness 2014 Conference" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/11/17/at-the-naturalness-2014-conference/">the Naturalness conference</a> I wrote about recently &#8212; have told me &#8220;such efforts are hopeless&#8221;&#8230; despite the fact that their own experiments have actually shown, already in public and in some cases published measurements (including <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1203.1303">this</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1411.6977">this</a>, <a href="http://cds.cern.ch/record/1740972/files/ATLAS-CONF-2014-041.pdf">this</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1411.6530">this</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1409.0746">this</a>, and <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1409.4789">this</a>), that it is not. Conversely, many completely practical searches for long-lived particles have not been carried out, often because there was no trigger strategy able to capture them, or because, despite the events having been recorded, no one at ATLAS or CMS has had time or energy to actually search through their data for this signal.</p>
<p>Now what is meant by &#8220;long-lived particles&#8221;?<span id="more-7789"></span></p>
<p><a title="Most Particles Decay — But Why?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/why-do-particles-decay/most-particles-decay-why/">Most types of particles decay</a> (i.e., disintegrate into lower-mass particles). Any particular <em>type</em> of particle has an <em>average</em> lifetime, though an <strong>individual</strong> one may live a <strong>longer or shorter</strong> life than the average.  A <a title="The Nuclei of Atoms: At the Heart of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-nuclei-of-atoms-at-the-heart-of-matter/">neutron</a>, if found outside a stable <a title="The Nuclei of Atoms: At the Heart of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-nuclei-of-atoms-at-the-heart-of-matter/">atomic nucleus</a>, decays into a proton, and electron and an anti-neutrino after about 15 minutes&#8230; sometimes shorter, sometimes longer, but 15 minutes on average.</p>
<p>In the context of the LHC, the term &#8220;long-lived particle&#8221; doesn&#8217;t mean a particle will outlast you and me! or even a neutron.  It merely that its average lifetime is long enough that, if traveling at a good fraction of the speed of light, it is likely to move a measurable distance before it decays&#8230; i.e. that it lives a <em>trillionth of a second</em> or longer. The ATLAS and CMS experiments, despite being the size of small office buildings, are able to detect when a particle&#8217;s decay occurs a millimeter (about 1/25 of an inch) away, or even less, from the location of the proton-proton collision where it was created. <em>(Pretty amazing, huh? My experimental colleagues are awesome.)</em> This astounding ability is critical in identifying bottom and charm quarks, which often decay at a location separated from the collision point by as little as a millimeter.</p>
<p>In contrast to a neutron, the <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/">Higgs particle</a> which was <a title="Discovery of the Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-discovery-of-the-higgs/">discovered at ATLAS and CMS</a> in 2012 is very short-lived; a typical Higgs particle, from its birth to its death at the LHC, <strong><em>won&#8217;t even travel an atom&#8217;s width</em></strong> from the location at which it was created, living about a billionth of a trillionth of a second. But there are other known particles that are much longer lived, such as the muon. A muon, once produced, will survive for two millionths of a second on average &#8212; during which, if it is traveling at a good fraction of the speed of light*, it can travel a good fraction of a mile.</p>
<p>*<span style="color:#808080;"><em>Due to time dilation, a consequence of relativity à la Einstein, if the muon is traveling very close to the speed of light relative to us, it will actually, from our point of view, live longer and travel further than average. This is why very high energy muons created in cosmic ray collisions high in the atmosphere often are able to travel hundreds of miles, often <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttjkd_E7-58">reaching the Earth&#8217;s surface</a>.</em></span></p>
<p>But the really important question for the LHC is whether it might be able to produce <em>as-yet unknown</em> particles that have long lifetimes. We haven&#8217;t found a long-lived particle for a while &#8212; the bottom quark was the most recently discovered long-lived elementary particle, and that was about 40 years ago &#8212; but we found many before, and why shouldn&#8217;t there be others? Indeed such particles are predicted, with small to moderate certainty, in various speculations that have been considered by theorists over the years, including some creative ideas about the nature of dark matter, certain forms of <a title="Supersymmetry — What Is It?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/supersymmetry-what-is-it/">supersymmetry</a>, various attempts to understand the masses of <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/">the known particles</a>, etc. What got me interested in the problem, back in 2001 or so, is that I noticed that if one takes a broad view, and considers a wider set of variants of these speculative ideas, one quickly sees that <em>long-lived particles are far more common than they are in the most popular variants of these ideas</em>. (After some intermittent research, this observation was finally published in <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0604261">2006 work with Kathryn Zurek</a>.)</p>
<p>In other words, <em>due to cultural biases among scientists, but not due to anything about nature itself, the possibility of long-lived particles was viewed as far more remote than it really is</em>. (Though the biases have improved since 2006, to a certain extent they still remain.) And for this reason, the LHC experiments, as of 2006, had prepared for only a fraction of the possibilities, and were even lacking trigger strategies that could be sensitive to certain types of long-lived particles. The worry was especially acute if the long-lived particles were created mainly in the decays of a lightweight Higgs particle. A Higgs particle of mass 125 GeV/c², such as the one we have in nature, has such low mass-energy (125 GeV) compared to the energy of LHC proton-on-proton collisions (7000 GeV in 2011, 8000 GeV in 2012, and 13,000 GeV starting in 2015) that its decays are generally unspectacular and are difficult to observe; the 2012 discovery of the Higgs required careful trigger design, and this will become even more important for Higgs studies in Run 2. So I have spent a lot of time since 2007 trying to help change the situation, so that we can be sure that, if such particles exist, we will discover them, and if we don&#8217;t find them, we&#8217;ll be confident we did a thorough search and didn&#8217;t just miss one for lack of trying.  To this end, I spent much of my time at CERN giving talks and having extended conversations, both planned and spontaneous, with experimental colleagues at ATLAS and CMS, and discussing the issues with theorist colleagues as well.</p>
<p>I realize this is a bit abstract, so in a day or two I&#8217;ll give you a more detailed example of how a new trigger strategy can be crucial in allowing for the possibility of a discovery of long-lived particles.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greetings from the last day of the conference &#8220;<a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/290373/" target="_blank">Naturalness 2014</a>&#8220;, where theorists and experimentalists involved with the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC] are discussing <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/naturalness/" target="_blank">one of the most widely-discussed questions in high-energy physics:</a> <em>are the laws of nature in our universe &#8220;natural&#8221; (= &#8220;generic&#8221;), and if not, why not?</em> It&#8217;s so widely discussed that one of my concerns coming in to the conference was whether anyone would have anything new to say that hadn&#8217;t already been said many times.</p>
<p>What makes the Standard Model&#8217;s equations (which are the equations governing <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the known particles</a>, including the simplest possible Higgs particle) so <a title="Naturalness and the Standard Model" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/naturalness/" target="_blank">&#8220;unnatural&#8221; (i.e. &#8220;non-generic&#8221;)</a> is that when one combines the Standard Model with, say, Einstein&#8217;s gravity equations. or indeed with any other equations involving additional particles and fields, one finds that the parameters in the equations (such as the strength of the electromagnetic force or the interaction of the electron with the Higgs field) must be chosen so that certain effects almost perfectly cancel, to one part in a gazillion* (something like 10³²). If this cancellation fails, the universe described by these equations looks nothing like the one we know. <a title="Naturalness and the Standard Model" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/naturalness/" target="_blank">I&#8217;ve discussed this non-genericity in some detail here.</a></p>
<p>*<em>A gazillion, as defined on this website, is a number so big that it even makes particle physicists and cosmologists flinch. [From Old English, gajillion.]</em></p>
<p>Most theorists who have tried to address the naturalness problem have tried adding new principles, and consequently new particles, to the Standard Model&#8217;s equations, so that this extreme cancellation is no longer necessary, or so that the cancellation is automatic, or something to this effect. Their suggestions have included <a title="Supersymmetry" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/" target="_blank">supersymmetry</a>, warped <a title="Extra Dimensions" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/extra-dimensions/" target="_blank">extra dimensions</a>, little Higgs, etc&#8230;. but importantly, these examples are only natural if the lightest of the new particles that they predict have masses that are around or below 1 <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/" target="_blank">TeV</a>/c², and must therefore be directly observable at the LHC (with a few very interesting exceptions, which I&#8217;ll talk about some other time). The details are far too complex to go into here, but the constraints from what was <em><strong>not</strong></em> discovered at LHC in 2011-2012 implies that most of these examples don&#8217;t work perfectly. Some partial non-automatic cancellation, not at one part in a gazillion but at one part in 100, seems to be necessary for almost all of the suggestions made up to now.</p>
<p>So what are we to think of this?<span id="more-7774"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe one of the few examples that is entirely natural and is still consistent with current data is correct, and will turn up at the LHC in 2015 or 2016 or so, when the LHC begins running at higher energy per collision than was available in 2011-2012.</li>
<li>Maybe one of the examples that isn&#8217;t entirely natural is correct. After all, one part in 100 isn&#8217;t awful to contemplate, unlike one part in a gazillion. We do know of other weird things about the world that are improbable, such as the fact that the Sun and the Moon appear to be almost exactly the same size in the Earth&#8217;s sky. So maybe our universe is slightly non-generic, and therefore discoveries of new particles that we might have expected to see in 2011-2012 are going to be delayed until 2015 or beyond.</li>
<li>Maybe naturalness is simply not a good guide to guessing our universe&#8217;s laws, perhaps because the universe&#8217;s history, or its structure, forced it to be extremely non-generic, or perhaps because the universe as a whole is generic but huge and variegated (this is often called a &#8220;multiverse&#8221;, but be careful, because that word is used in several very different ways &#8212; see here for discussion) and we can only live in an extremely non-generic part of it.</li>
<li>Maybe naturalness is not a good guide because there&#8217;s something wrong with the naturalness argument, perhaps because quantum field theory itself, on which the argument rests, or some other essential assumption, is breaking down.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the most important issues at this conference are: how can we determine experimentally which of these possibilities is correct (or whether another we haven&#8217;t thought of is correct)? In this regard, what measurements do we need to make at the LHC in 2015 and beyond? What theoretical directions concerning naturalness have been underexplored, and might any of them suggest new measurements at LHC (or elsewhere) that have not yet been attempted?</p>
<p>I am afraid my time is too limited to report on highlights. Most of the progress reported at this conference has been incremental rather than major steps; there weren&#8217;t any big new solutions to the naturalness problem proposed.  But it has been a good opportunity for an exchange of ideas among theorists and experimentalists, with a number of new approaches to LHC measurements being presented and discussed, and with some interesting conversation regarding the theoretical and conceptual issues surrounding naturalness, selection bias (sometimes called &#8220;anthropics&#8221;), and the behavior of quantum field theory.</p>
