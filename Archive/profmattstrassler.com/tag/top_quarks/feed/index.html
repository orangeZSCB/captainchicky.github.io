<p>We particle physicists are extremely fortunate that this particular quantum field theory is just one step more complicated than the very simplest quantum field theories. If this hadn&#8217;t been the case, we might still be trying to figure out how it works, and we wouldn&#8217;t be able to make detailed and precise predictions for how the known elementary particles will behave in our experiments, such as those at the <a title="Introduction to the&nbsp;LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC].</p>
<p>In order to make predictions for processes that we can measure at the LHC, using the equations of the Standard Model, we employ a method of<em> successive approximation</em> (with the jargon name &#8220;method of perturbations&#8221;, or &#8220;perturbation `theory&#8217; &#8221;). It&#8217;s a very common method in math and science, in which</p>
<ul>
<li>we make an initial rough estimate,</li>
<li>and then correct the estimate,</li>
<li>and then correct the correction,</li>
<li>etc.,</li>
</ul>
<p>until we have a prediction that is precise enough for our needs.</p>
<p>What are those needs? Well, the precision of any measurement, in any context, is always limited by having</p>
<ul>
<li>a finite amount of data (so small statistical flukes are common)</li>
<li>imperfect equipment (so small mistakes are inevitable).</li>
</ul>
<p>What we need, for each measurement, is a prediction a little more precise than the measurement will be, but not much more so. In the difficult environment of the LHC, where measurements are really hard, we often need only the first correction to the original estimate; sometimes we need the second (see Figure 2).</p>

<p>Until recently the calculations were done by starting with Feynman&#8217;s famous diagrams, but the diagrams are not as efficient as one would like, and <a title="From String Theory to the Large Hadron&nbsp;Collider" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/08/15/from-string-theory-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">new techniques</a> have made them mostly obsolete for really hard calculations.</p>
<p>The method of successive approximation works as long <em>as all the forces involved are rather &#8220;weak&#8221;</em>, in a technical sense. Now this notion of &#8220;weak&#8221; is complicated enough (and important enough) that <a title="The Strengths of the Known&nbsp;Forces" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-forces-of-nature/the-strength-of-the-known-forces/" target="_blank">I wrote a whole article on it</a>, so those who really want to understand this should read that article. The brief summary suitable for today is this: suppose you took two particles that are attracted to each other by a force, and allowed them to glom together, <a title="Atoms: Their Inner&nbsp;Workings" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/atoms-building-blocks-of-molecules/atoms-their-inner-workings/" target="_blank">like an electron and a proton</a>, to form an atom-like object. &nbsp;Then <em>if the relative velocity of the two particles is small compared to the speed of light, the force is weak</em>. The stronger the force, the faster the particles will move around inside their &#8220;atom&#8221;. &nbsp;(For more details see&nbsp;<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-forces-of-nature/the-strength-of-the-known-forces/">this article</a>.&nbsp;)</p>
<p>For a weak force, the method of successive approximation is very useful, because the correction to the initial estimate is small, and <span style="color:#808080;">the correction to the correction is smaller</span>, and <span style="color:#999999;">the correction to the correction to the correction is even smaller</span>. So for a weak force, the first or second correction is usually enough; one doesn&#8217;t have to calculate forever in order to get a sufficiently precise prediction. The &#8220;stronger&#8221; the force, in this technical sense, the harder you have to work to get a precise prediction, because the corrections to your estimate are larger.</p>
<p>If a force is truly strong, though, everything breaks down. In that case, the correction to the estimate is as big as the estimate, and the next correction is again just as big, so no method of successive approximation will get you close to the answer. In short, <em>for truly strong forces,</em> <em><strong>you need a completely different approach</strong></em> if you are to make predictions.</p>
<p>In the Standard Model, the electromagnetic force and the weak nuclear force are &#8220;weak&#8221; in all contexts. However, the strong nuclear force is (technically) &#8220;strong&#8221; for any processes that involve distances comparable to or larger than a <a title="What’s a Proton,&nbsp;Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/" target="_blank">proton</a>&#8216;s size (about 100,000 times smaller than an <a title="Atoms: Building Blocks of&nbsp;Molecules" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/atoms-building-blocks-of-molecules/" target="_blank">atom</a>) or energies comparable to or smaller than a proton&#8217;s mass-energy (about 1 <a title="GeV and&nbsp;TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/" target="_blank">GeV</a>). For such processes, successive approximation does not work at all; it can&#8217;t be used to calculate a proton&#8217;s size or mass or internal structure. In fact <em>the first step in that method would estimate that quarks and anti-quarks and gluons are free to roam independently and the proton should not exist at all</em>&#8230; which is so obviously completely wrong that no method of correcting it will ever give the right answer. &nbsp;I&#8217;ll get back to how we show protons are predicted by these equations, using big computers, in a later post.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s a remarkable fact about the strong nuclear force. As I said, at distances the size of a proton or larger, the strong nuclear force is so strong that successive approximation doesn&#8217;t work. Yet, at distances shorter than this, <strong>the force actually becomes &#8220;weak&#8221;</strong>, <em>in the technical sense</em>, and successive approximation <em>does</em> work there.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">Let me make sure this is absolutely clear, because the difference between what we think of colloquially as &#8220;weak&#8221; is different from &#8220;weak&#8221; in the sense I&#8217;m using it here. &nbsp;Suppose you put two quarks very close together, at a distance r closer together than the radius R of a proton. &nbsp;In Figure 3 I&#8217;ve plotted how big the strong nuclear force (purple) and the electromagnetic force (blue) would be between two quarks, as a function of the distance between them. Notice both forces are very strong (colloquially) at short distances (r &lt;&lt; R), but (I assert) both forces are weak (technically) there. &nbsp;The electromagnetic force is much the weaker of the two, which is why its curve is lower in the plot. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">Now if you move the two quarks apart a bit (increasing r, but still with r &lt;&lt; R), both forces become smaller; in fact both decrease almost like 1/r², which would be your first, naive estimate, same as in your high school science class. If this naive estimate were correct, both forces would maintain the same strength (technically) at all distances r. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">But this isn&#8217;t quite right. &nbsp;Since the 1950s, it was well-known that the correction to this estimate (using successive approximation methods) is to make the electromagnetic force decrease <em>just a little faster</em> than that; it becomes a tiny bit weaker (technically) at longer distances. &nbsp;In the 60s, that&#8217;s what most people thought any force described by quantum field theory would do. But they were wrong. &nbsp;In 1973, David Politzer, and David Gross and Frank Wilczek, showed that&nbsp;<strong><em>for the quantum field theory of quarks and gluons, the correction to the naive estimate goes the other direction</em></strong>; it makes the force decrease just a little more <em><strong>slowly</strong></em> than 1/r². <em>[Gerard &#8216;t Hooft had also calculated this, but apparently without fully recognizing its importance&#8230;?]</em> It is the small, accumulating excess above the naive estimate &#8212; the gradual deviation of the purple curve from its naive 1/r² form &#8212; that leads us to say that this force becomes technically &#8220;stronger&#8221; and &#8220;stronger&#8221; at larger distances. Once the distance r becomes comparable to a proton&#8217;s size R, the force becomes so &#8220;strong&#8221; that successive approximation methods fail. &nbsp;As shown in the figure, we have some evidence that the force becomes constant for r &gt;&gt; R, independent of distance. &nbsp;It is this effect that, as we&#8217;ll see next time, is responsible for the existence of <a title="The Nuclei of Atoms: At the Heart of&nbsp;Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-nuclei-of-atoms-at-the-heart-of-matter/" target="_blank">protons and neutrons</a>, and therefore of all ordinary matter.</span></p>

<p>So:&nbsp;<em>at very short distances and high energies, the strong nuclear force is a somewhat &#8220;weak&#8221; force</em>, stronger still than the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces, but similar to them. &nbsp;And therefore,&nbsp;<span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">successive approximation <strong>can</strong> tell you what happens when a quark inside one speeding proton hits a quark in a proton speeding the other direction, as long as the quarks collide with energy far more than 1 GeV. <em><strong>If this weren&#8217;t true, we could make scarcely any predictions at the LHC, and at similar proton-proton and proton-antiproton colliders!</strong></em>&nbsp;(We do also need to know about the proton&#8217;s structure, but we don&#8217;t calculate that: we simply measure it in other experiments.) &nbsp;In particular, we would never have been able to calculate how often we should be making top quarks, as in Figure 2. &nbsp;And we would not have been able to calculate what the Standard Model, or any other quantum field theory, predicts for the rate at which <a title="Production of the Standard Model Higgs&nbsp;Particle" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/production-of-the-standard-model-higgs-particle/" target="_blank">Higgs particles are produced</a>, so we&#8217;d never have been sure that the LHC would either find or exclude the Standard Model Higgs particle. Fortunately, it <em>is</em> true, and that is why precise predictions can be made, for so many processes, at the LHC. &nbsp;And the success of those and other predictions underlies our confidence that the Standard Model correctly describes most of what we know about particle physics.</span></p>
<p>But still, the equations of the strong nuclear force have only quarks and anti-quarks and gluons in them &#8212; no protons, neutrons, or other hadrons. &nbsp;Our understanding of the real world would certainly be incomplete if we didn&#8217;t know why there are protons. &nbsp;Well, it turns out that <em><strong>if we want to know whether protons and neutrons and other hadrons are actually predicted by the strong nuclear force&#8217;s equations, we have to test this notion using big computers</strong></em>. And that&#8217;s tricky, even trickier than you might guess.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Particle physicists, cataloging the fundamental forces of nature, have named two of them the <strong>strong</strong> nuclear force and the <strong>weak</strong> nuclear force. <em>[A <strong>force</strong> is simply any phenomenon that pushes or pulls on objects.]</em> More generally they talk about <strong><em>strong</em></strong> and <strong><em>weak</em></strong> forces, speaking of electromagnetism as <em>rather weak</em> and gravity as <em>extremely weak</em>.  What do the words &#8220;strong&#8221; and &#8220;weak&#8221; mean here?  Don&#8217;t electric forces become strong at short distances? Isn&#8217;t gravity a pretty strong force, given that it makes it hard to lift a bar of gold?</p>
<p>Well, these words don&#8217;t mean what you think.  Yes, the electric force between two electrons becomes <em>stronger</em> (in <strong><em>absolute</em></strong> terms) as you bring them closer together; the force grows as one over the square of the distance between them.  Yet physicists, when speaking their own language to each other, will view this behavior as what is expected of a typical force, and so will say that &#8220;electromagnetism&#8217;s strength is <em>unchanging</em> with distance &#8212; and it is rather <em>weak</em> at all distances.</p>
<p>And the strength of gravity between the Earth and a bar of gold isn&#8217;t relevant either; physicists are interested in the strength of forces between individual elementary (or at least small) particles, not between large objects containing enormous numbers of particles.</p>
<p>Clearly there is a language difference here&#8230; as is often the case with words in English and words in Physics-ese.  It requires translation.  So I have now written <a title="The Strengths of the Known Forces" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-forces-of-nature/the-strength-of-the-known-forces/">an article explaining the language of &#8220;strong&#8221; and &#8220;weak&#8221; forces used by particle physicists</a>, describing how it works, why it is useful, and what it teaches us about the known forces: gravity, electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force, and the <em>(still unobserved but surely present)</em> Higgs force.<span id="more-6091"></span>  Physicists needed a deep understanding of quantum mechanics, special relativity, and their marriage in quantum field theory, developed over many decades, to understand that this way of talking about the strengths of forces is the best one to use.  It&#8217;s not the most natural one in daily life, but daily life reveals nothing of quantum field theory, so it isn&#8217;t surprising (or unusual) that what makes sense to us in our ordinary experience gives us a manner of speaking that isn&#8217;t useful in the world of particles and fields, and <em>vice versa</em>.</p>
<p>I hope this article will give you some interesting insights into how our world works, and clarify some things that may have been mysterious: why the weak nuclear force is weak; where the idea of &#8220;Grand Unification&#8221; initially comes from; why the proton&#8217;s size is what it is and why it is so much more complicated than an atom; why we observe gravity even though it is so much weaker than the other forces; and why the Higgs <em>force</em> hasn&#8217;t yet been observed, even though the Higgs force bears some passing (<a title="Why the Higgs and Gravity are Unrelated" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/10/15/why-the-higgs-and-gravity-are-unrelated/" target="_blank">though misleading</a>) resemblance to gravity, and even though we already know that there&#8217;s at least one Higgs field and one Higgs particle.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My rather hasty, breathless and inconsistent summaries (<a title="The Higgs Symposium in Edinburgh" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/01/09/the-higgs-symposium-in-edinburgh/" target="_blank">#1</a>, <a title="Day 2 of Higgs Symposium" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/01/10/day-2-of-higgs-symposium/" target="_blank">#2</a> and <a title="Conclusion of the Higgs Symposium" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/01/14/conclusion-of-the-higgs-symposium/" target="_blank">#3</a>) of last week&#8217;s talks at the excellent <a href="http://higgs.ph.ed.ac.uk/workshops/higgs-symposium" target="_blank">Higgs Symposium</a> (held at the University of Edinburgh, as part of the new Higgs Center for Theoretical Physics) clearly had their limitations.  So I thought it might be useful to give a more organized overview, with more careful language appropriate for non-expert readers, of our current knowledge and ignorance concerning <a title="A New Era Dawns" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/07/05/a-new-era-dawns/" target="_blank">the recently discovered Higgs-like particle</a> (which most of us do believe is a <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">Higgs particle</a> of some type, though not necessarily of the simplest, &#8220;Standard Model&#8221; type.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m therefore writing <a title="Taking Stock of the “Higgs” (Jan. 2013)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/taking-stock-of-the-higgs-jan-2013/" target="_blank">an article that tries to put the questions about the Higgs-like particle into a sensible order, and then draws upon the talks that were given at the Symposium to provide the current best answers</a>. About half of the article is done, and you&#8217;re welcome to read it.  Due to other commitments, I won&#8217;t probably get back to finish it until next week.  But &#8220;Part 1&#8221; is long enough that it will take some time for most readers to absorb anyway&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes, it was funny, as I hope you enjoyed in my <a title="Particles are People Too" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/12/01/particles-are-people-too/">post from Saturday</a>; but really, when we step back and look at it, something is dreadfully wrong and quite sad.  Somehow TIME magazine, fairly reputable on the whole, in the process of reporting the nomination of a particle<em> (the Higgs Boson; here&#8217;s <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">my FAQ about it</a> and here&#8217;s <a title="Why the Higgs Particle Matters" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/why-the-higgs-particle-matters/" target="_blank">my layperson&#8217;s explanation of why it is important</a>)</em> as a Person (?) of the Year, <a href="http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2128881_2128882_2129214,00.html" target="_blank">explained the nature of this particle with a disastrous paragraph of five astoundingly erroneous sentences</a>.   Treating this as a &#8220;teaching moment&#8221; <em>(yes, always the professor &#8212; can&#8217;t help myself)</em> I want to go through those sentences carefully and fix them, not to string up or further embarrass the journalist but to be useful to my readers.  So that&#8217;s coming in a moment.</p>
<p>But first, a lament.</p>
<p>Who&#8217;s at fault here, and how did this happen?  There&#8217;s plenty of blame to go around; some lies with the journalist, who would have been wise to run his prose past a science journalist buddy; some lies with the editors, who didn&#8217;t do basic fact checking, even of the non-science issues; some lies with a public that (broadly) doesn&#8217;t generally care enough about science for editors to make it a priority to have accurate reporting on the subject.  But there&#8217;s a history here.  How did it happen that we ended up a technological society, relying heavily on the discoveries of modern physics and other sciences over the last century, and yet we have a public that is at once confused by, suspicious of, bored by, and unfamiliar with science?   I think a lot of the blame also lies with scientists, who collectively over generations have failed to communicate both what we do and why it&#8217;s important &#8212; and why it&#8217;s important for journalists not to misrepresent it.<span id="more-5067"></span></p>
<p>On good days I like to think that blogging is a step forward, which allows for much broader, more accurate and more rapid communication with the public and with journalists than was previously possible.  There are many good websites and blogs that can address the physics of the Higgs particle far better than any science magazine or newspaper science section could hope to: these include (but are by no means not limited to) <a href="http://resonaances.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Resonaances</a>, <a href="http://www.quantumdiaries.org/" target="_blank">Quantum Diaries</a>, <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/" target="_blank">Cosmic Variance</a>, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/life-and-physics" target="_blank">Life and Physics</a>, <a href="http://www.science20.com/quantum_diaries_survivor" target="_blank">A Quantum Diaries Survivor</a>, <a href="http://motls.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">The Reference Frame</a>, <a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/" target="_blank">Not Even Wrong</a>, <a href="http://blog.vixra.org/" target="_blank">Vixra</a>, &#8230;  there must be a dozen others. Even though I often disagree with some of the more polemical and extreme bloggers about details of the science &#8212; what is or isn&#8217;t excluded by data, how data ought to be analyzed, what the important issues in the field are &#8212; all of these bloggers are expert enough to get most of the particle physics right most of the time, and readers, by reading the various blogs, can get something of a balanced point of view and figure out what&#8217;s mainstream sensible and what&#8217;s polemic overstatement. <em> [Of course, there are other blogs out there are packed with misleading information about the basic science, but that&#8217;s an issue for another day.] </em> But even collectively, we&#8217;re simply not reaching enough of the public at large yet.  We saw that in the craziness about faster-than-light neutrinos last year.  We&#8217;re seeing it this year with the Higgs particle.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m not alone among the bloggers and book authors in feeling that if the journalist or editors at TIME had ever once read one &#8212; <em>just one</em> &#8212; of the many short articles we&#8217;ve all written for laypersons explaining something about the Higgs particle <em>(e.g., <a title="Why the Higgs Particle Matters" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/why-the-higgs-particle-matters/" target="_blank">Why the Higgs Particle Matters</a>)</em> many of the errors in the TIME piece would never have happened.  How can we collectively get a wider readership, at least among journalists?</p>
<p>Ok.  Here we go.  Here&#8217;s what TIME said, and what&#8217;s wrong with it.  Read it and weep.  Or laugh.  Or both.</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">Take a moment to thank this little particle for all the work it does, because without it,</span></p>
<ul>
<li><a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">The <strong>field</strong>, not the particle, does the job; the particle is just a ripple in that field.</a>  No reason to thank the Higgs particle, except in that it is very useful for providing deeper insight into the nature of the Higgs field.  (Or <em>field<span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>s</strong></span></em>; we don&#8217;t yet know there&#8217;s only one.) But the journalist is making a very common mistake.  As I wrote in <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">the Higgs FAQ</a>, &#8220;&#8230;the Higgs particle gets all the attention, while the poor Higgs field labors in obscurity, protecting the universe from catastrophe but getting none of its deserved credit…&#8221;  And this mis-attribution of credit is, I fear, largely scientists&#8217; fault, because of glib shortcuts taken in explaining things too briefly to journalists and to the public<em>.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">you’d be just inchoate energy without so much as a bit of mass.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Well, this is so wrong it&#8217;s hard to say how it&#8217;s wrong.  Of course, you wouldn&#8217;t <strong>be</strong>, so it&#8217;s hard to say exactly <strong>what</strong> you&#8217;d be.  What would really happen is that your electrons would no longer form atoms with the protons and neutrons in your atomic nuclei, so you&#8217;d explode.  Without the Higgs field, atoms would not form and there could be no ordinary matter; BUT protons and neutrons, composite particles made out of massless elementary ones, would still have a mass.  And since protons and neutrons make up most of <em><strong>your</strong></em> mass, it&#8217;s not true at any level that you would simply turn into massless things.  And massless things aren&#8217;t the same as energy, anyway; see below.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">What’s more, the same would be true for the entire universe.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s not clear what the writer means here, but it&#8217;s certainly not correct. Within the universe, <a title="Why the Higgs and Gravity are Unrelated" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/10/15/why-the-higgs-and-gravity-are-unrelated/" target="_blank">many things with mass, including protons and neutrons but also black holes, and probably dark matter, would maintain their masses even with no Higgs field</a>.  And the mass of the universe <em>(no matter how you might define it, which is not so easy)</em> certainly wouldn&#8217;t shift from non-zero to zero if the Higgs field were turned off.  So this statement doesn&#8217;t make sense.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">It was in the 1960s</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Correct! (phew)</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">that Scottish physicist</span></p>
<ul>
<li>English (according to all my sources, including his <a href="http://www.ph.ed.ac.uk/higgs/peter-higgs" target="_blank">CV</a> and Wikipedia &#8212; didn&#8217;t they do any fact-checking at TIME? this wasn&#8217;t difficult&#8230;); works in Scotland</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">Peter Higgs</span></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/jul/04/higgs-boson-nobel-prize-headache" target="_blank">and also Englert and Brout, and also Guralnik, Hagen and Kibble </a>(and actually the history is a lot more subtle even than that); please give these other folks <em>some</em> credit, by saying &#8220;Higgs and others&#8221; or something like that!</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">first posited the existence of a particle</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Field! and then Higgs noted (slightly later) that it would have a particle as a consequence.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">that causes energy to make the jump to matter.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The Higgs field does not cause energy to become matter.  Both the language and the meaning are wrong; the writer has fallen into classic traps that I&#8217;ve written about extensively (see <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/mass-and-energy/" target="_blank">this link</a> and <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/matter-and-energy-a-false-dichotomy/" target="_blank">this link</a>).  What happens when the Higgs field becomes non-zero is that certain types of massless elementary particles end up having some mass.   What&#8217;s wrong with the writer&#8217;s language? <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/matter-and-energy-a-false-dichotomy/" target="_blank">Energy is not the same thing as massless particles</a>; rather, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/mass-and-energy/" target="_blank">energy is something that particles can <em>have</em>, whether they have mass or not</a>.  And &#8220;mass&#8221; and &#8220;matter&#8221; are not the same thing; <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/matter-and-energy-a-false-dichotomy/" target="_blank">&#8220;matter&#8221;, in fact, is ambiguous as a term</a>, but generally is related to the notion of <em>ordinary material</em> made from atoms or their constituents, while <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/mass-and-energy/" target="_blank">mass is again something that particles can <em>have</em>, whether those particles make up matter or not</a>.  <em>[For example, top anti-quarks are not part of matter, <a title="Matter and Energy: A False Dichotomy" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/matter-and-energy-a-false-dichotomy/" target="_blank">by most definitions of &#8220;matter&#8221;</a>, but they certainly have mass! all of it obtained from the Higgs field(s).)]</em> I often feel that physicists do a bad job of making these points clear to the public, and I fear we&#8217;re largely responsible for these confusions, along with high-school science classes.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">But it was not until last summer that a team of researchers at Europe’s Large Hadron Collider — Rolf Heuer, Joseph Incandela and Fabiola Gianotti —</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Oh wow.  TIME OUT!!!   This is bad.  Thousands of people on two huge teams (CMS and ATLAS) worked for many, many years to make this possible; hundreds were directly involved in the discovery.  Yet somehow the writer imagines that this all was carried out by three people?!?  The latter two are the currently-<em>elected spokespersons</em> for their teams, but they are not somehow responsible for the majority of the work (for although they are very highly respected scientists, they couldn&#8217;t possibly have the time!) and the third, Rolf Heuer, who currently directs the CERN laboratory, does not do research on the Large Hadron Collider at all!   What is sad about this is that erases the contribution of many great scientists, and it completely loses sight of what an incredible and historic collaborative effort was involved in this discovery.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">at last sealed the deal and in so doing finally fully confirmed Einstein’s general theory of relativity.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Oh woe.  Oh woe.  Oh calamity.  SO wrong.  Definitely the most disastrous mistake of them all.  There&#8217;s <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/10/15/why-the-higgs-and-gravity-are-unrelated/" target="_blank">zero/zilch/nada/no-way/nothing to connect the Higgs story with gravity</a>, which is what Einstein&#8217;s general relativity is about.  The discovery of the Higgs particle changes nothing in our understanding of general relativity.  And hey, general relativity is <em>already</em> fairly well confirmed (though one never stops testing a theory for weak points; it took hundreds of years to find a weak point in Newton&#8217;s.)  Repeat:<a title="Why the Higgs and Gravity are Unrelated" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/10/15/why-the-higgs-and-gravity-are-unrelated/" target="_blank"> there is no obvious or direct connection between the Higgs field, or its particle, and gravity</a>!  Discovery of the Higgs particle merely represents (partial) confirmation of the idea that the masses of various elementary particles come from a Higgs field (or fields).</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">The Higgs — as particles do —</span></p>
<ul>
<li>as <a title="Most Particles Decay — Yet Some Don’t!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/why-do-particles-decay/most-particles-decay-yet-some-dont/" target="_blank"><em>most but fortunately not all</em></a> particles do &#8212; I suspect the writer meant this, but it&#8217;s not so clear&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">immediately decayed to more-fundamental particles,</span></p>
<ul>
<li>No! This is a common and <em>very natural</em> misconception; the writer is by no means alone in being confused on this point.   Our ordinary daily-life intuition would suggest that fundamental (or &#8220;elementary&#8221;, a term I much prefer) objects should not be able to fall apart into other fundamental objects &#8212; that the ability to fall apart is limited to objects that are composites constructed out of other objects, the way a wall can fall apart into its constituent bricks.  But for particles, <strong><em>decay is not a falling-apart</em></strong>.  It is a transformation.  And so yes, fundamental objects can in fact decay/disintegrate/transform into two or more objects that are just as fundamental (or even may be <em>less</em>-fundamental!)  What is required to make the decay possible is that <a title="Most Particles Decay — Yet Some Don’t!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/why-do-particles-decay/most-particles-decay-yet-some-dont/" target="_blank">the sum of their masses of the decay products is smaller than the mass of the decaying object; a few other rules must be obeyed as well</a>.  Other rules determine whether a particular decay pattern is <em>likely</em>, but that gets more technical.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">but the scientists would surely be happy to collect any honors or awards in its stead.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>True.  But I really think they&#8217;d be a little embarrassed about this award.  I don&#8217;t think a particle should be Person of the Year.  That&#8217;s just plain silly.  Discovery of the Year?  Maybe!</li>
</ul>
<p>Hahaha; ok, we&#8217;ve had our laughs.  But now what I want to know is what more we scientists can do to change a bad situation.  Although the writer and the editors at TIME made avoidable serious errors in this little paragraph, it&#8217;s by no means entirely their fault that this happened. Is there more that we &#8212; scientists and journalists &#8212; can do to open up the communication channels?  Can we work to eliminate some of the inaccurate short-cuts in what we scientists tell the public, often via the journalism community?  How can we make this kind of trust-eroding mistake less likely?</p>
<p>Suggestions welcome.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the field of particle physics, the word &#8220;workshop&#8221; has a rather broad usage; some workshops are just conferences with a little bit of time for discussion or some other additional feature.  But some workshops are about WORK&#8230;. typically morning-til-night work.  This includes the one I just attended at the Perimeter Institute (PI) in Waterloo, Canada, which brought particle experimentalists from the CMS experiment (one of the two general-purpose experiments at the Large Hadron Collider [LHC] &#8212; the other being ATLAS) together with some particle theorists like myself.  In fact, it was one of the most productive workshops I&#8217;ve ever participated in.</p>
<p>The workshop was organized by the PI&#8217;s young theoretical particle physics professors, Philip Schuster and Natalia Toro, along with CMS&#8217;s current spokesman Joseph Incandela and physics coordinator Greg Landsberg. (Incandela, professor at the University of California at Santa Barbara, is now famous for giving CMS&#8217;s talk July 4th announcing the observation of a Higgs-like particle; ATLAS&#8217;s talk was given by Fabiola Gianotti. Landsberg is a senior professor at Brown University.) Other participants included many of the current &#8220;conveners&#8221; from CMS &#8212; typically very experienced and skilled people who&#8217;ve been selected to help supervise segments of the research program &#8212; and a couple of dozen LHC theorists, mostly under the age of 40, who are experienced in communicating with LHC experimenters about their measurements. <span id="more-4147"></span></p>
<p>The stated aim of the workshop was to try to help the CMS experiment define and sharpen the goals of its research program for the coming year or two.  Obviously a group of forty to fifty people can&#8217;t hope to represent the thousands of CMS experimenters and hundreds of particle theorists that one can find around the world &#8212; so the outcome of such a workshop can only be a set of tentative suggestions for the full CMS experiment to consider in its planning.  But this combination of people seemed especially well-suited for an efficient exchange of sophisticated ideas.  I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m not alone among the workshop participants in feeling that I learned a great deal from the other attendees&#8217; individual and collective wisdom and knowledge.</p>
<p>I also thought that the workshop was very well-organized &#8212; with a small number of talks to lay important topics out on the table, followed by discussion sessions that split the participants  into smaller focus groups.   The atmosphere was intense: informal discussion continued even over lunch and coffee breaks, and often was heard at breakfast and dinner too.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really for CMS to decide whether to make the conclusions public, so I&#8217;ll give you instead a broader sense of what was discussed and how it seems to me to fit together scientifically.  There were (very roughly) four main topics <em>[you may also want to read about <a title="Professor Peskin’s Four Slogans: Advice for the 2012 LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/22/professor-peskins-four-slogans-advice-for-the-2012-lhc/">Professor Peskin&#8217;s Slogans for 2012</a>]</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>studying <a title="Discovery of the Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-discovery-of-the-higgs/">the recently discovered Higgs-like particle</a></li>
<li>searching for signs that the universe is or is not &#8220;natural&#8221;, a confusing term I&#8217;ll explain below</li>
<li>making careful and detailed checks of the predictions of the Standard Model (the set of equations that describes <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the known particle and forces.</a>)</li>
<li>thinking carefully about exotic particles that, if they exist, would require specialized measurement techniques to identify</li>
</ul>
<p>and there&#8217;s a fifth topic that underlies them all: <a title="The Trigger: Discarding All But the Gold" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/the-trigger-discarding-all-but-the-gold/" target="_blank">triggering</a>.  I&#8217;ll describe the first four of these now, and hold the last for a later post.</p>

The two main thrusts of discussion were the Higgs-like particle and the partner particles expected in theories that try to resolve the &#8220;naturalness&#8221; puzzle. Standard Model predictions and measurements are needed for almost any discovery at the LHC. Weird signals from exotic new particles could cause various experimental challenges, and possibly could impact studies of the Higgs or searches for partner particles. Underlying all of these topics is the issue of triggering.</p></div>
<p><strong>The Higgs-Like Particle:</strong> obviously, everything about this particle needs to be studied.  Precision measurements of how it is produced and how it decays are needed&#8230; including <strong>both</strong> production and decay modes that are expected for <a title="The Standard Model Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/" target="_blank">the simplest type of Higgs</a> and most other types <strong>and</strong> <em>(<a title="Exotic Higgs Decays: Making the Case" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/05/30/exotic-higgs-decays-making-the-case/" target="_blank">as I&#8217;ve discussed on this website</a>)</em> exotic modes of production and decay that are not expected for the simplest Higgs (and many other types.)  And we also need to look for cousins that this particle might have: additional Higgs-like particles that might be harder to find than this first one.</p>
<p><strong>Naturalness-inspired particles:</strong> &#8220;Naturalness&#8221;, and the related &#8220;<a title="The Hierarchy Problem" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/" target="_blank">hierarchy problem</a>&#8221;, deserve long explanations which I can&#8217;t give here, so here&#8217;s the short and unsatisfying explanation of what this means.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve just discovered what appears likely to be a Higgs particle, a particle of spin zero and a mass of 125 GeV/c<sup>2</sup>; (which means its mass-energy E = m c<sup>2</sup>, or &#8220;rest-energy&#8221;, is 125 GeV.)  Everything we know about spin-zero particles from theory and past experiments tells us that a particle of this type should most &#8220;naturally&#8221; &#8212; meaning &#8220;generically&#8221; &#8212; be accompanied by additional new particles that we haven&#8217;t yet found.  More specifically, for the known particles whose large mass is due, entirely or partly, to the particle&#8217;s fairly strong interaction with the Higgs field &#8212; the W, the Z, the top, and the Higgs itself (shorthand to be used below: W/Z/t/H)&#8212; there may well be &#8220;partner&#8221; particles, light enough to be accessible at the LHC. These partners are affected by the known forces in similar ways; for example, just as the top quark has electric charge that is 2/3 the charge of the proton, and is affected by the strong nuclear force, the same would be true of its partner.  However, the known particles and their partners may have different spin.  [For example, the partner of the top quark or of the Higgs would probably be spin-1/2 or spin-0; the partners of the W and Z would probably be spin-1/2 or spin-1.]  There might be partners for other particles too, but possibly not accessible at the LHC. If the known particles have the right types of partners, then it becomes generic (i.e. natural) for the value of the Higgs field to be small but not zero, and for the mass of the Higgs particle to be small, relative to other even higher energy scales, such as the scale at which gravity&#8217;s effects on an elementary particle become strong &#8212; a thousand million million bigger than the mass-energy of the Higgs.  Well, this is a long story, but the point is that if naturalness is a good guide &#8212; and it may not be &#8212; then we generally expect to find partner particles at the LHC of some type, at least for the heaviest known particles.  Actually finding them can be pretty hard, however.</p>
<p>The best known theory with partner particles is <a title="Supersymmetry — What Is It?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/supersymmetry-what-is-it/" target="_blank">supersymmetry</a>, but extra dimensional theories, composite-Higgs theories, little-Higgs theories, and others have them also.  (In the extra-dimensional case they are called &#8220;<a title="How to Look for Signs of Extra Dimensions" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/extra-dimensions/how-to-look-for-signs-of-extra-dimensions/">Kaluza-Klein partner particles</a>&#8221;.) So experimentally, if you want to try to know whether naturalness is a feature of nature, you want to look for, and either find or exclude, the various types of W/Z/t/H partners.  Maybe you&#8217;d look for other particles&#8217; partners, but there&#8217;s no requirement that they be accessible at the LHC.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s important.  If the partners of the up and down quarks, and of the gluons (shorthand: u/d/g), exist and aren&#8217;t very heavy, they would be easy to produce in proton-proton collisions &#8212; because the protons contain up and down quarks (and anti-quarks) and gluons in abundance.  Conversely, because the heavy W/Z/t/H are essentially absent from the proton, their partners are not so easily made in proton-proton collisions.  And therefore all the searches for supersymmetry, and for similar theories, that have been carried out so far at the LHC are sensitive more to the u/d/g partners than to the partners of the W/Z/t/H.  The fact that they&#8217;ve turned up nothing only tells us that the u/d/g partners, if they exist, are too heavy to make abundantly at the LHC right now; the W/Z/t/H partners might still be waiting for us to find. The problem is that the W/Z/t/H partner particles have low production rates, smaller than the rates for other ordinary processes that mimic them.  On top of that, there are many different scenarios for how they might decay, and we don&#8217;t know what their masses are &#8212; so we have to look for them in many different ways&#8230; dozens, in fact.</p>
<p><strong>Standard Model backgrounds:</strong> for almost any signal of a new phenomena that might show up at the LHC, including production of the Higgs and production of W/Z/t/H partner particles, there are processes in proton-proton collisions involving known particles and forces that will look very, very similar, and often are much more common.  The problem of finding a new phenomenon at the LHC is therefore typically unlike looking for a needle in a haystack; rather, it&#8217;s like looking for some aluminum needles in a haystack full of tin needles.  This isn&#8217;t easy, unless you really know what tin looks like and what aluminum looks like and can find ways to tell the difference.   And since the tin is so prevalent, you need to understand it very, very well; the better you understand it, the more likely you are to recognize a needle that isn&#8217;t made from tin.  So most discoveries we can imagine making with the 2012 data require high-precision calculations, as well as cross-checks of those calculations in real data.</p>
<p><strong>Exotic new particles:</strong> When a proton-proton collision occurs at the center of the CMS detector, the particles that come flying out from the collision pass through the detector&#8217;s many electronic sensors, leaving electronic signals.  These signals are then stored on computer, and converted, using software, into the best possible guess as to where the particles went and what they might have been; this process is called &#8220;reconstruction&#8221;.  But some types of new particles that might be present in nature could look so weird that the software for reconstruction that the experimenters have written might partly or completely fail. However, as long as the experimenters have thought carefully about these weird particles, they can write specialized software to look in their data for signs that they might be present.  Up to now there&#8217;s been limited manpower devoted to these possibilities, which made sense, because there were other things that would be easier to do and seemed less of a long-shot.  But with the first phase of the LHC coming to an end, it&#8217;s important to start bringing these possibilities up a little higher on the priority list.  This is especially so since exotic new particles, unrecognized in the data, could possibly have caused the searches even for the more common signals of naturalness, such as the u/d/g partners, to have failed so far.  So searching for them is important in making sure that a striking new phenomenon hasn&#8217;t escaped notice.</p>
<p><strong>Triggering:</strong>  I&#8217;ll tell you more about this later in the week.  There&#8217;s quite an interesting story here, in which I&#8217;ve had some level of involvement during the first six months of the year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>[A Heads Up: I&#8217;m giving a public lecture <em>about the LHC on </em>Saturday, April 28th, 1 p.m. New York time/10 a.m. Pacific, through the <a href="http://www.mica-vw.org/wiki/index.php/Upcoming_Public_Events" target="_blank">MICA Popular Talks</a> series, held online at the <a href="http://slurl.com/secondlife/StellaNova/217/128/31" target="_blank">Large Auditorium on StellaNova, Second Life</a>; should you miss it, both audio and slides will be posted for you to look at later.]</em></p>
<p>Is <a title="Supersymmetry" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/" target="_blank">supersymmetry</a>, as a symmetry that might explain some of the puzzling aspects of particle physics at the energy scales accessible to the<a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank"> Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC], ruled out yet? If the only thing you&#8217;re interested in is the answer to precisely that question, let me not waste your time: the answer is &#8220;<strong>not yet</strong>&#8221;. But a more interesting answer is that many simple variants of supersymmetry are either ruled out or near death.</p>
<p>Still, the problem with supersymmetry &#8212; and indeed with any really good idea, such as <a title="Extra Dimensions" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/extra-dimensions/" target="_blank">extra dimensions</a>, or a composite Higgs particle &#8212; is that such a basic idea typically can be realized in many different ways. Pizza is a great idea too, but there are a million ways to make one, so you can&#8217;t conclude that nobody makes pizza in town just because you can&#8217;t smell tomatoes. Similarly, to rule out supersymmetry as an idea, you can&#8217;t be satisfied by ruling out the most popular forms of supersymmetry that theorists have invented; you have to rule out <em>all</em> its possible variants. This will take a while, probably a decade.</p>
<p>That said, many of the simplest and popular variants of supersymmetry no longer work very well or at all. This is because of two things: (<a title="Where Stands Supersymmetry (as of 4/2012)?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/where-stands-supersymmetry-as-of-42012/">click here to read the rest of the article.</a>)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Monday, during the concluding session of the <a title="At the SEARCH Workshop on the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/18/at-the-search-workshop-on-the-lhc/" target="_blank">SEARCH Workshop</a> on <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC] physics (see also <a title="Latest from the SEARCH Workshop" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/20/latest-from-the-search-workshop/" target="_blank">here</a> for a second post), and at the start of the panel discussion involving a group of six theorists, Michael Peskin, professor of theoretical particle physics at the <a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Stanford Linear Accelerator Center</a> <em>[and my Ph.D. advisor]</em> opened the panel with a few powerpoint slides.  He entitled them: &#8220;My Advice in Four Slogans&#8221; &#8212; the advice in question being aimed at experimentalists at ATLAS and CMS (the two general-purpose experiments at the LHC) as to how they ought best to search for new phenomena at the LHC in 2012, and beyond. Since I agree strongly with his points (as I believe most LHC theory experts do), I thought I&#8217;d tell you those four slogans and explain what they mean, at least to me. <em>[I&#8217;m told the panel discussion will be posted online soon.]</em></p>
<p><strong>1. No Boson Left Behind</strong></p>
<p>There is a tendency in the LHC experimental community to assume that the new particles that we are looking for are heavy &#8212; heavier than any we&#8217;ve ever produced before. However, it is equally possible that there are unknown particles that are rather lightweight, but have evaded detection because they interact very weakly with <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the particles that we already know about</a>, and in particular very weakly with the <a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/" target="_blank">quarks and antiquarks and gluons that make up the proton</a>.</p>
<p>Peskin&#8217;s advice is thus a warning: <em><strong>don&#8217;t just rush ahead to look for the heavy particles; remember the lightweight but hard-to-find particles you may have missed.</strong></em></p>
<p>The word &#8220;boson&#8221; here is a minor point, I think. All particles are either <a title="Fermions and Bosons" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/fermions-and-bosons/" target="_blank">fermions or bosons</a>; I&#8217;d personally say that Peskin&#8217;s slogan applies to certain fermions too.</p>
<p><strong>2. Exclude Triangles Not Points</strong></p>
<p>The meaning of this slogan is a less obscure than the slogan itself.  Its general message is this: if one is looking for signs of a new hypothetical particle which</p>
<ul>
<li>is produced mostly or always in particle-antiparticle pairs, and</li>
<li>can decay in multiple ways,</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>one has to remember to search for collisions where the particle decays one way and the antiparticle decays a different way</em></strong>; the probability for this to occur can be high.  Most LHC searches have so far been aimed at those cases where both particle and anti-particle decay in the same way.  This approach can in some cases be quite inefficient.   In fact, <em><strong>to search efficiently, one must combine all the different search strategies.</strong></em></p>
<p>Now what does this have to do with triangles and points?  If you&#8217;d like to know, jump to the very end of this post, where I explain the example that motivated this wording of the slogan.  For those not interested in those technical details, let&#8217;s go to the next slogan.</p>
<p><strong>3. Higgs Implies Higgs in BSM</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Standard Model is the set of equations used to predict the behavior of all <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the known particles and forces</a>, along with the simplest possible type of Higgs particle (<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/" target="_blank">the Standard Model Higgs</a>.) Any other phenomenon is <strong>by definition</strong> Beyond the Standard Model: <strong>BSM</strong>.]</em></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff6600;"><em> [And yes, one may think of the LHC as a machine for converting theorists&#8217; B(SM) speculations into (BS)M speculations.]</em></span></p>
<p>One of the main goals of the LHC is to find evidence of one or more types of Higgs particles that may be found in nature.  There are two main phases to this search, Phase 1 being the search for the &#8220;Standard Model Higgs&#8221;, and Phase 2 depending on the result of Phase 1.  You can read <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2011/12/06/guest-post-matt-strassler-on-hunting-for-the-higgs/" target="_blank">more about this here</a>.</p>
<p>Peskin&#8217;s point is that <em><strong>the Higgs particle may </strong></em><strong>itself</strong><em><strong> be a beacon, signalling new phenomena not predicted by the Standard Model</strong></em>. It is common in many BSM theories that there are new ways of producing the Higgs particle, typically in decays of as-yet-unknown heavy particles. Some of the resulting phenomena may be quite easy to discover, if one simply remembers to look!</p>
<p>Think what a coup it would be to discover not only the Higgs particle but also an unexpected way of making it! Two Nobel prize-winning discoveries for the price of one!!</p>
<p>Another equally important way to read this slogan <em>(and I&#8217;m not sure why Peskin didn&#8217;t mention it &#8212; maybe it was too obvious, and indeed every panel member said something about this during the following discussion)</em> is that everything about the Higgs particle needs to be studied in very great detail. Most BSM theories predict that the Higgs particle <strong>will</strong> behave differently from what is predicted in the Standard Model, possibly in subtle ways, possibly in dramatic ways. Either its <a title="Production of the Standard Model Higgs Particle" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/production-of-the-standard-model-higgs-particle/" target="_blank">production mechanisms</a> or its <a title="Decays of the Standard Model Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/decays-of-the-standard-model-higgs/" target="_blank">decay rates</a>, or both, may easily be altered. So we should not assume that a Higgs particle that <em>looks</em> at first like a Standard Model Higgs actually <em>is</em> a Standard Model Higgs. <em>(I&#8217;ve written about this <a title="Seeking and Studying the Standard Model Higgs Particle" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/seeking-and-studying-the-standard-model-higgs-particle/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a title="Exotic Decays of the Higgs: A High Priority for 2012" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/01/27/exotic-decays-of-the-higgs-a-high-priority-for-2012/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a title="Lightweight Higgs: A `Sensitive Creature’" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/lightweight-higgs-a-sensitive-creature/" target="_blank">here</a>.)</em> <strong><em> Even a particle that looks very much like a Standard Model Higgs may offer, through precise measurements, the first opportunity to dethrone the Standard Model.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>4. BSM Hides Beneath Top</strong></p>
<p>At the <a title="The Tevatron Comes to an End" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/09/30/the-tevatron-comes-to-an-end/" target="_blank">Tevatron</a>, the LHC&#8217;s predecessor,  top quark/anti-quark pairs were first discovered, but were rather rare. But the LHC has so much energy per collision that it has no trouble producing these particles. ATLAS and CMS have each witnessed about 800,000 top quark/anti-quark pairs so far.</p>
<p>Of course, this is great news, because the huge amount of LHC data on top quarks from 2011 allowed measurements of the top quark&#8217;s properties that are far more precise than we had previously. <em>(I wrote about this <a title="News from La Thuile, with Much More to Come" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/05/news-from-la-thuile-with-much-more-to-come/" target="_blank">here</a>.)</em> But there&#8217;s a drawback. Certain types of new phenomena that might be present in nature may be very hard to recognize, because the rare collisions that contain them look too similar to the common collisions that contain a top quark/anti-quark pair.</p>
<p>Peskin&#8217;s message is that the <strong><em>LHC</em></strong> <strong><em>experimenters need to do very precise measurements of all the data from collisions that appear to contain the debris from top quarks, just in case it&#8217;s a little bit different from what the Standard Model predicts.</em></strong></p>
<p><em>A classic example of this problem involves the search for a <a title="Supersymmetry" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/" target="_blank">supersymmetric</a> partner of a top quark, the &#8220;top squark&#8221;. Unlike the t&#8217; quark that I described a couple of slogans back, which would be produced with a fairly high rate and would be relatively easy to notice, top squarks would be produced with a rate that is several times smaller. [Technically, this has to do with the fact that the t&#8217; would have spin-1/2 and the top squark would have spin 0.] Unfortunately, if the mass of the top squark is not very different from the mass of the top quark, then collisions that produce top squarks may look very similar indeed to ones that produce top quarks, and it may be a big struggle to separate them in the data. The only way to do it is to work hard &#8212; to make very precise measurements and perhaps better calculations that can allow one to tell the subtle differences between a pile of data that contains both top quark/anti-quark pairs and top squark/anti-squark pairs, and a pile of data that contains no squarks at all.</em></p>
<p><strong>Following up on slogan #2: An example with a triangle.</strong></p>
<p>Ok, now let&#8217;s see why the second slogan has something to do with triangles.</p>
<p>One type of particle that has been widely hypothesized over the years is a heavy version of the top quark, often given the unimaginative name of &#8220;top-prime.&#8221; For short, top is written <strong>t</strong>, so top-prime is written <strong>t&#8217;</strong>. The t&#8217; may decay in various possible ways. I won&#8217;t list all of them, but three important ones that show up in many speculative theories are</p>
<ul>
<li>t&#8217; → W particle + bottom quark   (t&#8217; → Wb)</li>
<li>t&#8217; → Z particle + top quark      (t&#8217; → Zt)</li>
<li>t&#8217; → Higgs particle + top quark    (t&#8217; → ht)</li>
</ul>
<p>But we don&#8217;t know <strong>how often</strong> t&#8217; quarks decay to Wb, or to Zt, or to ht; that&#8217;s something we&#8217;ll have to measure. <em>[Let&#8217;s call the probability that a t&#8217; decays to Wb &#8220;P<sub>1</sub>&#8221;, and similarly define P<span style="font-size:xx-small;"><span style="line-height:10px;">2</span></span> and P<span style="font-size:xx-small;"><span style="line-height:10px;">3</span></span> for Zt and ht].</em></p>
<p>Of course we have to look for the darn thing first; maybe there is no t&#8217;. Unfortunately, <em><strong>how we should look for it depends on <em>P<sub>1</sub></em><em>,<sub> </sub></em><em><em>P<span style="font-size:xx-small;"><span style="line-height:10px;">2</span></span></em></em>, <em>and P<span style="font-size:xx-small;">3</span></em>, which we don&#8217;t know</strong></em>. For instance, if P<sub>1</sub> is much larger than P<span style="font-size:xx-small;"><span style="line-height:10px;">2</span></span> and P<span style="font-size:xx-small;"><span style="line-height:10px;">3</span></span>, then we should look for collisions that show signs of producing a t&#8217; quark and a <span style="text-decoration:overline;">t</span>&#8216; antiquark decaying as t&#8217; → W<sup>+</sup> b and <span style="text-decoration:overline;">t</span>&#8216; → W<sup>&#8211;</sup> <span style="text-decoration:overline;">b</span>. Or if P<sub>2</sub> is much larger than P<sub>1</sub> and P<sub>3</sub>, we should look for t&#8217; → Zt and <span style="text-decoration:overline;">t</span>&#8216; → Z <span style="text-decoration:overline;">t</span>.</p>

<p>Peskin has drawn this problem of three unknown probabilities, whose sum is 1, as a triangle.  The three vertices of the triangle, labeled by Wb, Zt and ht, represent three extreme cases: P<sub>1</sub>=1 and P<sub>2</sub>=P<sub>3</sub>=0; P<sub>2</sub>=1 and P<sub>1</sub>=P<sub>3</sub>=0; and P<sub>3</sub>=1, P<sub>1</sub>=P<sub>2</sub>=0. Each point inside this triangle represents different possible non-zero values for P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub> and P<sub>3</sub> (with P<sub>1</sub>+P<sub>2</sub>+P<sub>3</sub> assumed to be 1.)  The center of the triangle is P<sub>1</sub>=P<sub>2</sub>=P<sub>3</sub>=1/3.</p>
<p>Peskin&#8217;s point is that if the experiments only look for collisions where both quark and antiquark decay in the same way</p>
<ul>
<li>t&#8217; → W<sup>+</sup> b and <span style="text-decoration:overline;">t</span>&#8216; → W<sup>&#8211;</sup> <span style="text-decoration:overline;">b</span>;</li>
<li>t&#8217; → Zt and <span style="text-decoration:overline;">t</span>&#8216; → Z <span style="text-decoration:overline;">t</span>;</li>
<li>t&#8217; → ht and <span style="text-decoration:overline;">t</span>&#8216; → h <span style="text-decoration:overline;">t</span>;</li>
</ul>
<p>which is what they&#8217;ve done so far, then they&#8217;ll only be sensitive to the cases for which P<sub>1</sub> is by far the largest, P<sub>2</sub> is by far the largest, or P<sub>3</sub> is by far the largest &#8212; the regions near the vertices of the triangle.  But we know a number of very reasonable theories with P<sub>1</sub>=1/2 and P<sub>2</sub>=P<sub>3</sub>=1/4 &#8212; a point deep inside the triangle.  So the experimenters are not yet looking efficiently for this case.  Peskin is saying that to cover the whole triangle, one has add three more searches, for</p>
<ul>
<li>t&#8217; → W<sup>+</sup> b and <span style="text-decoration:overline;">t</span>&#8216; → Z <span style="text-decoration:overline;">t</span>, or t&#8217; → W<sup>&#8211;</sup>  <span style="text-decoration:overline;">b</span> and t&#8217; → Zt;</li>
<li>t&#8217; → W<sup>+</sup> b and <span style="text-decoration:overline;">t</span>&#8216; → h <span style="text-decoration:overline;">t</span>, or <span style="text-decoration:overline;">t</span>&#8216; → W<sup>&#8211;</sup> b  and t&#8217; → ht;</li>
<li>t&#8217; → Zt and <span style="text-decoration:overline;">t</span>&#8216; → h <span style="text-decoration:overline;">t</span>, or t&#8217; → ht or <span style="text-decoration:overline;">t</span>&#8216; → Z <span style="text-decoration:overline;">t</span>;</li>
</ul>
<p>so as to cover that case (and more generally, the whole triangle) efficiently. Moreover, no one search is very effective; one has to combine them all six searches together.</p>
<p>His logic is quite general.  If you have a particle that decays in four different ways, the same logic applies but for a tetrahedron, and you need ten searches; if two different ways, it&#8217;s a line segment, and you need three searches.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At various conferences in the late fall, the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC] experiments ATLAS and CMS showed us many measurements that they made using data they took in spring and summer of 2011. But during the fall their data sets increased in size by a factor of two and a half!  So far this year the only results we&#8217;d seen that involved the 2011 full data set had been <a title="This Week’s Step Forward in the Search for the Higgs Particle" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/02/09/this-weeks-step-forward-in-the-search-for-the-higgs-particle/">ones needed in the search for the Higgs particle</a>. Last week, that started to change.</p>
<p>The spring flood is just beginning. Many new experimental results from the LHC were announced at <a href="http://www.pi.infn.it/lathuile/lathuile_2012.html" target="_blank">La Thuile</a> this past week, some only using part of the 2011 data but a few using all of it, and more and more will be coming every day for the next couple of weeks. And there are also new results coming from the <a title="The Tevatron Comes to an End" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/09/30/the-tevatron-comes-to-an-end/">(now-closed) Tevatron</a> experiments CDF and DZero, which are completing many analyses that use their full data set. In particular, we&#8217;re expecting them to report on their best crack at the Higgs particle later this week. They can only hope to create controversy; they certainly won&#8217;t be able to settle the issue as to whether there is or isn&#8217;t a Higgs particle with a mass of about 125 <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/">GeV</a>/c<sup>2</sup>, as <a title="Reviewing the Search for the Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/01/24/reviewing-the-search-for-the-higgs/" target="_blank">hints from ATLAS and CMS seem to indicate</a>.  But all indications are that it will be an interesting week on the Higgs front.</p>
<p><strong>The Top Quark Checks In</strong></p>

This can be tested using the W decay to an anti-neutron and an electron or muon; the direction that the electron or muon takes can be predicted.  The data above shows excellent agreement between theory and experiment, again validating the theory of the Higgs mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

A precise test of this idea arises as follows. When the top quark decays to a bottom quark and a W particle, and the W then decays to an anti-neutrino and an electron or muon, the probability that the electron or muon travels in a particular direction can be predicted assuming the Higgs mechanism. The data above shows excellent agreement between theory and experiment, validating the notion of the Higgs field.</p></div>
<p>There are now many new measurements of the properties of the top quark, poking and prodding it from all sides (figuratively)  to see if it behaves as expected within the &#8220;Standard Model of particle physics&#8221; [the equations that we use to describe all of <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/">the known particles and forces</a> of nature.] And so far, disappointingly for those of us hoping for clues as to why the top quark is so much heavier than the other quarks, there&#8217;s no sign of anything amiss with those equations. Top quarks and anti-quarks are produced in pairs more or less as expected, with the expected rate, and moving in the expected directions with the expected amount of energy. Top quark decay to a W particle and a bottom quark also agrees, in detail, with theoretical expectation.  Specifically (see Figure 1) the orientation of the W&#8217;s intrinsic angular momentum (called its &#8220;spin&#8221;, technically), a key test of the Standard Model in general and of the <a title="The Higgs FAQ 1.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/360-2/">Higgs mechanism</a> in particular, agrees very well with theoretical predictions.  Meanwhile there&#8217;s no sign that there are unexpected ways of producing top quarks, nor any sign of particles that are heavy cousins of the top quark.</p>
<p>One particularly striking result from CMS relates to the unexpectedly large asymmetry in the production of top quarks observed at the Tevatron experiments, which <a title="Apparent Unexpected Asymmetries in the Production of Quarks" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/tevatron-news/apparent-unexpected-asymmetries-in-the-production-of-quarks/">I&#8217;ve previously written about in detail.</a> The number of top quarks produced moving roughly in the same direction as the <em>proton</em> beam is <strong><em>expected</em></strong> theoretically to be only very slightly larger than the number moving roughly in the same direction as the <em>anti-proton</em> beam, but instead both CDF and DZero <em><strong>observe a</strong> <strong>much larger effect</strong></em>. This significant apparent discrepancy between their measurement and the prediction of the Standard Model has generated lots of interest and hope that perhaps we are seeing a crack in the Standard Model&#8217;s equations.</p>
<p>Well, it isn&#8217;t so easy for CMS and ATLAS to make the same measurement, because the LHC has two proton beams, so it is symmetric front-to-back, unlike the Tevatron with its proton beam and anti-proton beam.   But still, there are other related asymmetries that LHC experiments can measure. And CMS has now looked with its full 2011 data set, and observes&#8230; nothing: for a particular charge asymmetry that they can measure, they find an asymmetry of 0.4% +- 1.0% +- 1.2% (the first number is the best estimate and the latter two numbers are the statistical and systematic uncertainties on that estimate).  The Standard Model predicts something of order a percent or so, while many attempts to explain the Tevatron result might have predicted an effect of several percent.  (ATLAS has presented a similar measurement but only using part of the 2011 data set, so it has much larger uncertainties at present.)</p>
<p>Now CMS is not measuring quite the same thing as CDF and DZero, so the CMS result is not in direct conflict with the Tevatron measurements. But if new phenomena were present that were causing the CDF and DZero&#8217;s anomalously large asymmetry, we&#8217;d expect that by now they&#8217;d be starting to show up, at least a little bit, in this CMS measurement.  The fact that CMS sees not a hint of anything unexpected considerably weakens the overall case that the Tevatron excess asymmetry might have an exciting explanation. It suggests rather that the whole effect is really a problem with the interpretation of the Tevatron measurements themselves, or with the ways that the equations of the Standard Model are used to predict them. That is of course disappointing, but it is still far too early to declare the case closed.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a subtle connection here with the recent<a title="LHCb’s Result From November Appears Confirmed by CDF" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/01/lhcbs-result-from-november-appears-confirmed-by-cdf/"> bolstering by CDF</a> of the <a title="A Notable Discrepancy at the LHCb Experiment" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/11/16/a-notable-discrepancy-at-the-lhcb-experiment/">LHCb experiment&#8217;s claim</a> that CP violation is present in the decays of particles called &#8220;D mesons&#8221;. (D mesons are <a title="What’s a Hadron?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-hadron-as-in-large-hadron-collider/">hadrons</a> containing a <strong>charm</strong> quark [or anti-quark], an <strong>up </strong>or<strong> down</strong> anti-quark [or quark], and [as for all hadrons]<a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/"> lots of additional gluons and quark/anti-quark pairs</a>.) The problem is that theorists, who used to be quite sure that any such CP violation in D mesons would indicate the presence of new phenomena not predicted by the Standard Model, are no longer so sure. So one needs corroborating information from somewhere, showing some other related phenomenon, before getting too excited.</p>
<p>One place that such information might have come from is the top quark.  If there is something surprising in charm quarks (but not in bottom quarks) one might easily imagine that perhaps there is something new affecting all up-type quarks (the up quark, charm quark and top quark) more than the down-type quarks (down, strange and bottom.)  <em>[<a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/">Read here about the known elementary particles and how they are organized.</a>]</em> In other words, if the charm quark is different from expectations and the bottom quark is not, it would seem quite reasonable that the top quark would be even more different from expectations. But  unfortunately, the results from this week suggest the top quark, to the level of precision that can currently be mustered, is behaving very much as the Standard Model predicted it would.</p>
<p><strong>Meanwhile Nothing Else Checks In</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the direct search for new particles not predicted by the Standard Model, there were a number of new results from CMS and ATLAS at La Thuile. The talks on these subjects went flying by; there was far too little information presented to allow understanding of any details, and so without fully studying the corresponding papers I can&#8217;t say anything more intelligent yet than that they didn&#8217;t see anything amiss. But of course, <a title="Some thoughts on why there’s so much Tevatron news." href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/07/21/some-thoughts-on-why-theres-so-much-tevatron-news/">as I&#8217;ve suggested many times</a>, searches of this type wouldn&#8217;t be shown so soon after the data was collected if they indicated any discrepancy with theoretical prediction, unless the discrepancy was spectacularly convincing. More likely, they would be delayed a few weeks or even months, while they were double- and triple-checked, and perhaps even held back for more data to be collected to clarify the situation. So we are left with the question as to which of the other measurements that weren&#8217;t shown are appearing later because, well, some things take longer than others, and which ones (if any) are being actively held back because they are more &#8230; interesting. At this preliminary stage in the conference season it&#8217;s too early to start that guessing game.</p>

But above the Z mass, the data (black dots) show a smooth curve with no significant bumps.</p></div>
<p>So here&#8217;s a few words about what ATLAS and CMS didn&#8217;t see. Several classic searches for supersymmetry and other theories that resemble it (in that they show signs of invisible particles, <a title="Jets: The Manifestation of Quarks and Gluons" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/jets-the-manifestation-of-quarks-and-gluons/">jets from high-energy quarks and gluons</a>, and something rare like a lepton or two or a photon), were updated by CMS for the full or near-full data set. Searches for heavy versions of the top and bottom quark were shown by ATLAS and CMS. ATLAS sought heavy versions of the Z particle (see Figure 2) that decay to a high energy electron/positron pair or muon/anti-muon pair; with their full 2011 data set, they now exclude particles of this type up to masses (depending on the precise details of the particle) of 1.75-1.95 TeV/c<sup>2</sup>. Meanwhile CMS looked for heavy versions of the W particle that can decay to an electron or muon and something invisible; the exclusions reach out above 2.5 TeV/c<sup>2</sup>. Other CMS searches using the full data set included ones seeking new particles decaying to two Z particles, or to a W and a Z.   ATLAS looked for a variety of exotic particles, and CMS looked for events that are very energetic and produce many known particles at once.  Most of these searches were actually ones we&#8217;d seen before, just updated with more data, but a few of them were entirely new.</p>
<p>Two CMS searches worth noting involved looking for new undetectable particles recoiling against a single jet or a single photon. These put very interesting constraints on dark matter that are complementary to the searches that have been going on elsewhere, deep underground.  Using vats of liquid xenon or bubble chambers or solid-state devices, physicists have been looking for the very rare process in which a dark matter particle, one among the vast ocean of dark matter particles in which our galaxy is immersed, bumps into an atomic nucleus inside a detector and makes a tiny little signal for physicists to detect. Remarkable and successful as their search techniques are, there are two obvious contexts in which they work very poorly. If dark matter particles are very lightweight, much lighter than a few GeV/c<sup>2</sup>, the effect of one hitting a nucleus becomes very hard to detect. Or if the nature of the interaction of dark matter with ordinary matter is such that it depends on the spin (the intrinsic angular momentum) of a nucleus rather than on how many protons and neutrons the nucleus contains, then the probability of a collision becomes much, much lower. But in either case, as long as dark matter is affected by the weak nuclear force, the LHC can produce dark matter particles, and though ATLAS and CMS can&#8217;t detect them, they can detect particles that might sometimes recoil against them, such as a photon or a<a title="Jets: The Manifestation of Quarks and Gluons" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/jets-the-manifestation-of-quarks-and-gluons/"> jet</a>. So CMS was quite proud to show that their results are complementary to those other classes of experiments.</p>

<p>Finally, <a title="Something Curious at the Large Hadron Collider" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/10/19/something-curious-at-the-large-hadron-collider/">I made a moderately big deal back in October</a> about a small excess in multi-leptons (collisions that produce three or more electrons, muons, positrons [anti-electrons] or antimuons, <a title="Multi-Lepton Events: A Good Place to Look for New Physics" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/multi-lepton-events-a-good-place-to-look-for-new-physics/">which are a good place to look for new phenomena</a>), though I warned you in bold red letters that <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em><strong>most small excesses go away with more data</strong></em></span>. A snippet of an update was shown at La Thuile, and from what I said earlier about results that appear early in the conference season, you know that&#8217;s bad news. Suffice it to say that although discrepancies with theoretical predictions remain, the ones seen in October apparently haven&#8217;t become more striking. The caveat that most small excesses go away applies, so far, to this data set as well. We&#8217;ll keep watching.</p>
