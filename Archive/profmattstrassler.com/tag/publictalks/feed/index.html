										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For those of you who live in or around Berkshire County, Massachusetts, or know people who do&#8230;</p>
<p>Starting next week I&#8217;ll be giving two free lectures about the LIGO experiment&#8217;s discovery of gravitational waves.  The lectures will be at 1:30 pm on Mondays June 20 and 27, at Berkshire Community College in Pittsfield, MA.  The first lecture will focus on why gravitational waves were expected by scientists, and the second will be on how gravitational waves were discovered, indirectly and then directly.  No math or science background will be assumed.  (These lectures will be similar in style to the ones I gave a couple of years ago concerning the Higgs boson discovery.)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a flyer with the details:  <a href="http://berkshireolli.org/ProfessorMattStrasslerOLLILecturesFlyer.pdf">http://berkshireolli.org/ProfessorMattStrasslerOLLILecturesFlyer.pdf</a></p>

					<description><![CDATA[In the long and careful process of restarting the Large Hadron Collider [LHC] after its two-year nap for upgrades and repairs, another milestone has been reached: protons have once again collided inside the LHC&#8217;s experimental detectors (named ATLAS, CMS, LHCb and &#8230; <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2015/05/06/lhc-starts-collisions-and-a-radio-interview-tonight/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the long and careful process of restarting the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC] after its two-year nap for upgrades and repairs, another milestone has been reached: <a href="http://home.web.cern.ch/about/updates/2015/05/low-energy-collisions-tune-lhc-experiments">protons have once again collided inside the LHC&#8217;s experimental detectors</a> (named ATLAS, CMS, LHCb and ALICE). This is good news, but don&#8217;t get excited yet. It&#8217;s just one small step. These are collisions at the lowest energy at which the LHC operates (450 GeV per proton, to be compared with the 4000 GeV per proton in 2012 and the 6500 GeV per proton they&#8217;ve already achieved in the last month, though in non-colliding beams.) Also the number of protons in the beams, and the number of collisions per second, is still very, very small compared to what will be needed. So discoveries are not imminent!  Yesterday&#8217;s milestone was just one of the many little tests that are made to assure that the LHC is properly set up and ready for the first full-energy collisions, which should start in about a month.</p>
<p>But since full-energy collisions are on the horizon, why not listen to a radio show about what the LHC will be doing after its restart is complete? Today (Wednesday May 6th), <a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/virtually-speaking-science">Virtually Speaking Science</a>, on which I have appeared a couple of times before, will run a program at 5 pm Pacific time (8 pm Eastern). Science writer Alan Boyle will be interviewing me about the LHC&#8217;s plans for the next few months and the coming years. You can listen live, or listen later once they post it.  <a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/virtually-speaking-science/2015/05/07/alan-boyle-matt-strassler-large-hadron-collider">Here&#8217;s the link for the program.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hope all of you had a good holiday and a good start to the New Year!</p>
<p>I myself continue to be extraordinarily busy as we move into 2015, but I am glad to say that some of that activity involves communicating science to the public.  In fact, <strong>a week from today</strong> I will be giving a public talk &#8212; really a short talk and a longer question/answer period &#8212; in Cambridge, just outside of Boston and not far from MIT. This event is a part of the monthly &#8220;CafeSci&#8221; series, which is affiliated with the famous <a href="http://www.wgbh.org/programs/NOVA-16?MM=1">NOVA science television programs</a> produced for decades by <a href="http://www.wgbh.org/">public TV/Radio station WGBH</a> in Boston.</p>
<p>Note for those of you have gone before to CafeSci events: <strong>it will be in a new venue, not far from Kendall Square</strong>. Here&#8217;s the announcement:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Tuesday, January 20th at 7pm (about 1 hour long)<br />
Le Laboratoire Cambridge (NEW LOCATION)<br />
<a href="http://www.lelaboratoirecambridge.com">http://www.lelaboratoirecambridge.com/ </a><br />
650 East Kendall St, Cambridge, MA</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>“The Large Hadron Collider Restarts Soon! What Lies Ahead?&#8221;</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Speaker: Matthew Strassler</p>
<p><span style="color:#800080;"><em>&#8220;After a long nap, the Large Hadron Collider [LHC], where the Higgs particle was discovered in 2012, will begin operating again in 2015, with more powerful collisions than before. Now that we know Higgs particles exist, what do we want to know about them? What methods can we use to answer our questions? And what is the most important puzzle that we are hoping the LHC will help us solve?&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p>Public Transit: Red line to Kendall Square, walk straight down 3rd Street, turn right onto Athenaeum Street, and left onto East Kendall</p>
<p>Parking: There is a parking deck &#8211; the 650 East Kendall Street Garage &#8211; accessible by Linskey Way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Done: All three parts of my lecture for a general audience on String Theory are up now&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Beyond the Hype: The Weird World of String Theory </strong>(Science on Tap, Seattle, WA, September 25, 2006). Though a few years old, this talk is still very topical; it covers the history, development, context and impact of string theory from its earliest beginnings to the (then) present.</p>
<p><em>Be forewarned: although the audio is pretty good, this was an amateur video taken by one of the organizers of the talk, and because the place was small and totally packed with people, it&#8217;s not great quality&#8230; but good enough to follow, I think, so I&#8217;ve posted it.</em></p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://youtu.be/yEkqcQH4zgA" target="_blank">Part 1</a> (10 mins.): String theory&#8217;s beginnings in <a title="What’s a Hadron?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-hadron-as-in-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">hadron</a> physics and the early attempts to use it as a theory of quantum gravity.</li>
<li><a href="http://youtu.be/LYwqCcFS508" target="_blank">Part 2</a> (10 mins.): String theory was shown to be a mathematically consistent candidate for a theory of all of quantum gravity and particle physics, and became a really popular idea.</li>
<li><a href="http://youtu.be/Bhi721-63l4" target="_blank">Part 3</a> (9 mins.): How string theory evolved through the major technical and conceptual advances of the 1990s.</li>
</ol>
<p>By the way, if you&#8217;re interested in other talks I&#8217;ve given for a general audience, you can check out <a title="Movie Clips" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/videoclips/" target="_blank">my video clip</a>s, which include a recent hour-long talk on the Quest for the Higgs Boson.</p>

<p>* If you haven&#8217;t yet seen my one-hour talk for a general audience, &#8220;The Quest for the Higgs Boson&#8221;, intended to explain <em>accurately</em> what the <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">Higgs field and particle</a> are all about, while avoiding the most common misleading short-cuts, <a title="Movie Clips" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/videoclips/" target="_blank">it&#8217;s available now</a>, along with a 20-minute question and answer session.</p>
<p>* If you want a slightly more technical and written discussion of the Higgs field and particle, complete with animated images, and suitable for people who may once have had a semester or two of university physics and math, try <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/fields-and-their-particles-with-math/" target="_blank">this series</a> of articles first, and then go to <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/how-the-higgs-field-works-with-math/" target="_blank">this series</a>.</p>
<p>* If you&#8217;d like to better understand the language of &#8220;matter&#8221;, &#8220;mass&#8221;, and &#8220;energy&#8221; that is everywhere in popular explanations of science, but eternally confusing because of how different authors choose to talk about these subjects, you might find some useful tips in these articles: <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/more-on-mass/" target="_blank">#1</a>, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/mass-and-energy/" target="_blank">#2</a>, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/matter-and-energy-a-false-dichotomy/" target="_blank">#3</a>, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/the-energy-that-holds-things-together/" target="_blank">#4</a>.</p>
<p>* If you need a reminder about what &#8220;ordinary matter&#8221; (i.e. things like pickles, people and planets) is made of, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/" target="_blank">try this series</a>, which goes all the way from molecules down to quarks.</p>
<p>* If you&#8217;re curious about what &#8220;particle/<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/what-are-anti-particles/" target="_blank">anti-particle</a> annihilation&#8221; does and doesn&#8217;t mean, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/particleanti-particle-annihilation/" target="_blank">try this article</a>.</p>
<p>* And here are <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the types of particles and forces of nature that we know about</a>, and (for the moderately advanced reader) here&#8217;s <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/the-known-particles-if-the-higgs-field-were-zero/" target="_blank">how they&#8217;d be rearranged if the Higgs field were turned off</a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully there&#8217;s something on that list that interests you, and many links within those articles to other things that may even interest you more.  Have fun exploring!  And stay tuned; I&#8217;ll be writing more in the near future&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One year ago today, I arrived, bleary-eyed from my overnight flight, at the CERN laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland, host of the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a>.  Everyone at the lab was very excited, anticipating what promised to be the biggest event during my career in particle physics &#8212; the announcement of the discovery, or at least strong evidence, of something resembling a type of <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">Higgs particle</a>.  The <a title="The Day of the Higgs!!!!  DISCOVERY!!! History Made!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/07/04/the-day-of-the-higgs/" target="_blank">following day did not disappoint</a>, nor did the ensuing weeks of thinking and discussion and hard work.  A year later, we no longer wonder <em><strong>whether</strong></em> this is a type of Higgs particle; instead <a title="From “Higgs-like Particle” to “Standard Model-like Higgs”" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/03/15/from-higgs-like-particle-to-standard-model-like-higgs/" target="_blank">we have moved on to ask <strong><em>which</em></strong> type it is</a>, and whether it has cousins &#8212; other types of Higgs particles still waiting to be found.</p>
<p>Since that time, I&#8217;ve been working to find new methods of explaining particle physics, and specifically the Higgs field and particle, to a variety of audiences, with a diversity of backgrounds and with different amounts of time to spare.</p>
<ul>
<li>For the average person who wants a short story, I wrote <a title="Why the Higgs Particle Matters" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/why-the-higgs-particle-matters/" target="_blank">a brief article about &#8220;Why the Higgs Particle Matters&#8221;</a>, my most popular piece ever.</li>
<li>Then I wrote a long sequence of articles &#8212; actually two sequences, one <a title="Fields and Their Particles: With Math" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/fields-and-their-particles-with-math/" target="_blank">about fields and particles</a>, and one specifically <a title="How the Higgs Field Works (with math)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/how-the-higgs-field-works-with-math/" target="_blank">about how the Higgs field works</a> &#8212; intended for people who have had the equivalent of first-year university physics.</li>
<li>I recently <a title="Courses, Forces, and (w)Einstein" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/06/03/courses-forces-and-weinstein/" target="_blank">gave a set of four 90-minute classes</a> intended for highly interested non-experts, assuming little or no background in math or science.</li>
<li>And I developed <span style="color:#800080;"><strong>a new one-hour public talk</strong></span> (see below), entitled &#8220;The Quest for the Higgs Boson&#8221;, for a general audience, in which I tried to explain, as accurately as possible but with no math at all, what fields and particles are, how a Higgs field can give mass to the known elementary particles, and what finding and studying Higgs particles is all about.</li>
</ul>
<p>That one-hour talk was first delivered a few months back, as part of the Nick and Maggie DeWolf Public Lecture Series, at the Wheeler Opera House in Aspen, Colorado.  It was filmed by a local TV station, GrassRoots Community Television.  And they have made this film available online. <strong><a href="http://grassrootstv.org/Show.aspx?ShowID=11527" target="_blank">Click here to reach the GrassRoots TV page</a></strong>, then click &#8220;Watch Now&#8221; on the right-hand side. <em>[It&#8217;s a .wmv file that should, after a little delay, begin streaming; if it doesn&#8217;t, it will laboriously download, which may take quite a while.  In any case you&#8217;ll want a good internet connection. And if it is super-slow, try again another day; their server could easily get overloaded, I suspect.]</em></p>
<p>By the way, the talk is preceded by about 5 minutes of introductory remarks by Professor Howard Haber <a title="4. More Than One Higgs?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/taking-stock-of-the-higgs-jan-2013/4-more-than-one-higgs/" target="_blank">(a Higgs-particle expert who has been mentioned before on this blog)</a>, and concludes with about 20 minutes of questions from the audience, so altogether the film is almost 90 minutes long.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m back, after two weeks of teaching non-experts in a short course covering particle physics, the Higgs field, and the discovery of the Higgs particle.  <em>(The last third of the course, on the politics and funding of particle physics and science more broadly, is wisely being taught by a more disinterested party, an economist with some undergraduate physics background.)</em>  And I&#8217;ve been reminded: <strong><em>One of the great joys (and great secrets) of teaching is that the teacher always learns more than the students do.</em></strong></p>
<p>At least, this is generally true for a new class that the teacher hasn&#8217;t taught before. In many university physics departments, and elsewhere, there is an informal requirement that professors teach a class no more than three years in a row. <em>[Let us ignore for the moment that all of this will be overturned in the coming years by the on-line revolution; we can discuss the possible consequences later.]</em> After the third year, they are expected to switch and teach something else. Now you might think that the benefits of the division of labor would suggest a different approach; after all, shouldn&#8217;t each professor perfect a course, become the expert, and teach it year in, year out? This usually doesn&#8217;t work (though there are exceptions) because each professor&#8217;s interaction with a new course has a natural life cycle.<span id="more-6122"></span></p>
<p>The first time a professor teaches a course, he or she has to review material learned long ago, and sometimes learn it anew. You might think this is only difficult for advanced classes, but that&#8217;s not the case. Advanced classes can indeed be difficult to teach because the material is intrinsically complex. But beginning classes are also difficult to teach because the material, while less complex, is just as complex <em>for the students</em>, and meanwhile the teacher has to remember how to think like a beginner, which is an experience long forgotten. If you can&#8217;t put yourself into your students&#8217; heads, you can&#8217;t teach them very effectively&#8230; and this is extremely challenging.</p>
<p>Typically, this initial year of a course is quite exhausting, with the professor spending many more hours in preparation than in class. (I personally found it typical to spend 3 to 5 hours of preparation for each hour in front of students.) But the benefits are also considerable. I have often found myself learning several different ways of explaining a concept &#8212; my students only get to learn one, because that&#8217;s all the time we have, but I learn them all. And along the way I&#8217;ve often discovered links between disparate concepts that I hadn&#8217;t previously realized were related, or filled in a surprising gap in my understanding, or learned an application of a concept to a real-world phenomenon that I hadn&#8217;t previously known about. Often my students don&#8217;t get the immediate benefit because what I&#8217;ve learned is beyond the scope of the course. So they struggle to learn some fraction of what I teach them, which is typically much less than what I&#8217;ve learned myself.</p>
<p>Year two in the life cycle is the opportunity to fix everything that went wrong in year one, and it is usually the best year. I have usually found myself completely rewriting the first year&#8217;s notes, streamlining them, re-ordering them, and improving everything from the overall course structure to the details of how I explain certain subtle points. And I find I still learn quite a bit in the process, particularly about little loose ends that I didn&#8217;t have time to tie up during the frantic class preparations of the previous go-round.</p>
<p>But by year three, the whole thing is becoming routine. There isn&#8217;t much left for the professor to learn about the class material, and the struggle to master the content and perfect the presentation is no longer so severe. Sure, there&#8217;s always more that can be done to help the students deal with the technical material more effectively, but diminishing returns are setting in; any particularly creative ideas for how to convey the most problematic concepts have probably already appeared. So year three is not quite at the point of boredom&#8230; but <strong><em>beware year four</em></strong>.  And you do not want to be taught <em>anything</em> by a bored professor.</p>
<p>And so the professor is sent on to begin the cycle anew, to re-learn another subject, and to struggle to find the words and means to explain it clearly.</p>
<p>Two years ago, when I first wrote the Higgs FAQ (here&#8217;s <a title="The Old Higgs FAQ" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/360-2/" target="_blank">the old 1.0 version</a> and <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">the new 2.0 version</a>) I didn&#8217;t do a very complete or satisfying job of explaining the most important conceptual issues in particle physics: <strong><em>what are particles and what are fields?</em></strong> One really can&#8217;t understand modern physics, and the current notion of what ordinary matter actually is, what forces are, what mass is, etc., without these basic concepts. I promised a full article on the matter, but didn&#8217;t really deliver. I had done something brief in the my <a title="Movie Clips" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/videoclips/" target="_blank">Secret Science Club presentation</a>, but I didn&#8217;t feel it was as good as I wanted.</p>
<p>Then a bit under a year ago, having learned a great deal from writing articles for this site, from encountering and attempting to answer readers&#8217; questions, and from preparing and delivering a number of public lectures on the search for the Higgs particle, I wrote a set of articles entitled &#8220;<a title="Fields and Their Particles: With Math" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/fields-and-their-particles-with-math/" target="_blank">Fields and Their Particles (with math)</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a title="How the Higgs Field Works (with math)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/how-the-higgs-field-works-with-math/" target="_blank">How the Higgs Field Works (with math)</a>&#8220;, which boiled the issues down to the point that they could be understood by a first-year undergraduate college physics student. At the time, I promised a set of articles without the math, yet found myself unable to find the right strategy to do it. In particular, I did not want to make compromises that would require me to lie. Sure, some amount of compromise is necessary when explaining a difficult concept to someone who&#8217;s never seen anything like it. But that shouldn&#8217;t go as far as telling someone something they will later have to un-learn, or that will confuse them because it is actually false. <em>(For instance: saying &#8220;the Higgs field is like molasses; it gives mass to things by slowing them down&#8221; is a lie. [As one of my students pointed out last week, you&#8217;ll find this lie right at the top of <a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_field" target="_blank">http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_field</a>.] Molasses exerts <strong>drag</strong>, like air resistance; the Higgs field&#8217;s effect is obviously <strong>not</strong> a form of drag, because it affects stationary objects as well as moving ones.)</em></p>
<p>I believe I finally found a workable strategy while preparing a one-hour public lecture this March, and in preparing my recent course, which I described to the students as &#8220;non-technical&#8221; (i.e. no use of math except very simple and conceptual equations, such as <em>E = m c²</em> and <em>E = h f</em>) &#8220;but sophisticated&#8221; (i.e., you can&#8217;t tell the truth and yet make everything as simple and effortless as breathing).  In four 9o-minute lectures, I managed to describe the known particles and forces, explain how both arise from fields (which are the fundamental ingredients of nature), clarify what particles really are and what a particle&#8217;s mass really means, and finally, explain how the Higgs field gives mass to particles; then it wasn&#8217;t that hard to explain how the Higgs particle was discovered and how that discovery convinces us the Higgs field really exists.  And I don&#8217;t believe I lied once, though I should check that&#8230;</p>
<p>As usual, my students&#8217; questions taught me a lot about all of the issues I&#8217;d forgotten to explain, and about little loose ends in my presentation that I hadn&#8217;t tied off.  Though they may not realize it, I owe them a big thank you!  Because now, given what I learned from preparing and teaching the course, I think I can finally begin planning the promised set of articles: &#8220;Fields and Their Particles (<strong>without</strong> math)&#8221;, to be followed by &#8220;How the Higgs Field Works (<strong>without</strong> math)&#8221;.</p>
<p>And meanwhile I hope I&#8217;ll get to teach that course again soon &#8212; since the second time around is when you fix what you messed up the first time&#8230;</p>
