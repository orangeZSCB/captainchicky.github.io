										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, <a title="BICEP2: New Evidence Of Cosmic Inflation!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/bicep2-new-evidence-of-cosmic-inflation/" target="_blank">yesterday was quite a day</a>, and I&#8217;m still sifting through the consequences.</p>
<p>First things first.  As with all major claims of discovery, <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">considerable caution is advised until the BICEP2 measurement has been verified by some other experiment</span></strong>.   Moreover, even if the measurement is correct, <span style="color:#800080;"><strong>one should not assume that the interpretation in terms of gravitational waves and inflation is correct; this requires more study and further confirmation.</strong></span></p>
<p>The media <strong>is</strong> assuming BICEP2&#8217;s measurement is correct, and that the interpretation in terms of inflation is correct, but leading scientists are not so quick to rush to judgment, and are thinking things through carefully.  Scientists are cautious not just because they&#8217;re trained to be thoughtful and careful but also because <em><strong>they&#8217;ve seen many claims of discovery withdrawn or discredited</strong></em>; discoveries are made when humans go where no one has previously gone, with technology that no one has previously used &#8212; and surprises, mistakes, and misinterpretations happen often.</p>
<p>But in this post, I&#8217;m going to <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">assume</span> <span style="color:#ff9900;">assume</span> <span style="color:#0000ff;">assume</span></strong> that BICEP2&#8217;s results are correct, or essentially correct, and are being correctly interpreted.  Let&#8217;s <strong>assume</strong> that <em>[here&#8217;s <a title="A Primer On Today’s Events" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/a-primer-on-todays-events/" target="_blank">a primer on yesterday&#8217;s result that defines these terms</a>]</em></p>
<ul>
<li>they really have detected &#8220;B-mode polarization&#8221; in the &#8220;CMB&#8221; [Cosmic Microwave Background, the photons (particles of light) that are the ancient, cool glow leftover from <a title="Hot Big Bang" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/hot-big-bang/" target="_blank">the Hot Big Bang</a>]</li>
<li>that this B-mode polarization really is a sign of gravitational waves generated during a brief but dramatic period of <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">cosmic inflation</a> that immediately preceded <a title="Hot Big Bang" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/hot-big-bang/" target="_blank">the Hot Big Bang</a>,</li>
</ul>
<p>Then &#8212; <span style="color:#ff0000;">IF</span> BICEP2&#8217;s results were basically right and were being correctly interpreted concerning inflation &#8212; what would be the implications?</p>
<p>Well&#8230;<strong> <em>Wow&#8230;  </em></strong>They&#8217;d really be quite amazing.<span id="more-7493"></span></p>
<p>Would this story be bigger than the <a title="The Day of the Higgs!!!!  DISCOVERY!!! History Made!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/07/04/the-day-of-the-higgs/" target="_blank">discovery of the Higgs particle</a>?  Certainly <em><strong>at least as</strong></em> big.  To try to compare the two gets us into silly discussions; you can&#8217;t know the long-term implications of a discovery at or near the time it is made.  But the immediate list of implications would certainly be longer.</p>
<p><strong>Some Definitions</strong></p>
<p>Before I start: we&#8217;ll need some definitions, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/some-definitions-for-cosmology/" target="_blank">given in this article</a>, of:</p>
<ul>
<li>A unit of energy called GeV (roughly the mass-energy of a hydrogen atom)</li>
<li>The Planck energy, Planck mass and Planck length (processes involving the Planck energy or mass in a region the size of the Planck length will generally involve both quantum mechanics and gravity [&#8220;quantum gravity&#8221;])</li>
<li>The energy scale associated with dark energy (which is not quite the amount of dark energy &#8212; for one thing, despite the name, dark `energy&#8217; is actually an energy per unit volume.)</li>
</ul>
<p>If any of these is unfamiliar to you, you may want to read <a title="Some Definitions for Cosmology" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/some-definitions-for-cosmology/" target="_blank">that article</a> first and to have it handy, in another tab or window, to serve as a glossary.  You may also want to have my <a title="History of the Universe" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/" target="_blank">History of the Universe</a> or my <a title="A Primer On Today’s Events" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/a-primer-on-todays-events/" target="_blank">BICEP2 Discovery Primer</a> hand.</p>
<p><strong>Implications of BICEP2&#8217;s Discovery &#8212;</strong> <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">IF &#8230; IF &#8230;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">IF IF IF</span></strong> BICEP2&#8217;s measurement is correct, at least roughly, and <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">IF IF IF </span></strong>it is being correctly interpreted, at least roughly, then there&#8217;s a long list of broad implications that I can think of, or that others of my colleagues have pointed out to me in conversations.  Some of them are vague &#8212; areas where the implications are likely to be important but are not yet very clear.  Some of these things were already somewhat implied by the previous experimental successes of the theory of inflation, while some stem directly from BICEP2.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>IF &#8230; IF &#8230;</strong></span></p>
<p>A puzzle that bothered scientists for decades, as to how the observable patch of the universe (i.e. the part that we can actually observe today; the universe may be much, much larger than this &#8212; <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">see here</a>) could be so uniform, would indeed be firmly solved, by a period of <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">cosmic inflation</a>.  The extremely flat geometry of the universe would also now be firmly explained.</p>
<p>We would also have confirmation about how the universe became hot &#8212; about how the Hot Big Bang got started.  The picture would be this: a large amount of <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">dark energy first makes the universe big, via inflation, and then the dark energy turns into energetic particles, making the universe hot (and still expanding, albeit more and more slowly</a> [until <a title="A Nobel Prize That’s No Surprise" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/10/04/a-nobel-prize-thats-no-surprise/" target="_blank">relatively recently</a>]).  Some people like to say that inflation puts the &#8220;Bang&#8221; in &#8220;Big Bang&#8221;, but remember that it also makes the universe flat and uniform and huge (typically much larger than the observable patch) before it heats it up.</p>
<p>The existence of cosmic inflation would itself be another feather in the cap of Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity &#8212; since it is Einstein&#8217;s theory that predicts that the presence of a positive cosmological &#8220;constant&#8221; [not necessarily constant], also known as &#8220;dark `energy&#8217; &#8221; [not really energy, but energy density and negative pressure in just the right combination] actually causes the universe to expand, rather than (as we&#8217;d naively expect from gravity) contract.</p>
<p>And <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">(IF&#8230; IF&#8230;)</span></strong> the confirmation of cosmic inflation would mean that those who pointed it out and its advantages, and developed the idea &#8212; people like Starobinsky, Guth, Steinhardt, Linde &#8212; ought to be able to celebrate (though not all will do so, because they abandoned the idea&#8230;)</p>
<p>Also celebrating would be those who pointed out the possibility of a detectable signal from gravitational waves in the polarization of the CMB, which is what BICEP2 has apparently observed.  I believe these would be Kamionkowsi, Kosowsky, Stebbins, Seljak and Zaldarriaga (but the cosmologists should correct me if I&#8217;m unfair here.)</p>
<p>Were there any doubt left concerning Einstein&#8217;s prediction that gravitational waves exist &#8212; perhaps some leftover worry about the 1993-Nobel-Prize-winning indirect detection of energy carried being off by these waves, via <a href="http://www.astro.cardiff.ac.uk/research/gravity/tutorial/?page=3thehulsetaylor" target="_blank">precision measurements of a pulsar, one of a pair of closely-orbiting neutron stars</a> discovered by Hulse and Taylor &#8212; it would be over.</p>
<p>And if anyone still wasn&#8217;t sure that gravity is due to a spin-two field, not  a spin-zero field, the BICEP2 result would settle the matter; you can&#8217;t get B-mode polarization of the CMB without <a title="A Primer On Today’s Events" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/a-primer-on-todays-events/" target="_blank">combining the spin-two polarization structure of the gravitational waves with Thomson scattering</a>.</p>
<p>If there were any doubt that gravity is controlled, just like everything else, by quantum physics, it would erased; BICEP2&#8217;s observation would imply that just like other fields, which are subject to quantum jitter (i.e., random &#8220;<a title="Quantum Fluctuations and Their Energy" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/quantum-fluctuations-and-their-energy/" target="_blank">fluctuations</a>&#8220;), space and time <em>(somewhat more precisely, the metric that determines distances)</em> undergoes the same type of quantum fluctuations as other fields, fluctuations that <em>any</em> quantum version of Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity would predict.  No details about quantum gravity are needed for this conclusion.</p>
<p><span style="color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">The amount of dark energy required during inflation, in order that BICEP2 could observe this gravitational wave signal, would <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>(IF&#8230; IF&#8230;)</strong></span> be enormous.  The energy scale of dark energy [<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/some-definitions-for-cosmology/" target="_blank">defined here</a>] would be about 10<sup>16</sup> GeV, just about 100 times less than the absolute maximum possible, which is the (reduced) Planck scale.  This need not have been the case!   This energy scale  could have been trillions of times smaller, and yet still given acceptable amounts of inflation of the universe and an acceptable Hot Big BAng.  </span>Amazingly, the dark energy during inflation, if BICEP2 is right, is much larger than it <em>needed</em> to be, and almost as large as it could <em>possibly</em> be!</p>
<p><span style="color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">Moreover, if the energy scale of dark energy [<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/some-definitions-for-cosmology/" target="_blank">defined here</a>] had been just a few times weaker than BICEP2 observes &#8212; 1000 times less than the absolute maximum &#8212; then the gravitational wave signal would have been so faint that it would have been completely drowned out by another process (<a title="A Primer On Today’s Events" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/a-primer-on-todays-events/" target="_blank">lensing of E-mode polarization</a>, the solid red curve on the <a title="BICEP2: New Evidence Of Cosmic Inflation!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/bicep2-new-evidence-of-cosmic-inflation/" target="_blank">first figure here</a>.)  So most of us thought, with this wide range of possibilities, that it was a real long shot that BICEP2, or any future similar experiment, would ever see any signal due to gravitational waves from inflation.  That the gravitational waves would turn out to be large and powerful enough to be observed would be an amazing piece of luck for scientists wanting to understand the universe.  (<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">IF&#8230; IF&#8230;</span></strong>)</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff6600;"><em>[The original version of this paragraph overstated what we&#8217;d know; thanks to my colleagues for pointing out a blunder concerning the heating after inflation.]</em> </span> Also, this would mean we would now have an estimate for how hot the observable patch of the universe could have become <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">after inflation ended and the region containing the observable patch became very hot</a> &#8212; the start of the Hot Big Bang.  The energy scale of the dark energy during inflation determines the maximum possible temperature at the start of the Hot Big Bang, more or less.  To say it another way: after inflation with dark energy of scale 10<sup>16</sup> GeV ended, the universe would have become hot, potentially so hot that the average particle rushing around in the hot dense soup of particles had a motion-energy of 10<sup>16</sup> GeV, though perhaps quite a bit less than this.  That&#8217;s a maximum temperature of as much as 10<sup>29</sup> degrees [yes, that&#8217;s a 1 with 29 zeroes after it!!!]</p>
<p>The Large Hadron Collider&#8217;s data provide direct insights into physics at the energy scale of around 1000 GeV or so.  [The mass-energy mc² of the Higgs particle is 125 GeV.]  The BICEP2 measurement would arguably be our first direct evidence (<span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>IF&#8230; IF&#8230;</strong></span>) concerning physics at higher energy scales than the LHC <em>(though one could argue we have a little information from the existence of neutrino masses.)</em>  And not just a little higher!  Since the scale of the dark energy at inflation is at 10<sup>16</sup> GeV, we&#8217;re talking <strong>10,000,000,000,000 times higher</strong>!!!  We&#8217;ve been trying for years, using various methods, to find evidence concerning how physics works at or near the Planck energy and Planck length.  All previous efforts have come up with nothing; proton decay might have given us insight, but it is too rare if it happens at all; neutrino oscillations haven&#8217;t given a clear pictures; cosmology might have revealed big surprises concerning the Planck energy, but none have previously shown up.  But if BICEP2 is right, then, for the first time, we are seeing phenomena which occurred near this energy scale!</p>
<p>Similarly, data from cosmology has made us very confident that we understand physics in the early universe back to the time when the first <a title="The Nuclei of Atoms: At the Heart of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-nuclei-of-atoms-at-the-heart-of-matter/" target="_blank">atomic nuclei</a> formed during the Hot Big Bang &#8212; a few minutes after the Hot Big Bang started, when the temperature was such that the typical particles had energy of about 0.001 GeV.  And we have had <em>reasonable</em> confidence that we have a decent understanding, using what we&#8217;ve learned about particle physics recently, back to times of a billionth of a second, and temperatures corresponding to an energy of a hundred GeV or so.  But now our understanding may be taking (<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">IF&#8230; IF&#8230;</span></strong>) an enormous leap, back to the very start of the Hot Big Bang, at a temperature corrresponding to an energy of as much as 10<sup>16</sup> GeV, and even earlier, into the frigid inflating universe.</p>
<p>The success of the details of the equations that form the heart of inflationary theory suggests that not only did Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity describe physics at very early times and very high energy scales, the basic principles of quantum field theory worked back then too.  It could easily have been imagined &#8212; and many have imagined, with concrete ideas backed up with equations &#8212; that there might be important principles that we are unaware of, or modifications of the ones we know, that would give very different predictions from standard inflationary theory.  So far, there&#8217;s no sign of that at all.  BICEP2&#8217;s result (<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">IF&#8230; IF&#8230;</span></strong>) would be yet another sign that despite having done all our particle physics and gravity measurements at much lower energy scales and longer distances, those accessible to the LHC and to our previous experiments, we&#8217;ve actually understood the principles that govern the behavior of phenomena at much, much higher energy scales and much shorter distances!</p>
<p>The energy scale inferred from BICEP2&#8217;s measurement, 100 times smaller than the Planck energy &#8212; 10<sup>16</sup> GeV or so &#8212; has appeared in particle physics before!  If you take the three non-gravitational forces of nature &#8212; <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force and the electromagnetic force</a> &#8212; and you first consider <a title="The Known Particles — If The Higgs Field Were Zero" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/the-known-particles-if-the-higgs-field-were-zero/" target="_blank">how they are rearranged when the Higgs field is turned off, into strong nuclear, weak isospin, and hypercharge forces</a> &#8212; and then you look at <a title="The Strengths of the Known Forces" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-forces-of-nature/the-strength-of-the-known-forces/" target="_blank">how the strengths of the forces drift</a> as you study them at shorter and shorter distances and higher and higher energies, you find the forces all become about the same strength at an energy scale of about 10<sup>16</sup> GeV or so.  This is called &#8220;unification of coupling constants&#8221; (i.e. force strengths) &#8212; or, originally and more ambitiously, &#8220;grand unification&#8221;, a grander notion that the three non-gravitational forces are actually manifestations of just one type of force.  <em>[Unification of that unified force with gravity is yet another question; that&#8217;s what string theory might do, though string theory does not require grand unification be a separate process from the unification with gravity.]</em>  Originally, back around 1980, inflation was imagined to be associated with grand unification, and if so, would have an energy scale of about &#8230; yes, 10<sup>16</sup> GeV or so.  But that idea died out long ago as people learned more about both unification and inflation.  Yet now we must wonder: could that part of the original idea, in some vague way, have actually been right?</p>
<p>Over the years, scientists have invented a plethora of variations on how inflation might have, in detail, taken place.  BICEP2&#8217;s observation of a gravitational wave signature would sweep away most of them, leaving just a few.  (More will be invented in coming months, though!)  It also would sweep away some alternatives to inflation and many speculative ideas for how the universe might behave, or might at least have behaved at earlier times.  Despite &#8220;tension&#8221; (meaning mild disagreement) between BICPS2s current data and the Planck satellite&#8217;s data, a rather simple observable patch of universe, with rather simple laws of nature and a rather simple form of inflation, are consistent with what we know.</p>
<p>One of the variants of inflation that would be excluded by BICEP2&#8217;s data is the notion (admittedly long-shot anyway) that actually the Higgs field could play the role of the inflaton after all.   It turns out that no observably large gravitational wave signal would be expected if that were true.</p>
<p>BICEP2&#8217;s result would represent the first time that, without any theoretical speculation about quantum gravity, an experiment has <strong>forced</strong> us to consider processes involving physics at the Planck scale, where quantum gravity is important.  Specifically, for a variant of inflation to give such a large gravitational wave signal <em>relative</em> to the size of the other non-uniformities in the cosmic microwave background, the Planck energy scale becomes important.  The inflaton field, which (by definition) is the field whose stored &#8220;<a title="The Energy That Holds Things Together" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/the-energy-that-holds-things-together/" target="_blank">potential energy</a>&#8221; <strong>is</strong> the dark energy, must change by an amount close to or a bit larger than the Planck energy scale. <em>[Sorry for the necessary technical-speak here. </em><em>This whole business is inherently confusing for non-experts.  The dark energy <strong>may change or may not change at all</strong> while the inflaton field is changing; that&#8217;s a separate question.  What it means for a field like an inflaton to change by the Planck energy scale is that if a particle interacted with the inflaton field as strongly as it possibly could (the way the electron interacts with the Higgs field, but stronger), then as the inflaton field changed by an amount comparable to the Planck energy scale, the particle&#8217;s mass would change by an amount comparable to the Planck mass.]</em></p>
<p>An extremely simple possibility for inflation that would still be consistent with all the data <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">(IF&#8230; IF&#8230;)</span></strong> is just to have a spin-zero field (a bit like the <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">Higgs field</a>, but with important differences &#8212; no weak nuclear force effects, for instance) which has a mass and no substantial interactions with any other fields.  This is a model introduced by Andrei Linde; it&#8217;s amazingly simple.  Could it really be correct?</p>
<p>Among the other very simple ideas that are likely to feature prominently in discussions of the near future are ones involving a &#8220;pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson&#8221;, of a type often called an &#8220;axion&#8221;.  <em>[I wrote a little about this in the paragraph just below the figure within <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/03/26/cosmic-conflation-the-higgs-the-inflaton-and-spin/" target="_blank">this post about the Planck satellite and what it means for variants of inflation.</a>]</em>  One of the variants of inflation that is most consistent with both the Planck satellite and BICEP2  <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>(IF&#8230; IF&#8230;)</strong></span> is an idea called &#8220;natural inflation&#8221;, from 1990, due to Katherine Freese, Joshua Frieman and Angela Olinto.  [Here&#8217;s a <a href="http://ccdb5fs.kek.jp/cgi-bin/img/allpdf?199010350" target="_blank">pdf of the paper</a>.] Such a field has the feature that it is periodic (i.e., if you change it by enough, it comes back to itself, the way an angle that can only range from 0 to 2π.)  It also has the feature that its interactions with all other fields are rather weak.  When this field varies a lot, the dark energy associated with it varies by quite a bit less&#8230; so the field could vary by something approaching the Planck scale yet the energy scale of the dark energy could stay rather constant, at one percent of the Planck energy.</p>
<p>In order for this idea to really be consistent with quantum gravity, it might require some modification, of the sort was introduced in 2008 by Liam McAllister, Eva Silverstein, and Alexander Westphal, in which the axion is periodic with a larger range than you&#8217;d naively expect.  <em>[They did this work in the context of string theory, but I don&#8217;t believe that string theory specifically is necessary for the idea to work; it might work in other consistent quantum gravity theories, if there are any.]  </em>Expect to hear much more about axions.  [By the way, it&#8217;s long been suggested that dark matter itself could be made from a type of axion&#8230; but presumably not the same one&#8230;]</p>

<p>Colleagues: what have I left out?  Eventually this post will be stored on this site as a reference article, so I&#8217;d like to make it complete.</p>
<p><strong>Final Remarks</strong></p>
<p>One more time I must remind you that we&#8217;re still some time away from trusting the BICEP2 result, and quite a long time from trusting the interpretation of the result in terms of inflation.   All of the implications I&#8217;ve mentioned are therefore provisional.   But the list is impressive, and there are probably more I have forgotten to mention, or are known to others but not to me, along with still others that haven&#8217;t yet been noticed by anyone.  So I don&#8217;t yet know if BICEP2&#8217;s measurement is right, or if inflation occurred and if it created the signal they observe, but I do know this: <strong><em>there&#8217;s a lot at stake</em></strong>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The obvious questions and their brief answers, for those wanting to know what&#8217;s going on today. If you already know roughly what&#8217;s going on and want the bottom line, read the answer to the last question.</p>
<p>You may want to start by reading my <a title="History of the Universe" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/" target="_blank">History of the Universe articles</a>, or at least having them available for reference.</p>
<p>The expectation is that today we&#8217;re going to hear from the BICEP2 experiment.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is BICEP2?</li>
</ul>
<p>BICEP2, located at the South Pole, is an experiment that looks out into the sky to study the polarization of the electromagnetic waves that are the echo of the <a title="Hot Big Bang" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/hot-big-bang/" target="_blank">Hot Big Bang</a>; these waves are called the &#8220;cosmic microwave background&#8221;.</p>
<ul>
<li>What are electromagnetic waves?</li>
</ul>
<p>Electromagnetic waves are waves in the electric and magnetic fields that are present everywhere in space.  Visible light is an electromagnetic wave, as are X-rays, radio waves, and microwaves; the only difference between these types of electromagnetic waves is how fast they wiggle and how long the distance is from one wave crest to the next.  <span id="more-7442"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>What is the cosmic microwave background [CMB for short]?</li>
</ul>
<p>The glow leftover from the Hot Big Bang.  The part of the universe we can observe today (the &#8220;observable patch&#8221;; the universe as a whole may be much larger) was once very hot, during the Hot Big Bang.  When it was hotter than about a few thousand degrees, it was opaque to light.  But once it cooled sufficiently for atoms to form, it became transparent, and any light, and any other forms of electromagnetic waves, that was still being emitted at that time was then free to stream across the universe forever.  The &#8220;glow&#8221; from that hot period thus is still present in the universe.  As the observable patch expanded, the wavelength of the electromagnetic waves increased; today most of those waves are in the range of microwaves.</p>
<div style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="thumbimage " style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;" alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Onde_electromagnetique.svg/400px-Onde_electromagnetique.svg.png" width="400" height="99" /><p class="wp-caption-text">In this picture (from Wikipedia commons) a snap-shot of an electromagnetic wave is shown. The wavelength of the wave is marked λ. The wave is moving to the right (in the direction marked &#8220;k&#8221;); the electric field is in blue and points up and down relative to k, and the magnetic field, in red, points in and out of the screen, perpendicular both to k and to the electric field. The polarization direction of this wave is the direction of the electric field: <strong>vertical</strong>.</p></div>
<ul>
<li>What is polarization?</li>
</ul>
<p>An electromagnetic wave has the property that as it heads from point A to point B, the electric field always points in a direction perpendicular to its motion.  (The magnetic field points perpendicular both to the direction of motion and to the electric field.)  The direction along which the electric field points is the &#8220;polarization&#8221; of the electromagnetic wave.</p>
<ul>
<li>What are photons?</li>
</ul>
<p>Electromagnetic waves (including visible light) are made from particles (or &#8220;quanta&#8221;) called &#8220;photons&#8221;.  Each photon is an electromagnetic wave of <em>minimal possible intensity</em>, and each photon&#8217;s polarization can be individually measured.</p>
<ul>
<li> What precisely is BICEP2 doing?</li>
</ul>
<p>BICEP2 looks in each direction of the sky, and detects cosmic microwave photons from that direction.  It then determines whether the polarization of the photons from that direction is entirely random, and thus has an average of zero, or whether it has a (very tiny!) tendency for a preferential orientation.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">If the photons coming from a single small region of the sky have a random polarization direction, then the cosmic microwave background from that region is &#8220;unpolarized&#8221;.  But if they have a slightly preferred direction for their polarization, then the cosmic microwave background from that region of the sky is &#8220;polarized&#8221;, and the amount and orientation of the preference is the &#8220;polarization&#8221; that BICEP2 is measuring.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Why is BICEP2 making this measurement?</li>
</ul>
<p>Both the average energy (&#8220;temperature&#8221;) of the photons coming from a particular direction and their average polarization tell us something about what the observable patch of the universe was like a long time ago: 380,000 years after the Hot Big Bang, which is about when the observable patch became transparent.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why do we care about that?</li>
</ul>
<p>Because what the universe was like 380,000 years after the Hot Big Bang can in turn be used to learn about the very beginning of the Hot Big Bang, and what preceded it &#8212; which may have been a period of <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">cosmic inflation</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>What does the temperature of the photons from the cosmic microwave background [CMB] tell us?</li>
</ul>
<p>The temperature of the CMB photons is, amazingly, almost completely uniform across the sky.  Once the motion of the Milky Way is accounted for, the temperature varies only at one part in 100,000.  The pattern of temperature variation across the sky &#8212; first measured by the COBE satellite, and with increasingly precision since then, most recently by the Planck satellite &#8212; tells us how non-uniform the universe was 380,000 years after the Hot Big Bang began.  From these non-uniformities, working both forward in time through the era of galaxies that we live in, and backward in time through the early Big Bang, scientists have been able to infer many properties of the universe with unprecedented precision, determining how long it has been since the Hot Big Bang, and the make-up of the observable patch (i.e. how much dark energy, dark matter and ordinary matter it contains), to a spectacular degree.  These measurements could have ruled out the possibility of cosmic inflation, but instead they are (so far) quite consistent with that possibility.</p>
<ul>
<li>What does the period at and just before the Hot Big Bang have to do with small non-uniformities in an otherwise uniform temperature 380,000 years later?</li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever non-uniformities were present when the Hot Big Bang started would have persisted and changed in a way that scientists can calculate, leading to non-uniformities of a predictable size at 380,000 years.  In other words, from knowing what the non-uniformities are at 380,000 years, scientists can work backwards, and determine what the non-uniformities were when the Hot Big Bang began.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why would there have been non-uniformities in the temperature of the Hot Big Bang?</li>
</ul>
<p>Why not?  In fact, the first question you should ask is why they&#8217;re so small!</p>
<ul>
<li>Why are they so small?</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, we&#8217;re not sure, but that&#8217;s where the idea of inflation comes in.   By causing the observable patch of the universe and its surrounding regions to blow up almost instantly into a vastly larger size, <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">inflation</a> would have pushed all material and all structure far, far away, making the observable patch incredibly uniform.</p>
<ul>
<li>But then why are there any measurable non-uniformities at all</li>
</ul>
<p>Ah &#8212; because of how quantum mechanics combines with inflation.  (This isn&#8217;t simple, and it deserves an article in future.) Inflation is caused by the presence of a substantial amount of dark energy.  That dark energy is associated with a field (or fields), called the inflaton (or inflatons), about which we currently know almost nothing.  But we do know this:In quantum mechanics, no field or object is ever truly constant or stationary. There is always a sort of quantum jitter which causes it to be a bit uncertain.  The inflaton field&#8217;s value undergoes this quantum jitter.  As a consequence, the dark energy that is present during inflation is not exactly constant throughout space; and that, finally, means that there are small non-uniformities in the expansion of space, which in turn lead to small non-uniformities in the Hot Big Bang, which eventually become visible as non-uniformities in the temperature of the CMB photons.</p>
<ul>
<li>What&#8217;s the point of looking at CMB polarization?</li>
</ul>
<p>The pattern of non-uniformities in the polarization can tell us some things about the universe that are different from what the non-uniformities in the temperature have already taught us.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why is there any polarization at all?  Why aren&#8217;t the CMB photons completely random?</li>
</ul>
<p>Just as the universe is becoming transparent about 380,000 years after the Hot Big Bang, and electrons are all being captured by atomic nuclei as atoms form, the last photons to hit something often scatter off electrons, a process called &#8220;Thomson scattering&#8221;.  Thomson scattering has the property that if a bunch of unpolarized photons come in and hit an electron, but there are more of them coming from above and below than from the left and from the right, then the photons which emerge forward will be somewhat polarized.  In short, <em><strong>Thomson scattering can convert a non-uniformity in the unpolarized photons that are present as the universe becomes transparent to a polarization effect that experiments like BICEP2 can observe</strong></em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Since the non-uniformities in the CMB photons are so small, doesn&#8217;t that mean that polarization effect that BICEP2 has to measure will be extremely tiny?</li>
</ul>
<p>You bet!  BICEP2 is making a very difficult measurement.  An unprecedented one!   But of course, that&#8217;s why they might make a discovery!</p>
<ul>
<li>What will the polarization tell us that the temperature non-uniformities haven&#8217;t already told us?</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, there are two types of polarization in the polarization pattern: &#8220;E-mode&#8221; and &#8220;B-mode&#8221;.  E-mode was measured some time ago, and doesn&#8217;t tell us that much new (though it would have if its features had been surprising; they weren&#8217;t.)  B-mode, however, can tell us a lot.</p>
<ul>
<li>What&#8217;s all this about E-mode and B-mode polarization?</li>
</ul>
<p>The polarization has to be separated into two classes of patterns.  If you look in one direction in the sky, and you look at the polarization of the CMB photons nearby to that direction, you may find that the pattern has a form that would look the same if you reflected it in a mirror.  That type of polarization pattern is called &#8220;E-mode&#8221;.</p>
<p>Or you may find that the pattern is of a form that would flip over in a mirror; that type of polarization pattern is called &#8220;B-mode&#8221;.</p>
<p>Typically you&#8217;ll find a mix of the two; the pattern is almost but not quite unchanged in a mirror.</p>
<p>But (as previous experiments have already shown) the amount of B-mode is much less than the amount of E-mode, making BICEP2&#8217;s measurement of B-mode even more difficult!</p>
<p><img style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;" alt="" src="https://i2.wp.com/inspirehep.net/record/803379/files/EBmode.png" width="NaN" height="265" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Why is B-mode polarization able to tell us something that neither E-mode nor temperature non-uniformities can tell us?</li>
</ul>
<p>E-mode polarization is sensitive to the same type of effects that cause temperature non-uniformities.  But B-mode comes from two sources.</p>
<p>1) In small patches of sky, B-mode polarization arises from a combination of E-mode polarization present 380,000 years ago and the gravitational lensing (i.e., bending of light) of the CMB photons by galaxies that the CMB photons have passed near on their journey to Earth.  B-mode polarization on these smaller scales, which was detected about a year ago, thus tells us something about properties of the observable patch <em>after</em> 380,000 years post-Hot-Big-Bang.</p>
<p>2) But across larger swathes of the sky, B-mode polarization arises in a novel way.  Non-uniformities in the energies of the photons as the universe was becoming transparent also were potentially due to the presence of gravitational waves &#8212; ripples in space itself.  Unlike non-uniformities merely due to there being slightly more dense and less dense regions in the Hot Big Bang, which only give rise to mirror-symmetric (E-mode) polarization after Thomson scattering, gravitational waves can give rise both to mirror-symmetric and mirror-asymmetric polarization&#8230; to both E-mode and B-mode.  Thus, B-mode polarization on large scales tells us about non-uniformities due to gravitational waves that may have been present 380,000 years after the Hot Big Bang &#8212; and <strong><em>a discovery of non-zero B-mode polarization on large scales would be a measurement of powerful gravitational waves present in the early universe!</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Wow! Ripples in space and time!  Gravitational waves predicted by Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity!  Is this the first detection of gravitational waves?</li>
</ul>
<p>No.  This detection is indirect; we actually measure polarization of light and only infer gravitational waves are present. <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1993/press.html" target="_blank">The 1993 Nobel Prize</a> was for the indirect detection of gravitational waves in careful measurements of a system of two neutron stars (the Hulse-Taylor pulsar system).  Efforts toward direct detection of these waves <a href="http://www.ligo.caltech.edu/" target="_blank">are underway</a> and may bear fruit in the near future, but not yet.</p>
<ul>
<li>What&#8217;s so important about these gravitational waves?</li>
</ul>
<p>Their existence is predicted by inflation; just as the inflaton has quantum jitter, so do space and time themselves, and this leads to ripples in space and time.  And so their presence, if in the appropriate pattern, would be more strong evidence in favor of inflation of certain types, and evidence both against certain non-inflationary ideas and against certain variants of inflation that don&#8217;t predict large amounts of gravitational waves.</p>
<p>Moreover, their properties &#8212; in particular, their total power &#8212; would measure, for the first time, the amount of dark energy that was driving inflation, and therefore how rapidly inflation was occurring.  And also, because this dark energy is what eventually heats the universe and starts the Hot Big Bang, it would tell us how hot the universe became after inflation and before it began to cool.</p>
<p>So this is a very big deal!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I haven&#8217;t written in detail about <a title="History of the Universe" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/">the history of the universe</a> before, but with an important announcement coming up today, it was clearly time I do so.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start from the beginning. <a title="Before Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/before-inflation/">How did the universe begin</a>?</p>
<p>You may have heard that &#8220;the Big Bang theory says that the universe began with a giant explosion.&#8221; THIS IS FALSE. <a title="History of the Universe" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/">That&#8217;s not what the original Big Bang Theory said, and it&#8217;s certainly not what the modern form of the Big Bang Theory says</a>. The Big Bang is not like a Big Bomb. It&#8217;s not an explosion. <a title="Big Bang: Expansion, NOT Explosion" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/big-bang-expansion-not-explosion/" target="_blank">It&#8217;s not like a seed exploding or expanding into empty space. It&#8217;s an expansion of space itself</a> &#8212; space that was already large. And in the modern theory of the Big Bang, <a title="History of the Universe" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/" target="_blank">the hot, dense, cooling universe that people think of as the Big Bang wasn&#8217;t even the beginning</a>.</p>
<p>How did the universe begin? <a title="Before Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/before-inflation/" target="_blank">We haven&#8217;t the faintest idea</a>.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right; we don&#8217;t know. And that&#8217;s not surprising; we can trace the history back a long way, an amazingly long way, but at some point, what we know, or even what we can make educated guesses about, drops to zero.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in books, on websites, and on many TV programs, there are many, many, many, many, many descriptions of the universe that say that the Big Bang was the beginning of the universe &#8212; that the universe started with a singularity (one which they incorrectly draw as a point in space, rather than a moment in time) &#8212; and that we know everything (or can guess everything) that happened after the beginning of the universe. Many of them even explicitly say that the Big Bang was an explosion, or they illustrate it that way &#8212; as in, for instance, Stephen Hawking&#8217;s TV special on the universe. <em>[Sigh &#8212; How are scientists supposed to explain these ideas correctly to the public when Stephen Hawking&#8217;s own TV program shows a completely misleading video?!]</em> This is just not true, as any serious expert will tell you.</p>
<p>So what do we actually know? or at least suspect?</p>
<p>Out of the fog of our ignorance comes the strong suspicion &#8212; not yet the certainty &#8212; that at some point in the distant past (<a title="History of the Universe" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/" target="_blank">about 13.7 billion years ago</a>) the part of the universe that we can currently observe (let&#8217;s call it &#8220;the observable patch&#8221; of the universe) was subjected to an extraordinary event, called &#8220;<a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">inflation</a>&#8221;.</p>
<p>We suspect it. We have some considerable evidence. We&#8217;re looking for more evidence. We might learn more about this any day now. Maybe today&#8217;s our day.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for the announcement of a &#8220;Major Discovery&#8221; out of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics later today.  And then stay further tuned for the community&#8217;s interpretation of its reliability.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As many of you know already, we&#8217;re expecting some very significant news Monday, presumably from the <a href="http://bicep.caltech.edu/public/" target="_blank">BICEP2 experiment</a>.  The rumors seem to concern a possible observation of &#8220;B-mode polarization in the cosmic microwave background radiation&#8221;, which, to the person on the street, could mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>strong evidence that <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">inflation</a> occurred in the early universe,</li>
<li>strong evidence against certain alternatives to inflation,</li>
<li>a rough measurement of <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">how much dark energy was present during inflation</a> and</li>
<li>consequently a rough measurement of <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">how hot the universe became when inflation ended</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It would also be cool for at least one other reason: it would be yet another indirect detection of gravitational waves, which are predicted in Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity (but not Newton&#8217;s), just as electromagnetic waves were predicted by Maxwell&#8217;s theory of electricity and magnetism.  Note, however, it would not be the <em>first</em> such indirect detection; that honor belongs to this <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1993/press.html" target="_blank">Nobel-Prize-winning</a> measurement of <a href="http://www.astro.cardiff.ac.uk/research/gravity/tutorial/?page=3thehulsetaylor" target="_blank">the behavior of a pair of neutron stars which orbit each other, one of which is a pulsar</a>.  (Attempts at direct detection are underway at LIGO.)</p>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s possible the rumors aren&#8217;t correct, and that the implications will be completely different from what people currently expect.  But the press release announcing the Monday press conference specifically said &#8220;significant discovery&#8221;, so at least it will be interesting, one way or the other.</p>
<p>If you have no idea, or a limited idea, of what I just said, or if you&#8217;re not sure you have all the issues straight about the universe&#8217;s history and what &#8220;Big Bang&#8221; means, fear not: I have written <a title="History of the Universe" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/">the History of the Universe</a>, designed for the non-expert.  Well, not all of the history, or all of the universe either, but the parts you&#8217;re going to want to know about for Monday&#8217;s announcement.  Those of you who are still awake are invited to read what I&#8217;ve put together and send comments about the parts that are unclear or any aspects that look incorrect.  I&#8217;ll have another post in the morning hours, and then the big announcement takes place just after noon, East Coast time.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#8217;m still early on in my attempts to explain the &#8220;naturalness problem of the Standard Model&#8221; and its implications.  A couple of days ago I explained what particle physicists mean by the term &#8220;natural&#8221; &#8212; it means &#8220;typical&#8221; or &#8220;generic&#8221;. &#8230; <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/08/30/why-you-cant-easily-dismiss-the-cosmological-constant-problem/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m still early on in my attempts to explain the &#8220;naturalness problem of the Standard Model&#8221; and its implications.  <a title="A First Stab at Explaining “Naturalness”" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/08/27/a-first-stab-at-explaining-naturalness/" target="_blank">A couple of days ago</a> I explained what particle physicists mean by the term &#8220;natural&#8221; &#8212; it means &#8220;typical&#8221; or &#8220;generic&#8221;.  And I described how, at least from one naive point of view, the Standard Model (the equations we use to describe <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the known elementary particles and forces</a>) is unnatural.  Indeed any theory is unnatural that has a</p>
<ul>
<li>a spin-zero particle (in the Standard Model, the newly discovered Higgs particle), which</li>
<li>is very lightweight in the following sense: it has a very very low mass-energy compared to the energy at which gravity becomes <a title="The Strengths of the Known Forces" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-forces-of-nature/the-strength-of-the-known-forces/" target="_blank">a strong force</a>, and which</li>
<li>isn&#8217;t accompanied (in the Standard Model specifically) by other related particles that also have small masses.</li>
</ul>
<p>But I didn&#8217;t actually <em>explain</em> any of this yet; I just described it.</p>
<p>Specifically, I didn&#8217;t start yet to explain what <em>causes</em> the Standard Model to be unnatural.  This is important to do, because, as many attentive readers naturally complained, my statements about the unnatural aspect of the Standard Model was based on a rather arbitrary-sounding statistical argument, and story-telling, which is hardly enough for scientific discussion.  Patience; I&#8217;ll get there, not today but probably the next installment after today&#8217;s.</p>
<p>To see why the argument I gave is actually legitimate <em>(which doesn&#8217;t mean it is right, but if it&#8217;s wrong it&#8217;s not for a simple reason you&#8217;ll think of in five minutes),</em> it is necessary to look in a little bit more detail at one of the most fundamental aspects of quantum field theory: quantum fluctuations, and the energy they carry.  So for today I have written <a title="Quantum Fluctuations and Their Energy" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/quantum-fluctuations-and-their-energy/" target="_blank">an article about this</a>, reasonably complete.</p>
<p>Be prepared &#8212; the article runs headlong into the only naturalness problem in particle physics that is worse than the naturalness problem of the Standard Model (the one I wrote about <a title="A First Stab at Explaining “Naturalness”" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/08/27/a-first-stab-at-explaining-naturalness/" target="_blank">on Tuesday</a>)!  I am referring to the &#8220;cosmological constant problem&#8221;.  In a nutshell:</p>
<ul>
<li>we can calculate that, in any typical quantum field theory with gravity, the amount of energy in empty space (often called `dark energy&#8217;) should be huge, and we know of no way to avoid having it in a typical somewhat-realistic theory of the universe,</li>
<li>yet measurements of the cosmos &#8212; in fact, the very existence of a large and old universe &#8212; assure that, if Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity is basically right, then instead of a huge amount of `dark energy&#8217;, there&#8217;s just a very small amount &#8212; not much more than the total amount of mass-energy [E=mc² energy] found in all the matter that&#8217;s scattered thinly throughout the universe.</li>
</ul>
<p>After you&#8217;ve read about quantum fluctuations and the cosmological constant problem, and have a bit of a sense as to why it is so hard to make it go away, we can go back to the Standard Model, and try to understand the naturalness problem that is associated with the Higgs particle and field.  It all has to do with another aspect of quantum fluctuations &#8212; the fact that their energy depends on, and therefore helps determine, the average value of the Higgs field.</p>
