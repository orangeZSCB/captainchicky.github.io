										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maybe you think this shutdown isn&#8217;t all that bad?  Perhaps you&#8217;re not talking to scientists, or thinking about their role in society. The effects of the government shutdown continue to ripple outward.  Scientific research doesn&#8217;t cope well with shutdowns.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/us-government-shutdown-antarctic-research-program-5-other-shuttered-science-programs-1419918">http://www.ibtimes.com/us-government-shutdown-antarctic-research-program-5-other-shuttered-science-programs-1419918</a></p>
<p>In many fields, the research has to be maintained continuously; if you shut it down, even for a short period, all your work is wasted.  <span id="more-6773"></span>For instance, if you&#8217;re working in biology, all your stuff dies.   Back to square one, if you can afford it.  Or if you&#8217;re following an evolving story season by season, missing a season can mean you don&#8217;t have good data and you can&#8217;t draw any conclusions.  Guess you won&#8217;t get that Ph. D. after all; time to go find another line of work, after thanking taxpayers for paying for your now wasted education.  And if something exciting and once-in-a-lifetime happens in the sky, we may not have our telescopes up and running to observe it.  Oh well, what&#8217;s another 150 years?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/08/10-effects-government-shutdown-science_n_4058464.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/08/10-effects-government-shutdown-science_n_4058464.html</a></p>
<p>Does this affect non-scientists?  Of course it does.   If  a serious disease breaks out, where is the Center for Disease Control to notice it and keep track of it?  Who is monitoring our food supply?  Do we really think that unscrupulous food producers, here and abroad, won&#8217;t take advantage of the fact that the Food and Drug Administration isn&#8217;t doing its testing?  What about hackers from hostile nations; are they on shutdown?  If this doesn&#8217;t frighten you, I don&#8217;t know what will&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=50156812n">http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=50156812n</a></p>
<p>And what about the sick who would normally be able to benefit from programs run by the National Institutes of Health?  Imagine you had a sick relative who was not yet &#8220;in imminent danger of dying&#8221;:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/10/health/in-shutdown-clinical-trial-enrollment-slows-but-doesnt-halt.html?_r=0">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/10/health/in-shutdown-clinical-trial-enrollment-slows-but-doesnt-halt.html?_r=0</a></p>
<p>The most hideous part of all of this is that some of our best scientists are actually forbidden, by law, from doing science until this is over.  And meanwhile their chores pile up &#8212; they can&#8217;t work on those either &#8212; which will also get in the way of doing science when they return.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/03/opinion/urry-nasa-shutdown/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/03/opinion/urry-nasa-shutdown/index.html</a></p>
<p>Coming after a recession and a <a title="Not As Painless As They’d Have You Believe" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/05/15/not-as-painless-as-theyd-have-you-believe/" target="_blank">sequester</a> (which were enough to wipe out my own research program), and with no end in sight, one wonders whether the nation will lose an entire generation of young scientists.  You know, young people with little kids and a mortgage <strong>do</strong> have to get paid on time; do they dare work in a government-related institution if they&#8217;re going to be <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/10/09/shutdown-furloughs-return-to-work/2953191/" target="_blank">furloughed</a> every year or two?  And certainly, if you are a young scientist born in another country who is considering whether to take a job offer in the United States compared to remaining in or returning to your own country, you are certainly going to have increasingly serious worries about whether it&#8217;s a good career choice.  We are risking our ability to bring the best young talent from around the world to work in our laboratories and universities.  Not to mention that if you are a foreign scientist, you may not think it so wise to collaborate with American scientists, whose funding might not arrive or who might be forced to stop work.  American scientists may find it increasingly difficult to participate in both small-scale and large-scale international projects.</p>
<p>And this is just a shutdown!  Heaven forbid we should keep threatening to go into something resembling default!  Just when we were starting to get out of the recession, the deficit was coming down, and we had a serious chance to deal with our long-term fiscal challenges, now we&#8217;re going to make things worse again?!</p>
<p>This is a self-imposed and increasingly serious mess.  Our country stands for the rights of all, and those rights should be defended.  But no group, even a large one, and certainly not one with <a href="http://nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/10/09/20886586-kochs-to-congress-focus-on-spending-not-obamacare" target="_blank">a very small, wealthy core</a> <em>(that&#8217;s right, $235 million in donations over just one year &#8212; just think of all the medical and other scientific research that could have funded)</em>, has the right to threaten the rest of us with economic ruin, and risk our hard work and our livelihoods.  Every citizen with an interest in and an understanding of science, business and politics has the responsibility to stand up and be counted.  So please, consider writing and calling your own Congresspeople (<a href="http://www.usa.gov/Contact/Elected.shtml" target="_blank">find them here</a>), and also the people outside your district who are holding us hostage.  And then write and call them tomorrow.  And the next day.  And the next.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, you know there&#8217;s something deeply wrong with the way your country is run when stupid things like this start happening.  Take a research program that&#8217;s been monitoring several thousand people at a time, focusing on their cardiovascular health, and following them for decades (<a href="http://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/about/history.html">http://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/about/history.html</a>); and without warning, <a href="http://www.bu.edu/today/2013/framingham-heart-study-carries-on-despite-budget-cuts/" target="_blank">cut it by over 40%</a>.  Not even a phased cut; just &#8220;sorry, you have $5 million instead of $9 million this year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh, that&#8217;s a good move.  That&#8217;ll save the country a lot of cash.  And so what if all that money we spent already, over the last decade or so, will now be partially wasted (since the data they&#8217;ve been accumulating will be severely compromised.)</p>
<p>It seems likely that the <a href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/" target="_blank">National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</a> (NHLBI), part of the government&#8217;s NIH, would not have imposed this cut this if they themselves didn&#8217;t face severe budget reductions, handed down from the NIH which like all branches of government is suffering cuts.  Do any of my readers know the full story?</p>
<p>When you cut government across-the-board by 6%, the consequences for individual programs tend to be much, much steeper, due to fixed costs that can&#8217;t be cut.  The consequences grow as you go down the bureaucratic chain&#8230;</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope a private foundation will pick up some of the slack on this one.  But this is happening all over, and not every program that we&#8217;ve already spent money on will survive these types of cuts.</p>
<p><em>[Thanks to Matt Buckley for drawing my attention to this story.]</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Big changes are coming to the US academic world.  It&#8217;s a confluence of influences: recession, the climate argument, the online revolution, political gridlock, expensive university education, &#8230;</p>
<p>A major accomplishment by one side has been the elimination <em>(more precisely, the attaching of impractical conditions that made a funding process impossible)</em> of all NSF funding of a social science discipline with few external defenders: political science.  Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2013/08/05/national-science-foundation-cancels-call-for-new-political-science-grant-proposals/" target="_blank">a little article with relevant links</a>, by Sean Carroll.</p>
<p>Of course you can see what will happen next; having succeeded, these folks will go down the list of academic disciplines and eliminate a few more.  What will be the foreseen and unforeseen consequences?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>[NOTE ADDED: Unfortunately, within two months of this post, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/10/fareed-zakaria-plagiarism-new-yorker-time_n_1764954.html" target="_blank"><span style="color:#ff0000;">Mr. Zakaria was suspended from his job for plagiarism.</span></a>  Such a spectacular lack of integrity calls into question everything he has ever written, and so I cannot anymore recommend his article, nor will he ever be quoted on this website again.]</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today <del>I&#8217;d like to call your attention to an article by Fareed Zakaria, entitled &#8220;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/fareed-zakaria-how-government-funding-of-science-rewards-us-taxpayers/2012/06/20/gJQApDmJrV_story.html" target="_blank">How government funding of science rewards U.S. taxpayers.</a>&#8221; </del> (The sentiment also applies to taxpayers elsewhere, of course.) I can&#8217;t vouch for the details inside the article, but the point that Zakaria makes is one that I personally feel is very important.</p>
<p>When I give public talks about the fundamental research that I or my colleagues are doing, I am often asked, &#8220;what are its benefits to society?&#8221;  It&#8217;s a completely fair question, but with fundamental research it is typically far too early to know the answer; it can be many decades before the benefits, if any, become evident.  I think the best answer requires a long view &#8212; the kind of view Zakaria lays out in the article.  I often reply this way: that<strong><em> you should think about government investment in fundamental scientific research as similar to venture capital investments in many small startup companies; most of these efforts will fail, or will succeed with a small payout, but one or two will pay off in spectacular fashion and change the world.</em></strong></p>
<p>And you surely want that payout to happen in a friendly country.  Zakaria  points out the worrying slope that the United States is on; though scientific breakthroughs have a big impact on the economy over the long term, funding for science is on a long-term decline (as a fraction of GDP) in the United States, while it is sharply increasing in a list of countries that include some that are not friendly to the United States.</p>
<p>Zakaria focuses on what is happening today in biotechnology, genetics, genomics, etc.  He also mentions the historical case of the transistor, the device that lies at the heart of our computer-based society. This last is an even nicer example if you expand your view.   The research that was done in the late years of the 19th century on the emission of light by atoms and on the electron led eventually to the equations of quantum mechanics, which in turn were essential in the development of the transistor.  No 19th century scientist could have predicted that the discovery of the electron would help put a cell phone in your pocket.</p>
<p><em>[Thanks are due to Leonid Kruglyak for bringing this article to my attention.]</em></p>
