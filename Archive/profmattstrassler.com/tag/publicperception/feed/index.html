										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A scientific controversy has been brewing concerning the results of <a href="http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/CMB/bicep2/" target="_blank">BICEP2</a>, the experiment that measured polarized microwaves coming from a patch of the sky, and whose measurement has been widely interpreted as <a title="Did BICEP2 Detect Gravitational Waves Directly or Indirectly?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/04/30/did-bicep2-detect-gravitational-waves-directly-or-indirectly/" target="_blank">a discovery of gravitational waves</a>, probably from <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">cosmic inflation</a>. <em>(Here&#8217;s <a title="BICEP2: New Evidence Of Cosmic Inflation!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/bicep2-new-evidence-of-cosmic-inflation/" target="_blank">my post about the discovery</a>, here&#8217;s <a title="A Primer On Today’s Events" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/a-primer-on-todays-events/" target="_blank">some background so you can understand it more easily</a>. Here are <a title="History of the Universe" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/" target="_blank">some of my articles about the early universe</a>.)</em>  On the day of the announcement, some elements of the media hailed it as a great discovery without reminding readers of something very important: <strong>it&#8217;s provisional!</strong></p>
<p>From the very beginning of the BICEP2 story, I&#8217;ve been reminding you (<a title="BICEP2: New Evidence Of Cosmic Inflation!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/bicep2-new-evidence-of-cosmic-inflation/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a title="If It Holds Up, What Might BICEP2′s Discovery Mean?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/18/if-its-holds-up-what-might-bicep2s-discovery-mean/" target="_blank">here</a>) that it is very common for claims of great scientific discoveries to disappear after further scrutiny, and that a declaration of victory by the scientific community comes much more slowly and deliberately than it often does in the press. Every scientist knows that while science, as a collective process viewed over time, very rarely makes mistakes, individual experiments and experimenters are often wrong.  <em>(To its credit, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html" target="_blank">the New York Times article</a> contained some cautionary statements in its prose, and also quoted scientists making cautionary statements.  Other media outlets forgot.)</em></p>
<p>Doing forefront science is extremely difficult, because it requires near-perfection. A single unfortunate mistake in a very complex experiment can create an effect that appears similar to what the experimenters were looking for, but is a fake. Scientists are all well-aware of this; we&#8217;ve all seen examples, some of which took years to diagnose. And so, as with any claim of a big discovery, you should view the BICEP2 result as <em><strong>provisional, until checked thoroughly by outside experts, and until confirmed by other experiments.</strong></em></p>
<p>What could go wrong with BICEP2?  On purely logical grounds, the BICEP2 result, interpreted as evidence for cosmic inflation, could be problematic if <em>any one</em> of the following four things is true:</p>
<p>1) The experiment itself has a technical problem, and the polarized microwaves they observe actually don&#8217;t exist.</p>
<p>2) The polarized microwaves are real, but they aren&#8217;t coming from ancient gravitational waves; they are instead coming from dust (very small grains of material) that is distributed around the galaxy between the stars, and that can radiate polarized microwaves.</p>
<p>3) The polarization really is coming from the cosmic microwave background (the leftover glow from the Big Bang), but it is not coming from gravitational waves; instead it comes from some other unknown source.</p>
<p>4) The polarization is really coming from gravitational waves, but these waves are not due to cosmic inflation but to some other source in the early universe.</p>
<p>The current controversy concerns point 2.<span id="more-7659"></span></p>
<p><strong>Dust in the Sky</strong></p>
<p>One of the challenges for the BICEP2 measurement (and any others like it) is that dust grains in the galaxy, spinning in the presence of magnetic fields, absorbing light, and re-radiating it as somewhat-polarized microwaves, can give a signal that would mimic or obscure a signal of polarized microwaves that are generated by ancient gravitational waves. Consequently, one of the things that the BICEP2 people had to show, to convince first themselves and then others that they were <em>really</em> seeing effects of gravitational waves, was to obtain and present evidence that the effect of polarized dust, in the part of the sky in which they were looking, is too small to affect their measurement. <strong><em>It is this evidence that is now coming into question.</em></strong></p>
<p>If you had a perfect experiment and all the money and time you could want, it would be straightforward to figure out whether you were seeing polarized microwaves from dust or polarized microwaves caused by gravitational waves.  Here&#8217;s how: the amount of polarized light from dust grows rapidly as you look at higher and higher frequency microwaves, peaking at about 400 GHz (GHz = billions [G] of cycles per second [Hz]) while the amount from gravitational waves falls slowly at higher frequencies. So <strong>if</strong> you could measure the polarization at various frequencies, then by looking at whether your polarization signal does or does not increase rapidly with frequency between 100 and 400 GHz, you could distinguish dust-generated polarization easily from gravitational-wave-generated polarization.</p>
<p>But BICEP2&#8217;s high-precision measurements of microwaves have only been made at one frequency (150 GHz &#8212; measurements at 100 GHz will also be available in future).  So to assure their polarization signal wasn&#8217;t from dust, the BICEP2 experimenters had to obtain information from another source. In their paper, they gave an argument that polarized dust was far too small &#8212; at least four and perhaps ten times too small &#8212; to affect their measurement. They did this in two types of ways, indicated in the figure below, which is taken from the BICEP2 paper and annotated by me.</p>

The dashed curves labeled DDM1 and DDM2 are estimates by BICEP2 based on Planck data, some of which has not been published.  The worry is that these estimates might not properly account for Planck&#8217;s data, and that correct estimates might be as large as BICEP2&#8217;s signal, or be so uncertain that no inference concerning BICEP2&#8217;s signal can yet be drawn.</p></div>
<p>One argument relied on various people&#8217;s models of how dust is distributed around the galaxy. These models all show that the amount of dust-generated polarization should be extremely small: most of the lower curves in the figure are from these models, and they lie very close to zero compared to the BICEP2 data.  But this argument is only slightly reassuring, because <em>these models are really highly-educated guesses.  </em> A claim of such an important discovery shouldn&#8217;t rest on that kind of foundation.</p>
<p>So the really strong argument BICEP2 presented was based on reinterpreting some data from the Planck experiment.  This data had only partly been published; some of it had only been made public in graphical form, in plots that were presented during talks at conferences.  It mainly involves polarization from dust, measured by Planck across the sky, mainly at 353 GHz (where dust has the biggest effect).   The BICEP people said to themselves: suppose that the polarization Planck sees comes entirely from dust; well, we know how the polarization effect depends on frequency, so we can infer how much polarization from dust we would find at the BICEP2 frequency. This argument showed that the effect of dust in the region of the sky they were looking at was far too small for them to worry about, even if they viewed it very conservatively; there&#8217;s no way it could explain the signal that they see.  More precisely, of the two estimates I&#8217;ve marked with an arrow, even the worst case scenario, DDM2 (the dashed blue curve), was far below the BICEP2 data.  So there was no way, in the view of the BICEP2 team, that their signal could be coming from dust.</p>
<p>But some experts believe that there&#8217;s something problematic with the way BICEP2 did this, and that when done right, it is possible that the dust polarization will be a far bigger effect than BICEP2 estimated.  <em>[Raphael Flauger is one person with serious concerns: here is <a href="http://www.pctp.princeton.edu/pctp/SpecialEventSimplicity2014/SpecialEventSimplicity2014.html" target="_blank">a talk that he gave this past week</a>, but I&#8217;m afraid that only experts have a hope of understanding it, and I myself have a number of crucial unanswered questions about his presentation.]</em>  I emphasize that <em><strong>I cannot confirm their belief is correct</strong></em>, as I cannot yet construct a completely coherent story from public information &#8212; so I&#8217;m not going to speculate about it. I advise you to emulate the universe, and be patient; the truth will come out eventually, almost certainly within a year.</p>
<p><strong>What Planck Didn&#8217;t Say</strong></p>
<p>Another part of this story is that a couple of weeks ago Planck put out a paper (not published yet, but submitted for publication in a journal) showing their measurements of polarized dust across the sky&#8230; or rather, across <em>much</em> of the sky.  They&#8217;ve done measurements at various frequencies and can, as I described already, figure out how much polarization is coming from dust. You would think this measurement would have settled the issue; either BICEP&#8217;s argument agrees with or doesn&#8217;t agree with what Planck now says. But the whole point here is that BICEP2 makes more precise polarization measurements than Planck does. And in their recent paper, Planck only presents measurements in parts of the sky where they have a strong enough signal that they are confident that they <strong>know</strong> what they&#8217;re seeing, at high precision. Unfortunately, the region where BICEP2 is looking &#8212; a region where the amount of dust is very low, which is exactly why BICEP2 wants to do measurements there &#8212; is a region where Planck can&#8217;t see a strong enough signal to be sure how much polarized dust is present.</p>
<p>So it may well be that currently no one &#8212; not Planck, not BICEP2, not anyone &#8212; really knows for sure how much polarized dust there is in the BICEP2 region of the sky. [Or if the Planck folks already basically know, one can imagine, given how much rides on the answer, that they&#8217;re not telling until they&#8217;re <em>absolutely</em> sure.] Whether the real effect of dust is as small as BICEP2 claimed, or whether it is as big as their signal &#8212; whether their huge discovery of gravitational waves stands, or whether they&#8217;ve merely discovered that dust in the galaxy is far more polarized than expected &#8212; is simply not something that we can know for sure yet.</p>
<p>But all of this confusion probably does add some <strong>uncertainty</strong> &#8212; both the colloquial uncertainty <em>(did BICEP2 really make a big discovery?)</em> and the technical uncertainty <em>(how statistically significant is BICEP2&#8217;s observation?)</em>. It&#8217;s up to BICEP2 to go back through their arguments and determine how much change, if any, they have to make&#8230; and whether, after any appropriate adjustments, their discovery has become notably more tentative than it was before.</p>
<p><strong>Science, Inc.</strong></p>
<p>What you are getting a glimpse of, if you are following this story, is the scientific process in action. In physics &#8212; I can&#8217;t speak for other sciences, and I know there are some where it is not true &#8212; the assumption by the experts is that <em>every claim of a scientific result, especially a major discovery, is <strong>wrong until proven right</strong></em>.  Every result, especially one of particular significance, is poked and prodded, scrutinized and questioned, and subject to a battery of stress tests. Of course the scientists doing the measurement do this first, as best they can, knowing that it&#8217;s better to discover mistakes in private than in public. Then their colleagues do the same, checking the details of the measurement, repeating it (more or less), and trying to do even better measurements of the same effect. Anywhere along the way during this process, an experiment can fail to pass muster. But those that do pass muster &#8212; such as the recent <a title="The Day of the Higgs!!!!  DISCOVERY!!! History Made!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/07/04/the-day-of-the-higgs/" target="_blank">discovery of a Higgs particle</a>, the discovery that <a title="A Nobel Prize That’s No Surprise" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/10/04/a-nobel-prize-thats-no-surprise/" target="_blank">the universe&#8217;s expansion is accelerating</a>, and the <a title="Did BICEP2 Detect Gravitational Waves Directly or Indirectly?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/04/30/did-bicep2-detect-gravitational-waves-directly-or-indirectly/" target="_blank">indirect discovery of gravitational waves back in the 1980s</a> &#8212; will be around for the ages.</p>
<p>BICEP2&#8217;s result, along with its widespread interpretation as evidence of inflation, may yet survive the gauntlet of tests to which it is being subjected. But it&#8217;s far too soon to tell.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did the universe begin with a singularity?  A point in space and/or a moment in time where everything in the universe was crushed together, infinitely hot and infinitely densely packed?</p>
<p><strong><em>Doesn&#8217;t the Big Bang Theory say so?</em></strong></p>
<p>Well, let me ask you a question. Did <strong>you</strong> begin with a singularity?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see. Some decades ago, you were smaller. And then before that, you were even smaller. At some point you could fit inside your mother&#8217;s body, and if we follow time backwards, you were even much smaller than that.</p>
<p>If we follow your growth curve back, it would be very natural &#8212; if we didn&#8217;t know anything about biology, cells, and human reproduction &#8212; to assume that initially you were infinitesimally small&#8230; that you were created from a single point!</p>
<p>But that would be wrong. The mistake is obvious &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t make sense to assume that the period of rapid growth that you went through as a tiny embryo was the simple continuation of a process that extends on and on into the past, back until you were infinitely small.  Instead, there was a point where something changed&#8230; the growth began not from a point but from a single object of definite size: a fertilized egg.</p>
<p>The notion that the Universe <em>started</em> with a Big Bang, and that this Big Bang <em>started</em> from a singularity &#8212; a point in space and/or a moment in time where the universe was infinitely hot and dense &#8212; is not that different, really, from assuming humans begin their lives as infinitely small eggs. It&#8217;s about over-extrapolating into the past.<span id="more-7526"></span></p>
<p>The connection with some kind of singularity dates back to the original Big Bang idea, the one which precedes the notion of <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">cosmic inflation</a> that&#8217;s been in the news over the past few days.  <em>[Here&#8217;s <a title="A Primer On Today’s Events" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/a-primer-on-todays-events/" target="_blank">an FAQ</a> for non-experts about the news; <a title="BICEP2: New Evidence Of Cosmic Inflation!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/bicep2-new-evidence-of-cosmic-inflation/" target="_blank">the news</a> itself; and <a title="If It Holds Up, What Might BICEP2′s Discovery Mean?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/18/if-its-holds-up-what-might-bicep2s-discovery-mean/" target="_blank">what the news might mean if it holds up</a>.]</em>  The part of the universe that we can see with our eyes and telescopes is the &#8220;observable patch&#8221; of the universe; it is probably far smaller than the whole universe <em>(or, if it&#8217;s sufficiently complicated, &#8220;the multiverse&#8221;).</em>  What we know from interpreting various observations of the cosmos is that</p>
<ul>
<li>today the observable patch is cold and diffuse and expanding</li>
<li>once upon a time, billions of years ago, the observable patch was hot and dense</li>
</ul>
<p>To the extent that we trust Einstein&#8217;s equations for gravity, we can use those equations to understand how the Universe might have had this present and that past.  People studying those equations (Friedmann, LeMaître, Robertson and Walker) learned that a universe can go through a process of expanding, cooling and diffusing &#8212; and thus could proceed from <span style="color:#ff9900;"><strong>a hot, dense, rapidly expanding past</strong></span> to <span style="color:#000080;">a <strong><span style="color:#00ccff;"><em>cool, diffuse and slowly expanding present</em></span></strong></span>. This process is what we think our observable patch (and probably a larger region in which it is contained) has been doing for almost all of its 13.7 billion year history.</p>
<p>But suppose, seeing this behavior, we use these equations try to follow time <em>backwards</em> &#8212; just as we tried to infer the past of an embryo. We find our equations suggest a universe in which the further you go back, the hotter it was, the more dense, and the more rapidly it was expanding. If you keep going back and back, then <em>(in the Old Big Bang model, before we knew about inflation)</em> you find that at a sufficiently early time, 13.7 billion years ago, the density, temperature and expansion rate start off as <strong>infinite</strong>. That&#8217;s a <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>singularity!</em></span></p>
<p>But would you have a reason to believe in that singularity?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve talked over the years with many experts in &#8220;quantum gravity&#8221; <em>[the poorly understood but required blend of Einstein&#8217;s gravity and quantum physics, a blend that will be needed to explain extreme gravitational phenomena]</em> and I&#8217;ve never spoken to one who  believed that the universe began with a real singularity. Why? Because</p>
<ul>
<li>the singularity arises from using Einstein&#8217;s equations for gravity</li>
<li>but we know Einstein&#8217;s equations aren&#8217;t <em>sufficient</em> &#8212; they aren&#8217;t able to describe certain extreme gravitational phenomena.</li>
</ul>
<p>Specifically, when the density and heat become extremely large, quantum physics of gravity becomes important. <em>But Einstein&#8217;s equations ignore all these quantum effects.</em> So we already know that <strong><em>in certain extreme conditions, Einstein&#8217;s equations simply don&#8217;t apply</em></strong>. How could we then use those very same equations to conclude there&#8217;s a singularity at the beginning of the universe?</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t.</p>
<p>And if we don&#8217;t know how to alter Einstein&#8217;s gravity equations to make them into quantum gravity equations, then &#8212; well, we don&#8217;t know what happens <em>instead</em> of a singularity.</p>
<p>Now that was where things stood before inflation was known. Inflation changes the details of the <a title="History of the Universe" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/" target="_blank">history of the universe</a> quite a lot. But it doesn&#8217;t change the basic conclusion about singularities: we don&#8217;t and can&#8217;t yet know what happened at the earliest moments of the universe, because we have neither data nor sufficiently clear equations to help us answer basic questions about it.  Related to this, we don&#8217;t know precisely how inflation started (or even <em>could</em> have started) in the first place.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not making this up out of my head.  Just yesterday I was involved in a long conversation with professors and post-doctoral researchers at Harvard, in which we discussed various exotic mathematical methods for exploring the inflationary epoch and the era before it. The possibility that there really is a singularity at the beginning of the universe never came up once.</p>
<p>Or you can look at papers by the world&#8217;s experts &#8212; say, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0702178" target="_blank">one by Alan Guth, a 17-page review</a> of &#8220;eternal&#8221; inflation (i.e. inflation that continues, at least somewhere in our very large universe, into the infinite future) &#8212; and although he devotes some pages to the issue of what might have preceded inflation, the word &#8220;singularity&#8221; does not appear anywhere in his text.</p>
<p>Or look at the figure below, taken from page 6 of <a href="http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/lectures/Biermann_07/LindeLecturesMunich1.pdf" target="_blank">a lecture by Andrei Linde in 2007</a>, giving a schematic depiction of the history of the part of the universe that contains our observable patch.   You see that he shows it as beginning not in a singularity but in &#8220;space-time foam&#8221;. <em>[Compare his picture with the one in my <a title="History of the Universe" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/" target="_blank">History of the Universe</a> article.]</em> What&#8217;s space-time foam? It&#8217;s space-time that is undergoing <a title="Quantum Fluctuations and Their Energy" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/quantum-fluctuations-and-their-energy/" target="_blank">quantum fluctuations</a> &#8212; quantum jitter &#8212; in which space itself is changing its shape from moment to moment!  Well, when someone writes &#8220;space-time foam&#8221; on a graph, to physicists it means almost the same as writing &#8220;somehow quantum gravity takes care of everything&#8221;, without specifics.  (I am confident that Linde will agree that the extreme left of his figure is quite speculative.)</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">Yet all over the media and all over the web, we can find articles, including ones published just after <a title="BICEP2: New Evidence Of Cosmic Inflation!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/bicep2-new-evidence-of-cosmic-inflation/" target="_blank">this week&#8217;s cosmic announcement of new evidence in favor of inflation</a>, that state with great confidence that in the Big Bang Theory the universe started from a singularity. So I&#8217;m honestly very confused. <strong>Who</strong> is still telling the media and the public that the universe really started with a singularity, or that the modern Big Bang Theory says that it does? I&#8217;ve never heard an expert physicist say that. And with good reason: when singularities and other infinities have turned up in our equations in the past, those singularities disappeared when our equations, or our understanding of how to use our equations, improved. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">Moreover, there&#8217;s a point of logic here.  How <em>could</em> we possibly know what happened at the very beginning of the universe? No experiment can yet probe such an early time, and none of the available equations are powerful enough or usable enough to allow us to come to clear and unique conclusions.</span></p>
<p>The modern Big Bang Theory really starts <em>after</em> this period of ignorance, <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">with a burst of inflation that creates a large expanding universe, and the end of inflation which allows for the creation of the heat of the Hot Big Bang</a>.  The equations for the theory, as it currently stands, can be used to make predictions <em>even though</em> we don&#8217;t know the precise nature of our universe&#8217;s birth. Yes, a singularity often turns up in our equations when we extend them as far as they can go in the past; but a singularity of this sort is far from likely to be an aspect of nature, and instead should be interpreted as a sign of what we don&#8217;t yet understand.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week and next, I&#8217;m very busy preparing and delivering a new class <em>(four lectures, 1.5 hours each),</em> for a non-technical audience, on the <a title="Why the Higgs Particle Matters" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/why-the-higgs-particle-matters/" target="_blank">importance of</a> and the <a title="A New Era Dawns" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/07/05/a-new-era-dawns/" target="_blank">discovery of</a> the <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">Higgs particle</a>.  I&#8217;ll be giving it in Western Massachusetts (my old stomping grounds).  If it goes well I may try to give these lectures elsewhere <em>(and please let me know if you know of an institution that might be interested to host them.)</em>   Teaching a new class for a non-technical audience requires a lot of concentration, so I probably won&#8217;t get too much writing in over that period.</p>
<p>Still, as many of you requested, I do hope soon to follow up last week&#8217;s article (on <a title="The Strengths of the Known Forces" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-forces-of-nature/the-strength-of-the-known-forces/" target="_blank">how particle physicists talk about the strength of the different forces</a>) with an article explaining how<em> both particles and forces</em> arise from <em>fields</em> &#8212; a topic I already addressed to some extent <a title="The Energy That Holds Things Together" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/the-energy-that-holds-things-together/" target="_blank">in this article, which you may find useful</a>.</p>
<p>Now &#8212; a few words on the flap over the suggestion that math Ph.D. and finance expert Eric Weinstein, in his mid-40s, may be the new Albert Einstein.  I&#8217;ve kept my mouth shut about this because, simply, how can I comment usefully on something I know absolutely nothing about?  <em>(Admittedly, the modern media, blogosphere and Twitter seem to encourage people to make such comments. Not On This Blog.) </em>There&#8217;s no scientific paper for me to read.  There&#8217;s no technical scientific talk for me to listen to.  I know nothing about this person&#8217;s research.  All I know so far is hearsay.  That&#8217;s all almost anyone knows, except for a few of my colleagues at Oxford &#8212; trustworthy and experienced physicists, who <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23632-how-to-test-weinsteins-provocative-theory-of-everything.html" target="_blank">sound quite skeptical, and certainly asked questions that Weinstein couldn&#8217;t answer.</a>.. which doesn&#8217;t mean Weinstein is necessarily wrong, only that his theory clearly isn&#8217;t finished yet.  <em>(However, I must admit my expert eye is worried that he didn&#8217;t have ready answers to such basic questions.)</em></p>
<p>What I <strong>do</strong> know is that the probability that Weinstein is the new Einstein is very low.  Why?  Because I do know a lot about how <em>very smart people with very good ideas <strong>fail</strong></em> to be Einstein.  It&#8217;s not because they&#8217;re dumb or foolish.<span id="more-6103"></span></p>
<p>First, <strong>most novel and creative theoretical ideas eventually turn out to be mathematically inconsistent.  </strong>Non-experts don&#8217;t hear much about such things because this normally doesn&#8217;t make it into the press or into books, but any expert has invented theories that weren&#8217;t consistent, and thrown them out either before or soon after initial publication.  But let&#8217;s see what we can learn from the case of <em>string theory</em>, the poster child for the very clever idea that made a big splash, still is hanging around, yet still hasn&#8217;t panned out as a theory of nature.</p>
<p>String theory&#8217;s pre-history is a long story, which I&#8217;ll tell another day &#8212; but it was first recognized as a possible theory of all elementary particles and forces, one that could resolve the conflict between quantum mechanics and Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity and include all the known forces and particles, in <a href="http://ccdb5fs.kek.jp/cgi-bin/img/allpdf?196800234" target="_blank">this paper</a>, in 1974.  <em>[About its title: &#8220;Dual Models&#8221; are string theories, and &#8220;non-hadrons&#8221; are elementary particles; let me skip the history behind this.]</em> No one went around writing articles in newspapers that declared Joel Scherk and John Schwarz the new Einsteins, even <strong>after</strong> there was a paper one could read, because the theory wasn&#8217;t complete and it wasn&#8217;t clear it was consistent.  It took until 1984 for Schwarz and Michael Green to prove that <em>although most string theories are inconsistent, <strong>not</strong> <strong>all</strong> of them are inconsistent.</em>  After considerable work, the number of consistent string theories was reduced to a handful, and then, remarkably, in the 90s they were all shown to be related to each other, so in the end there is (in a limited sense) only <em>one</em> consistent theory with strings and quantum gravity in it, called M theory.  It&#8217;s nice to have a unique theory; either it&#8217;s right, or it&#8217;s wrong.  Which leads us to&#8230;</p>
<p>Second, <strong>most mathematically consistent theories turn out not to be consistent with nature.</strong>  In other words, they disagree with <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>experiment</em></span>.  There&#8217;s only one &#8220;real world&#8221; out there; the number of possible universes that one could imagine is potentially much larger.  M theory is a consistent mathematical theory with quantum gravity in it; that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s <strong><em>the</em></strong> theory that describes nature.  Unfortunately M theory is very, very difficult to test experimentally, so that uncertainty may be with us for a long while.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">Here&#8217;s another example, going back a century, of a theory that was mathematically consistent, but turned out experimentally to be wrong: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordstr%C3%B6m's_theory_of_gravitation" target="_blank">Nordstrom&#8217;s theory of gravity</a>, a competitor of Einstein&#8217;s, which was developed over the years that Einstein was developing his own.  (Einstein initially thought Nordstrom&#8217;s theory was not mathematically consistent, but found a way to write it that convinced him it was acceptable.)  Nordstrom was very smart indeed!  He invented a theory of gravity that incorporated Einstein&#8217;s early work on special relativity, which was just what Einstein was trying to do.  But he&#8217;s not famous, because his theory, excellent as it was, just wasn&#8217;t in accord with nature.  In other words, even if Weinstein does has a mathematically consistent theory, it is quite likely to share Nordstrom&#8217;s fate, along perhaps with Scherk and Schwarz&#8217;s great idea.</span></p>
<p>So even if it turns out <em>(once there&#8217;s a paper)</em> that Dr. Weinstein has had a very good idea <em>(and really good ideas are rare)</em>, it is unlikely <em>(given that <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23632-how-to-test-weinsteins-provocative-theory-of-everything.html" target="_blank">he could not answer the basic consistency questions that Dr. Conlon asked him</a>)</em> that we will know whether some version of it is mathematically consistent for quite some time.  And then it is not clear any of us currently living will see a consensus that it describes nature.  We may, by contrast, know very quickly if it is <strong>false</strong>; all that has to happen is that one &#8212; <em>just one</em> &#8212; of its predictions contradicts an existing experiment.</p>
<p><em><strong><span style="color:#800080;">The obstacles that theories that describe nature must overcome should never be underestimated!</span></strong></em></p>
<p>However, let me hasten to add &#8212; Third &#8212; that <strong>a theory does not have to be correct, as a theory of nature, to be useful and important.</strong>  That&#8217;s clearly true of string theory, for many reasons, <a title="From String Theory to the Large Hadron Collider" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/08/15/from-string-theory-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">one of which I wrote about here</a>; it&#8217;s useful as a tool for doing many different types of calculations, in giving insights into otherwise difficult to understand phenomena, and in generating various new ideas about how the world might work.  We can hope that, if Weinstein has had a good idea and if his theory is consistent, or if it can be modified to be consistent, that it will represent a valuable contribution to the field, whether it is true of nature or not.  We can <em>hope</em>; there&#8217;s no way to know or guess without seeing it in detail.</p>
<p>I have no problems with Dr. Weinstein (as yet) &#8212; fresh theoretical ideas, from people who have the training to produce them, are rare and always welcome, and I hope that&#8217;s what he has to offer.  But who does <a href="http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/professor-marcus-du-sautoy" target="_blank">Professor Du Sautoy</a> &#8212; a <em>mathematician</em>, unfortunately appointed to the post of Simonyi Professor for the Public <span style="color:#33cccc;">mis?</span>Understanding of <em>Science</em> &#8212; think he is, irresponsibly and unnecessarily disregarding the established procedures of scientific research <em>(which have worked extraordinarily well for several centuries, as evidenced by the modern scientifically-based technological world that we live in),</em> and declaring someone &#8220;Einstein II&#8221; not only before his theory&#8217;s been tested experimentally, not only before expert physicists have considered his theory carefully to see if it is mathematically consistent, but even before there&#8217;s a finished paper for experts to <em>read</em>?!  No individual has such a right; it is nature&#8217;s, and a community&#8217;s, to decide.  Or are we going back to Aristotle, perhaps even before, where a beautiful idea must be true, perhaps even while it is still half-baked, and empirical facts be damned?  Are we going to start seeing announcements like this every year or two, from the latest smart boy or girl who has delusions of grandeur and a friend who writes for newspapers?  I hope Charles Simonyi understands what&#8217;s just happened&#8230;</p>
<p>It also bothers me that this whole story interacts in unfortunate ways with various myths about Einstein.  Aside from the absurd myth that he was bad at mathematics <em>(he did <strong>not</strong> fail eight-grade math class, and he taught himself calculus)</em>, he is widely said to have been &#8220;outside academia as a patent-clerk&#8221;.  Really, folks, he wasn&#8217;t far. The odd part of the story is that he was an <em>unfunded, unadvised</em> physics graduate student. Like any graduate student in his early-to-mid twenties, he was writing his Ph. D. thesis, reading and writing scientific papers, talking with other physics graduate students; but because he had no advisor and no teaching fellowship, he had to support himself and his family by working in a patent office &#8212; <em>no more a patent clerk than <a href="http://flavorwire.com/220748/strange-day-jobs-of-authors-before-they-were-famous/2" target="_blank">the writer William Faulkner was a postmaster</a></em>.  Why did this happen?  According to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Subtle-Lord-Science-Albert-Einstein/dp/0192806726" target="_blank">Abram Pais&#8217;s biography</a> <em>(written for physicists, so you won&#8217;t want to buy this unless you&#8217;ve got the background to read it)</em>, he&#8217;d had a bad falling out with one of the professors in his undergrad days; this kept him from getting a graduate student teaching fellowship, and almost destroyed his career. Fortunately he was brilliant enough to overcome this setback.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there&#8217;s the myth that he was a fellow with his head in the clouds, thinking deep and beautiful thoughts with no regard for experiment.  But two of his four famous papers in 1905 are not on some ethereal mathematical theory; they involve solving two of the great and concrete experimental puzzles of his day: Brownian motion and the photo-electric effect.  And his two 1905 papers on special relativity aren&#8217;t a complete, over-arching theory that tries to resolve all unsolved issues in physics;  they are short and to the point, mathematically consistent, and brilliant seeds of what he and others developed into a more complete theory later.  Taken together, these papers made Einstein famous among leading physicists within a year or two, though it was still a little while before the relativity ideas were experimentally tested.</p>
<p>Then, as Einstein began to spend much of his time on the problem of gravity &#8212; a period during which he was a <em>professor</em> at famous institutions, in Zurich, Prague and Berlin &#8212; he made many incomplete attempts at a new theory, some of which he published along the way, sometimes with other people.  So when his final version of his gravity theory came out in 1915, he was no unknown patent clerk!  He was deep within academia, and well-known across physics and mathematics.  And experts around him had seen many previous versions of his theory, and were in a position to evaluate it.  Still, even then, in the public he was unknown.  <strong><em>He became famous in the public eye only after his gravity theory was <span style="color:#ff0000;">tested observationally</span>, in 1919. </em></strong> That&#8217;s <em>fourteen years</em> after his first brilliant papers were published.  It was only then was he could be declared the successor to Newton.</p>
<p><em>[Note Added: Even then, as a reader has prompted me to remind you, it was another several decades before the evidence in favor of general relativity was truly convincing! So in 1919 it was  premature to say Einstein&#8217;s gravity theory was clearly right &#8212; though it was not premature to say that he had invented a brilliant, consistent gravity theory of great importance in physics, as well as having proposed plausible and inventive solutions to several other important physics problems.]</em></p>
<p>Compare this with the case of Dr. Weinstein.  I think we have quite a long way to go.</p>
<p>That said, what&#8217;s the rush?  You can&#8217;t get to the bottom of things if you&#8217;re in a big hurry. In our speedy modern world, that can be hard to remember; but for true scientists, it&#8217;s impossible to forget.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the big challenges facing journalists writing about science is to summarize a scientific subject accurately, clearly and succinctly. Sometimes one of the three requirements is sacrificed, and sadly, it is often the first one.</p>
<p>So here is my latest (but surely not last) attempt at an accurate, succinct, and maybe even clear summary of why the Higgs business matters so much.</p>
<p><strong>`True&#8217; Statements about the Higgs</strong></p>
<p>True means &#8220;as true as anything compressed into four sentences can possibly be&#8221; &#8212; i.e., very close to true.  For those who want to know where I&#8217;m cutting important corners, a list of caveats will follow at the end of the article.</p>
<ul>
<li>Our very existence depends upon the Higgs field, which pervades the universe and gives elementary particles, including electrons, their masses.  Without mass, electrons could not form atoms, the building blocks of our bodies and of all ordinary matter.</li>
<li>Last July&#8217;s discovery of the Higgs particle is exciting because it confirms that the Higgs field really exists.  Scientists hope to learn much more about this still-mysterious field through further study of the Higgs particle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Is that so bad? These lines are almost 100% accurate&#8230; I&#8217;m sure an experienced journalist can cut and adjust and amend them to make them sound better and more exciting, but are they really too long and unclear to be useable?</p>
<p><strong>Some False Statements about the Higgs<span id="more-5686"></span></strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile I would like to suggest we avoid the following statements, or anything like them.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Higgs field and/or the Higgs particle were crucial to the Big Bang. <em>[On the contrary, there&#8217;s no evidence that the Big Bang would have been stymied in the absence of the Higgs field and particle, or of anything directly related to them&#8230; despite <a title="Why, Professor Kaku? Why?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/03/19/why-professor-kaku-why/">what Professor Michio Kaku said earlier in the week on CBS news, to the embarrassment and annoyance of the physics community</a>.]</em></li>
<li>All mass in the universe comes from the Higgs field and/or Higgs particle. <em>[<a title="Why the Higgs and Gravity are Unrelated" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/10/15/why-the-higgs-and-gravity-are-unrelated/" target="_blank">There are many things in the universe which don&#8217;t get their mass from the Higgs field</a>, including atomic nuclei, the black holes at the centers of galaxies, and (probably) dark matter.  <em><em></em>Meanwhile, the Higgs particle cannot give mass to <strong>anything</strong>.</em>]</em></li>
<li><em></em>The Higgs field and/or Higgs particle gives ordinary matter its mass.  <em>[Nope; although the Higgs field, by giving the electron its mass, makes ordinary matter possible, it doesn&#8217;t provide most of ordinary matter&#8217;s mass.  Most of an atom&#8217;s mass is in its nucleus, and thus in protons and in neutrons, particles which are not elementary and do <strong>not</strong> get most of their mass from the Higgs field.  Protons and neutrons get the<em>ir masses from effects involving the strong nuclear force; they&#8217;d still have mass if there were no Higgs field.  And again, <strong>nothing </strong>gets its mass from the Higgs particle.</em>]</em></li>
<li>The existence of the Higgs particle confirms Einstein&#8217;s theories. <em>[Einstein had nothing to do with these ideas, which were developed after his death.]</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Oh, and please let&#8217;s stop using &#8220;God Particle&#8221;.  Aside from the fact that it is the <em>field</em>, not the particle, that&#8217;s so important, the term makes it sound as though important religious questions can be answered by science, using experiments. Science is a powerful tool, but it has its limitations, and it cannot address questions of this sort.  No one benefits when scientists and/or the media confuse non-scientists into thinking that it can.</p>
<p><strong>Addenda, Subtleties and Caveats</strong></p>
<p>Now, in the interest of accuracy and precision, and so that any journalists and other non-scientists reading this understand exactly where I&#8217;m taking short cuts, here are some caveats and addenda to the two nearly-accurate statements that I gave above.</p>
<p>A first small caveat: I said the Higgs field &#8220;gives elementary particles&#8221; mass; I avoided saying &#8220;gives all elementary particles their mass&#8221; because it is likely that there are elementary particles that we haven&#8217;t yet discovered that don&#8217;t get their mass from the Higgs field.  This is probably true of the particles of dark matter, assuming that dark matter really is made from particles in the first place.  (In fact it is arguably <a title="Does the Higgs Field Give the Higgs Particle Its Mass, or Not?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/10/23/does-the-higgs-field-give-the-higgs-particle-its-mass-or-not/">true of the Higgs particle itself, but I don&#8217;t want to argue about this,</a> because semantic issues immediately come up.)</p>
<p>The most important subtlety left out of the two statements above is that not only does the Higgs field <strong>exist</strong>, it is &#8220;<strong>on</strong>&#8221;, in a sense. If you could measure the Higgs field at any point in space (which we can&#8217;t actually do directly), you&#8217;d find it isn&#8217;t zero, because it is &#8220;on&#8221;; in fact it has just about the same value everywhere throughout the universe (at least in that part that we can observe.) By contrast, if the Higgs field were &#8220;off&#8221;, you&#8217;d measure it to be zero in most places. This is similar (though different in a couple of key ways) to another field you may know about, the electric field; it too can be &#8220;on&#8221; or &#8220;off&#8221; on average. If it were &#8220;on&#8221; in your vicinity then your hair would stand on end, just as when lightning is about to strike nearby, or when you&#8217;ve just taken off a wool hat in winter and static electricity is at work. On the other hand, the electric field exists (i.e., it is something real that can be measured) even when it is &#8220;off&#8221;, as it probably is where you&#8217;re sitting right now, with nicely behaved hair.</p>
<p>And so an important addendum to the second statement is that discovery of a <a title="From “Higgs-like Particle” to “Standard Model-like Higgs”" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/03/15/from-higgs-like-particle-to-standard-model-like-higgs/" target="_blank">Standard Model-like Higgs particle</a> doesn&#8217;t just confirm the Higgs field exists; it confirms that the field is &#8220;on&#8221; &#8212; which is crucial, since if it were off, it wouldn&#8217;t be able to provide masses for elementary particles.</p>
<p>We must also now add an asterisk to the statement that electrons would be massless if there were no Higgs field.<em> If the Higgs field did not exist at all, the statement is correct</em>: electrons would be massless. However, if the Higgs field existed but were simply <em>turned off</em> somehow, and nothing else were changed, electrons would still have a very, very tiny mass, due to a funny quantum interplay of the strong nuclear force and small interactions between electrons and the (off) Higgs field. <em>(Thanks to George Fleming for reminding me of this some time ago.)</em> But this is really a small asterisk, because it remains true that atoms could not form at the current epoch of the universe; the warmth left over from the Big Bang would blow them apart. The correct statement in this case would be that electrons would have tiny, tiny masses compared to what they do in nature, and this would cause atoms to become extremely fragile and easily fall apart. So the basic idea is still right.</p>
<p>Another addendum: if the Higgs field were off, not just the electron&#8217;s mass but many other aspects of the world would be very, very different. It isn&#8217;t clear exactly what would happen, actually&#8230; it turns out that, for subtle reasons, it is rather hard to calculate the impact. <em>(Professor Chris Quigg recently mentioned to me that he and his colleagues tried to compute the main effects, but found some important issues are too close to call.)</em> It appears likely that there would be no atomic nuclei,  and/or the proton would be unstable, and/or stars couldn&#8217;t shine. What is certain is that the world would be unrecognizable, even if electrons managed through some alternative magic to keep their masses. So the electron&#8217;s mass is only a part of the story &#8212; the part that is easiest to understand, but not the only part &#8212; of why the Higgs field is crucial.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s important because there is yet one more asterisk about the electron and the Higgs. In the so-called Standard Model (the equations that we use to describe <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the known particles and forces</a>) there is only one Higgs field and one Higgs particle, of <a title="The Standard Model Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/" target="_blank">the simplest possible type</a>, and in that case my statements about the electron mass are true (still with the previous asterisk). But if the Standard Model isn&#8217;t quite right, there might be more than one Higgs field and more than one Higgs particle. If this turns out to be the case (and the experimentalists at the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> are trying to find out), then we do not actually know yet that the Higgs field associated to the recently discovered Higgs particle &#8212; the field which definitely gives the W and Z particles much or all of their rather large masses &#8212; is truly the <em>same</em> as the Higgs field that gives the electron its relatively small mass. So the caveat here is that although at least <em>one</em> of the Higgs fields in nature must be responsible for the electron&#8217;s mass, we don&#8217;t yet know that the Higgs particle we&#8217;ve just discovered is associated to <em>that</em> particular field. (The field associated to the newly-discovered Higgs particle would still be crucial to our lives, however, because of its other important roles mentioned in the previous paragraph. Moreover, evidence is already rising that this field interacts with the heaviest cousin of the electron, a particle called the &#8220;tau&#8221;, which for technical reasons makes it more likely that it interacts with the electron too.  Still, strictly speaking the jury is out, and will be for a while.)</p>
<p>Despite these caveats and addenda (and maybe there are more I should add), I still think the above two statements are about as accurate as you can get without becoming technical and long-winded. And again, they are far more accurate than what often appears in print!</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>Colleagues: please feel free to suggest further improvements, and please point out further addenda, subtleties and caveats that I&#8217;ve overlooked; I&#8217;ll add them to this page.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Professor Michio Kaku, of City College (part of the City University of New York), is well-known for his work on string theory in the <del>1960s and</del> 1970s, and best known today for his outreach efforts through his books and his appearances on radio and television.  His most recent appearance was a couple of days ago, in an <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=50142871n" target="_blank"> interview on CBS television</a>, which made its way into <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-205_162-57574534/god-particle-why-the-higgs-boson-matters/" target="_blank">this CBS news article </a>about the importance of the <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">Higgs particle</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Unfortunately, what that CBS news article says about &#8220;why the Higgs particle matters&#8221; is completely wrong.</strong>  Why?  Because it&#8217;s based on what Professor Kaku said about the Higgs particle, and what he said is wrong.  Worse, he presumably knew that it was wrong.  (If he didn&#8217;t, that&#8217;s also pretty bad.) It seems that Professor Kaku feels it necessary, in order to engage the imagination of the public, to make spectacular distortions of the physics behind the Higgs field and the Higgs particle, even to the point of suggesting the Higgs particle triggered the Big Bang.</p>
<p>In doing this, Professor Kaku sows confusion among journalists and the public, and undermines the efforts of serious particle physicists to explain and convey, both vividly and accurately, the science and the excitement of our time.  And on what grounds does he justify this?  Doesn&#8217;t the taxpaying public deserve the truth?  Isn&#8217;t the truth already exciting enough? And what will the public think of science if, in this information era, the promulgation of falsehoods and near-falsehoods on national media is unanswered by complaints from other scientists?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m so frustrated with Professor Kaku&#8217;s unfortunate remarks that rather than write more today, I&#8217;ll simply direct you to Sean Carroll&#8217;s blog &#8212; <a href="http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2013/03/18/what-the-god-particle-hath-wrought/" target="_blank">Sean&#8217;s response was much more measured and polite</a> than mine would be if I spoke my mind.  For now I&#8217;ll just conclude by suggesting that Professor Kaku has some serious explaining to do &#8212; to his scientific colleagues, to the science journalist that he misled, and to the public.</p>
<p><em>(Perhaps you will ask me the same question: &#8220;Why DOES the Higgs particle matter?&#8221;  Here&#8217;s <a title="Why the Higgs Particle Matters" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/why-the-higgs-particle-matters/" target="_blank">my own article from July giving the answer;</a> it&#8217;s short and condensed, but it&#8217;s not false, as my colleagues will attest!  For a longer explanation with more details and fewer shortcuts, you can try <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-205_162-57574534/god-particle-why-the-higgs-boson-matters/" target="_blank">Sean Carroll&#8217;s book</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Higgs-Discovery-Lisa-Randall/dp/1847922570/ref=la_B001H6W2KC_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1363648609&amp;sr=1-3" target="_blank">Lisa Randall&#8217;s book,</a> or  you can poke around on my website for various related articles; there&#8217;s the <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">Higgs FAQ</a>, the story of the <a title="Discovery of the Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-discovery-of-the-higgs/" target="_blank">Higgs discovery</a>, an article on <a title="Why the Higgs and Gravity are Unrelated" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/10/15/why-the-higgs-and-gravity-are-unrelated/" target="_blank">why the Higgs is not related to gravity</a>, or if you&#8217;re really ambitious you can try <a title="How the Higgs Field Works (with math)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/how-the-higgs-field-works-with-math/" target="_blank">this set of articles</a> [which requires you first read <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/fields-and-their-particles-with-math/" target="_blank">this set</a>] which is suitable for people who once took a little first-year college physics.)</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re gearing up for another big-time storm predicted for the northeastern United States &#8212; <a title="Sandy: Amazing.  Science: Amazing." href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/10/31/sandy-science-amazing/" target="_blank">we&#8217;ve had more than we need over recent months</a> &#8212; so before we perhaps lose power (or you do)&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;I want to remind you that <a href="http://preposterousuniverse.com/" target="_blank">Sean Carroll</a> and I were interviewed last night by science writer Alan Boyle.  My impression is that the conversation (which touched on issues involving the <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">Higgs particle</a>, <a title="Dark Matter Around the Corner?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/11/29/dark-matter-around-the-corner/" target="_blank">dark matter</a>, and the nature of science as a process) went well, and I hope that you enjoy it.  Just click on this link <a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/virtually-speaking-science/2013/02/07/sean-carroll-matt-strassler-alan-boyle" target="_blank">http://www.blogtalkradio.com/virtually-speaking-science/2013/02/07/sean-carroll-matt-strassler-alan-boyle</a> , endure the commercial, and you should get the radio broadcast (just about 60 minutes).</p>
<p>As for that big blizzard threatening Boston with over two feet (0.6 meters) of snow, and winds over 60 miles (100 km) per hour, along with some coastal flooding, it is interesting that the European Weather Model, which did the better job on forecasting Hurricane Sandy, appears to be doing better on this one too.  The US-based Global Forecasting System may again have been a bit late to the party.  <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/11/05/another-storm-predicted/" target="_blank">The difference in the scientific approach of the two forecasting models was described in a previous post</a>, after Sandy, thanks to one of my readers; if you missed it then, you may find it worth a read now.</p>
<p>Well, it will be interesting to see how the reality plays out; but given how well the European model forecast Sandy, it would seem prudent not to underestimate this storm.  Be careful out there!</p>
<p><em>[Note Added: Julianne Dalcanton, professor of astronomy at the University of Washington, pointed me to her university colleague <a href="http://cliffmass.blogspot.com/2013/01/fixing-national-weather-services.html" target="_blank">Cliff Mass&#8217;s article about various problems at the US National Weather Forcasting agency</a>.  See also <a href="http://cliffmass.blogspot.com/2012/12/rebuilding-national-weather-service.html" target="_blank">this article</a>.  This is seriously disturbing stuff, if you live in the U.S.]</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday February 6th, at 9 pm Eastern/6 pm Pacific time, Sean Carroll and I will be interviewed by Alan Boyle on &#8220;Virtually Speaking Science&#8221;.   The link where you can listen in (in real time or at your leisure) is <a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/virtually-speaking-science/2013/02/07/sean-carroll-matt-strassler-alan-boyle" target="_blank">http://www.blogtalkradio.com/virtually-speaking-science/2013/02/07/sean-carroll-matt-strassler-alan-boyle </a></p>
<p>What is &#8220;<a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/virtually-speaking-science" target="_blank">Virtually Speaking Science</a>&#8220;?  It is an online radio program that presents, according to its website:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><span style="color:#008000;">Informal conversations hosted by science writers Alan Boyle, Tom Levenson and Jennifer Ouellette, who explore the explore the often-volatile landscape of science, politics and policy, the history and economics of science, science deniers and its relationship to democracy, and the role of women in the sciences. </span></em></li>
</ul>
<p>Sean Carroll is a Caltech physicist, astrophysicist, writer and speaker, one of the founders of the blog <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/" target="_blank">Cosmic Variance</a>, who recently completed an excellent popular book <em>(which I highly recommend)</em> on the <a title="Why the Higgs Particle Matters" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/why-the-higgs-particle-matters/" target="_blank">Higgs particle</a>, entitled &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Particle-End-Universe-Higgs/dp/0525953590" target="_blank">The Particle at the End of the Universe</a>&#8220;.  Our interviewer Alan Boyle is a noted science writer, author of the book &#8220;<a href="http://family.boyle.net/pluto/" target="_blank">The Case for Pluto</a>&#8220;, winner of many awards, and currently NBC News Digital&#8217;s science editor [at the blog  &#8220;<a href="http://cosmiclog.nbcnews.com/" target="_blank">Cosmic Log</a>&#8220;].</p>
<p><em>I was interviewed on Virtually Speaking Science once before, by <a href="http://writing.mit.edu/people/faculty/profiles/Tom-Levenson" target="_blank">Tom Levenson,</a> about the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> (<a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/virtuallyspeaking/2012/02/15/matt-strassler-tom-levenson-virtually-speaking-science-1" target="_blank">here&#8217;s the link</a>).  Also, my public talk &#8220;The Quest for the Higgs Particle&#8221; is posted in their website (<a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/virtually-speaking-science/2012/09/08/prof-matt-strassler-the-quest-for-the-higgs-particle" target="_blank">here&#8217;s the link to the audio and to the slides</a>).</em></p>
