<p>As I&#8217;ve described in <a title="Protons and Neutrons: The Massive Pandemonium of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/protons-and-neutrons/" target="_blank">my new article</a>, along the lines of <a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/" target="_blank">this short article</a> and <a title="Checking What’s Inside a Proton" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/checking-whats-inside-a-proton/" target="_blank">this more detailed one</a> that I wrote some time ago in the context of the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a>, the story that scientists tell the public most often, that &#8220;a proton is made from two up quarks and a down quark&#8221;, is not in fact the full story &#8212; and in some ways it is deeply misleading.  The structure of protons and neutrons is so entirely unfamiliar, and so complicated, that scientists neither have a simple way of calculating it, nor an entirely agreed-upon way to describe it to the public, or even to physics students.  But I believe my way of describing it will be satisfactory to most particle physicists.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday&#8217;s Quiz Question: <strong><span style="color:#800000;">when was the first Higgs particle produced by humans?</span> </strong> (where admittedly &#8220;Higgs&#8221; should have read &#8220;Higgs-like&#8221;) got many answers, but not the one I think is correct. Here&#8217;s what I believe is the answer.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff6600;"><em>[UPDATE: After this post was written, but before it went live, commenter bobathon got the right answer &#8212; at 6:30 Eastern, just under the wire! Well done!]</em></span></p>
<p>The first human-produced Higgs particle <em>[more precisely, the Higgs-like particle with a mass of about 125 GeV/c<sup>2</sup> whose <a title="A New Era Dawns" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/07/05/a-new-era-dawns/">discovery was reported earlier this month</a>, and which I&#8217;ll refer to as &#8220;`H&#8221;&#8211; but I&#8217;ve told you <a title="Higgs Discovery: Is it a Higgs?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-discovery-of-the-higgs/higgs-discovery-is-it-a-higgs/">why I think it is a Higgs of some sort</a>]</em> was almost certainly created in the United States, at the Fermilab National Accelerator Center outside Chicago. Back in 1988 and 1989, Fermilab&#8217;s accelerator called the Tevatron created collisions within the then-new CDF experiment, during the often forgotten but very important &#8220;<strong>Run Zero</strong>&#8221;.  The energy per collision, and the total data collected, were just enough to make it nearly certain that an H particle was created during this run.</p>
<p>Run Zero, though short, was important because it allowed CDF to prove that precision mass measurements were possible at a proton collider.  They made <a href="http://lss.fnal.gov/archive/1989/pub/Pub-89-160-E.pdf" target="_blank">a measurement of the Z particle&#8217;s mass</a> that almost rivaled the one made simultaneously at the SLC electron-positron collider.  This surprised nearly everyone. <em>[Unfortunately I was out of town and missed the scene of disbelief, back in 1989, when CDF dropped this bombshell during a conference at SLAC, the SLC&#8217;s host laboratory.]</em> Nowadays we take it for granted that the best measurement of the W particle&#8217;s mass comes from the Tevatron experiments, and that the Large Hadron Collider [LHC] experiments will measure the H particle&#8217;s mass to better than half a percent &#8212; but up until Run Zero it was widely assumed to be impossible to make measurements of such quality in the messy environment of collisions that involve protons.</p>
<p>Anyway, it is truly astonishing that we have to go back to <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>1988-1989</strong></span> for the first artificially produced Higgs(-like) particle!! I was a first-year graduate student, and had just learned what Higgs particles were; precision measurements of the Z particle were just getting started, and the top quark hadn&#8217;t been found yet. It took 23 years to make enough of these Higgs(-like) particles to convince ourselves that they were there, using the power of the CERN laboratory&#8217;s Large Hadron Collider [LHC]!</p>
<p><em>[Perhaps this remarkable history will help you understand why <a title="A Very Brief Comment About Yesterday’s Post" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/07/17/a-very-brief-comment-about-yesterdays-post/">I keep saying</a> that<strong> although the LHC experiments haven&#8217;t yet found something unexpected in their data, that absolutely doesn&#8217;t mean that nothing unexpected is there</strong>. What&#8217;s new just may be hard to see, waiting to be noticed with more sophisticated methods and/or more data.]<span id="more-4085"></span></em></p>
<p>What were the other options?</p>
<p>Several commenters suggested that maybe the first H particle was made at CERN&#8217;s SpS collider, which was the first proton/anti-proton collider, used to discover the W and Z particles in the early 1980s. The SpS, running at an energy of first 540 GeV and later 640 GeV per collision, was the first that really had enough energy to make a 125 GeV/c<sup>2</sup> particle &#8212; in principle. But a particle carrying 125/640, or about 20%, of a proton/anti-proton collision&#8217;s energy would be very rarely produced. That&#8217;s because most <a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/" target="_blank">quarks and gluons and anti-quarks inside the proton</a> carry small fractions of the energy and momentum of the proton in which they are embedded, so very, very few gluon-gluon collisions inside a 640 GeV proton-proton collision would have energy as large as 125 GeV. On top of that, the vast majority of gluon-gluon collisions won&#8217;t make an H particle even if the gluons&#8217; energy is sufficient. Put these things together and the SpS collider simply didn&#8217;t make nearly enough collisions to create a H particle.<em> (More precisely, there&#8217;s a very small probability that they did, perhaps a few percent.)</em></p>
<p>When the Tevatron began running in the mid-to-late 1980s, it produced proton/anti-proton collisions at 1.8 TeV per collision. This increase in a factor of 3 in the energy per collision compared to SpS leads to an increase of about 50 in the probability of making Higgs particles of mass 125 GeV/c<sup>2</sup>. And in 1988-1989, during Run Zero (which preceded Run Ia, Run Ib and Run II over the ensuing two decades), the Tevatron produced roughly double the number of collisions that the SpS produced during its lifetime. The number of collisions during Run Zero was roughly 300,000,000,000; the probability of making a Higgs particle was a bit more than one per 120,000,000,000. <em>[Technically: the cross-section for Higgs production (including all processes) is about 0.6 per picobarn, and the integrated luminosity of Run 0 was 4.4 picobarn, meaning the average number of Higgs particles produced in such a run would be 2.5 .]</em> Here and throughout I will assume the H is produced at or slightly above the rate for a Higgs of the simplest type (as LHC and Tevatron data currently suggest.) So it is likely that at least one H particle, and probably 2 or 3, were produced during Run Zero; the probability that none were made is below 10%. Congratulations, CDF! you were almost certainly the first&#8230; an honor subject to review if the H turns out to be very different in some way from the simplest type of Higgs (the &#8220;Standard Model Higgs&#8221;)</p>
<p>The following run of the Tevatron &#8212; Run I, from 1992 to 1996 &#8212; increased the number of collisions over Run 0 by a factor of 25 or so, and did so in two experiments, CDF and the new D0. So it is certain that many tens of H particles were produced in the early-to-mid 1990s. <em>[Robert Garisto, Andrew Foland and Phil Gibbs (second try) got as far as suggesting Run I, but all forgot about Run 0.]</em> By the time the LHC started producing 7 TeV collisions in 2009, the Tevatron had produced many thousands of H particles. And yet, because most Higgs(-like) particles decay in a way that is mimicked by other non-Higgs processes, these numbers were not enough for the Tevatron to see a clear H signal above the background and make the discovery.  Just double the number would probably have been enough for the Tevatron to do it.  Instead, the LHC made something like 400,000 H particles within the ATLAS and CMS experiments, mostly in 2011 and so far in 2012, and that was (just barely) enough.</p>
<p>One other place where I believe H particles were produced was the LEP electron-positron collider, but the numbers were very small.  The process electron + positron &#8211;&gt; Higgs is tiny, because electrons and positrons interact so weakly with the Higgs field (that&#8217;s why they&#8217;re very lightweight.)  Furthermore, unless you tune the electron and positron beams to have exactly half the Higgs&#8217; mass-energy, you won&#8217;t make the Higgs often.  So even though LEP&#8217;s electron-positron collisions reached 125 GeV in the mid-90s, the probability of making a Higgs-like particle at or near that energy is minuscule.  Instead, the efficient way to make a Higgs(-like) particle at LEP was in the process electron + positron &#8211;&gt; Z particle + H particle, where the much stronger interaction of Z and H particles makes the rate much larger. The probability for this process to occur is reasonably large as long as there&#8217;s a few GeV more than enough energy to make both a Z and an H; but the mass-energy of the Z is 91 GeV, the mass-energy of the H is 125 GeV, and the maximum energy of the LEP collisions was 209 GeV, obtained in 2000, the last year or so of running the collider.  Painful!  If they&#8217;d been able to go to 220 GeV, they&#8217;d have found it.</p>
<p>Now in quantum mechanics, you can make a <a title="Virtual Particles: What are they?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/virtual-particles-what-are-they/"> virtual Z particle</a> instead of a real one, just with a lower probability, so in principle 209 GeV is enough to make a 125 GeV Higgs and a slightly virtual Z, with a very low rate. So I think (needs double-checking) LEP probably made a few of these particles.  But it was not enough for a discovery. And in any case, these weren&#8217;t the first; by then the Tevatron had made a hundred or so H particles.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s the HERA electron/proton and positron/proton collider, whose main goal was to study the internal structure of the proton.  At such a machine the dominant production of Higgs particles occurs via the process electron + up quark &#8211;&gt; electron + up quark + Higgs  or  neutrino + down quark + Higgs (also known as &#8220;vector boson fusion&#8221;).  But again HERA didn&#8217;t have nearly enough collision energy to make many H particles, and it didn&#8217;t start running until 1992 anyway.  That said, it would be amusing to know how many were made there; there&#8217;s an unpublished conference proceeding by Bernd Kniehl that worked out the rates, but I haven&#8217;t gone through it yet.  I doubt it was more than a handful.</p>
<p>What about the LHC? In 2010, collisions at ATLAS, CMS and LHCb resulted in well over 1000 H particles. The first ones were probably made during the middle of the summer.</p>
<p>Discovery honors belong to Europe&#8217;s CERN, and the LHC experiments ATLAS and CMS, with a (probable) honorable mention to the Tevatron for finding some (as yet unconfirmed) evidence. But the Tevatron experiment CDF at Fermilab was almost certainly the host of the first 125 GeV/c<sup>2</sup> Higgs(-like) particle produced artificially by humans; and CDF and DZero were the only ones to host such particles, except perhaps a small handful, for twenty years. This is perhaps a source of extreme frustration, more than anything else, especially since the Tevatron&#8217;s run over the past decade did not produce as many collisions as originally hoped, and since the Tevatron is now closed, leaving U.S. particle physics with no high-energy frontier machine in operation or in the planning stages.  Yet maybe it is also a source of consolation to know the particles are there, somewhere, in the decades-old data.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes, it&#8217;s true what you&#8217;ve read; the CMS experiment at the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> has found a new particle.  However, this isn&#8217;t one to get excited about.  Or rather, it&#8217;s the particle that&#8217;s excited, not the rest of us.  It&#8217;s a nice result; a neat result; but this particle is a slightly more massive version of a <a title="What’s a Hadron?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-hadron-as-in-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">hadron</a> that we already knew about, a composite object similar to a <a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/" target="_blank">proton</a>, built out of <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">more fundamental particles</a> we discovered over 30 years ago.  So in the grand scheme of things, this is minor news; no big mysteries to resolve here.  Nevertheless, <strong>congratulations to CMS</strong>! Finding such particles always involves reconstructing them from their decay products, and since this one decays in a very complicated way, the result represents a technical tour-de-force!</p>
<p>This is a similar story to one from last December, when <a title="A New Particle at the LHC? Yes, But…" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/12/22/a-new-particle-at-the-lhc-yes-but/" target="_blank">ATLAS announced that it had found, with confidence, a new particle</a>.  I explained to you then that there are particles and there are particles;<span id="more-3476"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>there are <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/">(apparently)-fundamental particles such as top quarks, electrons, Z particles and neutrinos</a> <em>[&#8220;apparently&#8221; because someday we might learn they have a structure, but right now we know they&#8217;re smaller than a billionth of a billionth of a meter.]</em></li>
<li>there are composite particles that are built from smaller and apparently-fundamental particles; atoms are one class of examples; <a title="What’s a Hadron?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-hadron-as-in-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">hadrons</a>, particles built from quarks, antiquarks and gluons, are another. <em>[All hadrons have a size of about a millionth of a billionth of a meter.]</em></li>
</ul>
<p>As I explained carefully in December, <a title="A New Particle at the LHC? Yes, But…" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/12/22/a-new-particle-at-the-lhc-yes-but/" target="_blank">what ATLAS found was a hadron that is an excited state of a sort of &#8220;atom&#8221; made from a bottom quark and a bottom anti-quark.</a>  Since we found the bottom quark in the 1970s, this is very different indeed from finding, say, the Higgs particle, which would be <em>really</em> new.  <em>[That might happen soon, and certainly <a title="Holiday Higgs Hints: Confidence-Inspiring or Not?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/holiday-higgs-hints-confidence-inspiring-or-not/">we have hints that suggest discovery of the Higgs may be imminent</a>, but the <a title="The Quiet Higgs Quake at CMS" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/13/the-quiet-higgs-quake-at-cms/">evidence</a> is still, in my view, <a title="Taking Stock: Where is the Higgs Search Now?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/07/taking-stock-where-is-the-higgs-search-now/" target="_blank">pretty weak</a>.]</em></p>
<p>Now CMS has found, with high confidence (over 5 standard deviations above background), a hadron that is an excited state of something just a bit more complicated than what ATLAS found.  It contains <strong>a single bottom quark</strong>, a strange quark, and an up quark, along with a whole mess of gluons and quark/anti-quark pairs (as is the case for most hadrons).  <em>[Sometimes people still refer to the top and bottom quarks as &#8220;truth&#8221; and &#8220;beauty&#8221; quarks, which is why you&#8217;ll read people calling this a &#8220;beautiful hadron&#8221; or a &#8220;beauty particle&#8221;.  It makes for good puns.]</em></p>

<p>This is to be compared with a proton, which has two up quarks, a down quark, and a whole mess of gluons and quark/anti-quark pairs.  The class of hadrons that have three quarks plus gluons plus quark/anti-quark pairs are called baryons; the proton is the lightest one, with a mass of 0.938 <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/" target="_blank">GeV</a>/c<sup>2</sup>, but there are hundreds and hundreds of them.  This one is called (tentatively, needing verification) the Ξ*<sub>b</sub><sup>0</sup>; it is electrically neutral (like a neutron) and has a mass of about 5.945 GeV/c<sup>2</sup> <em>[with an uncertainty of about 0.003 GeV/c<sup>2</sup>]</em>. The main differences between the newbie and the proton is that</p>
<ul>
<li>the bottom quark is so heavy that it makes up, by itself, most of the mass of this hadron; and it sits dead center and barely moves while all the other quarks and gluons and anti-quarks whiz around it</li>
<li>the new particle has its quarks and gluons moving around with more energy than necessary <em>(this is what it means to be &#8220;excited&#8221; &#8212; it is the same notion as for an <a title="A New Particle at the LHC?

<li>the new particle decays within a trillionth of a trillionth of a second or so, cascading down in several steps to particles that live long enough to be measured in CMS&#8217;s electronic tracking devices.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a follow-up especially aimed at those non-experts who got really excited by my recent posts on the internal structure of<a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/"> the proton</a> (<a title="Proton Collisions Vs. Quark/Gluon/Antiquark Mini-Collisions" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/proton-collisions-vs-quarkgluonantiquark-mini-collisions/">here</a>, <a title="A Few More Facts About Protons" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/02/15/a-few-more-facts-about-protons/">here</a> and <a title="How Do We KNOW a Proton Is So Complicated? (Data!)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/02/17/how-do-we-know-a-proton-is-so-complicated-data/">here</a>), in which I described the proton as being a lot more complicated than just two up quarks and a down quark, emphasizing the presence of many gluons and of many quark/anti-quark pairs in addition to those three quarks that everyone talks about.</p>
<p>Following those posts, I got a lot of very good questions. I&#8217;ve been absorbing them and thinking about how to answer them effectively.  I had taken you as far as I knew how to go without hitting technical barriers. You probably noticed I was very careful to address certain issues and not others &#8212; answering certain questions and avoiding others. And many of you, intelligently, asked the questions I didn&#8217;t answer. So now you get to find out why I didn&#8217;t answer them in the first place.  [You asked!]  <span id="more-2838"></span>You&#8217;ll also note there are no pictures.  In a couple of cases, that&#8217;s due to lack of time.  But mostly, it&#8217;s because we&#8217;re going beyond where pictures can convey the reality.</p>
<p>So fasten your belts, and be prepared for the possibility that you may not entirely like the answers.</p>
<p>In most cases the answer to the questions you&#8217;ve been asking involves coming to grips with something weird about quantum mechanics. Describing reality becomes a lot harder when we are forced to come face-to-face with the fact that our reality is quantum in nature.  Even those of us who <strong>do</strong> know quantum mechanics very well cannot form a clear intuitive picture of it. We can only learn how to <em>calculate</em> what quantum mechanical systems do, and how to get intuition for <em>how</em> quantum mechanical systems will work. But <em>why</em> they work that way?  Sorry.   Our minds just don&#8217;t form a picture of the world that corresponds to how the world really behaves. To quote Richard Feynman: &#8220;I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of the questions you asked don&#8217;t make sense in a quantum world. They have no answers; you are simply not able to ask them, any more than you can ask, say, <em>how much does a the sound of a piano weigh?</em> On top of that, protons are sufficiently complicated that even for some of the questions that we should be able to answer, the answers are either not known or are so complicated that I don&#8217;t have a good answer for you.</p>
<p>Anyway, here are some of the questions you asked, and some of the answers, as best as I can give you.  We&#8217;ll start with two simpler ones before it gets murky.</p>
<p><strong>Why don&#8217;t the quarks or gluons hit each other inside the proton and make a Higgs particle sometimes?</strong></p>
<p>They don&#8217;t have enough energy, relative to one another. You need a collision that has a lot of energy to make a Higgs particle: 125 <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/">GeV</a> or so. The typical energies of the objects inside a proton are a small fraction of a proton&#8217;s mass-energy, about 1 GeV, so when they hit each other the total energy in that collision is far less than the mass-energy of a Higgs particle. Only by accelerating two protons and having them hit each other head on can you arrange that the energy of a collision of a gluon from one proton with a gluon in the other proton has energy far above 1 GeV, and potentially enough to make a Higgs particle. You can&#8217;t do it within one proton.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very roughly the same reason that two cars that hit head on will make a horrible mess of each other, but a single car can&#8217;t just do that to itself.</p>
<p><strong>Given that a proton is a big mess of quarks, anti-quarks and gluons, is a nucleus, made from protons and neutrons, really to be thought of as a simple collection of protons and neutrons? or is it just as big a mess of quarks and antiquarks and gluons as protons are?  </strong></p>
<p>You can think of it as protons and neutrons.  While the quarks and gluons and anti-quarks are tightly bound inside protons and neutrons, and rush furiously about, the atomic nucleus is a much more fragile object, made from protons and neutrons loosely bound together. The protons and neutrons inside a nucleus remain largely distinguishable. This loose binding is why nuclear fission occurs so easily with some nuclei: it just takes a rather low-energy neutron to break a nucleus apart, much like a pile of beach balls stuck together with cheap glue could be broken apart by another beach ball crashing into them.</p>
<p>Another hint that this is the case is that the radius of a nucleus grows roughly as the one-third power of the number <em><strong>A</strong></em> of protons and neutrons that it contains. That is just you would expect if you tried to gather<em> <strong>A </strong></em>beach balls into a somewhat spherical shape without deforming them very much.</p>
<p>That said, it&#8217;s not entirely boring in the nucleus. The process <em>proton + neutron → neutron + proton</em>, in which an up quark moves from a proton to a neutron while a down quark simultaneously moves from a neutron to a proton (or a down antiquark moves from the proton to the neutron, which is basically indistinguishable), happens regularly, and is indeed one of the processes that generates the forces that helps keep a nucleus together.  <em>This process is central in explaining why neutrons are necessary to make a stable nucleus. In fact, it&#8217;s not an accident that roughly equal numbers of neutrons and protons give you something relatively stable.  </em>And these forces that hold the protons and neutrons together have to be <em>moderately</em> strong, since ordinary electric forces (which are rather weak, by comparison with the strong nuclear force) are trying their best to push the protons away from each other and blow the nucleus apart.</p>
<p><em>This last point helps explain why for larger nuclei the number of neutrons is bigger than the number of protons. </em>  <em>Without the proton&#8217;s electric charge the ideal situation would be to have equal numbers of each, but given that the proton does have an electric charge, the energy cost of putting another proton into an already electrically-charged nucleus is high, so on average it turns out to be less costly, if you want to make a bigger nucleus, to put a neutron in instead.</em></p>
<p><strong>How many quark and antiquark pairs are there in a proton?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>You notice that I did not attempt to address this in my articles. That&#8217;s because this number cannot be specified. First, the number is constantly changing [or, in quantum mechanics language, constantly <em>fluctuating &#8212; </em>meaning that if you were to measure it many times, you would get a different answer each time]. And second, even the average number of pairs will depend on exactly what question you ask.</p>
<p><strong>Is the large number of quarks and antiquarks fixed, or does it vary from baryon to baryon?</strong></p>
<p><em>[A baryon is any <a title="What’s a Hadron?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-hadron-as-in-large-hadron-collider/">hadron</a> like a <a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/">proton</a>, in that it contains three quarks, many gluons, and many quark/anti-quark pairs.  But there are many types of baryons.  In general the three extra quarks may be of different types from those found in the proton, and the whole system may have its energy distributed differently than is the case for a proton.]</em></p>
<p>Well, the answer depends on exactly what you meant by your question.</p>
<p>The number of quarks and anti-quarks is always changing &#8212; and also hard to define clearly &#8212; yet however you choose to define it, the average number of quarks and antiquarks of any particular type, and the degree to which that number fluctuates, is the same in every proton. All protons are exactly identical in any measurable intrinsic property.</p>
<p>One baryon which is extremely similar to a proton is a neutron; they&#8217;re almost twins, except for the exchange of an up quark for a down quark.</p>
<p>If by other baryons you want to include, say, the Omega baryon, or the Lambda baryon, or one of the many others, then no, the properties of the quark/anti-quark pairs are not exactly the same as for the proton, though they don&#8217;t differ very much. The basic processes which lead to the existence of those quark and anti-quark pairs are always the same, but the details of what makes the baryon a Sigma or an Omega rather than a proton do affect the details of the quark/anti-quark pairs.</p>
<p><strong>What about the hadrons that have <span style="color:#800000;">equal</span> numbers of quarks and anti-quarks, such as the neutral pion?  How can we tell the difference between a neutral pion and the vacuum of empty space? Or between a pion and another such hadron, say, the eta, which also has equal numbers?</strong></p>
<p>The answer involves quantum mechanics, which is why I sidestepped the issue in my presentation. To keep the discussion simple, let&#8217;s just limit ourselves to up quarks and up anti-quarks and down quarks and down anti-quarks.   Really we should at least include strange quarks too, but that will clutter the discussion without changing the conceptual point.</p>
<p>Our non-quantum mindset would tell us that if we were handed an electrically-neutral quark-antiquark pair, it would have to be either (a) an up quark  <span style="color:#800000;">u</span>  and an up anti-quark  <span style="text-decoration:overline;color:#800000;">u</span>  or  (b) a down quark  <span style="color:#800000;">d</span>  and a down antiquark  <span style="text-decoration:overline;color:#800000;">d</span>. But in our quantum mechanical world, it&#8217;s actually more complicated.</p>
<p>First &#8212; a little weird &#8212; in a quantum world I can have in my hand either <span style="color:#800000;">u<span style="text-decoration:overline;">u</span></span> or <span style="color:#800000;">d<span style="text-decoration:overline;">d</span></span> with certain probabilities, where the probabilities sum up to 100%.  To be specific, I could be holding something that has 50% probability to be an up quark/anti-quark pair and 50% probability to be a down quark/anti-quark pair.</p>
<p>But I am afraid it gets much weirder. There are actually multiple ways to have this 50% probability for  u<span style="text-decoration:overline;">u</span>  and 50% probability for  d<span style="text-decoration:overline;">d</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li>One of them can be written (u <span style="text-decoration:overline;">u</span> <strong>+</strong> d <span style="text-decoration:overline;">d</span>).</li>
<li>Another one (the relevant one here) can be written (u <span style="text-decoration:overline;">u</span> <strong>&#8211;</strong> d <span style="text-decoration:overline;">d</span>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>These are not the same.</strong>  And there is <em>nothing</em> you can do about the fact that the difference between them has no intuitive analogue. It is a property of quantum mechanics that <strong><em>these are two different ways to have 50% probability to have an up quark/anti-quark pair and 50% probability to have a down quark/anti-quark pair.</em></strong></p>
<p>In a neutral pion, almost all of the quark/anti-quark pairs are in a configuration that is best described as (u <span style="text-decoration:overline;">u</span> + d <span style="text-decoration:overline;">d</span>). But crudely, there is one pair in the configuration (u <span style="text-decoration:overline;">u</span> &#8211; d <span style="text-decoration:overline;">d</span>). <strong><em>That is </em></strong><em>(partly)</em><strong><em> what makes this hadron a neutral pion.</em></strong></p>
<p>A positively charged pion isn&#8217;t very different. There, almost all of the quark/anti-quark pairs are in a configuration that is best described as (u <span style="text-decoration:overline;">u</span> + d <span style="text-decoration:overline;">d</span>). But then there is one extra up quark and one extra down antiquark, in the configuration u <span style="text-decoration:overline;">d</span>.</p>
<p>And a negatively charged pion has one quark/anti-quark pair in the configuration <span style="text-decoration:overline;">u</span> d.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;ve cheated you slightly, because some of the quark-antiquark pairs in the proton are strange quarks. If we include them, then roughly speaking the quark-antiquark pairs in the proton are typically of the form (u <span style="text-decoration:overline;">u</span> + d <span style="text-decoration:overline;">d</span> + s <span style="text-decoration:overline;">s</span>). And what makes an eta meson is that one of its quark-antiquark pairs is instead roughly arranged as (- u <span style="text-decoration:overline;">u</span> &#8211; d <span style="text-decoration:overline;">d</span> + 2 s <span style="text-decoration:overline;">s</span>).  <em>[I say &#8220;roughly&#8221; here because the numbers actually get modified slightly, as a result of the fact that the strange quark&#8217;s mass quite a bit larger than that of the up and down quarks. But that&#8217;s a detail.]</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;m still badly oversimplifying. A further problem with characterizing the issue in this way is that all up quarks are identical&#8230; so you can&#8217;t say <em><strong>which</strong></em> of the up quarks is in the special configuration. Accounting for this makes the conversation about the pion even more complicated. <em>There&#8217;s an analogue here: in a Lithium atom, there are three electrons, two in the inner shell and one in the outer shell. But actually you can&#8217;t say, in quantum mechanics, which of the three electrons is which. For instance, there&#8217;s no way for you to grab the one in the outer shell, color it green, and check later whether it is still in the outer shell or whether it has changed places with one of the inner electrons. You can&#8217;t color it, or mark it in any way, to make it different from the other two.  It&#8217;s as impossible as trying to say, when two waves on the ocean pass through and/or bounce off each other, which of the two waves is which.</em></p>
<p>Oh, and I&#8217;m afraid there are hadrons whose quark/anti-quark pairs are <em>all</em> arranged as (u <span style="text-decoration:overline;">u</span> + d <span style="text-decoration:overline;">d</span>). Such hadrons are all very unstable so you don&#8217;t hear much about them, but the lightest of them used to be called the σ, and is now usually called the f<sub>0</sub>. So clearly there&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve left out of the story.</p>
<p>Actually, there&#8217;s a lot that I&#8217;ve left out.  But some of it is in the answer to the next question.</p>
<p><strong>Are the quark/anti-quark pairs inside the proton a part of the proton or part of the vacuum of space, which also has quark/anti-quark pairs?</strong></p>
<p>The answer is that the quark/anti-quark pairs that I referred to in my posts are part of the proton: crudely speaking, if I make a proton move, the quark/anti-quark pairs that are a part of the proton will move with it, while those that are part of the vacuum will not.</p>
<p>The main distinction between the types of quark/anti-quark pairs is, however, quantum mechanical.  A quark/anti-quark pair that appears in the vacuum does not generate a strong gluon field, while those that are part of the proton typically do contribute to the strong gluon fields inside the proton.  Why?</p>
<p>Well,  not all quark/anti-quark pairs that you would naively think are the same actually <em><strong>are</strong></em> the same.  The issue is similar to what came up in the answer to the previous question.  There I pointed out that there are ways to arrange an up or down quark/anti-quark pair that  a non-quantum thinker wouldn&#8217;t imagine were possible.  It turns out there&#8217;s even if you just have an up quark and an up anti-quark, there are different arrangements possible.  Most of these arrangements generate a strong gluon field (also called a &#8220;chromo-electric&#8221; field, in analogy to the electric [i.e. photon] field created by an electron.)   But one of them &#8212; the arrangement you most often find in the vacuum &#8212; doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a little bit (but not precisely) analogous to why two electrons placed next to each other will generate an electric (i.e. photon) field that you can feel far away, but an electron and a positron placed very near each other don&#8217;t do that.  This is because the electric fields from the electron and positron are <strong>equal and opposite</strong>,<strong> and mostly cancel</strong> far away, while those from the two electrons are almost <strong>identical and add together</strong>.  It turns out it is possible to arrange a quark and an anti-quark so that their &#8220;chromo-electric&#8221; (i.e. gluon) fields <strong>either cancel or add together</strong> &#8212; a feature not possible for an electron/positron pair.  The pairs in the proton mostly have fields that add; those in the vacuum have fields that cancel.</p>
<p>Another way to say this is that there is a sense in which most quark/anti-quark pairs in the proton are borderline-&#8220;virtual particles&#8221; (which aren&#8217;t really particles, but are more general disturbances in the quark fields) generated by <em><strong>gluons</strong></em>.   (See Figure 5 of <a title="Virtual Particles: What are they?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/virtual-particles-what-are-they/">my virtual particle article</a>, which shows the same thing for electron/positron pairs and photons.) I&#8217;ll say a bit more about this in the answer to the next question.  Most of the quark-antiquark pairs in the vacuum are just spontaneous disturbances of the quark fields that happen <strong><em>on their own</em></strong>, and for such pairs their chromo-electric fields cancel.</p>
<p><strong>Is there not perhaps some sense in which the proton should be thought of as three quarks, with all the gluons and quark-antiquark pairs being just an artifact, or an effect, of having accelerated the proton to high speed?</strong></p>
<p>Well, although I have argued against this in my posts, and given you strong reasons, I should still tell you that actually there <em>almost</em> is such a sense, and this is part of why the issue of the proton&#8217;s structure has been debated for so long.  I don&#8217;t think this is the right way to think about the problem, but I cannot promise you 100% that I&#8217;m right, and so, in fairness, I should present the dissenting minority view.</p>
<p>First you should read <a title="Virtual Particles: What are they?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/virtual-particles-what-are-they/">what I wrote about virtual particles here</a>. (In particular, they&#8217;re not really particles at all.)</p>
<p>It is often useful in technical calculations to think of the quark/anti-quark pairs <a title="Virtual Particles: What are they?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/virtual-particles-what-are-they/">as virtual particles</a> &#8212; which are not particles at all, but fluctuations in the quark fields &#8212; associated with gluons (<a title="Virtual Particles: What are they?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/virtual-particles-what-are-they/">analogous to  fluctuations in the electron field associated with photons &#8212; see Figures 5 and 6 of this article</a>), and then to think of the gluons as fluctuations in the gluon field created in the vicinity of quarks (<a title="Virtual Particles: What are they?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/virtual-particles-what-are-they/">the way electrons create disturbances in the photon [i.e., electromagnetic] field &#8212; see Figures 3 and 4 of this article</a>.).</p>
<p>One might try to take this <em>technical</em> point to be a <em>physical</em> one, and suggest that all the quark/anti-quark pairs and the gluons arise as virtual particles associated to one of the three quarks intrinsic to the proton.</p>
<p>But as I&#8217;ve emphasized in earlier posts and answers to comments, it isn&#8217;t really meaningful to establish a clear difference between virtual particles (which aren&#8217;t particles) and real particles (which are nicely behaved ripples in a quantum field) when you&#8217;re trying to understand something as complicated as a proton&#8217;s interior.</p>
<p>In any case, it turns out that it is hard to get this line of thinking to work for all of the  gluons, but you might get away with thinking about the quark/anti-quark pairs this way.  I can&#8217;t tell you this is entirely excluded, because theorists cannot calculate the proton&#8217;s interior well enough to be sure such a picture is false.  Nor is there any clarifying measurement you could make to check whether this picture made sense.  So you should view this as an unsettled point, a caveat to <a title="How Do We KNOW a Proton Is So Complicated? (Data!)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/02/17/how-do-we-know-a-proton-is-so-complicated-data/">the article I wrote giving you evidence that the proton&#8217;s interior is complicated</a>.</p>
<p>However, even if the minority view turned out to be (at least in some sense) right, my main point for you still would stand: that you <strong>have</strong> to think about the gluons and quark/anti-quark pairs inside the proton &#8212; whatever their origin &#8212; in order to understand anything about <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC] physics.  At the LHC (or even many earlier experiments) there&#8217;s no point in worrying about whether you can or can&#8217;t someday find some way of thinking about the proton as only three quarks.  Any physics you do at the LHC will involve the gluons and the quark/anti-quark pairs in a big way; nothing of any interest arises merely from those three quarks of lore.</p>
<p><strong>Could you perhaps explain the QCD vacuum?</strong></p>
<p>No.  Not now, not yet at least. It&#8217;s one of the most complicated things in particle physics.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Among the bridges that I hope to build, as I develop this website, is one connecting <strong>what we know</strong> today about nature with <strong>how we know it</strong>. After all, you&#8217;re reading my depiction of nature, based on how I think nature works.  I can try to assure you that my depiction is the mainstream viewpoint at the forefront of the research field &#8212; but you may still wonder if this website is legitimate, or if I might just be full of hot air, or if I might simply be mistaken. Well, my confidence in what I&#8217;m saying doesn&#8217;t come from having trained at some fancy university or my degree or from having been in the business for over 20 years. It comes <strong><em>from the data</em></strong>&#8230; in short, from nature itself.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s important, I think, to link the data to the ideas and concepts, when it&#8217;s possible to do that.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve heard the famous statement that &#8220;a proton is made from two up quarks and a down quark&#8221;.  But in <a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/">this basic article</a>, and <a title="Proton Collisions Vs. Quark/Gluon/Antiquark Mini-Collisions" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/proton-collisions-vs-quarkgluonantiquark-mini-collisions/">this somewhat more advanced one</a>, and <a title="A Few More Facts About Protons" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/02/15/a-few-more-facts-about-protons/">in Wednesday&#8217;s post where I went into some details about what we know about proton structure</a>, I&#8217;ve claimed to you that protons are actually chock full of particles, most of which carry a tiny fraction of the proton&#8217;s energy, and most of which are gluons, with a lot of quarks and antiquarks. <em>[If this sounds unfamiliar, you should read those articles and posts before reading this one, which is a follow-up.]  </em>And I claimed that these complications make a big difference at the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC].</p>
<p>So should you take my word for this? You don&#8217;t have to.  Let me show you evidence.  From LHC data.  <a title="Checking What’s Inside a Proton" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/checking-whats-inside-a-proton/">Here&#8217;s an article defending the main claim&#8217;s of Wednesday&#8217;s post.</a>  It&#8217;s a near-final draft, still needing some proofreading perhaps, and probably some clarification, but I think it is fully readable now.  Enjoy it (and please feel free to give me feedback on its clarity, so I can improve it), or wait for the final version next week, as you see fit.  And have a great weekend!</p>

<p>Since a number of readers were surprised to learn, from <a title="Proton Collisions Vs.

Plotted using a Mathematica package (Trout and Olness, 2000) based on CTEQ5L results; somewhat out of date, but accurate enough for today&#039;s purposes.</p></div>
<p>The two plots in the Figure show exactly the same thing, just with a different vertical scale, so that certain things that are hard to see on one plot are clearer on the other. And what they show is this: if a proton is flying toward you in a Large Hadron Collider [LHC] proton beam, and you strike something inside that proton, how likely are you to have hit an up quark, or down quark, or gluon, or up antiquark, or down antiquark, that carries a fraction <em><strong>x</strong></em> of the proton&#8217;s energy? From these plots we can learn:<span id="more-2653"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>From the fact that the curves all grow very rapidly at small x (clearest in the lower plot), you learn that most particles in the proton carry much less than 10% (that is, x &lt; 0.1) of the proton&#8217;s energy, and you are most likely to hit one of those, with lower energies being much more likely than higher ones. <em>[10% isn&#8217;t small, by the way; in 2012 the LHC beams will have 4 <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/" target="_blank">TeV</a> = 4000 <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/" target="_blank">GeV</a> per proton, so 10% means 400 GeV &#8212; whereas to make a 124 GeV Higgs particle from two gluons you would only need 62 GeV per gluon.]</em></li>
<li>From the fact that (lower plot) the yellow curve is so much higher than the others, you learn that if you do hit something that carries less than 10% of the proton&#8217;s energy, then it is most likely a gluon; and quarks and antiquarks (the other curves) are about equally likely once you get below about 2% of the proton&#8217;s energy.</li>
<li>From the fact that (upper plot) the gluon curve dips below the quark curves at higher x, you learn that if you hit something with much above 20% (that is, x&gt;0.2) of the proton&#8217;s energy &#8212;- which is very, very rare &#8212; it is most likely a quark, and about twice as likely to be an up quark as a down quark. <em>[Here we see a remnant of the idea that &#8220;a proton is two up quarks and a down quark.&#8221;]</em></li>
<li>The curves all fall off very quickly as x increases; you are very unlikely indeed to hit anything with more than 50% of the proton&#8217;s energy.</li>
</ul>
<p>These observations are reflected indirectly in <a title="Proton Collisions Vs. Quark/Gluon/Antiquark Mini-Collisions" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/proton-collisions-vs-quarkgluonantiquark-mini-collisions/">Figure 1 of this article on what you gain in going from 7 TeV to 8 TeV at the LHC</a>. Here are a couple of other things that are not obvious from the plots above:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most of the <strong>energy</strong> of the proton is shared (roughly equally, for no special reason) among the small number of higher-energy quarks and the huge number of lower-energy gluons.</li>
<li>However the <strong>number of particles</strong> is dominated by the lower-energy gluons, with very low-energy quarks and antiquarks coming in next.</li>
</ul>
<p>The number of quarks and antiquarks is huge&#8230; but: <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong><em>The total number of up quarks minus the total number of up antiquarks is 2, and the total number of down quarks minus the total number of down antiquarks is 1.</em></strong></span> And as we saw above, <span style="color:#008000;"><strong><em>these excess quarks carry a significant fraction </em></strong><em>(but not the vast majority)</em><strong><em> of the energy</em></strong></span> of a proton as it is flying toward you. <strong>In these senses only, the proton is substantially made from two up quarks and a down quark.</strong></p>
<p>By the way, all of this information was obtained from a fascinating combination of experiments (mostly scattering of electrons or neutrinos off of protons or off of the atomic nuclei of heavy hydrogen [&#8220;deuterium&#8221;, which contains one proton and one neutron]), assembled together using the detailed equations that describe the electromagnetic, strong nuclear and weak nuclear forces.  It&#8217;s a long story going back to the very late 1960s and early 1970s.  And it works beautifully when used to predict the phenomena observed in proton-proton or proton-antiproton colliders like the Tevatron and LHC.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, a commenter asked me a very good question that I realized I hadn&#8217;t yet addressed on this site.  Answering it gives us a chance to look at real data from the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC], and to see what differences will arise the machine&#8217;s energy is <a href="http://press.web.cern.ch/press/PressReleases/Releases2012/PR01.12E.html" target="_blank">increased from 7 TeV to 8</a>.</p>
<p>The protons that are smashed together at the LHC <a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/" target="_blank">are made from many quarks, gluons and antiquarks</a>. The proton-proton collisions take place at a definite energy: 7 <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/" target="_blank">TeV</a> = 7000 GeV in 2011, <a href="http://press.web.cern.ch/press/PressReleases/Releases2012/PR01.12E.html" target="_blank">8 TeV = 8000 GeV  in 2012.</a>  But what we&#8217;re mainly interested in &#8212; what can really create new physical phenomena for us to observe &#8212; are the collisions of a quark in one proton with an antiquark in the other proton, or the collision of two gluons, etc. These &#8220;mini-collisions&#8221; carry only a fraction &#8212; typically a very small fraction &#8212; of the total proton-proton collision energy. <strong><em>How high a fraction can they carry?  <strong><em>and what are the motivations for increasing the energy from 7 TeV per collision to 8 TeV?</em></strong>  </em></strong><a title="Proton Collisions Vs. Quark/Gluon/Antiquark Mini-Collisions" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/proton-collisions-vs-quarkgluonantiquark-mini-collisions/">Click here for the answer.</a></p>
