										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.infoplease.com/spot/wintersolstice1.html" target="_blank">December solstice has come and gone at 11:11 a.m. London time</a> (6:11 a.m New York time). That&#8217;s <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2012/06/19/measure-the-tilt-of-the-earth-on-the-solstice-this-wednesday/" target="_blank">the moment when the north pole of the Earth points most away from the sun, and the south pole points most toward it</a>. Because it&#8217;s followed by a weekend and then Christmas Eve, it marks <strong>the end of the 2012 blogging season</strong>, barring a major event between now and year&#8217;s end. But although 11:11 London time is the only moment of astronomical significance during this day (clearly <a title="The Grand Si11iness of 11/11/11 11:11:11" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/xotica/the-grand-si11iness-of-111111-111111/" target="_blank">the universe does not care where humans set our international date line and exactly how we set our time zones, so destruction was never going to be at local midnight</a> &#8212; something <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57560368/its-already-dec-21-in-europe-so-wheres-doomsday/" target="_blank">the media doesn&#8217;t seem to get</a>) it obviously wasn&#8217;t the end of the world.</p>
<p>A lot of people do put a lot of stock in prophecy, including prophecies of the end of the world that nobody ever made (such as <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/20/world/doomsday-coming/index.html?hpt=hp_c1" target="_blank">the one not made for today by the Mayans, through their calendar</a>) and others that people made but were wrong (such as <a title="The Grand Si11iness of 11/11/11 11:11:11" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/11/11/the-grand-si11iness-of-111111-111111/" target="_blank">those made by Harold Camping last year</a> and by many throughout history who preceded him.) If anyone were any good at prophecy they&#8217;d be able to use their special knowledge to become billionaires, so maybe we should be watching Bill Gates and Michael Bloomberg and the Koch brothers and people like that. I haven&#8217;t heard any rumors of them building bunkers or spaceships yet. Of course at the end of the year they may get a small tax hike, but that wouldn&#8217;t be the end of the world.</p>
<p>The <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC], meanwhile, has triumphantly reached the end of its first run of <a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/" target="_blank">proton</a>-proton collisions. Goal #1 of the LHC was to allow physicists at the ATLAS and CMS experiments to discover <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">the Higgs particle, or particles, or whatever took their place in nature</a>; and it would appear that, in a smashing success, <a title="The Day of the Higgs!!!!  DISCOVERY!!! History Made!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/07/04/the-day-of-the-higgs/" target="_blank">they have co-discovered one</a>.  But no Higgs particles, or anything like them, will be produced again until 2015. Although the LHC will run for a short while in early 2013, it will do so in a different mode, smashing not protons but the nuclei of lead atoms together, in order to study the properties of extremely hot and dense matter, under conditions the universe hasn&#8217;t seen since the earliest stages of the Big Bang that launched the current era of our universe.  Then it will be closed down for repairs and upgrades.  So until 2015, any additional information we&#8217;re going to learn about the Higgs particle, or any other unknown particle that might have been produced at the LHC, is going to be obtained by analyzing the data that has been collected in 2011 and 2012. The total amount of data is huge; what was collected in 2012 was about 4.5 times as much as in 2011, and it was taken at 8 <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/" target="_blank">TeV</a> of energy per proton-proton collision rather than 7 TeV as in 2011. I can assure you there will be many new things learned from analyzing that data throughout 2013 and 2014.</p>
<p>Of course <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.1178" target="_blank">a lot of people prophesied confidently</a> that we&#8217;d discover <a title="Supersymmetry" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/" target="_blank">supersymmetry</a>, or something else dramatic, very early on at the LHC. Boy, were they wrong! Those of us who were cautioning against such optimistic statements are not sure whether to laugh or cry, because of course it would have been great to have such a discovery early in the LHC program. But there was ample reason to believe (despite what other bloggers sometimes say) that even if supersymmetry exists and is accessible to the LHC experiments, discovering it could take a lot longer than just two years!  For instance, see <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0607160" target="_blank">this paper written in 2006 pointing out that the search strategies being planned for seeking supersymmetry might fail in the presence of a few extra lightweight particles not predicted in the minimal variants of supersymmetry</a>. As far as I can tell at present, this very big loophole has only partly been closed by the LHC studies done up to now. The same loophole applies for other speculative ideas, including certain variants of LHC-accessible <a title="Extra Dimensions" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/extra-dimensions/" target="_blank">extra dimensions</a>. I am hopeful that these loopholes can be closed in 2013 and 2014, with additional analysis on the current data, but until they are, you should be very cautious believing those who claim that reasonable variants of LHC-accessible supersymmetry (meaning &#8220;natural variants of supersymmetry that resolve <a title="The Hierarchy Problem" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/" target="_blank">the hierarchy problem</a>&#8221;) are ruled out by the LHC experiments. It&#8217;s just not true. Not yet. The only classes of theories that have been almost thoroughly ruled out by LHC data are those predict on general grounds that there should be no observable Higgs particle at all (e.g. classic technicolor).</p>
<p>While we&#8217;re on the subject, I&#8217;ve been looking back at how I did on prophecy this year. It&#8217;s been a remarkably good year, probably my best ever &#8212; though admittedly I only made very easy (though not necessarily common) predictions. First, the really easy one:  <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/01/24/reviewing-the-search-for-the-higgs/" target="_blank">I assured you</a>, as did most of my colleagues, that 2012 would be the Year of the Higgs &#8212; at least, the Year of the Simplest Possible Higgs particle, called the &#8220;<a title="The Standard Model Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/" target="_blank">Standard Model Higgs</a>&#8221;. It would be the year when <a title="Reviewing the Search for the Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/01/24/reviewing-the-search-for-the-higgs/" target="_blank">Phase 1 of the Higgs Search</a> would end &#8212; when we&#8217;d either find a Higgs particle of Standard Model type (or something looking vaguely like it), or, if not, we&#8217;d know we&#8217;d have to move to <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/01/24/reviewing-the-search-for-the-higgs/" target="_blank">a more aggressive search in Phase 2</a>, in which we&#8217;d look for more complicated versions of the Higgs particle that would have been much harder to find. We started the year with <a title="Holiday Higgs Hints: Confidence-Inspiring or Not?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/holiday-higgs-hints-confidence-inspiring-or-not/" target="_blank">ambiguous hints of the Higgs particle, too flimsy to be sure of, but certainly tantalizing, at around a mass of 125 GeV/c<sup>2</sup></a>. In July the hints turned into <a title="Discovery of the Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-discovery-of-the-higgs/" target="_blank">a discovery</a> &#8212; somewhat <a title="Higgs Discovery: Skill and A Little Luck" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-discovery-of-the-higgs/higgs-discovery-skill-and-a-little-luck/" target="_blank">faster than expected</a> for a Standard Model Higgs particle, because the rate for this particle to appear in collisions that produce two photons was higher than anticipated. The excess in the photon signal means either <a title="Higgs Discovery: Is it a Simplest Higgs?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-discovery-of-the-higgs/higgs-discovery-is-it-a-simplest-higgs/" target="_blank">the probability for the Higgs particle to decay to photons is larger than predicted for a Higgs of Standard Model type, or both CMS and ATLAS experienced a fortunate statistical fluctuation that made the discovery easier</a>. We still don&#8217;t know which it was; though we&#8217;ll know more by March, this ambiguity may remain with us until 2015.</p>
<p><a title="Why The Hints of Higgs Currently Rest on Uncertain Ground" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/why-the-hints-of-higgs-currently-rest-on-uncertain-ground/" target="_blank">One prophecy I made all the way back at the beginning of this blog</a>, July 2011, was that the earliest search strategy for the Higgs, through its decays to a lepton, anti-lepton, neutrino and anti-neutrino, wouldn&#8217;t end up being crucial in the discovery; it was just too difficult. <em>(In this experimental context, &#8220;lepton&#8221; refers only to &#8220;electron&#8221; or &#8220;muon&#8221;; taus don&#8217;t count, for technical reasons.)</em> In the end, I said, it would be decays of the Higgs to two photons and to two lepton/anti-lepton pairs that would be the critical ones, because they would provide a clean signal that would be uncontroversial. And that prophesy was correct; <a title="Higgs Discovery: The Data" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-discovery-of-the-higgs/higgs-discovery-the-data/" target="_blank">the photon-based and lepton-based searches were the signals that led to discovery</a>.</p>
<p>Now we&#8217;ve reached December, and <a title="Another Higgs Update from CERN" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/12/13/another-higgs-update-from-cern/" target="_blank">the data seems to imply that except possibly for this overabundance of photons, which still tantalizes us, the various measurements of how the Higgs-like particle is produced and decays are starting to agree, to a precision which is still only moderate, with the predictions of the Standard Model for a Higgs of this mass</a>. Fewer and fewer experts are still suggesting that this is not a Higgs particle. But it will be some years yet &#8212; 2018 or later &#8212; before measurements are precise enough to start convincing people that this Higgs particle is really of Standard Model type. Many variants of the Standard Model, with new particles and forces, predict that the difference of the real Higgs from a Standard Model Higgs may be subtle, with deviations at the ten percent level or even less. Meanwhile, other Higgs-like particles, with different masses and different properties, might be hiding in the data, and it may take quite a while to track them down. Many years of data collecting and data analysis lie ahead, in <a title="Reviewing the Search for the Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/01/24/reviewing-the-search-for-the-higgs/" target="_blank">Phase 2 of the Higgs search</a>.</p>
<p>Another prophecy I made at the beginning of the year was that <a title="Exotic Decays of the Higgs: A High Priority for 2012" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/01/27/exotic-decays-of-the-higgs-a-high-priority-for-2012/" target="_blank">Exotic Decays of the Higgs would be a high priority for 2012</a>. You might think this prophesy was wrong, because in fact, so far, there have been very few searches at ATLAS, CMS and LHCb for such decays. But the challenge that required prioritizing these decays wasn&#8217;t <em>data analysis</em>; it was the problem of even <em>collecting the data</em>. The problem is that many exotic decays of the Higgs would lead to events that might not be selected by the all-important <a title="Dumping Data Overboard: The Trigger at an LHC Experiment" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/11/04/dumping-data-overboard-the-trigger-at-an-lhc-experiment/" target="_blank">trigger system that determines which tiny fraction of the LHC&#8217;s collisions to store permanently for analysis</a>! At the beginning of 2012 <a title="Exotic Decays of the Higgs: A High Priority for 2012" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/01/27/exotic-decays-of-the-higgs-a-high-priority-for-2012/" target="_blank">there was a risk that some of these processes would have been dumped by the trigger and irretrievably lost from the 2012 data</a>, making future searches for such decays impossible or greatly degraded. At a hadron collider like the LHC, you have to think ahead! If you don&#8217;t consider carefully the analyses you&#8217;ll want to do a year or two from now, you may not set the trigger properly today. So although the priority for <em>data analysis</em> in 2012 was to find the Higgs particle and measure its bread-and-butter properties, the fact that the Higgs has come out looking more or less Standard Model-like in 2012 means that focusing on exotic possibilities, including exotic decays, will be one of the obvious places to look for something new, and thus a very high priority for data analysis, in 2013 and 2014. <strong><em>And that&#8217;s why, for the trigger &#8212; for the collection of the data &#8212; exotic decays were a very high priority for 2012</em></strong>. Indeed, one significant use of <a title="Data Parking at CMS" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/lhcposts/triggering-advances-in-2012/data-parking-at-cms/" target="_blank">the new strategy of delayed data streaming at ATLAS and of data parking at CMS (two names for the same thing)</a> was to address this priority. <em>[My participation in this effort, working with experimentalists and with several young theorists, was my most rewarding project of 2012.]</em>  As I explained to you, <a title="Lightweight Higgs: A `Sensitive Creature’" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/lightweight-higgs-a-sensitive-creature/" target="_blank">a Higgs particle with a low mass, such as 125 GeV/c<sup>2</sup>, is very sensitive to the presence of new particles and forces</a> that are otherwise very difficult to detect, and it easily could exhibit one or more types of exotic decays.  So there will be a lot of effort put into looking for signs of exotic decays in 2013 and 2014! I&#8217;m very excited about all the work that lies ahead of us.</p>
<p>Now, the prophecy I&#8217;d like to make, but cannot &#8212; because I do not have any special insight into the answer &#8212; is on the question of whether the LHC will make great new discoveries in the future, or whether the LHC has already made its last discovery: a Higgs particle of Standard Model type. Even if the latter is the case, we will need years of data from the LHC in order to distinguish these two possibilities; there&#8217;s no way for us to guess. It&#8217;s clear that Nature&#8217;s holding secrets from us.  We know the Standard Model (the equations we use to describe all <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the known particles and forces</a>) is not a complete theory of nature, because it doesn&#8217;t explain things like dark matter<em> (hey, <a title="Dark Matter: Now You See It, Now You Don’t" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/04/20/dark-matter-now-you-see-it-now-you-dont/">were dark matter particles perhaps discovered</a> in 2012?)</em>, and it doesn&#8217;t tell us why, for example, there are <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">six types of quarks</a>, or why the heaviest quark has a mass that is more than 10,000 times larger than the mass of the lightest quarks, etc. What we don&#8217;t know is whether the answers to those secrets are accessible to the LHC; does it have enough energy per collision, and enough collisions, for the job?  The only way to find out is to run the LHC, and to dig thoroughly through its data for any sign of anything amiss with the predictions of the Standard Model. This is very hard work, and it will take the rest of the decade (but not until the end of the world.)</p>
<p>In the meantime, please do not fret about the quiet in the tunnel outside Geneva, Switzerland. The LHC will be back, bigger and better (well, at least with more energy per collision) in 2015. And while we wait during the two year shutdown, the experimentalists at ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb will be hard at work, producing many new results from the 2011 and 2012 proton collision data! Even <a title="The Tevatron Comes to an End" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/09/30/the-tevatron-comes-to-an-end/" target="_blank">the experiments CDF and DZero from the terminated Tevatron</a> are still writing new papers. In short, fear not: not only isn&#8217;t the December solstice of 2012 the end of the world, it doesn&#8217;t even signal a temporary stop to the news about the Higgs particle!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday&#8217;s Quiz Question: <strong><span style="color:#800000;">when was the first Higgs particle produced by humans?</span> </strong> (where admittedly &#8220;Higgs&#8221; should have read &#8220;Higgs-like&#8221;) got many answers, but not the one I think is correct. Here&#8217;s what I believe is the answer.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff6600;"><em>[UPDATE: After this post was written, but before it went live, commenter bobathon got the right answer &#8212; at 6:30 Eastern, just under the wire! Well done!]</em></span></p>
<p>The first human-produced Higgs particle <em>[more precisely, the Higgs-like particle with a mass of about 125 GeV/c<sup>2</sup> whose <a title="A New Era Dawns" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/07/05/a-new-era-dawns/">discovery was reported earlier this month</a>, and which I&#8217;ll refer to as &#8220;`H&#8221;&#8211; but I&#8217;ve told you <a title="Higgs Discovery: Is it a Higgs?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-discovery-of-the-higgs/higgs-discovery-is-it-a-higgs/">why I think it is a Higgs of some sort</a>]</em> was almost certainly created in the United States, at the Fermilab National Accelerator Center outside Chicago. Back in 1988 and 1989, Fermilab&#8217;s accelerator called the Tevatron created collisions within the then-new CDF experiment, during the often forgotten but very important &#8220;<strong>Run Zero</strong>&#8221;.  The energy per collision, and the total data collected, were just enough to make it nearly certain that an H particle was created during this run.</p>
<p>Run Zero, though short, was important because it allowed CDF to prove that precision mass measurements were possible at a proton collider.  They made <a href="http://lss.fnal.gov/archive/1989/pub/Pub-89-160-E.pdf" target="_blank">a measurement of the Z particle&#8217;s mass</a> that almost rivaled the one made simultaneously at the SLC electron-positron collider.  This surprised nearly everyone. <em>[Unfortunately I was out of town and missed the scene of disbelief, back in 1989, when CDF dropped this bombshell during a conference at SLAC, the SLC&#8217;s host laboratory.]</em> Nowadays we take it for granted that the best measurement of the W particle&#8217;s mass comes from the Tevatron experiments, and that the Large Hadron Collider [LHC] experiments will measure the H particle&#8217;s mass to better than half a percent &#8212; but up until Run Zero it was widely assumed to be impossible to make measurements of such quality in the messy environment of collisions that involve protons.</p>
<p>Anyway, it is truly astonishing that we have to go back to <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>1988-1989</strong></span> for the first artificially produced Higgs(-like) particle!! I was a first-year graduate student, and had just learned what Higgs particles were; precision measurements of the Z particle were just getting started, and the top quark hadn&#8217;t been found yet. It took 23 years to make enough of these Higgs(-like) particles to convince ourselves that they were there, using the power of the CERN laboratory&#8217;s Large Hadron Collider [LHC]!</p>
<p><em>[Perhaps this remarkable history will help you understand why <a title="A Very Brief Comment About Yesterday’s Post" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/07/17/a-very-brief-comment-about-yesterdays-post/">I keep saying</a> that<strong> although the LHC experiments haven&#8217;t yet found something unexpected in their data, that absolutely doesn&#8217;t mean that nothing unexpected is there</strong>. What&#8217;s new just may be hard to see, waiting to be noticed with more sophisticated methods and/or more data.]<span id="more-4085"></span></em></p>
<p>What were the other options?</p>
<p>Several commenters suggested that maybe the first H particle was made at CERN&#8217;s SpS collider, which was the first proton/anti-proton collider, used to discover the W and Z particles in the early 1980s. The SpS, running at an energy of first 540 GeV and later 640 GeV per collision, was the first that really had enough energy to make a 125 GeV/c<sup>2</sup> particle &#8212; in principle. But a particle carrying 125/640, or about 20%, of a proton/anti-proton collision&#8217;s energy would be very rarely produced. That&#8217;s because most <a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/" target="_blank">quarks and gluons and anti-quarks inside the proton</a> carry small fractions of the energy and momentum of the proton in which they are embedded, so very, very few gluon-gluon collisions inside a 640 GeV proton-proton collision would have energy as large as 125 GeV. On top of that, the vast majority of gluon-gluon collisions won&#8217;t make an H particle even if the gluons&#8217; energy is sufficient. Put these things together and the SpS collider simply didn&#8217;t make nearly enough collisions to create a H particle.<em> (More precisely, there&#8217;s a very small probability that they did, perhaps a few percent.)</em></p>
<p>When the Tevatron began running in the mid-to-late 1980s, it produced proton/anti-proton collisions at 1.8 TeV per collision. This increase in a factor of 3 in the energy per collision compared to SpS leads to an increase of about 50 in the probability of making Higgs particles of mass 125 GeV/c<sup>2</sup>. And in 1988-1989, during Run Zero (which preceded Run Ia, Run Ib and Run II over the ensuing two decades), the Tevatron produced roughly double the number of collisions that the SpS produced during its lifetime. The number of collisions during Run Zero was roughly 300,000,000,000; the probability of making a Higgs particle was a bit more than one per 120,000,000,000. <em>[Technically: the cross-section for Higgs production (including all processes) is about 0.6 per picobarn, and the integrated luminosity of Run 0 was 4.4 picobarn, meaning the average number of Higgs particles produced in such a run would be 2.5 .]</em> Here and throughout I will assume the H is produced at or slightly above the rate for a Higgs of the simplest type (as LHC and Tevatron data currently suggest.) So it is likely that at least one H particle, and probably 2 or 3, were produced during Run Zero; the probability that none were made is below 10%. Congratulations, CDF! you were almost certainly the first&#8230; an honor subject to review if the H turns out to be very different in some way from the simplest type of Higgs (the &#8220;Standard Model Higgs&#8221;)</p>
<p>The following run of the Tevatron &#8212; Run I, from 1992 to 1996 &#8212; increased the number of collisions over Run 0 by a factor of 25 or so, and did so in two experiments, CDF and the new D0. So it is certain that many tens of H particles were produced in the early-to-mid 1990s. <em>[Robert Garisto, Andrew Foland and Phil Gibbs (second try) got as far as suggesting Run I, but all forgot about Run 0.]</em> By the time the LHC started producing 7 TeV collisions in 2009, the Tevatron had produced many thousands of H particles. And yet, because most Higgs(-like) particles decay in a way that is mimicked by other non-Higgs processes, these numbers were not enough for the Tevatron to see a clear H signal above the background and make the discovery.  Just double the number would probably have been enough for the Tevatron to do it.  Instead, the LHC made something like 400,000 H particles within the ATLAS and CMS experiments, mostly in 2011 and so far in 2012, and that was (just barely) enough.</p>
<p>One other place where I believe H particles were produced was the LEP electron-positron collider, but the numbers were very small.  The process electron + positron &#8211;&gt; Higgs is tiny, because electrons and positrons interact so weakly with the Higgs field (that&#8217;s why they&#8217;re very lightweight.)  Furthermore, unless you tune the electron and positron beams to have exactly half the Higgs&#8217; mass-energy, you won&#8217;t make the Higgs often.  So even though LEP&#8217;s electron-positron collisions reached 125 GeV in the mid-90s, the probability of making a Higgs-like particle at or near that energy is minuscule.  Instead, the efficient way to make a Higgs(-like) particle at LEP was in the process electron + positron &#8211;&gt; Z particle + H particle, where the much stronger interaction of Z and H particles makes the rate much larger. The probability for this process to occur is reasonably large as long as there&#8217;s a few GeV more than enough energy to make both a Z and an H; but the mass-energy of the Z is 91 GeV, the mass-energy of the H is 125 GeV, and the maximum energy of the LEP collisions was 209 GeV, obtained in 2000, the last year or so of running the collider.  Painful!  If they&#8217;d been able to go to 220 GeV, they&#8217;d have found it.</p>
<p>Now in quantum mechanics, you can make a <a title="Virtual Particles: What are they?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/virtual-particles-what-are-they/"> virtual Z particle</a> instead of a real one, just with a lower probability, so in principle 209 GeV is enough to make a 125 GeV Higgs and a slightly virtual Z, with a very low rate. So I think (needs double-checking) LEP probably made a few of these particles.  But it was not enough for a discovery. And in any case, these weren&#8217;t the first; by then the Tevatron had made a hundred or so H particles.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s the HERA electron/proton and positron/proton collider, whose main goal was to study the internal structure of the proton.  At such a machine the dominant production of Higgs particles occurs via the process electron + up quark &#8211;&gt; electron + up quark + Higgs  or  neutrino + down quark + Higgs (also known as &#8220;vector boson fusion&#8221;).  But again HERA didn&#8217;t have nearly enough collision energy to make many H particles, and it didn&#8217;t start running until 1992 anyway.  That said, it would be amusing to know how many were made there; there&#8217;s an unpublished conference proceeding by Bernd Kniehl that worked out the rates, but I haven&#8217;t gone through it yet.  I doubt it was more than a handful.</p>
<p>What about the LHC? In 2010, collisions at ATLAS, CMS and LHCb resulted in well over 1000 H particles. The first ones were probably made during the middle of the summer.</p>
<p>Discovery honors belong to Europe&#8217;s CERN, and the LHC experiments ATLAS and CMS, with a (probable) honorable mention to the Tevatron for finding some (as yet unconfirmed) evidence. But the Tevatron experiment CDF at Fermilab was almost certainly the host of the first 125 GeV/c<sup>2</sup> Higgs(-like) particle produced artificially by humans; and CDF and DZero were the only ones to host such particles, except perhaps a small handful, for twenty years. This is perhaps a source of extreme frustration, more than anything else, especially since the Tevatron&#8217;s run over the past decade did not produce as many collisions as originally hoped, and since the Tevatron is now closed, leaving U.S. particle physics with no high-energy frontier machine in operation or in the planning stages.  Yet maybe it is also a source of consolation to know the particles are there, somewhere, in the decades-old data.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="Higgs Results from The First Week of the Moriond Conference" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/07/higgs-results-from-the-first-week-of-the-moriond-conference/" target="_blank">Today, we got new information</a> at the <a href="http://indico.in2p3.fr/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=6001" target="_blank">Moriond conference</a> on the search for the <a title="The Higgs FAQ 1.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/360-2/" target="_blank">Higgs particle</a> (in particular, <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2011/12/06/guest-post-matt-strassler-on-hunting-for-the-higgs/" target="_blank">Phase 1 of the search</a>, which involves the search for the <em><strong>simplest possible</strong></em> Higgs particle, called the &#8220;<a title="The Standard Model Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/" target="_blank">Standard Model Higgs</a>&#8221;) from the Tevatron and the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC], the Tevatron&#8217;s successor.  With those results in hand, and having had a little time to mull them over, let me give you a short summary.  If you want more details, read <a title="Higgs Results from The First Week of the Moriond Conference" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/07/higgs-results-from-the-first-week-of-the-moriond-conference/" target="_blank">today&#8217;s earlier post</a> and <a title="Awaiting Higgs News from the Tevatron Experiments" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/06/awaiting-higgs-news-from-the-tevatron-experiments/" target="_blank">yesterday&#8217;s preparatory post</a>.</p>
<p>Before I do that, let me make a remark.  There is a big difference between healthy skepticism and political denialism.  I get the impression that some people who are writing or reading other blogs misinterpret my caution with regard to experimental results as being somehow a political and unreasonable bias against the Higgs particle being present, either at a mass of 125 <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/" target="_blank">GeV</a>/c<sup>2</sup> or at all.  That&#8217;s ridiculous.  All that is going on is that I simply am not convinced yet by the data.  I&#8217;m a careful scientist&#8230; period.  And you&#8217;ll see that I&#8217;m consistent; later in this post I will advise you not to over-react negatively to what ATLAS didn&#8217;t see.</p>
<p><strong>What happened today at the Moriond conference?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>From the <a title="The Tevatron Comes to an End" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/09/30/the-tevatron-comes-to-an-end/" target="_blank">now-closed Tevatron</a>, the CDF and DZero experiments presented their results, separately and combined, mainly focusing on the search for <a title="Awaiting Higgs News from the Tevatron Experiments" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/06/awaiting-higgs-news-from-the-tevatron-experiments/" target="_blank">one Standard Model Higgs process, described in Tuesday&#8217;s post</a>.</li>
<li>From the LHC, CMS had already presented its main results from 2011 data on the Standard Model Higgs search, so there wasn&#8217;t much new from them.  But there are three searches which <a title="Holiday Higgs Hints: Confidence-Inspiring or Not?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/holiday-higgs-hints-confidence-inspiring-or-not/" target="_blank">CMS had presented in December that ATLAS had not</a> (at least not with the full 2011 data).  Today, ATLAS presented results on them all.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did we learn?</strong></p>
<p>The Tevatron experiments see a combined 2.2 standard deviation [2.2 &#8220;sigma&#8221;] excess in their search, consistent with a Standard Model Higgs particle with a mass anywhere in the range of 115 to 135 GeV/c<sup>2</sup>.  This is not inconsistent with <a title="Holiday Higgs Hints: Confidence-Inspiring or Not?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/holiday-higgs-hints-confidence-inspiring-or-not/" target="_blank">the Higgs hints that we saw in December from the LHC experiments</a>.  <em>Here I am being perhaps overly careful in not saying, more positively, &#8220;it is consistent with the Higgs hints&#8230;&#8221; only because this measurement is intrinsically too crude to allow us to narrow in on 124-126 GeV, where ATLAS and CMS see their hints.  In short, the Tevatron measurement could, in the end, turn out to indicate a Higgs at a different mass than the one indicated by the current ATLAS and CMS hints.  Anyway, it&#8217;s a minor and mostly a semantic point.</em></p>
<p>The results from ATLAS were a bit of a shock.  In all three processes on which ATLAS reported, CMS has presented results already, and in each case CMS saw a small excess (1 standard deviation [1&#8243;sigma&#8221;], which is  small indeed.)  But ATLAS reported today that it sees essentially no excess in any of the three, and even a deficit in one of them for low mass.  This has a big effect.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, it allows ATLAS to exclude a Standard Model Higgs all the way up to 122 GeV/c<sup>2</sup> (except for a little window 1 GeV/c<sup>2</sup> wide centered at 118) and down to 129 GeV/c<sup>2</sup>.  <strong><em>The only large window left for the Standard Model Higgs particle is 122-129</em></strong>, more or less centered around the hint at 126 GeV/c<sup>2</sup> that they saw in December.</li>
<li>But second, <strong><em>the significance of the December hint</em></strong>, when combined with the new data that shows no excesses in these three new processes, <strong><em>drops by about a full standard deviation</em></strong>.  That&#8217;s a pretty big drop.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What does it all mean?</strong></p>
<p>I think it basically means, roughly, <em>status quo</em>.  We got some positive information and some negative information today, and none of it is that easy to interpret.  So I think we are roughly where we were before, except that we probably no longer have to worry about any Standard Model Higgs below 122 GeV/c<sup>2</sup>.  Before today we had a decent hint of a Standard Model-like Higgs particle with a mass around 125 GeV/c<sup>2</sup>; we still have it.  Let me explain what I mean.</p>
<p>There are easy (relatively!) searches for the Higgs, and there are hard ones.  The easy searches are the ones where the backgrounds are relatively simple and the signal is a narrow peak on a plot.  There are two:</p>
<ol>
<li>Higgs decaying to  photons</li>
<li>Higgs decaying to two lepton/anti-lepton pairs (often called &#8220;four leptons&#8221; for short)</li>
</ol>
<p>Results on these were presented by both ATLAS and CMS back in December.  The hard searches are the ones where the backgrounds are rather complicated and the signal is quite broad, so that a mistake in estimating a background can either create a fake signal or hide a real one.    There are three (mainly) for a lightweight Higgs:</p>
<ol>
<li>Higgs decaying to a lepton, an anti-lepton, a neutrino and an anti-neutrino</li>
<li>Higgs decaying to a tau lepton/anti-lepton pair</li>
<li>Higgs decaying to a bottom quark/anti-quark pair</li>
</ol>
<p>These are the three that ATLAS reported on today (where they saw no sign of a Higgs signal), and that CMS presented back in December (and saw a small excess in all three.)  <em>[ATLAS presented a result on the first one in December, but only using part of their data; it showed a small excess at the time, but not now.]</em>  The third process is the main one in which CDF and DZero reported an excess today, though the first one also plays a role in interpreting that excess.</p>
<p>In other words, <span style="color:#800080;"><strong><em>everything we learned today had to do with the difficult searches</em></strong></span> &#8212; the ones that are hard to perform, hard to interpret, and hard to check.  And everything we learned was 1 or 2 sigma information; not very compelling even statistically.</p>
<p>For this reason,</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>I would not conclude that the new Tevatron results make the 125 GeV Higgs case much stronger</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>I would not conclude that the new ATLAS results <strong><em>make the 125 GeV Higgs case much weaker</em></strong></em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>For the same reason, when I explained why I was skeptical of the evidence <a title="Holiday Higgs Hints: Confidence-Inspiring or Not?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/holiday-higgs-hints-confidence-inspiring-or-not/" target="_blank">back in December, I told you that in my view the CMS excesses in the difficult searches did not make the case for a 125 GeV Higgs much more compelling</a>.  Since the easy searches at CMS do not show as large excesses as ATLAS&#8217;s do, I wasn&#8217;t really comfortable with the whole case from CMS.   <a title="This Week’s Step Forward in the Search for the Higgs Particle" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/02/09/this-weeks-step-forward-in-the-search-for-the-higgs-particle/" target="_blank">Their case improved in January, when they added a bit more information from their easy search for two photons.</a></p>
<p>If, like me, you discount the difficult Higgs searches somewhat relative to the easy Higgs ones, then almost nothing has changed, as far as the current Higgs hints, after today&#8217;s up and down information.  The excess in the two easy searches at ATLAS is still there, and there are excesses at CMS at least in the two-photon search.  Even <a title="Holiday Higgs Hints: Confidence-Inspiring or Not?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/holiday-higgs-hints-confidence-inspiring-or-not/" target="_blank">from the beginning, I gave you good reasons</a> to think the ATLAS&#8217;s easy-search excesses were a bit larger than they should be, probably due to an upward statistical fluctuation in the background.    Conversely I think now that one should not overstate how bad today&#8217;s ATLAS news is for the Higgs hints.  It&#8217;s still quite reasonable to think there may be a Standard Model Higgs there at 125 GeV/c<sup>2</sup>.  There&#8217;s some evidence in its favor, and it&#8217;s certainly not ruled out at this point. (Whereas now, almost all other masses are.)</p>
<p>So as usual I advise patience and calm and no hyperventilating; the 2012 data will settle the issue.  Either there is a Standard Model Higgs with a mass within a few percent of 125 GeV/c<sup>2</sup> , or we&#8217;ll soon be fanning out in <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2011/12/06/guest-post-matt-strassler-on-hunting-for-the-higgs/" target="_blank">Phase 2 of the Higgs search</a>, looking for all the other types of Higgs particles that might be out there.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>[UPDATE: Tevatron results start a few paragraphs down; LHC results <del>will appear soon</del>]</em></p>
<p><em>[2nd UPDATE: ATLAS  new results added: <strong>the big unexpected news</strong>.   As far as I can tell CMS, which got its results out much earlier in the year, didn&#8217;t add anything very new in its talk today.]</em></p>

<p>This morning there <del>are</del> were several talks about the Higgs at <a href="http://indico.in2p3.fr/conferenceOtherViews.py?confId=6001&amp;view=nicecompact&amp;showDate=all&amp;showSession=all&amp;detailLevel=contribution" target="_blank">the Moriond Electroweak conference</a>.  There <del>will be</del> were talks coming from the Tevatron experiments CDF and DZero; we expected new results on the search for the <a title="The Higgs FAQ 1.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/360-2/" target="_blank">Higgs particle</a> from each experiment separately, and combined together.  There were also talks from the Large Hadron Collider [LHC] experiments CMS and ATLAS.  It wasn&#8217;t widely known how much new we&#8217;d see; they don&#8217;t have any more data than they had in December, since the LHC has been on winter shut-down since then, but ATLAS especially still hasn&#8217;t presented all of the results based on its 2011 data, so they may present new information.  The expectation was that the impact of today&#8217;s new results would be incremental; whatever we learned today wouldn&#8217;t dramatically change the situation.  The Tevatron results will certainly cause a minor ruckus, though, because there will surely be controversy about them, by their very nature.  <a title="Awaiting Higgs News from the Tevatron Experiments" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/06/awaiting-higgs-news-from-the-tevatron-experiments/" target="_blank">I gave you a sense for that yesterday.</a>  They aren&#8217;t likely to convince doubters.  But they <del>might</del> provide more pieces of evidence in favor of a lightweight Higgs (though not necessarily at the value of around 125 GeV/c<sup>2</sup> currently preferred by ATLAS and CMS; see below.)</p>
<p>There are two things I didn&#8217;t explain yesterday that are probably worth knowing about.</p>
<p>First, if you look at Figure 2 in<a title="Awaiting Higgs News from the Tevatron Experiments" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/06/awaiting-higgs-news-from-the-tevatron-experiments/" target="_blank"> my post from yesterday</a>, you&#8217;ll notice that the shape of the Higgs signal at the Tevatron experiments is very broad.  It doesn&#8217;t have a nice sharp peak at the mass of the Higgs (115 GeV in the figure).  This is because (as I discussed yesterday) it is hard to measure jets very precisely.  For this reason CDF and DZero will be able to address the question: &#8220;<strong>is there or is there not a lightweight Higgs-like particle</strong>&#8221;, but they will not easily be able to address the question &#8220;<strong>is its mass 115 GeV, 120 GeV, 125 GeV or 130 GeV?</strong>&#8221; very well.  So we&#8217;re really talking about them addressing something only slightly beyond a Yes-No question &#8212; and one which requires them to understand their backgrounds really well.  This is to be contrasted with <a title="Holiday Higgs Hints: Confidence-Inspiring or Not?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/holiday-higgs-hints-confidence-inspiring-or-not/" target="_blank">the two-photon and four-lepton results from ATLAS and CMS</a>, which with more data are the only measurements, in my view, that can really hope to establish a signal of a Higgs particle in a completely convincing way.  These are the only measurements that will see something that could not be mimicked by a mis-estimated background.</p>
<p>Second, the key to the CDF and DZero measurements is being able to identify jets that come from a bottom quark or anti-quark &#8212; a technique which is called &#8220;b-tagging the jets&#8221; &#8212; because, <a title="Awaiting Higgs News from the Tevatron Experiments" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/06/awaiting-higgs-news-from-the-tevatron-experiments/" target="_blank">as I described yesterday</a>, they are looking for Higgs decays to a bottom quark and a bottom antiquark, so they want to keep events that have two b-tagged jets and throw away others.  I have finished a new short article that explains <a title="B-tagging: Identifying Jets from Bottom Quarks" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/jets-the-manifestation-of-quarks-and-gluons/b-tagging-identifying-jets-from-bottom-quarks/" target="_blank">the basic principles are behind b-tagging</a>, so you can get an idea of what the experimenters are actually doing to enhance the Higgs signal and reduce their backgrounds.  Now b-tagging is never perfect; you will miss some jets from bottom quarks, and accidentally pick up some that don&#8217;t come from bottom quarks.  But one part of making the Tevatron measurement  involves making their b-tagging techniques better and better.  CDF, at least, has already claimed in public that they&#8217;ve done this.</p>
<p>Will update this after information becomes available and when time permits.</p>
<p>UPDATES: New Tevatron Results and New ATLAS Results</p>
<p><strong>New Tevatron Results</strong></p>
<p>Tevatron claims a lightweight Higgs; to be precise, the combination of the two experiments CDF and DZero is incompatible with the absence of a lightweight Higgs at 2.2 standard deviations (or &#8220;sigmas&#8221;), after the look elsewhere effect.  CDF sees a larger effect than DZero; but the CDF data analysis method seems more aggressive.   But both methods are far too complicated for me to evaluate.</p>

<p>2.2 sigma is not much, and excesses of this size come and go all the time.  We even saw that several times this past year. But you can certainly view today&#8217;s result from the Tevatron experiments as another step forward toward a convincing case, when you combine it with what ATLAS and CMS currently see.  At minimum, <em>assuming</em> that the Higgs particle is of Standard Model type (the simplest possible type of Higgs particle), <em><strong>what CDF and DZero claim is certainly consistent with <a title="This Week’s Step Forward in the Search for the Higgs Particle" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/02/09/this-weeks-step-forward-in-the-search-for-the-higgs-particle/">the moderate evidence that ATLAS and CMS are observing</a>.  </strong></em></p>
<p>There&#8217;s more content in that statement than you might think.  For example, if there were two Higgs particles, rather than one, the rate for the process CDF and DZero are measuring could easily be <em>reduced</em> somewhat relative to the Standard Model.  In this case they wouldn&#8217;t have found even the hint they&#8217;ve got.  (I explained why <a title="Awaiting Higgs News from the Tevatron Experiments" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/06/awaiting-higgs-news-from-the-tevatron-experiments/">yesterday, toward the end of the post.</a>)  Meanwhile the process that ATLAS and CMS are measuring might <em>not</em> be reduced in such a scenario, and could even be larger &#8212; so it would certainly be possible, if there were a <strong><em>non</em></strong>-Standard-Model-like Higgs at 125 GeV, for ATLAS and CMS to see some evidence, and CDF and DZero to see none.  That has not happened.  If you take the CDF and DZero hint seriously, it points &#8212; vaguely &#8212; toward a lightweight <em>Standard-Model-like</em> Higgs.  Or more accurately, <em>it does not point <strong>away</strong> from a lightweight Standard-Model-like Higgs.</em></p>
<p>However, we do have to keep in mind that, as I noted, CDF and DZero can only say the Higgs mass seems as though it might be in the range 115 to 135 GeV; they cannot nail it down better than that, using their methods, for the reasons I explained earlier.  So their result is consistent with a Standard Model Higgs particle  at 125 GeV, which would agree with the hints at ATLAS and CMS, but it is <strong>also</strong> consistent with one at 120 GeV, which would not agree.   Thus Tevatron bolsters the case for a lightweight Higgs, but would be consistent both with the current hints at LHC and with other parts of the range that the LHC experiments have not yet excluded.  If the current ATLAS and CMS hints went away with more data, the Tevatron results might still be correct, and in that case ATLAS and CMS would start  seeing hints at a different mass.</p>
<p>But given what ATLAS and CMS see: <a title="Holiday Higgs Hints: Confidence-Inspiring or Not?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/holiday-higgs-hints-confidence-inspiring-or-not/">the evidence from December</a>, and <a title="This Week’s Step Forward in the Search for the Higgs Particle" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/02/09/this-weeks-step-forward-in-the-search-for-the-higgs-particle/">the step forward in January with the CMS update in their two-photon data</a>, something around 125 GeV remains the most likely value mass for a Standard Model Higgs.  The issue cannot be considered settled yet, but so far nothing has gotten in the way of this hypothesis.</p>
<p>Now, the inevitable caveats.</p>
<p>First, as with any measurement, these results cannot automatically be assumed to be correct; indeed most small excesses go away when more data is accumulated, either because they are statistical fluctuations or because of errors that get tracked down &#8212; but unfortunately we will not get any more data from the now-closed Tevatron to see if that will happen.  The plausibility of Tevatron&#8217;s claims needs to be evaluated, and (in contrast to <a title="Holiday Higgs Hints: Confidence-Inspiring or Not?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/holiday-higgs-hints-confidence-inspiring-or-not/">the two photon and four lepton results from ATLAS and CMS, which are relatively straightforward to understand</a>) this won&#8217;t be easy or uncontroversial.  The CDF and DZero people did a very fancy analysis with all sorts of clever tricks, which has the advantage that it makes the measurement much more powerful, but the disadvantage of making it obscure to those who didn&#8217;t perform it.</p>
<p>One other caveat is that we will have to be a little cautious literally combining results from Tevatron with those from the LHC.  There&#8217;s<del> no sense in which</del> <em>[this statement is factually incorrect as stated, as commenters from CDF are pointing out; there are indeed several senses in which it was done blind.  I should have been more precise about what was meant, which was more of a general knowledge of how difficult it is to avoid bias in determining the backgrounds for this measurement.  Let me add that this is not meant to suggest anything about CDF, or DZero, in particular; doing any measurement of this type is extraordinarily difficult, and those who did it deserve applause.  But they&#8217;re still human.]</em> the Tevatron result was done `blind&#8217;; it was done with full knowledge that LHC already has a hint at 125,  and since the Tevatron is closed and all its data is final, this is Tevatron&#8217;s last chance (essentially) to contribute to the Higgs particle search.  Combining experiments is fine if they are truly independent; if they are not, you are at risk of bolstering what you believe because you believe it, rather than because nature says it.</p>
<p><strong>New ATLAS results </strong></p>
<p>ATLAS has now almost caught up with CMS, in that its searches for Higgs particles decaying to two photons and to two lepton/anti-lepton pairs (or &#8220;four leptons&#8221; for short) have now been supplemented by <em>(preliminary! i.e., not yet publication-ready)</em> results in searches for Higgs particles decaying to</p>
<ul>
<li>a lepton, anti-lepton, neutrino and anti-neutrino</li>
<li>a tau lepton/anti-lepton pair</li>
<li>a bottom quark/anti-quark pair (which is what CDF and DZero looked for too)</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:25px;"><em>(The only analysis ATLAS is missing is <a title="This Week’s Step Forward in the Search for the Higgs Particle" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/02/09/this-weeks-step-forward-in-the-search-for-the-higgs-particle/">the one that CMS added in January, separating out events with two photons along with two jets.</a>)</em> In contrast to the CMS experiment, which found small excesses (just 1 sigma) above expectation in each of these three channels, ATLAS <strong>does not</strong>.  <em>[And I&#8217;ve been reminded to point out that the first channel has changed; in December, with 40% of the data analyzed, there <strong>was</strong> a small excess.]</em> So CDF and DZero&#8217;s results from today take us a step forward toward a convincing case, while ATLAS&#8217;s result takes us a <del>small</del> step backward.  That&#8217;s par for the course in science when you&#8217;re squinting to see something that&#8217;s barely visible.</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:25px;">But one can&#8217;t get too excited about this.  Statistics are still so low in these measurements that it would be easy for this to happen.  And determining the backgrounds in these measurements is tough.  If you make a mistake in a background estimation, you could make a small excess appear where there really isn&#8217;t one, <strong>or</strong> you could make a real excess disappear.  It cuts both ways.</span></p>
<p>But actually there is a really important result coming out of ATLAS today; it is the <em><strong>deficit</strong></em> of events in the search for the Higgs decaying to a tau lepton/anti-lepton pairs.  For a putative Higgs below 120 GeV, ATLAS sees even fewer tau lepton/anti-lepton events than it expected from pure background &#8212; in other words, the background appears to have fluctuated low.  But this means there is not likely to be a Standard Model-like Higgs signal there, because the likelihood that the background plus a Higgs signal would have fluctuated <strong><em>very</em></strong> low is small.  <em>[UPDATE: actually, looking again, I think I am somewhat overstating the importance of this deficit in taus compared to the lack of excess in the other two channels, which is also important. To be quantitative about this would require more information.  In any case, the conclusion is the same.]</em>    <strong>And this allows ATLAS to exclude new regions in the mass range for the Standard Model Higgs, at 95% confidence!</strong></p>
<p>This is very important!  One of the things that I have complained about with regard to those who&#8217;ve overplayed the December Higgs hints is that you can&#8217;t really say that the evidence for a Higgs around 125 GeV is good if you can&#8217;t start excluding both above and below that mass.  Well, ATLAS has started to do that.  Granted, it isn&#8217;t 99% exclusion, and since this is the Higgs we&#8217;re talking about, we need high standards.  But at 95% confidence, ATLAS now excludes, for a Standard Model Higgs, 110-117.5, 118.5-122.5, and 129-539 GeV.  Said better, <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em><strong>if there is a Standard Model Higgs in nature, ATLAS alone restricts it (to 95% confidence only, however) to the range 117.5 &#8211; 118.5 GeV or 122 &#8211; 129 GeV.</strong></em></span></p>

What is shown is how large a Higgs signal can be excluded, in units of the Standard Model expectation, as a function of the Higgs mass.  Anywhere the solid line dips below the dotted line marked &quot;1&quot; is a place where the Standard Model is 95% excluded.  The red dotted line indicates how well this experiment would perform, on average, if there were no Standard Model Higgs signal.</p></div>
<p>The window is closing.  Not only has ATLAS completely excluded the old hints of a Standard Model Higgs at 115 from the LEP collider, it seems it has probably excluded CMS&#8217;s hint around 120, which was the next best option for the Higgs after 125.  <del>And as far as I can tell, this is coming mainly from the tau lepton/anti-lepton measurement</del> <em>As I said above in an update, I think it is really a mix of all three channels&#8230; hard to be quantitative about that without talking to the experts.</em></p>
<p>So <strong>if</strong> the Standard Model Higgs is what nature has to offer us, we&#8217;re probably down to a tiny little slice around 118 GeV for which there&#8217;s no evidence, and a window that has 125 GeV smack in the middle of it, where the evidence, though <del>not much stronger today, if we include both Tevatron and ATLAS, than it was yesterday, is certainly no weaker.</del></p>
<p>UPDATE: Well, it&#8217;s been pointed out to me by the first commenter that the last statement is misleading, because it doesn&#8217;t emphasize how the ATLAS excess at 126 GeV has decreased substantially  in significance. Somehow I thought originally that the decrease was marginal. But it isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>The statistics numbers as I think I have them now: <span style="color:#800000;"><strong>What was previously about 3.5 sigma local significance for the Higgs-like peak at 125 GeV is now down to 2.5, and what seemed only 1% likely in December to be a fluctuation is now 10% likely.</strong></span></p>
<p>There is an issue, however, with combining many measurements.  Of course the two-photon and four-lepton results from ATLAS are the same as before, and they are just as significant; nothing changed.  But the other three measurements came in low, and that pulls the significance of the combination down.  However, I must remind you again how difficult the last three measurements are.  I would trust the first two before the last three.  So I think we should be careful not to overinterpret this change.   When you combine what you trust most with what you trust least, you reduce your confidence in what you have.</p>
<p>That said, it also indicates why one should be very cautious with small amounts of data.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The search for the <a title="The Higgs FAQ 1.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/360-2/" target="_blank">Higgs particle</a> has been dominated recently by the new kids on the block, the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC], who benefit from the LHC&#8217;s record high energy per collision. But at its predecessor, the <a title="The Tevatron Comes to an End" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/09/30/the-tevatron-comes-to-an-end/" target="_blank">now-closed Tevatron</a>, the CDF and DZero experiments still have a few tricks up their sleeves. Though the energy per collision in recent years at the Tevatron was 3.5 times smaller than was the LHC&#8217;s  in 2011,  CDF and DZero have twice as much data as do ATLAS and CMS right now. And there&#8217;s one more thing going for them. In contrast to the LHC, where protons collide with protons, at the Tevatron <strong>protons collided with antiprotons</strong>. That gives the Tevatron a little edge in one particular search mode for the Higgs. It won&#8217;t be enough to beat the LHC at the game for which it was designed, but it&#8217;s enough that the Tevatron experiments can at least play. And we&#8217;ll see results from the two experiments tomorrow (Wednesday) &#8212; with a preview already publicly available, as you&#8217;ll see below.<span id="more-2892"></span></p>
<p>If the Higgs particle has a mass somewhere around 115-130 <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/" target="_blank">GeV</a>/c<sup>2</sup>  ATLAS and CMS should eventually be able to measure several of its production rates and decay rates.  But the Tevatron experiments CDF and DZero are essentially limited to the two <a title="Production of the Standard Model Higgs Particle" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/production-of-the-standard-model-higgs-particle/" target="_blank">production modes</a></p>
<ul>
<li>quark + anti-quark &#8211;&gt; virtual W particle &#8211;&gt; W + Higgs</li>
<li>quark + anti-quark &#8211;&gt; virtual Z particle &#8211;&gt; Z + Higgs</li>
</ul>
<p>which are relatively small.  <em><a title="Virtual Particles: What are they?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/virtual-particles-what-are-they/">(Click here to learn what a virtual particle is, and isn&#8217;t.)</a></em> Then they can only separate out these collisions when the <a title="Decays of the Standard Model Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/decays-of-the-standard-model-higgs/" target="_blank">Higgs decays</a> in a particular way,</p>
<ul>
<li>Higgs &#8211;&gt; bottom quark + bottom anti-quark</li>
</ul>
<p>which is very common, and only when the W and Z decay in particular ways,</p>
<ul>
<li>W &#8211;&gt; electron or muon + anti-neutrino</li>
<li>Z &#8211;&gt; neutrino + anti-neutrino or electron + anti-electron [&#8220;positron&#8221;] or muon + anti-muon</li>
</ul>
<p>which happens roughly about 1/4 of the time.</p>
<p>But in these particular modes, the Tevatron experiments can do better (for now, anyway) than the experiments at the LHC. One of multiple reasons is that the LHC&#8217;s protons have relatively few anti-quarks with sufficient energy to combine with a quark to make a W or Z plus a Higgs in a proton-proton collision, while the Tevatron&#8217;s anti-protons have plenty of anti-quarks ready to do the job. To understand this better, you will need to understand more about <a title="A Few More Facts About Protons" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/02/15/a-few-more-facts-about-protons/" target="_blank">the proton&#8217;s structure, which is described here</a>. <em>[For the anti-proton, just &#8220;anti-&#8221; everything: take the discussion of the proton and switch the quarks with the anti-quarks, leaving the gluons (which are their own anti-particles) as they were.]</em></p>
<p>When one of these collisions happens, what is observed in the detector is the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>two <a title="Jets: The Manifestation of Quarks and Gluons" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/jets-the-manifestation-of-quarks-and-gluons/" target="_blank">jets <em>[sprays of hadrons]</em></a>, one from the bottom quark and one from the anti-quark, both of which are &#8220;b-tagged&#8221; <em>[i.e. show signs of having contained a <a title="What’s a Hadron?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-hadron-as-in-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">hadron</a> that itself contained a b quark or a b anti-quark &#8212; something I&#8217;ll explain elsewhere.]</em></li>
<li>zero, one or two `leptons&#8217; <em>(here a shorthand generically meaning electrons, muons, or their anti-particles),</em> and, if the number of leptons is less than two, signs of undetected particles <em>(an imbalance in the total momentum of the jets and [if present] the lepton)</em></li>
</ul>

This event is likely a background process (see Figure 2) but might come from a collision that creates a W particle (responsible for the electron and anti-neutrino) and a Higgs particle (responsible for the two jets.)</p></div>
<p>Unfortunately, there are many other processes that occur at the Tevatron (and even more at the LHC) that look essentially the same, in the detector, as what I just described. <em>[These are what we call &#8220;backgrounds&#8221; to the Higgs process, which we call the &#8220;signal.&#8221;  <a title="Why The Hints of Higgs Currently Rest on Uncertain Ground" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/why-the-hints-of-higgs-currently-rest-on-uncertain-ground/" target="_blank">Read about the meaning and use of these terms here.</a>]</em> For example, when a W particle and a Z particle are produced together,  the W particle may decay to an electron and an anti-neutrino and the Z particle may decay to a bottom quark/anti-quark pair. The only way to tell the difference between this and a collision that makes W+Higgs  is that the two jets from the bottom quark and anti-quark together have energies and momenta consistent with having come from a particle of mass of about 91 GeV/c<sup>2</sup> (the mass of the Z particle) and not, say, 125 GeV/c<sup>2 </sup>(which might or might not be the mass of the Higgs particle.) <em>[Technically, it is the <a title="Invariant Mass" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-invariant-mass/" target="_blank">invariant mass</a> of the two jets that one computes to see whether it is somewhat close to 91 GeV/c<sup>2</sup>; see below.]</em>And the energies and momenta of jets cannot be measured very precisely.  Consequently, picking out the Higgs signal is not so easy.</p>
<p>To see this &#8212; and to see a preview of what we will face when CDF and DZero present their results &#8212; look at Figure 2 below, which was shown at the La Thuile conference by Homer Wolfe, representing the CDF experiment. What the plot shows is the number of events observed for a given invariant mass of the two b-tagged jets, for collisions that look similar to what is shown in Figure 1. You can see predictions<em> [a combination of theoretical calculations and inferences from other data samples]</em> for various background processes, shown in colors.</p>
<ul>
<li>The largest (dark green) involves production of a W particle along with random production, via the strong nuclear force, of a bottom quark and bottom anti-quark.</li>
<li>The blue represents a W combined with a Z, the case I mentioned above; notice it peaks actually a bit above 91 GeV, and is quite wide. <em>[This tells you how hard it is to measure the mass of a particle that decays to a bottom-quark jet and a bottom-antiquark jet; the result is not very precise.]</em></li>
<li>And the third large process, in yellow, is from production of a top quark and a top antiquark, which collectively decay to two W particles and a bottom quark and anti-quark; if one of the W&#8217;s decays to a lepton and a neutrino, while the other decays to jets (as often happens) then the result is background to the Higgs signal.</li>
</ul>
<p>And finally, the red line shows what the signal of the simplest possible Higgs particle [<a title="The Standard Model Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/" target="_blank">the &#8220;Standard Model Higgs&#8221;</a>] of mass 115 GeV/c<sup>2</sup> would look like &#8212;<span style="color:#800080;"><strong> if it were multiplied by five</strong></span>! In other words, the white region between the red curve and the green region will be five times smaller in the Standard Model than is shown on the graph.   This tells you that CDF and DZero are looking for <strong><em>a very small effect on a very substantial background</em></strong>. If the Standard Model Higgs is present in nature, this measurement is not going to provide a smoking gun.  It will provide at best another hint.</p>

<p>One can&#8217;t help noticing, though, that in the region where the red curve is largest, many of the black dots &#8212; the data &#8212; lie well above the sum of the predicted backgrounds (green curve).  Hmmm&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Should we get excited?</strong></p>
<p>Mayyyybe&#8230;</p>
<p>But I&#8217;d advise against it.  If you&#8217;ve been keeping track, you know we&#8217;ve seen a significant number of excesses at the Tevatron and the LHC in the past year. Most were small. There was <a title="Why The Hints of Higgs Currently Rest on Uncertain Ground" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/why-the-hints-of-higgs-currently-rest-on-uncertain-ground/" target="_blank">the summer&#8217;s excess in the Higgs search</a>. Remember those &#8220;hints of a Higgs particle&#8221; from July? Like most small excesses,  <a title="Higgs Search: ATLAS and CMS Summer Data Combined" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/lhcposts/higgs-search-atlas-and-cms-summer-data-combined/" target="_blank">they went away when more data was collected and certain potential errors in the analysis were corrected</a>. There was the excess in multi-leptons (here are articles <a title="Something Curious at the Large Hadron Collider" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/10/19/something-curious-at-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">1</a> and <a title="A Second Look at the Curious CMS Events" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/10/20/a-second-look-at-the-curious-cmsevents/" target="_blank">2</a>); that hasn&#8217;t disappeared, but <a title="News from La Thuile, with Much More to Come" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/05/news-from-la-thuile-with-much-more-to-come/" target="_blank">gathering more data didn&#8217;t make it more convincing</a>, which is a bad sign. The <a title="A Rare and Interesting Decay of a “B meson” – update 2" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/tevatron-news/a-rare-and-interesting-decay-of-a-b-meson/" target="_blank">excess in the rate at which certain B mesons decay to a muon and an anti-muon</a> went away [and in fact <a href="http://indico.in2p3.fr/getFile.py/access?contribId=72&amp;sessionId=11&amp;resId=0&amp;materialId=slides&amp;confId=6001" target="_blank">a new limit on this process was just announced by the LHCb experiment.</a>] There were <a title="Holiday Higgs Hints: Confidence-Inspiring or Not?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/holiday-higgs-hints-confidence-inspiring-or-not/" target="_blank">four events at CDF with two leptons and two anti-leptons, which were consistent with a particle of mass of about 325 GeV/c<sup>2</sup></a>. But these went unconfirmed by CDF itself (looking for other signs of the same particle) and also by the other experiments. Then there was <a title="Apparent Unexpected Asymmetries in the Production of Quarks" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/tevatron-news/apparent-unexpected-asymmetries-in-the-production-of-quarks/" target="_blank">the excess at CDF and DZero in the asymmetry for top quarks that I wrote about</a>, which too is <a title="News from La Thuile, with Much More to Come" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/05/news-from-la-thuile-with-much-more-to-come/" target="_blank">in danger of turning out to be a false alarm</a>.</p>
<p>So. I&#8217;m not particularly excited.  Excesses, either due to random chance or due to a mistake in understanding the backgrounds to a signal, happen all the time.</p>
<p>By the way, two excesses that are still alive and kicking are <a title="This Week’s Step Forward in the Search for the Higgs Particle" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/02/09/this-weeks-step-forward-in-the-search-for-the-higgs-particle/" target="_blank">those showing up in the search for the Standard Model Higgs particle at ATLAS and CMS</a> (which are still too small to merit confidence, in my view, but are certainly more compelling than were/are most of the others I&#8217;ve mentioned) and the observation of CP violation in D meson decays, first <a title="A Notable Discrepancy at the LHCb Experiment" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/11/16/a-notable-discrepancy-at-the-lhcb-experiment/" target="_blank">at LHCb</a> and then <a title="LHCb’s Result From November Appears Confirmed by CDF" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/01/lhcbs-result-from-november-appears-confirmed-by-cdf/" target="_blank">at CDF</a> (though it is no longer so clear what the theoretical prediction is in this case.)</p>
<p>And let&#8217;s not forget that ATLAS found, rather convincingly, <a title="A New Particle at the LHC? Yes, But…" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/12/22/a-new-particle-at-the-lhc-yes-but/" target="_blank">evidence for a new state of the &#8220;atom&#8221; made from a bottom quark and a bottom anti-quark</a>.  I mention this just to reassure you that not every excess goes away. Sometimes nature really does have something for us to identify, study, put into our textbooks and pass on to future generations.</p>
<p><strong>What Might Lead to Such an Excess?</strong></p>
<p>Ok, back to the plot in Figure 2, and the excess that it shows.   <em>I expect we&#8217;ll see six similar plots (at least), three from CDF (for W + Higgs, Z + Higgs where the Z decays to neutrinos, and Z + Higgs where the Z decays to a lepton/anti-lepton pair) and a similar three from DZero.  We&#8217;ll be watching to see if all six show a similar feature.  </em>What might be causing this excess?</p>
<p>One possibility is that the excess on this plot is due to <strong>random chance</strong> &#8212; a few extra events just due to statistics. Only CDF can tell us what that probability is, but it doesn&#8217;t look that high to me.</p>
<p>Another possibility, much more likely to my eye and based on my experience, is that it is due to <strong>mis-estimating one of the backgrounds</strong>. That happens all the time. CDF, of course, will tell us that&#8217;s not possible, but experts outside of CDF will all be suitably skeptical, as we always are in this type of measurement.</p>
<p>In fact one can argue a very similar mis-estimate must have afflicted CDF in a similar (but importantly different) measurement, one that got a huge amount of press in April 2011, with <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-13000253" target="_blank">articles irresponsibly hailing the excess seen there as a &#8220;potential discovery of a new particle&#8221;</a>. Skepticism in the particle physics community was quite a bit higher than in the press, though it should have been higher still. I must emphasize, though, that CDF&#8217;s April 2011 result has not convincingly been refuted even now, though there&#8217;s no sign of any confirmation. <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110610/full/news.2011.361.html" target="_blank">DZero does not see the same effect</a>, but since they do something slightly different from CDF, it&#8217;s hard to be sure whether the CDF result is clearly refuted, especially since CDF and DZero have been unable to agree as to which of the two experiments is making the mistake.  And CDF has done more analysis and claims the excess is still there. CMS and ATLAS don&#8217;t see anything like this, but again one can argue that this process is hard to study at the LHC. <strong>This is all to say that measurements of this type are particularly difficult, and prone to controversy and error.</strong></p>
<p>Similar issues were also probably partly responsible for the hints of a Higgs particle last summer.  I wrote a lot about <a title="Why The Hints of Higgs Currently Rest on Uncertain Ground" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/why-the-hints-of-higgs-currently-rest-on-uncertain-ground/" target="_blank">why those hints rested on uncertain ground</a>, and if you read that old article you&#8217;ll see, when I discuss broad excesses in the context of a Higgs decaying to two W particles, that the excess back then that caused all the ruckus bore some mild similarity to the excess in Figure 2, which is likely to cause this week&#8217;s ruckus.</p>
<p>A third possibility is that <strong>the excess is due to the Higgs signal being much larger than expected</strong>.  That, of course, would be very exciting.  However&#8230; <em><strong>while logically possible, it is unlikely, for very profound reasons.</strong></em> To understand why requires us to explore the very heart of the Higgs mechanism.</p>
<p><strong>Why is it unlikely that the signal is much larger in nature than predicted in the Standard Model?</strong></p>
<p>Logically speaking, there are three ways that CDF&#8217;s signal could be larger than expected.</p>
<p>First, <em>perhaps the production rate for W + Higgs or Z + Higgs was miscalculated by theorists, and it is larger than people thought?</em> This seems very unlikely. Very similar calculations are needed to predict the production rates for processes in which two W particles are produced in a collision, or in which a W and a Z particle are produced together. <em><strong>And the calculations agree well with the measurements of these rates.</strong></em> (In fact, you can see some evidence that the calculations are pretty accurate in Figure 2.  Imagine how the graph would look different if the blue peak were made twice as big as expected; this would in turn push up the green peak, putting it well above the data [the black dots] at the highest point.) Estimates of the uncertainties in the probabilities for W + Higgs and Z + Higgs production are in the 10% range, not 100%.</p>
<p>Second, <em>perhaps the Higgs particle is not at all a Standard-Model-like Higgs, and the production rate for W + Higgs or Z + Higgs is intrinsically much larger than in the Standard Model?</em> As I emphasized in my articles on how the Standard Model Higgs particle <a title="Production of the Standard Model Higgs Particle" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/production-of-the-standard-model-higgs-particle/" target="_blank">is produced</a>, <a title="Decays of the Standard Model Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/decays-of-the-standard-model-higgs/" target="_blank">decays</a>, and <a title="Seeking and Studying the Standard Model Higgs Particle" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/seeking-and-studying-the-standard-model-higgs-particle/" target="_blank">is searched for</a>, one of the really important things about W + Higgs and Z + Higgs production is that its size in the Standard Model is determined by the Higgs mechanism itself &#8212; <strong><em>the fact that the W and Z particles get their masses from the Higgs field is directly tied to the probability of making W or Z + Higgs at the Tevatron and at the LHC</em></strong>. Moreover, if the Higgs particle is different from what it is in the Standard Model &#8212; if there are several Higgs particles, for instance &#8212;<em><strong> the W + Higgs and Z + Higgs production rates can only decrease!</strong></em>  You can take my word for that, or, if you&#8217;re willing to stomach a little bit of technical argument, I&#8217;ll explain why in the next section.</p>
<p>Finally, <em>perhaps the probability for the <a title="Decays of the Standard Model Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/decays-of-the-standard-model-higgs/" target="_blank">Higgs to decay </a>to a bottom quark/anti-quark pair is much larger than in the Standard Model?</em> But that probability is already very large (see Figure 1 of <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/decays-of-the-standard-model-higgs/" target="_blank">this article</a>), 80% for a Higgs of mass 115 GeV/c<sup>2</sup>,  and 60% for one of 125 GeV/c<sup>2</sup>.  <em><strong>Since you can&#8217;t make the probability bigger than 100%, there&#8217;s almost nowhere to go.</strong></em> Such a change can&#8217;t produce an increase in the observed rate of more than about a factor of about 1.2 for a Higgs at 115 and about 1.6 for a Higgs at 125.   Moreover, if you do this, it can become difficult (but not impossible) to  make everything seen in 2011 by ATLAS, CMS and (given Figure 2) CDF consistent at the same time.  On the other hand, maybe part or all of the hints at ATLAS and CMS are <em>themselves</em> just small excesses destined to disappear.  So for the moment we have to keep an open mind.</p>
<p>Ok, that&#8217;s probably all that can be said before we actually see the data from CDF and DZero. Obviously there will be a lot more to say once we actually see the interpretation of Figure 2, the other two similar plots from CDF, and the three corresponding plots from DZero&#8230; and when we see how the statistical analysis of those plots works itself out.  Til tomorrow!  <em>(Or read on to learn why it is very tough to make the W+Higgs and Z+Higgs production rates larger than for a Standard Model Higgs particle.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Quasi-Technical Section: Why the Rate for W + Higgs and Z + Higgs Production can only be Smaller than in the Standard Model</strong></p>
<p><em>The following section, partly quoted from my <a title="The Standard Model Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/" target="_blank">Standard Model Higgs articles</a>, is a tiny bit technical.  However, even if you have no technical background but still feel you can follow algebra, you may find yourself comfortable with this argument. Give it a try! It&#8217;s not so hard.</em></p>
<p>Schematically, here&#8217;s how the Higgs mechanism works: before the Higgs field has a non-zero value, the world allows interactions of the form</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>H H</strong> W W</em></li>
<li><em><strong>H H</strong> Z Z</em></li>
</ul>
<p>where &#8220;<strong>H</strong>&#8221; here is the Higgs field <a title="The Known Particles — If The Higgs Field Were Zero" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-particles-if-the-higgs-field-were-zero/" target="_blank">when its average value is zero</a>, and &#8220;W&#8221; and &#8220;Z&#8221; are the W and Z fields with corresponding <strong>massless</strong> W and Z particles. There is no interaction involving just one Higgs particle at a time. But once the Higgs field develops its <a title="The Higgs FAQ 1.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/360-2/" target="_blank">non-zero average constant value throughout all of space and time</a> (its value is usually called &#8220;v&#8221;, historically) then we are motivated to write <strong>H</strong> = v + H, where H represents any difference of <strong>H</strong> from its average value v. When we do this we find</p>
<p><em><strong>H H</strong> Z Z   &#8211;&gt;   <span style="color:#ff0000;">v<sup>2</sup> Z Z</span> + <span style="color:#0000ff;">2 v H Z Z</span> + <span style="color:#339966;">H H Z Z</span></em></p>
<p>The first term, in red, (a constant times Z Z) shifts the energy of a Z particle that is at rest &#8212; in other words, it provides what we call mass-energy! That&#8217;s the Higgs mechanism!  This is how the Higgs field gives the Z particle a mass.</p>
<p>The second term, in blue, allows a virtual Z particle to turn into a Z particle and a Higgs particle (as described <a title="Production of the Standard Model Higgs Particle" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/production-of-the-standard-model-higgs-particle/">here</a>) and makes the process quark + anti-quark &#8211;&gt; Z + Higgs possible.</p>
<p>You notice that  v  appears in both the first term and the second term &#8212; and thus the Z particle&#8217;s mass and the rate for Z + Higgs production are related to each other.  <strong><em>It turns out the production rate, and the square of the Z mass, are both proportional to v<sup>2</sup>.</em></strong></p>
<p>Now suppose the Higgs field is not that of the Standard Model.  For instance, suppose there were two Higgs fields <strong>H </strong>and<strong> <strong>H&#8217;</strong></strong>, and a Higgs particle for each one. What would happen then?  Well, we start with interactions like</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>H H</strong> W W</em></li>
<li><em><strong>H H</strong> Z Z</em></li>
<li><em><strong>H&#8217; H&#8217;</strong> W W</em></li>
<li><em><strong>H&#8217; H&#8217;</strong> Z Z</em></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:25px;">Now imagine both <strong>H </strong>and<strong> <strong>H&#8217;</strong> </strong>become non-zero, and take values  v  and  v&#8217;.  Then when we shift them both, we get</span></p>
<p><em><strong>H H</strong> Z Z   &#8211;&gt;   <span style="color:#ff0000;">v<sup>2</sup> Z Z</span> + <span style="color:#0000ff;">2 v H Z Z</span> + <span style="color:#339966;">H H Z Z</span></em><br />
<em><strong>H&#8217; H&#8217;</strong> Z Z   &#8211;&gt;   <span style="color:#ff0000;">v&#8217;<sup>2</sup> Z Z</span> + <span style="color:#0000ff;">2 v&#8217; H&#8217; Z Z</span> + <span style="color:#339966;">H&#8217; H&#8217; Z Z</span></em></p>
<p>Now the Z particle&#8217;s mass comes from both of the red terms, and is proportional to v<sup>2</sup> + v&#8217;<sup>2</sup>, but the production of Z + the <strong>first</strong> Higgs is proportional to <strong>v<sup>2</sup></strong> while that of  Z + the <strong>second</strong> Higgs is is proportional to <strong>v&#8217;<sup>2</sup></strong>.  But since any real number squared is positive, v<sup>2</sup> &lt; <sup> </sup>v<sup>2</sup> + v&#8217;<sup>2</sup>, and also  v&#8217;<sup>2</sup> &lt; <sup> </sup>v<sup>2</sup> + v&#8217;<sup>2</sup>.  Consequently, relative to the Z particle mass (which we know from experiment) <em><strong>the production rate for either of the two Higgs particles is smaller than it is in the Standard Model</strong></em>.</p>
<p>If the two Higgs particles had exactly the same mass, the sum of the rates would be equal to the rate for Z + Higgs in the Standard Model.  But if one is light and the other heavy, then the rate for Z + the light one is reduced, and the one for Z + the heavy one is very reduced &#8212; just because it is heavy.  No matter what you do, there is no way to make the rate for such a process larger than in the Standard Model.</p>
<p>Everything I&#8217;ve said for the Z is true for the W, too.</p>
<p><em>Well, you might ask, maybe there&#8217;s some other type of process that we can add in that makes the rate for W + Higgs larger than expected. The problem is that this in turn is likely to make the rate for W + Higgs even larger still at the LHC, because any other type of interaction that you add will necessarily grow with energy, and since the LHC has larger energy than the Tevatron, the relative increase in the rate at the LHC would be bigger than at the Tevatron. CMS and ATLAS don&#8217;t yet have enough data to see the Standard Model W + Higgs process with clarity, but if you make that process much larger, it is likely they would already have noticed. In Figure 3 is a plot from CMS, showing they cannot exclude a rate of 3-5 times the Standard Model but showing also that their <strong>observed</strong> rate is only slightly larger than their <strong>expected</strong> rate, which makes it unlikely that the true rate is several times larger than for a Standard Model Higgs particle.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At various conferences in the late fall, the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC] experiments ATLAS and CMS showed us many measurements that they made using data they took in spring and summer of 2011. But during the fall their data sets increased in size by a factor of two and a half!  So far this year the only results we&#8217;d seen that involved the 2011 full data set had been <a title="This Week’s Step Forward in the Search for the Higgs Particle" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/02/09/this-weeks-step-forward-in-the-search-for-the-higgs-particle/">ones needed in the search for the Higgs particle</a>. Last week, that started to change.</p>
<p>The spring flood is just beginning. Many new experimental results from the LHC were announced at <a href="http://www.pi.infn.it/lathuile/lathuile_2012.html" target="_blank">La Thuile</a> this past week, some only using part of the 2011 data but a few using all of it, and more and more will be coming every day for the next couple of weeks. And there are also new results coming from the <a title="The Tevatron Comes to an End" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/09/30/the-tevatron-comes-to-an-end/">(now-closed) Tevatron</a> experiments CDF and DZero, which are completing many analyses that use their full data set. In particular, we&#8217;re expecting them to report on their best crack at the Higgs particle later this week. They can only hope to create controversy; they certainly won&#8217;t be able to settle the issue as to whether there is or isn&#8217;t a Higgs particle with a mass of about 125 <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/">GeV</a>/c<sup>2</sup>, as <a title="Reviewing the Search for the Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/01/24/reviewing-the-search-for-the-higgs/" target="_blank">hints from ATLAS and CMS seem to indicate</a>.  But all indications are that it will be an interesting week on the Higgs front.</p>
<p><strong>The Top Quark Checks In</strong></p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_2873" style="width: 326px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/cms5_topwpol.png"><img loading="lazy" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2873" data-attachment-id="2873" data-permalink="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/05/news-from-la-thuile-with-much-more-to-come/cms5_topwpol/" data-orig-file="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/cms5_topwpol.png" data-orig-size="395,439" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="CMS5_topWpol" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="&lt;p&gt;Fig. 1: A key test of the Higgs mechanism is that when the top quark decays to a bottom quark and a W particle, the W reflects the fact it got its mass from the Higgs field 70% of the time.  This can be tested using the W decay to an anti-neutron and an electron or muon; the direction that the electron or muon takes can be predicted.  The data above shows excellent agreement between theory and experiment, again validating the theory of the Higgs mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

A precise test of this idea arises as follows. When the top quark decays to a bottom quark and a W particle, and the W then decays to an anti-neutrino and an electron or muon, the probability that the electron or muon travels in a particular direction can be predicted assuming the Higgs mechanism. The data above shows excellent agreement between theory and experiment, validating the notion of the Higgs field.</p></div>
<p>There are now many new measurements of the properties of the top quark, poking and prodding it from all sides (figuratively)  to see if it behaves as expected within the &#8220;Standard Model of particle physics&#8221; [the equations that we use to describe all of <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/">the known particles and forces</a> of nature.] And so far, disappointingly for those of us hoping for clues as to why the top quark is so much heavier than the other quarks, there&#8217;s no sign of anything amiss with those equations. Top quarks and anti-quarks are produced in pairs more or less as expected, with the expected rate, and moving in the expected directions with the expected amount of energy. Top quark decay to a W particle and a bottom quark also agrees, in detail, with theoretical expectation.  Specifically (see Figure 1) the orientation of the W&#8217;s intrinsic angular momentum (called its &#8220;spin&#8221;, technically), a key test of the Standard Model in general and of the <a title="The Higgs FAQ 1.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/360-2/">Higgs mechanism</a> in particular, agrees very well with theoretical predictions.  Meanwhile there&#8217;s no sign that there are unexpected ways of producing top quarks, nor any sign of particles that are heavy cousins of the top quark.</p>
<p>One particularly striking result from CMS relates to the unexpectedly large asymmetry in the production of top quarks observed at the Tevatron experiments, which <a title="Apparent Unexpected Asymmetries in the Production of Quarks" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/tevatron-news/apparent-unexpected-asymmetries-in-the-production-of-quarks/">I&#8217;ve previously written about in detail.</a> The number of top quarks produced moving roughly in the same direction as the <em>proton</em> beam is <strong><em>expected</em></strong> theoretically to be only very slightly larger than the number moving roughly in the same direction as the <em>anti-proton</em> beam, but instead both CDF and DZero <em><strong>observe a</strong> <strong>much larger effect</strong></em>. This significant apparent discrepancy between their measurement and the prediction of the Standard Model has generated lots of interest and hope that perhaps we are seeing a crack in the Standard Model&#8217;s equations.</p>
<p>Well, it isn&#8217;t so easy for CMS and ATLAS to make the same measurement, because the LHC has two proton beams, so it is symmetric front-to-back, unlike the Tevatron with its proton beam and anti-proton beam.   But still, there are other related asymmetries that LHC experiments can measure. And CMS has now looked with its full 2011 data set, and observes&#8230; nothing: for a particular charge asymmetry that they can measure, they find an asymmetry of 0.4% +- 1.0% +- 1.2% (the first number is the best estimate and the latter two numbers are the statistical and systematic uncertainties on that estimate).  The Standard Model predicts something of order a percent or so, while many attempts to explain the Tevatron result might have predicted an effect of several percent.  (ATLAS has presented a similar measurement but only using part of the 2011 data set, so it has much larger uncertainties at present.)</p>
<p>Now CMS is not measuring quite the same thing as CDF and DZero, so the CMS result is not in direct conflict with the Tevatron measurements. But if new phenomena were present that were causing the CDF and DZero&#8217;s anomalously large asymmetry, we&#8217;d expect that by now they&#8217;d be starting to show up, at least a little bit, in this CMS measurement.  The fact that CMS sees not a hint of anything unexpected considerably weakens the overall case that the Tevatron excess asymmetry might have an exciting explanation. It suggests rather that the whole effect is really a problem with the interpretation of the Tevatron measurements themselves, or with the ways that the equations of the Standard Model are used to predict them. That is of course disappointing, but it is still far too early to declare the case closed.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a subtle connection here with the recent<a title="LHCb’s Result From November Appears Confirmed by CDF" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/01/lhcbs-result-from-november-appears-confirmed-by-cdf/"> bolstering by CDF</a> of the <a title="A Notable Discrepancy at the LHCb Experiment" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/11/16/a-notable-discrepancy-at-the-lhcb-experiment/">LHCb experiment&#8217;s claim</a> that CP violation is present in the decays of particles called &#8220;D mesons&#8221;. (D mesons are <a title="What’s a Hadron?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-hadron-as-in-large-hadron-collider/">hadrons</a> containing a <strong>charm</strong> quark [or anti-quark], an <strong>up </strong>or<strong> down</strong> anti-quark [or quark], and [as for all hadrons]<a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/"> lots of additional gluons and quark/anti-quark pairs</a>.) The problem is that theorists, who used to be quite sure that any such CP violation in D mesons would indicate the presence of new phenomena not predicted by the Standard Model, are no longer so sure. So one needs corroborating information from somewhere, showing some other related phenomenon, before getting too excited.</p>
<p>One place that such information might have come from is the top quark.  If there is something surprising in charm quarks (but not in bottom quarks) one might easily imagine that perhaps there is something new affecting all up-type quarks (the up quark, charm quark and top quark) more than the down-type quarks (down, strange and bottom.)  <em>[<a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/">Read here about the known elementary particles and how they are organized.</a>]</em> In other words, if the charm quark is different from expectations and the bottom quark is not, it would seem quite reasonable that the top quark would be even more different from expectations. But  unfortunately, the results from this week suggest the top quark, to the level of precision that can currently be mustered, is behaving very much as the Standard Model predicted it would.</p>
<p><strong>Meanwhile Nothing Else Checks In</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the direct search for new particles not predicted by the Standard Model, there were a number of new results from CMS and ATLAS at La Thuile. The talks on these subjects went flying by; there was far too little information presented to allow understanding of any details, and so without fully studying the corresponding papers I can&#8217;t say anything more intelligent yet than that they didn&#8217;t see anything amiss. But of course, <a title="Some thoughts on why there’s so much Tevatron news." href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/07/21/some-thoughts-on-why-theres-so-much-tevatron-news/">as I&#8217;ve suggested many times</a>, searches of this type wouldn&#8217;t be shown so soon after the data was collected if they indicated any discrepancy with theoretical prediction, unless the discrepancy was spectacularly convincing. More likely, they would be delayed a few weeks or even months, while they were double- and triple-checked, and perhaps even held back for more data to be collected to clarify the situation. So we are left with the question as to which of the other measurements that weren&#8217;t shown are appearing later because, well, some things take longer than others, and which ones (if any) are being actively held back because they are more &#8230; interesting. At this preliminary stage in the conference season it&#8217;s too early to start that guessing game.</p>

But above the Z mass, the data (black dots) show a smooth curve with no significant bumps.</p></div>
<p>So here&#8217;s a few words about what ATLAS and CMS didn&#8217;t see. Several classic searches for supersymmetry and other theories that resemble it (in that they show signs of invisible particles, <a title="Jets: The Manifestation of Quarks and Gluons" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/jets-the-manifestation-of-quarks-and-gluons/">jets from high-energy quarks and gluons</a>, and something rare like a lepton or two or a photon), were updated by CMS for the full or near-full data set. Searches for heavy versions of the top and bottom quark were shown by ATLAS and CMS. ATLAS sought heavy versions of the Z particle (see Figure 2) that decay to a high energy electron/positron pair or muon/anti-muon pair; with their full 2011 data set, they now exclude particles of this type up to masses (depending on the precise details of the particle) of 1.75-1.95 TeV/c<sup>2</sup>. Meanwhile CMS looked for heavy versions of the W particle that can decay to an electron or muon and something invisible; the exclusions reach out above 2.5 TeV/c<sup>2</sup>. Other CMS searches using the full data set included ones seeking new particles decaying to two Z particles, or to a W and a Z.   ATLAS looked for a variety of exotic particles, and CMS looked for events that are very energetic and produce many known particles at once.  Most of these searches were actually ones we&#8217;d seen before, just updated with more data, but a few of them were entirely new.</p>
<p>Two CMS searches worth noting involved looking for new undetectable particles recoiling against a single jet or a single photon. These put very interesting constraints on dark matter that are complementary to the searches that have been going on elsewhere, deep underground.  Using vats of liquid xenon or bubble chambers or solid-state devices, physicists have been looking for the very rare process in which a dark matter particle, one among the vast ocean of dark matter particles in which our galaxy is immersed, bumps into an atomic nucleus inside a detector and makes a tiny little signal for physicists to detect. Remarkable and successful as their search techniques are, there are two obvious contexts in which they work very poorly. If dark matter particles are very lightweight, much lighter than a few GeV/c<sup>2</sup>, the effect of one hitting a nucleus becomes very hard to detect. Or if the nature of the interaction of dark matter with ordinary matter is such that it depends on the spin (the intrinsic angular momentum) of a nucleus rather than on how many protons and neutrons the nucleus contains, then the probability of a collision becomes much, much lower. But in either case, as long as dark matter is affected by the weak nuclear force, the LHC can produce dark matter particles, and though ATLAS and CMS can&#8217;t detect them, they can detect particles that might sometimes recoil against them, such as a photon or a<a title="Jets: The Manifestation of Quarks and Gluons" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/jets-the-manifestation-of-quarks-and-gluons/"> jet</a>. So CMS was quite proud to show that their results are complementary to those other classes of experiments.</p>

<p>Finally, <a title="Something Curious at the Large Hadron Collider" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/10/19/something-curious-at-the-large-hadron-collider/">I made a moderately big deal back in October</a> about a small excess in multi-leptons (collisions that produce three or more electrons, muons, positrons [anti-electrons] or antimuons, <a title="Multi-Lepton Events: A Good Place to Look for New Physics" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/multi-lepton-events-a-good-place-to-look-for-new-physics/">which are a good place to look for new phenomena</a>), though I warned you in bold red letters that <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em><strong>most small excesses go away with more data</strong></em></span>. A snippet of an update was shown at La Thuile, and from what I said earlier about results that appear early in the conference season, you know that&#8217;s bad news. Suffice it to say that although discrepancies with theoretical predictions remain, the ones seen in October apparently haven&#8217;t become more striking. The caveat that most small excesses go away applies, so far, to this data set as well. We&#8217;ll keep watching.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s news this week that the CDF experiment at the now-closed Tevatron has updated its result for a measurement of the same quantity, using the full CDF data set.  And they now find a very similar result to what LHCb found.   This is indicated on the slide shown below, taken from the <a href="http://agenda.infn.it/getFile.py/access?contribId=37&amp;sessionId=5&amp;resId=0&amp;materialId=slides&amp;confId=4116" target="_blank">talk given by Angelo Di Canto at the La Thuile conference</a> (but edited by me to fix a big typo; I hope he does not mind.)  You see that while LHCb found a CP-violating asymmetry of -0.82%, with statistical and systematic uncertainties of 0.21% and 0.11%, CDF finds -0.62%, with almost identical uncertainties &#8212; a little closer to zero, but still well away from it.</p>

The CDF result is in orange at the top; the LHCb result is in black just below it. In the figure, the LHCb result is in blue, the CDF result in orange, and the traditional expectation for the Standard Model is very close to the point (0,0), the isolated red dot at dead center.</p></div>
<p style="text-align:left;">This lends support to LHCb&#8217;s result, and putting the two results (and a couple of other weaker ones) together makes their combination discrepant from zero by about 3.8 standard deviations.  That&#8217;s great, but not as great as it would have been if what theorists thought a few years ago was still considered reliable.  Back then, the relevant experts (and I should emphasize I am not one of them) would have told you that they were pretty darn certain that the Standard Model <em>[the equations we use to describe the known particles and forces]</em> could not produce CP violation of this type, and any observation of a non-zero signal would imply the existence of previously unknown particles.  But the experts  have been backing away from this point of view recently, worrying that maybe they know less about how to calculate this in the Standard Model than they used to think.  If we&#8217;re to be sure this is really a sign of new particles in nature, and not just a sign that theorists have trouble predicting this quantity, we&#8217;re going to need additional evidence from another quarter.  And so far, we haven&#8217;t got any.</p>
