										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nothing about quantum physics today, but &#8230; wait, <em>everything</em> is made using quantum physics&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Could you imagine getting a dog to sit absolutely still, while fully awake and listening to voices, for as much as 8 minutes? Researchers trained dogs to do it, then put them in an MRI [Magnetic Resonance Imaging] machine to obtain remarkable studies of how dogs&#8217; brains react to human voices and other emotional forms of human expression. [<a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/nuclear/mri.html" target="_blank">MRI is all about</a> magnetic fields, <a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/" target="_blank">protons</a>, spin, and resonance; particle physics!! more on that another time, perhaps.]   The authors claim this is the first study of its type to compare human brains to those of a non-primate species. Here&#8217;s something from <a href="http://www.cell.com/current-biology/retrieve/pii/S0960982214001237" target="_blank">the scientific article&#8217;s abstract</a>:</p>
<p><em>&#8230;</em><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;"><em>We presented dogs and humans with the same set of vocal and non-vocal stimuli to search for functionally analogous voice-sensitive cortical regions. We demonstrate that voice areas exist in dogs and that they show a similar pattern to anterior temporal voice areas in humans. Our findings also reveal that sensitivity to vocal emotional valence cues engages similarly located non-primary auditory regions in dogs and humans&#8230;</em> </span></p>
<p>So it seems, as dog owners have long suspected, that we&#8217;re not just imagining that our best friends are aware of our moods; they really are similar to us in some important ways.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a BBC article: <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-26276660" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-26276660</a></p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;re done with that, would you like to build up your muscles?  No exercise needed, just call the University of Texas at Dallas.  They&#8217;ve found that <em>&#8220;ordinary fishing line and sewing thread can be cheaply converted to powerful artificial muscles.  The new muscles can lift 100 times more weight and generate 100 times higher mechanical power than a human muscle of the same length and weight&#8230; The muscles are powered thermally by temperature changes, which can be produced electrically, by the absorption of light or by the chemical reaction of fuels.&#8221;</em>  [Quantum Physics = cool!!] The quotation above is from <a href="http://www.utdallas.edu/news/2014/2/21-28701_Researchers-Create-Powerful-Muscles-From-Fishing-L_story-wide.html" target="_blank">an interesting press release from the university</a>, reporting the research which was just published in the journal <em>Science</em>.  I recommend the press release because it mentions several interesting possible applications, including robotics technology  and clothing that adjusts to temperature.  Here&#8217;s also a nice article by Anna Kuchment (who&#8217;s on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/akuchment" target="_blank">here</a>):</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Though evolution left us with many wonderful abilities, it does seem that, year by year, humans are becoming less and less practically useful.   But at least our dogs will comfort us in our obsolescence.</p>
