										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, <a title="BICEP2: New Evidence Of Cosmic Inflation!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/bicep2-new-evidence-of-cosmic-inflation/" target="_blank">yesterday was quite a day</a>, and I&#8217;m still sifting through the consequences.</p>
<p>First things first.  As with all major claims of discovery, <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">considerable caution is advised until the BICEP2 measurement has been verified by some other experiment</span></strong>.   Moreover, even if the measurement is correct, <span style="color:#800080;"><strong>one should not assume that the interpretation in terms of gravitational waves and inflation is correct; this requires more study and further confirmation.</strong></span></p>
<p>The media <strong>is</strong> assuming BICEP2&#8217;s measurement is correct, and that the interpretation in terms of inflation is correct, but leading scientists are not so quick to rush to judgment, and are thinking things through carefully.  Scientists are cautious not just because they&#8217;re trained to be thoughtful and careful but also because <em><strong>they&#8217;ve seen many claims of discovery withdrawn or discredited</strong></em>; discoveries are made when humans go where no one has previously gone, with technology that no one has previously used &#8212; and surprises, mistakes, and misinterpretations happen often.</p>
<p>But in this post, I&#8217;m going to <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">assume</span> <span style="color:#ff9900;">assume</span> <span style="color:#0000ff;">assume</span></strong> that BICEP2&#8217;s results are correct, or essentially correct, and are being correctly interpreted.  Let&#8217;s <strong>assume</strong> that <em>[here&#8217;s <a title="A Primer On Today’s Events" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/a-primer-on-todays-events/" target="_blank">a primer on yesterday&#8217;s result that defines these terms</a>]</em></p>
<ul>
<li>they really have detected &#8220;B-mode polarization&#8221; in the &#8220;CMB&#8221; [Cosmic Microwave Background, the photons (particles of light) that are the ancient, cool glow leftover from <a title="Hot Big Bang" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/hot-big-bang/" target="_blank">the Hot Big Bang</a>]</li>
<li>that this B-mode polarization really is a sign of gravitational waves generated during a brief but dramatic period of <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">cosmic inflation</a> that immediately preceded <a title="Hot Big Bang" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/hot-big-bang/" target="_blank">the Hot Big Bang</a>,</li>
</ul>
<p>Then &#8212; <span style="color:#ff0000;">IF</span> BICEP2&#8217;s results were basically right and were being correctly interpreted concerning inflation &#8212; what would be the implications?</p>
<p>Well&#8230;<strong> <em>Wow&#8230;  </em></strong>They&#8217;d really be quite amazing.<span id="more-7493"></span></p>
<p>Would this story be bigger than the <a title="The Day of the Higgs!!!!  DISCOVERY!!! History Made!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/07/04/the-day-of-the-higgs/" target="_blank">discovery of the Higgs particle</a>?  Certainly <em><strong>at least as</strong></em> big.  To try to compare the two gets us into silly discussions; you can&#8217;t know the long-term implications of a discovery at or near the time it is made.  But the immediate list of implications would certainly be longer.</p>
<p><strong>Some Definitions</strong></p>
<p>Before I start: we&#8217;ll need some definitions, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/some-definitions-for-cosmology/" target="_blank">given in this article</a>, of:</p>
<ul>
<li>A unit of energy called GeV (roughly the mass-energy of a hydrogen atom)</li>
<li>The Planck energy, Planck mass and Planck length (processes involving the Planck energy or mass in a region the size of the Planck length will generally involve both quantum mechanics and gravity [&#8220;quantum gravity&#8221;])</li>
<li>The energy scale associated with dark energy (which is not quite the amount of dark energy &#8212; for one thing, despite the name, dark `energy&#8217; is actually an energy per unit volume.)</li>
</ul>
<p>If any of these is unfamiliar to you, you may want to read <a title="Some Definitions for Cosmology" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/some-definitions-for-cosmology/" target="_blank">that article</a> first and to have it handy, in another tab or window, to serve as a glossary.  You may also want to have my <a title="History of the Universe" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/" target="_blank">History of the Universe</a> or my <a title="A Primer On Today’s Events" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/a-primer-on-todays-events/" target="_blank">BICEP2 Discovery Primer</a> hand.</p>
<p><strong>Implications of BICEP2&#8217;s Discovery &#8212;</strong> <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">IF &#8230; IF &#8230;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">IF IF IF</span></strong> BICEP2&#8217;s measurement is correct, at least roughly, and <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">IF IF IF </span></strong>it is being correctly interpreted, at least roughly, then there&#8217;s a long list of broad implications that I can think of, or that others of my colleagues have pointed out to me in conversations.  Some of them are vague &#8212; areas where the implications are likely to be important but are not yet very clear.  Some of these things were already somewhat implied by the previous experimental successes of the theory of inflation, while some stem directly from BICEP2.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>IF &#8230; IF &#8230;</strong></span></p>
<p>A puzzle that bothered scientists for decades, as to how the observable patch of the universe (i.e. the part that we can actually observe today; the universe may be much, much larger than this &#8212; <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">see here</a>) could be so uniform, would indeed be firmly solved, by a period of <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">cosmic inflation</a>.  The extremely flat geometry of the universe would also now be firmly explained.</p>
<p>We would also have confirmation about how the universe became hot &#8212; about how the Hot Big Bang got started.  The picture would be this: a large amount of <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">dark energy first makes the universe big, via inflation, and then the dark energy turns into energetic particles, making the universe hot (and still expanding, albeit more and more slowly</a> [until <a title="A Nobel Prize That’s No Surprise" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/10/04/a-nobel-prize-thats-no-surprise/" target="_blank">relatively recently</a>]).  Some people like to say that inflation puts the &#8220;Bang&#8221; in &#8220;Big Bang&#8221;, but remember that it also makes the universe flat and uniform and huge (typically much larger than the observable patch) before it heats it up.</p>
<p>The existence of cosmic inflation would itself be another feather in the cap of Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity &#8212; since it is Einstein&#8217;s theory that predicts that the presence of a positive cosmological &#8220;constant&#8221; [not necessarily constant], also known as &#8220;dark `energy&#8217; &#8221; [not really energy, but energy density and negative pressure in just the right combination] actually causes the universe to expand, rather than (as we&#8217;d naively expect from gravity) contract.</p>
<p>And <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">(IF&#8230; IF&#8230;)</span></strong> the confirmation of cosmic inflation would mean that those who pointed it out and its advantages, and developed the idea &#8212; people like Starobinsky, Guth, Steinhardt, Linde &#8212; ought to be able to celebrate (though not all will do so, because they abandoned the idea&#8230;)</p>
<p>Also celebrating would be those who pointed out the possibility of a detectable signal from gravitational waves in the polarization of the CMB, which is what BICEP2 has apparently observed.  I believe these would be Kamionkowsi, Kosowsky, Stebbins, Seljak and Zaldarriaga (but the cosmologists should correct me if I&#8217;m unfair here.)</p>
<p>Were there any doubt left concerning Einstein&#8217;s prediction that gravitational waves exist &#8212; perhaps some leftover worry about the 1993-Nobel-Prize-winning indirect detection of energy carried being off by these waves, via <a href="http://www.astro.cardiff.ac.uk/research/gravity/tutorial/?page=3thehulsetaylor" target="_blank">precision measurements of a pulsar, one of a pair of closely-orbiting neutron stars</a> discovered by Hulse and Taylor &#8212; it would be over.</p>
<p>And if anyone still wasn&#8217;t sure that gravity is due to a spin-two field, not  a spin-zero field, the BICEP2 result would settle the matter; you can&#8217;t get B-mode polarization of the CMB without <a title="A Primer On Today’s Events" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/a-primer-on-todays-events/" target="_blank">combining the spin-two polarization structure of the gravitational waves with Thomson scattering</a>.</p>
<p>If there were any doubt that gravity is controlled, just like everything else, by quantum physics, it would erased; BICEP2&#8217;s observation would imply that just like other fields, which are subject to quantum jitter (i.e., random &#8220;<a title="Quantum Fluctuations and Their Energy" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/quantum-fluctuations-and-their-energy/" target="_blank">fluctuations</a>&#8220;), space and time <em>(somewhat more precisely, the metric that determines distances)</em> undergoes the same type of quantum fluctuations as other fields, fluctuations that <em>any</em> quantum version of Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity would predict.  No details about quantum gravity are needed for this conclusion.</p>
<p><span style="color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">The amount of dark energy required during inflation, in order that BICEP2 could observe this gravitational wave signal, would <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>(IF&#8230; IF&#8230;)</strong></span> be enormous.  The energy scale of dark energy [<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/some-definitions-for-cosmology/" target="_blank">defined here</a>] would be about 10<sup>16</sup> GeV, just about 100 times less than the absolute maximum possible, which is the (reduced) Planck scale.  This need not have been the case!   This energy scale  could have been trillions of times smaller, and yet still given acceptable amounts of inflation of the universe and an acceptable Hot Big BAng.  </span>Amazingly, the dark energy during inflation, if BICEP2 is right, is much larger than it <em>needed</em> to be, and almost as large as it could <em>possibly</em> be!</p>
<p><span style="color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">Moreover, if the energy scale of dark energy [<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/some-definitions-for-cosmology/" target="_blank">defined here</a>] had been just a few times weaker than BICEP2 observes &#8212; 1000 times less than the absolute maximum &#8212; then the gravitational wave signal would have been so faint that it would have been completely drowned out by another process (<a title="A Primer On Today’s Events" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/a-primer-on-todays-events/" target="_blank">lensing of E-mode polarization</a>, the solid red curve on the <a title="BICEP2: New Evidence Of Cosmic Inflation!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/bicep2-new-evidence-of-cosmic-inflation/" target="_blank">first figure here</a>.)  So most of us thought, with this wide range of possibilities, that it was a real long shot that BICEP2, or any future similar experiment, would ever see any signal due to gravitational waves from inflation.  That the gravitational waves would turn out to be large and powerful enough to be observed would be an amazing piece of luck for scientists wanting to understand the universe.  (<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">IF&#8230; IF&#8230;</span></strong>)</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff6600;"><em>[The original version of this paragraph overstated what we&#8217;d know; thanks to my colleagues for pointing out a blunder concerning the heating after inflation.]</em> </span> Also, this would mean we would now have an estimate for how hot the observable patch of the universe could have become <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">after inflation ended and the region containing the observable patch became very hot</a> &#8212; the start of the Hot Big Bang.  The energy scale of the dark energy during inflation determines the maximum possible temperature at the start of the Hot Big Bang, more or less.  To say it another way: after inflation with dark energy of scale 10<sup>16</sup> GeV ended, the universe would have become hot, potentially so hot that the average particle rushing around in the hot dense soup of particles had a motion-energy of 10<sup>16</sup> GeV, though perhaps quite a bit less than this.  That&#8217;s a maximum temperature of as much as 10<sup>29</sup> degrees [yes, that&#8217;s a 1 with 29 zeroes after it!!!]</p>
<p>The Large Hadron Collider&#8217;s data provide direct insights into physics at the energy scale of around 1000 GeV or so.  [The mass-energy mc² of the Higgs particle is 125 GeV.]  The BICEP2 measurement would arguably be our first direct evidence (<span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>IF&#8230; IF&#8230;</strong></span>) concerning physics at higher energy scales than the LHC <em>(though one could argue we have a little information from the existence of neutrino masses.)</em>  And not just a little higher!  Since the scale of the dark energy at inflation is at 10<sup>16</sup> GeV, we&#8217;re talking <strong>10,000,000,000,000 times higher</strong>!!!  We&#8217;ve been trying for years, using various methods, to find evidence concerning how physics works at or near the Planck energy and Planck length.  All previous efforts have come up with nothing; proton decay might have given us insight, but it is too rare if it happens at all; neutrino oscillations haven&#8217;t given a clear pictures; cosmology might have revealed big surprises concerning the Planck energy, but none have previously shown up.  But if BICEP2 is right, then, for the first time, we are seeing phenomena which occurred near this energy scale!</p>
<p>Similarly, data from cosmology has made us very confident that we understand physics in the early universe back to the time when the first <a title="The Nuclei of Atoms: At the Heart of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-nuclei-of-atoms-at-the-heart-of-matter/" target="_blank">atomic nuclei</a> formed during the Hot Big Bang &#8212; a few minutes after the Hot Big Bang started, when the temperature was such that the typical particles had energy of about 0.001 GeV.  And we have had <em>reasonable</em> confidence that we have a decent understanding, using what we&#8217;ve learned about particle physics recently, back to times of a billionth of a second, and temperatures corresponding to an energy of a hundred GeV or so.  But now our understanding may be taking (<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">IF&#8230; IF&#8230;</span></strong>) an enormous leap, back to the very start of the Hot Big Bang, at a temperature corrresponding to an energy of as much as 10<sup>16</sup> GeV, and even earlier, into the frigid inflating universe.</p>
<p>The success of the details of the equations that form the heart of inflationary theory suggests that not only did Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity describe physics at very early times and very high energy scales, the basic principles of quantum field theory worked back then too.  It could easily have been imagined &#8212; and many have imagined, with concrete ideas backed up with equations &#8212; that there might be important principles that we are unaware of, or modifications of the ones we know, that would give very different predictions from standard inflationary theory.  So far, there&#8217;s no sign of that at all.  BICEP2&#8217;s result (<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">IF&#8230; IF&#8230;</span></strong>) would be yet another sign that despite having done all our particle physics and gravity measurements at much lower energy scales and longer distances, those accessible to the LHC and to our previous experiments, we&#8217;ve actually understood the principles that govern the behavior of phenomena at much, much higher energy scales and much shorter distances!</p>
<p>The energy scale inferred from BICEP2&#8217;s measurement, 100 times smaller than the Planck energy &#8212; 10<sup>16</sup> GeV or so &#8212; has appeared in particle physics before!  If you take the three non-gravitational forces of nature &#8212; <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force and the electromagnetic force</a> &#8212; and you first consider <a title="The Known Particles — If The Higgs Field Were Zero" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/the-known-particles-if-the-higgs-field-were-zero/" target="_blank">how they are rearranged when the Higgs field is turned off, into strong nuclear, weak isospin, and hypercharge forces</a> &#8212; and then you look at <a title="The Strengths of the Known Forces" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-forces-of-nature/the-strength-of-the-known-forces/" target="_blank">how the strengths of the forces drift</a> as you study them at shorter and shorter distances and higher and higher energies, you find the forces all become about the same strength at an energy scale of about 10<sup>16</sup> GeV or so.  This is called &#8220;unification of coupling constants&#8221; (i.e. force strengths) &#8212; or, originally and more ambitiously, &#8220;grand unification&#8221;, a grander notion that the three non-gravitational forces are actually manifestations of just one type of force.  <em>[Unification of that unified force with gravity is yet another question; that&#8217;s what string theory might do, though string theory does not require grand unification be a separate process from the unification with gravity.]</em>  Originally, back around 1980, inflation was imagined to be associated with grand unification, and if so, would have an energy scale of about &#8230; yes, 10<sup>16</sup> GeV or so.  But that idea died out long ago as people learned more about both unification and inflation.  Yet now we must wonder: could that part of the original idea, in some vague way, have actually been right?</p>
<p>Over the years, scientists have invented a plethora of variations on how inflation might have, in detail, taken place.  BICEP2&#8217;s observation of a gravitational wave signature would sweep away most of them, leaving just a few.  (More will be invented in coming months, though!)  It also would sweep away some alternatives to inflation and many speculative ideas for how the universe might behave, or might at least have behaved at earlier times.  Despite &#8220;tension&#8221; (meaning mild disagreement) between BICPS2s current data and the Planck satellite&#8217;s data, a rather simple observable patch of universe, with rather simple laws of nature and a rather simple form of inflation, are consistent with what we know.</p>
<p>One of the variants of inflation that would be excluded by BICEP2&#8217;s data is the notion (admittedly long-shot anyway) that actually the Higgs field could play the role of the inflaton after all.   It turns out that no observably large gravitational wave signal would be expected if that were true.</p>
<p>BICEP2&#8217;s result would represent the first time that, without any theoretical speculation about quantum gravity, an experiment has <strong>forced</strong> us to consider processes involving physics at the Planck scale, where quantum gravity is important.  Specifically, for a variant of inflation to give such a large gravitational wave signal <em>relative</em> to the size of the other non-uniformities in the cosmic microwave background, the Planck energy scale becomes important.  The inflaton field, which (by definition) is the field whose stored &#8220;<a title="The Energy That Holds Things Together" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/the-energy-that-holds-things-together/" target="_blank">potential energy</a>&#8221; <strong>is</strong> the dark energy, must change by an amount close to or a bit larger than the Planck energy scale. <em>[Sorry for the necessary technical-speak here. </em><em>This whole business is inherently confusing for non-experts.  The dark energy <strong>may change or may not change at all</strong> while the inflaton field is changing; that&#8217;s a separate question.  What it means for a field like an inflaton to change by the Planck energy scale is that if a particle interacted with the inflaton field as strongly as it possibly could (the way the electron interacts with the Higgs field, but stronger), then as the inflaton field changed by an amount comparable to the Planck energy scale, the particle&#8217;s mass would change by an amount comparable to the Planck mass.]</em></p>
<p>An extremely simple possibility for inflation that would still be consistent with all the data <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">(IF&#8230; IF&#8230;)</span></strong> is just to have a spin-zero field (a bit like the <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">Higgs field</a>, but with important differences &#8212; no weak nuclear force effects, for instance) which has a mass and no substantial interactions with any other fields.  This is a model introduced by Andrei Linde; it&#8217;s amazingly simple.  Could it really be correct?</p>
<p>Among the other very simple ideas that are likely to feature prominently in discussions of the near future are ones involving a &#8220;pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson&#8221;, of a type often called an &#8220;axion&#8221;.  <em>[I wrote a little about this in the paragraph just below the figure within <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/03/26/cosmic-conflation-the-higgs-the-inflaton-and-spin/" target="_blank">this post about the Planck satellite and what it means for variants of inflation.</a>]</em>  One of the variants of inflation that is most consistent with both the Planck satellite and BICEP2  <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>(IF&#8230; IF&#8230;)</strong></span> is an idea called &#8220;natural inflation&#8221;, from 1990, due to Katherine Freese, Joshua Frieman and Angela Olinto.  [Here&#8217;s a <a href="http://ccdb5fs.kek.jp/cgi-bin/img/allpdf?199010350" target="_blank">pdf of the paper</a>.] Such a field has the feature that it is periodic (i.e., if you change it by enough, it comes back to itself, the way an angle that can only range from 0 to 2π.)  It also has the feature that its interactions with all other fields are rather weak.  When this field varies a lot, the dark energy associated with it varies by quite a bit less&#8230; so the field could vary by something approaching the Planck scale yet the energy scale of the dark energy could stay rather constant, at one percent of the Planck energy.</p>
<p>In order for this idea to really be consistent with quantum gravity, it might require some modification, of the sort was introduced in 2008 by Liam McAllister, Eva Silverstein, and Alexander Westphal, in which the axion is periodic with a larger range than you&#8217;d naively expect.  <em>[They did this work in the context of string theory, but I don&#8217;t believe that string theory specifically is necessary for the idea to work; it might work in other consistent quantum gravity theories, if there are any.]  </em>Expect to hear much more about axions.  [By the way, it&#8217;s long been suggested that dark matter itself could be made from a type of axion&#8230; but presumably not the same one&#8230;]</p>

<p>Colleagues: what have I left out?  Eventually this post will be stored on this site as a reference article, so I&#8217;d like to make it complete.</p>
<p><strong>Final Remarks</strong></p>
<p>One more time I must remind you that we&#8217;re still some time away from trusting the BICEP2 result, and quite a long time from trusting the interpretation of the result in terms of inflation.   All of the implications I&#8217;ve mentioned are therefore provisional.   But the list is impressive, and there are probably more I have forgotten to mention, or are known to others but not to me, along with still others that haven&#8217;t yet been noticed by anyone.  So I don&#8217;t yet know if BICEP2&#8217;s measurement is right, or if inflation occurred and if it created the signal they observe, but I do know this: <strong><em>there&#8217;s a lot at stake</em></strong>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nothing about quantum physics today, but &#8230; wait, <em>everything</em> is made using quantum physics&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Could you imagine getting a dog to sit absolutely still, while fully awake and listening to voices, for as much as 8 minutes? Researchers trained dogs to do it, then put them in an MRI [Magnetic Resonance Imaging] machine to obtain remarkable studies of how dogs&#8217; brains react to human voices and other emotional forms of human expression. [<a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/nuclear/mri.html" target="_blank">MRI is all about</a> magnetic fields, <a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/" target="_blank">protons</a>, spin, and resonance; particle physics!! more on that another time, perhaps.]   The authors claim this is the first study of its type to compare human brains to those of a non-primate species. Here&#8217;s something from <a href="http://www.cell.com/current-biology/retrieve/pii/S0960982214001237" target="_blank">the scientific article&#8217;s abstract</a>:</p>
<p><em>&#8230;</em><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;"><em>We presented dogs and humans with the same set of vocal and non-vocal stimuli to search for functionally analogous voice-sensitive cortical regions. We demonstrate that voice areas exist in dogs and that they show a similar pattern to anterior temporal voice areas in humans. Our findings also reveal that sensitivity to vocal emotional valence cues engages similarly located non-primary auditory regions in dogs and humans&#8230;</em> </span></p>
<p>So it seems, as dog owners have long suspected, that we&#8217;re not just imagining that our best friends are aware of our moods; they really are similar to us in some important ways.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a BBC article: <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-26276660" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-26276660</a></p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;re done with that, would you like to build up your muscles?  No exercise needed, just call the University of Texas at Dallas.  They&#8217;ve found that <em>&#8220;ordinary fishing line and sewing thread can be cheaply converted to powerful artificial muscles.  The new muscles can lift 100 times more weight and generate 100 times higher mechanical power than a human muscle of the same length and weight&#8230; The muscles are powered thermally by temperature changes, which can be produced electrically, by the absorption of light or by the chemical reaction of fuels.&#8221;</em>  [Quantum Physics = cool!!] The quotation above is from <a href="http://www.utdallas.edu/news/2014/2/21-28701_Researchers-Create-Powerful-Muscles-From-Fishing-L_story-wide.html" target="_blank">an interesting press release from the university</a>, reporting the research which was just published in the journal <em>Science</em>.  I recommend the press release because it mentions several interesting possible applications, including robotics technology  and clothing that adjusts to temperature.  Here&#8217;s also a nice article by Anna Kuchment (who&#8217;s on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/akuchment" target="_blank">here</a>):</p>
<p><a href="http://www.utdallas.edu/news/2014/2/21-28701_Researchers-Create-Powerful-Muscles-From-Fishing-L_story-wide.html" target="_blank">http://www.utdallas.edu/news/2014/2/21-28701_Researchers-Create-Powerful-Muscles-From-Fishing-L_story-wide.html</a></p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Though evolution left us with many wonderful abilities, it does seem that, year by year, humans are becoming less and less practically useful.   But at least our dogs will comfort us in our obsolescence.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">In sports, as in science, there are two very different types of heroes.  There are the giants who lead the their teams and their sport, winning championships and accolades, for years, and whose fame lives on for decades: the Michael Jordans, the Peles, the Lou Gherigs, the Joe Montanas. And then there are the unlikely heroes, the ones who just happen to have a really good day at a really opportune time; the substitute player who comes on the field for an injured teammate and scores the winning goal in a championship; the fellow who never hits a home run except on the day it counts; the mediocre receiver who turns a short pass into a long touchdown during the Super Bowl.  We celebrate both types, in awe of the great ones, and in amused pleasure at the inspiring stories of the unlikely ones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">In science we have giants like Newton, Darwin, Boyle, Galileo… The last few decades of particle physics brought us a few, such as Richard Feynman and Ken Wilson, and others we&#8217;ll meet today.  Many of these giants received Nobel Prizes.   But then we have the gentlemen behind what is commonly known as the <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">Higgs particle</a> &#8212; the little ripple in the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">Higgs field</a>, a special field whose presence and properties assure that many of the <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">elementary particles of nature</a> have mass, and without which ordinary matter, and we ourselves, could not exist.  Following <a title="A New Era Dawns" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/07/05/a-new-era-dawns/" target="_blank">discovery of this particle</a> last year, and <a title="From “Higgs-like Particle” to “Standard Model-like Higgs”" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/03/15/from-higgs-like-particle-to-standard-model-like-higgs/" target="_blank">confirmation</a> that it is indeed a Higgs particle, two of them, Francois Englert and Peter Higgs, have been <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2013/" target="_blank">awarded the 2013 Nobel Prize</a> in physics.  Had he lived to see the day, Robert Brout would have been the third.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">The paper written by Brout and Englert; the two papers written by Higgs; the paper written by Gerald Guralnik, Tom Kibble and Carl Hagen; these <em>tiny</em> little documents, a grand total of <em><strong>five and one half printed pages</strong></em> &#8212; these were game-winning singles in the bottom of the 9th, soft goals scored with a minute to play, Hail-Mary passes by backup quarterbacks &#8212; crucial turning-point papers written by people you would not necessarily have expected to find at the center of things.  Brout, Englert, Higgs, Guralnik, Kibble and Hagen are (or rather, in Brout’s case, sadly, were) very fine scientists, intelligent and creative and clever, and their papers, written in 1964 when they were young men, are imperfect but pretty gems.  They were lucky: very smart but not extraordinary physicists who just happened to write the right paper at the right time. In each case, they did so</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#993366;">&#8230;not by studying the real world but by studying <strong><em>simplified, imaginary worlds</em></strong>, in which it was easier to learn the general lessons they wanted to extract&#8230;</span></li>
<li>.<span style="color:#993366;">..with a motivation based on a real-world question &#8212; the origin of mass for <span style="color:#0000ff;"><a title="What’s a Hadron?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-hadron-as-in-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000ff;">hadrons</span></a></span> &#8212; for which, it turns out, their ideas do <em><strong>not</strong></em> apply&#8230;</span> <em> [Hadrons, including <a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/" target="_blank">protons and neutrons</a>, are <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part 4)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/07/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-4/">today known to be particles made from quarks and gluons</a>; but that wasn&#8217;t known in the early 1960s.]</em></li>
<li><span style="color:#993366;">&#8230;and with no suspicion that their results would instead be applied to a different real-world question: the possibility that the <span style="color:#0000ff;"><a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000ff;">weak nuclear force is associated with photon-like particles, called W and Z</span></a>,</span> that have a mass.</span> <em>[A photon is a particle of light, has spin=1, and, unlike the W and Z particles, has no mass.]</em></li>
</ul>
<p>History in general, and history of science in particular, is always vastly more complex than the simple stories we tell ourselves and our descendants.  Making history understandable in a few pages always requires erasing complexities and subtleties that are crucial for making sense of the past.  Today, all across the press, there are articles explaining incorrectly what Higgs and the others did and why they did it and what it meant at the time and what it means now.  I am afraid I have a few over-simplified articles of my own. But today I&#8217;d like to give you a little sense of the complexities, to the extent that I, who wasn’t even alive at the time, can understand them.  And also, I want to convey a few important lessons that I think the Hi(gg)story can teach both experts and non-experts.  Here are a couple to think about as you read:</p>
<p><span style="color:#339966;">1. It is important for theoretical physicists, and others who make mathematical equations that might describe the world, to study and learn from <em>imaginary</em> worlds, especially <em>simple</em> ones.  That is because</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#339966;">1a. one can often infer general lessons more easily from simple worlds than from the (often more complicated) real one, and</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#339966;">1b. sometimes an aspect of an imaginary world will turn out to be more real than you expected!</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#339966;">2. One must not assume that research motivated by a particular goal depends upon the achievement of that goal; even if the original goal proves illusory, the results of the research may prove useful or even essential in a completely different arena.</span></p>
<p>My summary today is based on a reading of the papers themselves, on comments by John Iliopoulos, and on a conversation with Englert, and on reading and hearing <a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/nms/depts/physics/news/events/MyLifeasaBoson.pdf" target="_blank">Higgs&#8217; own description of the episode</a>.</p>
<p>The story is incompletely but perhaps usefully illustrated in the figure below, which shows a cartoon of how four important scientific stories of the late 1950s and early 1960s came together. They are:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color:#ff0000;">How do superconductors (materials that carry electricity without generating heat) really work?</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#ff0000;">How does the <span style="color:#3366ff;"><a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#3366ff;">proton</span></a></span> get its mass, and why are <span style="color:#3366ff;"><a title="What’s a Hadron?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-hadron-as-in-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#3366ff;">pions</span></a></span> (the lightest hadrons) so much lighter than protons?</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#ff0000;">Why do <span style="color:#3366ff;"><a title="What’s a Hadron?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-hadron-as-in-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#3366ff;">hadrons</span></a></span> behave the way they do; specifically, as suggested by J.J. Sakurai</span> <em>(who died rather young, and after whom <a title="Some Pre-Nobel Prizes" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/03/some-pre-nobel-prizes/" target="_blank">a famous prize is named</a>)</em>, <span style="color:#ff0000;">why are there photon-like hadrons, called <span style="color:#3366ff;"><a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part 4)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/07/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-4/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#3366ff;">rho mesons</span></a></span>, that have mass?</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#ff0000;">How does the weak nuclear force work?  Specifically, as suggested by Schwinger and developed further by his student Glashow, might it involve photon-like particles (now called W and Z) with mass?</span></li>

<p>These four questions converged on a question of principle: “how can mass be given to particles?”, and the first, third and fourth were all related to the specific question of &#8220;how can mass be given to <em>photon-like</em> particles?’’  This is where the story really begins.  [Almost everyone in the story is a giant with a Nobel Prize, indicated with a parenthetic (NPyear).]</p>

<p>In 1962, Philip Anderson (NP1977), an expert on (among other things) superconductors, responded to suggestions and questions of Julian Schwinger (NP1965) on the topic of photon-like particles with mass, pointing out that <strong>a photon actually gets a mass inside a superconductor</strong>, due to what we today would identify as a sort of &#8220;Higgs-type’’ field made from pairs of electrons.  And he speculated, without showing it mathematically, that very similar ideas could apply to empty space, where Einstein’s relativity principles hold true, and that this could allow elementary photon-like particles in empty space to have mass, if in fact there were a kind of Higgs-type field in empty space.</p>
<p>In all its essential elements, he had the right idea.  But since he didn’t put math behind his speculation, not everyone believed him.  In fact, in 1964 Walter Gilbert (NP1980 for <em>chemistry</em>, due to work relevant in molecular <em>biology</em> &#8212; how’s that for a twist?) even gave a proof that Anderson’s idea couldn’t work in empty space!</p>
<p>But Higgs immediately responded, arguing that Gilbert’s proof had an important loophole, and that photon-like particles <strong><em>could</em></strong> indeed get a mass in empty space.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, about a month <strong><em>earlier</em></strong> than Higgs, and not specifically responding to Anderson and Gilbert, Brout and Englert wrote a paper showing how to get mass for photon-like particles in empty space. They showed this in several types of imaginary worlds, using techniques that were different from Higgs&#8217; and were correct though perhaps not entirely complete.</p>
<p>A second paper by Higgs, written before he was aware of Brout and Englert&#8217;s work, gave a simple example, again in an imaginary world, that made all of this much easier to understand&#8230; though his example wasn&#8217;t perhaps entirely convincing, because he didn&#8217;t show much detail.  His paper was followed by important theoretical clarifications from Guralnik, Hagen and Kibble that assured that the Brout-Englert and Higgs papers were actually right.  The combination of these papers settled the issue, from our modern perspective.</p>
<p>And in the middle of this, as an afterthought added to his second paper only after it was rejected by a journal, Higgs was the first person to mention something that was, for him and the others, almost beside the point &#8212; that in the Anderson-Brout-Englert-Higgs-Guralnik-Hagen-Kibble story for how photon-like particles get a mass, there will also  generally be a spin-zero particle with a mass: a ripple in the Higgs-type field, which today we call a Higgs-type particle.  Not that he said very much!   He noted that spin-one (i.e. photon-like) and spin-zero particles would come in unusual combinations.  (You have to be an expert to even figure out why that counts as predicting a Higgs-type particle!)  Also he wrote the equation that describes how and why the Higgs-type particle arises, and noted how to calculate the particle’s mass from other quantities.  But that was it.  There was nothing about how the particle would behave, or how to discover it in the imaginary worlds that he was considering;  direct application to experiment, even in an imaginary world, wasn’t his priority in these papers.</p>

<p>About the &#8220;Higgs-type&#8221; particle, Anderson says nothing; Brout and Englert say nothing; Guralnik et al. say something very brief that’s irrelevant in any imaginable real-world application.  Why the silence?  Perhaps because it was too obvious to be worth mentioning?  When what you’re doing is pointing out something really &#8220;important’’ &#8212; that photon-like particles can have a mass after all &#8212; the spin-zero particle’s existence is so obvious but so irrelevant to your goal that it hardly deserves comment.  And that’s indeed why Higgs added it only as an afterthought, to make the paper a bit less abstract and a bit easier for  a journal to publish.  None of them could have imagined <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-18702455" target="_blank">the hoopla and public excitement that, five decades later, would surround the attempt to discover a particle of this type</a>, whose specific form in the real world none of them wrote down.</p>
<p>In the minds of these authors, any near-term application of their ideas would probably be to hadrons, perhaps specifically Sakurai’s theory of hadrons, which in 1960 predicted the &#8220;rho mesons&#8221;, which are photon-like hadrons with mass, and had been discovered in 1961.  Anderson, Brout-Englert and Higgs specifically mention hadrons at certain moments. But none of them actually considered the real hadrons of nature, as they were just trying to make points of principle; and in any case, the ideas that they developed did not apply to hadrons at all.  <em>(Well, actually, that&#8217;s not quite true, but the connection is too roundabout to discuss here.)</em>  Sakurai&#8217;s ideas had an element of truth, but fundamentally led to a dead end.  <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part 4)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/07/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-4/" target="_blank">The rho mesons get their mass in another way.</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, none of these people wrote down anything resembling the Higgs field which we know <em>today</em> &#8212; the one that is crucial for our very existence &#8212; so they certainly didn&#8217;t directly predict <a title="A New Era Dawns" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/07/05/a-new-era-dawns/" target="_blank">the Higgs particle that was discovered in 2012</a>.   It was Steven Weinberg (NP1979) in 1967, and Abdus Salam (NP1979) in 1968, who did that.  (And it was Weinberg who stuck Higgs&#8217; name on the field and particle, so that everyone else was forgotten.) These giants combined</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#008000;">the ideas of Higgs and the others about how to give mass to photon-like particles using a Higgs-type field, with its Higgs-type particle as a consequence&#8230;</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#008000;">&#8230;with the 1960 work of Sheldon Glashow (NP1979), Schwinger’s student, who like Schwinger proposed the weak nuclear force was due to photon-like particles with mass,&#8230;</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#008000;">&#8230;and with the 1960-1961 work of Murray Gell-Man (NP1969) and Maurice Levy and of Yoichiro Nambu (NP2008) and Giovanni Jona-Lasinio, who showed how proton-like or electron-like particles could get mass from what we&#8217;d now call Higgs-type fields.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>This combination gave the first modern quantum field theory of particle physics: a set of equations that describe the weak nuclear and electromagnetic forces, and show <a title="How the Higgs Field Works (with math)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/how-the-higgs-field-works-with-math/" target="_blank">how the Higgs field can give the W and Z particles and the electron their masses</a>. It is the primitive core of what today we call <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the Standard Model of particle physics</a>.  Not that anyone took this theory seriously, even Weinberg.  Most people thought <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part 3)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/01/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-3/" target="_blank">quantum field theories of this type</a> were mathematically inconsistent &#8212; until in 1971 Gerard ‘t Hooft (NP1999) proved they were consistent after all.</p>
<p>The Hi(gg)story is populated with giants.  I&#8217;m afraid my attempt to tell the story has giant holes to match.  But as far as the Higgs particle that was discovered last year at the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a>, the unlikely heroes of the story are the relatively ordinary scientists who slipped in between the giants and actually scored the goals.</p>

<p>We particle physicists are extremely fortunate that this particular quantum field theory is just one step more complicated than the very simplest quantum field theories. If this hadn&#8217;t been the case, we might still be trying to figure out how it works, and we wouldn&#8217;t be able to make detailed and precise predictions for how the known elementary particles will behave in our experiments, such as those at the <a title="Introduction to the&nbsp;LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC].</p>
<p>In order to make predictions for processes that we can measure at the LHC, using the equations of the Standard Model, we employ a method of<em> successive approximation</em> (with the jargon name &#8220;method of perturbations&#8221;, or &#8220;perturbation `theory&#8217; &#8221;). It&#8217;s a very common method in math and science, in which</p>
<ul>
<li>we make an initial rough estimate,</li>
<li>and then correct the estimate,</li>
<li>and then correct the correction,</li>
<li>etc.,</li>
</ul>
<p>until we have a prediction that is precise enough for our needs.</p>
<p>What are those needs? Well, the precision of any measurement, in any context, is always limited by having</p>
<ul>
<li>a finite amount of data (so small statistical flukes are common)</li>
<li>imperfect equipment (so small mistakes are inevitable).</li>
</ul>
<p>What we need, for each measurement, is a prediction a little more precise than the measurement will be, but not much more so. In the difficult environment of the LHC, where measurements are really hard, we often need only the first correction to the original estimate; sometimes we need the second (see Figure 2).</p>

<p>Until recently the calculations were done by starting with Feynman&#8217;s famous diagrams, but the diagrams are not as efficient as one would like, and <a title="From String Theory to the Large Hadron&nbsp;Collider" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/08/15/from-string-theory-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">new techniques</a> have made them mostly obsolete for really hard calculations.</p>
<p>The method of successive approximation works as long <em>as all the forces involved are rather &#8220;weak&#8221;</em>, in a technical sense. Now this notion of &#8220;weak&#8221; is complicated enough (and important enough) that <a title="The Strengths of the Known&nbsp;Forces" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-forces-of-nature/the-strength-of-the-known-forces/" target="_blank">I wrote a whole article on it</a>, so those who really want to understand this should read that article. The brief summary suitable for today is this: suppose you took two particles that are attracted to each other by a force, and allowed them to glom together, <a title="Atoms: Their Inner&nbsp;Workings" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/atoms-building-blocks-of-molecules/atoms-their-inner-workings/" target="_blank">like an electron and a proton</a>, to form an atom-like object. &nbsp;Then <em>if the relative velocity of the two particles is small compared to the speed of light, the force is weak</em>. The stronger the force, the faster the particles will move around inside their &#8220;atom&#8221;. &nbsp;(For more details see&nbsp;<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-forces-of-nature/the-strength-of-the-known-forces/">this article</a>.&nbsp;)</p>
<p>For a weak force, the method of successive approximation is very useful, because the correction to the initial estimate is small, and <span style="color:#808080;">the correction to the correction is smaller</span>, and <span style="color:#999999;">the correction to the correction to the correction is even smaller</span>. So for a weak force, the first or second correction is usually enough; one doesn&#8217;t have to calculate forever in order to get a sufficiently precise prediction. The &#8220;stronger&#8221; the force, in this technical sense, the harder you have to work to get a precise prediction, because the corrections to your estimate are larger.</p>
<p>If a force is truly strong, though, everything breaks down. In that case, the correction to the estimate is as big as the estimate, and the next correction is again just as big, so no method of successive approximation will get you close to the answer. In short, <em>for truly strong forces,</em> <em><strong>you need a completely different approach</strong></em> if you are to make predictions.</p>
<p>In the Standard Model, the electromagnetic force and the weak nuclear force are &#8220;weak&#8221; in all contexts. However, the strong nuclear force is (technically) &#8220;strong&#8221; for any processes that involve distances comparable to or larger than a <a title="What’s a Proton,&nbsp;Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/" target="_blank">proton</a>&#8216;s size (about 100,000 times smaller than an <a title="Atoms: Building Blocks of&nbsp;Molecules" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/atoms-building-blocks-of-molecules/" target="_blank">atom</a>) or energies comparable to or smaller than a proton&#8217;s mass-energy (about 1 <a title="GeV and&nbsp;TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/" target="_blank">GeV</a>). For such processes, successive approximation does not work at all; it can&#8217;t be used to calculate a proton&#8217;s size or mass or internal structure. In fact <em>the first step in that method would estimate that quarks and anti-quarks and gluons are free to roam independently and the proton should not exist at all</em>&#8230; which is so obviously completely wrong that no method of correcting it will ever give the right answer. &nbsp;I&#8217;ll get back to how we show protons are predicted by these equations, using big computers, in a later post.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s a remarkable fact about the strong nuclear force. As I said, at distances the size of a proton or larger, the strong nuclear force is so strong that successive approximation doesn&#8217;t work. Yet, at distances shorter than this, <strong>the force actually becomes &#8220;weak&#8221;</strong>, <em>in the technical sense</em>, and successive approximation <em>does</em> work there.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">Let me make sure this is absolutely clear, because the difference between what we think of colloquially as &#8220;weak&#8221; is different from &#8220;weak&#8221; in the sense I&#8217;m using it here. &nbsp;Suppose you put two quarks very close together, at a distance r closer together than the radius R of a proton. &nbsp;In Figure 3 I&#8217;ve plotted how big the strong nuclear force (purple) and the electromagnetic force (blue) would be between two quarks, as a function of the distance between them. Notice both forces are very strong (colloquially) at short distances (r &lt;&lt; R), but (I assert) both forces are weak (technically) there. &nbsp;The electromagnetic force is much the weaker of the two, which is why its curve is lower in the plot. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">Now if you move the two quarks apart a bit (increasing r, but still with r &lt;&lt; R), both forces become smaller; in fact both decrease almost like 1/r², which would be your first, naive estimate, same as in your high school science class. If this naive estimate were correct, both forces would maintain the same strength (technically) at all distances r. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">But this isn&#8217;t quite right. &nbsp;Since the 1950s, it was well-known that the correction to this estimate (using successive approximation methods) is to make the electromagnetic force decrease <em>just a little faster</em> than that; it becomes a tiny bit weaker (technically) at longer distances. &nbsp;In the 60s, that&#8217;s what most people thought any force described by quantum field theory would do. But they were wrong. &nbsp;In 1973, David Politzer, and David Gross and Frank Wilczek, showed that&nbsp;<strong><em>for the quantum field theory of quarks and gluons, the correction to the naive estimate goes the other direction</em></strong>; it makes the force decrease just a little more <em><strong>slowly</strong></em> than 1/r². <em>[Gerard &#8216;t Hooft had also calculated this, but apparently without fully recognizing its importance&#8230;?]</em> It is the small, accumulating excess above the naive estimate &#8212; the gradual deviation of the purple curve from its naive 1/r² form &#8212; that leads us to say that this force becomes technically &#8220;stronger&#8221; and &#8220;stronger&#8221; at larger distances. Once the distance r becomes comparable to a proton&#8217;s size R, the force becomes so &#8220;strong&#8221; that successive approximation methods fail. &nbsp;As shown in the figure, we have some evidence that the force becomes constant for r &gt;&gt; R, independent of distance. &nbsp;It is this effect that, as we&#8217;ll see next time, is responsible for the existence of <a title="The Nuclei of Atoms: At the Heart of&nbsp;Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-nuclei-of-atoms-at-the-heart-of-matter/" target="_blank">protons and neutrons</a>, and therefore of all ordinary matter.</span></p>

<p>So:&nbsp;<em>at very short distances and high energies, the strong nuclear force is a somewhat &#8220;weak&#8221; force</em>, stronger still than the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces, but similar to them. &nbsp;And therefore,&nbsp;<span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">successive approximation <strong>can</strong> tell you what happens when a quark inside one speeding proton hits a quark in a proton speeding the other direction, as long as the quarks collide with energy far more than 1 GeV. <em><strong>If this weren&#8217;t true, we could make scarcely any predictions at the LHC, and at similar proton-proton and proton-antiproton colliders!</strong></em>&nbsp;(We do also need to know about the proton&#8217;s structure, but we don&#8217;t calculate that: we simply measure it in other experiments.) &nbsp;In particular, we would never have been able to calculate how often we should be making top quarks, as in Figure 2. &nbsp;And we would not have been able to calculate what the Standard Model, or any other quantum field theory, predicts for the rate at which <a title="Production of the Standard Model Higgs&nbsp;Particle" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/production-of-the-standard-model-higgs-particle/" target="_blank">Higgs particles are produced</a>, so we&#8217;d never have been sure that the LHC would either find or exclude the Standard Model Higgs particle. Fortunately, it <em>is</em> true, and that is why precise predictions can be made, for so many processes, at the LHC. &nbsp;And the success of those and other predictions underlies our confidence that the Standard Model correctly describes most of what we know about particle physics.</span></p>
<p>But still, the equations of the strong nuclear force have only quarks and anti-quarks and gluons in them &#8212; no protons, neutrons, or other hadrons. &nbsp;Our understanding of the real world would certainly be incomplete if we didn&#8217;t know why there are protons. &nbsp;Well, it turns out that <em><strong>if we want to know whether protons and neutrons and other hadrons are actually predicted by the strong nuclear force&#8217;s equations, we have to test this notion using big computers</strong></em>. And that&#8217;s tricky, even trickier than you might guess.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Done: All three parts of my lecture for a general audience on String Theory are up now&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Beyond the Hype: The Weird World of String Theory </strong>(Science on Tap, Seattle, WA, September 25, 2006). Though a few years old, this talk is still very topical; it covers the history, development, context and impact of string theory from its earliest beginnings to the (then) present.</p>
<p><em>Be forewarned: although the audio is pretty good, this was an amateur video taken by one of the organizers of the talk, and because the place was small and totally packed with people, it&#8217;s not great quality&#8230; but good enough to follow, I think, so I&#8217;ve posted it.</em></p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://youtu.be/yEkqcQH4zgA" target="_blank">Part 1</a> (10 mins.): String theory&#8217;s beginnings in <a title="What’s a Hadron?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-hadron-as-in-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">hadron</a> physics and the early attempts to use it as a theory of quantum gravity.</li>
<li><a href="http://youtu.be/LYwqCcFS508" target="_blank">Part 2</a> (10 mins.): String theory was shown to be a mathematically consistent candidate for a theory of all of quantum gravity and particle physics, and became a really popular idea.</li>
<li><a href="http://youtu.be/Bhi721-63l4" target="_blank">Part 3</a> (9 mins.): How string theory evolved through the major technical and conceptual advances of the 1990s.</li>
</ol>
<p>By the way, if you&#8217;re interested in other talks I&#8217;ve given for a general audience, you can check out <a title="Movie Clips" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/videoclips/" target="_blank">my video clip</a>s, which include a recent hour-long talk on the Quest for the Higgs Boson.</p>

<p>As I&#8217;ve described in <a title="Protons and Neutrons: The Massive Pandemonium of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/protons-and-neutrons/" target="_blank">my new article</a>, along the lines of <a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/" target="_blank">this short article</a> and <a title="Checking What’s Inside a Proton" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/checking-whats-inside-a-proton/" target="_blank">this more detailed one</a> that I wrote some time ago in the context of the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a>, the story that scientists tell the public most often, that &#8220;a proton is made from two up quarks and a down quark&#8221;, is not in fact the full story &#8212; and in some ways it is deeply misleading.  The structure of protons and neutrons is so entirely unfamiliar, and so complicated, that scientists neither have a simple way of calculating it, nor an entirely agreed-upon way to describe it to the public, or even to physics students.  But I believe my way of describing it will be satisfactory to most particle physicists.</p>
<p><a title="Protons and Neutrons: The Massive Pandemonium of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/protons-and-neutrons/" target="_blank">The new article</a> is not entirely complete; it is perhaps only half its final length.  I&#8217;ll be adding some further sections that cover some subtle issues.  But since I suspect many people won&#8217;t feel the need to read those later sections, the completed part is written to stand on its own.  If you like, take a look and let me know if you have questions, suggestions or corrections.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Posts have been notably absent, due mainly to travel with very limited internet; apologies for the related lack of replies to comments, which I hope to correct later this week.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I&#8217;ve been working on a couple of articles related to the nuclei of atoms, part of my <a title="The Structure of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/" target="_blank">Structure of Matter series,</a> which serves to introduce non-experts to <a title="Particle Physics Basics" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/" target="_blank">the basics of particle physics.</a>  The <a title="The Nuclei of Atoms: At the Heart of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-nuclei-of-atoms-at-the-heart-of-matter/" target="_blank">first of these articles</a> is done.  In it I describe why it was so easy (relatively speaking) to figure out that nuclei are made from certain numbers of protons and neutrons, and how it was understood that nuclei are very small compared to atoms.   Comments welcome as always!</p>
<p>A related article, which should appear later this week, will clarify why nuclei are so tiny relative to atoms, and describe the force of nature that keeps them intact.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s been a lot of reporting recently on a puzzle in particle physics that I haven&#8217;t previously written about. There have been two attempts, a preliminary one in 2010 and <a href="http://www.psi.ch/media/proton-size-puzzle-reinforced" target="_blank">a more detailed one reported just this month</a>, to measure the size of a proton by studying the properties of an exotic atom, called &#8220;muonic hydrogen&#8221;. Similar to <a title="Atoms: Building Blocks of Molecules" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/atoms-building-blocks-of-molecules/" target="_blank">hydrogen</a>, which consists of a proton orbited by an <a title="Electrons: On the Outskirts of Atoms" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/electrons-on-the-outskirts-of-atoms/" target="_blank">electron</a> (Figure 1), this atom consists of a <a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/" target="_blank">proton</a> and a short-lived heavy cousin of the electron, called the <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">muon</a> (Figure 2). A muon, as far as we have ever been able to tell, is just like an electron in all respects except that it is heavier; more precisely, <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the electromagnetic force and the strong and weak nuclear force</a> treat electrons and muons in exactly the same way. Only the first two of these forces should play a role in atoms (and neither gravity nor any force due to the <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">Higgs field</a> should matter either). So because we have confirmed our understanding of ordinary hydrogen with very high precision, we believe we also understand muonic hydrogen very well also.  But something&#8217;s amiss.<span id="more-5502"></span></p>

The forces holding the atom together are the same, but the larger mass of the muon makes the atom smaller, and more sensitive to the (still relatively tiny) size of the proton.</p></div>
<p>Since the muon is about 200 times heavier than the electron, muonic hydrogen is about 200 times smaller (across) than ordinary hydrogen.  <em>[For an argument as to why, see the end of <a title="Atoms: Their Inner Workings" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/atoms-building-blocks-of-molecules/atoms-their-inner-workings/" target="_blank">this article</a>.]</em> And so the proton, which has a diameter about 60,000 times smaller than ordinary hydrogen, is only <strong>300</strong> times smaller than muonic hydrogen. That makes the details of muonic hydrogen more sensitive to the proton&#8217;s size, and thus allows for a more precise measurement.<br />
<em> </em></p>
<p>How is this done? On the experimental side, the experimenters use a laser whose energy per photon can be adjusted, and they measure the energy of photons needed to make muonic hydrogen transition from one state to another (similar to what is shown in Figure 3).<em> [In quantum mechanics, atoms and other similar systems can only exist in very particular states, each one with a very particular mass, shape, size, and other properties.]</em> Only photons of precisely the right energy will do the job for a particular transition. On the theoretical side, one uses known properties of protons, muons, and electromagnetic forces, etc., and (treating the proton&#8217;s size as completely unknown) one calculates carefully what the energy of the required laser photons is expected to be.  The answer depends on the proton&#8217;s unknown size, so by requiring the calculation agrees with the measurement, one learns what the proton&#8217;s size is! Or rather, one learns this <em>as long as one assumes</em></p>
<ul>
<li>the measurement was done accurately,</li>
<li>the calculation contains no errors,</li>
<li>and no important effects were left out of the calculation.</li>
</ul>

(The state of lowest energy is called the &#8220;ground&#8221; state; all others are called &#8220;excited states.)  The same technique works for a muonic atom. Specific transitions (not shown) have been used in the case of muonic hydrogen, while many different transitions have been used for ordinary hydrogen.</p></div>
<p>The reason for the recent excitement is that a similar technique for measuring the proton&#8217;s size has been used many times for transitions between states of ordinary hydrogen, and <strong><em>it gives a different answer</em></strong>. It is far less precise, but has been done many different ways, so the average of all the different measurements is estimated to be only 10 times less precise than the new measurements in muonic hydrogen. The value for the proton&#8217;s size obtained from ordinary hydrogen is <strong>about 4% larger</strong> than obtained from muonic hydrogen.  This is illustrated in Figure 4, which is taken from <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1301.0905" target="_blank">a recent useful review article on the subject by Pohl, Gilman, Miller and Pachucki.</a> <em>[Note I have abridged their caption.] </em> More specifically, the measurements based on transitions between states of ordinary hydrogen give an average proton radius of about 0.88 fermi <em>(where a &#8220;fermi&#8221; = femtometer is a quadrillionth of a meter = a thousandth of a millionth of a millionth of a meter = 10</em><sup>-15</sup><em> meters &#8212; and a meter is about 39 inches.</em>) The uncertainty on this result is claimed to be 0.01 fermi.  The measurements based on muonic hydrogen transitions give an answer of 0.84 fermi, with a much smaller uncertainty.  Precise numbers (valid before the recent improved muon-based result) are given in Figure 4.<em><br />

<p>Meanwhile, there&#8217;s another strategy for measuring the proton&#8217;s size, using high-energy electrons which fly into hydrogen gas and occasionally scatter off the protons deep within the hydrogen atoms (Figure 5.) By looking at the pattern of energies and directions of the scattered electrons, physicists can infer the size of the proton. And the answer they obtain, though again not as precise as obtained from <em>muonic</em> hydrogen, is about as precise and gives about the same answer as that obtained from transitions between states of <em>ordinary</em> hydrogen: 0.88 fermi.  This is illustrated in Figure 6, taken from <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1301.0905" target="_blank">the same recent review article.</a></p>

The energy of the electrons is chosen low enough that the proton is not itself greatly distorted or shattered. By studying the probability of and the pattern of scattering, scientists can determine the size of the proton.</p></div>
<p>This is not a dramatic difference &#8212; it represents only a 4% discrepancy. But the previous measurements of the proton radius were believed to be precise to about 0.9% (for a single standard deviation.) So the new measurements differ from the average of the old ones by a relatively large amount, which the authors state is about 7 standard deviations<em> [though how this number was obtained is obscure to me currently.  Presumably it is explained clearly in <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/339/6118/417" target="_blank">the published paper</a>, which is in Science Magazine.  I will try to clarify this point later today if I can.]</em></p>
<p>Well, 7 standard deviations (or &#8220;sigmas&#8221;) is far more than the 3 to 5 standard deviations that are typically considered impressive. However, one should remember that statistically significant results simply imply discovery of either (a) something about nature or (b) a human error&#8230; with the latter always more likely. The famous <a title="This Time, ICARUS Really DOES Refute OPERA" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/16/this-time-icarus-really-does-refute-opera/" target="_blank">faster-than-light neutrinos disagreed with Einstein&#8217;s prediction by 6 standard deviations</a>, and all that meant was that someone made a mistake.</p>

A variety of measurements (and reanalyses thereof) of the proton radius, by year.  Most of them were made in hydrogen state transitions and in electron-proton scattering experiments.  Almost all recent non-muonic measurements are somewhat above the muonic hydrogen measurement, which lies near the words &#8220;muonic hydrogen&#8221; and is much more precise than all previous measurements.  The most recent muonic hydrogen measurement is not shown, but is consistent with and even more precise than the one shown.</p></div>
<p>Now the most exciting and revolutionary explanation (but, in my current view, very unlikely) for this disagreement would be a new force or other new phenomenon that affects muons and not electrons (or affects exotic small atoms more strongly than ones of ordinary size.) Its presence would foul up the proton size measurement by changing muonic hydrogen slightly, in a way that is not accounted for in the theory calculation that is needed for extracting the proton&#8217;s size.</p>
<p><span style="color:#993366;">[Note Added: It is extremely unlikely indeed that there could be an unknown force powerful enough to <strong>actually</strong> change the proton&#8217;s size!  Such a force would have to counter the strong nuclear force that sets the size of the proton, and anything so large would have been observed decades ago, in other experiments.  No; instead, what is most plausible is a wimpy force whose small effects subtly change the relationship between the <em>measurement</em> and the <em>calculation that is done to <strong>infer</strong> the proton&#8217;s size</em> from that measurement.  Then the proton has only one size, but the size wasn&#8217;t properly extracted from one of the measurements because a small effect was left out.]<br />

<p>But a number of my colleagues have shown, in various ways, that to introduce a new force that would affect muonic hydrogen by this amount, and not muck up previous measurements of the properties of muons or electrons or protons or neutrons, and not show up in the decays of other well-studied particles, is extremely difficult; it requires arranging multiple cancellations between multiple effects, at a level that is highly unpalatable. Maybe I&#8217;ll write about this at a later time, but I warn you that you won&#8217;t like what you see.  You can find relevant references in section 4.5 of the Pohl et al. review.</p>
<p>On top of this difficulty, the discrepancy is not (in my personal view) as crisp as it looks at first glance. The calculations required to extract the proton&#8217;s size are very complicated indeed, and have many ingredients and steps; the measurements are not very sensitive to the proton&#8217;s size, so highly precise measurements and a heck of a lot of theoretical processing are both needed before one can extract the desired information. (In the Pohl et al. review, the authors, merely to summarize the various calculations that are needed and have been performed, require well over a dozen densely written and highly technical pages.) At certain stages along the way, experts might perhaps have been a bit 0verly optimistic about how well their methods work, and if so, perhaps the resulting theoretical uncertainty in one of the proton&#8217;s size measurements is underestimated. Given the complexities and subtleties, which lie outside my expertise, the best I can do is warn you that the Pohl et al. review does point out some potential concerns. Here&#8217;s a quotation: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">To summarize, the apparently simple problem of determining the slope of the form factor at Q<sup>2</sup> = 0 <em>[which is needed to extract the proton radius from electron-proton scattering]</em> has numerous potential pitfalls. The weight of the evidence at this point continues to favor a larger radius, about 0.88 fm, but suggests that claiming an uncertainty at the 0.01 fm level is optimistic</span>.&#8221; This is not the only issue where questions are raised, though without firm conclusions.  It does mean one should remain cautious.  A discrepancy of 7 standard deviations sounds like a lot; but if you underestimated an important source of systematic uncertainties by a factor of 2 or 3, your 7 standard deviations could drop to an unimpressive 3.5 or 2 in a big hurry. So a very careful reconsideration of the uncertainties is necessary.</p>
<p>Fortunately many additional related measurements (discussed in section 5 of the Pohl et al. review) are being planned, and collectively these should help clarify and perhaps resolve this puzzle. Meanwhile the relevant theorists are clearly working hard to check previous calculations and assure that the limitations on their methods are properly accounted for.</p>
<p>At this point I am not optimistic that this discrepancy has a profound origin. But hey &#8212; you never really know for certain until the situation is satisfactorily settled &#8212; so we&#8217;ll need to keep a close eye on this puzzle as it evolves.  There&#8217;s a very low but non-zero probability that it is of great importance. And if it is, I personally doubt anyone has yet thought of the reason.</p>
