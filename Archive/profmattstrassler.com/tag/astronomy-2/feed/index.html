										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>[Note added April 16: some minor improvements have been made to this article as my understanding has increased, specifically concerning the photon-sphere, which is the main region from which the radio waves are seen in the recently released image. See later blog posts for the image and its interpretation.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Note added June 14: significant misconceptions concerning the photon-sphere and shadow, as relevant to the black hole &#8216;photo&#8217;, dominated reporting in April, and I myself was also subject to them.  <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/06/14/a-ring-of-controversy-around-a-black-hole-photo">I have explained the origin of and correction to these misconceptions, which affect the interpretation of the image, in my post &#8220;A Ring of Controversy&#8221;.</a>]</em></p>
<p>About fifteen years ago, when I was a professor at the University of Washington, the particle physics theorists and the astronomer theorists occasionally would arrange to have lunch together, to facilitate an informal exchange of information about our adjacent fields. Among the many enjoyable discussions, one I was particularly excited about &#8212; as much as an amateur as a professional &#8212; was that in which I learned of the plan to make some sort of image of a black hole. I was told that this incredible feat would likely be achieved by 2020. <a href="https://eventhorizontelescope.org/blog/media-advisory-first-results-event-horizon-telescope-be-presented-april-10th">The time, it seems, has arrived.</a></p>
<p>The goal of this post is to provide readers with what I hope will be a helpful guide through the foggy swamp that is likely to partly obscure this major scientific result. Over the last days I&#8217;ve been reading what both scientists and science journalists are writing in advance of the press conference Wednesday morning, and I&#8217;m finding many examples of jargon masquerading as English, terms poorly defined, and phrasing that seems likely to mislead. As I&#8217;m increasingly concerned that many non-experts will be unable to understand what is presented tomorrow, and what the pictures do and do not mean, I&#8217;m using this post to answer a few questions that many readers (and many of these writers) have perhaps not thought to ask.<span id="more-10241"></span></p>
<p>A caution: I am not an expert on this subject. At the moment, I&#8217;m still learning about the more subtle issues. I&#8217;ll try to be clear about when I&#8217;m on the edge of my knowledge, and hopefully won&#8217;t make any blunders <em>[but experts, please point them out if you see any!]</em></p>
<p><strong>Which black holes are being imaged?</strong></p>
<p>The initial plan behind the so-called &#8220;Event Horizon Telescope&#8221; <em>(the name deserves some discussion; see below)</em> has been to make images of two black holes at the centers of galaxies (the star-cities in which most stars are found.) These are not black holes formed by the collapse of individual stars, such as the ones whose collisions have been <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2016/02/11/advance-thoughts-on-ligo/">observed through their gravitational waves</a>. <em><strong>Central galactic black holes are millions or even billions of times larger!</strong></em>  The ones being observed are</p>
<ol>
<li>the large and `close&#8217; black hole at the center of the Milky Way (the giant star-city we call home), and</li>
<li>the immense but much more distant back hole at the center of M87 (a spectacularly big star-megalopolis.)</li>
</ol>

<p>Why go after both of these black holes at the same time? Just as the Sun and Moon appear the same size in our sky because of an accident &#8212; the Sun&#8217;s greater distance is almost precisely compensated by its greater size &#8212; these two black holes appear similarly sized, albeit very tiny, from our vantage point.</p>
<p>Our galaxy&#8217;s central black hole has a mass of about four million Suns, and its size is about twenty times wider than our Sun (in contrast to the black holes whose gravitational waves were observed, which are the size of a human city.) But from the center of our galaxy, it takes light tens of thousands of years to reach Earth, and at such a great distance, this big black hole appears as small as would a tiny grain of sand from a plane at cruising altitude. Try to see the sand grains on a beach from a plane window!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, although M87 lies about two thousand times further away, its central black hole has a mass and radius about two thousand times larger than our galaxy&#8217;s black hole. Consequently it appears roughly the same size on the sky.</p>
<p>We may get our first images of both black holes at Wednesday&#8217;s announcement, though it is possible that so far only one image is ready for public presentation.</p>
<p><strong>How can one see something as black as a black hole?!?</strong></p>
<p>First of all, aren&#8217;t black holes black? Doesn&#8217;t that mean they don&#8217;t emit (or reflect) any light? Yes, and yes. <em>[With a caveat &#8212; Hawking radiation &#8212; but while that&#8217;s very important for extremely small black holes, it&#8217;s completely irrelevant for these ones.]</em></p>
<p>So how can we see something that&#8217;s black against a black night sky? Well, a black hole off by itself would indeed be almost invisible.  <em>[Though detectable because its gravity bends the light of objects behind it, proving it was a black hole and not a clump of, say, dark matter would be tough.]</em></p>
<p>But the centers of galaxies have lots of `gas&#8217; &#8212; not quite what we call `gas&#8217; in school, and certainly not what we put in our cars. `Gas&#8217; is the generalized term astronomers use for any collection of independently wandering atoms (or ions), atomic nuclei, and electrons; if it&#8217;s not just atoms it should really be called <em>plasma</em>, but let&#8217;s not worry about that here. Some of this `gas&#8217; is inevitably orbiting the black hole, and some of it is falling in (and, because of complex interactions with magnetic fields, some is being blasted outward  before it falls in.) That gas, unlike the black hole, <em><strong>will inevitably glow</strong></em> &#8212; it will emit lots of light. <strong>What the astronomers are observing isn&#8217;t the black hole; they&#8217;re observing light from the gas!</strong></p>
<p>And by light, I don&#8217;t only mean what we can see with human eyes. The gas emits electromagnetic waves of all frequencies, including not only the visible frequencies but also much higher frequencies, such as those we call X-rays, and much lower frequencies, such as those we call radio waves. To detect these invisible forms of light, astronomers build all sorts of scientific instruments, which we call them `telescopes&#8217; even though they don&#8217;t involve looking into a tube as with traditional telescopes.</p>
<p><strong>Is this really a &#8220;photograph&#8221; of <em>[the gas in the neighborhood of]</em> a black hole?</strong></p>
<p>Yes and (mostly) no.  What you&#8217;ll be shown is not a picture you could take with a cell-phone camera if you were in a nearby spaceship.  It&#8217;s not visible light that&#8217;s being observed.  But it is invisible light &#8212; radio waves &#8212; and since all light, visible and not, is made from particles called `photons&#8217;, technically you could still say is a &#8220;photo&#8221;-graph.</p>
<p>As I said, the telescope being used in this doesn&#8217;t have a set of mirrors in a tube like your friendly neighbor&#8217;s amateur telescope. Instead, it uses radio receivers to detect electromagnetic waves that have frequencies above what your traditional radio or cell phone can detect<em> [in the hundred gigahertz range, over a thousand times above what your FM radio is sensitive to.]</em>  Though some might call them microwaves, let&#8217;s just call them radio waves; it&#8217;s just a matter of definition.</p>
<p>So the images you will see are based on the observation of electromagnetic waves at these radio frequencies, but they are turned into something visible for us humans using a computer. That means <strong><em>the color of the image is inserted by the computer user and will be arbitrary,</em></strong> so pay it limited attention. It&#8217;s not the color you would see if you were nearby.  <em><strong>Scientists will choose a combination of the color and brightness of the image so as to indicate the brightness of the radio waves observed.</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="color:var(--color-neutral-600);">If you were nearby and looked toward the black hole, you&#8217;d see something else. The gas would probably appear colorless &#8212; white-hot &#8212; and the shape and brightness, though similar, wouldn&#8217;t be identical.</span></p>
<p><strong>If I had radios for eyes, is this what I would see?</strong></p>
<p>Suppose you had radio receivers for eyes instead of the ones you were born with; is this image what you would see if you looked at the black hole from a nearby planet?</p>
<p>Well, to some extent &#8212; but still, not exactly.  There&#8217;s another very important way that what you will see is not a photograph. It is so difficult to make this measurement that <strong><em>the image you will see is highly processed</em></strong> &#8212; that is to say, it will have been cleaned up and adjusted using special mathematics and powerful computers. Various assumptions are key ingredients in this image-processing. Thus, you will not be seeing the `true&#8217; appearance of the [surroundings of the] black hole. <em><strong>You will be seeing the astronomers&#8217; best guess</strong></em> as to this appearance based on partial information and some very intelligent guesswork. Such guesswork may be right, but as we may learn only over time, some of it may not be.</p>
<p>This guesswork is necessary.  To make a nice clear image of something so tiny and faint using radio waves, you&#8217;d naively need a radio receiver as large as the Earth. A trick astronomers use when looking at distant objects it to build gigantic <strong><em>arrays</em></strong> of large radio receivers, which can be combined together to make a `telescope&#8217; much larger and more powerful than any one receiver. The tricks for doing this efficiently are beyond what I can explain here, but involve the term `<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very-long-baseline_interferometry">interferometry</a>&#8216;. Examples of large radio telescope arrays include ALMA, the center part of which can be <a href="https://www.almaobservatory.org/en/images/aerial-view-of-antennas-in-aos-4/">seen in this image</a>, which was built high up on a plateau between two volcanoes in the Atacama desert.</p>
<p>But even ALMA isn&#8217;t up to the task. And we can&#8217;t make a version of ALMA that covers the Earth. So the next best thing is to use ALMA and all of its friends, which are scattered at different locations around the Earth &#8212; <em><strong>an incomplete array of single and multiple radio receivers, combined using all the tricks of interferometry.</strong></em> This is a bit like (and not like) using a telescope that is powerful but has large pieces of its lens missing. You can get an image, but it will be badly distorted.</p>
<p>To figure out what you&#8217;re seeing, you must use your knowledge of your imperfect lens, and <strong><em>work backwards to figure our what your distorted image really would have looked like</em></strong> if you had a perfect lens.</p>
<p>Even that&#8217;s not quite enough: to do this, you need to have a pretty good guess about what you were going to see. That is where you might go astray; <em><strong>if your assumptions are wrong, you might massage the image to look like what you expected instead of how it really ought to look.</strong></em>  <em> [Is this a serious risk?   I&#8217;m not yet expert enough to know the details of how delicate the situation might be.]</em></p>
<p>It is possible that in coming days and weeks there will be controversies about whether the image-processing techniques used and the assumptions underlying them have created artifacts in the images that really shouldn&#8217;t be there, or removed features that should have been there. This could lead to significant disagreements as to how to interpret the images. <em>[Consider these concerns a statement of general prudence based on past experience; I don&#8217;t have enough specific expertise here to give a more detailed opinion.]</em></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff6600;">So in summary, <strong>this is not a photograph you&#8217;d see with your eyes, and it&#8217;s not a complete unadulterated image</strong> &#8212; it&#8217;s a highly-processed image of what a creature with radio eyes might see.  The color is arbitrary; some combination of color and brightness will express the intensity of the radio waves, nothing more.  Treat the images with proper caution and respect.</span></p>
<p><strong>Will the image show what <em>[the immediate neighborhood of]</em> a black hole looks like?</strong></p>
<p>Oh, my friends and colleagues! Could we please try to be a little more careful using the phrase `<strong>looks like</strong>&#8216;? The term has two very different meanings, and in contexts like this one, it really, really matters.</p>
<p>Let me put a spoon into a glass of water: on the left, I&#8217;ve drawn a diagram of what it <strong><span style="color:#008000;">looks like</span></strong>, and on the right, I&#8217;ve put a photograph of what it <span style="color:#993366;"><em><strong>looks like</strong></em></span>.</p>

<p>You notice the difference, no doubt. The spoon on the left looks like a spoon; the spoon on the right looks like something invented by a surrealist painter.  But it&#8217;s just the effect of water and glass on light.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s on the left is a drawing of where the spoon is located inside the glass; it shows not what you would see with your eyes, but rather <strong>a depiction of the `true location&#8217; of the spoon</strong>. On the right is what you will see with your eyes and brain, which is not showing you where the objects are in truth but rather is <strong>showing you where the light from those objects is coming from</strong>. The truth-depiction is drawn as though the light from the object goes straight from the object into your eyes. But <em><strong>when the light from an object does not take a straight path from the objects to you</strong></em> &#8212; as in this case, where the light&#8217;s path bends due to interaction of the light with the water and the glass &#8212; <em><strong>then</strong></em> <em><strong>the image created in your eyes or camera can significantly differ from a depiction of the truth.</strong></em></p>
<p>The same issue arises, of course, with any sort of lens or mirror that isn&#8217;t flat. A room seen through a curved lens, or through an old, misshapen window pane, can look pretty strange.  And gravity? <em><strong>Strong gravity near a black hole drastically modifies the path of any light traveling close by!</strong></em></p>
<p>In the figure below, the left panel shows a depiction of what we think the region around a black hole typically looks like <em><strong>in truth</strong></em>. There is a spinning disk of gas, called the accretion disk, a sort of holding station for the gas. At any moment, a small fraction of the gas, at the inner edge of the disk, has crept too close to the black hole and is starting to spiral in. There are also usually jets of material flying out, roughly aligned with the axis of the black hole&#8217;s rapid rotation and its magnetic field. As I mentioned above, that material is being flung out of the black hole&#8217;s neighborhood (not out of the black hole itself, which would be impossible.)</p>

That is an image of the radio waves as observed here at Earth, after the waves&#8217; paths have been wildly bent &#8212; warped by the intense gravity near the black hole. Just as with any lens or mirror or anything similar, what you will see does not directly reveal what is truly there. Instead, <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em><strong>you must infer what is there from what you see.</strong></em></span></p>
<p>Just as you infer, when you see the broken twisted spoon in the glass, that probably the spoon is not broken or twisted, and the water and glass have refracted the light in familiar ways, so too we must make assumptions to understand what we&#8217;re really looking at in truth after we see the images tomorrow.</p>
<p>How serious are these assumptions?  Certainly, at their first attempt, astronomers will assume Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity, which predicts how the light is bent around a black hole, is correct. But the details of what we infer from what we&#8217;re shown might depend upon whether Einstein&#8217;s formulas are precisely right. It also may depend on the accuracy of our understanding of and assumptions about accretion disks. Further complicating the procedure is that the rate and axis of the black hole&#8217;s rotation affects the details of the bending of the light, and since we&#8217;re not sure of the rotation yet for these black holes, that adds to the assumptions that must gradually be disentangled.</p>
<p><span style="color:#993366;"><strong><em>Because of these assumptions, we will not have an unambiguous understanding of the true nature of what appears in these first images.</em></strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Are we seeing the `shadow&#8217; of a black hole?</strong></p>
<p>A shadow: that&#8217;s what astronomers call it, but as far as I can tell, this word is jargon masquerading as English&#8230; the most pernicious type of jargon.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s a shadow, in English? Your shadow is a dark area on the ground created by you blocking the light from the Sun, which emits light and illuminates the area around you. How would I see your shadow? I&#8217;d look at the ground &#8212; not at you.</p>
<p>This is not what we are doing in this case. The gas is glowing, illuminating the region. The black hole is `blocking&#8217; <em>[caution! see below]</em> some of the light. We&#8217;re looking straight toward the black hole, and seeing dark areas where illumination doesn&#8217;t reach us. This is more like looking at someone&#8217;s silhouette, not someone&#8217;s shadow!</p>

[I&#8217;ve drawn the shadow slightly askew to avoid visual confusion.]  In the black hole images, illumination is provided by the glowing gas, and we&#8217;ll see a sort-of-silhouette [but see below!!!] of the black hole.  There&#8217;s nothing analogous to the ground, or to the person&#8217;s shadow, in the black hole images.</p></div>That being said, <em><strong>it&#8217;s much more clever than a simple silhouette</strong></em>, because of all that pesky bending of the light that the black hole is doing.  In an ordinary silhouette, the light from the illuminator travels in straight lines, and an object blocks part of the light.   But a black hole does not block your view of what&#8217;s behind it;  the light from the gas <strong>behind</strong> it gets bent <strong>around</strong> it, and thus can be seen after all!</p>
<p>Still, after you calculate all the bending, <del>you find out that there&#8217;s a dark area from which no light emerges, which I&#8217;ll informally call a <strong>quasi-silhouette</strong>.  Just outside this is a `photon-sphere&#8217;, which creates a bright ring</del>; <span style="color:#ff0000;">THIS STATEMENT, MADE IN ALL THE PRESS ARTICLES I COULD FIND, IS MISLEADING, AS ARE THE THREE PARAGRAPHS THAT FOLLOW THE IMAGE BELOW; THEY ARE TRUE FOR A PERFECT CAMERA, BUT NOT FOR A CAMERA THAT CAN BARELY SEE THE IMAGE.

<p>Note also that the black hole&#8217;s quasi-silhouette probably won&#8217;t be entirely dark. If material from the accretion disk (or a jet pointing toward us) lies between us and the black hole, it can emit light in our direction, partly filling in the dark region.</p>
<p>Thus the quasi-silhouette we&#8217;ll see in the images is not the outline of the black hole&#8217;s edge, but an effect of the light bending, and is in fact considerably larger than the black hole.  <strong>In truth</strong> it may be as much as 50% larger in radius than the event horizon, and the silhouette as seen in the image <strong>may appear </strong> more than 2.5 to 5 times larger (depending on how fast the black hole rotates) than the true event horizon &#8212; all due to the bent paths of the radio waves. <em>Note Added: THIS ASSUMES THAT THE QUASI-SILHOUETTE IS NOT SUBSTANTIALLY FILLED IN, WHICH, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/06/14/a-ring-of-controversy-around-a-black-hole-photo">IT TURNS OUT</a>, MAY NOT BE TRUE.</em></p>
<p><em>Interestingly, it turns out that the details of how the black hole is rotating don&#8217;t much affect the size of the quasi-silhouette. <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/06/14/a-ring-of-controversy-around-a-black-hole-photo">Note Added: THIS IS TRUE, BUT NOT ENTIRELY RELEVANT WHEN USING AN IMPERFECT CAMERA.</a>  The black hole in the Milky Way is already understood well enough that astronomers know how big its quasi-silhouette ought to appear, even though we don&#8217;t know its rotation speed and axis.  <strong>The quasi-silhouette&#8217;s size in the image will therefore be an important test of Einstein&#8217;s formulas for gravity, even on day one.</strong>  If the size disagrees with expectations, expect a lot of hullabaloo.</em></p>
<p><strong>What is the event horizon, and is it present in the image?</strong></p>
<p>The event horizon of a black hole, in Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity, is not an object. It&#8217;s the edge of a region of no-return, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/black-holes/black-hole-information-paradox-an-introduction/">as I&#8217;ve explained here</a>. Anything that goes past that point can&#8217;t re-emerge, and nothing that happens inside can ever send any light or messages back out.</p>
<p>Despite what some writers are saying, we&#8217;re not expecting to see the event horizon in the images. As is hopefully clear by now, what astronomers are observing is (a) the radio waves from the gas near the black hole, after the waves have taken strongly curved paths, and (b) a quasi-silhouette of the black hole from which radio waves don&#8217;t emerge. But as I explained above, <em><strong>this quasi-silhouette is considerably larger than the event horizon, </strong></em>both in truth and in appearance. The event horizon does not emit any light, and it sits well inside the quasi-silhouette, not at its edge.</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">Still, <em><strong>what we&#8217;ll be seeing is closer to the event horizon than anything we&#8217;ve ever seen before</strong></em>, which is really exciting!   And if the silhouette has an unexpected appearance, we just might get our first hint of a breakdown of Einstein&#8217;s understanding of event horizons.  Don&#8217;t bet on it, but you can hope for it.</span></p>
<p><strong>Can we hope to see the singularity of a black hole?</strong></p>
<p>No, for two reasons.</p>
<p>First, <strong><em>there probably is no singularity in the first place</em></strong>. It drives me nuts when people say there&#8217;s a singularity inside a black hole; that&#8217;s just wrong. The correct statement is that in Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity, singularities (i.e. unavoidable infinities) arise <em><strong>in the math</strong></em> &#8212; in the <em><strong>formulas</strong></em> for black holes (or more precisely, in the solutions to those formulas that describe black holes.) But <em><strong>a singularity in the math</strong></em> <em><strong>does not mean that there&#8217;s a singularity in nature!  </strong></em>It usually means that the math isn&#8217;t quite right &#8212; not that anyone made a mistake, but that the formulas that we&#8217;re using aren&#8217;t appropriate, and need to be modified in some way, because of some natural phenomenon that we don&#8217;t yet understand.</p>
<p>A singularity in a formula implies a <strong>mystery</strong> in nature &#8212; <em><strong>not</strong></em> <strong>a singularity</strong> in nature.</p>
<p>In fact, historically, in every previous case where singularities have appeared in formulas, it simply meant that the formula (or solution) was not accurate in that context, or wasn&#8217;t being used correctly. We already know that Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity can&#8217;t be complete (it doesn&#8217;t accommodate quantum physics, which is also a part of the real world) and it would be no surprise if its incompleteness is responsible for these infinities. The math singularity merely signifies that the physics very deep inside a black hole isn&#8217;t understood yet.</p>
<p><em>[The same issue afflicts the statement that <strong>the Big Bang began with a singularity</strong>; the solution to the equations has a singularity, yes, but that&#8217;s very far from saying that nature&#8217;s Big Bang actually began with one.]</em></p>
<p>Ok, so how about revising the question: is there any hope of seeing the region deep inside the black hole where Einstein&#8217;s equations have a singularity? No. Remember what&#8217;s being observed is the stuff outside the black hole, and the black hole&#8217;s quasi-silhouette. What happens inside a black hole stays inside a black hole. Anything else is inference.</p>
<p><em>[More precisely, what happens inside a huge black hole stays inside a black hole for eons.  For tiny black holes it comes out sooner, but even so it is hopelessly scrambled in the form of `Hawking radiation.&#8217;]</em></p>
<p><strong>Any other questions?</strong></p>
<p>Maybe there are some questions that are bothering readers that I haven&#8217;t addressed here?  I&#8217;m super-busy this afternoon and all day Wednesday with non-physics things, but maybe if you ask the question early enough I can get address it here before the press conference (at 9 am Wednesday, New York City time).   Also, if you find my answers confusing, please comment; I can try to further clarify them for later readers.</p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;"><strong>It&#8217;s a historic moment, or at least the first stage in a historic process.  To me, as I hope to all of you, it&#8217;s all very exciting and astonishing how the surreal weirdness of Einstein&#8217;s understanding of gravity, and the creepy mysteries of black holes, have suddenly, in just a few quick years, become undeniably real!</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There has long been a question as to what types of events and processes are responsible for the highest-energy neutrinos coming from space and observed by scientists.  Another question, probably related, is what creates the majority of high-energy <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/04/03/ams-presents-some-first-results/">cosmic rays</a> &#8212; the particles, mostly <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/">protons</a>, that are constantly raining down upon the Earth.</p>
<p>As scientists&#8217; ability to detect high-energy neutrinos <em>(particles that are hugely abundant, electrically neutral, very light-weight, and <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/how-one-detects-neutrinos/">very difficult to observe</a>)</em> and high-energy photons <em>(particles of light, though not necessarily of visible light) </em>have become more powerful and precise, there&#8217;s been considerable hope of getting an answer to these question.  One of the things we&#8217;ve been awaiting (<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/05/09/neutrinos-from-that-recent-gamma-ray-burst/">and been disappointed</a> a couple of times) is a violent explosion out in the universe that produces both high-energy photons and neutrinos at the same time, at a high enough rate that both types of particles can be observed at the same time coming from the same direction.</p>
<p>In recent years, there has been some indirect evidence that blazars &#8212; narrow jets of particles, pointed in our general direction like the barrel of a gun, and created as material swirls near and almost into giant black holes in the centers of very distant galaxies &#8212; may be responsible for the high-energy neutrinos.  Strong direct evidence in favor of this hypothesis has just been presented today.   Last year, one of these blazars flared brightly, and the flare created both high-energy neutrinos and high-energy photons that were observed within the same period, coming from the same place in the sky.</p>
<p><a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/how-one-detects-neutrinos/icecube-a-giant-frozen-neutrino-catcher/">I have written about the IceCube neutrino observatory before</a>; it&#8217;s a cubic kilometer of ice under the South Pole, instrumented with light detectors, and it&#8217;s ideal for observing neutrinos whose motion-energy far exceeds that of the protons in the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">Large Hadron Collider</a>, where the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/why-the-higgs-particle-matters/">Higgs particle</a> was discovered.  These neutrinos mostly pass through Ice Cube undetected, but one in 100,000 hits something, and debris from the collision produces visible light that Ice Cube&#8217;s detectors can record.   IceCube has already made important discoveries, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/05/16/possible-important-discovery-at-icecube/">detecting a new class of high-energy neutrinos</a>.</p>
<p>On Sept 22 of last year, one of these very high-energy neutrinos was observed at IceCube. More precisely, a muon created underground by the collision of this neutrino with an atomic nucleus <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/how-one-detects-neutrinos/icecube-a-giant-frozen-neutrino-catcher/">was observed in</a> IceCube.  To create the observed muon, the neutrino must have had a motion-energy tens of thousand times larger than than the motion-energy of each proton at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).  And the direction of the neutrino&#8217;s motion is known too; it&#8217;s essentially the same as that of the observed muon.  So IceCube&#8217;s scientists knew where, on the sky, this neutrino had come from.</p>
<p><em>(This doesn&#8217;t work for typical cosmic rays; protons, for instance, travel in curved paths because they are deflected by cosmic magnetic fields, so even if you measure their travel direction at their arrival to Earth, you don&#8217;t then know where they came from. Neutrinos, beng electrically neutral, aren&#8217;t affected by magnetic fields and travel in a straight line, just as photons do.)</em></p>
<p>Very close to that direction is a well-known blazar (TXS-0506), four billion light years away (a good fraction of the distance across the visible universe).</p>
<p>The IceCube scientists immediately reported their neutrino observation to scientists with high-energy photon detectors.  (I&#8217;ve also written about some of the detectors used to study the very high-energy photons that we find in the sky: in particular, the <a href="http://www-glast.stanford.edu/">Fermi/LAT satellite</a> played a role in this latest discovery.) Fermi/LAT, which continuously monitors the sky, was already detecting high-energy photons coming from the same direction.   Within a few days the Fermi scientists had confirmed that TXS-0506 was indeed flaring at the time &#8212; already starting in April 2017 in fact, six times as bright as normal.  With this news from IceCube and Fermi/LAT, many other telescopes (including the <a href="https://wwwmagic.mpp.mpg.de/">MAGIC cosmic ray detector telescopes</a> among others) then followed suit and studied the blazar, learning more about the properties of its flare.</p>
<p>Now, just a single neutrino on its own isn&#8217;t entirely convincing; is it possible that this was all just a coincidence?  So the IceCube folks went back to their older data to snoop around.  There they discovered, in their 2014-2015 data, a dramatic flare <strong><em>in neutrinos</em></strong> &#8212; more than a dozen neutrinos, seen over 150 days, had come from the same direction in the sky where TXS-0506 is sitting.  (More precisely, nearly 20 from this direction were seen, in a time period where normally there&#8217;d just be 6 or 7 by random chance.)  This confirms that this blazar is indeed a source of neutrinos.  And from the energies of the neutrinos in this flare, yet more can be learned about this blazar, and how it makes  high-energy photons and neutrinos at the same time.  Interestingly, so far at least, there&#8217;s no strong evidence for this 2014 flare in photons, except perhaps an increase in the number of the highest-energy photons&#8230; but not in the total brightness of the source.</p>
<p>The full picture, still emerging, tends to support the idea that the blazar arises from a supermassive black hole, acting as a natural particle accelerator, making a narrow spray of particles, <em><strong>including protons</strong></em>, at extremely high energy.  These protons, millions of times more energetic than those at the Large Hadron Collider, then collide with more ordinary particles that are just wandering around, such as visible-light photons from starlight or infrared photons from the ambient heat of the universe.  The collisions <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/09/23/how-to-make-a-neutrino-beam/">produce particles called pions, made from quarks and anti-quarks and gluons (just as protons are), which in turn decay either to photons or to (among other things) neutrinos</a>.  And its those resulting photons and neutrinos which have now been jointly observed.</p>
<p>Since cosmic rays, the mysterious high energy particles from outer space that are constantly raining down on our planet, are mostly protons, <em><strong>this is evidence that many, perhaps most, of the highest energy cosmic rays are created in the natural particle accelerators associated with blazars.</strong></em> Many scientists have suspected that the most extreme cosmic rays are associated with the most active black holes at the centers of galaxies, and now we have evidence and more details in favor of this idea.  It now appears likely that that this question will be answerable over time, as more blazar flares are observed and studied.</p>
<p>The announcement of this important discovery was made at the National Science Foundation by Francis Halzen, the IceCube principal investigator, Olga Botner, former IceCube spokesperson, Regina Caputo, the Fermi-LAT analysis coordinator, and Razmik Mirzoyan, MAGIC spokesperson.</p>
<p>The fact that both photons and neutrinos have been observed from the same source is an example of what people are now calling &#8220;multi-messenger astronomy&#8221;; a previous example was<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2017/10/17/the-significance-of-yesterdays-gravitational-wave-announcement-an-faq/"> the observation in gravitational waves, and in photons of many different energies, of two merging neutron stars</a>.  Of course, something like this already happened in <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/09/20/supernovas-and-neutrinos/">1987, when a supernova was seen by eye, and also observed in neutrinos</a>.  But in this case, the neutrinos and photons have energies millions and billions of times larger!</p>

<p>The top plot shows the number of X-rays (high-energy photons [particles of light]) coming from the sun, and that huge spike in the middle of the plot indicates a very powerful solar flare occurred about 24 hours ago.  It should take about 2 days from the time of the flare for its other effects &#8212; the cloud of electrically-charged particles expelled from the Sun&#8217;s atmosphere &#8212; to arrive at Earth.  The electrically-charged particles are what generate the auroras, when they are directed by Earth&#8217;s magnetic field to enter the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere near the Earth&#8217;s magnetic poles, where they crash into atoms in the upper atmosphere, exciting them and causing them to radiate visible light.</p>
<p>The flare was very powerful, but its cloud of particles didn&#8217;t head straight for Earth.  We might get only a glancing blow.  So we don&#8217;t know how big an effect to expect here on our planet.  All we can do for now is be hopeful, and wait.</p>
<p>In any case, auroras borealis and australis are possible in the next day or so.  Watch for the middle plot to go haywire, and for the bars in the lower plot to jump higher; then you know the time has arrived.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back in 1999 I saw a total solar eclipse in Europe, and it was a life-altering experience.  I wrote about it back then, but was never entirely happy with the article.  This week I&#8217;ve revised it.  It could still benefit from some editing and revision (comments welcome), but I think it&#8217;s now a good read.  It&#8217;s full of intellectual observations, but there are powerful emotions too.</p>

<p><strong> A Luminescent Darkness: My 1999 Eclipse Adventure</strong></p>
<p>© Matt Strassler 1999</p>
<p>After two years of dreaming, two months of planning, and two hours of packing, I drove to John F. Kennedy airport, took the shuttle to the Air France terminal, and checked in.  I was brimming with excitement. In three days time, with a bit of luck, I would witness one the great spectacles that a human being can experience: a complete, utter and total eclipse of the Sun.<span id="more-9609"></span></p>
<p>I had missed one eight years earlier. In July 1991, a total solar eclipse crossed over Baja California. I had thought seriously about driving the fourteen hundred miles from the San Francisco area, where I was a graduate student studying theoretical physics, to the very southern tip of the peninsula. But worried about my car&#8217;s ill health and scared by rumors of gasoline shortages in Baja, I chickened out. Four of my older colleagues, more worldly and more experienced, and supplied with a more reliable vehicle, drove down together. When they returned, exhilarated, they regaled us with stories of their magical adventure. Hearing their tales, I kicked myself for not going, and had been kicking myself ever since. Life is not so long that such opportunities can be rationalized or procrastinated away.</p>
<p>A total eclipse of the Sun is a event of mythic significance, so rare and extraordinary and unbelievable that it really ought to exist only in ancient legends, in epic poems, and in science fiction stories. There are other types of eclipses &#8212; partial and total eclipses of the Moon, in which the Earth blocks sunlight that normally illuminates the Moon, and various eclipses of the Sun in which the Moon blocks sunlight that normally illuminates the Earth. But total solar eclipses are in a class all their own. Only during the brief moments of totality does the Sun vanish altogether, leaving the shocked spectator in a suddenly darkened world, gazing uncomprehendingly at a black disk of nothingness.</p>
<p>Our species relies on daylight. Day is warm; day grows our food; day permits travel with a clear sense of what lies ahead. We are so fearful of the night &#8212; of what lurks there unseen, of the sounds that we cannot interpret. Horror films rely on this fear; demons and axe murderers are rarely found walking about in bright sunshine. Dark places are dangerous places; sudden unexpected darkness is worst of all. These are the conventions of cinema, born of our inmost psychology. But the Sun and the Moon are not actors projected on a screen. The terror is real.</p>
<p>It has been said that if the Earth were a member of a federation of a million planets, it would be a famous tourist attraction, because this home of ours would be the only one in the republic with such beautiful eclipses. For our skies are witness to a coincidence truly of cosmic proportions. It is a stunning accident that although the Sun is so immense that it could hold a million Earths, and the Moon so small that dozens could fit inside our planet, these two spheres, the brightest bodies in Earth&#8217;s skies, appear the same size. A faraway giant may seem no larger than a nearby child. And this perfect match of their sizes and distances makes our planet&#8217;s eclipses truly spectacular, visually and scientifically. They are described by witnesses as a sight of weird and unique beauty, a visual treasure completely unlike anything else a person will ever see, or even imagine.</p>
<p>But total solar eclipses are uncommon, occurring only once every year or two. Even worse, totality only occurs in a narrow band that sweeps across the Earth &#8212; often just across its oceans. Only a small fraction of the Earth sees a total eclipse in any century. And so these eclipses are precious; only the lucky, or the devoted, will experience one before they die.</p>
<p>In my own life, I&#8217;d certainly been more devoted than lucky. I knew it wasn&#8217;t wise to wait for the Moon&#8217;s shadow to find me by chance. Instead I was going on a journey to place myself in its path.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge in eclipse-chasing is the logistics. The area in which totality is visible is very long but very narrow. For my trip, in 1999, it was a long strip running west to east all across Europe, but only a hundred miles wide from north to south. A narrow zone crossing heavily populated areas is sure to attract a massive crowd, so finding hotels and transport can be difficult. Furthermore, although eclipses are precisely predictable, governed by the laws of gravity worked out by Isaac Newton himself, weather and human beings are far less dependable.</p>
<p>But I had a well-considered plan. I would travel by train to a small city east of Paris, where I had reserved a rental car. Keeping a close watch on the weather forecast, I would drive on back roads, avoiding clogged highways. I had no hotel reservations. It would have been pointless to make them for the night before the event, since it was well known that everything within two hours drive of the totality zone was booked solid. Moreover, I wanted the flexibility to adjust to the weather and couldn&#8217;t know in advance where I&#8217;d want to stay. So my idea was that on the night prior to the eclipse, I would drive to a good location in the path of the lunar shadow, and sleep in the back of my car. I had a sleeping bag with me to keep me warm, and enough lightweight clothing for the week &#8212; and not much else.</p>
<p>Oh, it was such a good plan, clean and simple, and that&#8217;s why my heart had so far to sink and my brain so ludicrous a calamity to contemplate when I checked my wallet, an hour before flight time, and saw a gaping black emptiness where my driver&#8217;s license was supposed to be. I was struck dumb. No license meant no car rental; no car meant no flexibility and no place to sleep. Sixteen years of driving and I had never lost it before; why, why, of all times, now, when it was to play a central role in a once-in-a-lifetime adventure?</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t panic. I walked calmly back to the check-in counters, managed to get myself rescheduled for a flight on the following day, drove the three hours back to New Jersey, and started looking. It wasn&#8217;t in my car. Nor was it in the pile of unneeded items I&#8217;d removed from my wallet. Not in my suitcase, not under my bed, not in my office. As it was Sunday, I couldn&#8217;t get a replacement license. Hope dimmed, flickered, and went dark.</p>
<p>Deep breaths. Plan B?</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t have a tent, and couldn&#8217;t easily have found one. But I did have a rain poncho, large enough to keep my sleeping bag off the ground. As long as it didn&#8217;t rain too hard, I could try, the night before the eclipse, to find a place to camp outdoors; with luck I&#8217;d find lodging for the other nights. I doubted this would be legal, but I was willing to take the chance. But what about my suitcase? I couldn&#8217;t carry that around with me into the wilderness. Fortunately, I knew a solution. For a year after college, I had studied music in France, and had often gone sightseeing by rail. On those trips I had commonly made use of the ubiquitous lockers at the train stations, leaving some luggage while I explored the nearby town. As for flexibility of location, that was unrecoverable; the big downside of Plan B was that I could no longer adjust to the weather. I&#8217;d just have to be lucky. I comforted myself with the thought that the worst that could happen to me would be a week of eating French food.</p>
<p>So the next day, carrying the additional weight of a poncho and an umbrella, but having in compensation discarded all inessential clothing and tourist information, I headed back to the airport, this time by bus. Without further misadventures, I was soon being carried across the Atlantic.</p>
<p>As usual I struggled to nap amid the loud silence of a night flight. But my sleeplessness was rewarded with one of those good omens that makes you think that you must be doing the right thing. As we approached the European coastline, and I gazed sleepily out my window, I suddenly saw a bright glowing light. It was the rising white tip of the thin crescent Moon.</p>
<p>Solar eclipses occur at New Moon, always. This is nothing but simple geometry; the Moon must place itself exactly between the Sun and the Earth to cause an eclipse, and that means the half of the Moon that faces us must be in shadow. (At Full Moon, the opposite is true; the Earth is between the Sun and the Moon, so the half of the Moon that faces us is in full sunlight. That&#8217;s when lunar eclipses can occur.) And just before a New Moon, the Moon is close to the Sun&#8217;s location in the sky. It becomes visible, as the Earth turns, just before the Sun does, rising as a morning crescent shortly before sunrise. (Similarly, we get an evening crescent just after a New Moon.)</p>
<p>There, out over the vast Atlantic, from a dark ocean of water into a dark sea of stars, rose the delicate thin slip of Luna the lover, on her way to her mystical rendezvous with Sol. Her crescent smiled at me and winked a greeting. I smiled back, and whispered, &#8220;see you in two days&#8230;&#8221; For totality is not merely the only time you can look straight at the Sun and see its crown. It is the only time you can see the New Moon.</p>
<p>We landed in Paris at 6:30 Monday morning, E-day-minus-two. I headed straight to the airport train station, and poured over rail maps and my road maps trying to guess a good location to use as a base. Eventually I chose a medium-sized town with the name Charleville-Mezieres. It was on the northern edge of the totality zone, at the end of a large spoke of the Paris-centered rail system, and was far enough from Paris, Brussels, and all large German towns that I suspected it might escape the worst of the crowds. It would then be easy, the night before the eclipse, to take a train back into the center of the zone, where totality would last the longest.</p>
<p>Two hours later I was in the Paris-East rail station and had purchased my ticket for Charleville-Mezieres. With ninety minutes to wait, I wandered around the station. It was evident that France had gone eclipse-happy. Every magazine had a cover story; every newspaper had a special insert; signs concerning the event were everywhere. Many of the magazines carried free eclipse glasses, with a black opaque metallic material for lenses that only the Sun can penetrate. Warnings against looking at the Sun without them were to be found on every newspaper front page. I soon learned that there had been a dreadful scandal in which a widely distributed shipment of imported glasses was discovered to be dangerously defective, leading the government to make a hurried and desperate attempt to recall them. There were also many leaflets advertising planned events in towns lying in the totality zone, and information about extra trains that would be running. A chaotic rush out of Paris was clearly expected.</p>
<p>Before noon I was on a train heading through the Paris suburbs into the farmlands of the Champagne region. The rocking of the train put me right to sleep, but the shrieking children halfway up the rail car quickly ended my nap. I watched the lovely sunlit French countryside as it rolled by. The Sun was by now well overhead &#8212; or rather, the Earth had rotated so that France was nearly facing the Sun head on. Sometimes, when the train banked on a turn, the light nearly blinded me, and I had to close my eyes.</p>
<p>With my eyelids shut, I thought about how I&#8217;d managed, over decades, to avoid ever once accidentally staring at the Sun for even a second&#8230; and about how almost every animal with eyes manages to do this during its entire life. It&#8217;s quite a feat, when you think about it. But it&#8217;s essential, of course. The Sun&#8217;s ferocious blaze is even worse than it appears, for it contains more than just visible light. It also radiates light too violet for us to see &#8212; ultraviolet &#8212; which is powerful enough to destroy our vision. Any animal lacking instincts powerful enough to keep its eyes off the Sun will go blind, soon to starve or be eaten. But humans are in danger during solar eclipses, because our intense curiosity can make us ignore our instincts. Many of us will suffer permanent eye damage, not understanding when and how it is safe to look at the Sun&#8230; which is almost, but not quite, never.</p>
<p>In fact the only time it is safe to look with the naked eye is during totality, when the Sun&#8217;s disk is completely blocked by the New Moon, and the world is dark. Then, and only then, can one see that the Sun is not a sphere, and that it has a sort of atmosphere, immense and usually unseen.</p>
<p>At the heart of the Sun, and source of its awesome power, is its nuclear furnace, nearly thirty million degrees hot and nearly five billion years old. All that heat gradually filters and boils out of the Sun&#8217;s core toward its visible surface, which is a mere six thousand degrees&#8230; still white-hot. Outside this region is a large irregular halo of material that is normally too dim to see against the blinding disk. The inner part of that halo is called the chromosphere; there, giant eruptions called &#8220;prominences&#8221; loop outward into space. The outer part of the halo is the &#8220;corona&#8221;, Latin for &#8220;crown.&#8221; The opportunity to see the Sun&#8217;s corona is one of the main reasons to seek totality.</p>
<p>Still very drowsy, but in a good mood, I arrived in Charleville. Wanting to leave my bags in the station while I looked for a hotel room, I searched for the luggage lockers. After three tiring trips around the station, I asked at a ticket booth. &#8220;Oh,&#8221; said the woman behind the desk, &#8220;we haven&#8217;t had them available since the Algerian terrorism of a few years ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>I gulped. This threatened plan B, for what was I to do with my luggage on eclipse day? I certainly couldn&#8217;t walk out into the French countryside looking for a place to camp while carrying a full suitcase and a sleeping bag! And even the present problem of looking for a hotel would be daunting. The woman behind the desk was sympathetic, but her only suggestion was to try one of the hotels near the station. Since the tourist information office was a mile away, it seemed the only good option, and I lugged my bags across the street.</p>
<p>Here, finally, luck smiled. The very first place I stopped at had a room for that night, reasonably priced and perfectly clean, if spartan. It was also available the night after the eclipse. My choice of Charleville had been wise. Unfortunately, even here, Eclipse Eve &#8212; Tuesday evening &#8212; was as bad as I imagined. The hoteliere assured me that all of Charleville was booked (and my later attempts to find a room, even a last-minute cancellation, proved fruitless.) Still, she she was happy for me to leave my luggage at the hotel while I tramped through the French countryside. Thus was Plan B saved.</p>
<p>Somewhat relieved, I wandered around the town. Charleville is not unattractive, and the orange sandstone 16th century architecture of its central square is very pleasing to the eye. By dusk I was exhausted and collapsed on my bed. I slept long and deep, and awoke refreshed. I took a short sightseeing trip by train, ate a delicious lunch, and tried one more time to find a room in Charleville for Eclipse Eve. Failing once again, I resolved to camp in the heart of the totality zone.</p>
<p>But where? I had several criteria in mind. For the eclipse, I wanted to be far from any large town or highway, so that streetlights, often automatically triggered by darkness, would not spoil the experience. Also I wanted hills and farmland; I wanted to be at a summit, with no trees nearby, in order to have the best possible view. It didn&#8217;t take long to decide on a location. About five miles south of the unassuming town of Rethel, rebuilt after total destruction in the first world war, my map showed a high hill. It seemed perfect.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I learned just in time that this same high hill had attracted the attention of the local authorities, and they had decided to designate this very place the &#8220;official viewing site&#8221; in the region. A hundred thousand people were expected to descend on Rethel and take shuttles from the town to the &#8220;site.&#8221; Clearly this was not where I wanted to be!</p>
<p>So instead, when I arrived in Rethel, I walked in another direction. I aimed for an area a few miles west of town, quiet hilly farmland.</p>
<p>Yet again, my luck seemed to be on the wane. By four it was drizzling, and by five it was raining. Darkness would settle at around eight, and I had little time to find a site for unobtrusive camping, much less a dry one. The rain stopped, restarted, hesitated, spat, but refused to go away. An unending mass of rain clouds could be seen heading toward me from the west. I had hoped to use trees for some shelter against rain, but now the trees were drenched and dripping, even worse than the rain itself.</p>
<p>Still completely unsure what I would do, I continued walking into the evening. I must have cut a very odd figure, carrying an open umbrella, a sleeping bag, and a small black backpack. I took a break in a village square, taking shelter at a church&#8217;s side door, where I munched on French bread and cheese. Maybe one of these farmers would let me sleep in a dry spot in his barn, I thought to myself. But I still hadn&#8217;t reached the hills I was aiming for, so I kept walking.</p>
<p>After another mile, I came to a hilltop with a dirt farm track crossing the road. There, just off the road to the right, was a large piece of farm machinery. And underneath it, a large, flat, sheltered spot. Hideous, but I could sleep there. Since it wasn&#8217;t quite nightfall yet and I could see a hill on the other side of the road along the same track, one which looked like it might be good for watching the eclipse, I took a few minutes to explore it. There I found another piece of farm equipment, also with a sheltered underbelly. This one was much further from the road, looked unused, and presumably offered both safer and quieter shelter. It was sitting just off the dirt track in a fallow field. The field was of thick, sticky, almost hard mud, the kind you don&#8217;t slip in and which doesn&#8217;t ooze but which gloms onto the sides of your shoe.</p>
<p>And so it was that Eclipse Eve found me spreading my poncho in a friendly unknown farmer&#8217;s field, twisting my body so as not to hit my head on the metal bars of my shelter, carefully unwrapping my sleeping bag and removing my shoes so as not to cover everything in mud, brushing my teeth in bottled water, and bedding down for the night. The whole scene was so absurd that I found myself sporting a slightly manic grin and giggling. But still, I was satisfied. Despite the odds, I was in the zone at the appointed time; when I awoke the next morning I would be scarcely two miles from my final destination. If the clouds were against me, so be it. I had done my part.</p>
<p>I slept pretty well, considering both my excitement and the uneven ground. At daybreak I was surrounded by fog, but by 8 a.m.~the fog was lifting, revealing a few spots of blue sky amid low clouds. My choice of shelter was also confirmed; my sleeping bag was dry, and across the road the other piece of machinery I had considered was already in use.</p>
<p>I packed up and started walking west again. The weather seemed uncertain, with three layers of clouds &#8212; low stratus, medium cumulus, and high cirrus &#8212; crossing over each other. Blue patches would appear, then close up. I trudged to the base of my chosen hill, then followed another dirt track to the top, where I was graced with a lovely view. The rolling <em>paysage</em> of fertile France stretched before me, blotched here and there with sunshine.  Again I had chosen well, better than I realized, as it turned out, for I was not alone on the hill. A Belgian couple had chosen it too &#8212; and they had a car&#8230;</p>
<p>There I waited. The minutes ticked by. The temperature fluctuated, and the fields changed color, as the Sun played hide and seek. I didn&#8217;t need these reminders of the Sun&#8217;s importance &#8212; that without its heat the Earth would freeze, and without its light, plants would not grow and the cycle of life would quickly end. I thought about how pre-scientific cultures had viewed the Sun. In cultures and religions around the world, the blazing disk has often been attributed divine power and regal authority. And why not? In the past century, we&#8217;ve finally learned what the Sun is made from and why it shines. But we are no less in awe than our ancestors, for the Sun is much larger, much older, and much more powerful than most of them imagined.</p>
<p>For a while, I listened to the radio. Crowds were assembling across Europe. Special events &#8212; concerts, art shows, contests &#8212; were taking place, organized by towns in the zone to coincide with the eclipse. This was hardly surprising. All those tourists had come for totality. But totality is brief, never more than a handful of minutes.  It&#8217;s the luck of geometry, the details of the orbits of the Earth and Moon, that set its duration. For my eclipse, the Moon&#8217;s shadow was only about a hundred miles wide. Racing along at three thousand miles per hour, it would darken any one location for at most two minutes. Now if a million people are expected to descend on your town for a two-minute event, I suppose it is a good idea to give them something else to do while they wait. And of course, the French cultural establishment loves this kind of opportunity. Multimedia events are their specialty, and they often give commissions to contemporary artists. I was particularly amused to discover later that an old acquaintance of mine &#8212; I met him in 1987 at the composers&#8217; entrance exams for the Paris Conservatory &#8212; had been commissioned to write an orchestral piece, called &#8220;Eclipse,&#8221; for the festival in the large city of Reims. It was performed just before the moment of darkness.</p>
<p>Finally, around 11:30, the eclipse began. The Moon nibbled a tiny notch out of the sun. I looked at it briefly through my eclipse glasses, and felt the first butterflies of anticipation. The Belgian couple, in their late fourties, came up to the top of the hill and stood alongside me. They were Flemish, but the man spoke French, and we chatted for a while. It turned out he was a scientist also, and had spent some time in the United States, so we had plenty to talk about. But our discussion kept turning to the clouds, which showed no signs of dissipating. The Sun was often veiled by thin cirrus or completely hidden by thick cumulus. We kept a nervous watch.</p>
<p>Time crawled as the Moon inched across the brilliant disk. It passed the midway point and the Sun became a crescent. With only twenty minutes before totality, my Belgian friends conversed in Dutch. The man turned to me. &#8220;We have decided to drive toward that hole in the clouds back to the east,&#8221; he said in French. &#8220;It&#8217;s really not looking so good here. Do you want to come with us?&#8221; I paused to think. How far away was that hole? Would we end up back at the town? Would we get caught in traffic? Would we end up somewhere low? What were my chances if I stayed where I was? I hesitated, unsure. If I went with them, I was subject to their whims, not my own. But after looking at the oncoming clouds one more time, I decided my present location was not favorable. I joined them.</p>
<p>We descended the dirt track and turned left onto the road I&#8217;d taken so long to walk. It was completely empty. We kept one eye on where we were going and five eyes on the sky. After two miles, the crescent sun became visible through a large gap in the low clouds. There were still high thin clouds slightly veiling it, but the sky around it was a pale blue. We went a bit further, and then stopped&#8230; at the very same dirt track where I had slept the night before. A line of ten or fifteen cars now stretched along it, but there was plenty of room for our vehicle.</p>
<p>By now, with ten minutes to go, the light was beginning to change. When only five percent of the Sun remains, your eye can really tell. The blues become deeper, the whites become milkier, and everything is more subdued. Also it becomes noticeably cooler. I&#8217;d seen this light before, in New Mexico in 1994. I had gone there to watch an &#8220;annular&#8221; eclipse of the Sun. An annular eclipse occurs when the Moon passes directly in front of the Sun but is just a bit too far away from the Earth for its shadow to reach the ground. In such an eclipse, the Moon fails to completely block the Sun; a narrow ringlet, or &#8220;annulus&#8221;, often called the &#8220;ring of fire,&#8221; remains visible. That day I watched from a mountain top, site of several telescopes, in nearly clear skies. But imagine the dismay of the spectators as the four-and-a-half minutes of annularity were blocked by a five-minute cloud! Fortunately there was a bright spot. For a brief instant &#8212; no more than three seconds &#8212; the cloud became thin, and a perfect circle of light shone through, too dim to penetrate eclipse glasses but visible with the naked eye&#8230; a veiled, surreal vision.</p>
<p>On the dirt track in the middle of French fields, we started counting down the minutes. There was more and more tension in the air. I put faster speed film into my camera. The light became still milkier, and as the crescent became a fingernail, all eyes were focused either on the Sun itself or on a small but thick and dangerous-looking cloud heading straight for it. Except mine. I didn&#8217;t care if I saw the last dot of sunlight disappear. What I wanted to watch was the coming of Moon-shadow.</p>
<p>One of my motivations for seeking a hill was that I wanted to observe the approach of darkness. Three thousand miles an hour is just under a mile per second, so if one had a view extending out five miles or so, I thought, one could really see the edge coming. I expected it would be much like watching the shadow of a cloud coming toward me, with the darkness sweeping along the ground, only much darker and faster. I looked to the west and waited for the drama to unfold.</p>
<p>And it did, but it was not what I was expecting. Even though observing the shadow is a common thing for eclipse watchers to do, nothing I had ever read about eclipses prepared me in the slightest for what I was about to witness. I&#8217;ve never seen it photographed, or even described. Maybe it was an effect of all the clouds around us. Or maybe others, just as I do, find it difficult to convey.</p>
<p>For how can one relate the sight of daylight sliding swiftly, like an sigh, to deep twilight? of the western sky, seen through scattered clouds, changing seamlessly and inexorably from blue to pink to slate gray to the last yellow of sunset? of colors rising up out of the horizon and spreading across the sky like water from a broken dyke flooding onto a field?</p>
<p>I cannot find the right combination of words to capture the sense of being swept up, of being overwhelmed, of being transfixed with awe, as one might be before the summoning of a great wave or a great wind by the command of a god, yet all in utter silence and great beauty. Reliving it as I write this brings a tear. In the end I have nothing to compare it to.</p>
<p>The great metamorphosis passed. The light stabilized. Shaken, I looked up.</p>
<p>And quickly looked away. I had seen a near-disk of darkness, the fuzzy whiteness of the corona, and some bright dots around the disk&#8217;s edge, one especially bright where the Sun still clearly shone through. Accidentally I had seen with my naked eyes the &#8220;diamond ring,&#8221; a moment when the last brilliant drop of Sun and the glistening corona are simultaneously visible. It&#8217;s not safe to look at. I glanced again. Still several bright dots. I glanced again. Still there &#8212; but the Sun had to be covered by now&#8230;</p>
<p>So I looked longer, and realized that the Sun was indeed covered, that those bright dots were there to stay. There it was. The eclipsed Sun, or rather, the dark disk of the New Moon, surrounded by the Sun&#8217;s crown, studded at its edge with seven bright pink jewels. It was bizarre, awe-inspiring, a spooky hallucination. It shimmered.</p>
<p>The Sun&#8217;s corona didn&#8217;t really resemble what I had seen in photographs, and I could immediately see why. The corona looked as though it were made of glistening white wispy hair, billowing outward like a mop of whiskers. It gleamed with a celestial light, a shine resembling that of well-lit tinsel. No camera could capture that glow, no photograph reproduce it.</p>
<p>But the greatest, most delightful surprise was the seven beautiful gems. I knew they had to be the great eruptions on the surface of the Sun, prominences, huge magnetic storms larger than our planet and more violent than anything else in the solar system. However, nobody ever told me they were bright pink! I always assumed they were orange (silly of me, since the whole Sun looks orange if you look at it through an orange filter, which the photographs always do.) They were arranged almost symmetrically around the sun, with one of them actually well separated from its surface and halfway out into the lovely soft filaments of the corona. I explored them with my binoculars. The colors, the glistening timbre, the rich detail, it is a visual delight. The scene is living, vibrant, delicate and soft; by comparison, all the photographs and films seem dry, flat, deadened.</p>
<p>I was surprised at my calm. After the great rush of the shadow, the stasis of totality had caught me off guard.  Around me it was much lighter than I had expected. The sense was of late twilight, with a deep blue-purple sky; yet it was still bright enough to read by. The yellow light of late sunset stretched all the way around the horizon. The planet Venus was visible, but no stars peeked through the clouds. Perhaps longer eclipses have darker skies, a larger Moon-shadow putting daylight further away.</p>
<p>I had scarcely had time to absorb all of this when, just at the halfway point of totality, the dangerous-looking cumulus cloud finally arrived, and blotted out the view. A groan, but only a half-hearted one, emerged from the spectators; after all we&#8217;d seen what we&#8217;d come to see. I took in the colors emanating from the different parts of the sky, and then looked west again, waiting for the light to return. A thin red glow touched the horizon. I waited. Suddenly the red began to grow furiously. I yelled &#8220;Il revient!&#8221; &#8212; it is returning! &#8212; and then watched in awe as the reds became pinks, swarmed over us, turned yellow-white&#8230;</p>
<p>And then&#8230; it was daylight again. Normality, or a slightly muted version of it. The magical show was over, heavenly love had been consummated, we who had traveled far had been rewarded. The weather had been kind to us. There was a pause as we savored the experience, and waited for our brains to resume functioning. Then congratulations were passed around as people shook hands and hugged each other. I thanked my Belgian friends, who like me were smiling broadly. They offered me a ride back to town. I almost accepted, but stopped short, and instead thanked them again and told them I somehow wanted to be outside for a while longer. We exchanged addresses, said goodbyes, they drove off.</p>
<p>I started retracing my steps from the previous evening. As I walked back to the town of Rethel in the returning sunshine, the immensity of what I had seen began gradually to make its way through my skin into my blood, making me teary-eyed. I thought about myself, a scientist, educated and knowledgeable about the events that had just taken place, and tried to imagine what would have happened to me today if I had not had<br />
that knowledge and had found myself, unexpectedly, in the Moon&#8217;s shadow.</p>
<p>It was not difficult; I had only to imagine what I would feel if the sky suddenly, without any warning, turned a fiery red instead of blue and began to howl. It would have been a living nightmare. The terror that I would have felt would have penetrated my bones. I would have fallen on my knees in panic; I would have screamed and wept; I would have called on every deity I knew and others I didn&#8217;t know for help; I would have despaired; I would have thought death or hell had come; I would have assumed my life was about to end. The two minutes of darkness, filled with the screams and cries of my neighbors, would have been timeless, maddening. When the Sun just as suddenly returned, I would have collapsed onto the ground with relief, profusely and weepingly thanking all of the deities for restoring the world to its former condition, and would have rushed home to relatives and friends, hoping to find some comfort and solace.</p>
<p>I would have sought explanations. I would have been willing to consider anything: dragons eating the Sun, spirits seeking to punish our village or country for its transgressions, evil and spiteful monsters trying to freeze the Earth, gods warning us of terrible things to come in future. But above all, <em>I could never, never have imagined that </em><em>this brief spine-chilling extinction and transformation of the Sun was a natural </em><em>phenomenon.</em> Nothing so spectacular and sudden and horrifying could have been the work of mere matter. It would once and for all have convinced me of the existence of creatures greater and more powerful than human beings, if I had previously had any doubt.</p>
<p>And I would have been forever changed. No longer could I have entirely trusted the regularity of days and nights, of seasons, of years. For the rest of my life I would have always found myself glancing at the sky, wanting to make sure that all, for the moment, was well. For if the Sun could suddenly vanish for two minutes, perhaps the next time it could vanish for two hours, or two days&#8230; or two centuries. Or forever.</p>
<p>I pondered the impact that eclipses, both solar and lunar, have had throughout human history. They have shaped civilizations. Wars and slaughters were begun and ended on their appearance; they sent ordinary people to their deaths as appeasement sacrifices; new gods and legends were invoked to give meaning to them. The need to predict them, and the coincidences which made their prediction possible, helped give birth to astronomy as a mathematically precise science, in China, in Greece, in modern Europe &#8212; developments without which my profession, and even my entire technologically-based culture, might not exist.</p>
<p>It was an hour&#8217;s walk to Rethel, but that afternoon it was a long journey. It took me across the globe to nations ancient and distant. By the time I reached the town, I&#8217;d communed with my ancestors, reconsidered human history, and examined anew my tiny place in the universe.  If I&#8217;d been a bit calm during totality itself, I wasn&#8217;t anymore. What I&#8217;d seen was gradually filtering, with great potency, into my soul.</p>
<p>I took the train back to Charleville, and slept dreamlessly. The next two days were an opportunity to unwind, to explore, and to eat well. On my last evening I returned to Paris to visit my old haunts. I managed to sneak into the courtyard of the apartment house where I had had a one-room garret up five flights of stairs, with its spartan furnishings and its one window that looked over the roofs of Paris to the Eiffel Tower. I wandered past the old Music Conservatory, since moved to the northeast corner of town, and past the bookstore where I bought so much music. My favorite bakery was still open.</p>
<p>That night I slept in an airport hotel, and the next day flew happily home to the American continent. I never did find my driver&#8217;s license.</p>
<p>But psychological closure came already on the day following the eclipse. I spent that day in Laon, a small city perched magnificently atop a rocky hill that rises vertically out of the French plains. I wandered its streets and visited its sights &#8212; an attractive church, old houses, pleasant old alleyways, ancient walls and gates. As evening approached I began walking about, looking for a restaurant, and I came to the northwestern edge of town overlooking the new city and the countryside beyond. The clouds had parted, and the Sun, looking large and dull red, was low in the sky. I leaned on the city wall and watched as the turning Earth carried me, and Laon, and all of France, at hundreds of miles an hour, intent on placing itself between me and the Sun. Yet another type of solar eclipse, one we call &#8220;sunset.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ruddy disk touched the horizon. I remembered the wispy white mane and the brilliant pink jewels. In my mind the Sun had always been grand and powerful, life-giver and taker, essential and dangerous. It could blind, burn, and kill.  I respected it, was impressed and awed by it, gave thanks for it, swore at it, feared it. But in the strange light of totality, I had seen beyond its unforgiving, blazing sphere, and glimpsed a softer side of the Sun. With its feathery hair blowing in a dark sky, it had seemed delicate, even vulnerable. It is, I thought to myself, as mortal as we.</p>
<p>The distant French hills rose across its face. As it waned, I found myself feeling a warmth, even a tenderness &#8212; affection for this giant glowing ball of hydrogen, this protector of our planet, this lonely beacon in a vast emptiness&#8230; the only star you and I will ever know.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As forecast, the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2017/07/15/lights-in-the-sky-maybe/">cloud of particles from Friday&#8217;s solar flare</a> (the &#8220;coronal mass emission&#8221;, or &#8220;CME&#8221;) arrived at our planet a few hours after my last post, early in the morning New York time. <em>If you&#8217;d like to know how I knew that it had reached Earth, and how I know what&#8217;s going on now, scroll down to the end of this post and I&#8217;ll show you the data I was following, which is publicly available at all times.</em></p>
<p>So far the resulting auroras have stayed fairly far north, and so I haven&#8217;t seen any &#8212; though they were apparently seen last night in Washington and Wyoming, and presumably easily seen in Canada and Alaska. <em>[Caution: sometimes when people say they&#8217;ve been &#8220;seen&#8221;, they don&#8217;t quite mean that; I often see lovely photos of aurora that were only visible to a medium-exposure camera shot, not to the naked eye.]</em>  Or rather, I should say that the auroras have stayed fairly close to the Earth&#8217;s poles; they were also seen in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Russia and Europe have a good opportunity this evening. As for the U.S.? The storm in the Earth&#8217;s magnetic field is still going on, so tonight is still a definite possibility for northern states. Keep an eye out! Look for what is usually a white or green-hued glow, often in swathes or in stripes pointing up from the northern horizon, or even overhead if you&#8217;re lucky.  The stripes can move around quite rapidly.</p>
<p>Now, here&#8217;s how I knew all this.  I&#8217;m no expert on auroras; that&#8217;s not my scientific field at all.   But the U.S. Space Weather Prediction Center at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which needs to monitor conditions in space in case they should threaten civilian and military satellites or even installations on the ground, provides <a href="http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/communities/space-weather-enthusiasts">a wonderful website with lots of relevant data.</a></p>
<p>The first image on the site provides the space weather overview; a screenshot from the present is shown below, with my annotations.  The upper graph indicates a blast of x-rays <em>(a form of light not visible to the human eye)</em> which is generated when the solar flare, the magnetically-driven explosion on the sun, first occurs.  Then the slower cloud of particles (protons, electrons, and other atomic nuclei, all of which have mass and therefore can&#8217;t travel at light&#8217;s speed) takes a couple of days to reach Earth.  It&#8217;s arrival is shown by the sudden jump in the middle graph.  Finally, the lower graph measures how active the Earth&#8217;s magnetic field is.  The only problem with that plot is it tends to be three hours out of date, so beware of that! A &#8220;Kp index&#8221; of 5 shows significant activity; 6 means that auroras are likely to be moving away from the poles, and 7 or 8 mean that the chances in a place like the north half of the United States are pretty good.  So far, 6 has been the maximum generated by the current flare, but things can fluctuate a little, so 6 or 7 might occur tonight.  Keep an eye on that lower plot; if it drops back down to 4, forget it, but it it&#8217;s up at 7, take a look for sure!</p>

<p>Also on the site is data from <a href="http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/ace-real-time-solar-wind">the ACE satellite</a>.  This satellite sits 950 thousand miles [1.5 million kilometers] from Earth, between Earth and the Sun, which is 93 million miles [150 million kilometers] away.  At that vantage point, it gives us (and our other satellites) a little early warning, of up to an hour, before the cloud of slow particles from a solar flare arrives.  That provides enough lead-time to turn off critical equipment that might otherwise be damaged.  And you can see, in the plot below, how at a certain time in the last twenty-four hours the readings from the satellite, which had been tepid before, suddenly started fluctuating wildly.  That was the signal that the flare had struck the satellite, and would arrive shortly at our location.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a wonderful feature of the information revolution that you can get all this scientific data yourself, and not wait around hoping for a reporter or blogger to process it for you.  None of this was available when I was a child, and I missed many a sky show.  A big thank you to NOAA, and to the U.S. taxpayers who make their work possible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For those of you who live in or around Berkshire County, Massachusetts, or know people who do&#8230;</p>
<p>Starting next week I&#8217;ll be giving two free lectures about the LIGO experiment&#8217;s discovery of gravitational waves.  The lectures will be at 1:30 pm on Mondays June 20 and 27, at Berkshire Community College in Pittsfield, MA.  The first lecture will focus on why gravitational waves were expected by scientists, and the second will be on how gravitational waves were discovered, indirectly and then directly.  No math or science background will be assumed.  (These lectures will be similar in style to the ones I gave a couple of years ago concerning the Higgs boson discovery.)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a flyer with the details:  <a href="http://berkshireolli.org/ProfessorMattStrasslerOLLILecturesFlyer.pdf">http://berkshireolli.org/ProfessorMattStrasslerOLLILecturesFlyer.pdf</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scarcely a hundred years after Einstein revealed the equations for his theory of gravity (&#8220;General Relativity&#8221;) on November 25th, 1915, the world today awaits an announcement from the <a href="https://www.advancedligo.mit.edu/">LIGO experiment</a>, where the G in LIGO stands for Gravity. <em>(The full acronym stands for &#8220;Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory.&#8221;)</em> As you&#8217;ve surely heard, the widely reported rumors are that at some point in the last few months, LIGO, recently upgraded to its &#8220;Advanced&#8221; version, finally observed gravitational waves &#8212; ripples in the fabric of space (more accurately, of space-time). These waves, which can make the length of LIGO shorter and longer by an incredibly tiny amount, seem to have come from the violent merger of two black holes, each with a mass <em>[rest-mass!]</em> dozens of times larger than the Sun. Their coalescence occurred long long ago (billions of years) in a galaxy far far away (a good fraction of the distance across the visible part of the universe), but the ripples from the event arrived at Earth just weeks ago. For a brief moment, it is rumored, they shook LIGO hard enough to be convincingly observed.</p>
<p>For today&#8217;s purposes, let me assume the rumors are <em>true</em>, and let me assume also that the result to be announced is actually <em>correct</em>. We&#8217;ll learn today whether the first assumption is right, but the second assumption may not be certain for some months (remember OPERA&#8217;s [<em><a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/neutrinos-faster-than-light/opera-what-went-wrong/">NOT</a></em>] faster-than-light neutrinos  and BICEP2&#8217;s [<em><a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/dust-thou-art-bicep2/">PROBABLY NOT</a></em>] gravitational waves from inflation). We must always keep in mind that any extraordinary scientific result has to be scrutinized and confirmed by experts before scientists will believe it! Discovery is difficult, and a large fraction of such claims &#8212; <strong>large</strong> &#8212; fail the test of time.</p>
<p><strong>What the Big News Isn&#8217;t</strong></p>
<p>There will be so much press and so many blog articles about this subject that I&#8217;m just going to point out a few things that I suspect most articles will miss, especially those in the press.</p>
<p>Most importantly, if LIGO has indeed directly discovered gravitational waves, that&#8217;s exciting of course. <strong><em>But it&#8217;s by no means the most important story here</em></strong>.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because gravitational waves were <strong>already</strong> observed indirectly, quite some time ago, in a system of two neutron stars orbiting each other. This pair of neutron stars, discovered by Joe Taylor and his graduate student Russell Hulse, is interesting because one of the neutron stars is a pulsar, an object whose rotation and strong magnetic field combine to make it a natural lighthouse, or more accurately a radiohouse, sending out pulses of radio waves that can be detected at great distances. The time between pulses shifts very slightly as the pulsar moves toward and away from Earth, so the pulsar&#8217;s motion around its companion can be carefully monitored. Its orbital period has slowly changed over the decades, and the changes are perfectly consistent with what one would expect if the system were losing energy, emitting it in the form of unseen gravitational waves at just the rate predicted by Einstein&#8217;s theory (<a href="http://www.astro.cardiff.ac.uk/research/gravity/resources/hulse_taylor.jpg" target="_blank">as shown in this graph</a>.) For their discovery, Hulse and Taylor received the 1993 Nobel Prize. By now, there are other examples of similar pairs of neutron stars, also showing the same type of energy loss in detailed accord with Einstein&#8217;s equations.</p>
<p><em>A bit more subtle (so you can skip this paragraph if you want), but also more general, is that <strong>some</strong> kind of gravitational waves are inevitable&#8230; inevitable, after you accept Einstein&#8217;s earlier (1905) equations of <strong>special</strong> relativity, in which he suggested that the speed of light is a sort of universal speed limit on everything, imposed by the structure of space-time.  Sound waves, for instance, exist because the speed of sound is finite; if it were infinite, a vibrating guitar string would make the whole atmosphere wiggle back and forth in sync with the guitar string.  Similarly, since effects of gravity must travel at a finite speed, the gravitational effects of orbiting objects must create waves. The only question is the specific properties those waves might have.</em></p>
<p>No one, therefore, should be surprised that gravitational waves exist, or that they travel at the universal speed limit, just like electromagnetic waves (including visible light, radio waves, etc.) No one should even be surprised that the waves LIGO is (perhaps) detecting have properties predicted by Einstein&#8217;s specific equations for gravity; if they were different in a dramatic way, the Hulse-Taylor neutron stars would have behaved differently than expected.</p>
<p>Furthermore, no one should be surprised if waves from a black hole merger have been observed by the Advanced LIGO experiment. This experiment was designed <em>from the beginning,</em> decades ago, so that it could hardly fail to discover gravitational waves from the coalescence of two black holes, two neutron stars, or one of each. We know these mergers happen, and the experts were very confident that Advanced LIGO could find them. The really serious questions were: (a) would Advanced LIGO work as advertised? (b) if it worked, how soon would it make its first discovery? and (c) would the discovery agree in detail with expectations from Einstein&#8217;s equations?</p>
<p><strong>Big News In Scientific Technology</strong></p>
<p>So the first big story is that Advanced LIGO <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>WORKS</strong></span>! This experiment represents one of the greatest technological achievements in human history. Congratulations are due to the designers, builders, and operators of this experiment &#8212; and to the National Science Foundation of the United States, which is LIGO&#8217;s largest funding source. U.S. taxpayers, who on average each contributed a few cents per year over the past two-plus decades, can be proud. And because of the new engineering and technology that were required to make Advanced LIGO functional, I suspect that, over the long run, taxpayers will get a positive financial return on their investment. That&#8217;s in addition of course to a vast scientific return.</p>
<p>Advanced LIGO is not even in its final form; further improvements are in the works. Currently, Advanced LIGO consists of two detectors located 2000 miles (3000 kilometers) apart. Each detector consists of two &#8220;arms&#8221; a few miles (kilometers) long, oriented at right angles, and the lengths of the arms are continuously compared.  This is done using exceptionally stable lasers reflecting off exceptionally perfect mirrors, and requiring use of sophisticated tricks for mitigating all sorts of normal vibrations and even effects of quantum &#8220;jitter&#8221; from the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. With these tools, Advanced LIGO can detect when passing gravitational waves change the lengths of LIGO&#8217;s arms by &#8230; incredibly &#8230; less than one part in a billion trillion (1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000). That&#8217;s an astoundingly tiny distance: a thousand times smaller than the radius of a proton. <em>(A proton itself is a hundred thousand times smaller, in radius, than an atom. Indeed, LIGO is measuring a distance as small as can be probed by the Large Hadron Collider &#8212; albeit with a very very tiny energy, in contrast to the collider.)</em> By any measure, the gravitational experimenters have done something absolutely extraordinary.</p>
<p><strong>Big News In Gravity</strong></p>
<p>The second big story: from the gravitational waves that LIGO has perhaps seen, we would learn that the merger of two black holes occurs, to a large extent, as Einstein&#8217;s theory predicts. The success of this prediction for what the pattern of gravitational waves should be is a far more powerful test of Einstein&#8217;s equations than the mere existence of the gravitational waves!</p>
<p>Imagine, if you can&#8230; Two city-sized black holes, each with a mass [rest-mass!] tens of times greater than the Sun, and separated by a few tens of miles (tens of kilometers), orbit each other. They circle faster and faster, as often, in their last few seconds, as 100 times per second. They move at a speed that approaches the universal speed limit. This extreme motion creates an ever larger and increasingly rapid vibration in space-time, generating large space-time waves that rush outward into space. Finally the two black holes spiral toward each other, meet, and join together to make a single black hole, larger than the first two and spinning at an incredible rate.  It takes a short moment to settle down to its final form, emitting still more gravitational waves.</p>
<p>During this whole process, the total amount of energy emitted in the vibrations of space-time is a few times larger than you&#8217;d get if you could take the entire Sun and (magically) extract all of the energy stored in its rest-mass (E=mc²). This is an immense amount of energy, significantly more than emitted in a typical supernova. Indeed, LIGO&#8217;s black hole merger may perhaps be the most titanic event ever detected by humans!</p>
<p>This violent dance of darkness involves very strong and complicated warping of space and time. In fact, it wasn&#8217;t until 2005 or so that the full calculation of the process, including the actual moment of coalescence, was possible, using highly advanced mathematical techniques and powerful supercomputers!</p>
<p>By contrast, the resulting ripples we get to observe, billions of years later, are much more tame. Traveling far across the cosmos, they have spread out and weakened. Today they create extremely small and rather simple wiggles in space and time. You can learn how to calculate their properties in an advanced university textbook on Einstein&#8217;s gravity equations. Not for the faint of heart, but certainly no supercomputers required.</p>
<p>So gravitational waves are the (relatively) easy part. It&#8217;s the prediction of the merger&#8217;s properties that was the really big challenge, and its success would represent a remarkable achievement by gravitational theorists. And it would provide powerful new tests of whether Einstein&#8217;s equations are in any way incomplete in their description of gravity, black holes, space and time.</p>
<p><strong>Big News in Astronomy</strong></p>
<p>The third big story: If today&#8217;s rumor is indeed of a real discovery, we are witnessing the birth of an entirely new field of science: gravitational-wave astronomy. This type of astronomy is complementary to the many other methods we have of &#8220;looking&#8221; at the universe. What&#8217;s great about gravitational wave astronomy is that although dramatic events can occur in the universe without leaving a signal visible to the eye, and even without creating any electromagnetic waves at all, nothing violent can happen in the universe without making waves in space-time. Every object creates gravity, through the curvature of space-time, and every object feels gravity too. <strong><em>You can try to hide in the shadows, but there&#8217;s no hiding from gravity.</em></strong></p>
<p>Advanced LIGO may have been rather lucky to observe a two-black-hole merger so early in its life. But we can be optimistic that the early discovery means that black hole mergers will be observed as often as several times a year even with the current version of Advanced LIGO, which will be further improved over the next few years. This in turn would imply that gravitational wave astronomy will soon be a very rich subject, with lots and lots of interesting data to come, even within 2016. We will look back on today as just the beginning.</p>
<p>Although the rumored discovery is of something expected &#8212; experts were pretty certain that mergers of black holes of this size happen on a fairly regular basis &#8212; gravitational wave astronomy might soon show us something completely unanticipated. Perhaps it will teach us surprising facts about the numbers or properties of black holes, neutron stars, or other massive objects. Perhaps it will help us solve some existing mysteries, such as those of gamma-ray bursts. Or perhaps it will reveal currently unsuspected cataclysmic events that may have occurred somewhere in our universe&#8217;s past.</p>
<p><strong>Prizes On Order?</strong></p>
<p>So it&#8217;s really not the gravitational waves themselves that we should celebrate, although I suspect that&#8217;s what the press will focus on. Scientists already knew that these waves exist, just as they were aware of the existence of atoms, neutrinos, and top quarks long before these objects were directly observed. The historic aspects of today&#8217;s announcement would be in the successful operation of Advanced LIGO, in its new way of &#8220;seeing&#8221; the universe that allows us to observe two black holes becoming one, and in the ability of Einstein&#8217;s gravitational equations to predict the complexities of such an astronomical convulsion.</p>
<p>Of course all of this is under the assumptions that the rumors are true, and also that LIGO&#8217;s results are confirmed by further observations. Let&#8217;s hope that any claims of discovery survive the careful and proper scrutiny to which they will now be subjected. If so, then prizes of the highest level are clearly in store, and will be doled out to quite a few people, experimenters for designing and building LIGO and theorists for predicting what black-hole mergers would look like. As always, though, the only prize that really matters is given by Nature&#8230; and the many scientists and engineers who have contributed to Advanced LIGO may have already won.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><em>Enjoy the press conference this morning. I, ironically, will be in the most inaccessible of places: over the Atlantic Ocean.  I was invited to speak at a workshop on Large Hadron Collider physics this week, and I&#8217;ll just be flying home. I suppose I can wait 12 hours to find out the news&#8230; it&#8217;s been 44 years since LIGO was proposed&#8230;</em></p>
