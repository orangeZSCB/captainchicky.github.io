										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the concepts that&#8217;s playing a big role in contemporary discussions of the laws of nature is the notion of &#8220;vacua&#8221;, the plural of the word &#8220;vacuum&#8221;. I&#8217;ve just completed <a title="Theories and Vacua" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/theories-and-vacua/" target="_blank">an article about what vacua are, and what it means for a universe to have multiple vacua, or for a theory that purports to describe a universe to predict that it has multiple vacua</a>. In case you don&#8217;t want to plunge right in to that article, here&#8217;s a brief summary of why this is interesting and important.</p>
<p>Outside of physics, most people think of a vacuum as being the absence of air. For physicists thinking about the laws of nature, &#8220;vacuum&#8221; means space that has been emptied of <em>everything</em> &#8212; at least, emptied of <strong><em>everything that can actually be removed</em></strong>. That certainly means removing all particles from it. But even though vacuum implies emptiness, it turns out that empty space isn&#8217;t really that empty. There are always fields in that space, fields like the electric and magnetic fields, the electron field, the quark field, the Higgs field. And those fields are always up to something.</p>
<p>First, all of the fields are subject to &#8220;<a title="Quantum Fluctuations and Their Energy" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/quantum-fluctuations-and-their-energy/" target="_blank">quantum fluctuations</a>&#8221; &#8212; a sort of unstoppable jitter that nothing in our quantum world can avoid.  <em>[Sometimes these fluctuations are referred to as <a title="Virtual Particles: What are they?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/virtual-particles-what-are-they/" target="_blank">&#8220;virtual particles&#8221;; but despite the name, those aren&#8217;t particles</a>.  Real particles are well-behaved, long-lived ripples in those fields; fluctuations are much more random.]</em> These fluctuations are always present, in any form of empty space.</p>
<p>Second, and more important for our current discussion, some of the fields <strong>may have average values that aren&#8217;t zero</strong>. [In our own familiar form of empty space, the <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">Higgs field has a non-zero average value</a>, one that causes many of <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the known elementary particles</a> to acquire a mass (i.e. a <a title="The Two Definitions of “Mass”, And Why I Use Only One" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/more-on-mass/the-two-definitions-of-mass-and-why-i-use-only-one/" target="_blank">rest mass</a>).] And it&#8217;s because of this that the notion of vacuum can have a plural: forms of empty space can differ, even for a single universe, if the fields of that universe can take different possible average values in empty space. If a given universe can have more than one form of empty space, we say that &#8220;it has more than one vacuum&#8221;.</p>
<p>There are reasons to think our own universe might have more than one form of vacuum &#8212; more than just the one we&#8217;re familiar with. It is possible that the Standard Model (the equations used to describe all of <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the known elementary particles, and all the known forces except gravity</a>) is a good description of our world, even up to much higher energies than our current particle physics experiments can probe. Physicists can predict, using those equations, how many forms of empty space our world would have. And their calculations show that our world would have (at least) two vacua: the one we know, along with a second, exotic one, with a much larger average value for the Higgs field. (Remember, this prediction is based on the assumption that the Standard Model&#8217;s equations apply in the first place.)  An electron in empty space would have a much larger mass than the electrons we know and love (and need!)</p>
<p>The future of the universe, and our understanding of how the universe came to be, might crucially depend on this second, exotic vacuum. <a title="Theories and Vacua" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/theories-and-vacua/" target="_blank">Today&#8217;s article</a> sets the stage for future articles, which will provide an explanation of why the vacua of the universe play such a central role in our understanding of nature at its most elemental.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, <a title="BICEP2: New Evidence Of Cosmic Inflation!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/bicep2-new-evidence-of-cosmic-inflation/" target="_blank">yesterday was quite a day</a>, and I&#8217;m still sifting through the consequences.</p>
<p>First things first.  As with all major claims of discovery, <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">considerable caution is advised until the BICEP2 measurement has been verified by some other experiment</span></strong>.   Moreover, even if the measurement is correct, <span style="color:#800080;"><strong>one should not assume that the interpretation in terms of gravitational waves and inflation is correct; this requires more study and further confirmation.</strong></span></p>
<p>The media <strong>is</strong> assuming BICEP2&#8217;s measurement is correct, and that the interpretation in terms of inflation is correct, but leading scientists are not so quick to rush to judgment, and are thinking things through carefully.  Scientists are cautious not just because they&#8217;re trained to be thoughtful and careful but also because <em><strong>they&#8217;ve seen many claims of discovery withdrawn or discredited</strong></em>; discoveries are made when humans go where no one has previously gone, with technology that no one has previously used &#8212; and surprises, mistakes, and misinterpretations happen often.</p>
<p>But in this post, I&#8217;m going to <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">assume</span> <span style="color:#ff9900;">assume</span> <span style="color:#0000ff;">assume</span></strong> that BICEP2&#8217;s results are correct, or essentially correct, and are being correctly interpreted.  Let&#8217;s <strong>assume</strong> that <em>[here&#8217;s <a title="A Primer On Today’s Events" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/a-primer-on-todays-events/" target="_blank">a primer on yesterday&#8217;s result that defines these terms</a>]</em></p>
<ul>
<li>they really have detected &#8220;B-mode polarization&#8221; in the &#8220;CMB&#8221; [Cosmic Microwave Background, the photons (particles of light) that are the ancient, cool glow leftover from <a title="Hot Big Bang" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/hot-big-bang/" target="_blank">the Hot Big Bang</a>]</li>
<li>that this B-mode polarization really is a sign of gravitational waves generated during a brief but dramatic period of <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">cosmic inflation</a> that immediately preceded <a title="Hot Big Bang" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/hot-big-bang/" target="_blank">the Hot Big Bang</a>,</li>
</ul>
<p>Then &#8212; <span style="color:#ff0000;">IF</span> BICEP2&#8217;s results were basically right and were being correctly interpreted concerning inflation &#8212; what would be the implications?</p>
<p>Well&#8230;<strong> <em>Wow&#8230;  </em></strong>They&#8217;d really be quite amazing.<span id="more-7493"></span></p>
<p>Would this story be bigger than the <a title="The Day of the Higgs!!!!  DISCOVERY!!! History Made!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/07/04/the-day-of-the-higgs/" target="_blank">discovery of the Higgs particle</a>?  Certainly <em><strong>at least as</strong></em> big.  To try to compare the two gets us into silly discussions; you can&#8217;t know the long-term implications of a discovery at or near the time it is made.  But the immediate list of implications would certainly be longer.</p>
<p><strong>Some Definitions</strong></p>
<p>Before I start: we&#8217;ll need some definitions, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/some-definitions-for-cosmology/" target="_blank">given in this article</a>, of:</p>
<ul>
<li>A unit of energy called GeV (roughly the mass-energy of a hydrogen atom)</li>
<li>The Planck energy, Planck mass and Planck length (processes involving the Planck energy or mass in a region the size of the Planck length will generally involve both quantum mechanics and gravity [&#8220;quantum gravity&#8221;])</li>
<li>The energy scale associated with dark energy (which is not quite the amount of dark energy &#8212; for one thing, despite the name, dark `energy&#8217; is actually an energy per unit volume.)</li>
</ul>
<p>If any of these is unfamiliar to you, you may want to read <a title="Some Definitions for Cosmology" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/some-definitions-for-cosmology/" target="_blank">that article</a> first and to have it handy, in another tab or window, to serve as a glossary.  You may also want to have my <a title="History of the Universe" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/" target="_blank">History of the Universe</a> or my <a title="A Primer On Today’s Events" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/a-primer-on-todays-events/" target="_blank">BICEP2 Discovery Primer</a> hand.</p>
<p><strong>Implications of BICEP2&#8217;s Discovery &#8212;</strong> <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">IF &#8230; IF &#8230;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">IF IF IF</span></strong> BICEP2&#8217;s measurement is correct, at least roughly, and <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">IF IF IF </span></strong>it is being correctly interpreted, at least roughly, then there&#8217;s a long list of broad implications that I can think of, or that others of my colleagues have pointed out to me in conversations.  Some of them are vague &#8212; areas where the implications are likely to be important but are not yet very clear.  Some of these things were already somewhat implied by the previous experimental successes of the theory of inflation, while some stem directly from BICEP2.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>IF &#8230; IF &#8230;</strong></span></p>
<p>A puzzle that bothered scientists for decades, as to how the observable patch of the universe (i.e. the part that we can actually observe today; the universe may be much, much larger than this &#8212; <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">see here</a>) could be so uniform, would indeed be firmly solved, by a period of <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">cosmic inflation</a>.  The extremely flat geometry of the universe would also now be firmly explained.</p>
<p>We would also have confirmation about how the universe became hot &#8212; about how the Hot Big Bang got started.  The picture would be this: a large amount of <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">dark energy first makes the universe big, via inflation, and then the dark energy turns into energetic particles, making the universe hot (and still expanding, albeit more and more slowly</a> [until <a title="A Nobel Prize That’s No Surprise" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/10/04/a-nobel-prize-thats-no-surprise/" target="_blank">relatively recently</a>]).  Some people like to say that inflation puts the &#8220;Bang&#8221; in &#8220;Big Bang&#8221;, but remember that it also makes the universe flat and uniform and huge (typically much larger than the observable patch) before it heats it up.</p>
<p>The existence of cosmic inflation would itself be another feather in the cap of Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity &#8212; since it is Einstein&#8217;s theory that predicts that the presence of a positive cosmological &#8220;constant&#8221; [not necessarily constant], also known as &#8220;dark `energy&#8217; &#8221; [not really energy, but energy density and negative pressure in just the right combination] actually causes the universe to expand, rather than (as we&#8217;d naively expect from gravity) contract.</p>
<p>And <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">(IF&#8230; IF&#8230;)</span></strong> the confirmation of cosmic inflation would mean that those who pointed it out and its advantages, and developed the idea &#8212; people like Starobinsky, Guth, Steinhardt, Linde &#8212; ought to be able to celebrate (though not all will do so, because they abandoned the idea&#8230;)</p>
<p>Also celebrating would be those who pointed out the possibility of a detectable signal from gravitational waves in the polarization of the CMB, which is what BICEP2 has apparently observed.  I believe these would be Kamionkowsi, Kosowsky, Stebbins, Seljak and Zaldarriaga (but the cosmologists should correct me if I&#8217;m unfair here.)</p>
<p>Were there any doubt left concerning Einstein&#8217;s prediction that gravitational waves exist &#8212; perhaps some leftover worry about the 1993-Nobel-Prize-winning indirect detection of energy carried being off by these waves, via <a href="http://www.astro.cardiff.ac.uk/research/gravity/tutorial/?page=3thehulsetaylor" target="_blank">precision measurements of a pulsar, one of a pair of closely-orbiting neutron stars</a> discovered by Hulse and Taylor &#8212; it would be over.</p>
<p>And if anyone still wasn&#8217;t sure that gravity is due to a spin-two field, not  a spin-zero field, the BICEP2 result would settle the matter; you can&#8217;t get B-mode polarization of the CMB without <a title="A Primer On Today’s Events" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/a-primer-on-todays-events/" target="_blank">combining the spin-two polarization structure of the gravitational waves with Thomson scattering</a>.</p>
<p>If there were any doubt that gravity is controlled, just like everything else, by quantum physics, it would erased; BICEP2&#8217;s observation would imply that just like other fields, which are subject to quantum jitter (i.e., random &#8220;<a title="Quantum Fluctuations and Their Energy" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/quantum-fluctuations-and-their-energy/" target="_blank">fluctuations</a>&#8220;), space and time <em>(somewhat more precisely, the metric that determines distances)</em> undergoes the same type of quantum fluctuations as other fields, fluctuations that <em>any</em> quantum version of Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity would predict.  No details about quantum gravity are needed for this conclusion.</p>
<p><span style="color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">The amount of dark energy required during inflation, in order that BICEP2 could observe this gravitational wave signal, would <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>(IF&#8230; IF&#8230;)</strong></span> be enormous.  The energy scale of dark energy [<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/some-definitions-for-cosmology/" target="_blank">defined here</a>] would be about 10<sup>16</sup> GeV, just about 100 times less than the absolute maximum possible, which is the (reduced) Planck scale.  This need not have been the case!   This energy scale  could have been trillions of times smaller, and yet still given acceptable amounts of inflation of the universe and an acceptable Hot Big BAng.  </span>Amazingly, the dark energy during inflation, if BICEP2 is right, is much larger than it <em>needed</em> to be, and almost as large as it could <em>possibly</em> be!</p>
<p><span style="color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">Moreover, if the energy scale of dark energy [<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/some-definitions-for-cosmology/" target="_blank">defined here</a>] had been just a few times weaker than BICEP2 observes &#8212; 1000 times less than the absolute maximum &#8212; then the gravitational wave signal would have been so faint that it would have been completely drowned out by another process (<a title="A Primer On Today’s Events" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/a-primer-on-todays-events/" target="_blank">lensing of E-mode polarization</a>, the solid red curve on the <a title="BICEP2: New Evidence Of Cosmic Inflation!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/bicep2-new-evidence-of-cosmic-inflation/" target="_blank">first figure here</a>.)  So most of us thought, with this wide range of possibilities, that it was a real long shot that BICEP2, or any future similar experiment, would ever see any signal due to gravitational waves from inflation.  That the gravitational waves would turn out to be large and powerful enough to be observed would be an amazing piece of luck for scientists wanting to understand the universe.  (<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">IF&#8230; IF&#8230;</span></strong>)</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff6600;"><em>[The original version of this paragraph overstated what we&#8217;d know; thanks to my colleagues for pointing out a blunder concerning the heating after inflation.]</em> </span> Also, this would mean we would now have an estimate for how hot the observable patch of the universe could have become <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">after inflation ended and the region containing the observable patch became very hot</a> &#8212; the start of the Hot Big Bang.  The energy scale of the dark energy during inflation determines the maximum possible temperature at the start of the Hot Big Bang, more or less.  To say it another way: after inflation with dark energy of scale 10<sup>16</sup> GeV ended, the universe would have become hot, potentially so hot that the average particle rushing around in the hot dense soup of particles had a motion-energy of 10<sup>16</sup> GeV, though perhaps quite a bit less than this.  That&#8217;s a maximum temperature of as much as 10<sup>29</sup> degrees [yes, that&#8217;s a 1 with 29 zeroes after it!!!]</p>
<p>The Large Hadron Collider&#8217;s data provide direct insights into physics at the energy scale of around 1000 GeV or so.  [The mass-energy mc² of the Higgs particle is 125 GeV.]  The BICEP2 measurement would arguably be our first direct evidence (<span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>IF&#8230; IF&#8230;</strong></span>) concerning physics at higher energy scales than the LHC <em>(though one could argue we have a little information from the existence of neutrino masses.)</em>  And not just a little higher!  Since the scale of the dark energy at inflation is at 10<sup>16</sup> GeV, we&#8217;re talking <strong>10,000,000,000,000 times higher</strong>!!!  We&#8217;ve been trying for years, using various methods, to find evidence concerning how physics works at or near the Planck energy and Planck length.  All previous efforts have come up with nothing; proton decay might have given us insight, but it is too rare if it happens at all; neutrino oscillations haven&#8217;t given a clear pictures; cosmology might have revealed big surprises concerning the Planck energy, but none have previously shown up.  But if BICEP2 is right, then, for the first time, we are seeing phenomena which occurred near this energy scale!</p>
<p>Similarly, data from cosmology has made us very confident that we understand physics in the early universe back to the time when the first <a title="The Nuclei of Atoms: At the Heart of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-nuclei-of-atoms-at-the-heart-of-matter/" target="_blank">atomic nuclei</a> formed during the Hot Big Bang &#8212; a few minutes after the Hot Big Bang started, when the temperature was such that the typical particles had energy of about 0.001 GeV.  And we have had <em>reasonable</em> confidence that we have a decent understanding, using what we&#8217;ve learned about particle physics recently, back to times of a billionth of a second, and temperatures corresponding to an energy of a hundred GeV or so.  But now our understanding may be taking (<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">IF&#8230; IF&#8230;</span></strong>) an enormous leap, back to the very start of the Hot Big Bang, at a temperature corrresponding to an energy of as much as 10<sup>16</sup> GeV, and even earlier, into the frigid inflating universe.</p>
<p>The success of the details of the equations that form the heart of inflationary theory suggests that not only did Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity describe physics at very early times and very high energy scales, the basic principles of quantum field theory worked back then too.  It could easily have been imagined &#8212; and many have imagined, with concrete ideas backed up with equations &#8212; that there might be important principles that we are unaware of, or modifications of the ones we know, that would give very different predictions from standard inflationary theory.  So far, there&#8217;s no sign of that at all.  BICEP2&#8217;s result (<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">IF&#8230; IF&#8230;</span></strong>) would be yet another sign that despite having done all our particle physics and gravity measurements at much lower energy scales and longer distances, those accessible to the LHC and to our previous experiments, we&#8217;ve actually understood the principles that govern the behavior of phenomena at much, much higher energy scales and much shorter distances!</p>
<p>The energy scale inferred from BICEP2&#8217;s measurement, 100 times smaller than the Planck energy &#8212; 10<sup>16</sup> GeV or so &#8212; has appeared in particle physics before!  If you take the three non-gravitational forces of nature &#8212; <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force and the electromagnetic force</a> &#8212; and you first consider <a title="The Known Particles — If The Higgs Field Were Zero" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/the-known-particles-if-the-higgs-field-were-zero/" target="_blank">how they are rearranged when the Higgs field is turned off, into strong nuclear, weak isospin, and hypercharge forces</a> &#8212; and then you look at <a title="The Strengths of the Known Forces" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-forces-of-nature/the-strength-of-the-known-forces/" target="_blank">how the strengths of the forces drift</a> as you study them at shorter and shorter distances and higher and higher energies, you find the forces all become about the same strength at an energy scale of about 10<sup>16</sup> GeV or so.  This is called &#8220;unification of coupling constants&#8221; (i.e. force strengths) &#8212; or, originally and more ambitiously, &#8220;grand unification&#8221;, a grander notion that the three non-gravitational forces are actually manifestations of just one type of force.  <em>[Unification of that unified force with gravity is yet another question; that&#8217;s what string theory might do, though string theory does not require grand unification be a separate process from the unification with gravity.]</em>  Originally, back around 1980, inflation was imagined to be associated with grand unification, and if so, would have an energy scale of about &#8230; yes, 10<sup>16</sup> GeV or so.  But that idea died out long ago as people learned more about both unification and inflation.  Yet now we must wonder: could that part of the original idea, in some vague way, have actually been right?</p>
<p>Over the years, scientists have invented a plethora of variations on how inflation might have, in detail, taken place.  BICEP2&#8217;s observation of a gravitational wave signature would sweep away most of them, leaving just a few.  (More will be invented in coming months, though!)  It also would sweep away some alternatives to inflation and many speculative ideas for how the universe might behave, or might at least have behaved at earlier times.  Despite &#8220;tension&#8221; (meaning mild disagreement) between BICPS2s current data and the Planck satellite&#8217;s data, a rather simple observable patch of universe, with rather simple laws of nature and a rather simple form of inflation, are consistent with what we know.</p>
<p>One of the variants of inflation that would be excluded by BICEP2&#8217;s data is the notion (admittedly long-shot anyway) that actually the Higgs field could play the role of the inflaton after all.   It turns out that no observably large gravitational wave signal would be expected if that were true.</p>
<p>BICEP2&#8217;s result would represent the first time that, without any theoretical speculation about quantum gravity, an experiment has <strong>forced</strong> us to consider processes involving physics at the Planck scale, where quantum gravity is important.  Specifically, for a variant of inflation to give such a large gravitational wave signal <em>relative</em> to the size of the other non-uniformities in the cosmic microwave background, the Planck energy scale becomes important.  The inflaton field, which (by definition) is the field whose stored &#8220;<a title="The Energy That Holds Things Together" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/the-energy-that-holds-things-together/" target="_blank">potential energy</a>&#8221; <strong>is</strong> the dark energy, must change by an amount close to or a bit larger than the Planck energy scale. <em>[Sorry for the necessary technical-speak here. </em><em>This whole business is inherently confusing for non-experts.  The dark energy <strong>may change or may not change at all</strong> while the inflaton field is changing; that&#8217;s a separate question.  What it means for a field like an inflaton to change by the Planck energy scale is that if a particle interacted with the inflaton field as strongly as it possibly could (the way the electron interacts with the Higgs field, but stronger), then as the inflaton field changed by an amount comparable to the Planck energy scale, the particle&#8217;s mass would change by an amount comparable to the Planck mass.]</em></p>
<p>An extremely simple possibility for inflation that would still be consistent with all the data <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">(IF&#8230; IF&#8230;)</span></strong> is just to have a spin-zero field (a bit like the <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">Higgs field</a>, but with important differences &#8212; no weak nuclear force effects, for instance) which has a mass and no substantial interactions with any other fields.  This is a model introduced by Andrei Linde; it&#8217;s amazingly simple.  Could it really be correct?</p>
<p>Among the other very simple ideas that are likely to feature prominently in discussions of the near future are ones involving a &#8220;pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson&#8221;, of a type often called an &#8220;axion&#8221;.  <em>[I wrote a little about this in the paragraph just below the figure within <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/03/26/cosmic-conflation-the-higgs-the-inflaton-and-spin/" target="_blank">this post about the Planck satellite and what it means for variants of inflation.</a>]</em>  One of the variants of inflation that is most consistent with both the Planck satellite and BICEP2  <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>(IF&#8230; IF&#8230;)</strong></span> is an idea called &#8220;natural inflation&#8221;, from 1990, due to Katherine Freese, Joshua Frieman and Angela Olinto.  [Here&#8217;s a <a href="http://ccdb5fs.kek.jp/cgi-bin/img/allpdf?199010350" target="_blank">pdf of the paper</a>.] Such a field has the feature that it is periodic (i.e., if you change it by enough, it comes back to itself, the way an angle that can only range from 0 to 2π.)  It also has the feature that its interactions with all other fields are rather weak.  When this field varies a lot, the dark energy associated with it varies by quite a bit less&#8230; so the field could vary by something approaching the Planck scale yet the energy scale of the dark energy could stay rather constant, at one percent of the Planck energy.</p>
<p>In order for this idea to really be consistent with quantum gravity, it might require some modification, of the sort was introduced in 2008 by Liam McAllister, Eva Silverstein, and Alexander Westphal, in which the axion is periodic with a larger range than you&#8217;d naively expect.  <em>[They did this work in the context of string theory, but I don&#8217;t believe that string theory specifically is necessary for the idea to work; it might work in other consistent quantum gravity theories, if there are any.]  </em>Expect to hear much more about axions.  [By the way, it&#8217;s long been suggested that dark matter itself could be made from a type of axion&#8230; but presumably not the same one&#8230;]</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">One last one which is the weakest of the set&#8230; In </span><a style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;" title="What if the Large Hadron Collider Finds Nothing Else?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/07/what-if-the-large-hadron-collider-finds-nothing-else/" target="_blank">a recent article</a><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">, I pointed out that if the Higgs particle discovered at the LHC turns out to be of the simplest possible type &#8212; a &#8220;</span><a style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;" title="The Standard Model Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/" target="_blank">Standard Model Higgs</a><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">&#8221; &#8212; then because this is &#8220;</span><a style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;" title="Naturalness and the Standard Model" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/naturalness/" target="_blank">unnatural</a><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">&#8221; <em>(in the sense of &#8220;highly non-generic&#8221;)</em> it might call into question fundamental conceptual issues, perhaps even the whole framework of quantum field theory.  But BICEP2&#8217;s measurement would seem to support the framework of quantum field theory in a world of three smooth spatial dimensions up to very high scales and very short distances, so that line of thinking would be disfavored. </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;color:#ff0000;"><strong>(IF&#8230; IF&#8230;) </strong></span><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">Of course, measurements of the Higgs particle are still in the early days &#8212; at this point we can only say the Higgs particle is roughly &#8220;</span><a style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;" title="From “Higgs-like Particle” to “Standard Model-like Higgs”" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/03/15/from-higgs-like-particle-to-standard-model-like-higgs/" target="_blank">Standard-Model-like</a><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">&#8221;</span><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;"> in type &#8212;  and maybe the Higgs will turn out to be more complex, or other new particles will show up at the LHC, possibly rendering the discussion moot.  But (for reasons I outlined in my Santa Barbara talk two weeks ago) having only the Standard Model, with the Higgs field turned on <em>just a little</em>, plus quantum gravity and an inflaton field (and plus something to explain dark matter and neutrino masses) would pose many grave conceptual problems, ones that anthropic reasoning would not address.  <em>[Experts: Anthropic reasoning can be used to argue why the cosmological constant might be small; it can be used to argue why there is a hierarchy between the Planck mass and the proton and electron masses; but it cannot easily be used, without huge and problematic assumptions, to argue why one would find just the Standard Model at the LHC, with one light scalar Higgs field and nothing else new.]</em> So I would tend to see the BICEP2 result <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>(IF&#8230; IF&#8230;)</strong></span> as a (rather weak!!) argument slightly in favor of supersymmetry and grand unification, with supersymmetry just a little out of reach of the LHC for some reason, or modified in some way to make it harder to observe than expected.  <em>[Experts: &#8220;mini-split&#8221; supersymmetry, which preserves quantum field theory, with unification of coupling constants at the grand unified energy scale, starts to look better than something more radical.]</em></span></p>
<p>Colleagues: what have I left out?  Eventually this post will be stored on this site as a reference article, so I&#8217;d like to make it complete.</p>
<p><strong>Final Remarks</strong></p>
<p>One more time I must remind you that we&#8217;re still some time away from trusting the BICEP2 result, and quite a long time from trusting the interpretation of the result in terms of inflation.   All of the implications I&#8217;ve mentioned are therefore provisional.   But the list is impressive, and there are probably more I have forgotten to mention, or are known to others but not to me, along with still others that haven&#8217;t yet been noticed by anyone.  So I don&#8217;t yet know if BICEP2&#8217;s measurement is right, or if inflation occurred and if it created the signal they observe, but I do know this: <strong><em>there&#8217;s a lot at stake</em></strong>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In <a title="A 100 TeV Proton-Proton Collider?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/03/a-100-tev-proton-proton-collider/">my last post</a>, I expressed the view that a particle accelerator with <a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/" target="_blank">proton</a>-proton collisions of (roughly) 100 <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/" target="_blank">TeV</a> of energy, significantly more powerful than the currently operational <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC] that helped scientists <a title="Discovery of the Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-discovery-of-the-higgs/" target="_blank">discover</a> the <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">Higgs particle</a>, is an obvious and important next steps in our process of learning about the elementary workings of nature. And I described how we don&#8217;t yet know whether it will be an exploratory machine or a machine with a clear scientific target; it will depend on what the LHC does or does not discover over the coming few years.</p>
<p>What will it mean, for the 100 TeV collider project and more generally, if the LHC, having made possible the discovery of the Higgs particle, provides us with no more clues?  Specifically, over the next few years, hundreds of tests of the Standard Model (the equations that govern <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the known particles and forces</a>) will be carried out in measurements made by the ATLAS, CMS and LHCb experiments at the LHC. Suppose that, as it has so far, the Standard Model passes every test that the experiments carry out? In particular, suppose the Higgs particle discovered in 2012 appears, after a few more years of intensive study, to be, as far the LHC can reveal, a <a title="The Standard Model Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/" target="_blank">Standard Model Higgs</a> &#8212; the simplest possible type of Higgs particle?</p>
<p>Before we go any further, let&#8217;s keep in mind that we already know that the Standard Model isn&#8217;t all there is to nature. The Standard Model does not provide a consistent theory of gravity, nor does it explain <a title="Neutrinos" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/" target="_blank">neutrino</a> masses, <a title="Questions and Answers About Dark Matter post-LUX" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/31/questions-and-answers-about-dark-matter-post-lux/" target="_blank">dark matter</a> or &#8220;dark energy&#8221; (also known as <a title="Why You Can’t Easily Dismiss the Cosmological Constant Problem" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/08/30/why-you-cant-easily-dismiss-the-cosmological-constant-problem/" target="_blank">the cosmological constant</a>). Moreover, many of its features are just things we have to accept without explanation, such as the strengths of the forces, the existence of &#8220;three generations&#8221; (i.e., that <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">there are two heavier cousins of the electron, two for the up quark and two for the down quark</a>), the values of the masses of the various particles, etc. However, even though the Standard Model has its limitations, it is possible that everything that can actually be measured at the LHC &#8212; which cannot measure neutrino masses or directly observe dark matter or dark energy &#8212; will be well-described by the Standard Model. What if this is the case?</p>
<p><strong>Michelson and Morley, and What They Discovered</strong></p>
<p>In science, giving strong evidence that something <strong>isn&#8217;t</strong> there can be as important as discovering something that <strong>is</strong> there &#8212; and it&#8217;s often harder to do, because you have to thoroughly exclude all possibilities. <em>[It&#8217;s very hard to show that your lost keys are <strong>nowhere</strong> in the house &#8212; you have to convince yourself that you looked <strong>everywhere</strong>.]</em> A famous example is the case of <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1907/michelson-bio.html" target="_blank">Albert Michelson</a>, in his two experiments (one in 1881, a second with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Morley" target="_blank">Edward Morley</a> in 1887) trying to detect the &#8220;ether wind&#8221;.</p>
<p>Light had been shown to be a wave in the 1800s; and like all waves known at the time, it was assumed to be a wave <strong>in</strong> something material, just as sound waves are waves <strong>in</strong> air, and ocean waves are waves <strong>in</strong> water. This material was termed the &#8220;luminiferous ether&#8221;. As we can detect our motion through air or through water in various ways, it seemed that it should be possible to detect our motion through the ether, specifically by looking for the possibility that light traveling in different directions travels at slightly different speeds.  This is what Michelson and Morley were trying to do: detect the movement of the Earth through the luminiferous ether.</p>
<p>Both of Michelson&#8217;s measurements failed to detect any ether wind, and did so expertly and convincingly. And for the convincing method that he invented &#8212; an experimental device called an interferometer, which had many other uses too &#8212; <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1907/press.html" target="_blank">Michelson won the Nobel Prize in 1907</a>. Meanwhile the failure to detect the ether drove both <a href="http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/987/1/Michelson.pdf" target="_blank">FitzGerald and Lorentz to consider radical new ideas about how matter might be deformed</a> as it moves through the ether. Although these ideas weren&#8217;t right, they were important steps that Einstein was able to re-purpose, even more radically, in his 1905 equations of special relativity.</p>
<p>In Michelson&#8217;s case, <strong><em>the failure to discover the ether was itself a discovery</em></strong>, recognized only in retrospect: a discovery that the ether did not exist. <em>(Or, if you&#8217;d like to say that it <strong>does</strong> exist, which some people do, then what was discovered is that the ether is utterly unlike any normal material substance in which waves are observed; no matter how fast or in what direction you are moving relative to me, <strong>both of us are at rest</strong> relative to the ether.)</em> So one must not be too quick to assume that a lack of discovery is actually a step backwards; it may actually be a huge step forward.</p>
<p><strong>Epicycles or a Revolution?</strong></p>
<p>There were various attempts to make sense of Michelson and Morley&#8217;s experiment.   Some interpretations involved  tweaks of the notion of the ether.  Tweaks of this type, in which some original idea (here, the ether) is retained, but adjusted somehow to explain the data, are often referred to as &#8220;epicycles&#8221; by scientists.   <em>(This is analogous to the way <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferent_and_epicycle" target="_blank">an epicycle was used by Ptolemy to explain the complex motions of the planets in the sky</a>, in order to retain an earth-centered universe; the sun-centered solar system requires no such epicycles.)</em> A tweak of this sort <strong><em>could</em></strong> have been the right direction to explain Michelson and Morley&#8217;s data, but as it turned out, it was not. Instead, the non-detection of the ether wind required something more dramatic &#8212; for it turned out that waves of light, though at first glance very similar to other types of waves, were in fact extraordinarily different. <em><strong>There simply was no ether wind for Michelson and Morley to detect</strong></em>.</p>
<p>If the LHC discovers nothing beyond the Standard Model, we will face what I see as a similar mystery.  <a title="Naturalness and the Standard Model" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/naturalness/" target="_blank">As I explained here</a>, the Standard Model, with no other particles added to it, is a consistent but extraordinarily <em>&#8220;unnatural&#8221;</em> (i.e. extremely non-generic) example of <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part 2)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/24/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-2/" target="_blank">a quantum field theory</a>.  This is a big deal. Just as nineteenth-century physicists deeply understood both the <em>theory</em> of waves and many specific <em>examples of waves in nature </em> and had excellent reasons to expect a detectable ether, twenty-first century physicists understand quantum field theory and naturalness both from the theoretical point of view <strong>and</strong> from many examples in nature, and have very good reasons to expect particle physics to be described by a natural theory.  (Our examples come both from condensed matter physics [e.g. metals, magnets, fluids, etc.] and from particle physics [e.g. the physics of <a title="What’s a Hadron?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-hadron-as-in-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">hadrons</a>].) Extremely <strong><em>unnatural</em></strong> systems &#8212; that is, physical systems described by quantum field theories that are <strong><em>highly non-generic</em></strong> &#8212; simply have not previously turned up in nature&#8230; which is just as we would expect from our theoretical understanding.</p>
<p><em>[Experts: As I emphasized in <a href="http://online.kitp.ucsb.edu/online/joefest_c14/" target="_blank">my Santa Barbara talk last week</a>, appealing to anthropic arguments about the hierarchy between gravity and the other forces does <strong>not</strong> allow you to escape from the naturalness problem.]</em></p>
<p>So what might it mean if an unnatural quantum field theory describes all of the measurements at the LHC? It may mean that our understanding of particle physics requires an epicyclic change &#8212; a <em>tweak</em>.  The implications of a tweak would potentially be minor. A tweak might only require us to keep doing what we&#8217;re doing, exploring in the same direction but a little further, working a little harder &#8212; i.e. to keep colliding protons together, but go up in collision energy a bit more, from the LHC to the 100 TeV collider. For instance, perhaps the Standard Model is supplemented by additional particles that, rather than having masses that put them within reach of the LHC, as would inevitably be the case in a <em><strong>natural</strong></em> extension of the Standard Model (here&#8217;s <a title="Supersymmetry — What Is It?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/supersymmetry-what-is-it/" target="_blank">an example</a>), are just <em>a little bit</em> heavier than expected. In this case the world would be <em>somewhat</em> unnatural, but not too much, perhaps through some relatively minor accident of nature; and a 100 TeV collider would have enough energy per collision to discover and reveal the nature of these particles.</p>
<p>Or perhaps a tweak is entirely the wrong idea, and instead our understanding is fundamentally amiss. Perhaps another Einstein will be needed to radically reshape the way we think about what we know.  A<span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;"> dramatic rethink is both more exciting and more disturbing. It was an intellectual challenge for 19th century physicists to imagine, from the result of the Michelson-Morley experiment, that key clues to its explanation would be found in seeking violations of Newton&#8217;s equations for <a title="How Did Einstein Do It?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/mass-and-energy/how-did-einstein-do-it/" target="_blank">how energy and momentum depend on velocity</a>. (The first experiments on this issue were carried out in 1901, but definitive experiments took another 15 years.) It was an even greater challenge to envision that the <a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Le_Verrier.html" target="_blank">already-known unexplained shift in the orbit of Mercury</a> would also be related to the Michelson-Morley (non)-discovery, as Einstein, in trying to adjust Newton&#8217;s gravity to make it consistent with the theory of special relativity, showed in 1913. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">My point is that the experiments that were needed to properly interpret Michelson-Morley&#8217;s result</span></p>
<ul>
<li>did not involve trying to detect motion through the ether,</li>
<li>did not involve building even more powerful and accurate interferometers,</li>
<li>and were not immediately obvious to the practitioners in 1888.</li>
</ul>
<p>This should give us pause. We might, if we continue as we are, be heading in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>Difficult as it is to do, we have to take seriously the possibility that <strong>if</strong> (and remember this is still <em><strong>a very big &#8220;if&#8221;</strong></em>) the LHC finds only what is predicted by the Standard Model, the reason may involve a significant reorganization of our knowledge, perhaps even as great as relativity&#8217;s re-making of our concepts of space and time. Were that the case, it is possible that higher-energy colliders would tell us nothing, and give us no clues at all. An exploratory 100 TeV collider is not guaranteed to reveal secrets of nature, any more than a better version of Michelson-Morley&#8217;s interferometer would have been guaranteed to do so. It may be that a completely different direction of exploration, including directions that currently would seem silly or pointless, will be necessary.</p>
<p>This is not to say that a 100 TeV collider isn&#8217;t needed!  It <em>might</em> be that all we need is a tweak of our current understanding, and then such a machine <em>is</em> exactly what we need, and will be the only way to resolve the current mysteries.  Or it might be that the 100 TeV machine is just what we need to learn something revolutionary.  But we also need to be looking for other lines of investigation, perhaps ones that today would sound unrelated to particle physics, or even unrelated to any known fundamental question about nature.</p>
<p>Let me provide one example from recent history &#8212; one which did not lead to a discovery, but still illustrates that this is not all about 19th century history.</p>
<p><strong>An Example</strong></p>
<p>One of the great contributions to science of Nima Arkani-Hamed, Savas Dimopoulos and Gia Dvali was to observe <em>(in <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9803315" target="_blank">a 1998 paper</a> I&#8217;ll refer to as ADD, after the authors&#8217; initials)</em> that no one had ever excluded the possibility that we, and all the particles from which we&#8217;re made, can move around freely in three spatial dimensions, but are stuck (as it were) as though to the corner edge of a thin rod &#8212; a rod as much as one millimeter wide, into which only gravitational fields (but not, for example, electric fields or magnetic fields) may penetrate.  Moreover, they emphasized that the presence of these extra dimensions might explain why gravity is so much weaker than the other known forces.</p>

<p>Given the incredible number of experiments over the past two centuries that have probed distances vastly smaller than a millimeter, the claim that there could exist millimeter-sized unknown dimensions was amazing, and came as a tremendous shock &#8212; certainly to me. At first, I simply didn&#8217;t believe that the ADD paper could be right.  But it was.</p>
<p>One of the most important immediate effects of the ADD paper was to generate a strong motivation for a new class of experiments that could be done, rather inexpensively, on the top of a table. If the world were as they imagined it might be, then Newton&#8217;s (and Einstein&#8217;s) law for gravity, which states that the force between two stationary objects depends on the distance r between them as 1/r², would increase faster than this at distances shorter than the width of the rod in Figure 1.  This is illustrated in Figure 2.</p>

<p>These experiments are not easy &#8212; gravity is very, very weak compared to electrical forces, and lots of electrical effects can show up at very short distances and have to be cleverly avoided. But some of the best experimentalists in the world figured out how to do it (see <a href="http://www.npl.washington.edu/eotwash/sr" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~aharonk/gravity.html" target="_blank">here</a>). After the experiments were done, Newton/Einstein&#8217;s law was verified down to a few hundredths of a millimeter.  If we live on the corner of a rod, as in Figure 1, it&#8217;s much, much smaller than a millimeter in width.</p>
<p>But it <strong><em>could</em></strong> have been true. And if it had, it might not have been discovered by a huge particle accelerator. It might have been discovered in these small inexpensive experiments <em>that could have been performed years earlier</em>. The experiments weren&#8217;t carried out earlier<span style="color:#333333;"> mainly because no one had pointed out quite how important they could be.</span></p>
<p><strong>Ok Fine; What Other Experiments Should We Do?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">So what are the non-obvious experiments we should be doing now or in the near future?  Well, if I had a really good suggestion for a new class of experiments, I would tell you &#8212; or rather, I would write about it in a scientific paper. (Actually, I <em>do</em> know of <a title="Unexpected Decays of the Higgs Particle: What We Found" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/02/11/non-standard-model-higgs-particle-decays-what-we-found/">an important class of measurements</a>, and I <em>have</em> written <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4992" target="_blank">a scientific paper</a> about them; but these are measurements to be done at the LHC, and don&#8217;t involve a entirely new experiment.)  Although I&#8217;m thinking about these things, I do not yet have any good ideas.  Until I do, or someone else does, this is all just <strong><em>talk</em></strong> &#8212; and talk does not impress physicists. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">Indeed, you might object that my remarks in this post have been almost without content, and possibly without merit.  I agree with that objection.</span></p>
<p>Still, I have some reasons for making these points. In part, I want to highlight, for a wide audience, the possible historic importance of what might now be happening in particle physics. And I especially want to draw the attention of young people. There have been experts in my field who have written that non-discoveries at the LHC constitute a &#8220;nightmare scenario&#8221; for particle physics&#8230; that there might be nothing for particle physicists to do for a long time. But I want to point out that on the contrary, not only may it not be a nightmare, it might actually represent an extraordinary opportunity. Not discovering the ether opened people&#8217;s minds, and eventually opened the door for Einstein to walk through. And if the LHC shows us that particle physics is not described by a natural quantum field theory, it may, similarly, open the door for a young person to show us that our understanding of quantum field theory and naturalness, while as intelligent and sensible and precise as the 19th century understanding of waves, does not apply unaltered to particle physics, and must be significantly revised.</p>
<p>Of course the LHC is still a young machine, and it may still permit additional major discoveries, rendering everything I&#8217;ve said here moot. But young people entering the field, or soon to enter it, should not assume that the experts necessarily understand where the field&#8217;s future lies. Like FitzGerald and Lorentz, even the most brilliant and creative among us might be suffering from our own hard-won and well-established assumptions, and we might soon need the vision of a brilliant young genius &#8212; perhaps a theorist with a clever set of equations, or perhaps an experimentalist with a clever new question and a clever measurement to answer it &#8212; to set us straight, and put us onto the right path.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the challenges for a person trying to explain physics to the non-expert &#8212; and for non-experts themselves &#8212; is that scientific language and concepts are often frustratingly confusing. Often two words are used for the same thing, sometimes <a title="Virtual Particles: What are they?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/virtual-particles-what-are-they/">words are used that are fundamentally misleading</a>, and often <a title="Matter and Energy: A False Dichotomy" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/matter-and-energy-a-false-dichotomy/">a single word is used for two very different but related concepts</a>. You&#8217;d think we&#8217;d clear this stuff up, but no one has organized a committee dedicated to streamlining and refining our terminology.</p>
<p>A deeply unfortunate case, the subject of today&#8217;s post, is the word &#8220;mass&#8221;. Mass was confusing before Einstein, and then Einstein came along and (accidentally) left the word mass with two different definitions&#8230; both of which you&#8217;ll see in first-year university textbooks. (Indeed, this confusion even extended to physicists more broadly, causing the famous particle physicist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev_Okun" target="_blank">Lev Okun</a> to <a href="http://www.itep.ru/theor/persons/lab180/okun/em_3.pdf" target="_blank">make this issue into a cause celebre&#8230;</a>) And it all has to do with how you interpret E = mc² &#8212; the only equation everybody knows &#8212; which relates <em>the energy stored in an object</em> to the <em>mass of the object</em> times the <em>square</em> of the <em>universal speed limit</em> c, also known as &#8220;the speed of light&#8221;.</p>
<p>Here are the two possible interpretations of this equation. <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Modern particle physicists </strong>(including me)<strong> only use the first interpretation.</strong></span> The purpose of this post is to alert you to this fact, and to point you to <a title="The Two Definitions of “Mass”, And Why I Use Only One" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/more-on-mass/the-two-definitions-of-mass-and-why-i-use-only-one/" target="_blank">an article where I explain more carefully why we do it this way</a>.<span id="more-6242"></span></p>
<p><strong>Interpretation 1.</strong> <span style="color:#008000;">E = mc² is true only for an object that isn&#8217;t moving.</span> For an object that is moving, E is <em><strong>greater</strong></em> than mc². <em>Energy and mass are not at all the same thing</em>; an object&#8217;s energy can change when its motion changes, but its mass never changes. This notion of mass is sometimes called &#8220;rest mass&#8221; (since it&#8217;s related to the energy stored in the object when it is &#8220;at rest&#8221;) or &#8220;invariant mass&#8221; (since it doesn&#8217;t change when it is moving.)</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation 2.</strong> <span style="color:#800080;">E = mc² is <em><strong>always</strong></em> true, for both stationary and moving objects.</span> This can be viewed as saying <em>energy and mass are essentially the same thing</em>. [Recall that in interpretation 1, they are <strong>not at all</strong> the same thing.] Since the energy of a moving object is larger than when it is stationary, that means, similarly, that its mass is larger when it is moving than when it is stationary. This notion of mass is sometimes called &#8220;relativistic mass&#8221;, in honor of Einstein&#8217;s revolutionary notions of relativity.</p>
<p>To sum up &#8212; <span style="color:#800080;"><em>relativistic mass</em></span> depends on how fast an object is moving, but <span style="color:#008000;"><em>invariant mass/rest mass</em></span> is the same whether an object is moving or not; you can see this in the figure below.  Which one of these should we call &#8220;mass&#8221;, with no modifier?  Unfortunately, that&#8217;s up to the user.</p>

<p>Fortunately, in daily life, these two concepts are almost identical, because most objects we observe in daily life much more slowly than c, in which case their rest mass and relativistic mass are nearly identical, as you can see in the figure. But particle physicists and nuclear physicists and astronomers, among others, often have to be more precise. And when you&#8217;re reading an article or book about particles or nuclei or astronomy in which &#8220;mass&#8221; plays an important role, you will often need to know which of these two interpretations is being used by the author!</p>
<p>Einstein, in his early years, contributed to the second interpretation, perhaps inadvertently.  But later he made clear statements <em>(most notably in a letter to Lincoln Barnett, which I can&#8217;t find in full on the web, but which is quoted widely)</em> in favor of the first  interpretation. Not that Einstein&#8217;s opinion particularly matters; in science we respect our elders, but we do not slavishly follow them, the way people used to follow Aristotle. We come to a conclusion based on what we know, and often we know things that weren&#8217;t known to the previous generations.  So why do particle physicists today choose interpretation 1? I&#8217;ll give you a couple of quick hints as to why, and if you want to learn more, you can <a title="The Two Definitions of “Mass”, And Why I Use Only One" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/more-on-mass/the-two-definitions-of-mass-and-why-i-use-only-one/" target="_blank">read my article on the matter</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#008000;">If you use the first definition,</span></span>
<ul>
<li><strong>all</strong> photons <em>(particles of light)</em> have zero mass,</li>
<li>all <a title="Atoms: Their Inner Workings" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/atoms-building-blocks-of-molecules/atoms-their-inner-workings/" target="_blank">hydrogen atoms</a> have the <strong>same</strong> mass: 0.938 <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#008000;">GeV</span></a>/c²</li>
<li>all <a title="Electrons: On the Outskirts of Atoms" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/electrons-on-the-outskirts-of-atoms/" target="_blank">electrons</a> have a mass which much <strong>smaller</strong> than that of a hydrogen atom.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="color:#800080;"><span style="color:#800080;">If you use the second definition,</span></span>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>no</strong></em> photons have zero mass (because all photons have energy)</li>
<li>every hydrogen atom has a <strong><em>different</em></strong> mass, depending on how fast it is moving; and</li>
<li>any particular electron may have a <strong><em>smaller or larger</em></strong> mass than any given hydrogen atom, depending on how fast each of them is moving. <em> [For instance, an electron emitted by a decaying <a title="Decays of the Standard Model Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/decays-of-the-standard-model-higgs/" target="_blank">Higgs particle</a> has a larger mass than the hydrogen atoms in your body (at least from your point of view).]</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So with the second interpretation, you can&#8217;t even say which types of particles have larger masses than other types, and it is impossible for any type of particle to be massless.  This is very inconvenient &#8212; one might even say, ridiculous &#8212; for doing particle physics.</p>
<p>Additional subtle but profound mathematical reasons <span style="color:#888888;"><em>[having to do with the &#8220;hyperbolic geometry of space-time&#8221;, if you must know]</em></span> support the first interpretation, as hinted at in <a title="Mass and Energy" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/mass-and-energy/" target="_blank">this article on mass and energy</a>, which shows how energy, momentum and mass are related by elegant equations if you use the first interpretation.</p>
<p>Anyway, as long as you are aware of the existence of these two different interpretations, you will usually be able to tell which one is in use by an author. <strong><em> <span style="color:#ff0000;">On this website, the <span style="color:#008000;">first interpretation</span> is always used.</span></em></strong><span style="color:#ff0000;"><span style="color:#000000;">    If you would like to learn more about why particle physicists choose the first interpretation, <a title="The Two Definitions of “Mass”, And Why I Use Only One" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/more-on-mass/the-two-definitions-of-mass-and-why-i-use-only-one/" target="_blank">click here for my more detailed article</a>.</span></span></p>

			<media:title type="html">The two interpretations of  what &#034;mass&#034; means.  The first (in green) is that mass is something that does not change with speed -- often called &#034;invariant mass&#034; or &#034;rest mass&#034;, it is used by particle physicists.  The other, &#034;relativistic mass&#034;, is just energy divided by c-squared. Note the two are almost identical at small velocities and so are essentially equal in daily life.</media:title>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes, it was funny, as I hope you enjoyed in my <a title="Particles are People Too" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/12/01/particles-are-people-too/">post from Saturday</a>; but really, when we step back and look at it, something is dreadfully wrong and quite sad.  Somehow TIME magazine, fairly reputable on the whole, in the process of reporting the nomination of a particle<em> (the Higgs Boson; here&#8217;s <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">my FAQ about it</a> and here&#8217;s <a title="Why the Higgs Particle Matters" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/why-the-higgs-particle-matters/" target="_blank">my layperson&#8217;s explanation of why it is important</a>)</em> as a Person (?) of the Year, <a href="http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2128881_2128882_2129214,00.html" target="_blank">explained the nature of this particle with a disastrous paragraph of five astoundingly erroneous sentences</a>.   Treating this as a &#8220;teaching moment&#8221; <em>(yes, always the professor &#8212; can&#8217;t help myself)</em> I want to go through those sentences carefully and fix them, not to string up or further embarrass the journalist but to be useful to my readers.  So that&#8217;s coming in a moment.</p>
<p>But first, a lament.</p>
<p>Who&#8217;s at fault here, and how did this happen?  There&#8217;s plenty of blame to go around; some lies with the journalist, who would have been wise to run his prose past a science journalist buddy; some lies with the editors, who didn&#8217;t do basic fact checking, even of the non-science issues; some lies with a public that (broadly) doesn&#8217;t generally care enough about science for editors to make it a priority to have accurate reporting on the subject.  But there&#8217;s a history here.  How did it happen that we ended up a technological society, relying heavily on the discoveries of modern physics and other sciences over the last century, and yet we have a public that is at once confused by, suspicious of, bored by, and unfamiliar with science?   I think a lot of the blame also lies with scientists, who collectively over generations have failed to communicate both what we do and why it&#8217;s important &#8212; and why it&#8217;s important for journalists not to misrepresent it.<span id="more-5067"></span></p>
<p>On good days I like to think that blogging is a step forward, which allows for much broader, more accurate and more rapid communication with the public and with journalists than was previously possible.  There are many good websites and blogs that can address the physics of the Higgs particle far better than any science magazine or newspaper science section could hope to: these include (but are by no means not limited to) <a href="http://resonaances.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Resonaances</a>, <a href="http://www.quantumdiaries.org/" target="_blank">Quantum Diaries</a>, <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/" target="_blank">Cosmic Variance</a>, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/life-and-physics" target="_blank">Life and Physics</a>, <a href="http://www.science20.com/quantum_diaries_survivor" target="_blank">A Quantum Diaries Survivor</a>, <a href="http://motls.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">The Reference Frame</a>, <a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/" target="_blank">Not Even Wrong</a>, <a href="http://blog.vixra.org/" target="_blank">Vixra</a>, &#8230;  there must be a dozen others. Even though I often disagree with some of the more polemical and extreme bloggers about details of the science &#8212; what is or isn&#8217;t excluded by data, how data ought to be analyzed, what the important issues in the field are &#8212; all of these bloggers are expert enough to get most of the particle physics right most of the time, and readers, by reading the various blogs, can get something of a balanced point of view and figure out what&#8217;s mainstream sensible and what&#8217;s polemic overstatement. <em> [Of course, there are other blogs out there are packed with misleading information about the basic science, but that&#8217;s an issue for another day.] </em> But even collectively, we&#8217;re simply not reaching enough of the public at large yet.  We saw that in the craziness about faster-than-light neutrinos last year.  We&#8217;re seeing it this year with the Higgs particle.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m not alone among the bloggers and book authors in feeling that if the journalist or editors at TIME had ever once read one &#8212; <em>just one</em> &#8212; of the many short articles we&#8217;ve all written for laypersons explaining something about the Higgs particle <em>(e.g., <a title="Why the Higgs Particle Matters" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/why-the-higgs-particle-matters/" target="_blank">Why the Higgs Particle Matters</a>)</em> many of the errors in the TIME piece would never have happened.  How can we collectively get a wider readership, at least among journalists?</p>
<p>Ok.  Here we go.  Here&#8217;s what TIME said, and what&#8217;s wrong with it.  Read it and weep.  Or laugh.  Or both.</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">Take a moment to thank this little particle for all the work it does, because without it,</span></p>
<ul>
<li><a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">The <strong>field</strong>, not the particle, does the job; the particle is just a ripple in that field.</a>  No reason to thank the Higgs particle, except in that it is very useful for providing deeper insight into the nature of the Higgs field.  (Or <em>field<span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>s</strong></span></em>; we don&#8217;t yet know there&#8217;s only one.) But the journalist is making a very common mistake.  As I wrote in <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">the Higgs FAQ</a>, &#8220;&#8230;the Higgs particle gets all the attention, while the poor Higgs field labors in obscurity, protecting the universe from catastrophe but getting none of its deserved credit…&#8221;  And this mis-attribution of credit is, I fear, largely scientists&#8217; fault, because of glib shortcuts taken in explaining things too briefly to journalists and to the public<em>.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">you’d be just inchoate energy without so much as a bit of mass.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Well, this is so wrong it&#8217;s hard to say how it&#8217;s wrong.  Of course, you wouldn&#8217;t <strong>be</strong>, so it&#8217;s hard to say exactly <strong>what</strong> you&#8217;d be.  What would really happen is that your electrons would no longer form atoms with the protons and neutrons in your atomic nuclei, so you&#8217;d explode.  Without the Higgs field, atoms would not form and there could be no ordinary matter; BUT protons and neutrons, composite particles made out of massless elementary ones, would still have a mass.  And since protons and neutrons make up most of <em><strong>your</strong></em> mass, it&#8217;s not true at any level that you would simply turn into massless things.  And massless things aren&#8217;t the same as energy, anyway; see below.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">What’s more, the same would be true for the entire universe.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s not clear what the writer means here, but it&#8217;s certainly not correct. Within the universe, <a title="Why the Higgs and Gravity are Unrelated" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/10/15/why-the-higgs-and-gravity-are-unrelated/" target="_blank">many things with mass, including protons and neutrons but also black holes, and probably dark matter, would maintain their masses even with no Higgs field</a>.  And the mass of the universe <em>(no matter how you might define it, which is not so easy)</em> certainly wouldn&#8217;t shift from non-zero to zero if the Higgs field were turned off.  So this statement doesn&#8217;t make sense.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">It was in the 1960s</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Correct! (phew)</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">that Scottish physicist</span></p>
<ul>
<li>English (according to all my sources, including his <a href="http://www.ph.ed.ac.uk/higgs/peter-higgs" target="_blank">CV</a> and Wikipedia &#8212; didn&#8217;t they do any fact-checking at TIME? this wasn&#8217;t difficult&#8230;); works in Scotland</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">Peter Higgs</span></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/jul/04/higgs-boson-nobel-prize-headache" target="_blank">and also Englert and Brout, and also Guralnik, Hagen and Kibble </a>(and actually the history is a lot more subtle even than that); please give these other folks <em>some</em> credit, by saying &#8220;Higgs and others&#8221; or something like that!</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">first posited the existence of a particle</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Field! and then Higgs noted (slightly later) that it would have a particle as a consequence.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">that causes energy to make the jump to matter.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The Higgs field does not cause energy to become matter.  Both the language and the meaning are wrong; the writer has fallen into classic traps that I&#8217;ve written about extensively (see <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/mass-and-energy/" target="_blank">this link</a> and <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/matter-and-energy-a-false-dichotomy/" target="_blank">this link</a>).  What happens when the Higgs field becomes non-zero is that certain types of massless elementary particles end up having some mass.   What&#8217;s wrong with the writer&#8217;s language? <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/matter-and-energy-a-false-dichotomy/" target="_blank">Energy is not the same thing as massless particles</a>; rather, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/mass-and-energy/" target="_blank">energy is something that particles can <em>have</em>, whether they have mass or not</a>.  And &#8220;mass&#8221; and &#8220;matter&#8221; are not the same thing; <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/matter-and-energy-a-false-dichotomy/" target="_blank">&#8220;matter&#8221;, in fact, is ambiguous as a term</a>, but generally is related to the notion of <em>ordinary material</em> made from atoms or their constituents, while <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/mass-and-energy/" target="_blank">mass is again something that particles can <em>have</em>, whether those particles make up matter or not</a>.  <em>[For example, top anti-quarks are not part of matter, <a title="Matter and Energy: A False Dichotomy" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/matter-and-energy-a-false-dichotomy/" target="_blank">by most definitions of &#8220;matter&#8221;</a>, but they certainly have mass! all of it obtained from the Higgs field(s).)]</em> I often feel that physicists do a bad job of making these points clear to the public, and I fear we&#8217;re largely responsible for these confusions, along with high-school science classes.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">But it was not until last summer that a team of researchers at Europe’s Large Hadron Collider — Rolf Heuer, Joseph Incandela and Fabiola Gianotti —</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Oh wow.  TIME OUT!!!   This is bad.  Thousands of people on two huge teams (CMS and ATLAS) worked for many, many years to make this possible; hundreds were directly involved in the discovery.  Yet somehow the writer imagines that this all was carried out by three people?!?  The latter two are the currently-<em>elected spokespersons</em> for their teams, but they are not somehow responsible for the majority of the work (for although they are very highly respected scientists, they couldn&#8217;t possibly have the time!) and the third, Rolf Heuer, who currently directs the CERN laboratory, does not do research on the Large Hadron Collider at all!   What is sad about this is that erases the contribution of many great scientists, and it completely loses sight of what an incredible and historic collaborative effort was involved in this discovery.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">at last sealed the deal and in so doing finally fully confirmed Einstein’s general theory of relativity.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Oh woe.  Oh woe.  Oh calamity.  SO wrong.  Definitely the most disastrous mistake of them all.  There&#8217;s <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/10/15/why-the-higgs-and-gravity-are-unrelated/" target="_blank">zero/zilch/nada/no-way/nothing to connect the Higgs story with gravity</a>, which is what Einstein&#8217;s general relativity is about.  The discovery of the Higgs particle changes nothing in our understanding of general relativity.  And hey, general relativity is <em>already</em> fairly well confirmed (though one never stops testing a theory for weak points; it took hundreds of years to find a weak point in Newton&#8217;s.)  Repeat:<a title="Why the Higgs and Gravity are Unrelated" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/10/15/why-the-higgs-and-gravity-are-unrelated/" target="_blank"> there is no obvious or direct connection between the Higgs field, or its particle, and gravity</a>!  Discovery of the Higgs particle merely represents (partial) confirmation of the idea that the masses of various elementary particles come from a Higgs field (or fields).</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">The Higgs — as particles do —</span></p>
<ul>
<li>as <a title="Most Particles Decay — Yet Some Don’t!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/why-do-particles-decay/most-particles-decay-yet-some-dont/" target="_blank"><em>most but fortunately not all</em></a> particles do &#8212; I suspect the writer meant this, but it&#8217;s not so clear&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">immediately decayed to more-fundamental particles,</span></p>
<ul>
<li>No! This is a common and <em>very natural</em> misconception; the writer is by no means alone in being confused on this point.   Our ordinary daily-life intuition would suggest that fundamental (or &#8220;elementary&#8221;, a term I much prefer) objects should not be able to fall apart into other fundamental objects &#8212; that the ability to fall apart is limited to objects that are composites constructed out of other objects, the way a wall can fall apart into its constituent bricks.  But for particles, <strong><em>decay is not a falling-apart</em></strong>.  It is a transformation.  And so yes, fundamental objects can in fact decay/disintegrate/transform into two or more objects that are just as fundamental (or even may be <em>less</em>-fundamental!)  What is required to make the decay possible is that <a title="Most Particles Decay — Yet Some Don’t!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/why-do-particles-decay/most-particles-decay-yet-some-dont/" target="_blank">the sum of their masses of the decay products is smaller than the mass of the decaying object; a few other rules must be obeyed as well</a>.  Other rules determine whether a particular decay pattern is <em>likely</em>, but that gets more technical.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">but the scientists would surely be happy to collect any honors or awards in its stead.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>True.  But I really think they&#8217;d be a little embarrassed about this award.  I don&#8217;t think a particle should be Person of the Year.  That&#8217;s just plain silly.  Discovery of the Year?  Maybe!</li>
</ul>
<p>Hahaha; ok, we&#8217;ve had our laughs.  But now what I want to know is what more we scientists can do to change a bad situation.  Although the writer and the editors at TIME made avoidable serious errors in this little paragraph, it&#8217;s by no means entirely their fault that this happened. Is there more that we &#8212; scientists and journalists &#8212; can do to open up the communication channels?  Can we work to eliminate some of the inaccurate short-cuts in what we scientists tell the public, often via the journalism community?  How can we make this kind of trust-eroding mistake less likely?</p>
<p>Suggestions welcome.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the questions I get most often from my readers is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Since gravity pulls on things proportional to their mass, and since the Higgs field is responsible for giving everything its mass, there obviously must be a deep connection between the Higgs and gravity&#8230; right?</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s a very reasonable guess, but &#8212; it turns out to be completely wrong. The problem is that this statement combines a 17th century notion of gravity, long ago revised, with an overly simplified version of a late-20th century notion of where masses of various particles comes from.  I&#8217;ve finally produced <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">the Higgs FAQ version 2.0</a>, intended for non-experts with little background in the subject, and as part of that, I&#8217;ve answered this question.  But since the question is so common, I thought I&#8217;d also put the answer in a post of its own.</p>
<p>As preface, let me bring out my professorial training and correct the question above with a red pen:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">Since gravity pulls on things proportional to their <span style="color:#ff0000;"><del>mass</del> <em>to a combination of their energy and momentum</em></span>, and since the Higgs field is responsible of giving <span style="color:#ff0000;"><del>everything</del> <em><strong>not</strong> everything, just the known elementary particles excepting the Higgs particle itself </em><del>its</del></span><del></del> mass, there <span style="color:#ff0000;"><del>obviously must be a deep connection</del></span> between the Higgs and gravity&#8230; <span style="color:#ff0000;"><del>right?</del></span><em><span style="color:#ff0000;"> wrong</span>.</em></span></li>
</ul>
<p>Now let me explain these corrections one by one.<span id="more-4727"></span></p>
<p>When you first learn about gravity in school, you learn Newton&#8217;s law: that the force of gravity between two objects, one of mass M<sub>1</sub> and one of mass M<sub>2</sub>, has a strength proportional to the product M<sub>1</sub> M<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>But that was true before Einstein. It turns out that Newton&#8217;s law needs to be revised: the Einsteinian statement of the law is (roughly) that for two objects that are <em>slow-moving</em> (i.e. their speed relative to one another is much less than c, the speed of light) and have energy E<sub>1</sub> and E<sub>2</sub>, the gravitational force between them has a strength proportional to the product E<sub>1</sub> E<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>How are these two statements, the Newtonian and the Einsteinian, consistent? They are consistent because Einstein and his followers established that for any ordinary object, the relation between its energy E, momentum p and mass M [sometimes called &#8220;rest mass&#8221;, but just called `mass&#8217; by particle physicists] is</p>
<ul>
<li>E<sup>2</sup> = (p c)<sup>2</sup> + (M c<sup>2</sup>)<sup>2</sup></li>
</ul>
<p>For a slow-moving object, p ≈ Mv (where v is the object&#8217;s velocity) and pc ≈ Mvc is much smaller than Mc<sup>2</sup>. And therefore</p>
<ul>
<li>E<sup>2</sup> ≈ (M c<sup>2</sup>)<sup>2</sup>    (i.e., E ≈ M c<sup>2</sup> for slow objects)</li>
</ul>
<p>Since planets, moons, and artificial satellites all move with velocities well below 0.1% of c relative to each other and to the sun, the gravitational forces between them are proportional to</p>
<ul>
<li>E<sub>1</sub> E<sub>2</sub> ≈ M<sub>1</sub> M<sub>2</sub> c<sup>4</sup></li>
</ul>
<p>And since c is a constant, for such objects Einstein&#8217;s law of gravity and Newton&#8217;s law of gravity are completely consistent; the force law is proportional to the product of the energies <strong>and</strong> to the product of the masses, because the two are proportional to one another.</p>
<p>But for objects that have high speeds relative to one another, or for objects subject to extremely strong gravitational pulls (which will quickly develop high speeds if they don&#8217;t have them already), the Einsteinian law of gravity involves a complicated combination of momentum and energy, in which mass does not explicitly appear. This is why Einstein&#8217;s version of gravity even pulls on things like light, which is made from photons that have no mass at all. (And it is why gravitational waves &#8212; waves in space and time, massless just like light &#8212; can be formed by objects that are orbiting one another.) Simply put, the Einsteinian view of gravity (now reasonably well confirmed by experiment) differs significantly from the Newtonian view, and in particular, it is not mass but energy and momentum which are primary. And all objects, not matter what they are made from or how they are moving from your point of view, have energy &#8212; so everything in the universe exerts a gravitational effect on everything else. We say &#8220;gravity is a <strong>universal</strong> force&#8221; (here the term is not referring not to the <em>universe</em> but to the notion of <strong><em>universality</em></strong> &#8212; of complete generality.)</p>
<p>What about the Higgs field being the source for all mass in the universe? This statement, though you will often find it in the press or in glib articles written for the public, is <strong>false</strong>.</p>
<p>What is the true statement? Well, here is a list of <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the elementary particles</a> that we know about so far. The massless ones are</p>
<ul>
<li>photons, gluons, gravitons <em>(the latter presumed to exist)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>while the ones with mass are</p>
<ul>
<li>W and Z particles</li>
<li>quarks: top, bottom, charm, strange, up, down</li>
<li>charged leptons: electrons, muons, taus</li>
<li>neutrinos: three types (at least two and probably all three with small masses)</li>
<li>the <a title="A New Era Dawns" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/07/05/a-new-era-dawns/" target="_blank">recently discovered new particle</a> with a mass of 125 GeV/c<sup>2</sup> (which I will assume for now is a Higgs particle of some type)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now it is true that the W and Z particles, the quarks, the charged leptons and the neutrinos must get their mass from a Higgs field. It&#8217;s not possible for them to have masses any other way. <em>But this is not true of the Higgs particle itself.</em></p>
<p><strong>The mass of the Higgs particle does not entirely come from the Higgs field!</strong></p>
<p>Where does its mass come from? Oh, that&#8217;s a long story that ends in a question rather than an answer. I will try to explain it someday. For now, suffice it to say that the mass of the Higgs particle does not have a single, simple, understood source, and the curious feature is that its mass is so small &#8212; this is one aspect of the enormous puzzle called the <a title="The Hierarchy Problem" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/" target="_blank">hierarchy problem.</a></p>
<p>But in any case, the Higgs field is <strong>not</strong> the universal giver of mass to elementary particles. The Higgs particle itself gets its mass, at least in part, from elsewhere. And it probably isn&#8217;t alone. It is very possible that dark matter is made from particles, and these too probably get at least part of their mass from another source. Dark matter is believed by most physicists and astronomers to be the majority of the matter in the universe; it is believed to provide the majority of the mass of the Milky Way Galaxy that we inhabit. The Higgs field likely provides little of that mass.</p>
<p>Other things get their masses from sources other than the Higgs particle. The majority of the mass of an atom is its nucleus, not its lightweight electrons on the outside. And nuclei are made from <a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/" target="_blank">protons and neutrons</a> &#8212; bags of imprisoned or &#8220;confined&#8221; quarks, antiquarks and gluons. These quarks, antiquarks and gluons go roaring around inside their little prison at very high speeds, and the masses of the proton and neutron are as much due to those energies, and to the energy that is needed to trap the quarks etc. inside the bag, as it is due to the masses of the quarks and antiquarks contained within the bag. So <strong>the proton&#8217;s and neutron&#8217;s masses do not come predominantly from the Higgs field.</strong> [<em>Experts: There is a subtlety here, having to do with how the Higgs field affects the confinement scale; but even when it is accounted for, the statement remains essentially true.]</em> So the mass of the earth, or the mass of the sun, would change, but not enormously, if there were no Higgs field&#8230; assuming they could hold together at all, which would not be true of the earth.</p>
<p>And black holes, which are some of the most massive objects in the universe, holding court at the centers of most galaxies, can in principle be made entirely from massless things. You can make a black hole entirely out of photons, in principle. In practise most black holes are made from ordinary matter, but ordinary matter&#8217;s mass is mostly from atomic nuclei, and as we just noted, that doesn&#8217;t come entirely from the Higgs field.</p>
<p>No matter how you view it, <strong><em>the Higgs field is not the universal giver of mass to things in the universe</em></strong>: not to ordinary atomic matter, not to dark matter, not to black holes. To most known fundamental particles, yes &#8212; and it is crucial in ensuring that atoms exist at all. But there would be just as much interesting gravitational physics going on in the universe if there were no Higgs field. There just wouldn&#8217;t be any atoms, or any people to study them.</p>
<p>Finally, you can ask more technically whether, in the equations that physicists study, there is any mathematical connection between gravity and the Higgs field. The answer is no. Gravitational fields have spin 2 and are described as part of space and time; they interact with all particles and fields in nature. The Higgs field, which has spin 0, only interacts directly with elementary particles and fields that also participate in the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces.</p>
<p>So &#8212; the guess that the Higgs has something to do with gravity is natural for a non-expert, but I am afraid it is naive; it comes from misunderstanding both</p>
<ol>
<li>the Higgs field, which is not universal: it gives masses to most of the known elementary particles but not to the Higgs particle itself, and not to protons and neutrons, dark matter (most likely), or black holes,</li>
<li>and Einstein&#8217;s gravity, which is universal and has to do with energy and momentum but not mass directly, and most certainly does pull on protons and neutrons, dark matter and black holes even though their masses don&#8217;t come entirely from the Higgs field.</li>
</ol>
<p>It&#8217;s really true: despite appearances at first glance, the relation between gravity and the Higgs is just skin deep.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apologies to those who&#8217;ve been asking questions: I&#8217;ve been away from the website for a few days <em>(family matters)</em> and have not been able to keep up with comments.  I will try to catch up over the coming day or two.</p>
<p>But I do have two pieces of good news.</p>
<p>First, I gave a public lecture over the weekend, on-line, called &#8220;The Quest for the Higgs&#8221;, which I believe many of my readers will find at the right level.  Because of some technical difficulties with the sound recording, I didn&#8217;t immediately recommend that you listen; but those problems are now fixed and the sound is pretty good.  The audio is to be found <a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/virtually-speaking-science/2012/09/08/prof-matt-strassler-the-quest-for-the-higgs-particle" target="_blank">here at BlogTalkRadio, through the Virtually Speaking Science series</a>; on that website, there&#8217;s a link to the slides accompanying the talk, or you can just <a href="http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/~strassler/QuestHiggs.pdf" target="_blank">click here</a> to get them.  <span style="color:#888888;"><em>[Note the slides are under copyright; please ask permission before reproducing or using ideas you find therein.]</em>  </span></p>
<p>Second, the long-awaited final article in the series on Particles and Fields (with a little math) has arrived.</p>
<ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;ve just gotten back from vacation, perhaps after days or weeks seeking the perfect wave, well, what a treat awaits! So much reading to do, about such interesting things. I&#8217;m writing a set of articles, intended for the reader who has once-upon-a-time seen beginning physics (what we in the U.S. would call &#8220;freshman physics&#8221;, or even a good &#8220;advanced placement physics&#8221; course pre-university) with the goal of explaining what fields and particles are. Five of the seven or eight articles are done; four appeared over the last two weeks, and now there&#8217;s a new one:</p>
<ol>
<li><a title="1. Ball on a Spring (Classical)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/fields-and-their-particles-with-math/ball-on-a-spring-classical/">Ball on a Spring (Classical)</a></li>
<li><a title="2. Ball on a Spring (Quantum)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/fields-and-their-particles-with-math/ball-on-a-spring-quantum/" target="_blank">Ball on a Spring (Quantum)</a></li>
<li><a title="3. Waves (Classical Form)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/fields-and-their-particles-with-math/waves-classical-form/" target="_blank">Waves (Classical Form)</a></li>
<li><a title="4. Waves (Classical Equation of Motion)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/fields-and-their-particles-with-math/waves-classical-equation-of-motion/" target="_blank">Waves (Classical Equation of Motion)</a></li>
<li><a title="5. Waves (Quantum)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/fields-and-their-particles-with-math/5-waves-quantum/" target="_blank">Waves (Quantum)</a> &#8212; <span style="color:#ff0000;">the new one.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>After this: an article on Fields, and then one on Particles, and maybe one more with some follow-up information.  And then, with this set complete, I&#8217;ll move on to another series of articles, about how the Higgs field works&#8230;</p>
