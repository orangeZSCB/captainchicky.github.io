										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://lhcb-public.web.cern.ch/lhcb-public/">LHCb experiment</a> at the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/">Large Hadron Collider</a> is dedicated mainly to the study of mesons <em>[objects made from a quark of one type, an anti-quark of another type, plus many other particles]</em> that contain <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/">bottom quarks</a> (hence the `b&#8217; in the name).  But it also can be used to study many other things, including mesons containing <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/">charm quarks</a>.</p>
<p>By examining large numbers of mesons that contain a charm quark and an up anti-quark (or a charm anti-quark and an up quark) and studying carefully how they <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/why-do-particles-decay/most-particles-decay-why/">decay</a>, the LHCb experimenters have discovered a new example of violations of <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/c-p-t-and-their-combinations/">the transformations known as CP</a> <em>(C: exchange of particle with anti-particle; P: reflection of the world in a mirror)</em>, of the sort that have been previously seen in mesons containing strange quarks and mesons containing bottom quarks.  Here&#8217;s <a href="https://home.cern/news/press-release/physics/lhcb-sees-new-flavour-matter-antimatter-asymmetry">the press release</a>.</p>
<p>Congratulations to LHCb!  This important addition to our basic knowledge is consistent with expectations; CP violation of roughly this size is predicted by the formulas that make up the Standard Model of Particle Physics.  However, our predictions are very rough in this context; it is sometimes difficult to make accurate calculations <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/protons-and-neutrons/">when the strong nuclear force</a>, which holds mesons (as well as protons and neutrons) together, is involved.  So this is a real coup for LHCb, but not a game-changer for particle physics.  Perhaps, sometime in the future, theorists will learn how to make predictions as precise as LHCb&#8217;s measurement!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Almost all the news on neutrinos in the mainstream press this past few months was about <a title="OPERA: The First Few Days" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/neutrinos-faster-than-light/opera-the-first-few-days/" target="_blank">the OPERA experiment, and a possible violation of Einstein&#8217;s foundational theory of relativity</a>. That the experiment <a title="OPERA: What Went Wrong" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/neutrinos-faster-than-light/opera-what-went-wrong/" target="_blank">turned out to be wrong</a> didn&#8217;t surprise experts. But one of the concerns that scientists have about how this story turned out and was reported in the press is that perhaps many non-experts may get the impression that science is so full of mistakes that you can&#8217;t trust it at all. That would be a very unhappy conclusion &#8212; not just unhappy but in fact a very dangerous conclusion, at least for anyone who would like to keep their economy strong, their planet well-treated and their nation well-defended.</p>
<p>So it is important to balance the OPERA mini-fiasco with another hot-off-the-presses neutrino story that illustrates why, even though mistakes in individual scientific experiments are common, collective mistakes in science are rare. A discipline such as physics has intrinsic checks and balances that significantly reduce the probability of errors going unrecognized for long. In the story I&#8217;m about to relate, one can recognize how and why scientists start to come to consensus.  Though quite suspicious of any individual experiment, scientists generally take a different view of a group of experiments that buttress one another.</p>
<p>The context of this story, though much less revolutionary than a violation of Einstein&#8217;s speed limit, still represents a milestone in our understanding of neutrinos, which has been advancing very rapidly over the past fifteen years or so. When I was a starting graduate student in the late 1980s, almost all we knew about neutrinos was that there were at least three types and that they were much lighter than electrons, and perhaps massless. Today we know much, much more about neutrinos and how they behave. And in just the last few months and weeks and days, one of the missing entries in the Encyclopedia Neutrinica appears to have been filled in.<span id="more-3276"></span></p>
<p><strong>The Question</strong></p>
<p>What&#8217;s in question isn&#8217;t so easy to explain; it&#8217;s a tricky bit involving neutrino oscillations.  I wrote a pedagogical article on neutrino types and neutrino oscillations (<a title="Neutrino Types and Neutrino Oscillations" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/neutrino-types-and-neutrino-oscillations/">click here if you want to read it in its entirety</a>), which I recommend you read if you want to understand in a bit more detail what I&#8217;m about to say.  Here I&#8217;m going to make a long story way too short, by simply saying that you can classify the three different types of neutrinos in two different ways.  In the &#8220;weak-type&#8221; classification, the three neutrinos are named &#8220;electron-neutrino&#8221;, &#8220;muon-neutrinos&#8221; and &#8220;tau-neutrinos&#8221;.  Their anti-particles are called anti-neutrinos with the same prefixes.  The names are given according to whether they appear in processes involving electrons, or muons, or taus (or their anti-particles). (<a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">Click here for a reminder about what electrons, muons and taus are</a>.) In particular, if an anti-neutrino is emitted in a process involving an electron, that anti-neutrino is called an <strong><em>electron-antineutrino</em></strong>; if the process instead involves a muon, then the anti-neutrino is a <strong><em>muon-antineutrino</em></strong>.</p>
<p>The physics question that is the subject of this article is the following: as an electron-antineutrino travels along on its own, can it convert (or &#8220;<strong>oscillate</strong>&#8221;) into a muon-antineutrino or tau-antineutrino?  (Or can the reverse process occur, with, say, a muon-neutrino or antineutrino converting to an electron-neutrino or anti-neutrino?)  Certain types of neutrino oscillations have previously been observed, in the context of various types of neutrinos traveling through the sun or through the earth &#8212; but not this particular one.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m oversimplifying quite a bit here, but the full story is long and rather technical.  A very small bit of the technical stuff: In the equations that physicists use for neutrinos, a quantity appears that for historical reasons is called θ<sub>13</sub>.  If it is zero, then electron-antineutrinos will remain as they are.  If it is not zero, then they will &#8220;oscillate&#8221;.  (Again, <a title="Neutrino Types and Neutrino Oscillations" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/neutrino-types-and-neutrino-oscillations/" target="_blank">click here for my article describing what oscillation means in this context</a>.)  So when you read other people&#8217;s articles about this question, you will often see it phrased as asking whether θ<sub>13</sub> is or isn&#8217;t zero.</p>
<p>How could you figure out, through an experiment, whether this type of oscillation occurs?   The trick is to create very large numbers of electron-antineutrinos (for instance, in a nuclear reactor such as one finds in a nuclear power plant). Next, set up a detector, a certain distance away, that is able to detect  electron-antineutrinos (but it won&#8217;t be able to detect the other types, for technical reasons having to do with the low energy carried by anti-neutrinos from a reactor.)  Not that it will detect very many; most of the anti-neutrinos will pass right through the detector, and indeed right through the entire earth, unobserved.  That&#8217;s because neutrinos and anti-neutrinos are unaffected by the <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">electromagnetic force or the strong nuclear force, and can interact with matter only through the weak nuclear force</a>, which is very weak indeed in these contexts <em>(and by gravity, which is ridiculously weak and of no consequence here.)</em>  But because there are <em>so many</em> anti-neutrinos produced by a reactor, a small but measurable number will <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/how-one-detects-neutrinos/" target="_blank">hit something inside a suitably designed detector</a>, allowing them to be observed.</p>
<p>Because the way electron-antineutrinos interact with matter via the weak nuclear force is very well understood, we can predict very accurately how many of them from the reactor would be observed in the detector if they do <strong>not</strong> oscillate.  If oscillation <em>does</em> occur, then fewer will be observed than expected, because a fraction of the electron-antineutrinos, having converted into another type of antineutrino, will be unobservable by the detector.</p>
<p>Actually, the best way to carry out this measurement is not quite the way I just described. What you really want to do is measure the number of electron-antineutrinos observed in <em><strong>two</strong></em> (or more) detectors, located at different distances from the same reactor; see Figure 1. That way, even if you&#8217;ve made a mistake in your understanding of the reactor, or of your detector technology, it won&#8217;t matter; when you take the ratio of how many antineutrinos your <strong>nearby</strong> detector observes compared to how many your <strong>farther</strong> detector observes, those mistakes will cancel out and won&#8217;t affect your measurement of whether oscillation is absent or present, and thus of whether θ<sub>13</sub> is zero or not.</p>

<p><strong>The Answers</strong></p>
<p>In the last few months and weeks, several different experiments have reported on measurements relevant to this question. All of them are finding that <strong>θ<sub>13</sub> is not zero</strong>, and all are consistent with θ<sub>13</sub> being something like 0.16 radians (which is about 9 degrees &#8212; small, but clearly not zero.)  That number may move around a bit with more data, but is very unlikely to drop below 0.08 radians.</p>
<p>The first dramatic evidence was presented in early March, from the <a href="http://dayawane.ihep.ac.cn/twiki/bin/view/Public/" target="_blank">Daya Bay experiment based in China</a> &#8212; a reactor experiment similar to but a bit more elaborate than the sketch shown in Figure 1.  <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.1669" target="_blank">Their result</a>, quite convincing by itself, disagrees with the hypothesis of zero oscillation by more than 5 standard deviations, an amount that by the standards of particle physics convincingly rules out the possibility that θ<sub>13</sub> =0.</p>
<p>But in saying &#8220;this is convincing&#8221;, I am <strong><em>assuming they didn&#8217;t make any mistakes</em></strong>. Should we believe this neutrino experiment more than we believed OPERA? After all, OPERA claimed a 6 standard deviation result <em>(though <a title="OPERA’s Presentation: My Initial Comments" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/neutrinos-faster-than-light/opera-the-first-few-days/operas-presentation-my-initial-comments/" target="_blank">I complained it should have been more like 4</a>, if they&#8217;d been a bit more conservative in their statistical analysis.)  </em>That turned out to be irrelevant, because they&#8217;d made an error.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that one mark against OPERA&#8217;s result was that it was particularly implausible and difficult to fit into existing knowledge. Daya Bay&#8217;s result is a lot more plausible and not in any way inconsistent with other things  we know.</p>
<p>But still, <em>if we only had Daya Bay&#8217;s measurement, then indeed there would be good reason to be patient and cautious</em>. The measurement they are making is difficult. They are observing only a 6% deficit in the number of electron-antineutrinos compared to the number they expected &#8212; a small effect.  You may well be tired of hearing me say that <em><strong>first-time experimental measurements commonly turn out to be wrong</strong></em>, but I&#8217;ll say it again: Daya Bay isn&#8217;t exempt from this caveat.</p>
<p>However, already <em><strong>before</strong></em> Daya Bay produced its result, three pre-cursors to this experiment had reported hints over the past few months that are consistent with what Daya Bay now sees. These were T2K (in Japan), MINOS (in the U.S.A.), and Double Chooz (in France). Double Chooz is also a reactor experiment (as in Figure 1), while T2K and MINOS are accelerator experiments (similar in some ways to OPERA) in which <a title="Making Neutrino Beams" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/making-neutrino-beams/">high-energy muon-neutrinos are produced in one laboratory</a> and a detector in a laboratory hundreds of kilometers away <a title="How One Detects Neutrinos" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/how-one-detects-neutrinos/">tries to measure whether a significant fraction of them convert to electron-neutrinos while in flight</a> &#8212; a process also sensitive to θ<sub>13.</sub></p>
<p>Much more impressively, just a couple of weeks <em><strong>after</strong></em> Daya Bay&#8217;s result was announced, the RENO experiment in Korea (which is a reactor experiment similar to Daya Bay, and had been competing with them, hoping to beat them to the punch) <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.0626" target="_blank">announced <em>its</em> result</a>. What RENO finds is completely consistent with what Daya Bay has measured, and is <del>even just a bit more</del> <em>[after improved analysis, just a bit less]</em> statistically significant.</p>
<p>In short, we have very quickly seen two experiments measure θ<sub>13</sub>  independently, using different nuclear reactors and somewhat different experimental designs, and subject to different potential problems. They both make the measurement as illustrated in Figure 1, as a ratio between what is observed by nearby detectors and what is observed by farther ones; such a technique is reassuringly cushioned from many types of possible errors. They get essentially the same answer (about 0.15 or so in radians). And they were preceded by three experiments that collectively were all already hinting that θ<sub>13</sub> was larger than 0.08 radians or so.</p>
<p>Is it possible that they are all wrong, and that θ<sub>13</sub> is actually zero, or at least much smaller than 0.15 radians? In principle, yes; that possibility is still large enough to be worth remembering. The measurements are not simple. Is it likely? Not very. <em><strong>Not with so much consistent evidence, some of it strong, coming from so many different experiments.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>The Implications</strong></p>
<p>So science has probably made a step forward. It is highly probable that we now know something about neutrinos that we did not know last year. Over time, as RENO and especially Daya Bay (which, because of its design, will pull ahead of its rivals) collect more data, their results will become more  precise and will likely become more and more convincing. The new information will then go gradually from &#8220;highly probable&#8221; to &#8220;near certain.&#8221; We&#8217;ll be watching this process over the next couple of years, though it will be slow and unexciting and will engender little public comment &#8212; unless it stumbles unexpectedly.</p>
<p>In comparing this story to the speedy neutrino saga, we get to see both sides of how science works. Sometimes experiments conflict with each other; first one experiment claims a new result, then others knock it down. So it was with <a title="This Time, ICARUS Really DOES Refute OPERA" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/16/this-time-icarus-really-does-refute-opera/" target="_blank">OPERA and ICARUS</a>.   But sometimes they agree, which provides some confidence in the result. So it is with Daya Bay and RENO, as well as their predecessors.  Both the OPERA/ICARUS story and the Daya Bay/RENO story show science working well, preventing falsehoods from leaking into scientific knowledge, and assuring that only those potential facts that have run a gauntlet of cross-checks are allowed into the textbooks of our children.</p>
<p>One more thing: should you, personally, care about the scientific result of this neutrino success story? Whether θ<sub>13</sub> is zero or not will not keep you awake at night, and the new result does not potentially challenge a hundred years of theoretical physics, as OPERA&#8217;s result might have done had it been correct. But still, it is significant for several reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>a short-term scientific implication</strong>: a non-zero θ<sub>13</sub> makes possible a class of experiments looking for CP violation in neutrinos. (I described what CP violation means in <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/11/16/a-notable-discrepancy-at-the-lhcb-experiment/" target="_blank">a post discussing its appearance in the physics of quarks</a>. ) There are many physicists who believe that CP violation in neutrinos may give deep insights into why the universe has more matter than anti-matter (i.e. more electrons than positrons, and more protons and neutrons than anti-protons and anti-neutrons.) So that experimental program will now go ahead.</li>
<li><strong>a long-term scientific implication:</strong> the measurement of θ<sub>13</sub>  gives us some insight into the processes that might be responsible for neutrinos having the masses that they do.   I call this long-term because we don&#8217;t know what neutrino masses are yet!  (We just know some differences of the squares of masses.)  But many theories of neutrino masses would have predicted  θ<sub>13</sub> much smaller than measured by Daya Bay and RENO, so those theories can now be discarded.</li>
<li><strong>a long-term, long-shot technological implication:</strong> it seems likely to me that someday neutrinos will be a technological tool. The applications will be limited because huge numbers of neutrinos are needed if one is use them to measure anything, but still, neutrinos are the only known measurable particles that can pass through large quantities of rock and potentially convey to us information about what&#8217;s in there. And one can&#8217;t dream broadly about neutrino-based technology without a more complete knowledge of how neutrinos behave.  This most recent information fills in one of the key missing pieces.</li>
<li><strong>other long-term, long-shot scientific implications</strong>: we need a full understanding of neutrinos if we are to use the neutrinos coming from supernovas to learn better how supernovas work (and remember how important supernovas are &#8212; their precursor stars are the furnaces in which many nuclei of the heavier chemical elements are forged, and the supernovas themselves blow those elements across wide expanses of interstellar space, eventually to help form the cores of rocky planets and the bodies of human beings.)  There are likely to be other contexts, too, in which this knowledge is crucial for gaining understanding of phenomena in which neutrinos play a central role.</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe there are other implications that neutrino experts remember that I&#8217;m forgetting right now. But suffice it to say that our children will likely care, indirectly, about this measurement, quite possibly for reasons that we cannot yet imagine.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At various conferences in the late fall, the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC] experiments ATLAS and CMS showed us many measurements that they made using data they took in spring and summer of 2011. But during the fall their data sets increased in size by a factor of two and a half!  So far this year the only results we&#8217;d seen that involved the 2011 full data set had been <a title="This Week’s Step Forward in the Search for the Higgs Particle" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/02/09/this-weeks-step-forward-in-the-search-for-the-higgs-particle/">ones needed in the search for the Higgs particle</a>. Last week, that started to change.</p>
<p>The spring flood is just beginning. Many new experimental results from the LHC were announced at <a href="http://www.pi.infn.it/lathuile/lathuile_2012.html" target="_blank">La Thuile</a> this past week, some only using part of the 2011 data but a few using all of it, and more and more will be coming every day for the next couple of weeks. And there are also new results coming from the <a title="The Tevatron Comes to an End" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/09/30/the-tevatron-comes-to-an-end/">(now-closed) Tevatron</a> experiments CDF and DZero, which are completing many analyses that use their full data set. In particular, we&#8217;re expecting them to report on their best crack at the Higgs particle later this week. They can only hope to create controversy; they certainly won&#8217;t be able to settle the issue as to whether there is or isn&#8217;t a Higgs particle with a mass of about 125 <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/">GeV</a>/c<sup>2</sup>, as <a title="Reviewing the Search for the Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/01/24/reviewing-the-search-for-the-higgs/" target="_blank">hints from ATLAS and CMS seem to indicate</a>.  But all indications are that it will be an interesting week on the Higgs front.</p>
<p><strong>The Top Quark Checks In</strong></p>

This can be tested using the W decay to an anti-neutron and an electron or muon; the direction that the electron or muon takes can be predicted.  The data above shows excellent agreement between theory and experiment, again validating the theory of the Higgs mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

A precise test of this idea arises as follows. When the top quark decays to a bottom quark and a W particle, and the W then decays to an anti-neutrino and an electron or muon, the probability that the electron or muon travels in a particular direction can be predicted assuming the Higgs mechanism. The data above shows excellent agreement between theory and experiment, validating the notion of the Higgs field.</p></div>
<p>There are now many new measurements of the properties of the top quark, poking and prodding it from all sides (figuratively)  to see if it behaves as expected within the &#8220;Standard Model of particle physics&#8221; [the equations that we use to describe all of <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/">the known particles and forces</a> of nature.] And so far, disappointingly for those of us hoping for clues as to why the top quark is so much heavier than the other quarks, there&#8217;s no sign of anything amiss with those equations. Top quarks and anti-quarks are produced in pairs more or less as expected, with the expected rate, and moving in the expected directions with the expected amount of energy. Top quark decay to a W particle and a bottom quark also agrees, in detail, with theoretical expectation.  Specifically (see Figure 1) the orientation of the W&#8217;s intrinsic angular momentum (called its &#8220;spin&#8221;, technically), a key test of the Standard Model in general and of the <a title="The Higgs FAQ 1.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/360-2/">Higgs mechanism</a> in particular, agrees very well with theoretical predictions.  Meanwhile there&#8217;s no sign that there are unexpected ways of producing top quarks, nor any sign of particles that are heavy cousins of the top quark.</p>
<p>One particularly striking result from CMS relates to the unexpectedly large asymmetry in the production of top quarks observed at the Tevatron experiments, which <a title="Apparent Unexpected Asymmetries in the Production of Quarks" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/tevatron-news/apparent-unexpected-asymmetries-in-the-production-of-quarks/">I&#8217;ve previously written about in detail.</a> The number of top quarks produced moving roughly in the same direction as the <em>proton</em> beam is <strong><em>expected</em></strong> theoretically to be only very slightly larger than the number moving roughly in the same direction as the <em>anti-proton</em> beam, but instead both CDF and DZero <em><strong>observe a</strong> <strong>much larger effect</strong></em>. This significant apparent discrepancy between their measurement and the prediction of the Standard Model has generated lots of interest and hope that perhaps we are seeing a crack in the Standard Model&#8217;s equations.</p>
<p>Well, it isn&#8217;t so easy for CMS and ATLAS to make the same measurement, because the LHC has two proton beams, so it is symmetric front-to-back, unlike the Tevatron with its proton beam and anti-proton beam.   But still, there are other related asymmetries that LHC experiments can measure. And CMS has now looked with its full 2011 data set, and observes&#8230; nothing: for a particular charge asymmetry that they can measure, they find an asymmetry of 0.4% +- 1.0% +- 1.2% (the first number is the best estimate and the latter two numbers are the statistical and systematic uncertainties on that estimate).  The Standard Model predicts something of order a percent or so, while many attempts to explain the Tevatron result might have predicted an effect of several percent.  (ATLAS has presented a similar measurement but only using part of the 2011 data set, so it has much larger uncertainties at present.)</p>
<p>Now CMS is not measuring quite the same thing as CDF and DZero, so the CMS result is not in direct conflict with the Tevatron measurements. But if new phenomena were present that were causing the CDF and DZero&#8217;s anomalously large asymmetry, we&#8217;d expect that by now they&#8217;d be starting to show up, at least a little bit, in this CMS measurement.  The fact that CMS sees not a hint of anything unexpected considerably weakens the overall case that the Tevatron excess asymmetry might have an exciting explanation. It suggests rather that the whole effect is really a problem with the interpretation of the Tevatron measurements themselves, or with the ways that the equations of the Standard Model are used to predict them. That is of course disappointing, but it is still far too early to declare the case closed.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a subtle connection here with the recent<a title="LHCb’s Result From November Appears Confirmed by CDF" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/01/lhcbs-result-from-november-appears-confirmed-by-cdf/"> bolstering by CDF</a> of the <a title="A Notable Discrepancy at the LHCb Experiment" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/11/16/a-notable-discrepancy-at-the-lhcb-experiment/">LHCb experiment&#8217;s claim</a> that CP violation is present in the decays of particles called &#8220;D mesons&#8221;. (D mesons are <a title="What’s a Hadron?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-hadron-as-in-large-hadron-collider/">hadrons</a> containing a <strong>charm</strong> quark [or anti-quark], an <strong>up </strong>or<strong> down</strong> anti-quark [or quark], and [as for all hadrons]<a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/"> lots of additional gluons and quark/anti-quark pairs</a>.) The problem is that theorists, who used to be quite sure that any such CP violation in D mesons would indicate the presence of new phenomena not predicted by the Standard Model, are no longer so sure. So one needs corroborating information from somewhere, showing some other related phenomenon, before getting too excited.</p>
<p>One place that such information might have come from is the top quark.  If there is something surprising in charm quarks (but not in bottom quarks) one might easily imagine that perhaps there is something new affecting all up-type quarks (the up quark, charm quark and top quark) more than the down-type quarks (down, strange and bottom.)  <em>[<a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/">Read here about the known elementary particles and how they are organized.</a>]</em> In other words, if the charm quark is different from expectations and the bottom quark is not, it would seem quite reasonable that the top quark would be even more different from expectations. But  unfortunately, the results from this week suggest the top quark, to the level of precision that can currently be mustered, is behaving very much as the Standard Model predicted it would.</p>
<p><strong>Meanwhile Nothing Else Checks In</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the direct search for new particles not predicted by the Standard Model, there were a number of new results from CMS and ATLAS at La Thuile. The talks on these subjects went flying by; there was far too little information presented to allow understanding of any details, and so without fully studying the corresponding papers I can&#8217;t say anything more intelligent yet than that they didn&#8217;t see anything amiss. But of course, <a title="Some thoughts on why there’s so much Tevatron news." href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/07/21/some-thoughts-on-why-theres-so-much-tevatron-news/">as I&#8217;ve suggested many times</a>, searches of this type wouldn&#8217;t be shown so soon after the data was collected if they indicated any discrepancy with theoretical prediction, unless the discrepancy was spectacularly convincing. More likely, they would be delayed a few weeks or even months, while they were double- and triple-checked, and perhaps even held back for more data to be collected to clarify the situation. So we are left with the question as to which of the other measurements that weren&#8217;t shown are appearing later because, well, some things take longer than others, and which ones (if any) are being actively held back because they are more &#8230; interesting. At this preliminary stage in the conference season it&#8217;s too early to start that guessing game.</p>

The Z particle itself is the bump at 90 GeV; any new particle would appear as a bump elsewhere in the plot.  But above the Z mass, the data (black dots) show a smooth curve with no significant bumps.</p></div>
<p>So here&#8217;s a few words about what ATLAS and CMS didn&#8217;t see. Several classic searches for supersymmetry and other theories that resemble it (in that they show signs of invisible particles, <a title="Jets: The Manifestation of Quarks and Gluons" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/jets-the-manifestation-of-quarks-and-gluons/">jets from high-energy quarks and gluons</a>, and something rare like a lepton or two or a photon), were updated by CMS for the full or near-full data set. Searches for heavy versions of the top and bottom quark were shown by ATLAS and CMS. ATLAS sought heavy versions of the Z particle (see Figure 2) that decay to a high energy electron/positron pair or muon/anti-muon pair; with their full 2011 data set, they now exclude particles of this type up to masses (depending on the precise details of the particle) of 1.75-1.95 TeV/c<sup>2</sup>. Meanwhile CMS looked for heavy versions of the W particle that can decay to an electron or muon and something invisible; the exclusions reach out above 2.5 TeV/c<sup>2</sup>. Other CMS searches using the full data set included ones seeking new particles decaying to two Z particles, or to a W and a Z.   ATLAS looked for a variety of exotic particles, and CMS looked for events that are very energetic and produce many known particles at once.  Most of these searches were actually ones we&#8217;d seen before, just updated with more data, but a few of them were entirely new.</p>
<p>Two CMS searches worth noting involved looking for new undetectable particles recoiling against a single jet or a single photon. These put very interesting constraints on dark matter that are complementary to the searches that have been going on elsewhere, deep underground.  Using vats of liquid xenon or bubble chambers or solid-state devices, physicists have been looking for the very rare process in which a dark matter particle, one among the vast ocean of dark matter particles in which our galaxy is immersed, bumps into an atomic nucleus inside a detector and makes a tiny little signal for physicists to detect. Remarkable and successful as their search techniques are, there are two obvious contexts in which they work very poorly. If dark matter particles are very lightweight, much lighter than a few GeV/c<sup>2</sup>, the effect of one hitting a nucleus becomes very hard to detect. Or if the nature of the interaction of dark matter with ordinary matter is such that it depends on the spin (the intrinsic angular momentum) of a nucleus rather than on how many protons and neutrons the nucleus contains, then the probability of a collision becomes much, much lower. But in either case, as long as dark matter is affected by the weak nuclear force, the LHC can produce dark matter particles, and though ATLAS and CMS can&#8217;t detect them, they can detect particles that might sometimes recoil against them, such as a photon or a<a title="Jets: The Manifestation of Quarks and Gluons" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/jets-the-manifestation-of-quarks-and-gluons/"> jet</a>. So CMS was quite proud to show that their results are complementary to those other classes of experiments.</p>

<p>Finally, <a title="Something Curious at the Large Hadron Collider" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/10/19/something-curious-at-the-large-hadron-collider/">I made a moderately big deal back in October</a> about a small excess in multi-leptons (collisions that produce three or more electrons, muons, positrons [anti-electrons] or antimuons, <a title="Multi-Lepton Events: A Good Place to Look for New Physics" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/multi-lepton-events-a-good-place-to-look-for-new-physics/">which are a good place to look for new phenomena</a>), though I warned you in bold red letters that <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em><strong>most small excesses go away with more data</strong></em></span>. A snippet of an update was shown at La Thuile, and from what I said earlier about results that appear early in the conference season, you know that&#8217;s bad news. Suffice it to say that although discrepancies with theoretical predictions remain, the ones seen in October apparently haven&#8217;t become more striking. The caveat that most small excesses go away applies, so far, to this data set as well. We&#8217;ll keep watching.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back in November, <a title="A Notable Discrepancy at the LHCb Experiment" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/11/16/a-notable-discrepancy-at-the-lhcb-experiment/">I described a surprising result from the LHCb experiment</a> at the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC] concerning &#8220;CP violation&#8221; in the decays of particles called &#8220;D mesons&#8221; (which are hadrons that contain an unpaired charm quark or an unpaired charm antiquark) at a level much larger than expected by theorists.  Rather than rehashing the explanation for what that was all about, I&#8217;m going to <a title="A Notable Discrepancy at the LHCb Experiment" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/11/16/a-notable-discrepancy-at-the-lhcb-experiment/" target="_blank">point you to what I wrote in November</a>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s news this week that the CDF experiment at the now-closed Tevatron has updated its result for a measurement of the same quantity, using the full CDF data set.  And they now find a very similar result to what LHCb found.   This is indicated on the slide shown below, taken from the <a href="http://agenda.infn.it/getFile.py/access?contribId=37&amp;sessionId=5&amp;resId=0&amp;materialId=slides&amp;confId=4116" target="_blank">talk given by Angelo Di Canto at the La Thuile conference</a> (but edited by me to fix a big typo; I hope he does not mind.)  You see that while LHCb found a CP-violating asymmetry of -0.82%, with statistical and systematic uncertainties of 0.21% and 0.11%, CDF finds -0.62%, with almost identical uncertainties &#8212; a little closer to zero, but still well away from it.</p>

The CDF result is in orange at the top; the LHCb result is in black just below it. In the figure, the LHCb result is in blue, the CDF result in orange, and the traditional expectation for the Standard Model is very close to the point (0,0), the isolated red dot at dead center.</p></div>
<p style="text-align:left;">This lends support to LHCb&#8217;s result, and putting the two results (and a couple of other weaker ones) together makes their combination discrepant from zero by about 3.8 standard deviations.  That&#8217;s great, but not as great as it would have been if what theorists thought a few years ago was still considered reliable.  Back then, the relevant experts (and I should emphasize I am not one of them) would have told you that they were pretty darn certain that the Standard Model <em>[the equations we use to describe the known particles and forces]</em> could not produce CP violation of this type, and any observation of a non-zero signal would imply the existence of previously unknown particles.  But the experts  have been backing away from this point of view recently, worrying that maybe they know less about how to calculate this in the Standard Model than they used to think.  If we&#8217;re to be sure this is really a sign of new particles in nature, and not just a sign that theorists have trouble predicting this quantity, we&#8217;re going to need additional evidence from another quarter.  And so far, we haven&#8217;t got any.</p>
