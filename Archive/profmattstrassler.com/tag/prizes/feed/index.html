										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This year&#8217;s Nobel Prize, presumably to be given for the prediction of the particle known today as the &#8220;<a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">Higgs boson</a>&#8221;, will be awarded next week.  But in the meantime, <a href="http://www.aps.org/programs/honors/new-recipients.cfm" target="_blank">the American Physical Society has made a large number of awards</a>.  A few of them are to people whose work I know about, so I thought I&#8217;d tell you just a little about them.</p>
<p>The J. J. Sakurai prize went to Professors Zvi Bern, Lance Dixon and David Kosower, for the work that I have already described on this website <a title="From String Theory to the Large Hadron Collider" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/08/15/from-string-theory-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a title="A Quantum Gravity and Cosmology Conference" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/16/a-quantum-gravity-cosmology-conference/" target="_blank">here</a>.  Dixon, a wide-ranging expert in particle physics, quantum field theory and string theory, was a young professor at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center when I was a Stanford graduate student.  He taught an excellent course on string theory, and provided a lot of scientific advice and insight outside the classroom.  Bern and Kosower were young scientists using string theory to learn about how to do computations in quantum field theory, and their surprising results formed the starting point for <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Bern_Kosower_Rules_and_Their_Relatio.html?id=FacCGwAACAAJ" target="_blank">my Ph. D. thesis</a> (which has their names in its title.)   The range of their work is hard to describe in a paragraph, but let&#8217;s just say that no one is surprised that they were awarded a prize of this magnitude.</p>
<p>The Dannie Heineman Prize for Mathematical Physics was awarded to my former colleague Greg Moore, a professor at Rutgers University.  &#8220;<em>For eminent contributions to mathematical physics with a wide influence in many fields, ranging from string theory to supersy<em>mmetric gauge theory, conformal field theory, condensed matter physics and four-manifold theory.</em>&#8221; </em> Allow me to translate:</p>
<ul>
<li>string theory: you&#8217;ve heard about it, probably</li>
<li>supersymmetric gauge theory: <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part 2)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/24/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-2/" target="_blank">quantum field theories</a> with <a title="Supersymmetry — What Is It?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/supersymmetry-what-is-it/" target="_blank">supersymmetry</a>, which I&#8217;ll be writing about soon</li>
<li>conformal field theory: basically, <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part 2)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/24/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-2/" target="_blank">quantum field theories that are scale invariant</a></li>
<li><a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/23/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions/" target="_blank">condensed matter</a> physics: the study of solids and liquids and their mechanical and electrical properties, and lots of other things too, in which quantum field theory is sometimes a useful tool</li>
<li>four-manifold theory: the mathematics of spaces which have four-spatial dimensions, or three-spatial dimensions and one-time dimension.  These spaces are very interesting to mathematicians, and also, they&#8217;re interesting because we live in one.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not the complete range of Moore&#8217;s work by any means.  Unfortunately this website doesn&#8217;t yet have pages that can put his work in proper context, but perhaps I&#8217;ll return to it later.  But again, no surprise here to see Moore&#8217;s name on this award.</p>
<p>The Tom W. Bonner Prize in Nuclear Physics was awarded to experimental physicist William A. Zajc, currently chairman of the Columbia University physics department.  Zajc has been heavily involved in one of the most surprising discoveries of the past fifteen years: that a hot dense fireball of quarks, anti-quarks and gluons (produced in the collision of two relatively large atomic nuclei) behaves in a very unexpected way, more like a very low viscosity liquid rather like than a gas.  I&#8217;ve known him partly because of his interest in the attempts to apply string theory to certain quantum field theories that are perhaps relevant in the modeling of this novel physical system&#8230; something I&#8217;ll also probably be writing about in the relatively near future.</p>
<div>
<p>And the W.K.H. Panofsky Prize in Experimental Particle Physics went to Kam-Biu Luk (Berkeley) and Yifang Wang (Director of China&#8217;s Institute of High Energy Physics)<em>: For their leadership of the <em><a title="A Neutrino Success Story" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/04/09/a-neutrino-success-story/" target="_blank">Daya Bay experiment, which produced the first definitive measurement of the theta-13 angle of the neutrino mixing matrix.</a>  </em></em>For the same experiment, the Henry Primakoff Award for Early-Career Particle Physics went to Daniel A. Dwyer of Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory.  I wrote about <a title="A Neutrino Success Story" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/04/09/a-neutrino-success-story/" target="_blank">the Daya Bay measurement here</a>; their result is one of the major measurements in particle physics in the past few years.</p>
<p>I wish I knew more about the other recipients outside my areas of expertise, but other bloggers will have to cover those stories.</p>
<p>Anyway, no surprises, but some very deserving scientists.  Let&#8217;s see if next Tuesday brings the same result.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[As I think most of us in the field expected, professor Alexander Polyakov was selected from among the nominees as the winner of  a cool $3 million check  Fundamental Physics Prize today.  Polyakov (who has spent the last two decades &#8230; <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/03/20/and-the-new-rich-and-famous-man-is-sasha-polyakov/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#000000;">As I think most of us in the field expected, professor Alexander Polyakov was selected from among the nominees as the winner of  a <del>cool $3 million check</del>  <a href="http://www.fundamentalphysicsprize.org/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#000000;">Fundamental Physics Prize</span></a> today. <span id="more-5711"></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Polyakov (who has spent the last two decades at Princeton University; the average wealth in that town has increased slightly in the last two years) is legendary for his wide-ranging contributions to theoretical physics, and he is certainly deserving of some fame outside the physics community.  We owe him a great deal for our understanding of many aspects of quantum field theory (the mathematical technology used in the so-called Standard Model to describe the <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#000000;">known elementary particles and forces</span></a><em></em>, and also used widely in the physics of solids, in string theory, and elsewhere.)  Much of his work, starting in the 1960s and 1970s, and continuing to the present, allowed quantum field theorists to study, understand and/or discover crucially important phenomena which cannot be explored using the famous but quite limited methods of &#8220;perturbation theory&#8221;, of which Feynman diagrams are an example.  His name or initial appears on many objects and phenomena of importance in physics (&#8216;t Hooft-Polyakov magnetic monopoles, Polyakov loops, BPST instantons, BPZ conformal blocks, and so on); you&#8217;ll find his name in the <strong>title</strong> of over 500 papers.  He was perhaps the first person to show that if string theory and quantum field theory were somehow equivalent (an idea that goes back to the 1970s) then the string theory would have more spatial dimensions than the field theory does &#8212; a notion that was eventually explicitly realized in the AdS/CFT (or &#8220;gauge/string&#8221;) correspondence for which Juan Maldacena is famous.  (The two next papers on that subject, appearing almost simultaneously following Maldacena&#8217;s 1997 work, were one by Witten and one by Gubser, Klebanov and&#8230; Polyakov.) He even did some work relevant for the current Higgs excitement, back in the 1960s.  I cannot hope to convey how much I have learned about quantum field theory from his papers.  In short: hearty congratulations to Professor Polyakov!</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">NOTE ADDED: I have noticed that a number of people are referring to Professor Polyakov as a &#8220;string theorist&#8221;.  Perhaps this was inevitable, given the politics of the field and of the relevant blogs, but it greatly diminishes Polyakov&#8217;s work to reduce him to a single label.  Yes, he did some of the most foundational work in string theory.  But that&#8217;s not all, by any means; many of his most famous and lasting contributions lie outside of string theory, addressing basic issues in quantum field theories (magnetic monopoles, quantum tunneling [&#8220;instantons&#8221;], phase transitions) that are or could well be relevant in the Standard Model and/or in some of its possible extensions, such as Grand Unification.  And even many of his contributions to string theory involved very fundamental issues in quantum field theory which have application outside of string theory as well (properties of scale-invariant [technically, &#8220;conformally&#8221; invariant] theories.)   In short, his work is important to all people who use quantum field theory, including but not limited to string theorists, and he deserves the highest respect for his contributions to our understanding of some very subtle aspects of our world.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Just to drive the point home, I&#8217;d like to quote from <a href="http://quantumfrontiers.com/2012/12/11/fundamental-physics-prize-prediction-polyakov/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#000000;">Caltech Professor John Preskill&#8217;s post from last December</span></a>, describing Polyakov; Preskill is about 15 years older than I am.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><em>&#8220;I have never gotten to know Sasha Polyakov well, but like all theoretical physicists of my generation I hold him in awe. When I was a graduate student in the late 1970s, there were two great physicists who seemed to be leading most of the great advances in quantum field theory: Polyakov and <a href="http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/%7Ehooft101/"><span style="color:#000000;">Gerard ‘t  Hooft</span></a>&#8230;. What those two achieved in the 70s and early 80s is truly astonishing.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><em>There are close parallels in the work of ‘t Hooft and Polyakov. They independently discovered that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%27t_Hooft%E2%80%93Polyakov_monopole"><span style="color:#000000;">magnetic monopoles</span></a> arise as solitons in spontaneously broken gauge theories. Both made fundamental contributions to our understanding of the role of quantum tunneling (“<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instanton"><span style="color:#000000;">instantons</span></a>“) in quantum field theory, and  recognized that quark confinement hinges on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_vortex"><span style="color:#000000;">topology</span></a> of gauge fields. Aside from all that, Polyakov launched the path integral approach to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyakov_action"><span style="color:#000000;">string theory in non-critical dimensions</span></a>, and  laid out the formalism of <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/055032138490052X"><span style="color:#000000;">two-dimensional conformal field theory</span></a>, a contribution just as seminal in condensed matter physics as in particle theory.&#8221;</em></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A pause from the usual stuff for a necessary reminder: <strong>please keep the comments of a non-personal nature.</strong> Talk about the science; if someone makes a mistake, say so, but don&#8217;t attack their personalities and intelligence. While I was away from the computer there were a number of comments that turned very nasty toward an individual, and I don&#8217;t want that happening here. I did some editing of the worst stuff, but I&#8217;d much rather not have to.  Yes, I know some very nasty personal things about me have been said in past comments; but while you&#8217;re free to defend me when that happens, please don&#8217;t say anything offensive about someone else.</p>
<p>The relevant comments, however, did have some content, which I&#8217;ve tried to leave in place.  They were relating to the Milner $,$$$,$$$ prizes (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/31/science/9-scientists-win-yuri-milners-fundamental-physics-prize.html" target="_blank">here&#8217;s the NY Times article.</a>)  Once-respected Nature News, whose reputation is in precipitous decline within high-energy physics, did a story on the Milner prize in which the only people quoted (other than awardees saying &#8220;ooh&#8221; and &#8220;aah&#8221;) were Milner himself and blogger Peter Woit. No matter what you think of the prize [and I have my own serious concerns], it is shocking that an article in Nature on this subject does not quote a single scientist, within or outside the field, whether for or against the prize. I&#8217;ve asked for an explanation. Have scientists become invisible? Do we have no rights to express our own opinions anymore?  Are we destined to have our fates and research determined by former science students who haven&#8217;t been in the field for decades but have become extremely wealthy and/or extremely vocal?  Hello?  Is anyone sensible still out there?<span id="more-4188"></span></p>
<p>At least <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/physics-prize-dwarfs-all-others-1.11131" target="_blank">today the same reporter managed to quote George Smoot</a>, who, last time I checked, has actually contributed something to science itself.  Maybe Nature News could find a few more real scientists to interview.</p>
<p>Also disturbing is that although part of Woit&#8217;s statement in the first article is scientifically inaccurate, Nature published it anyway (and the only counter to it was from non-scientist Milner.)  And Scientific American also did not note the error, passing on the article to its readers.  Quality control on articles written for public consumption remains a serious problem for communicating particle physics to the public.  <em>[Woit said that theories studied by some of the awardees &#8212; perhaps Seiberg, and/or perhaps Arkani-Hamed, he didn&#8217;t specify &#8212; are now ruled out by LHC data.  I wish it were true; it would make my job a lot easier.  But unfortunately, it takes a very long time for the LHC to rule theories out, because we have to search carefully, and the searches done so far are still by no means complete.  And that&#8217;s why I, and others doing <strong>real work</strong> at the LHC, have to <a title="A Real Workshop" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/08/07/a-real-workshop/">spend days at workshops</a> &#8212; making sure a sufficiently thorough search is carried out.  Only with a proper search can we draw a strong conclusion, worthy of the adjective &#8220;scientific&#8221;, as to what is and isn&#8217;t ruled out by LHC data.]<br />
</em></p>
<p>My own opinion, for what it is worth, is that the Milner Prize&#8217;s first step has not been healthy for science.  No matter how well-educated a person is about a topic, it is a mistake for that person to award prizes on the basis of his or her own personal opinion, with no advisory committee and no widespread call for nominations.  Furthermore, since the awardees will apparently form part or all of the new committee, the project is already in danger of becoming a self-reproducing system.  It&#8217;s clear to anyone in the field that all of the awardees are obviously deserving of recognition; but they&#8217;re all already famous and mostly well-paid.  What upsets me is that there is a long, long list of deserving scientists, some of whom have received little recognition despite their important work, and some of whom could really use some research money and/or time off from teaching &#8212; and Milner overlooked them all.  In short, the first Milner prize round involves hero-worship <em>[BTW, no heroines allowed, it would appear]</em> and that does not obviously serve the public or the scientific process.</p>
