										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Wow</strong></em>, it was <a title="Happy (Chilly) New Year" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/01/07/happy-chilly-new-year/" target="_blank">unusually cold last week</a>. In a small fraction of the globe. For a couple of days. And what does that cold snap, that big wiggle in the <em><strong><span style="color:#00ccff;">Polar Vortex</span></strong></em> that carries high-atmospheric winds around the North Pole, imply about &#8220;climate change&#8221;, also known as &#8220;global warming&#8221;, also known as &#8220;global weirding&#8221;?</p>
<p>The answer is very simple. <strong>Nothing.</strong></p>
<p>If you heard anyone suggest otherwise &#8212; whether they said that the extreme <em><strong>cold</strong></em> implies that there is <em>no</em> global warming going on, or they said that the <em><strong>extreme</strong></em> cold implies that global warming <em>is</em> happening &#8212; you should seriously question anything that person says when it comes to climate change. Because that person does not respect (or perhaps even understand) the difference between anecdote and evidence; between weather and climate; between a large fluctuation and a small but long-term trend. Or between media hoopla and science.</p>
<p>In the interest of an imperfect analogy: Let me ask you this. Are you generally happier, or less happy, than you were five years ago? Answer this as best you can.</p>
<p>Now let me ask you another question. Did you, within the last month, have a really, really bad day, or a really, really good one?</p>
<p>Does the answer to the second question have much to do with the answer to the first one?</p>
<p>Barring an exceptional recent disaster in your personal or professional life, the fact that, say, last Thursday your car broke down, you locked yourself out of your house, your dog vomited on the carpet and you got caught in the rain without your umbrella does not have anything to do with whether you are a happier person than you were five years ago. Being a happier person has more to do with whether you have a better job, a happier family, a better sense of self-esteem, and things like that. And even if you love your job, you know there are going to be really bad days in the office sometimes. That&#8217;s just the way it goes. We all know that.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the same with <a href="http://www.macrotrends.net/1319/dow-jones-100-year-historical-chart" target="_blank">daily and monthly and yearly fluctuations in the stock market</a> compared to the <a href="http://www.measuringworth.com/datasets/usgdp/graph.php" target="_blank">slow but fairly steady century-long growth of the U.S. economy</a> (both curves corrected for inflation.)</p>
<p><strong><em>So why, when there&#8217;s a big fluctuation in the daily, monthly or even seasonal weather, do people jump up and down about what the implications are for the long-term trends in climate?<span id="more-7104"></span></em></strong></p>
<p>Any one fluctuation, whether hot or cold, dry or wet, windy or calm, is by itself irrelevant. Weather fluctuates; that&#8217;s just how it is. It&#8217;s by no means unusual, now or in the distant past, for temperatures in the central United States to swing by 50ºF (28ºC) in just a few hours. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.weather.com/news/5-extreme-temperature-drops-20130118" target="_blank">a fun story by the Weather Channel</a> listing a few extreme temperature swings, all of which were more dramatic than the recent cold spell.  Weather in the U.S. has seen extremes since before Europeans arrived here and started recording their experiences, and it will continue to do so whether global warming persists or not.</p>
<p>Moreover, the recent cold wasn&#8217;t as exceptional as portrayed in the press, or as it seemed to people under the age of 40. One of the reasons that so many records were set this past week was that January 7th, over the past century, hasn&#8217;t previously seen an exceptionally cold day in the southeast. Specifically, let&#8217;s look at Greensboro, North Carolina, which was <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/coldest-jan-7-ever-15-record-low-temperatures-set-polar-vortex-1531012" target="_blank">described in the press as follows</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Greensboro, N.C., also witnessed a major drop in its record low temperature, going from a previous record of 14 degrees to 5 degrees. &#8220;</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, what were (before this year) the record temps in that town during the first 10 days of January? (see <a href="http://www.erh.noaa.gov/rah/climate/data/gso.daily.records.temp.precip.html">http://www.erh.noaa.gov/rah/climate/data/gso.daily.records.temp.precip.html</a>)</p>
<p>Jan 1: 8<br />
Jan 2: 5<br />
Jan 3: 7<br />
Jan 4: 3<br />
Jan 5: 3<br />
Jan 6: 5<br />
Jan 7: 14 ==&gt; 5 in 2014<br />
Jan 8: 6<br />
Jan 9: 2<br />
Jan 10: 1<br />
Jan 11: -5</p>
<p>In other words, the previous century or so of January 7ths were unusual &#8212; every other day in early January had already seen a very cold day! <em>All this recent cold snap did was bring it into line with other cold early January days!</em> A similar story held true in Atlanta. In short, despite the &#8220;record cold&#8221; media hype, quite a few of the new &#8220;records&#8221; weren&#8217;t especially exceptional for January&#8230; they were &#8220;normal&#8221; records, not worthy of the amazement expressed by reporters and citizens alike.</p>
<p>The issue this highlights is that if you want to tell whether the climate is getting warmer, the record high and low temperatures on a given day aren&#8217;t going to tell you much! The record temperatures fluctuate and are subject to random, extraordinary events. We don&#8217;t know how rare those exceptional events are, and the more wild and spectacular they are, the less we know about them.  If something happens once every one, three or ten centuries, but we only have one century of records, we&#8217;ve only seen it happen once or perhaps twice, if ever.  So when it happens, we can&#8217;t say &#8220;aha, that&#8217;s something that would not have happened if it weren&#8217;t for climate change&#8221;. We can&#8217;t draw such a conclusion, anymore than we can conclude that your stunningly bad day at work last week implies that your job, in the grand scheme of things, isn&#8217;t going to be as fulfilling in future as it used to be.</p>
<p>Take a look at this plot, from <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/NORMS/DisplayNORMS.asp?AirportCode=KSAT&amp;SafeCityName=San_Antonio&amp;StateCode=TX&amp;Units=none&amp;IATA=SAT" target="_blank">the website Weather Underground</a>, which tells us something about the weather and climate in San Antonio, Texas.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">It shows, for each day of the year, over many years, the average high and average low temperatures in blue, and the </span>record daily highs and lows in red. <span style="color:#808080;"><em>[Unfortunately I do not know exactly how many years are included in this data; I would estimate 60 years, but Weather Underground does not provide this important information &#8212; and they should.]  </em></span>Of course the average and record highs and lows all trend higher in the summer and lower in the winter, as expected. But notice:</p>
<ul>
<li>the average highs and lows are smooth curves</li>
<li>the record highs and lows are jagged curves</li>
</ul>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>Because for each day, <em>every year contributes to the average</em>. Year-to-year fluctuations for each day get smoothed out, as do day-to-day fluctuations in each year. So the curve showing the average is smooth as you move from one day to the next.</p>
<p>By contrast, only special, unique, remarkable, extraordinary days contribute to the record high and record low on a particular day. These are subject to large day-to-day fluctuations, because something extraordinary may have happened on January 9th of some 20th century year, but not on January 10th or 8th.</p>
<p>So a specific event with record heat or record cold isn&#8217;t useful for telling us about climate change.  Though impressive, it just represents the vagaries of life that get in the way of us understanding the real long-term trend, just as a truly bad day can make someone forget, for a short while anyway, that his or her life is going pretty well on the whole.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the same with extreme hurricanes and tornadoes, droughts and floods. These are too rare, and require too many elements to come together in a unique mix, for us to easily conclude anything about them. Hurricanes Irene and Sandy were a big deal in and around New York City; but are they signs of global warming?! What about the devastating 1938 hurricane that hit eastern New England? What about the two strong hurricanes that struck New England, a month apart, in 1869? It&#8217;s impossible to conclude that Irene and Sandy are related to global warming/weirding. Only if you see something steady over decades &#8212; the average storm becoming stronger, or the average number of storms rising &#8212; or a dramatic trend &#8212; Irene and Sandy-like storms ceasing to be rare and becoming once-every-other-year events over decades &#8212; will you be able to draw any conclusions from hurricanes that the climate has really changed.</p>
<p>No&#8230; if you want to determine whether global warming is occurring, you must set aside the record high or low temperatures, the extreme storms, the exceptional events&#8230; the ones that the media reports, and the ones that you yourself easily remember. Instead, you need to look at the averages &#8212; which is where the data is sufficient, and sufficiently stable, <a title="Climate Change in Climate Change" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/10/24/climate-change-in-climate-change/" target="_blank">for some conclusion that the Earth has slightly warmed</a> (by just 1 &#8211; 2 ºF = 0.5 &#8211; 1.1ºC &#8211;which is still <a href="http://themadisonenergygroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Ag_Upsala_Glacier.jpg" target="_blank">enough to melt a lot of glaciers</a>)  to be drawn. And even our current 100 years of data from around the globe is just barely enough to make that possible.  I&#8217;ll cover that issue another time.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s not waste our time fishing for red herrings.  Yes, it is possible that an overall small increase in the temperature of the globe will make wild weather more common. But it will be decades before we have enough data to tell whether, in fact, the rare events of which we have so few examples really are more or less common than they used to be.  And no one event, in isolation, should ever be mentioned in the same sentence as &#8220;climate change&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome 2014! And quite a start to the year, with a cold snap that rivals anything we&#8217;ve seen in two decades. I don&#8217;t remember cold like this since the horrid winter of 1994, when the Northeastern U.S. saw snowstorms and extreme cold that alternated back and forth for weeks. Of course, when I was a child in the 1970s, such chills happened a lot more often; I remember a number of New England mornings where I awoke to a thermometer reading of -20ºFahrenheit (-29ºCelsius) [244 Kelvin].</p>
<p>The scariest negative temperature numbers that one hears about from the media are associated with the &#8220;wind chill&#8221;, which is a number that is supposed to measure how cold the air &#8220;feels&#8221; to your skin.  But &#8220;wind chill&#8221; is a rather subjective and controversial measure &#8212; there&#8217;s no unique way to define it, since you&#8217;ll feel differently depending on how much exposed skin you have, on your body weight, on your age and conditioning, etc.  By contrast, the temperature measured by a thermometer is defined independent of how humans feel, and experts agree on what it is and means. Oh sure, people use different scales to measure it: Fahrenheit (F), Centigrade or Celsius (C), and Kelvin (K).  But the differences are no more than the distinction between meters and feet, or between kilograms and pounds; it&#8217;s straightforward, if a bit annoying, to convert from one to the other.</p>
<p>So everyone agrees the temperature is and <em>feels</em> extremely cold, But <strong>is it</strong>, from the point of nature, <strong>really that much colder than usual?</strong> To say it another way: it was 84ºF (29ºC) in southern Florida yesterday.  How much warmer is that than the -40ºF (-40ºC) that was registered in the cold Minnesota morning?</p>
<p>Well, you might first think: wow, it&#8217;s a difference of 124ºF (69ºC), which sounds like a <strong>huge</strong> difference.  But is it really so huge?<span id="more-7087"></span></p>
<p><strong>Perception and Reality</strong></p>
<p>We humans experience the world through our perceptions and our consciousness &#8212; through what we see, hear, feel, and so forth. And as is natural, we tend to assume that what we see, hear and feel correctly represents the world <em>as it is</em>. But in fact, as scientists have learned over the past centuries, the devices we use for our perceptions &#8212; eyes, ears, temperature-sensing nerves, and so on &#8212; filter and process the information that they receive from the outside world. Our brain then does further processing.  By the time the information enters our conscious notion of the world, the world has become a caricature, a cartoon, of the real thing.  Much of the world is ignored, and the part that we are conscious of is transformed almost beyond recognition.</p>
<p>Indeed, one of the first things young science students have to do is unlearn almost everything our senses and brains tell us about the world, and relearn it almost from scratch.</p>
<p>So it is with hot and cold. In the real world there is no such thing as a &#8220;hot object&#8221; or a &#8220;cold object.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, there really <strong>is</strong> such a thing as temperature. One can speak of &#8220;hotter&#8221; and &#8220;colder&#8221;; if A is hotter than B, then, very simply, A has a higher temperature than B.</p>
<p>But it makes no sense to say &#8220;A <strong><em>is</em></strong> hot&#8221;. The statement that &#8220;A is hot&#8221; is a misconception, a trick that our senses play on us.  What this really just means is that, to your skin&#8217;s nerves, &#8220;A <strong><em>feels</em></strong> hot&#8221;. And what that usually means, in the real world, is &#8220;A is hotter &#8212; has a higher temperature &#8212; than your skin&#8221;.  As always the full story&#8217;s a bit more complicated, but not too much.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s always good when you can do a simple experiment, on your own, to reveal some basic fact about the world.  There&#8217;s a nice one in this case. Take three bowls; fill one with ice water (literally, water with ice in it), fill a second with water that&#8217;s almost too hot for you to put your hand in, and fill the third with ordinary tap water that&#8217;s lukewarm. Now put your left hand in the ice water and your right hand in the hot water. After a minute or so, take them out and put them both in the tepid water. How hot is that water?</p>
<p>You will find you are of two minds. Your cold hand will feel the tepid water is hot, and your hot hand will feel it is cold. And this is because the tepid water is hotter than your cold hand, and colder than your hot hand. Thus you may easily learn: what you feel as hot and cold is <em>not a measure of the world, but rather a measure of <strong>you relative to</strong> the world.</em></p>
<p>In other words, we humans are not thermometers; our nerves and brains don&#8217;t tell us the temperature of a thing, just whether it is hotter or colder than some temperature we find comfortable. <em>[In fact our nerves don&#8217;t even tell us how much hotter or colder another object is; they actually tell us something about how quickly heat is flowing out of or into our bodies from the object that we&#8217;re sensing, which is why, when you pull clothing from a hot clothes dryer, the metal zipper feels so much hotter than the cloth does. But more on that another time.]</em></p>
<p><strong>So what is temperature?</strong></p>
<p>In most ordinary situations, you can think of temperature in a simple way (though I should note that a more sophisticated view is sometimes needed.) Every material object that we find around us &#8212; tables, air, bricks, glass, alcohol &#8212; is made from <a title="Atoms: Building Blocks of Molecules" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/atoms-building-blocks-of-molecules/" target="_blank">molecules</a> characteristic of that material. In any material, the molecules, vastly too small for you and I to see, are moving, fast and randomly, and banging into each other. Some are moving faster than others, and they&#8217;re heading in all directions. In a solid, they don&#8217;t move far; they just rattle in place. In a liquid or gas, they can move all around, but they don&#8217;t go far without banging into each other, and when they collide their speed and direction change. Because they&#8217;re constantly running into each other, each molecule is moving sometimes faster, sometimes slower&#8230; but the molecules never stop moving.</p>
<p><em>[This might confuse your intuition. You&#8217;re used to large objects that you can see, like soccer balls and cardboard boxes and pens, slowing down and stopping. That&#8217;s because, on the Earth&#8217;s surface, large objects generally end up sliding over the ground or the floor, and friction slows them down. Molecules aren&#8217;t subject to friction, so they keep moving. In fact friction is a process in which large objects gradually lose their motion-energy (technically, &#8220;kinetic&#8221; energy) and hand it over to molecules!]</em></p>
<p>The temperature of an ordinary material is simply <strong><em>a measure of the average amount of random, invisible motion that the molecules in that material are undergoing</em></strong>, or, more precisely, <em><strong>a measure of the average speed and motion-energy that those molecules have. </strong> </em>Molecules in colder objects move more slowly than molecules in hotter objects; that&#8217;s all there is to temperature!</p>
<p>Here again, our senses fail us. Look at the table in front of you. Your senses do not tell you that the molecules in that table are randomly wiggling around. Of course your senses don&#8217;t even tell you that the table is made from molecules, so it&#8217;s not surprising they don&#8217;t reveal their motion&#8230; but there aren&#8217;t even apparent fuzzy edges to the table, which you might have naively expected. And our senses don&#8217;t tell us that even on a calm day, with no wind, the molecules of the air surrounding us are zipping around at a cool 1600 feet (500 meters) <em><strong>per second</strong></em> &#8212; faster than the speed of sound, and around five times the wind speeds of the most powerful hurricanes.</p>
<p>This incredible rain of molecules against your body doesn&#8217;t knock you over because, unlike hurricane wind, which pushes you in a particular direction, the random motions of the molecules push you in all directions, and therefore, in no direction at all. The molecules do exert pressure on your skin, but your body pushes back; if it didn&#8217;t it would collapse, so of course evolution has assured that it does.  Yet your senses don&#8217;t even bother to tell you that all this is happening.  Why?  Because this pressure is just part of the scenery of being alive on the surface of the Earth, and your survival doesn&#8217;t depend upon you knowing about it, anymore than it depends upon you knowing that molecules exist at all.</p>
<p><strong>How much hotter is Florida than Minnesota?</strong></p>
<p>Now that it&#8217;s clear what temperature is, we can ask how large, really, is the change from the 84ºF (29ºC) [301 K] temperature felt in daytime in southern Florida and the -40ºF (-40ºC) [233 K] temperatures felt in early morning in northern Minnesota? The temperature difference, subtracting the colder number from the hotter one, sounds dramatic, but doesn&#8217;t answer to the question. We have to focus something else.</p>
<p>For this purpose, the outdated Fahrenheit scale is hopeless. The number of degrees doesn&#8217;t correspond to anything very easy to remember. You just have to memorize how the Fahrenheit scale works: water boils at 212ºF and freezes at 32ºF, and that&#8217;s for weird historical reasons.</p>
<p>The Centigrade, or Celsius, system (Celsius invented it in 1743) is much easier to remember, and almost the whole world uses it in daily life. 0ºC is where water freezes; 100ºC is where it boils. But while that&#8217;s convenient when you want to know if the temperature is below freezing, it&#8217;s not convenient to determine the answer to our question.</p>
<p>No, if you want to understand really how much hotter is air at 84ºF (29ºC) than air at -40ºF (-40ºC), you need the Kelvin scale. The Kelvin scale is very easy to use.  For one thing, it&#8217;s really the same as the number of degrees in Centigrade/Celsius scale, <strong>plus 273.15</strong> &#8212; and that&#8217;s it. I&#8217;ll just approximate this shift by 273, to keep my numbers simple.</p>
<p>Thus water</p>
<ul>
<li>freezes at 273 K, and</li>
<li>boils at 100 + 273 = 373 K.</li>
</ul>
<p>What&#8217;s this magic number &#8220;273.15&#8221;? Well, 0 K = -273.15 ºC = -459.67 F is the temperature at which <strong>the amount of motion-energy per molecule reaches zero, and the molecules stop moving.</strong> <em>[Almost true! Due to the jitter inherent in quantum mechanics, the molecules never <strong>quite</strong> stop moving, and the motion-energy is never <strong>quite</strong> zero. But the motion and the motion-energy are far too small for us to worry about for today.]</em> In other words, it is impossible to have a lower temperature than zero Kelvin! This lowest possible temperature is called &#8220;absolute zero&#8221;, which is why the Kelvin scale starts there. 0 K simply corresponds to the lowest possible motion-energy per molecule, which for most practical purposes might as well be literally zero.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s the advantage of the Kelvin scale: <strong>the temperature of the object in Kelvin is directly proportional to the energy of its molecules.</strong> An object with a temperature of 200 K has twice as much motion-energy per molecule as one with a temperature of 100 K, and half as much motion-energy per molecule as one with a temperature of 400 K.</p>
<p>Well, that suggests to us how we should answer the question: How much hotter is object B than object A? Now that we have a scale for which all temperatures are positive, we can take a ratio of their two temperatures, T<sub>B</sub>/T<sub>A</sub>. If B is hotter than A, the ratio is greater than 1; if B is colder, the ratio is less than 1.  If that ratio is, say, 1.2 &#8212; if the temperature of B is 20% larger than the temperature of A &#8212; that tells us that the molecules in B have energy 20% larger than those in A. <strong><em>Remember this is only true if we use the Kelvin scale, and not Fahrenheit or Celsius</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the reason not to use the temperature <em>difference</em>, T<sub>B</sub> &#8211; T<sub>A</sub>, is that its meaning is ambiguous. A difference of 5 K would be very large if B is at 6 K and A at 1 K &#8212; B is six times hotter than A &#8212; but would be a tiny effect if B is at 60,000 K and A is at 59,995 K, in which case the difference in the two temperatures is a very small fraction of a percent.</p>
<p>I hope you now begin to see why scientists use the Kelvin scale. It is a scale that relates a property of <em>visible macroscopic</em> objects, as measured in <strong>temperature</strong>, to the level of activity of the <em>invisible microscopic molecules</em> out of which the objects are made, as measured in <strong>motion-energy</strong> (or &#8220;kinetic&#8221; energy). If the temperature is large, so is the energy per molecule; as one drops to zero, so does the other.</p>
<p><strong>So how cold is this week&#8217;s cold snap?</strong></p>
<p>Yesterday, in southern Florida the high temperature was 301 K, and the low temperature was 233 K in northern Minnesota. The ratio of the two temperatures is simply 301/233 = 1.29. We may say that Florida was as much as 29% hotter than Minnesota, meaning, specifically, that the average air molecule in Miami in the afternoon had 29% more energy than the average air molecule in Duluth at dawn.</p>
<p>Is that a lot, or not? Motion-energy increases as speed <strong>squared</strong> <em>(E<sub>motion </sub>= ½mv², for an object of mass m traveling at a speed v that is much slower than the speed of light)</em> so it only takes 14% more speed to give you 29% more motion-energy.  That means a car driving 68 miles per hour (114 km/hour) has 29% more motion-energy than a car driving 60 miles per hour (100 km/hour).  So think about that when you are commuting to work. <strong><em>When you accelerate from 60 to 68 miles per hour, you&#8217;ve increased your speed by enough to turn this morning&#8217;s Duluth into this afternoon&#8217;s Miami.  </em></strong></p>
<p>That said, the molecules are a bit speedier.  Compared to those slow-pokes in Duluth, which crawl along at a mere 980 miles per hour (1640 km/hour), the average molecule in Miami is traveling about 1100 miles per hour (1850 km/hour), about 14% faster.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s a matter of perspective.  Biologically speaking, the difference between Florida and Minnesota is enormous; you can survive in one for months, and in the other for minutes.  This is in large part because between comfortable Key West and dangerous Duluth lies the temperature where water turns to ice, and so your body, being more than half water, will start to freeze solid in the cold, not to mention being unable to maintain the internal warmth it needs to function.  And yet, for the nitrogen and oxygen molecules in the air, the cool-down is a rather small change&#8230; no more than slowing down on the highway from 68 miles an hour to 60 miles an hour (114 km per hour to 100 km per hour.)   They barely notice the difference!</p>
<p>We should be very grateful to live on such a stable planet, whose hottest surface temperature (about 130ºF= 54ºC = 328 K) and coldest surface temperature (about -130ºF = -90ºC = 183 K) are only different by a factor of 328/183 = 1.8 &#8212; and of course those temperatures are unusual, and only occur in unique places.  Compare that with the Moon, where high temperatures (214ºF = 101ºC = 374 K) and low temperatures (-300ºF = -184ºC = 89 K) vary by a factor of 374/89 = 4.2.  Out in the wider universe, it&#8217;s a little more drastic. The center of the sun reaches a blazing temperature of 27,000,000ºF = 15,000,000ºC = 15,000,000 K (approximately).  Meanwhile the ancient photons (the particles of electromagnetic radiation which make up the &#8220;cosmic microwave background&#8221;) that fill outer space would warm you to just under 3 K. The ratio of the two temperatures is about 5,000,000.</p>
<p>Home Sweet Home.  Even when it runs a little cold.</p>

<p><em>My own view? Our uncontrolled experiments on our one and only planet must be curbed.  Scientific evidence from many quarters show definitively that the Earth is warming.  Science can give us arguments, strong but not airtight, that we may be responsible (mainly via carbon emissions, and the greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide).  It cannot tell us reliably how bad the risks of a warmer Earth will be; there are too many uncertainties.  But it seems to me that these are risks we shouldn&#8217;t be taking, period.  We don&#8217;t get to mail-order another planet if we mess this one up.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was sent or came across a few interesting links that relate to things covered on this blog and/or of general scientific interest.</p>
<p>It was announced yesterday that <a href="http://eps-hepp.web.cern.ch/eps-hepp/PrizeAnnouncements/hep2013/press-release-2013-en.pdf" target="_blank">the European Physical Society 2013 High Energy Physics Prize was awarded</a> to the collaboration of experimental physicists that operate the ATLAS and CMS experiments that <a title="Discovery of the Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-discovery-of-the-higgs/" target="_blank">discovered a type of Higgs particle</a>, with special mention to Michel Della Negra, Peter Jenni, and Tejinder Virdee, for their pioneering role in the development of ATLAS and CMS.  Jenni and Virdee are both at the LHCP conference in Barcelona, which I&#8217;m also attending, and it has been a great pleasure for all of us here to be able to congratulate them in person .</p>
<p>One thing that came up a couple of times regarding weather forecasting (for instance, in forecasting the path of Hurricane Sandy) is that the <a title="Another Storm Predicted" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/11/05/another-storm-predicted/" target="_blank">European weather forecasters are doing a much better job of predicting storms a week in advance than U.S. forecasters are</a>.  And I was surprised to learn that one of the the main reasons is simple: <a href="http://cliffmass.blogspot.com.es/2012/12/rebuilding-national-weather-service.html" target="_blank">U.S. forecasters have less computing power than their European counterparts</a>, which sounds (and is) ridiculous.  The new director of the U.S. National Weather Service, Louis Uccellini, has been successful in his goal of improving this situation, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/16/us-usa-weather-idUSBRE94F00320130516" target="_blank">as reported here</a>.  <em>[Thanks to two readers for pointing me to this article.]</em></p>
<p>One of the possible interpretations of the new class of high-energy neutrinos reported by IceCube (<a title="Possible Important Discovery at IceCube" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/05/16/possible-important-discovery-at-icecube/" target="_blank">see yesterday&#8217;s post</a>) is that they come from the slow decay of a small fraction of the universe&#8217;s dark matter particles, assuming those particles have a mass of a couple of million GeV/c². <em>[That&#8217;s much heavier than the types of dark matter particles that most people are currently looking for, in searches that I discussed in <a title="Current Hints of Dark Matter (4/13)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/dark-matter/current-hints-of-dark-matter-413/" target="_blank">a recent article</a>.]</em>  I didn&#8217;t immediately mention this possibility (which is rather obvious to an expert) because I wanted a couple of days to think about it before generating a stampede or press articles.  But, not surprisingly, people who were paying more attention to what IceCube has been up to had recently written <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.7320" target="_blank">a paper on this subject</a>.  <em>[Here&#8217;s <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.1790" target="_blank">an older, related paper, but at much lower energy</a>; maybe there are other similar papers that I don&#8217;t know about?]</em>  At the time these authors wrote this paper, only the two highest energy neutrinos &#8212; which have energies that, within the uncertainties of the measurements, might be equal (see Figure 2 of <a title="Possible Important Discovery at IceCube" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/05/16/possible-important-discovery-at-icecube/" target="_blank">yesterday&#8217;s post</a>) &#8212; were publicly known.  In their paper, they predicted that (just as any expert would guess) in addition to a <em>spike</em> of neutrinos, all at about 1.1 million GeV, one would also find a population of <em>lower</em>-energy neutrinos, similar to those new neutrinos that IceCube has just announced. So yes, among many possibilities, it appears that it <strong>is</strong> possible that the new neutrinos are from decaying dark matter.  If more data reveals that there really is a spike of neutrinos with energy around 1.1 million GeV, and the currently-observed gap between the million-GeV neutrinos and the lower-energy ones barely fills in at all, then this will be extremely strong evidence in favor of this idea&#8230; though it will be another few years before the evidence could become convincing.  Conversely, if IceCube observes any neutrinos near but significantly <em>above</em> 1.1 million GeV, that would show there isn&#8217;t really a spike, disfavoring this particular version of the idea.</p>
<p>Regarding <a title="Possible Important Discovery at IceCube" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/05/16/possible-important-discovery-at-icecube/">yesterday&#8217;s post</a>, it was pointed out to me that when I wrote &#8220;<em>The only previous example of neutrinos being used in astrophysics occurred with <a title="Supernovas and Neutrinos" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/09/20/supernovas-and-neutrinos/" target="_blank">the discovery of neutrinos from the relatively nearby supernova, visible with the naked eye, that occurred in 1987</a>,&#8221;</em> I should also have noted that neutrinos were and are used to understand the interior of the sun (and vice versa).  And you could even perhaps say that atmospheric neutrinos have been used to understand cosmic rays (and vice versa.)</p>
<p>In sad news, in the &#8220;all-good-things-must-come-to-an-end&#8221; category, the Kepler spacecraft, which has brought us an unprecedented slew of discoveries of planets orbiting other stars, may have reached the end of the line (<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2013/may/16/search-earth-wheels-kepler-mission" target="_blank">see for example here</a>), at least as far as its main goals.  It&#8217;s been known for some time that its ability to orient itself precisely was in increasing peril, and it appears that it has now been lost.  Though this has occurred earlier than hoped, Kepler survived longer than its core mission was scheduled to do, and its pioneering achievements, in convincing scientists that <a href="http://kepler.nasa.gov/news/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&amp;NewsID=94" target="_blank">small rocky planets not unlike our own</a> are very common, will remain in the history books forever.  Simultaneous congratulations and condolences to the Kepler team, and good luck in getting as much as possible out of a more limited Kepler.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re gearing up for another big-time storm predicted for the northeastern United States &#8212; <a title="Sandy: Amazing.  Science: Amazing." href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/10/31/sandy-science-amazing/" target="_blank">we&#8217;ve had more than we need over recent months</a> &#8212; so before we perhaps lose power (or you do)&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;I want to remind you that <a href="http://preposterousuniverse.com/" target="_blank">Sean Carroll</a> and I were interviewed last night by science writer Alan Boyle.  My impression is that the conversation (which touched on issues involving the <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">Higgs particle</a>, <a title="Dark Matter Around the Corner?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/11/29/dark-matter-around-the-corner/" target="_blank">dark matter</a>, and the nature of science as a process) went well, and I hope that you enjoy it.  Just click on this link <a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/virtually-speaking-science/2013/02/07/sean-carroll-matt-strassler-alan-boyle" target="_blank">http://www.blogtalkradio.com/virtually-speaking-science/2013/02/07/sean-carroll-matt-strassler-alan-boyle</a> , endure the commercial, and you should get the radio broadcast (just about 60 minutes).</p>
<p>As for that big blizzard threatening Boston with over two feet (0.6 meters) of snow, and winds over 60 miles (100 km) per hour, along with some coastal flooding, it is interesting that the European Weather Model, which did the better job on forecasting Hurricane Sandy, appears to be doing better on this one too.  The US-based Global Forecasting System may again have been a bit late to the party.  <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/11/05/another-storm-predicted/" target="_blank">The difference in the scientific approach of the two forecasting models was described in a previous post</a>, after Sandy, thanks to one of my readers; if you missed it then, you may find it worth a read now.</p>
<p>Well, it will be interesting to see how the reality plays out; but given how well the European model forecast Sandy, it would seem prudent not to underestimate this storm.  Be careful out there!</p>
<p><em>[Note Added: Julianne Dalcanton, professor of astronomy at the University of Washington, pointed me to her university colleague <a href="http://cliffmass.blogspot.com/2013/01/fixing-national-weather-services.html" target="_blank">Cliff Mass&#8217;s article about various problems at the US National Weather Forcasting agency</a>.  See also <a href="http://cliffmass.blogspot.com/2012/12/rebuilding-national-weather-service.html" target="_blank">this article</a>.  This is seriously disturbing stuff, if you live in the U.S.]</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The greater New York region, having been broken into disconnected and damaged pieces by Hurricane/Nor&#8217;Easter Sandy, is still reassembling itself.  Every day sees improvements to electrical grids and mass transit and delivery of goods, though there have been many hard lessons about insufficient preparations.  Here&#8217;s an impressive challenge: over a million people and thousands of businesses lack electrical power; therefore many of them are running generators, to stay warm, keep food cold, and so forth; but the generators require fuel, typically diesel or gasoline; and so there is a greater need for fuel than usual; but a significant fraction of the petrol stations can&#8217;t pump fuel for their customers&#8230; because they lack electrical power and don&#8217;t have their own generators. These and other nasty surprises of post-storm recovery should be widely noted by policy makers and the public everywhere, especially in places that, like New York when I was a child, rarely experience disasters.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, another storm (a simple nor&#8217;easter) is now forecast for mid-week. While much weaker than the last, it is potentially still a dangerous situation for a region whose defenses are still being repaired.  <a title="Sandy: Amazing.  Science: Amazing." href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/10/31/sandy-science-amazing/" target="_blank">As was the case with Sandy</a>, the new storm was already signaled a week in advance by the ECMWF (<a href="http://www.ecmwf.int" target="_blank">European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasting</a>), the current European weather-forecasting computer program or &#8220;model&#8221;.  Confidence in the prediction has been growing, but still, predictions so far in advance do change.  Also one must keep in mind that a shift in the storm&#8217;s track of one or two hundred miles or so could very much change its impact, so the consequences of this storm, even if it occurs, are still very uncertain.  But again we are reminded, as we were last week, that <a title="Guest Post: Anand Gnanadesikan, Oceanographer" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/10/29/guest-post-anand-gnanadesikan-oceanographer/" target="_blank">weather forecasting has dramatically improved compared to thirty years ago</a>; the possibility of a significant storm can now often be noted a week in advance.</p>
<p>What is this European ECMWF model? what is its competitor, the US-based GFS (<a href="http://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/index.php" target="_blank">Global Forecast System</a>) model? And what about the other models that also get used?   All of these are computer programs for forecasting the weather; all of them use the same basic weather data as their starting point, and all have the same basic physics of weather built into their computer programs.  So what makes them different, and more or less reliable than one another?  I asked one of my commenters, Dan D., about this after <a title="Sandy: Amazing.  Science: Amazing." href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/10/31/sandy-science-amazing/" target="_blank">my last post</a>.  Here&#8217;s what he said, along with my best (and hopefully accurate) attempts at translation for less experienced readers:<span id="more-4873"></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#339966;"><em>Both the GFS and ECMWF models are global models based on the primitive equations (i.e. the Navier-Stokes equations plus the thermodynamic energy equation and mass conservation equation), and both initialize their grids with mostly the same atmospheric data gathered from around the globe.</em></span></p>
<p>Editor&#8217;s translation: this means that they use the basic physics equations for the motion of fluids (such as air and water vapor), of energy, and of mass; and they both start with the same type of weather data taken from around the world.</p>
<p><span style="color:#339966;"><em>One main difference between the two is the grid resolution. The GFS runs at a grid resolution of roughly 27 km in the horizontal, while the ECMWF runs at roughly 16 km (technically both don’t actually use grids, but rather spectral decomposition; the above are the effective grid spacings). All other things being equal, having a finer grid spacing will generally improve your forecast, since you can resolve more of the relevant weather features at smaller scales. This is assuming that your assumptions about the subgrid scale features are still valid when you change the grid resolution, which is a big assumption. There are other caveats, but I won’t go there.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Editor&#8217;s translation: the atmosphere is far too complicated to be simulated in great detail by a computer program; there just aren&#8217;t big enough computers for that.  Instead, every computer program is designed to make approximations and simplifications.  The approximations made by the ECMWF allow the program to keep track of more of the small details of what the atmosphere is doing, compared to the GFS; this <em>may</em> allow the ECMWF to be more accurate, although this depends on whether its assumptions are ok in other ways.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#339966;"><em>The other big difference between the ECMWF and the GFS, and probably the more significant one, is the method of initialization. Both use statistical variational techniques whereby weather observations are statistically optimally combined (in the least-squares sense) with a background “guess” field for the model state variables (such as temperature, moisture, wind speed and direction, etc.). The GFS takes observations centered around the given initialization time (such as 0000 UTC) and makes an analysis at a single time, using a technique known as 3DVAR. This analysis is then fed into the model grid and the forecast is launched from there. The ECMWF does a very similar thing, except that instead of utilizing an analysis at a single time, it actually uses an enhanced technique known as 4DVAR, wherein the model itself is run forward and backward in time over a certain interval (I think it’s on the order of 6 hours or so, I’d have to check), assimilating observations from within that entire window. The forecast “trajectory” is optimally corrected over several forward-backward iterations to best fit the “trajectory” of the observations within that time window. The final analysis valid at the end of that window is then used to make the subsequent forecast. Because 4DVAR makes use of a longer time window and tries to correct the model forecast trajectory, while 3DVAR merely tries to correct an initial guess valid at a single time, the former generally yields a much more accurate final analysis. The disadvantage is that 4DVAR is far more computationally expensive than 3DVAR, and one needs to create an adjoint (backward-in-time version) of the entire forecast model code, which is nothing short of a nightmare for these very complex codes.</em></span></p>
<p>Editor&#8217;s translation: a useful analogy here would be this: it is as though the GFS is looking at a snapshot of the atmosphere and using the information to predict the future, while the ECMWF is looking at a short video of the atmosphere and making sure that its prediction of the future is consistent with the whole video clip.  This technique, while difficult to implement, assures that ECMWF is more accurate.</p>
<p><span style="color:#339966;"><em>Both of the above contribute to generally superior forecasts by the ECMWF for most situations (in fact, I think a study was done not so long ago in which the ECMWF 4DVAR was used to initialize the GFS forecast model; the results showed a significant improvement in the GFS forecasts, nearly the same accuracy as the typical ECMWF. I’ll see if I can dig it up). The next obvious question is why the GFS doesn’t follow suit with using 4DVAR and higher resolution. The reasons are complex, but partly because (as I see it, at least) the ECMWF center only has to deal with one model, while the U.S. weather enterprise is concerned with multiple models at different scales, and thus has to spread their resources more thinly. The full GFS output is also freely available to anyone, while the ECMWF output is not. Personally, I’d like us in the U.S. to focus on a more unified weather modeling framework, while still keeping everything open access.</em></span></p>
<p>Editor&#8217;s note: I don&#8217;t really know exactly what this means, but it sounds as though the US system is trying to do more than the European one, while the Europeans, while being more focused, have been able to develop more advanced simulation techniques.  Not sure about this.</p>
<p><span style="color:#339966;"><em>Finally, what makes the modern versions of the GFS/ECMWF so much better than their predecessors is a combination of increasing model resolution, better numerical solution techniques, better physical parameterizations of clouds and precipitation, radiation, surface fluxes, and the like, and better initialization procedures (such as 4DVAR). The basic equations that the models are based on, however, have not changed much, only the solution details and how we handle the complex parameterizations of the other important physical phenomena not directly related to fluid flow.</em></span></p>
<p>Editor&#8217;s translation: Although the basic physics that goes into the newer simulation tools isn&#8217;t that different from what was in the older ones, there have been many incremental improvements, on many different fronts.  In other words, it was many small steps, rather than one big one, that makes the newer models better.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My neighborhood of New York City may remain without power for a few more days, but fortunately visible signs of damage are limited &#8212; none of the widespread destruction found along the immediate coast of the city and of nearby communities, where the sea rose and swallowed up land that had not seen salt water in many decades, even centuries.  Many trees are down, and countless houses and businesses are wiped out by the sea&#8217;s wrath, even entire beach communities. The numbers of lost homes are surely in the thousands, if not more, with 100 houses alone destroyed in a runaway fire in the neighborhood of Breezy Point, cut off from firefighters by the storm&#8217;s high water.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many people along the coast, lulled into complacency by the fact that last year&#8217;s Tropical Storm (formerly Hurricane) Irene was a bit less furious along the coast than was forecast, decided not to evacuate. Unfortunately indeed, because the forecast for Hurricane Sandy was worse than for Irene, and this time, there was no lucky break to make the reality of the storm significantly less severe than the worst-case prediction.  I myself know of households who decided to evacuate at the last minute and almost didn&#8217;t make it out alive, and others who rode out the storm and found themselves in considerable danger. That so many people remained in harm&#8217;s way required &#8220;first responders&#8221;, as they are termed here, mainly members of the police and fire departments, to make many rescues, quite a few of which wouldn&#8217;t have been necessary had people heeded the warnings. For risking their lives to save so many others, the first responders are widely and justifiably hailed as heroes.</p>
<p>Also deserving of high praise, in my view, are some of the leading politicians and other civic leaders in our region&#8217;s states and cities.  There are quite of few of them whom I don&#8217;t agree with politically and whom I personally don&#8217;t like very much, but on the whole they all seem very smart.   And in this case they understood the risks, took them seriously, and made prudent decisions to order evacuations of areas in danger and to protect public property.  They deserve a lot of credit for their non-nonsense approach.</p>
<p>But I feel that there&#8217;s an important story that the press is almost ignoring.  There&#8217;s another group of people, little-mentioned in the media, who probably saved more lives and property than anyone else.  I refer to the experts at the National Hurricane Center (<a href="http://nhc.noaa.gov/" target="_blank">NHC</a>), and more generally the various branches of the National Weather Service (<a href="http://www.weather.gov/" target="_blank">NWS</a>) and its parent, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (<a href="http://www.noaa.gov/" target="_blank">NOAA</a>).<span id="more-4856"></span></p>
<p>As I already suggested in <a title="North-East Winds A-Blowin’" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/10/29/north-east-winds-a-blowin/" target="_blank">my post from Monday</a>, we should view the forecast of Hurricane Sandy&#8217;s sudden turn toward the coast of New Jersey, and its transformation from a minor category 1 hurricane into an uncategorizable (but categorical) monster, as a stunning achievement &#8212; a historic success of scientific research.  Actually it appears to be several stunning accomplishments in one: the forecast of the unusual track; the forecast of the unusual increase in strength and size; the forecast of a powerful blizzard in the mountains of West Virginia and other nearby states; and the forecast of the extremely high storm surge along Long Island, northern New Jersey and New York Harbor that would prove to be some of the most damaging elements of the storm.  These forecasts were all of highly complex and interrelated phenomena, and very challenging even for the most advanced scientific methods.</p>
<p>And what amazes me is that the forecasters did this successfully <strong><em>despite never having observed a storm of this type before.</em></strong></p>
<p>This, of course, is how science is supposed to work, when it is at its best.  From studies of simpler examples, focusing on one or two elements at a time, scientists guess equations that allow rudimentary predictions of complex phenomena such as fluids <em>(i.e. gasses and liquids)</em> in general, weather more specifically and hurricanes in particular.  Over time, looking at predictions that have succeeded and others that have failed, they improve the equations, accounting for more and more of the underlying processes.  And finally the equations are good enough that they work most of the time; anyone who follows hurricane forecasting knows that the paths of hurricanes are much more reliably predicted than they were even fifteen years ago.</p>
<p>Yet when the day comes that an unusual combination of events arises &#8212; a hurricane moving north, a blocking air pattern to the east, a strong front to the west, an upper level disturbance moving south, etc. &#8212; and the equations respond by predicting a storm of unprecedented power on an extraordinary track, then even the bravest of scientists has to wonder: have the equations gone mad?  Have they been asked to predict the future in an extreme situation where they cannot be trusted?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure the experts were nervous about their forecast.  But as time went on and all of the different computer models, which are similar in their science but differ in their details, gave more or less the same prediction, they appeared to become more and more confident.  And they got it basically right.</p>
<p>Imagine, for a moment, that no one had invested over the last few decades in hurricane forecasting&#8230; that government-funded long-term research was viewed as a waste of money, and that the only funding provided was for research that was likely to lead to near-term economic benefit.  Well, none of those predictions would have been there for us last weekend.  On Monday, a breezy, raw, rainy fall morning, we all would have gone to work with no special worries&#8230; until we headed home for the evening rush hour.  And then we would have found ourselves stuck on the roads by the tens of thousands in traffic jams, unable to get home, as trees fell and rivers flooded, highways became impassable, electricity went out, subway trains were stopped by rising water, and heaven knows what else.  As the evening high tide arrived in New York and Connecticut, nine feet above normal, and as the storm&#8217;s worst rains and winds pounded the New Jersey Coast, many people would have been trapped, and the number of trains, planes, boats, buses, cars, power plants, homes and businesses that would have been unprotected against water damage would have been enormously higher than it was.</p>

<p>This nightmare isn&#8217;t fiction; it&#8217;s history. Something much like it did happen in 1938, in the <a href="http://www.northshorewx.com/Hurricane19380921.asp" target="_blank">Long Island Express hurricane</a>, though fortunately in a somewhat less populated area.  It didn&#8217;t happen this time, because we had many days of warning.  We were told exactly what to worry about &#8212; that there would be many hours of strong winds and rain, tremendous tree damage, flooding along the coast, feet of snow inland.  In New York City we were warned how high the high tide might be: 6 to 11 feet above normal.  (The actual storm surge was nine feet in New York Harbor, a total tide of nearly 14 feet above low water, easily enough to flood the subway and car tunnels and many streets along the waterfront.)   Thanks to these warnings, people were evacuated from danger zones, trains were moved to high ground, highways that often flood were closed, and resources that were needed for cleanup, especially for restoration of power, were brought into position to be ready as soon as the storm was over.  Just imagine the death and damage we might be reading about today, had this not happened.</p>
<p>All the talk in the media is about the 20 or 30 billion dollars that repairs from this storm might cost.  But even though it can&#8217;t be easily estimated, shouldn&#8217;t there be some discussion of the additional billions, perhaps tens of billions, that the National Hurricane Center saved this country in reduced damage and in reduced loss of productivity&#8230; significantly more money than was spent on the entire NOAA budget this year?  And then there are the lives saved.  Those of us who, thanks to the forecast, chose to evacuate, buy extra food and medicine, stay home from work, put off travel, keep our kids home, invite our elderly relatives to stay, and so forth ought all to send a heartfelt thank you note to the forecasters and to all the people who made those forecasts possible &#8212; everyone from the Hurricane Hunter aviators who fly into hurricanes like Sandy to collect the best possible data about these storms to the no-longer-young scientists who spent decades patiently trying to understand what makes these storms tick.  They deserve to be celebrated for what they are: heroes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Sandy approaches the coast I am very thankful for my former colleagues at the <a href="http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/" target="_blank">Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Lab</a> who have spent decades trying to make better predictions of tropical cyclones. And the colleagues around the world who have spent decades developing the techniques of observing and modeling the physics of cyclones. Both the recurving of the storm and the high storm surge (currently already at major flood levels at a number of points between NY and DE) would have taken tens of thousands of people, at a minimum, by surprise. Kurihara&#8217;s first paper in the line of research that led to today&#8217;s prediction (<a href="http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/bibliography/results.php?author=1061" target="_blank" rel="nofollow nofollow">http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/bibliography/results.php?author=1061</a>) was in 1965. It took him almost a decade to get to the first three-dimensional model of a hurricane and another couple of decades to improve the models to the point where they showed useful skill.</p>
<div>Just a little plug &#8212; it is important to remember that this kind of event, low-probability, high impact, is what well-run government is for. Putting together a storm-surge warning system for NY Harbor is not something that a private company is likely to do &#8212; the chances of it being used in any given 10-year period are so small as to make it a worthless investment. And the research that goes into making a forecast like this involves understanding of small-scale turbulence, understanding the transfer of radiation through the atmosphere and its interaction with multiple scatterers and absorbers, figuring out how to put weather satellites into orbit and keep them running, figuring out how to incorporate this information in computer codes, getting these codes to run reproducibly on large numbers of processors&#8230; almost all of this was accomplished by people working on the government dime.</div>
