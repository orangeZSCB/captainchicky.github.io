										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week I attended the <a href="http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/events/2014/sackler/" target="_blank">Eighth Harvard-Smithsonian Conference on Theoretical Astrophysics, entitled &#8220;Debates on the Nature of Dark Matter&#8221;</a>, which brought together leading figures in astronomy, astrophysics, cosmology and particle physics. Although there wasn&#8217;t much that was particularly new, it was a very useful conference for taking stock of where we are. I thought I&#8217;d bring you a few selected highlights that particularly caught my eye.<span id="more-7668"></span></p>
<p><strong>Does Dark Matter Exist, and In What Form?</strong></p>
<p>First, the question of whether dark matter even exists was nicely explored by Stacy McGaugh, from the University of Maryland, who gave a talk on the possibility that the laws of gravitation and/or motion are altered, along the lines suggested by Mordechai Milgrom. The theoretical approach of Milgrom is usually called &#8220;MOND&#8221;: MOdified Newtonian Dynamics; it involves an <em>ad hoc</em> change in the laws of motion when objects exceed a certain rate of acceleration. McGaugh, who is an astronomer, gave a careful illustration of how MOND à la Milgrom explains some odd features of galaxies. This involves careful examination of how stars rotate around the centers of galaxies of all sizes, from the very large to the very small. He emphasized that the hypothesis that galaxies are made mostly of dark matter, and embedded within a large clump of the stuff, does not easily explain these features (though interestingly professor Alyson Brooks of Rutgers University mentioned that her simulations of galaxy formation, which <em>assume</em> the presence of dark matter, do actually reproduce one of these features.) He also showed that, by contrast, MOND doesn&#8217;t do well at all with certain cosmological data, especially in properties of the cosmic microwave background. It was nice to see the evidence for and against MOND laid out in a single, well-delivered talk; it&#8217;s important to look at this question in an even-handed way, so that both the weaknesses and strengths of the dark matter hypothesis are clear.</p>
<p>But in his Wednesday evening talk, the famous astrophysicist and cosmologist Jim Peebles pointed out just how broad is the cosmological evidence for dark matter, from a wide variety of independent sources. He views the basic notion of dark matter as an idea that is not just widely accepted, but has been established by data. But he also suggested, alluding to the many puzzles about galaxies (some of which were mentioned in McGaugh&#8217;s talk) that we should view our understanding of galaxies and how they form and evolve as still quite poor, with room for significant surprises.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, not that much time was spent during the conference on the possibility that dark matter is in the form of waves in a type of field called an axion. And almost nothing was said about the possibility that dark matter is made from other types of objects, such as primordial black holes.  But I guess one can&#8217;t cover everything in a 3½ day conference&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>So Many Hints, So Little Time</strong></p>
<p>A lot of the presentations, discussion and debate concerned the hints of dark matter that have been coming and going like clouds on a windy day.</p>
<p>Anyone who still believes, after the limits from XENON100 and <a title="Breaking News: Two Great New Measurements" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/30/breaking-news-two-great-new-measurements/" target="_blank">the devastating blow from LUX</a>, that the <a title="Current Hints of Dark Matter (4/13)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/dark-matter/current-hints-of-dark-matter-413/" target="_blank">hints of dark matter seen by DAMA/LIBRA, COGENT, CDMS, CRESST</a>, etc. might be due to something real now also has to confront the non-observation of any such hint by Super-CDMS &#8212; an upgrade of the CDMS detector.  While not as powerful as LUX for large-mass particles, Super-CDMS is both more powerful and more robust for detecting dark-matter particles with masses in the 2 &#8211; 10 GeV range.  LUX and XENON100, which use liquid xenon as a target, are very different in their technology from the experiments that see hints.  These all use solid targets made mostly from smaller atomic nuclei than xenon, and this could allow one to dream that dark matter is of a sort that would show up in experiments such as DAMA more easily than in xenon-based experiments. But Super-CDMS uses a germanium target, and germanium nuclei are quite a bit lighter than xenon nuclei; so this argument is no longer so persuasive.  Yes, it is still perhaps possible to imagine dark matter that would give hints at DAMA/LIBRA or COGENT and escape both the xenon experiments and Super-CDMS; but it is looking increasingly contrived.</p>
<div style="width: 566px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/2602b-plotsupercdms.png?w=556&#038;h=445" alt="" width="556" height="445" border="0" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Result from super-CDMS from late February, shown at Dark Matter 2014. Plot shows dark matter scattering rate versus the dark matter particle&#8217;s mass; all regions above the solid and dashed lines are ruled out, according to the experiment labeling the line. Hints of dark matter are shown in the orange, blue, pink and yellow regions. (The green regions can be ignored by non-experts.)  All of the hints are ruled out by both LUX and Super-CDMS (marked &#8220;This result&#8221;). Explanations for the hints that evade both LUX and Super-CDMS are not easy to come by.</p></div>
<p>Meanwhile, the possibility of dark matter annihilating in the center of the galaxy and resulting in unexpected numbers of positrons is suggested by an unexpected number of positrons, relative to electrons, at energies of 10 &#8211; 300 GeV. This effect was first noticed by the PAMELA experiment, and then confirmed by FERMI, after which it was <a title="AMS Presents Some First Results on Cosmic Rays and Dark Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/04/03/ams-presents-some-first-results/">carefully measured by AMS</a>. But is this effect from dark matter, from pulsars <em>[for a definition, see below]</em>, from <a title="Supernovas and Neutrino Speeds" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/neutrinos-faster-than-light/opera-some-arguments-against/supernovas-and-neutrino-speeds/" target="_blank">supernova</a> remnants, or just simply from cosmic rays? There were three very different talks on this question, with very different viewpoints.  Personally, I wouldn&#8217;t bet on dark matter here&#8230;</p>
<p>Yet another hint of dark matter &#8212; an excess of photons of energy of about 130 <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/" target="_blank">GeV</a> or so from the center of the galaxy, seen in the data from the Fermi satellite &#8212; appears to be going away, despite having reached 5 standard deviations of significance by someone&#8217;s measure. Among those saying so is Christoph Weniger, the researcher who <a title="Dark Matter: Now You See It, Now You Don’t" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/04/20/dark-matter-now-you-see-it-now-you-dont/" target="_blank">first identified this excess a couple of years ago</a>. It isn&#8217;t clear yet whether the excess was a statistical fluke or a detector problem &#8212; the significance of the signal has gone down <em>both</em> because of a reanalysis by Fermi of their data <em>and</em> because there have been no events at 130 GeV for many months. Either way, it seems to be gradually disappearing as more data is collected, and while its cause may become clear in a few years, all we can say for now is &#8220;R.I.P&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>Hint Du Jour Number 1</strong></p>
<p>But two other hints of dark matter are alive and &#8230; well, not dead yet. The first involves an excess of photons (i.e., more photons are observed than expected) in the 1 &#8211; 10 GeV range, originating from a region of the galaxy that extends outward a very substantial distance from the center of the galaxy. These photons, first identified by Goodenough and Hooper <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.2998" target="_blank">here</a>, and most recently explored <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.6703" target="_blank">here</a>, may be a signal of dark matter particles annihilating. <em>(Specifically, when they <a title="Particle/Anti-Particle Annihilation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/particleanti-particle-annihilation/" target="_blank">annihilate</a> they may produce a quark and an antiquark, which in the end produce multiple <a title="What’s a Hadron?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-hadron-as-in-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">hadrons</a>, some of which can <a title="Most Particles Decay — But Why?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/why-do-particles-decay/most-particles-decay-why/" target="_blank">decay</a> to photons.)</em></p>
<p>However, these photons might also be due to something astrophysical. So far, the only known astrophysical candidate is a horde of millisecond <a href="http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/pulsars.html" target="_blank">pulsars</a>. What are those? A neutron star is a giant balls of <a title="The Nuclei of Atoms: At the Heart of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-nuclei-of-atoms-at-the-heart-of-matter/" target="_blank">neutrons</a>, about 20 kilometers across, that is a remnant from a <a title="Supernovas and Neutrino Speeds" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/neutrinos-faster-than-light/opera-some-arguments-against/supernovas-and-neutrino-speeds/" target="_blank">Type II supernova</a> explosion.  A pulsar is a neutron star that has a strong magnetic field and sends beams of electromagnetic radiation into space as it spins; since these beams are only detectable to us when they point in our direction, we see them as pulsing, hence the name &#8220;pulsar&#8221;.  A millisecond pulsar spins 1000 times a second or so (wow!).  These objects can emit very-high-energy photons, as energetic as a few GeV, out into space.</p>
<p>The excess of photons have an energy dependence that looks a bit different from pulsars, but the peak of the distribution occurs at about 2 GeV and drops off around 10 GeV, which is just what pulsar photons would be expected to do.  That makes one immediately suspicious that pulsars are responsible.  That said, the wide distribution in space of these unseen pulsars, and the number of pulsars required, are perhaps surprising.  But pulsar experts tell me that so little is known about pulsars in that region that it would be hard to argue strongly against that possibility.</p>
<p>How can the two possibilities (pulsars vs. dark matter) be distinguished? If this same signal is seen in the dwarf galaxies that surround our galaxy, which should have very few stars but lots of dark matter, it might convince us that the signal is from dark matter and not from pulsars. Conversely, if it isn&#8217;t seen, it is more likely from pulsars.  Maybe.  Well, this hint isn&#8217;t likely to go away soon, nor is it likely to be diagnosed convincingly anytime soon, so we&#8217;ll hear more about it in future.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">The Hint Du Jour Number 2</span></p>
<p>The second hint is from an excess of X-rays with an energy of just about 3500 <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/" target="_blank">eV</a>; these have been identified in various galaxies and clusters of galaxies. <em>(I wrote <a title="X-Rays From Dark Matter? A Little Hint For You To Enjoy" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/02/18/x-rays-from-dark-matter-a-little-hint-for-you-to-enjoy/" target="_blank">an incomplete article about it here</a>; I still owe you a better one.)</em> These X-rays are most popularly suggested to be from dark matter in the form of decaying sterile neutrinos (i.e. neutrino-like particles that are affected by none of the known non-gravitational forces, unlike <a title="How One Detects Neutrinos" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/how-one-detects-neutrinos/" target="_blank">ordinary neutrinos</a> which are affected by the weak nuclear force.) However, as I emphasized to you from the beginning, the same signal could also arise from other types of dark matter. For example, if dark matter particles are, like atoms, able to be &#8220;excited&#8221; (i.e. able to absorb energy and become slightly heavier but unstable versions of themselves), then when two dark matter particles bump into one another, one might become excited, and later decay back to its original state while emitting an X-ray photon.</p>
<p>Alternatively, perhaps this excess is due to an unknown atomic effect, and has nothing to do with dark matter at all.  Again, seeing this excess in dwarf galaxies would be potentially crucial in deciding the issue.   Compared to galaxies the size of the Milky Way, dwarf galaxies have much more dark matter than hot gas, so these X-rays would be seen there only if they are due to dark matter, and not due to atomic physics.</p>
<p>Since either or both of these hints du jour might have to do with astrophysics, not dark matter, we are, yet again, in a waiting game &#8212; waiting for more data, and more convincing data, that might allow one or both of these sources of photons to be fully explained.</p>
<p><strong>Looking for Dark Matter In New Ways</strong></p>
<p>Finally, one of the most interesting things I learned at the conference was explained by professor Rouven Essig of Stony Brook University. He and his team has been working on the problem of detecting dark matter particles much lighter than those that XENON and LUX and Super-CDMS are designed to detect &#8212; as much as 100 to 1000 times lighter. XENON-, LUX-, COGENT- and CMDS-type experiments are best at detecting particles with mass of 5 &#8211; 1000 GeV/c², by picking up signals from the scattering of a dark matter particle off an <em>atomic nucleus</em>. But there&#8217;s a workable strategy, Essig argued, for picking up the scattering of a dark matter particle off an <em>electron</em> in an atom. Detecting dark matter particles with masses down to 10 MeV/c² could soon be possible in XENON/LUX-type detectors, and sensitivity to 1 MeV/c² might someday be possible in CDMS-type (i.e. solid-state) detectors.  This opens a new opportunity to look for dark matter in a form that previously would have slipped through our nets.</p>
<p><strong>The Debates Will Continues</strong></p>
<p>Though dark matter continues to elude our attempts to identify it, many experiments are continuing to seek this mysterious stuff, using a wide variety of methods. We can expect more hints of progress (most of them false alarms) over the coming decade. But can we expect an actual discovery? Only the heavens know.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Still early days in the 2012 data-taking run, which just started a couple of weeks ago, but already the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC] accelerator wizards, operating the machine at <a title="The Benefits of 8 TeV Collisions Over 7 TeV." href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/02/14/8-tev-over-7-tev/">8 TeV of energy per proton-proton collision (compared to last year&#8217;s 7 TeV)</a> have brought the collision rates back up nearly to where they were last year.    This is very good news, in that it indicates there are no significant unexpected technical problems preventing the accelerator from operating at the high collision rates that are required this year.   And the experiments are already starting to collect useful data at 8 TeV.</p>
<p>The challenges for the experiments of operating at 8 TeV and at the 2012 high collision rate are significant.  One challenge is modeling. To understand how their experiments are working, well enough that they can tell the difference between a new physical phenomenon and a badly understood part of their detector, the experimenters have to run an enormous amount of computer simulation, modeling the beams, the collisions, and the detector itself.  Well, 8 TeV isn&#8217;t 7 TeV; all of last year&#8217;s modeling was fine for last year&#8217;s data, but not for this year&#8217;s.  So a lot of computers are running at full tilt right now, helping to ensure that all of the needed simulations for 8 TeV are finished before they&#8217;re needed for the first round of 2012 data analysis that will be taking place in the late spring and early summer.</p>
<p>Another challenge is &#8220;pile-up.&#8221;  The LHC proton beams are not continuous; they consist of up to about 1300 bunches of protons, each bunch containing something like 100,000,000,000 protons.  Collisions in each detector occur whenever two bunches pass through each other, every 50 nanoseconds <em>(billionths of a second).</em>  With the beam settings that were seen late in 2011 and that will continue to intensify in 2012, every time two bunches cross at the center of the big experiments ATLAS and CMS, an average of 10 to 20 proton-proton collisions occur essentially simultaneously.  <em>That means that every proton-proton collision in which something interesting happens is doused in the debris from a dozen uninteresting ones.</em>  Moreover, some of the debris from all these collisions hangs around for a while, creating electronic noise that obscures measurements of future collisions.  One of the questions for 2012 is how much of a nagging problem the increasing pile-up will pose for some of the more delicate measurements &#8212; especially study of <a title="The Higgs FAQ 1.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/360-2/" target="_blank">Higgs particle</a> decays, both <a title="Decays of the Standard Model Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/decays-of-the-standard-model-higgs/" target="_blank">expected ones</a> and <a title="Exotic Decays of the Higgs: A High Priority for 2012" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/01/27/exotic-decays-of-the-higgs-a-high-priority-for-2012/" target="_blank">exotic ones</a>, and searches for relatively light-weight new particles with low production rates, such as particles created only via the weak nuclear force (<em>e.g.</em> <a title="Supersymmetry — What Is It?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/supersymmetry-what-is-it/" target="_blank">supersymmetric partners</a> of the W, Z and Higgs particles.)</p>
<p>But I have a lot of confidence in my colleagues; barring a really nasty surprise, they&#8217;ll manage pretty well, as they did last year.  And so far, so good!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Almost all the news on neutrinos in the mainstream press this past few months was about the OPERA experiment, and a possible violation of Einstein&#8217;s foundational theory of relativity. That the experiment turned out to be wrong didn&#8217;t surprise experts. &#8230; <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/04/09/a-neutrino-success-story/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Almost all the news on neutrinos in the mainstream press this past few months was about <a title="OPERA: The First Few Days" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/neutrinos-faster-than-light/opera-the-first-few-days/" target="_blank">the OPERA experiment, and a possible violation of Einstein&#8217;s foundational theory of relativity</a>. That the experiment <a title="OPERA: What Went Wrong" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/neutrinos-faster-than-light/opera-what-went-wrong/" target="_blank">turned out to be wrong</a> didn&#8217;t surprise experts. But one of the concerns that scientists have about how this story turned out and was reported in the press is that perhaps many non-experts may get the impression that science is so full of mistakes that you can&#8217;t trust it at all. That would be a very unhappy conclusion &#8212; not just unhappy but in fact a very dangerous conclusion, at least for anyone who would like to keep their economy strong, their planet well-treated and their nation well-defended.</p>
<p>So it is important to balance the OPERA mini-fiasco with another hot-off-the-presses neutrino story that illustrates why, even though mistakes in individual scientific experiments are common, collective mistakes in science are rare. A discipline such as physics has intrinsic checks and balances that significantly reduce the probability of errors going unrecognized for long. In the story I&#8217;m about to relate, one can recognize how and why scientists start to come to consensus.  Though quite suspicious of any individual experiment, scientists generally take a different view of a group of experiments that buttress one another.</p>
<p>The context of this story, though much less revolutionary than a violation of Einstein&#8217;s speed limit, still represents a milestone in our understanding of neutrinos, which has been advancing very rapidly over the past fifteen years or so. When I was a starting graduate student in the late 1980s, almost all we knew about neutrinos was that there were at least three types and that they were much lighter than electrons, and perhaps massless. Today we know much, much more about neutrinos and how they behave. And in just the last few months and weeks and days, one of the missing entries in the Encyclopedia Neutrinica appears to have been filled in.<span id="more-3276"></span></p>
<p><strong>The Question</strong></p>
<p>What&#8217;s in question isn&#8217;t so easy to explain; it&#8217;s a tricky bit involving neutrino oscillations.  I wrote a pedagogical article on neutrino types and neutrino oscillations (<a title="Neutrino Types and Neutrino Oscillations" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/neutrino-types-and-neutrino-oscillations/">click here if you want to read it in its entirety</a>), which I recommend you read if you want to understand in a bit more detail what I&#8217;m about to say.  Here I&#8217;m going to make a long story way too short, by simply saying that you can classify the three different types of neutrinos in two different ways.  In the &#8220;weak-type&#8221; classification, the three neutrinos are named &#8220;electron-neutrino&#8221;, &#8220;muon-neutrinos&#8221; and &#8220;tau-neutrinos&#8221;.  Their anti-particles are called anti-neutrinos with the same prefixes.  The names are given according to whether they appear in processes involving electrons, or muons, or taus (or their anti-particles). (<a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">Click here for a reminder about what electrons, muons and taus are</a>.) In particular, if an anti-neutrino is emitted in a process involving an electron, that anti-neutrino is called an <strong><em>electron-antineutrino</em></strong>; if the process instead involves a muon, then the anti-neutrino is a <strong><em>muon-antineutrino</em></strong>.</p>
<p>The physics question that is the subject of this article is the following: as an electron-antineutrino travels along on its own, can it convert (or &#8220;<strong>oscillate</strong>&#8221;) into a muon-antineutrino or tau-antineutrino?  (Or can the reverse process occur, with, say, a muon-neutrino or antineutrino converting to an electron-neutrino or anti-neutrino?)  Certain types of neutrino oscillations have previously been observed, in the context of various types of neutrinos traveling through the sun or through the earth &#8212; but not this particular one.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m oversimplifying quite a bit here, but the full story is long and rather technical.  A very small bit of the technical stuff: In the equations that physicists use for neutrinos, a quantity appears that for historical reasons is called θ<sub>13</sub>.  If it is zero, then electron-antineutrinos will remain as they are.  If it is not zero, then they will &#8220;oscillate&#8221;.  (Again, <a title="Neutrino Types and Neutrino Oscillations" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/neutrino-types-and-neutrino-oscillations/" target="_blank">click here for my article describing what oscillation means in this context</a>.)  So when you read other people&#8217;s articles about this question, you will often see it phrased as asking whether θ<sub>13</sub> is or isn&#8217;t zero.</p>
<p>How could you figure out, through an experiment, whether this type of oscillation occurs?   The trick is to create very large numbers of electron-antineutrinos (for instance, in a nuclear reactor such as one finds in a nuclear power plant). Next, set up a detector, a certain distance away, that is able to detect  electron-antineutrinos (but it won&#8217;t be able to detect the other types, for technical reasons having to do with the low energy carried by anti-neutrinos from a reactor.)  Not that it will detect very many; most of the anti-neutrinos will pass right through the detector, and indeed right through the entire earth, unobserved.  That&#8217;s because neutrinos and anti-neutrinos are unaffected by the <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">electromagnetic force or the strong nuclear force, and can interact with matter only through the weak nuclear force</a>, which is very weak indeed in these contexts <em>(and by gravity, which is ridiculously weak and of no consequence here.)</em>  But because there are <em>so many</em> anti-neutrinos produced by a reactor, a small but measurable number will <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/how-one-detects-neutrinos/" target="_blank">hit something inside a suitably designed detector</a>, allowing them to be observed.</p>
<p>Because the way electron-antineutrinos interact with matter via the weak nuclear force is very well understood, we can predict very accurately how many of them from the reactor would be observed in the detector if they do <strong>not</strong> oscillate.  If oscillation <em>does</em> occur, then fewer will be observed than expected, because a fraction of the electron-antineutrinos, having converted into another type of antineutrino, will be unobservable by the detector.</p>
<p>Actually, the best way to carry out this measurement is not quite the way I just described. What you really want to do is measure the number of electron-antineutrinos observed in <em><strong>two</strong></em> (or more) detectors, located at different distances from the same reactor; see Figure 1. That way, even if you&#8217;ve made a mistake in your understanding of the reactor, or of your detector technology, it won&#8217;t matter; when you take the ratio of how many antineutrinos your <strong>nearby</strong> detector observes compared to how many your <strong>farther</strong> detector observes, those mistakes will cancel out and won&#8217;t affect your measurement of whether oscillation is absent or present, and thus of whether θ<sub>13</sub> is zero or not.</p>

<p><strong>The Answers</strong></p>
<p>In the last few months and weeks, several different experiments have reported on measurements relevant to this question. All of them are finding that <strong>θ<sub>13</sub> is not zero</strong>, and all are consistent with θ<sub>13</sub> being something like 0.16 radians (which is about 9 degrees &#8212; small, but clearly not zero.)  That number may move around a bit with more data, but is very unlikely to drop below 0.08 radians.</p>
<p>The first dramatic evidence was presented in early March, from the <a href="http://dayawane.ihep.ac.cn/twiki/bin/view/Public/" target="_blank">Daya Bay experiment based in China</a> &#8212; a reactor experiment similar to but a bit more elaborate than the sketch shown in Figure 1.  <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.1669" target="_blank">Their result</a>, quite convincing by itself, disagrees with the hypothesis of zero oscillation by more than 5 standard deviations, an amount that by the standards of particle physics convincingly rules out the possibility that θ<sub>13</sub> =0.</p>
<p>But in saying &#8220;this is convincing&#8221;, I am <strong><em>assuming they didn&#8217;t make any mistakes</em></strong>. Should we believe this neutrino experiment more than we believed OPERA? After all, OPERA claimed a 6 standard deviation result <em>(though <a title="OPERA’s Presentation: My Initial Comments" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/neutrinos-faster-than-light/opera-the-first-few-days/operas-presentation-my-initial-comments/" target="_blank">I complained it should have been more like 4</a>, if they&#8217;d been a bit more conservative in their statistical analysis.)  </em>That turned out to be irrelevant, because they&#8217;d made an error.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that one mark against OPERA&#8217;s result was that it was particularly implausible and difficult to fit into existing knowledge. Daya Bay&#8217;s result is a lot more plausible and not in any way inconsistent with other things  we know.</p>
<p>But still, <em>if we only had Daya Bay&#8217;s measurement, then indeed there would be good reason to be patient and cautious</em>. The measurement they are making is difficult. They are observing only a 6% deficit in the number of electron-antineutrinos compared to the number they expected &#8212; a small effect.  You may well be tired of hearing me say that <em><strong>first-time experimental measurements commonly turn out to be wrong</strong></em>, but I&#8217;ll say it again: Daya Bay isn&#8217;t exempt from this caveat.</p>
<p>However, already <em><strong>before</strong></em> Daya Bay produced its result, three pre-cursors to this experiment had reported hints over the past few months that are consistent with what Daya Bay now sees. These were T2K (in Japan), MINOS (in the U.S.A.), and Double Chooz (in France). Double Chooz is also a reactor experiment (as in Figure 1), while T2K and MINOS are accelerator experiments (similar in some ways to OPERA) in which <a title="Making Neutrino Beams" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/making-neutrino-beams/">high-energy muon-neutrinos are produced in one laboratory</a> and a detector in a laboratory hundreds of kilometers away <a title="How One Detects Neutrinos" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/how-one-detects-neutrinos/">tries to measure whether a significant fraction of them convert to electron-neutrinos while in flight</a> &#8212; a process also sensitive to θ<sub>13.</sub></p>
<p>Much more impressively, just a couple of weeks <em><strong>after</strong></em> Daya Bay&#8217;s result was announced, the RENO experiment in Korea (which is a reactor experiment similar to Daya Bay, and had been competing with them, hoping to beat them to the punch) <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.0626" target="_blank">announced <em>its</em> result</a>. What RENO finds is completely consistent with what Daya Bay has measured, and is <del>even just a bit more</del> <em>[after improved analysis, just a bit less]</em> statistically significant.</p>
<p>In short, we have very quickly seen two experiments measure θ<sub>13</sub>  independently, using different nuclear reactors and somewhat different experimental designs, and subject to different potential problems. They both make the measurement as illustrated in Figure 1, as a ratio between what is observed by nearby detectors and what is observed by farther ones; such a technique is reassuringly cushioned from many types of possible errors. They get essentially the same answer (about 0.15 or so in radians). And they were preceded by three experiments that collectively were all already hinting that θ<sub>13</sub> was larger than 0.08 radians or so.</p>
<p>Is it possible that they are all wrong, and that θ<sub>13</sub> is actually zero, or at least much smaller than 0.15 radians? In principle, yes; that possibility is still large enough to be worth remembering. The measurements are not simple. Is it likely? Not very. <em><strong>Not with so much consistent evidence, some of it strong, coming from so many different experiments.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>The Implications</strong></p>
<p>So science has probably made a step forward. It is highly probable that we now know something about neutrinos that we did not know last year. Over time, as RENO and especially Daya Bay (which, because of its design, will pull ahead of its rivals) collect more data, their results will become more  precise and will likely become more and more convincing. The new information will then go gradually from &#8220;highly probable&#8221; to &#8220;near certain.&#8221; We&#8217;ll be watching this process over the next couple of years, though it will be slow and unexciting and will engender little public comment &#8212; unless it stumbles unexpectedly.</p>
<p>In comparing this story to the speedy neutrino saga, we get to see both sides of how science works. Sometimes experiments conflict with each other; first one experiment claims a new result, then others knock it down. So it was with <a title="This Time, ICARUS Really DOES Refute OPERA" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/16/this-time-icarus-really-does-refute-opera/" target="_blank">OPERA and ICARUS</a>.   But sometimes they agree, which provides some confidence in the result. So it is with Daya Bay and RENO, as well as their predecessors.  Both the OPERA/ICARUS story and the Daya Bay/RENO story show science working well, preventing falsehoods from leaking into scientific knowledge, and assuring that only those potential facts that have run a gauntlet of cross-checks are allowed into the textbooks of our children.</p>
<p>One more thing: should you, personally, care about the scientific result of this neutrino success story? Whether θ<sub>13</sub> is zero or not will not keep you awake at night, and the new result does not potentially challenge a hundred years of theoretical physics, as OPERA&#8217;s result might have done had it been correct. But still, it is significant for several reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>a short-term scientific implication</strong>: a non-zero θ<sub>13</sub> makes possible a class of experiments looking for CP violation in neutrinos. (I described what CP violation means in <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/11/16/a-notable-discrepancy-at-the-lhcb-experiment/" target="_blank">a post discussing its appearance in the physics of quarks</a>. ) There are many physicists who believe that CP violation in neutrinos may give deep insights into why the universe has more matter than anti-matter (i.e. more electrons than positrons, and more protons and neutrons than anti-protons and anti-neutrons.) So that experimental program will now go ahead.</li>
<li><strong>a long-term scientific implication:</strong> the measurement of θ<sub>13</sub>  gives us some insight into the processes that might be responsible for neutrinos having the masses that they do.   I call this long-term because we don&#8217;t know what neutrino masses are yet!  (We just know some differences of the squares of masses.)  But many theories of neutrino masses would have predicted  θ<sub>13</sub> much smaller than measured by Daya Bay and RENO, so those theories can now be discarded.</li>
<li><strong>a long-term, long-shot technological implication:</strong> it seems likely to me that someday neutrinos will be a technological tool. The applications will be limited because huge numbers of neutrinos are needed if one is use them to measure anything, but still, neutrinos are the only known measurable particles that can pass through large quantities of rock and potentially convey to us information about what&#8217;s in there. And one can&#8217;t dream broadly about neutrino-based technology without a more complete knowledge of how neutrinos behave.  This most recent information fills in one of the key missing pieces.</li>
<li><strong>other long-term, long-shot scientific implications</strong>: we need a full understanding of neutrinos if we are to use the neutrinos coming from supernovas to learn better how supernovas work (and remember how important supernovas are &#8212; their precursor stars are the furnaces in which many nuclei of the heavier chemical elements are forged, and the supernovas themselves blow those elements across wide expanses of interstellar space, eventually to help form the cores of rocky planets and the bodies of human beings.)  There are likely to be other contexts, too, in which this knowledge is crucial for gaining understanding of phenomena in which neutrinos play a central role.</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe there are other implications that neutrino experts remember that I&#8217;m forgetting right now. But suffice it to say that our children will likely care, indirectly, about this measurement, quite possibly for reasons that we cannot yet imagine.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Monday, during the concluding session of the <a title="At the SEARCH Workshop on the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/18/at-the-search-workshop-on-the-lhc/" target="_blank">SEARCH Workshop</a> on <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC] physics (see also <a title="Latest from the SEARCH Workshop" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/20/latest-from-the-search-workshop/" target="_blank">here</a> for a second post), and at the start of the panel discussion involving a group of six theorists, Michael Peskin, professor of theoretical particle physics at the <a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Stanford Linear Accelerator Center</a> <em>[and my Ph.D. advisor]</em> opened the panel with a few powerpoint slides.  He entitled them: &#8220;My Advice in Four Slogans&#8221; &#8212; the advice in question being aimed at experimentalists at ATLAS and CMS (the two general-purpose experiments at the LHC) as to how they ought best to search for new phenomena at the LHC in 2012, and beyond. Since I agree strongly with his points (as I believe most LHC theory experts do), I thought I&#8217;d tell you those four slogans and explain what they mean, at least to me. <em>[I&#8217;m told the panel discussion will be posted online soon.]</em></p>
<p><strong>1. No Boson Left Behind</strong></p>
<p>There is a tendency in the LHC experimental community to assume that the new particles that we are looking for are heavy &#8212; heavier than any we&#8217;ve ever produced before. However, it is equally possible that there are unknown particles that are rather lightweight, but have evaded detection because they interact very weakly with <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the particles that we already know about</a>, and in particular very weakly with the <a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/" target="_blank">quarks and antiquarks and gluons that make up the proton</a>.</p>
<p>Peskin&#8217;s advice is thus a warning: <em><strong>don&#8217;t just rush ahead to look for the heavy particles; remember the lightweight but hard-to-find particles you may have missed.</strong></em></p>
<p>The word &#8220;boson&#8221; here is a minor point, I think. All particles are either <a title="Fermions and Bosons" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/fermions-and-bosons/" target="_blank">fermions or bosons</a>; I&#8217;d personally say that Peskin&#8217;s slogan applies to certain fermions too.</p>
<p><strong>2. Exclude Triangles Not Points</strong></p>
<p>The meaning of this slogan is a less obscure than the slogan itself.  Its general message is this: if one is looking for signs of a new hypothetical particle which</p>
<ul>
<li>is produced mostly or always in particle-antiparticle pairs, and</li>
<li>can decay in multiple ways,</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>one has to remember to search for collisions where the particle decays one way and the antiparticle decays a different way</em></strong>; the probability for this to occur can be high.  Most LHC searches have so far been aimed at those cases where both particle and anti-particle decay in the same way.  This approach can in some cases be quite inefficient.   In fact, <em><strong>to search efficiently, one must combine all the different search strategies.</strong></em></p>
<p>Now what does this have to do with triangles and points?  If you&#8217;d like to know, jump to the very end of this post, where I explain the example that motivated this wording of the slogan.  For those not interested in those technical details, let&#8217;s go to the next slogan.</p>
<p><strong>3. Higgs Implies Higgs in BSM</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Standard Model is the set of equations used to predict the behavior of all <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the known particles and forces</a>, along with the simplest possible type of Higgs particle (<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/" target="_blank">the Standard Model Higgs</a>.) Any other phenomenon is <strong>by definition</strong> Beyond the Standard Model: <strong>BSM</strong>.]</em></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff6600;"><em> [And yes, one may think of the LHC as a machine for converting theorists&#8217; B(SM) speculations into (BS)M speculations.]</em></span></p>
<p>One of the main goals of the LHC is to find evidence of one or more types of Higgs particles that may be found in nature.  There are two main phases to this search, Phase 1 being the search for the &#8220;Standard Model Higgs&#8221;, and Phase 2 depending on the result of Phase 1.  You can read <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2011/12/06/guest-post-matt-strassler-on-hunting-for-the-higgs/" target="_blank">more about this here</a>.</p>
<p>Peskin&#8217;s point is that <em><strong>the Higgs particle may </strong></em><strong>itself</strong><em><strong> be a beacon, signalling new phenomena not predicted by the Standard Model</strong></em>. It is common in many BSM theories that there are new ways of producing the Higgs particle, typically in decays of as-yet-unknown heavy particles. Some of the resulting phenomena may be quite easy to discover, if one simply remembers to look!</p>
<p>Think what a coup it would be to discover not only the Higgs particle but also an unexpected way of making it! Two Nobel prize-winning discoveries for the price of one!!</p>
<p>Another equally important way to read this slogan <em>(and I&#8217;m not sure why Peskin didn&#8217;t mention it &#8212; maybe it was too obvious, and indeed every panel member said something about this during the following discussion)</em> is that everything about the Higgs particle needs to be studied in very great detail. Most BSM theories predict that the Higgs particle <strong>will</strong> behave differently from what is predicted in the Standard Model, possibly in subtle ways, possibly in dramatic ways. Either its <a title="Production of the Standard Model Higgs Particle" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/production-of-the-standard-model-higgs-particle/" target="_blank">production mechanisms</a> or its <a title="Decays of the Standard Model Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/decays-of-the-standard-model-higgs/" target="_blank">decay rates</a>, or both, may easily be altered. So we should not assume that a Higgs particle that <em>looks</em> at first like a Standard Model Higgs actually <em>is</em> a Standard Model Higgs. <em>(I&#8217;ve written about this <a title="Seeking and Studying the Standard Model Higgs Particle" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/seeking-and-studying-the-standard-model-higgs-particle/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a title="Exotic Decays of the Higgs: A High Priority for 2012" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/01/27/exotic-decays-of-the-higgs-a-high-priority-for-2012/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a title="Lightweight Higgs: A `Sensitive Creature’" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/lightweight-higgs-a-sensitive-creature/" target="_blank">here</a>.)</em> <strong><em> Even a particle that looks very much like a Standard Model Higgs may offer, through precise measurements, the first opportunity to dethrone the Standard Model.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>4. BSM Hides Beneath Top</strong></p>
<p>At the <a title="The Tevatron Comes to an End" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/09/30/the-tevatron-comes-to-an-end/" target="_blank">Tevatron</a>, the LHC&#8217;s predecessor,  top quark/anti-quark pairs were first discovered, but were rather rare. But the LHC has so much energy per collision that it has no trouble producing these particles. ATLAS and CMS have each witnessed about 800,000 top quark/anti-quark pairs so far.</p>
<p>Of course, this is great news, because the huge amount of LHC data on top quarks from 2011 allowed measurements of the top quark&#8217;s properties that are far more precise than we had previously. <em>(I wrote about this <a title="News from La Thuile, with Much More to Come" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/05/news-from-la-thuile-with-much-more-to-come/" target="_blank">here</a>.)</em> But there&#8217;s a drawback. Certain types of new phenomena that might be present in nature may be very hard to recognize, because the rare collisions that contain them look too similar to the common collisions that contain a top quark/anti-quark pair.</p>
<p>Peskin&#8217;s message is that the <strong><em>LHC</em></strong> <strong><em>experimenters need to do very precise measurements of all the data from collisions that appear to contain the debris from top quarks, just in case it&#8217;s a little bit different from what the Standard Model predicts.</em></strong></p>
<p><em>A classic example of this problem involves the search for a <a title="Supersymmetry" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/" target="_blank">supersymmetric</a> partner of a top quark, the &#8220;top squark&#8221;. Unlike the t&#8217; quark that I described a couple of slogans back, which would be produced with a fairly high rate and would be relatively easy to notice, top squarks would be produced with a rate that is several times smaller. [Technically, this has to do with the fact that the t&#8217; would have spin-1/2 and the top squark would have spin 0.] Unfortunately, if the mass of the top squark is not very different from the mass of the top quark, then collisions that produce top squarks may look very similar indeed to ones that produce top quarks, and it may be a big struggle to separate them in the data. The only way to do it is to work hard &#8212; to make very precise measurements and perhaps better calculations that can allow one to tell the subtle differences between a pile of data that contains both top quark/anti-quark pairs and top squark/anti-squark pairs, and a pile of data that contains no squarks at all.</em></p>
<p><strong>Following up on slogan #2: An example with a triangle.</strong></p>
<p>Ok, now let&#8217;s see why the second slogan has something to do with triangles.</p>
<p>One type of particle that has been widely hypothesized over the years is a heavy version of the top quark, often given the unimaginative name of &#8220;top-prime.&#8221; For short, top is written <strong>t</strong>, so top-prime is written <strong>t&#8217;</strong>. The t&#8217; may decay in various possible ways. I won&#8217;t list all of them, but three important ones that show up in many speculative theories are</p>
<ul>
<li>t&#8217; → W particle + bottom quark   (t&#8217; → Wb)</li>
<li>t&#8217; → Z particle + top quark      (t&#8217; → Zt)</li>
<li>t&#8217; → Higgs particle + top quark    (t&#8217; → ht)</li>
</ul>
<p>But we don&#8217;t know <strong>how often</strong> t&#8217; quarks decay to Wb, or to Zt, or to ht; that&#8217;s something we&#8217;ll have to measure. <em>[Let&#8217;s call the probability that a t&#8217; decays to Wb &#8220;P<sub>1</sub>&#8221;, and similarly define P<span style="font-size:xx-small;"><span style="line-height:10px;">2</span></span> and P<span style="font-size:xx-small;"><span style="line-height:10px;">3</span></span> for Zt and ht].</em></p>
<p>Of course we have to look for the darn thing first; maybe there is no t&#8217;. Unfortunately, <em><strong>how we should look for it depends on <em>P<sub>1</sub></em><em>,<sub> </sub></em><em><em>P<span style="font-size:xx-small;"><span style="line-height:10px;">2</span></span></em></em>, <em>and P<span style="font-size:xx-small;">3</span></em>, which we don&#8217;t know</strong></em>. For instance, if P<sub>1</sub> is much larger than P<span style="font-size:xx-small;"><span style="line-height:10px;">2</span></span> and P<span style="font-size:xx-small;"><span style="line-height:10px;">3</span></span>, then we should look for collisions that show signs of producing a t&#8217; quark and a <span style="text-decoration:overline;">t</span>&#8216; antiquark decaying as t&#8217; → W<sup>+</sup> b and <span style="text-decoration:overline;">t</span>&#8216; → W<sup>&#8211;</sup> <span style="text-decoration:overline;">b</span>. Or if P<sub>2</sub> is much larger than P<sub>1</sub> and P<sub>3</sub>, we should look for t&#8217; → Zt and <span style="text-decoration:overline;">t</span>&#8216; → Z <span style="text-decoration:overline;">t</span>.</p>

<p>Peskin has drawn this problem of three unknown probabilities, whose sum is 1, as a triangle.  The three vertices of the triangle, labeled by Wb, Zt and ht, represent three extreme cases: P<sub>1</sub>=1 and P<sub>2</sub>=P<sub>3</sub>=0; P<sub>2</sub>=1 and P<sub>1</sub>=P<sub>3</sub>=0; and P<sub>3</sub>=1, P<sub>1</sub>=P<sub>2</sub>=0. Each point inside this triangle represents different possible non-zero values for P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub> and P<sub>3</sub> (with P<sub>1</sub>+P<sub>2</sub>+P<sub>3</sub> assumed to be 1.)  The center of the triangle is P<sub>1</sub>=P<sub>2</sub>=P<sub>3</sub>=1/3.</p>
<p>Peskin&#8217;s point is that if the experiments only look for collisions where both quark and antiquark decay in the same way</p>
<ul>
<li>t&#8217; → W<sup>+</sup> b and <span style="text-decoration:overline;">t</span>&#8216; → W<sup>&#8211;</sup> <span style="text-decoration:overline;">b</span>;</li>
<li>t&#8217; → Zt and <span style="text-decoration:overline;">t</span>&#8216; → Z <span style="text-decoration:overline;">t</span>;</li>
<li>t&#8217; → ht and <span style="text-decoration:overline;">t</span>&#8216; → h <span style="text-decoration:overline;">t</span>;</li>
</ul>
<p>which is what they&#8217;ve done so far, then they&#8217;ll only be sensitive to the cases for which P<sub>1</sub> is by far the largest, P<sub>2</sub> is by far the largest, or P<sub>3</sub> is by far the largest &#8212; the regions near the vertices of the triangle.  But we know a number of very reasonable theories with P<sub>1</sub>=1/2 and P<sub>2</sub>=P<sub>3</sub>=1/4 &#8212; a point deep inside the triangle.  So the experimenters are not yet looking efficiently for this case.  Peskin is saying that to cover the whole triangle, one has add three more searches, for</p>
<ul>
<li>t&#8217; → W<sup>+</sup> b and <span style="text-decoration:overline;">t</span>&#8216; → Z <span style="text-decoration:overline;">t</span>, or t&#8217; → W<sup>&#8211;</sup>  <span style="text-decoration:overline;">b</span> and t&#8217; → Zt;</li>
<li>t&#8217; → W<sup>+</sup> b and <span style="text-decoration:overline;">t</span>&#8216; → h <span style="text-decoration:overline;">t</span>, or <span style="text-decoration:overline;">t</span>&#8216; → W<sup>&#8211;</sup> b  and t&#8217; → ht;</li>
<li>t&#8217; → Zt and <span style="text-decoration:overline;">t</span>&#8216; → h <span style="text-decoration:overline;">t</span>, or t&#8217; → ht or <span style="text-decoration:overline;">t</span>&#8216; → Z <span style="text-decoration:overline;">t</span>;</li>
</ul>
<p>so as to cover that case (and more generally, the whole triangle) efficiently. Moreover, no one search is very effective; one has to combine them all six searches together.</p>
<p>His logic is quite general.  If you have a particle that decays in four different ways, the same logic applies but for a tetrahedron, and you need ten searches; if two different ways, it&#8217;s a line segment, and you need three searches.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, a commenter asked me a very good question that I realized I hadn&#8217;t yet addressed on this site.  Answering it gives us a chance to look at real data from the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC], and to see what differences will arise the machine&#8217;s energy is <a href="http://press.web.cern.ch/press/PressReleases/Releases2012/PR01.12E.html" target="_blank">increased from 7 TeV to 8</a>.</p>
<p>The protons that are smashed together at the LHC <a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/" target="_blank">are made from many quarks, gluons and antiquarks</a>. The proton-proton collisions take place at a definite energy: 7 <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/" target="_blank">TeV</a> = 7000 GeV in 2011, <a href="http://press.web.cern.ch/press/PressReleases/Releases2012/PR01.12E.html" target="_blank">8 TeV = 8000 GeV  in 2012.</a>  But what we&#8217;re mainly interested in &#8212; what can really create new physical phenomena for us to observe &#8212; are the collisions of a quark in one proton with an antiquark in the other proton, or the collision of two gluons, etc. These &#8220;mini-collisions&#8221; carry only a fraction &#8212; typically a very small fraction &#8212; of the total proton-proton collision energy. <strong><em>How high a fraction can they carry?  <strong><em>and what are the motivations for increasing the energy from 7 TeV per collision to 8 TeV?</em></strong>  </em></strong><a title="Proton Collisions Vs.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2012 may well turn out to be <strong>The Year of The <a title="The Higgs FAQ 1.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/360-2/" target="_blank">Higgs</a>.</strong>  Right now we have very little knowledge about this particle, but that may change dramatically over the year. As I described in <a title="Reviewing the Search for the Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/01/24/reviewing-the-search-for-the-higgs/" target="_blank">my previous post</a>, we&#8217;re coming toward the end of Phase 1 of the Higgs search (where the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC] <a title="The Standard Model Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/" target="_blank">search for the simplest possible form of the Higgs particle, the Standard Model Higgs</a>, or SM Higgs for short.) And we&#8217;re also starting up Phase 2 of the Higgs search. As discussed in <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2011/12/06/guest-post-matt-strassler-on-hunting-for-the-higgs/" target="_blank">my Cosmic Variance guest post</a>, and in more detail in<a title="Reviewing the Search for the Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/01/24/reviewing-the-search-for-the-higgs/" target="_blank"> my most recent post</a>, if a particle resembling the SM Higgs is found, Phase 2 involves <a title="Seeking and Studying the Standard Model Higgs Particle" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/seeking-and-studying-the-standard-model-higgs-particle/" target="_blank">checking its details and determining as well as possible whether it is or isn&#8217;t precisely what is predicted by the Standard Model</a>. If no such particle is found, Phase 2 involves searching widely for the many other types of Higgs particles that nature might or might not possess. Fortunately, despite these apparently divergent aims, the two possible branches of Phase 2 involve asking some of the <em>same</em> experimental questions (see Figure 3 of the <a title="Reviewing the Search for the Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/01/24/reviewing-the-search-for-the-higgs/" target="_blank">most recent post</a>), and so we can start on Phase 2 before even finishing Phase 1. And that is happening now.</p>
<p>One of the things that has to be done in Phase 2 is to search for decays of the Higgs particle that are not among <a title="Decays of the Standard Model Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/decays-of-the-standard-model-higgs/" target="_blank">the decays predicted to occur in the Standard Model</a>.  <em>[&#8220;Decay&#8221; = &#8220;a disintegration of one particle into two or more&#8221;. <a title="Most Particles Decay — But Why?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/most-particles-decay-why/">Click here for an introduction.</a>]</em>  Such &#8220;exotic&#8221; decays are thought of as particularly plausible, because a lightweight Higgs (below about 150 <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/">GeV</a>/c<sup>2</sup> or so) is a very sensitive creature. It is very easy for new particles and/or forces to alter the Higgs&#8217; properties, perhaps causing changes in how (or how often) it is <a title="Production of the Standard Model Higgs Particle" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/production-of-the-standard-model-higgs-particle/">produced</a>, and to what (and with what probability) it may <a title="Decays of the Standard Model Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/decays-of-the-standard-model-higgs/">decay</a>.  As shown in a large number of papers, written by  quite a variety of particle physics theorists, there are many, many types of possible exotic decays, and they can arise for many reasons.  If you&#8217;re curious what kind of exotic decays might occur, I gave a few examples in my now somewhat out-of-date <a title="Implications of Higgs Searches (as of 9/2011)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/implications-of-higgs-searches-as-of-92011/" target="_blank">analysis of what the summer&#8217;s Higgs searches imply</a>. The basic logic of how unusual Higgs decays might arise is still correct in the cases described, but there are many, many more possibilities too. I&#8217;ll have to write a long article about the options in the coming month or so.<span id="more-2455"></span><em> </em></p>
<p><em><em> Another thing I could recommend, especially to graduate students and to those laypersons who are willing to sit through a certain amount of technical mumbo-jumbo enclosed within a largely non-technical discussion, is the first 8 (or even 20.5) minutes of <a href="http://physicslearning2.colorado.edu/tasi/tasi_2010/Videos/Strassler/Lecture5/Lecture5.html" target="_blank">a lecture I gave in 2010 to graduate students</a> who were not Large Hadron Collider [LHC] experts.  (If it loads too slowly you can <a href="http://physicslearning2.colorado.edu/tasi/tasi_2010/tasi_2010.htm" target="_blank">download it from this page</a>; it is my June 18th lecture.) </em></em></p>
<p>You might ask,&#8220;but if there were new particles and forces that could affect Higgs production or its decays, wouldn&#8217;t we have seen signs of them already at other experiments or at least at the LHC itself?&#8221; The answer is &#8220;no!&#8221; Because a lightweight Higgs is so sensitive, the new particles and forces required to alter it may easily be so weakly interacting with ordinary matter, or so heavy, that they can evade detection at all previous experiments and so far at the LHC. The first place they will be discovered is in the properties of the Higgs particle. And so it is very important to measure how the Higgs particle behaves as carefully and precisely as possible!</p>
<p>There are three good reasons why one of the most important strategies to be used in Phase 2 will be to check whether the Higgs has exotic decays &#8212; perhaps common, or perhaps rare.</p>
<ul>
<li>If we don&#8217;t find an SM-like Higgs in Phase 1, it might well be that although there <em>is</em> a Higgs there with SM or near-SM production rates, its decays are not those expected in the Standard Model, but are somehow &#8220;exotic.&#8221;</li>
<li>Conversely, if we do find an SM-like Higgs in Phase 1, <a title="A Truly Spectacular Year at the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/12/14/a-trly-spectacular-year/" target="_blank">we know now</a> that it can only lie above 600 <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/" target="_blank">GeV</a>/c<sup>2</sup> (but this is disfavored) or in the 115-127 GeV/c<sup>2</sup> range, in which case (being lightweight) it may very easily have rare or even common exotic decays.</li>
<li>And if current hints of an SM-like Higgs at 125 GeV/c<sup>2</sup> turn out to be the real thing, we still only know from current data that it <em>roughly</em> looks like an SM-Higgs. If it decays as expected only, say, 85% of the time, and decays exotically, say, 15% of the time, we wouldn&#8217;t know that yet. Our data sets are still far too small, and the hints far too uncertain, to be able to rule that out.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the very least, then, we should be prepared to look for exotic Higgs decays that are perhaps common, or perhaps somewhat rare. These searches might very well be the first to reveal a breakdown of the Standard Model! So we should be preparing for them, and designing them to be as powerful as possible.</p>
<p>&#8220;But slow down,&#8221; you might say. &#8220;We&#8217;re not even sure yet that the Higgs particle is there at all; we&#8217;re still arguing over whether what&#8217;s been seen near 125 GeV/c<sup>2</sup> is a mirage. In 2012 that mirage may take solid form, but even if it does, there will be just barely enough data for confidence in its reality. At such an early stage, how could we ever hope to detect something that the Higgs particle does only rarely?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ah. We need to remember that the Phase 1 searches for the SM Higgs particle <em>themselves</em> rely on things that a Higgs particle does only very rarely. The most important search strategies for the Higgs in 2011 and 2012 will be to look for its <a title="Decays of the Standard Model Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/decays-of-the-standard-model-higgs/" target="_blank">decays</a> to two photons and its decays to &#8220;four leptons&#8221; (shorthand for two lepton/anti-lepton pairs.) If the Higgs has a mass of 125 GeV/c<sup>2</sup>, it decays to two photons only 0.2% of the time. It decays to four leptons only 0.01% of the time. Even its decay to a lepton, anti-lepton, neutrino and anti-neutrino, which is also somewhat useful, is only a few percent effect. All of the decays of the SM Higgs that we can hope to actually measure are rare. The common ones, such as the decay to a bottom quark/anti-quark pair or to a tau lepton/anti-lepton pair, are almost completely drowned in huge backgrounds.  (More accurately, there are in fact clever ways to measure decays to  bottom quarks or to taus, but only by using rare <a title="Production of the Standard Model Higgs Particle" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/production-of-the-standard-model-higgs-particle/" target="_blank">production processes</a>, so these are rare too,  for a different reason.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s well worth going through these numbers a bit more carefully. If indeed there is an SM-like Higgs at 125 GeV/c<sup>2</sup>, produced at the rates expected in the Standard Model, then the number of Higgs bosons produced so far at ATLAS and CMS (separately!) is</p>
<p>the probability of making a Higgs in a 7 <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/" target="_blank">TeV</a> proton-proton collision:</p>
<ul>
<li>0.000,000,000,16</li>
</ul>
<p>times the number of proton-proton collisions in 2011 at ATLAS or CMS:</p>
<ul>
<li>570,000,000,000,000</li>
</ul>
<p>equals the number of Higgs particles produced at ATLAS and at CMS</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>90,000</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Let me say that again.  If nature sports a SM-like Higgs particle with a mass of  125 GeV/c<sup>2</sup>, the number produced so far at ATLAS and CMS is already approaching<span style="color:#ff0000;"> <strong>one hundred thousand</strong></span> in each experiment.</p>
<p>Most of these Higgs particles were not noticed; they disappeared under huge backgrounds, as the planet Venus disappears in bright sunlight.   A few thousand or so decayed (via two W particles) to a lepton, an anti-lepton, a neutrino and an antineutrino; those can be detected, but the backgrounds are large and the measurement is hard. The number of Higgs particles that decay to two photons is something like a few hundred in each experiment, though not all are detected. The number that decay to four leptons is a handful, and some are lost. It&#8217;s the last two very rare processes that give the most striking information in the search for the SM Higgs.</p>
<p>But maybe this new Higgs particle is <strong>not</strong> a <span style="color:#800080;">Standard Model</span> Higgs particle after all, but just looks similar at first glance. Maybe a few dozen, or a few hundred, or a few thousand of the 90,000 Higgs bosons produced in 2011 decayed in an unexpected way, or in one of several unexpected ways. And maybe one of those types of decays gives an experimental signature that we can discover rather easily, giving a signal that stands out above background. All the experimenters might need to do &#8230; is look. Maybe they don&#8217;t even need more data; just searching through the 2011 data might be enough. All the focus last year was on pushing Phase 1 of the Higgs search as far as possible. But Phase 2 can start with <strong><em>this</em></strong> year&#8217;s questions about <strong><em>last</em></strong> year&#8217;s data.  It could even lead to a striking discovery before we get far into 2012.  <em>[I hope some of the experimenters at ATLAS and CMS are reading this.]</em></p>
<p>Of course we should also get as much information about the Higgs as possible from the new 2012 data, starting in March or April, which with some good fortune might bring 3 to 4 times as many collisions as in 2011. These may occur at a slightly higher energy per collision (8 <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/" target="_blank">TeV</a> versus 7 last year) which would give slightly higher Higgs production rates. If there are some exotic decays happening, we obviously want the LHC experiments to collect as many of them as possible in order to maximize the chances that they can be identified when the data is analyzed. But this is where the trouble starts.</p>
<p>The trigger. Remember the trigger?</p>
<p><a title="The Trigger: Discarding All But the Gold" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/the-trigger-discarding-all-but-the-gold/" target="_blank">Read about the trigger here</a>. You can&#8217;t deeply understand the Large Hadron Collider and how science is done there if you don&#8217;t understand the trigger. It all starts from there.</p>
<p>The trigger involves the real-time trashing of 99.9999% of the data that the LHC is collecting.  As quickly as the data comes in, all but 1 in a million collisions is discarded irretrievably.  There&#8217;s no choice.  Let&#8217;s go through these numbers too.</p>
<p>Last year, 20,000,000 times a second, two bunches of about 100,000,000,000 protons crossed through each other at the center of CMS and at the center of ATLAS; and in each bunch crossing the number of proton-proton collisions which occurred simultaneously was between an average of 5 or so (at the beginning of the year) and an average of 15 (at the end of the year.)</p>
<p>As an aside, note that this means that every time a potentially interesting proton-proton collision occurred at ATLAS or CMS in 2011, the detector was measuring the debris from not just this possibly interesting collision but <strong><em>from as many as 20 others</em></strong> that happened all at the same time. Almost always those other collisions were very boring &#8212; just glancing blows that make small sprays of particles &#8212; but they do clutter up the detector with uninteresting particles that have to be removed later, to the extent possible, in the data analysis stage. These multiple proton-proton collisions in the same bunch crossing are called &#8220;pile-up&#8221;.  <em>[In addition, there are also particles, of rather low energy, still running around from collisions that occurred during previous bunch-crossings, and they&#8217;re actually even worse, I&#8217;m told.]</em>  Pile-up makes measurements harder &#8212; not so much harder that one should avoid pile-up at the expense of fewer collisions, but one has to actively deal with it. <em>The effect of pile-up is a little like electronic static on a video screen (or &#8220;snow&#8221; on an old-style TV) making it harder to see the image; you can still see it, but some of your ability to see detail is lost, and you may want to use special image processing techniques to clean it up.</em></p>
<p>Given this amount of pile-up, the total number of collisions toward the end of 2011 was about <strong>300,000,000</strong> per second, of which it is possible to store <strong>a few hundred</strong> per second, for a total of a few billion (1,000,000,000) collisions stored in 2011 for data analysis. The rest of the half a million billion collisions (570,000,000,000,000) may as well never have happened; they&#8217;re gone, forever.  All of these numbers apply for ATLAS and CMS separately.</p>
<p>This year, the LHC is going to collect more data &#8212; probably not by having more frequent bunch crossings (the only other practical option would be 40,000,000 crossings per second), but probably by arranging for an average of 30 &#8211; 40 proton-proton collisions in each bunch crossing. In other words, <em><strong>the pile-up may double</strong></em>. On top of that, the energy per collision may be slightly higher, meaning the probability of any particular interesting-looking proton-proton collision will be higher. That&#8217;s good because the things you want to discover happen more often; but it&#8217;s still a problem for the trigger, because the rate for interesting-looking-but-actually-boring stuff goes up too&#8230; and since that stuff is so vastly more common, it&#8217;s what determines how aggressive the trigger&#8217;s decisions have to be.</p>
<p>So both the higher energy and the higher pileup will cause new challenges for the trigger. That means that <strong><em>the trigger will have to throw out collisions in 2012 that it would have kept in 2011</em></strong>. (Stated more accurately, the trigger is constantly being adjusted for changing conditions: the more interesting-looking collisions there are, and the more &#8220;noise&#8221; there is from pile-up, the tighter are the criteria that a collision has to satisfy for the trigger system to decide to keep it.)</p>
<p>Now, for some types of searches for new phenomena, this does not matter much. But the Higgs is a lightweight particle, so its decays typically produce a rather small amount of energy and momentum in particles moving perpendicular to the beam. And that isn&#8217;t very distinctive.<em> [Specifically, if you add up the &#8220;scalar transverse momentum&#8221; (take each particle, measure the amount of its momentum perpendicular to the beam &#8212; just the magnitude, not the direction &#8212; and add the numbers up) for all the particles that are produced in a Higgs event, you will get only about 100 &#8212; 200 GeV or so. Unfortunately, a proton-proton collision can in many other ways generate that much transverse momentum &#8212; not easily&#8230; the probability is in the 1/20,000-1/200,000 range&#8230; but that&#8217;s far too often. Remember only 1/1,000,000 events can be stored, and not all of them can be aimed at studying the Higgs &#8212; the LHC needs to look for other new phenomena too, and make precise measurements of known particles, like the top quark.)]</em></p>
<p>What this means is that collisions that make a Higgs particle tend to sit in a dangerous place &#8212; right about where the trigger&#8217;s long knives do their slicing.  So if you don&#8217;t think about the trigger carefully&#8230; ouch!</p>
<p>Even in 2011, the trigger threw quite a few of those 90,000  or so Higgs particles away.  That was ok for Phase 1, the search for the SM Higgs.  The SM Higgs can be <a title="Production of the Standard Model Higgs Particle" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/production-of-the-standard-model-higgs-particle/" target="_blank">produced</a> in several ways, and then can <a title="Decays of the Standard Model Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/decays-of-the-standard-model-higgs/">decay</a> in several ways.  But <a title="Seeking and Studying the Standard Model Higgs Particle" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/seeking-and-studying-the-standard-model-higgs-particle/">not all combinations of production and decay have any hope of being discovered</a>; for some combinations, backgrounds are far too large. Over the years there have been many studies that tell us which combinations are promising, and for each of them, there are logical pathways built into the current trigger strategies at ATLAS and CMS that allow for them to be studied.</p>
<p><strong><em>But what about exotic decays?</em></strong> There are perhaps two dozen possibilities that we have to consider, maybe more. The theoretical studies of how to discover them have in some cases never been performed, and in other cases were performed in a context that is slightly but importantly different from the context of 2012.<em> [One of the most important common differences is that many studies were done to examine what would happen if the Higgs were not found in Phase 1 because the probability of a certain exotic decay is near 100%. In this case the exotic decay would be common, but the Higgs mass would be unknown. But in fact we find ourselves in a different situation, with a Higgs that may be in the process of being found in Phase 1, with a mass that (if it is there) is known to be close to 125 GeV/c<sup>2</sup>, and for which any exotic decay (given that the decays expected in the SM must be common, to make the discovery of this SM-like Higgs possible) must be rare &#8212; at most, say, 10-15% of all Higgs decays, and perhaps much, much smaller! Knowing the Higgs&#8217; mass makes the search <strong>easier</strong>, but the smaller maximum probability for the decay makes it <strong>harder</strong>; together they certainly make the search <strong>different</strong>, different enough that the previous studies may not apply.]</em>  So we find ourselves in the unfortunate position of not yet knowing precisely how to look for large classes of exotic decays.</p>
<p>But we certainly want to know this information in advance! Otherwise, how can we be sure how best to adjust the trigger strategies? How can we try to collect the right fraction of the data starting in March 2012, if we don&#8217;t know what strategies we&#8217;re going to want to use at the time of the data analyses, some of which won&#8217;t be done until 2013?!</p>
<p>I personally believe that we need to act quickly &#8212; that a number of theory studies of how to detect exotic Higgs decays are needed, <strong><em>now</em></strong>. [I hope some of my theorist colleagues are reading this.]</p>
<p>Certain things have to be done faster than others. The most urgent <em>(which is what I have been working on for the past month, in consultation with some members of CMS and separately with some members of ATLAS &#8212; the two detectors have trigger systems which are different in crucial ways, and the strategies they will use may end up being quite different)</em> is to understand which types of exotic decays are most likely to cause a problem for the trigger systems, such that collisions that make a Higgs with this type of decay would often be discarded under present trigger strategies. Conversely, for these problematic cases, it is urgent to understand what types of tricks can be used to make sure that more of these collisions pass the trigger. The good news is that the number of dangerous cases isn&#8217;t quite as large as I initially feared, and in the cases that worry me, it appears tentatively that there might be some tricks that can be played. But the jury is still out.</p>
<p>Moreover, adjusting the trigger is very complicated and controversial, because any time you choose to play some tricks that allow the trigger to keep a class of events that you were going to throw away, you have to choose to throw away <em>other</em> events that you were planning to keep. It&#8217;s close to a zero-sum game. So this is not something to be done lightly; you have to find the right compromise, and long arguments ensue within the experimental collaborations as to how best to do that.</p>
<p>Fortunately, even if in 2012 ATLAS and CMS don&#8217;t trigger on Higgs exotic decays as well as they possibly could, there is a safety net, a fall-back position. As various people often remind me, the production of a Higgs from a collision of a quark and anti-quark that makes a Higgs along with a W or Z particle (<a title="Production of the Standard Model Higgs Particle" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/production-of-the-standard-model-higgs-particle/">see the third row of Figure 2 of my article on Higgs production</a>) offers a guarantee: no matter how the <strong><em>Higgs</em></strong> decays, the ~22% of the time that the <strong>W</strong> decays to a lepton and a neutrino, and the ~25% of the time that the <strong>Z</strong> decays to a neutrino/anti-neutrino or to a lepton/anti-lepton pair, offer up something that the trigger system can easily recognize &#8212; a lepton and/or anti-lepton, or &#8220;missing energy&#8221;<em> (actually &#8220;missing transverse momentum&#8221;, or, more intuitively, a sign that something you can detect must be recoiling against something you have failed to detect &#8212; the neutrinos in this case.)</em> But unfortunately the production of a Higgs in association with a W or Z is only about 5% of Higgs production (for an SM Higgs of 125 GeV; it&#8217;s a bit less for a heavier one and a bit more for a lighter one.) So if we have to rely on the safety net, only about 1% (and probably somewhat less when all is said and done) of Higgs bosons produced at the LHC will be triggered in this way. That means that although we&#8217;d have something like 400,000 Higgs bosons produced at each experiment in 2012, and perhaps as many as 40,000 or so decaying exotically, we&#8217;d only have 400 exotic decays stored permanently for later data analysis. Clearly, anything we can do to increase that 400 toward 4000  is worth doing!  Especially since the fraction of exotic decays might be much smaller than 10%, making that 400 in the safety net more like 40 or 4.  So yes, there&#8217;s a fall-back position, but we shouldn&#8217;t fall back until we&#8217;re beaten. And my own studies suggest we&#8217;re nowhere near beaten yet &#8212; though the time constraints of getting ready for the start of the 2012 data-taking mean we do have to work very fast.</p>
