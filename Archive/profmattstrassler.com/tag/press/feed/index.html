										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why did so few people see auroras on Friday night, after all the media hype? You can see one of two reasons in the data. <a title="Auroras — Quantum Physics in the Sky — Tonight?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/09/12/auroras-quantum-physics-in-the-sky-tonight/" target="_blank">As I explained in my last post</a>, you can read what happened in the data shown in the Satellite Environment Plot from <a href="http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/" target="_blank">this website</a> <em>(warning &#8212; they&#8217;re going to make new version of the website soon, so you might have to modify this info a bit.)</em> Here&#8217;s what the plot looked like Sunday morning.</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_7758" style="width: 489px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/satenvsept14.gif"><img loading="lazy" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-7758" data-attachment-id="7758" data-permalink="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/09/15/why-did-so-few-people-see-auroras-on-friday-night/satenvsept14/" data-orig-file="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/satenvsept14.gif" data-orig-size="640,480" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="SatEnvSept14" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="&lt;p&gt;What the &#8220;Satellite Environment Plot&#8221; on swpc.noaa.gov looked like on Sunday.  Friday is at left; time shown is &#8220;Universal&#8221; time; New York time is 4 hours later. There were two storms, shown as the red bars in the Kp index plot; one occurred very early Friday morning and one later on Friday.  You can see the start of the second storm in the &#8220;GOES Hp&#8221; plot, where the magnetic field goes wild very suddenly.

Friday is at left.  Time shown is &#8220;Universal&#8221; time (UTC); New York time is 4 hours later at this time of year. There were two storms, shown as the red bars in the Kp index chart (fourth line); one occurred very early Friday morning and one later on Friday. You can see the start of the second storm in the &#8220;GOES Hp&#8221; chart (third line), where the magnetic field goes wild very suddenly. The storm was subsiding by midnight Universal time, so it was mostly over by midnight New York time.</p></div>
<p>What the figure shows is that after a first geomagnetic storm very early Friday, a strong geomagnetic storm started (as shown by the sharp jump in the GOES Hp chart) later on Friday, a little after noon New York time [&#8220;UTC&#8221; is currently New York + 4/5 hours], and that it was short &#8212; mostly over before midnight. Those of you out west never had a chance; it was all over before the sun set. Only people in far western Europe had good timing. Whatever the media was saying about later Friday night and Saturday night was somewhere between uninformed and out of date.  Your best bet was to be looking at this chart, which would have shown you that (despite predictions, which for auroras are always quite uncertain) there was nothing going on after Friday midnight New York time.</p>
<p>But the second reason is something that the figure doesn&#8217;t show. Even though this was a strong geomagnetic storm (the Kp index reached 7, the strongest in quite some time), the auroras didn&#8217;t migrate particularly far south. They were seen in the northern skies of Maine, Vermont and New Hampshire, but not (as far as I know) in Massachusetts. Certainly I didn&#8217;t see them. That just goes to show you <em>(AccuWeather, and other media, are you listening?)</em> that predicting the precise timing and extent of auroras is educated guesswork, and will remain so until current knowledge, methods and information are enhanced. One simply can&#8217;t know for sure how far south the auroras will extend, even if the impact on the geomagnetic field is strong.</p>
<p>For those who did see the auroras on Friday night, <a href="http://spaceweathergallery.com/indiv_upload.php?upload_id=101829&amp;PHPSESSID=gqkuvfv22at9icg8c240bjun15" target="_blank">it was quite a sight</a>. And for the rest of us who didn&#8217;t see them this time, there&#8217;s no reason for us to give up. Solar maximum is not over, and even though this is a rather weak sunspot cycle, the chances for more auroras over the next year or so are still pretty good.</p>
<p>Finally, a lesson for those who went out and stared at the sky for hours after the storm was long over &#8212; get your scientific information <a href="http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/" target="_blank">from the source</a>!  There&#8217;s no need, in the modern world, to rely on out-of-date media reports.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maybe. If we collectively, and you personally, are lucky, then maybe you might see auroras &#8212; quantum physics in the sky &#8212; tonight.</p>
<p>Before I tell you about the science, I&#8217;m going to tell you where to get accurate information, and where <strong>not</strong> to get it; and then I&#8217;m going to give you a rough idea of what auroras are. It will be rough because it&#8217;s complicated and it would take more time than I have today, and it also will be rough because auroras are still only partly understood.</p>
<p><strong>Bad Information</strong></p>
<p>First though &#8212; as usual, <strong>do NOT get your information from the mainstream media</strong>, or even the media that ought to be scientifically literate but isn&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve seen a ton of misinformation already about timing, location, and where to look. For instance, here&#8217;s a map from AccuWeather, telling you who is likely to be able to see the auroras.</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_7748" style="width: 358px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/accuwxaurora.jpg"><img loading="lazy" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-7748" data-attachment-id="7748" data-permalink="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/09/12/auroras-quantum-physics-in-the-sky-tonight/accuwxaurora/" data-orig-file="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/accuwxaurora.jpg" data-orig-size="650,366" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="AccuWxAurora" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="&lt;p&gt;Don&#8217;t believe this map by AccuWeather.  Oh, sure, they know something about clouds.  But auroras, not much.  &lt;/p&gt;
" data-medium-file="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/accuwxaurora.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/accuwxaurora.jpg?w=500" class=" wp-image-7748" src="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/accuwxaurora.jpg?w=348&#038;h=204" alt="Don't believe this map by AccuWeather.  Oh, sure, they know something about clouds.  But auroras, not much.  " width="348" height="204" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-7748" class="wp-caption-text">Don&#8217;t believe this map by AccuWeather. Oh, sure, they know something about clouds. But auroras, not much.</p></div>
<p>See that line below which it says &#8220;not visible&#8221;? This implies that there&#8217;s a nice sharp geographical line between those who <em>can&#8217;t possibly</em> see it and those who <em>will definitely</em> see it if the sky is clear. Nothing could be further than the truth. No one knows where that line will lie tonight, and besides, it won&#8217;t be a nice smooth curve. There could be auroras visible in New Mexico, and none in Maine&#8230; not because it&#8217;s cloudy, but because the start time of the aurora can&#8217;t be predicted, and because its strength and location will change over time. If you&#8217;re north of that line, you may see nothing, and if you&#8217;re south of it you still might see something.  (Accuweather also says that you&#8217;ll see it first in the northeast and then in the midwest.  Not necessarily.  It may become visible across the U.S. all at the same time.  Or it may be seen out west but not in the east, or vice versa.)</p>
<p>Auroras aren&#8217;t like solar or lunar eclipses, absolutely predictable as to when they&#8217;ll happen and who can see them. They aren&#8217;t even like comets, which behave unpredictably but at least have predictable orbits. (Remember <a title="Icy Comet ISON’s Trial By Fire" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/11/28/icy-comet-isons-trial-by-fire/">Comet ISON</a>? It arrived exactly when expected, but evaporated and disintegrated under the Sun&#8217;s intense stare.) Auroras are more like weather &#8212; and predictions of auroras are more like predictions of rain, only in some ways worse. An aurora is a dynamic, ever-changing phenomenon, and to predict where and when it can be seen is not much more than educated guesswork. No prediction of an aurora sighting is <strong>EVER</strong> a guarantee. Nor is the absence of an aurora prediction a guarantee one can&#8217;t be seen; occasionally they appear unexpectedly.  That said, the best chance of seeing one further away from the poles than usual is a couple of days after a major solar flare &#8212; and we had one a couple of days ago.</p>
<p><strong>Good Information and How to Use it</strong></p>
<p>If you want accurate information about auroras, you want to get it from the <a href="http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/" target="_blank">Space Weather Prediction Center, click here for their main webpage.</a> Look at the colorful graph on the lower left of that webpage, the &#8220;Satellite Environment Plot&#8221;. Here&#8217;s an example of that plot taken from earlier today:</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_7749" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/satenvsept142014.gif"><img loading="lazy" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-7749" data-attachment-id="7749" data-permalink="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/09/12/auroras-quantum-physics-in-the-sky-tonight/satenvsept142014/" data-orig-file="https://profmattstrassler.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/satenvsept142014.gif" data-orig-size="640,480" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="SatEnvSept142014" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;Satellite Environment Plot&#8221; from earlier today; focus your attention on the two lower charts, the one with the red and blue wiggly lines (GOES Hp) and on the one with the bars (Kp Index).  How to use them is explained in the text.&lt;/p&gt;

How to use them is explained in the text.</p></div>
<p>There&#8217;s a LOT of data on that plot, but for lack of time let me cut to the chase. The most important information is on the bottom two charts.<span id="more-7747"></span></p>
<p>The bottom row, the &#8220;Estimated Kp index&#8221;, tells you, roughly, how much &#8220;geomagnetic activity&#8221; there is (i.e., how disturbed is the earth&#8217;s magnetic field). If the most recent bars are red, then the activity index is 5 or above, and there&#8217;s a decent chance of auroras. The higher the index, the more likely are auroras and the further away from the earth&#8217;s poles they will be seen. That is, if you live in the northern hemisphere, the larger is the Kp index, the further south the auroras are likely to be visible. [If it&#8217;s more than 5, you&#8217;ve got a good shot well down into the bulk of the United States.]</p>
<p>The only problem with the Kp index is that it is a 3-hour average, so it may not go red until the auroras have already been going for a couple of hours! So that&#8217;s why the row above it, &#8220;GOES Hp&#8221;, is important and helpful. This plot gives you much more up-to-date information about what the magnetic field of the earth is up to. Notice, in the plot above, that the magnetic field goes crazy (i.e. the lines get all wiggly) just around the time that the Kp index starts to be yellow or starts to be red.</p>
<p>Therefore, <em><strong>keep an eye on the GOES Hp chart</strong></em>. If you see it start to go crazy sometime in the next 48 hours, that&#8217;s a strong indication that the blast of electrically-charged particles from the Sun, thrown out in that recent solar flare, has arrived at the Earth, and auroras are potentially imminent.  It won&#8217;t tell you how strong they are though.  Still, this is your signal, if skies near you are dark and sufficiently clear, to go out and look for auroras. If you don&#8217;t see them, try again later; they&#8217;re changeable. If you don&#8217;t see them over the coming hour or so, keep an eye on the Kp index chart. If you&#8217;re in the mid-to-northern part of the U.S. and you see that index jump higher than 5, there&#8217;s a significant geomagnetic storm going on, so keep trying. And if you see it reach 8 or so, definitely try even if you&#8217;re living quite far south.</p>
<p>Of course, don&#8217;t forget Twitter and other real-time feeds.  These can tell you whether and where people are seeing auroras. Keeping an eye on Twitter and hashtags like #aurora, #auroras, #northernlights is probably a good idea.</p>
<p>One more thing before getting into the science. We call these things the &#8220;northern lights&#8221; in the northern hemisphere, but clearly, since they can be seen in different places, they&#8217;re not always or necessarily north of any particular place. Looking north is a good idea &#8212; most of us who can see these things tonight or tomorrow night will probably be south of them &#8212; but the <em><strong>auroras can be overhead or even south of you</strong></em>. So don&#8217;t immediately give up if your northern sky is blocked by clouds or trees. Look around the sky.</p>
<p><strong>Auroras: Quantum Physics in the Sky</strong></p>
<p>Now, what are you seeing if you are lucky enough to see an aurora? Most likely what you&#8217;ll see is green, though red, blue and purple are common (and sometimes combinations which give other colors, but these are the basic ones.)  Why?</p>
<p>The typical sequence of events preceding a bright aurora is this:</p>
<ol>
<li>A sunspot &#8212; an area of intense magnetic activity on the Sun, where the sun&#8217;s apparent surface looks dark &#8212; becomes unstable and suffers an explosion of sorts, a solar flare.</li>
<li>Associated with the solar flare may be a &#8220;coronal mass ejection&#8221; &#8212; the expulsion of huge numbers of charged (and neutral) particles out into space. These charged particles include both <a title="Electrons: On the Outskirts of Atoms" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/electrons-on-the-outskirts-of-atoms/" target="_blank">electrons</a> and <a title="Atoms: Their Inner Workings" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/atoms-building-blocks-of-molecules/atoms-their-inner-workings/" target="_blank">ions</a> (i.e. atoms which have lost one or more electrons). <em>(Coronal mass ejections, which are not well understood, can occur in other ways, but the strongest are from big flares.)</em></li>
<li>These charged particles travel at high speeds (much faster than any current human spaceship, but much slower than the speed of light) across space. If the sunspot that flared happens to be facing Earth, then some of those particles will arrive at Earth after as little as a day and as much as three days. Powerful flares typically make faster particles which therefore arrive sooner.</li>
<li>When these charged particles arrive near Earth, it may happen (depending on what the Sun&#8217;s magnetic field and the Earth&#8217;s magnetic field and the magnetic fields near the particles are all doing) that many of the particles may spiral down the Earth&#8217;s magnetic field, which draws them to the Earth&#8217;s north and south magnetic poles (which lie close to the Earth&#8217;s north and south geographic poles.)</li>
<li>When these high-energy particles (electrons and ions) rain down onto the Earth, they typically will hit atoms in the Earth&#8217;s upper atmosphere, 40 to 200 miles up. The ensuing collisions kick <a title="Atoms: Their Inner Workings" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/atoms-building-blocks-of-molecules/atoms-their-inner-workings/" target="_blank">electrons in the struck atoms into &#8220;orbits&#8221; that they don&#8217;t normally occupy</a>, as though they were suddenly moved from an inner superhighway ring road around a city to an outer ring road highway. We call these outer orbits &#8220;excited orbits&#8221;, and an atom of this type an &#8220;excited atom&#8221;.</li>
<li>Eventually the electrons fall from these &#8220;excited orbits&#8221; back down to their usual orbits. This is often referred to as a &#8220;quantum transition&#8221; or, colloquially, a &#8220;quantum jump&#8221;, as the electron is never really found between the starting outer orbit and the final inner one; it almost instantaneously transfers from one to the other.</li>
<li>In doing so, the jumping electron will emit a particle of <em>electromagnetic radiation</em>, called a &#8220;<em>photon</em>&#8221;. The energy of that photon, thanks to the wonderful properties of quantum mechanics, <em><strong>is always the same</strong></em> for any particular quantum transition.</li>
<li>Visible light is a form of electromagnetic radiation, and photons of visible light are, by definition, ones that our eyes can see. The reason we can see auroras is that for particular quantum transitions of oxygen and nitrogen, the photons emitted are indeed those of visible light. Moreover, <strong><em>because the energy for each photon from a given transition is always the same, the color of the light that our eyes see, for that particular transition, is always the same</em></strong>. There is a transition in oxygen that always gives green light; that&#8217;s why auroras are often green. There is a more fragile transition that always gives red light; powerful auroras, which can excite oxygen atoms even higher in the atmosphere, where they are more diffuse and less likely to hit something before they emit light, can give red auroras. Similarly, nitrogen molecules have a transition that can give blue light. <em>(Other transitions give light that our eyes can&#8217;t see.)</em>  Combinations of these can give yellows, pinks, purples, whites, etc. But the basic colors are typically green and red, occasionally blue, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>So if you are lucky enough to see an aurora tonight or tomorrow night, consider what you are seeing.  Huge energies involving magnetic fields on the Sun have blown particles &#8212; the same particles that are of particular significance to this website &#8212; into space.  Particle physics and atomic physics at the top of the atmosphere lead to the emission of light many miles above the Earth.  And the remarkable surprises of quantum mechanics make that light not a bland grey, with all possible colors blended crudely together, but instead a magical display of specific and gorgeous hues, reminding us that the world is far more subtle than our daily lives would lead us to believe.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No.</p>
<p>The Higgs boson is not dangerous and will not destroy the universe.</p>
<p>The Higgs boson is a type of <em>particle</em>, a little ripple in the Higgs <em>field</em>. <em>[See <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">here for the Higgs FAQ</a>.]</em> This lowly particle, if you&#8217;re lucky enough to make one (and at the world&#8217;s largest particle accelerator, the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a>, only one in a trillion proton-proton collisions actually does so) has a brief life, <a title="Most Particles Decay — But Why?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/why-do-particles-decay/most-particles-decay-why/" target="_blank">disintegrating to other particles</a> in less than the time that it takes light to cross from one side of an atom to another. (Recall that light can travel from the Earth to the Moon in under two seconds.) Such a fragile creature is hardly more dangerous than a <a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/189544/mayfly" target="_blank">mayfly</a>.</p>
<p>Anyone who says otherwise probably read Hawking&#8217;s book (or read about it in the press) but didn&#8217;t understand what he or she was reading, perhaps because he or she had not read <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">the Higgs FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to worry about something Higgs-related, you can <em>try</em> to worry about the Higgs field, which is &#8220;ON&#8221; in our universe, though not nearly as &#8220;on&#8221; as it could be. If someone were to turn the Higgs field OFF, let&#8217;s say as a practical joke, that would be a disaster: all ordinary matter across the universe would explode, because the <a title="Electrons: On the Outskirts of Atoms" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/electrons-on-the-outskirts-of-atoms/" target="_blank">electrons on the outskirts of atoms</a> would <a title="Why the Higgs Particle Matters" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/why-the-higgs-particle-matters/" target="_blank">lose their mass and fly off into space</a>. This is not something to worry about, however. We know it would require an input of energy and can&#8217;t happen spontaneously.  Moreover, the amount of energy required to artificially turn the Higgs field off is immense; to do so even in a small room would require energy comparable to that of a typical supernova, an explosion of a star that can outshine an entire galaxy and releases the vast majority of its energy in unseen neutrinos. No one, fortunately, has a supernova in his or her back pocket. And if someone did, we&#8217;d have more immediate problems than worrying about someone wasting a supernova trying to turn off the Higgs field in a basement somewhere.</p>
<p>Now it would also be a disaster if someone could turn the Higgs field WAY UP&#8230; more than when your older brother turned up the volume on your stereo or MP3 player and blew out your speakers. In this case atoms would violently collapse, or worse, and things would be just as nasty as if the Higgs field were turned OFF. Should you worry about this? Well, it&#8217;s possible this could happen spontaneously, so it&#8217;s slightly more plausible. But I do mean slightly. <strong><em>Very</em></strong> slightly.<span id="more-7739"></span></p>
<p>Recently, physicists have been writing about this possibility because if (a) you <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>ASSUME</strong></span> that the types of particles that we&#8217;ve discovered so far are the <em>only</em> ones that affect the Higgs field, and (b) you <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">ASSUME</span></strong> that there are no other important forces that affect the Higgs field other than the ones we know, then you can calculate, with <em>some</em> degree of reliability (though there is a debate about that degree) that (1) the Higgs field could lower the energy of the universe by suddenly jumping from ON to WAY WAY SUPER-DUPER ON, and (2) that the time we&#8217;d have to wait for it to do so spontaneously isn&#8217;t infinite.  It would do this in two steps: first a bubble of WAY WAY ON Higgs field would form <em>(via the curious ability of quantum mechanics to make the improbable happen, rarely)</em>, and then that bubble would expand and sweep across the universe, destroying everything in its path.</p>
<p><em>An aside: In particle physics <a title="Modern Physics: Increasingly Vacuous" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/05/08/modern-physics-increasingly-vacuous/">lingo explained here</a>, we say that &#8220;the universe has two possible &#8216;vacua&#8217;, the vacuum we live in, in which the Higgs field is ON a bit, and a second vacuum in which the Higgs field is HUGELY ON.&#8221; If the second vacuum has lower energy than the first, then the first vacuum is said to be &#8220;metastable&#8221;: although it lasts a very long time, it has a very small but non-zero probability of turning into the second vacuum someday.  That&#8217;s because a bubble of the second vacuum that appears by chance inside the first vacuum will expand, and take over the whole universe.</em></p>
<p>Ok. First, should you buy the original assumptions? No. It&#8217;s just humans assuming that what we currently know is all there is to know; since when has that been true?  Second, even if you do buy them, should you worry about the conclusion? No. The universe has existed in its current form for about 13.7 billion years. The Higgs field may not perform this nasty jump for trillions of years, or trillions of trillions, or trillions of trillions of trillions, or more. Likely more. In any case, nobody knows, but really, nobody should care very much. The calculation is hard, the answer highly uncertain, and worse, the whole thing is profoundly dependent on the <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">ASSUMPTIONS</span></strong>. In fact, if the assumptions are slightly wrong &#8212; if there are other particles and forces that affect the Higgs field, or if there is more than one Higgs-like field in nature &#8212; then the calculation could end up being way off from the truth. Also possible is that the calculational method, which is subtle, isn&#8217;t yet refined enough to give the right answer.  Altogether, this means that not only might the Higgs field&#8217;s nasty jump be much more or less likely than is currently believed, it might not even be possible at all. So we don&#8217;t actually <em>know</em> anything for sure, despite all the loose talk that suggests that we do.  But in any case, since the universe has lived 13.7 billion years already, the chance is <strong><em>ridiculously tiny</em></strong> that this Higgs field jump, even if it is possible at all, will occur in your ultra-short 100 year-ish lifetime, or even that of any of your descendants.</p>
<p>What about the possibility that human beings could <em>artificially</em> cause the Higgs field to turn WAY WAY ON? Again, the amount of energy involved in trying to do that is extremely large &#8212; not a supernova, now, but far, far beyond current human capability, and likely impossible.  (The technology required to build a particle accelerator with collisions at this energy, and the financial and environmental cost of running it, are more than a little difficult to imagine.)  At this point we can barely make Higgs bosons &#8212; little ripples in the Higgs field; now you want to imagine us making a bubble where the Higgs field is WAY WAY WAY MORE ON than usual? We&#8217;re scientists, not magicians. And we deal in science &#8212; i.e., reality.  Current and foreseeable technology cannot turn this imaginary possibility into reality.</p>
<p>Some dangers actually exist in reality. Asteroidlets do sometimes hit the earth; supernovas do explode, and a nearby one would be terrible; and you should not be wandering outdoors or in a shower during a lightning storm.  As for the possible spontaneous destruction of the universe? Well, if it happens some day, it may have nothing to do with the Higgs field; it may very well be due to <em>some other</em> field, about which we currently know <em>nothing</em>, making a jump of a sort that we haven&#8217;t even learned about yet. Humans tend to assume that the things they know about are much scarier than they actually are (e.g. Yellowstone, the &#8220;super&#8221;-volcano) and that the things they don&#8217;t know about are much less scary than they actually are (e.g. what people used to think about ozone-destroying chemicals before they knew they destroyed ozone.) This is worth keeping in mind.</p>
<p>So anyone who tells you that we <em>know</em> that the universe is only &#8220;meta-stable&#8221;, and that someday the Higgs field will destroy it by suddenly screaming at the top of its lungs, or that we might cause it to do so, is forgetting to tell you about all the assumptions that went into that conclusion, and about the incredible energies required which may far exceed what humans can ever manage, and about the incredible lengths of time that may be involved, by which point there may be no more stars left to keep life going anyway, and possibly not even any more protons to make atoms out of. There&#8217;s a word for this kind of wild talk: &#8220;scare-mongering&#8221;.  You can safely go back to sleep.</p>
<p>Or not. There&#8217;s plenty to keep you awake. But by comparison with the spread of the Ebola virus, the increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and acidification of the oceans, or the accelerating loss of the world&#8217;s biodiversity, not to mention the greed and violence common in our species, worrying about Higgs bosons, or even the Higgs field in which a Higgs particle is a tiny ripple, seems to me a tempest in a top quark.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did the universe begin with a singularity?  A point in space and/or a moment in time where everything in the universe was crushed together, infinitely hot and infinitely densely packed?</p>
<p><strong><em>Doesn&#8217;t the Big Bang Theory say so?</em></strong></p>
<p>Well, let me ask you a question. Did <strong>you</strong> begin with a singularity?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see. Some decades ago, you were smaller. And then before that, you were even smaller. At some point you could fit inside your mother&#8217;s body, and if we follow time backwards, you were even much smaller than that.</p>
<p>If we follow your growth curve back, it would be very natural &#8212; if we didn&#8217;t know anything about biology, cells, and human reproduction &#8212; to assume that initially you were infinitesimally small&#8230; that you were created from a single point!</p>
<p>But that would be wrong. The mistake is obvious &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t make sense to assume that the period of rapid growth that you went through as a tiny embryo was the simple continuation of a process that extends on and on into the past, back until you were infinitely small.  Instead, there was a point where something changed&#8230; the growth began not from a point but from a single object of definite size: a fertilized egg.</p>
<p>The notion that the Universe <em>started</em> with a Big Bang, and that this Big Bang <em>started</em> from a singularity &#8212; a point in space and/or a moment in time where the universe was infinitely hot and dense &#8212; is not that different, really, from assuming humans begin their lives as infinitely small eggs. It&#8217;s about over-extrapolating into the past.<span id="more-7526"></span></p>
<p>The connection with some kind of singularity dates back to the original Big Bang idea, the one which precedes the notion of <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">cosmic inflation</a> that&#8217;s been in the news over the past few days.  <em>[Here&#8217;s <a title="A Primer On Today’s Events" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/a-primer-on-todays-events/" target="_blank">an FAQ</a> for non-experts about the news; <a title="BICEP2: New Evidence Of Cosmic Inflation!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/bicep2-new-evidence-of-cosmic-inflation/" target="_blank">the news</a> itself; and <a title="If It Holds Up, What Might BICEP2′s Discovery Mean?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/18/if-its-holds-up-what-might-bicep2s-discovery-mean/" target="_blank">what the news might mean if it holds up</a>.]</em>  The part of the universe that we can see with our eyes and telescopes is the &#8220;observable patch&#8221; of the universe; it is probably far smaller than the whole universe <em>(or, if it&#8217;s sufficiently complicated, &#8220;the multiverse&#8221;).</em>  What we know from interpreting various observations of the cosmos is that</p>
<ul>
<li>today the observable patch is cold and diffuse and expanding</li>
<li>once upon a time, billions of years ago, the observable patch was hot and dense</li>
</ul>
<p>To the extent that we trust Einstein&#8217;s equations for gravity, we can use those equations to understand how the Universe might have had this present and that past.  People studying those equations (Friedmann, LeMaître, Robertson and Walker) learned that a universe can go through a process of expanding, cooling and diffusing &#8212; and thus could proceed from <span style="color:#ff9900;"><strong>a hot, dense, rapidly expanding past</strong></span> to <span style="color:#000080;">a <strong><span style="color:#00ccff;"><em>cool, diffuse and slowly expanding present</em></span></strong></span>. This process is what we think our observable patch (and probably a larger region in which it is contained) has been doing for almost all of its 13.7 billion year history.</p>
<p>But suppose, seeing this behavior, we use these equations try to follow time <em>backwards</em> &#8212; just as we tried to infer the past of an embryo. We find our equations suggest a universe in which the further you go back, the hotter it was, the more dense, and the more rapidly it was expanding. If you keep going back and back, then <em>(in the Old Big Bang model, before we knew about inflation)</em> you find that at a sufficiently early time, 13.7 billion years ago, the density, temperature and expansion rate start off as <strong>infinite</strong>. That&#8217;s a <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>singularity!</em></span></p>
<p>But would you have a reason to believe in that singularity?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve talked over the years with many experts in &#8220;quantum gravity&#8221; <em>[the poorly understood but required blend of Einstein&#8217;s gravity and quantum physics, a blend that will be needed to explain extreme gravitational phenomena]</em> and I&#8217;ve never spoken to one who  believed that the universe began with a real singularity. Why? Because</p>
<ul>
<li>the singularity arises from using Einstein&#8217;s equations for gravity</li>
<li>but we know Einstein&#8217;s equations aren&#8217;t <em>sufficient</em> &#8212; they aren&#8217;t able to describe certain extreme gravitational phenomena.</li>
</ul>
<p>Specifically, when the density and heat become extremely large, quantum physics of gravity becomes important. <em>But Einstein&#8217;s equations ignore all these quantum effects.</em> So we already know that <strong><em>in certain extreme conditions, Einstein&#8217;s equations simply don&#8217;t apply</em></strong>. How could we then use those very same equations to conclude there&#8217;s a singularity at the beginning of the universe?</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t.</p>
<p>And if we don&#8217;t know how to alter Einstein&#8217;s gravity equations to make them into quantum gravity equations, then &#8212; well, we don&#8217;t know what happens <em>instead</em> of a singularity.</p>
<p>Now that was where things stood before inflation was known. Inflation changes the details of the <a title="History of the Universe" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/" target="_blank">history of the universe</a> quite a lot. But it doesn&#8217;t change the basic conclusion about singularities: we don&#8217;t and can&#8217;t yet know what happened at the earliest moments of the universe, because we have neither data nor sufficiently clear equations to help us answer basic questions about it.  Related to this, we don&#8217;t know precisely how inflation started (or even <em>could</em> have started) in the first place.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not making this up out of my head.  Just yesterday I was involved in a long conversation with professors and post-doctoral researchers at Harvard, in which we discussed various exotic mathematical methods for exploring the inflationary epoch and the era before it. The possibility that there really is a singularity at the beginning of the universe never came up once.</p>
<p>Or you can look at papers by the world&#8217;s experts &#8212; say, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0702178" target="_blank">one by Alan Guth, a 17-page review</a> of &#8220;eternal&#8221; inflation (i.e. inflation that continues, at least somewhere in our very large universe, into the infinite future) &#8212; and although he devotes some pages to the issue of what might have preceded inflation, the word &#8220;singularity&#8221; does not appear anywhere in his text.</p>
<p>Or look at the figure below, taken from page 6 of <a href="http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/lectures/Biermann_07/LindeLecturesMunich1.pdf" target="_blank">a lecture by Andrei Linde in 2007</a>, giving a schematic depiction of the history of the part of the universe that contains our observable patch.   You see that he shows it as beginning not in a singularity but in &#8220;space-time foam&#8221;. <em>[Compare his picture with the one in my <a title="History of the Universe" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/" target="_blank">History of the Universe</a> article.]</em> What&#8217;s space-time foam? It&#8217;s space-time that is undergoing <a title="Quantum Fluctuations and Their Energy" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/quantum-fluctuations-and-their-energy/" target="_blank">quantum fluctuations</a> &#8212; quantum jitter &#8212; in which space itself is changing its shape from moment to moment!  Well, when someone writes &#8220;space-time foam&#8221; on a graph, to physicists it means almost the same as writing &#8220;somehow quantum gravity takes care of everything&#8221;, without specifics.  (I am confident that Linde will agree that the extreme left of his figure is quite speculative.)</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">Yet all over the media and all over the web, we can find articles, including ones published just after <a title="BICEP2: New Evidence Of Cosmic Inflation!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/bicep2-new-evidence-of-cosmic-inflation/" target="_blank">this week&#8217;s cosmic announcement of new evidence in favor of inflation</a>, that state with great confidence that in the Big Bang Theory the universe started from a singularity. So I&#8217;m honestly very confused. <strong>Who</strong> is still telling the media and the public that the universe really started with a singularity, or that the modern Big Bang Theory says that it does? I&#8217;ve never heard an expert physicist say that. And with good reason: when singularities and other infinities have turned up in our equations in the past, those singularities disappeared when our equations, or our understanding of how to use our equations, improved. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">Moreover, there&#8217;s a point of logic here.  How <em>could</em> we possibly know what happened at the very beginning of the universe? No experiment can yet probe such an early time, and none of the available equations are powerful enough or usable enough to allow us to come to clear and unique conclusions.</span></p>
<p>The modern Big Bang Theory really starts <em>after</em> this period of ignorance, <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">with a burst of inflation that creates a large expanding universe, and the end of inflation which allows for the creation of the heat of the Hot Big Bang</a>.  The equations for the theory, as it currently stands, can be used to make predictions <em>even though</em> we don&#8217;t know the precise nature of our universe&#8217;s birth. Yes, a singularity often turns up in our equations when we extend them as far as they can go in the past; but a singularity of this sort is far from likely to be an aspect of nature, and instead should be interpreted as a sign of what we don&#8217;t yet understand.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Media absurdity has reached new levels of darkness with the <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/stephen-hawking-there-are-no-black-holes-9085016.html" target="_blank">announcement</a> that Stephen Hawking has <em>a new theory in which <strong>black holes do not exist after all</strong>.</em></p>
<p>No, he doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p><em>[Note added: click here for <a title="Black Hole Information Paradox: An Introduction" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/black-holes/black-hole-information-paradox-an-introduction/">my new introduction to the black hole information paradox.</a>]</em></p>
<p>First, <em>Hawking does not have a new theory</em>&#8230; at least not one he&#8217;s presented. You can <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.5761v1.pdf">look at his paper here</a> &#8212; two pages (pdf), a short commentary that he gave to experts in August 2013 and wrote up as a little document &#8212; and you can see it has no equations at all. <strong><em>That means it doesn&#8217;t qualify as a theory.</em></strong> &#8220;Theory&#8221;, in physics, means: a set of equations that can be used to make predictions for physical processes in a real or imaginary world. When we talk about Einstein&#8217;s theory of relativity, we&#8217;re talking about equations. Compare just the look and feel of <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.5761v1.pdf" target="_blank">Hawking&#8217;s recent note</a> to <a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/einstein/specrel/www/" target="_blank">Einstein&#8217;s 1905 paper</a> on the theory of special relativity, or to <a href="http://www.itp.uni-hannover.de/~giulini/papers/BlackHoleSeminar/Hawking_CMP_1975.pdf" target="_blank">Hawking&#8217;s most famous 1975 paper</a> on black holes; you can easily see the difference without understanding the content of the papers.</p>
<p>The word &#8220;theory&#8221; does not mean &#8220;speculations&#8221; or &#8220;ideas&#8221;, which is all that is contained in this little article. Maybe that&#8217;s what theory means at a cocktail party, but it&#8217;s not what &#8220;theory&#8221; means in physics.</p>
<p>Second, what Hawking is addressing in this note is the precise level of blackness of a black hole&#8230; in short, whether the name &#8220;black hole&#8221; for the objects we call black holes is really appropriate. <em>But simply the fact that black holes aren&#8217;t quite black isn&#8217;t new</em>. In fact it was Hawking himself who became famous in 1974-1975 for pointing out that in a world with quantum physics, typical black holes <em>cannot be precisely black</em> &#8212; so it&#8217;s not true that nothing ever comes out of a black hole. Black holes must slowly radiate elementary particles, a process we call Hawking radiation.</p>
<p>From day 1, Hawking&#8217;s observation posed puzzles about how conflicting requirements of quantum theory and Einstein&#8217;s gravity would be resolved, with quantum theory demanding that all information that fell into the black hole be neither destroyed nor copied, and Einstein&#8217;s gravity insisting that there is no way that the information of what went into a black hole can ever come out again, even if the black hole evaporates and disappears. The assumption of the community has long been that the 1970s calculation that Hawking did, while largely correct, leaves out a small, subtle effect that resolves the puzzle. The question is: what is the nature of that subtle effect?</p>
<p>No one, including Hawking, has posed a satisfactory answer. And that is why we keep hearing about black holes again and again over the decades, most recently in the context of the &#8220;<a title="A Quantum Gravity and Cosmology Conference" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/12/12/two-days-of-polchinski-puzzles/" target="_blank">firewall paradox</a>&#8221;. In his recent paper, Hawking, like many of his colleagues, is proposing another possible answer, though <em>without</em> demonstrating mathematically that his proposal is correct.</p>
<p>But did Hawking really say &#8220;There are no black holes&#8221;, or didn&#8217;t he??</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Talk about taking things out of context!!!</strong></span> Here&#8217;s what Hawking actually said.</p>
<p>First he suggests that the edge of a black hole &#8212; called its &#8220;event horizon&#8221;, a very subtle concept when you get into the details &#8212; really isn&#8217;t so sharp once quantum effects are considered. Many people have suggested one version or another of this possibility, which would represent a small but critical correction to what Hawking said in the 1970s (and to what people understood about black holes even earlier).</p>
<p>And then Hawking writes&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;The absence of event horizons mean that there are no black holes &#8211; in the sense of regimes from which light can&#8217;t escape to infinity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notice the final clause, which is omitted from the media reports, and is absolutely necessary to make sense of his remark. What he means is that <em>black holes are very, very slightly (though importantly) less black than he said in his 1974 paper</em>&#8230; because the things that fall into the black hole do in some sense eventually come back out as the black hole evaporates. I say &#8220;in some sense&#8221; because they come out thoroughly scrambled; <em>you</em>, for example, if you fell in, would not come back out, even though some of the elementary particles out of which you are made might eventually do so.</p>
<p>And then he says</p>
<p>&#8220;There are however apparent horizons which persist for a period of time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Translation: <em>for an extremely long time, what we call a black hole will behave in just the way we have long thought it does</em>. In particular, there is no change in any of the astrophysics of black holes that astronomers have been studying in recent decades. The only issue is what happens as a black hole begins to evaporate in a serious way, and when you look very, very carefully at the details of the Hawking radiation, which is very difficult to do.</p>
<p>&#8220;This suggests that black holes should be redefined as metastable bound states of the gravitational field.&#8221;</p>
<p>In short: In Hawking&#8217;s proposal, it&#8217;s not that the objects that you and I would call &#8220;black holes&#8221; don&#8217;t exist!  They are still there, <em>just with a new name</em>, doing what we&#8217;ve been taught they do except in some fine-grained detail. Not that this fine-grained detail is unimportant &#8212; it&#8217;s essential to resolving the quantum vs. gravity puzzle.  But an ordinary person watching or exploring near a black hole would notice no difference.</p>
<p><em>Notice also all of this is a proposal, made in words; he has not shown this with mathematics.</em></p>
<p>In short, although Hawking is, with many of his colleagues, working hard to resolve the puzzles that seem to make quantum theory conflict with Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity in this context, he&#8217;s not questioning whether black holes exist <em>in the sense that you and I would mean it</em>. He&#8217;s addressing the technical issue of exactly how black they are, and how the information contained in the things that fall in comes back out again. And since he&#8217;s just got words, but not math, to back up his suggestions, he&#8217;s not convinced his colleagues.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the media takes the five words &#8220;There Are No Black Holes&#8221; and creates almost pure fiction, fiction that has almost nothing to do with the reality of the science. Well done, media, well done. Sometimes you&#8217;re just like a black hole: information comes in, and after being completely scrambled beyond recognition, comes back out again through a mysterious process that makes no sense to anyone. Except that in your case, it&#8217;s very clear that information is lost, and misinformation is created.</p>
<p><em><strong>Hey!</strong> That&#8217;s a new theory of black holes! (I&#8217;ll write a 2-page paper on that this afternoon&#8230;)</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>[Note: If you missed Wednesday evening&#8217;s discussion of particle physics involving me, Sean Carroll and Alan Boyle, you can <a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/virtually-speaking-science/2013/12/05/alan-boyle-matt-strassler-sean-carroll-why-the-higgs-particle-matters" target="_blank">listen to it here</a>.]</em></p>
<p>I still have a lot of work to do before I can myself write intelligently about the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, and the nuclear accident and cleanup that occurred there. (See <a title="The Mess at Fukushima, and The Need for a Scientific Lens" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/11/18/the-mess-at-fukushima-and-the-need-for-a-scientific-lens/">here</a> and <a title="A Couple of Questions for Readers" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/11/25/a-couple-of-questions-for-readers/">here</a> for a couple of previous posts about it.) But I did want to draw your attention to <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/dec/03/fukushima-daiichi-tsunami-nuclear-cleanup-japan" target="_blank">one of the better newspaper articles that I&#8217;ve seen written about it, by Ian Sample at the Guardian</a>. I can&#8217;t vouch for everything that Sample says, but given what I&#8217;ve read and investigated myself, I think he finds the right balance. He&#8217;s neither scaring people unnecessarily, nor reassuring them that everything will surely be just fine and that there&#8217;s no reason to be worried about anything. From what I know and understand, the situation is more or less just as serious and worthy of concern as Sample says it is; but conversely, I don&#8217;t have any reason to think it is much <em>worse</em> than what he describes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, just as I don&#8217;t particularly trust anything said by TEPCO, the apparently incompetent and corrupt Japanese power company that runs and is trying to clean up the Fukushima plant, I&#8217;m also continuing to see lots of scary articles &#8212; totally irresponsible &#8212; written by people who should know better but seem bent upon frightening the public. The more wild the misstatements and misleading statements, the better, it seems.</p>
<p>One example of this kind of fear-mongering is to be found here: <a href="http://truth-out.org/news/item/19547-fukushima-a-global-threat-that-requires-a-global-responseBy">http://truth-out.org/news/item/19547-fukushima-a-global-threat-that-requires-a-global-response</a>, by Kevin Zeese and Margaret Flowers. It&#8217;s one piece of junk after the next: the strategy is to take a fact, take another unrelated fact, quote a non-expert (or quote an expert out of context), stick them all together, and wow! frightening!! But here&#8217;s the thing: <strong>An experienced and attentive reader will know, after a few paragraphs, to ignore this article</strong>. Why?</p>
<p><span style="color:#800080;">Because it never puts anything in context.</span> &#8220;When contact with radioactive cesium occurs, which is highly unlikely, a person can experience cell damage due to radiation of the cesium particles. Due to this, effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and bleeding may occur. When the exposure lasts a long time, people may even lose consciousness. Coma or even death may then follow. How serious the effects are depends upon the resistance of individual persons and the duration of exposure and the concentration a person is exposed to, experts say.&#8221; Well, how much cesium are we talking about here? Lots or a little? Ah, they don&#8217;t tell you that. <em>[The answer: enormous amounts. There&#8217;s no chance of you getting anywhere near that amount of exposure unless you yourself go wandering around on the Fukushima grounds, and go some place you&#8217;re really not supposed to go. This didn&#8217;t even happened to the workers who were at the Fukushima plant when everything was at its worst in March 2011. Even if you ate a fish every week from just off Japan that had a small amount of cesium in it, this would not happen to you.]</em></p>
<p><span style="color:#800080;">Because it makes illogical statements.</span> &#8220;Since the accident at Fukushima on March 11, 2011, three reactor cores have gone missing.&#8221; Really? Gone missing? Does that make sense? Well then, why is so much radioactive cooling water &#8212; which is mentioned later in the article &#8212; being stored up at the Fukushima site? Isn&#8217;t that water being used to keep those cores cool? And how could that happen if the cores were missing? <em>[The cores melted; it&#8217;s not known precisely what shape they are in or precisely how much of each is inside or outside the original containment vessel, but they&#8217;re being successfully cooled by water, so it&#8217;s clear roughly where they are. They&#8217;re not &#8220;missing&#8221;; that&#8217;s a wild over-statement.]</em></p>
<p><span style="color:#800080;">Because the authors quote people without being careful to explain clearly who they are.</span> &#8220;Harvey Wasserman, who has been working on nuclear energy issues for over 40 years,&#8230;&#8221; Is Harvey Wasserman a scientist or engineer? No.  But he gets lots of press in this article (and elsewhere.) <em>[Wikipedia says: &#8220;<b>Harvey Franklin Wasserman</b> (born December 31, 1945) is an American journalist, author, democracy activist, and advocate for <a title="Renewable energy" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy">renewable energy</a>. He has been a strategist and organizer in the <a title="Anti-nuclear movement in the United States" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-nuclear_movement_in_the_United_States">anti-nuclear movement in the United States</a> for over 30 years.&#8221; I have nothing against Mr. Wasserman and I personally support both renewable energy and the elimination of nuclear power. But as far as I know, Wasserman has no scientific training, and is not an expert on cleaning up a nuclear plant and the risks thereof&#8230; and he&#8217;s an anti-nuclear <strong>activist</strong>, so you do have to worry he&#8217;s going to make thing sound worse than they are. Always look up the people being quoted!]</em></p>
<p><span style="color:#800080;">Because the article never once provides balance or nuance: absolutely everything is awful, awful, awful.</span> I&#8217;m sorry, but things are never that black and white, or rather, black and black. There are shades of gray in the real world, and it&#8217;s important to tease them out a little bit. There are eventualities that would be really terrible, others that would be unfortunate, still others that would merely be a little disruptive in the local area &#8212; and they&#8217;re not equally bad, nor are they equally likely. <em>[I don&#8217;t get any sense that the authors are trying to help their readers understand; they&#8217;re just bashing the reader over the head with one terrifying-sounding thing after another. This kind of article just isn&#8217;t credible.]</em></p>
<p>The lesson: one has to be a critical, careful reader, and read between the lines! In contrast to Sample&#8217;s article in the Guardian, the document by Zeese and Flowers is not intended to inform; it is intended to frighten, period. I urge you to avoid getting your information from sources like that one. Find reliable, sensible people &#8212; Ian Sample is in that category, I think &#8212; and stick with them. And I would ignore anything Zeese and Flowers have to say in the future; people who&#8217;d write an article like theirs have no credibility.</p>

<p> On Tuesday, the New York Times Editorial page ran an Op-Ed about dark matter&#8230; and although it could have been worse, it could certainly have been better. &nbsp;I do wonder why these folks don&#8217;t just call up an expert and confirm that they&#8217;ve actually got it right, before they mislead the public and give scientists a combination of a few giggles and a headache.</p>
<p>Here is the last paragraph from the Times:</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="color:#339966;">This experiment is probing a major hole in the way we understand the cosmos. Roughly speaking, the force of gravity in the universe can be explained only by a corresponding amount of mass, or matter. Some undiscovered mass — dark matter — must exist in order to explain gravity, but no one has seen any traces of it. Those traces, when they are finally found, will be exotic particles left over from the Big Bang. In the tale we tell about everything we know, scientists have now brought us to the edge of the deep, dark woods. They, and we, are waiting eagerly to see how the rest of the story goes.</span>&#8221;</p>
<p>Ok, out comes the professorial red pen.</p>
<p>First, a relatively minor point of order. &#8220;<span style="color:#339966;">&#8230;the force of gravity in the universe can be explained only by a corresponding amount of mass, or matter&#8230;</span>&#8221; This isn&#8217;t great writing, because mass and matter are not the same thing. Matter is a <em><strong>type</strong></em> of substance. Mass is a <strong><em>property</em></strong> that substance (including ordinary matter, such as tables and planets) can have. Mass and matter are as different as apples and applets. You can read about these distinctions <a title="Mass, Energy, Matter,&nbsp;Etc." href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/" target="_blank">here</a>, if you like. The author is trying to evade this distinction to keep things simple: the more correct statement is that gravity (in simple circumstances) is a force exerted by things (including ordinary matter) that have mass.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s the real offending remark: &#8220;<span style="color:#339966;">Some undiscovered mass — dark matter — must exist in order to explain gravity, but no one has seen any traces of it.</span>&#8221; Dark matter is most certainly <strong>not</strong> needed to &#8220;explain gravity&#8221; in some general way; there&#8217;s not one bit of truth in that remark. For instance, the gravitational pull of the sun on the earth (and vice versa), and the pull of the earth on you and me (and vice versa), has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with dark matter, nor is dark matter needed to explain it.</p>
<p>What the author should have said is: since the 1960s we have known that gravitational forces on large astronomical scales seem to be stronger than we can account for, and so either our equations for gravity are wrong or there is matter out there, pulling on things gravitationally, that we cannot see with any type of telescope. &nbsp;The reason the latter possibility is taken more seriously than the former by most experts is that attempts to modify gravity have not led to a convincing case, while the evidence for additional &#8220;dark&#8221; matter has grown very strong over recent decades.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s one of the several arguments that suggest the possibility of dark matter&#8230; the simplest to explain. Experts study the motions of the stars in our own galaxy &#8212; the star city known as the Milky Way &#8212; and also study the motions of stars in other <a href="http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120518.html" target="_blank">galaxies</a>. [The overall motions of galaxies themselves, inside <a href="http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2003/01" target="_blank">giant clusters of galaxies</a> which can be found in deep space, are also studied.] Now what we ask is this; see Figure 1. Supposing all of the matter that is out there in the universe is of a type that we can see in one way or another: stars, gas, dust of various types. Then we can figure out, just by looking with a telescope and doing simple calculations, roughly how much measurable matter is in each galaxy, how much mass that matter has, and where it is distributed inside the galaxy. &nbsp;We can next use that information to figure out how hard that matter pulls on other matter, via the force of gravity. And finally &#8212; crucially! &#8212; we can calculate how fast that pull will make the matter move, on average. &nbsp;And what do we find when we measure how fast the stars are moving? Our calculations based on the matter that we can see are <strong>wrong</strong>. We find that the stars in the outer edges of a galaxy, and the galaxies inside clusters, are moving much, much faster than our calculation predicts. (This was discovered in the 1960s by <a href="http://www.amnh.org/education/resources/rfl/web/essaybooks/cosmic/p_rubin.html" target="_blank">Vera Rubin and Kent Ford</a>.) &nbsp;It&#8217;s as though they&#8217;re being pulled on by something unseen &#8212; as though the gravity on the stars due to the rest of the galaxy is stronger than we&#8217;ve guessed. Why is this happening?</p>

<p>One possibility is that there is matter out there that we can&#8217;t see, a lot of it, and that matter is inside galaxies and inside clusters of galaxies, exerting a pull that we haven&#8217;t accounted for properly. A huge &#8220;halo&#8221; of dark matter, in this view, surrounds every galaxy (Figure 2).</p>
<p>Clearly, this isn&#8217;t the only logical possibility. Another option is that there could be something wrong with our understanding of gravity. Or there could be some other new force that we don&#8217;t know about yet that has nothing to do with gravity. Or maybe there&#8217;s something wrong with the very laws of motion that we use. But all attempts to make sensible suggestions along these lines have gradually run into conflicts with astronomical observations over the recent decades.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, during those last few decades, a simple version of the &#8220;dark matter&#8221; hypothesis has passed test after test, some of these tests being very complex and subtle. For example, in Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity, gravity pulls on light, and can bend it much the same way that the lenses in eyeglasses bend light. A galaxy or galaxy cluster can serve to magnify objects behind it, and by studying <a href="http://www.space.com/14481-hubble-photo-brightest-galaxy-gravitational-lens.html" target="_blank">these lensing effects</a>, we again conclude there&#8217;s far more matter in galaxies and in clusters than we can see. &nbsp;And there are other arguments too, which I won&#8217;t cover now.</p>
<p>So while an explanation for the fast motion of stars inside galaxies, and galaxies inside clusters, isn&#8217;t 100% sure to be dark matter, it&#8217;s now, after many years of study, in the high 90%s. Don&#8217;t let anyone tell you that scientists rushed to judgment about this; it has been studied for decades, and I can tell you from experience that there&#8217;s a lot more consensus now than there was when I was an beginning undergraduate 30 years ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="color:#339966;">Those traces, when they are finally found, will be exotic particles left over from the Big Bang.</span>&#8221; Will they? Will the dark matter turn out to be particles from the Big Bang? Not necessarily. We know that&#8217;s one possibility, but it&#8217;s not the only one. Since <a title="Questions and Answers About Dark Matter&nbsp;post-LUX" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/31/questions-and-answers-about-dark-matter-post-lux/" target="_blank">I explained this point last week</a>, I&#8217;ll just refer you to that post.</p>
<p>Now here come the big meta-questions: should the New York Times be more careful about what it puts on its editorial page? Should its editors, who are not scientists, talk broadly about a subtle scientific topic without fact-checking with an expert? What are the costs and benefits when they put out oversimplified, and in some ways actually false, information about science on their editorial page?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<pre><em><span style="color:#008000;">Appropriate for General Readership</span></em></pre>
<p>Last week, the <a href="http://lux.brown.edu/LUX_dark_matter/Home.html" target="_blank">LUX experiment</a> reported its results in its search for the dark matter that (speaking roughly) makes up 25% of the stuff in the universe (see <a title="Breaking News: Two Great New Measurements" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/30/breaking-news-two-great-new-measurements/">here for the first report</a> and <a title="Questions and Answers About Dark Matter post-LUX" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/31/questions-and-answers-about-dark-matter-post-lux/">here for some Q&amp;A</a>).  <em>[See <a title="Current Hints of Dark Matter (4/13)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/dark-matter/current-hints-of-dark-matter-413/" target="_blank">this article</a>, specifically the &#8220;Dark Matter Underfoot&#8221; section, for some nontechnical discussion about how experiments like LUX work.]</em>  Shortly thereafter, a number of <a href="LUX Dark matter detector finds no WIMPs, so why are scientists happy?" target="_blank">articles in the media</a> made a big deal out of the fact that, simultaneously,</p>
<ol>
<li>the LUX experiment did not find evidence of dark matter</li>
<li>yet scientists at the LUX experiment appeared to be quite happy</li>
</ol>
<p>as though this was contradictory and mystifying. Actually, if you think about it carefully, this is perfectly normal and typical, and not the slightest bit surprising. But to make sense of it, you do also have to understand the <strong>levels</strong> of &#8220;happiness&#8221; that the LUX scientists are expressing.</p>
<p>The point is that whenever scientists do an experiment whose goal is to look for something whose precise details aren&#8217;t known, there are two stories running simultaneously:</p>
<ol>
<li>The scientists are trying to do the best experiment that they can, in order that their search be as thorough and as expansive as it could possibly be with the equipment that they have available.</li>
<li>The scientists are hoping that the thing that they are looking for (or perhaps something else equally or more interesting) will be within reach of their search.</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that <strong>humans</strong> have control over the first story. The wiser they are at designing their experiment, and the more skillful they are in carrying it out, the more effective their search will be. But they have <em>no</em> control over the second story. Whether their prey lies within their reach, or whether it lies far beyond, requiring the technology of the distant future, is up to <strong>nature</strong>, not humans. In short, story #1 is about skill and talent, but story #2 is about luck. Even a great experiment can&#8217;t do the impossible, and even one that doesn&#8217;t work quite as well as it was supposed to can be fortunate.</p>
<p>Of course, there is some interplay between the stories. A disaster in story #1 precludes a happy ending in story #2; if the experiment doesn&#8217;t work, there won&#8217;t be any discoveries! And the better is the outcome in story #1, the more probable is a success in story #2; a more thorough search is more likely to get lucky.</p>
<p>The LUX researchers, in order to make a discovery, have to be lucky in several ways, as I <a title="Questions and Answers About Dark Matter post-LUX" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/31/questions-and-answers-about-dark-matter-post-lux/" target="_blank">described on Thursday</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dark matter <em>(at least some of it)</em> has to be made from particles which are heavier than <a title="The Nuclei of Atoms: At the Heart of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-nuclei-of-atoms-at-the-heart-of-matter/" target="_blank">protons</a> and have uniform properties;</li>
<li>These particles have to be rather smoothly distributed through the Milky Way galaxy, rather than bound up in clumps the way ordinary matter is, so that some of them are likely, just by chance, to be passing through the earth;</li>
<li>And they have to interact with ordinary matter at a rate that is not insanely small &#8212; no less than a millionth of the interaction rate of high-energy neutrinos with ordinary matter.</li>
</ul>
<p>None of these things is necessarily true, given what we know about dark matter from our measurements of the heavens. And if any one of them is false, no detector similar to LUX will ever find dark matter; we&#8217;ll need other methods, some of which are already under way.</p>
<p>Now, in this context, what&#8217;s the <strong>worst</strong> thing that could happen to a group of scientists who&#8217;ve built an experiment? The worst thing that could happen is that after spending several years preparing the experiment, they find it simply doesn&#8217;t work. <strong><em>This can happen!</em></strong> These are very difficult experiments requiring very special and remarkable techniques, and every now and then, in the history of such experiments, an unexpected problem arises that can&#8217;t be solved without a complete redesign, which is usually too expensive and in any case means years of delay. Or something just explodes and ruins the experiment. Something like this is extremely depressing and often deeply embarrassing.</p>
<p>So if instead the experiment works, the scientists who designed, built and ran it are of course very relieved and reasonably happy. And if, because of a combination of hard work and cleverness, it works <em><strong>better</strong></em> than they expected and as well as they could have hoped, they&#8217;re of course enormously pleased, and proud of their work!</p>
<p>Now what could make them happier still &#8212; even ecstatic, to the point of staying up late drinking entire bottles of champagne? <strong><em>A discovery, of course.</em></strong> Discovering what they&#8217;re looking for, or perhaps something they weren&#8217;t even looking for, if it is truly novel and of fundamental importance.  If that happens, then they won&#8217;t care as much if their experiment worked better than expected&#8230; because, if you&#8217;re an experimental scientist, there&#8217;s nothing, nothing at all, better than discovering something new about nature.</p>
<p>So with this perspective, I think the LUX scientists&#8217; emotions (as conveyed during his talk by Richard Gaitskell of Brown University, the project&#8217;s leader) are actually very easy to understand. They are very happy because their experiment works better than they expected and as well as they hoped&#8230; maybe even better than that. For this, they get the high respect and admiration of their colleagues. But make no mistake: they&#8217;d certainly be <strong>a lot happier</strong> &#8212; overjoyed and humbled &#8212; if they&#8217;d discovered dark matter. For that, they&#8217;d get a place in the history books, major prizes (perhaps a Nobel, if the Nobel Committee could figure out who to give it to), lasting fame, and the almost unimaginable feeling of having uncovered something about nature that no human previously knew, and that (barring a complete collapse of civilization) will never be forgotten. So yes, they&#8217;re <strong>happy</strong>. But <em><strong>not nearly as happy as can be.</strong></em> They&#8217;re frustrated, too, just like the rest of us, that nothing&#8217;s shown up yet.</p>
<p>However, they&#8217;re also <strong>hopeful</strong>. Since they&#8217;ve built such a good experiment, and since they&#8217;ve only run it for such a short time so far, they&#8217;ll have another very reasonable shot at finding dark matter when they run it for about a full year, in 2014. Not only will they run it longer, they&#8217;ll surely also learn, from their experience so far, to be smarter about how they run it. So expect, at the very least, powerful new limits on dark matter from them in eighteen months or so. And maybe, just maybe, something more.</p>
