										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Wow</strong></em>, it was <a title="Happy (Chilly) New Year" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/01/07/happy-chilly-new-year/" target="_blank">unusually cold last week</a>. In a small fraction of the globe. For a couple of days. And what does that cold snap, that big wiggle in the <em><strong><span style="color:#00ccff;">Polar Vortex</span></strong></em> that carries high-atmospheric winds around the North Pole, imply about &#8220;climate change&#8221;, also known as &#8220;global warming&#8221;, also known as &#8220;global weirding&#8221;?</p>
<p>The answer is very simple. <strong>Nothing.</strong></p>
<p>If you heard anyone suggest otherwise &#8212; whether they said that the extreme <em><strong>cold</strong></em> implies that there is <em>no</em> global warming going on, or they said that the <em><strong>extreme</strong></em> cold implies that global warming <em>is</em> happening &#8212; you should seriously question anything that person says when it comes to climate change. Because that person does not respect (or perhaps even understand) the difference between anecdote and evidence; between weather and climate; between a large fluctuation and a small but long-term trend. Or between media hoopla and science.</p>
<p>In the interest of an imperfect analogy: Let me ask you this. Are you generally happier, or less happy, than you were five years ago? Answer this as best you can.</p>
<p>Now let me ask you another question. Did you, within the last month, have a really, really bad day, or a really, really good one?</p>
<p>Does the answer to the second question have much to do with the answer to the first one?</p>
<p>Barring an exceptional recent disaster in your personal or professional life, the fact that, say, last Thursday your car broke down, you locked yourself out of your house, your dog vomited on the carpet and you got caught in the rain without your umbrella does not have anything to do with whether you are a happier person than you were five years ago. Being a happier person has more to do with whether you have a better job, a happier family, a better sense of self-esteem, and things like that. And even if you love your job, you know there are going to be really bad days in the office sometimes. That&#8217;s just the way it goes. We all know that.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the same with <a href="http://www.macrotrends.net/1319/dow-jones-100-year-historical-chart" target="_blank">daily and monthly and yearly fluctuations in the stock market</a> compared to the <a href="http://www.measuringworth.com/datasets/usgdp/graph.php" target="_blank">slow but fairly steady century-long growth of the U.S. economy</a> (both curves corrected for inflation.)</p>
<p><strong><em>So why, when there&#8217;s a big fluctuation in the daily, monthly or even seasonal weather, do people jump up and down about what the implications are for the long-term trends in climate?<span id="more-7104"></span></em></strong></p>
<p>Any one fluctuation, whether hot or cold, dry or wet, windy or calm, is by itself irrelevant. Weather fluctuates; that&#8217;s just how it is. It&#8217;s by no means unusual, now or in the distant past, for temperatures in the central United States to swing by 50ºF (28ºC) in just a few hours. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.weather.com/news/5-extreme-temperature-drops-20130118" target="_blank">a fun story by the Weather Channel</a> listing a few extreme temperature swings, all of which were more dramatic than the recent cold spell.  Weather in the U.S. has seen extremes since before Europeans arrived here and started recording their experiences, and it will continue to do so whether global warming persists or not.</p>
<p>Moreover, the recent cold wasn&#8217;t as exceptional as portrayed in the press, or as it seemed to people under the age of 40. One of the reasons that so many records were set this past week was that January 7th, over the past century, hasn&#8217;t previously seen an exceptionally cold day in the southeast. Specifically, let&#8217;s look at Greensboro, North Carolina, which was <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/coldest-jan-7-ever-15-record-low-temperatures-set-polar-vortex-1531012" target="_blank">described in the press as follows</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Greensboro, N.C., also witnessed a major drop in its record low temperature, going from a previous record of 14 degrees to 5 degrees. &#8220;</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, what were (before this year) the record temps in that town during the first 10 days of January? (see <a href="http://www.erh.noaa.gov/rah/climate/data/gso.daily.records.temp.precip.html">http://www.erh.noaa.gov/rah/climate/data/gso.daily.records.temp.precip.html</a>)</p>
<p>Jan 1: 8<br />
Jan 2: 5<br />
Jan 3: 7<br />
Jan 4: 3<br />
Jan 5: 3<br />
Jan 6: 5<br />
Jan 7: 14 ==&gt; 5 in 2014<br />
Jan 8: 6<br />
Jan 9: 2<br />
Jan 10: 1<br />
Jan 11: -5</p>
<p>In other words, the previous century or so of January 7ths were unusual &#8212; every other day in early January had already seen a very cold day! <em>All this recent cold snap did was bring it into line with other cold early January days!</em> A similar story held true in Atlanta. In short, despite the &#8220;record cold&#8221; media hype, quite a few of the new &#8220;records&#8221; weren&#8217;t especially exceptional for January&#8230; they were &#8220;normal&#8221; records, not worthy of the amazement expressed by reporters and citizens alike.</p>
<p>The issue this highlights is that if you want to tell whether the climate is getting warmer, the record high and low temperatures on a given day aren&#8217;t going to tell you much! The record temperatures fluctuate and are subject to random, extraordinary events. We don&#8217;t know how rare those exceptional events are, and the more wild and spectacular they are, the less we know about them.  If something happens once every one, three or ten centuries, but we only have one century of records, we&#8217;ve only seen it happen once or perhaps twice, if ever.  So when it happens, we can&#8217;t say &#8220;aha, that&#8217;s something that would not have happened if it weren&#8217;t for climate change&#8221;. We can&#8217;t draw such a conclusion, anymore than we can conclude that your stunningly bad day at work last week implies that your job, in the grand scheme of things, isn&#8217;t going to be as fulfilling in future as it used to be.</p>
<p>Take a look at this plot, from <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/NORMS/DisplayNORMS.asp?AirportCode=KSAT&amp;SafeCityName=San_Antonio&amp;StateCode=TX&amp;Units=none&amp;IATA=SAT" target="_blank">the website Weather Underground</a>, which tells us something about the weather and climate in San Antonio, Texas.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">It shows, for each day of the year, over many years, the average high and average low temperatures in blue, and the </span>record daily highs and lows in red. <span style="color:#808080;"><em>[Unfortunately I do not know exactly how many years are included in this data; I would estimate 60 years, but Weather Underground does not provide this important information &#8212; and they should.]  </em></span>Of course the average and record highs and lows all trend higher in the summer and lower in the winter, as expected. But notice:</p>
<ul>
<li>the average highs and lows are smooth curves</li>
<li>the record highs and lows are jagged curves</li>
</ul>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>Because for each day, <em>every year contributes to the average</em>. Year-to-year fluctuations for each day get smoothed out, as do day-to-day fluctuations in each year. So the curve showing the average is smooth as you move from one day to the next.</p>
<p>By contrast, only special, unique, remarkable, extraordinary days contribute to the record high and record low on a particular day. These are subject to large day-to-day fluctuations, because something extraordinary may have happened on January 9th of some 20th century year, but not on January 10th or 8th.</p>
<p>So a specific event with record heat or record cold isn&#8217;t useful for telling us about climate change.  Though impressive, it just represents the vagaries of life that get in the way of us understanding the real long-term trend, just as a truly bad day can make someone forget, for a short while anyway, that his or her life is going pretty well on the whole.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the same with extreme hurricanes and tornadoes, droughts and floods. These are too rare, and require too many elements to come together in a unique mix, for us to easily conclude anything about them. Hurricanes Irene and Sandy were a big deal in and around New York City; but are they signs of global warming?! What about the devastating 1938 hurricane that hit eastern New England? What about the two strong hurricanes that struck New England, a month apart, in 1869? It&#8217;s impossible to conclude that Irene and Sandy are related to global warming/weirding. Only if you see something steady over decades &#8212; the average storm becoming stronger, or the average number of storms rising &#8212; or a dramatic trend &#8212; Irene and Sandy-like storms ceasing to be rare and becoming once-every-other-year events over decades &#8212; will you be able to draw any conclusions from hurricanes that the climate has really changed.</p>
<p>No&#8230; if you want to determine whether global warming is occurring, you must set aside the record high or low temperatures, the extreme storms, the exceptional events&#8230; the ones that the media reports, and the ones that you yourself easily remember. Instead, you need to look at the averages &#8212; which is where the data is sufficient, and sufficiently stable, <a title="Climate Change in Climate Change" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/10/24/climate-change-in-climate-change/" target="_blank">for some conclusion that the Earth has slightly warmed</a> (by just 1 &#8211; 2 ºF = 0.5 &#8211; 1.1ºC &#8211;which is still <a href="http://themadisonenergygroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Ag_Upsala_Glacier.jpg" target="_blank">enough to melt a lot of glaciers</a>)  to be drawn. And even our current 100 years of data from around the globe is just barely enough to make that possible.  I&#8217;ll cover that issue another time.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s not waste our time fishing for red herrings.  Yes, it is possible that an overall small increase in the temperature of the globe will make wild weather more common. But it will be decades before we have enough data to tell whether, in fact, the rare events of which we have so few examples really are more or less common than they used to be.  And no one event, in isolation, should ever be mentioned in the same sentence as &#8220;climate change&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Particles are just so cool, and so very useful.  Scientists can learn about the past &#8212; for example, past climate &#8212; using &#8220;carbon dating&#8221;, a combination of biology and nuclear physics.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2013GL057188/abstract" target="_blank">this article</a> in Geophysics Letters, covered in <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/news/releases/2013/10/23/cu-boulder-led-study-shows-unprecedented-warmth-arctic" target="_blank">this Colorado University press release</a> (with a somewhat inaccurate title), the abstract contains the statements&#8230;</p>
<p><em>&#8230;the extent to which recent Arctic warming has been anomalous with respect to long-term natural climate variability remains uncertain. Here we use 145 radiocarbon dates on rooted tundra plants revealed by receding cold-based ice caps in the Eastern Canadian Arctic to show that 5000 years of regional summertime cooling has been reversed, with average summer temperatures of the last ~100 years now higher than during any century in more than 44,000 years,&#8230;</em></p>
<p>Now how does this work? <span id="more-6820"></span>When the plants were alive, before they were covered with ice, they were taking in carbon from the atmosphere (remember plants absorb carbon dioxide and emit oxygen.) This carbon included both stable carbon (whose <a title="The Nuclei of Atoms: At the Heart of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-nuclei-of-atoms-at-the-heart-of-matter/">nucleus</a> has 6 protons and 6 neutrons) and a form of unstable carbon (whose nucleus has 6 protons and <strong>8</strong> neutrons.) This is the carbon <a title="Isotopes: Variations on an Atom" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/atoms-building-blocks-of-molecules/isotopes-variations-on-an-atom/" target="_blank">isotope</a> known as Carbon-14; its nucleus &#8220;<a title="Why Do Particles Decay?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/why-do-particles-decay/" target="_blank">decays</a>&#8221; to a nitrogen nucleus (by emitting a high-energy electron and an anti-neutrino). If you make some carbon-14 nuclei, half of them will have decayed after about 5400 years; half of those that remain will be gone by the time the next 5400 years have passed; and so on. But the atmosphere always has both stable and unstable carbon, because even though the unstable carbon decays away, collisions of <a title="IceCube: A Giant Frozen Neutrino Catcher" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/how-one-detects-neutrinos/icecube-a-giant-frozen-neutrino-catcher/">cosmic rays</a> (high-energy particles from outer space) with nuclei of atoms in the atmosphere replenishes the supply of Carbon-14.</p>
<p>While it is alive, therefore, the plant is absorbing both stable and unstable carbon, in amounts determined by the amounts in the atmosphere. However, once the plant dies, it takes in no more carbon from the atmosphere, and so its unstable carbon gradually disappears. By measuring the ratio of unstable to stable carbon that remains in the plant, one can infer how long ago the plant died.</p>
<p>If I understand correctly, the above-mentioned paper claims that some plants recently uncovered by melting ice on Baffin Island show no measurable unstable carbon at all. This implies they are at least 45,000 years old, and therefore that this part of Baffin Island is now ice-free for the first time in at least 45,000 years. That&#8217;s much longer than the warm period (the &#8220;Holocene&#8221;, the last 11,000 years) that the earth has been in since the last ice age. In short, the warming that is happening in the Arctic now is not typical of the warm period we&#8217;ve been in.</p>
<p>Is this important? Well, first, the usual but essential caution: as far as I know, this has been done only by one set of researchers so far, so accurate results are not guaranteed. If other researchers, especially ones who look in other parts of the globe, find similar results, that will be much more convincing. Second, what does this really tells us about climate? By itself, not much&#8230; it&#8217;s one data point. But it&#8217;s an interesting one. It contributes to a larger story. What we know for sure is that the Arctic is melting faster than anyone expected, and this result adds to the growing body of evidence that this level of warmth hasn&#8217;t been seen up north for a long, long time.</p>
<p>By the way, note that the question of whether the warming is human-caused is not addressed by this type of research. That requires other methods.</p>

<p><em>My own view? Our uncontrolled experiments on our one and only planet must be curbed.  Scientific evidence from many quarters show definitively that the Earth is warming.  Science can give us arguments, strong but not airtight, that we may be responsible (mainly via carbon emissions, and the greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide).  It cannot tell us reliably how bad the risks of a warmer Earth will be; there are too many uncertainties.  But it seems to me that these are risks we shouldn&#8217;t be taking, period.  We don&#8217;t get to mail-order another planet if we mess this one up.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Professor Richard Muller of UC Berkeley isn&#8217;t the first scientist to be converted to the idea that humans are causing a change in the climate through carbon dioxide emissions.  Nor is he, by a long shot, the most expert among them.  But he&#8217;s one of the most famous, now, because he was also a loud skeptic not long in the past. He&#8217;s described the reasons for his conversion, based on a scientific study that he organized and helped lead, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/30/opinion/the-conversion-of-a-climate-change-skeptic.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all" target="_blank">in a recent op-ed post in the New York Times.</a>  It&#8217;s a little self-serving at best, but makes for interesting reading.<span id="more-4123"></span></p>
<p>Immediately, of course, he&#8217;s being lambasted for everything he&#8217;s done, on all conceivable grounds. <em> Discredit him as fast as possible</em>, is the approach &#8212; instead of <em>let&#8217;s look at the study carefully and see if it does or does not have flaws.</em> Well, I&#8217;m sure most of those attacking him right now haven&#8217;t had time to read his study yet, because it was <a href="http://berkeleyearth.org/results-summary/" target="_blank">just posted</a>.  Let&#8217;s wait a few days and see if anyone makes more intelligent remarks about its limitations.</p>
<p>One interesting question here is Judith Curry, who disagreed with the majority view on Muller&#8217;s panel.  I&#8217;d like to understand her point of view more clearly, though honestly she didn&#8217;t make a good impression on me with her objections last November, which seemed thin and statistically flawed.  My impression is that this time she views the approach to the data used in the most recent Muller et al. paper as disturbingly simplistic.   Maybe it is.  The data is open for any expert to use, so this is an objection that I would think could be settled.  If she&#8217;s right, more complex and complete models applied to the data should give qualitatively different results; let&#8217;s see if they do.</p>
<p>Unlike many bloggers, I&#8217;m not willing to pontificate on a subject in which I&#8217;m not expert.  But personally, I think this whole debate is missing the point anyway.  What we are doing, folks, in dumping all of this carbon dioxide into our atmosphere is an uncontrolled and difficult-to-reverse scientific experiment on our planet&#8230; the only one we&#8217;ve got.  <em>(Hmmm&#8230;  let&#8217;s see what happens to the Earth if we turn up the CO<sub>2</sub>! Gosh, won&#8217;t that be interesting to watch!)</em> Would you do an uncontrolled scientific experiment inside your own home?  You probably wouldn&#8217;t think it very smart to do that.  And if a bunch of apparently intelligent people started warning you this might turn out disastrously &#8212; even if other people who are apparently intelligent disagreed with them &#8212; you might consider that given the uncertainty, the question might turn on an issue of prudence.  Perhaps it would be <strong>wise</strong> to get control of this experiment before it has a chance to take control of us.</p>
