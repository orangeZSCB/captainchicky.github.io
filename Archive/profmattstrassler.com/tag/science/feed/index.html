										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t know what all the fuss is about &#8220;alternative facts.&#8221; Why, we scientists use them all the time!</p>
<p>For example, because of my political views, I teach physics students that gravity pulls down. That&#8217;s why the students I teach, when they go on to be engineers, put wheels on the bottom corners of cars, so that the cars don&#8217;t scrape on the ground. But in some countries, the physicists teach them that gravity pulls whichever way the country&#8217;s leaders instruct it to. That&#8217;s why their engineers build flying carpets as transports for their country&#8217;s troops. It&#8217;s a much more effective way to bring an army into battle, if your politics allows it.  We ought to consider it here.</p>
<p>Another example: in my physics class I claim that energy is &#8220;conserved&#8221; (in the physics sense) &#8212; it is never created out of nothing, nor is it ever destroyed. In our daily lives, energy is taken in with food, converted into special biochemicals for storage, and then used to keep us warm, maintain the pumping of our hearts, allow us to think, walk, breathe &#8212; everything we do. Those are my facts. But in some countries, the facts and laws are different, and energy can be created from nothing. The citizens of those countries never need to eat; it is a wonderful thing to be freed from this requirement. It&#8217;s great for their military, too, to not have to supply food for troops, or fuel for tanks and airplanes and ships. Our only protection against invasion from these countries is that if they crossed our borders they&#8217;d suddenly need fuel tanks.</p>
<p>Facts are what you make them; it&#8217;s entirely up to you. You need a good, well-thought-out system of facts, of course; otherwise they won&#8217;t produce the answers that you want. But just first figure out what you want to be true, and then go out and find the facts that make it true. That&#8217;s the way science has always been done, and the best scientists all insist upon this strategy.  As a simple illustration, compare the photos below.  Which picture has more people in it?   Obviously, the answer depends on what facts you&#8217;ve chosen to use.   [Picture copyright Reuters]  If you can&#8217;t understand that, you&#8217;re not ready to be a serious scientist!</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d44bf9ac740cfa2e4c015e985cf20e4ec8d6fdc9/r=540/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove3/29906170001/201701/2306/29906170001_5290953783001_5290938262001-vs.jpg" /></p>
<p>A third example: when I teach physics to students, I instill in them the notion that quantum mechanics controls the atomic world, and underlies the transistors in every computer and every cell phone. But the uncertainty principle that arises in quantum mechanics just isn&#8217;t acceptable in some countries, so they don&#8217;t factualize it. They don&#8217;t use seditious and immoral computer chips there; instead they use proper vacuum tubes. One curious result is that their computers are the size of buildings. The CDC advises you not to travel to these countries, and certainly not to take electronics with you. Not only might your cell phone explode when it gets there, you yourself might too, since your own molecules are held together with quantum mechanical glue. At least you should bring a good-sized bottle of our local facts with you on your travels, and take a good handful before bedtime.</p>
<p>Hearing all the naive cries that facts aren&#8217;t for the choosing, I became curious about what our schools are teaching young people. So I asked a friend&#8217;s son, a bright young kid in fourth grade, what he&#8217;d been learning about alternatives and science. Do you know what he answered?!  I was shocked. &#8220;Alternative facts?&#8221;, he said. &#8220;You mean <strong>lies</strong>?&#8221; Sheesh. Kids these days&#8230; What are we teaching them? It&#8217;s a good thing we&#8217;ll soon have a new secretary of education.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m always amused at how very reasonable remarks so often generate attacks from unreasonable people.  I wrote <a title="“Supersymmetry Dealt a Blow”?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/11/13/supersymmetry-dealt-a-blow/" target="_blank">a perfectly ordinary post about what one does and doesn&#8217;t learn</a> from <a title="First News from Kyoto Conference" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/11/12/first-news-from-kyoto-conference/" target="_blank">LHCb&#8217;s important new measurement</a> at the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC] (and in fact I <em>overstated</em> the significance of the result &#8212; more on that later), and somehow I touched off a mini-firestorm.  Well, that just indicates how essential it is to have calm people expressing sensible points of view.  When people become so politicized that they can&#8217;t distinguish propaganda from science, that&#8217;s not good.</p>
<p>Forget supersymmetry &#8212; because none of my remarks have <em>anything</em> to do with this theory in particular, and the theory doesn&#8217;t deserve the excessive attention it&#8217;s getting.  Take any theory: call it Theory X.  Extra dimensions; compositeness of quarks and leptons; non-commutative spacetime; grand unification; your-theory-here.  The idea behind theory X may be very clever, but as always, there are many variants of theory X, because an idea is almost never precise enough to permit a unique realization.  Each variant makes definite predictions, but keep in mind that <em>detailed experimental predictions may very well differ greatly from variant to variant.</em></p>
<p>Now, here is a logical fact:  one of two options is true.</p>
<ul>
<li>Option A: One variant of theory X is &#8220;correct&#8221; (its predictions agree with nature) while all other variants are &#8220;wrong&#8221; (disagree with nature)</li>
<li>Option B: All variants of theory X are wrong.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nature is what it is; there are no other options (and this is not the place for a discussion about this basic scientific assumption, so <em>pace</em>, please, philosophers.). <em>[More precisely about option A: the space of variants is continuous, so the correct statement is that an arbitrary small region in this space is correct; you can put in the correct calculus vocabulary as you like.  I&#8217;ll stick with the imprecise language for brevity.]</em></p>
<p>For either option, as more and more data is collected, more and more variants of theory X will become &#8220;dead&#8221; &#8212; excluded because of a disagreement with data.  Therefore &#8212; <em><strong>obviously!</strong></em> &#8212; a reduction in the number of live (i.e. unexcluded) models always takes place over time.  And this has <em>absolutely no bearing</em> on whether, at the end, all variants of X will be dead, or one (or perhaps several very similar ones) are still alive.</p>
<p>And thus it makes absolutely no sense to describe, as a &#8220;blow to theory X&#8221; &#8212; in particular, to the idea behind theory X &#8212; a measurement that excludes (&#8220;kills&#8221;) even a big fraction, <em>but not virtually all</em>, of the variants of theory X.  It&#8217;s certainly a blow to those variants; in fact, it is a fatal blow for them.  But it does <em><strong>nothing</strong></em> to distinguish between Option A and Option B.  It only tells us that if Option A is true, the variant of X that will be alive at the end is not among the ones that have just been killed.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t rocket science, folks.  It&#8217;s logic.  <em>[Well &#8211; As a commenter points out, it&#8217;s  not &#8220;logic&#8221; in the strictest sense; but it is basic scientific reasoning.]</em> And if we take theory X to be the Standard Model itself, I&#8217;ve just described its history.<span id="more-4983"></span></p>
<p>The counter-argument?  &#8220;Well, but if we know which variants of theory X are more likely, then if we rule out the likely ones, we can say the theory X is now less likely.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no point in arguing about this claim, because the premise is typically wrong: we do <strong>not</strong> typically know which variants of theory X are more likely.  Neither general scientific reasoning nor scientific history provide a reliable guide.  It&#8217;s not necessarily the simplest ones that are more likely; it&#8217;s not necessarily the most symmetric ones; it&#8217;s not necessarily the ones that most efficiently resolve the problem that the inventors of the idea intended to solve.  Go back and read the history of the Standard Model, and tell me with a straight face that theorists 40 years ago would have guessed that nature is the way it is.  Actually, many are still alive; you can just ask Steve Weinberg, or Sheldon Glashow, or the Higgs particle inventors, what they thought back then, and whether the variant of the Standard Model that we now find ourselves using was considered likely back in, say, 1974, or 1984.  I know from my own experience that it wasn&#8217;t considered likely in 1988, when I started graduate school.</p>
<p>Now, a word about the politics. <a title="Supersymmetry — What Is It?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/supersymmetry-what-is-it/" target="_blank">Supersymmetry</a> is kicked around like a football now, and this ridiculous display is an embarrassment to science.  The theory, specifically as something we would observe at the LHC, was wildly over-promoted by certain people.  And this promotion was strongly resented by certain other people.  I&#8217;m not interested in this political debate, and I&#8217;m not alone among my theory colleagues, in the United States especially.  I&#8217;m interested in nature.  The supersymmetry zealots ought to remember that signs of supersymmetry were quite reasonably expected to show up in the 1980s or 1990s, at the LEP II collider if not before; from many points of view, supersymmetry&#8217;s been in increasing question ever since then.   The dark matter argument that bolsters it is full of holes; the grand unification argument that bolsters it is compelling but thin, and need not lead to detectable superpartners at the LHC.  The naturalness argument (cf. the <a title="The Hierarchy Problem" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/" target="_blank">hierarchy problem</a>) that motivates it has been under some suspicion since <a title="A Nobel Prize That’s No Surprise" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/10/04/a-nobel-prize-thats-no-surprise/" target="_blank">the 1998 discovery that the universe&#8217;s expansion is accelerating</a>.   But meanwhile, the anti-supersymmetry zealots ought to remember that the death (or &#8220;hospitalization&#8221;?!) of supersymmetry has been declared, by physicists and by the press (and nowadays by bloggers), numerous times already over the past few decades; the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14680570" target="_blank">latest declaration by the BBC&#8217;s reporter</a> is nowhere near the first (see <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/05/science/315-physicists-report-failure-in-search-for-supersymmetry.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2011/07/27/the-lhc-the-tevatron-and-the-higgs-boson/" target="_blank">here</a>, for instance), and it won&#8217;t be the last.   Similarly, classic technicolor, which lacks a Higgs-like particle, was declared dead (or hospitalized) many times over my career, at least as far back as the early 1990s, but it really wasn&#8217;t until this July, when a particle was discovered resembling a Standard Model Higgs particle, that the evidence against Higgs-particle-less classic technicolor became very strong (and even now there are people who claim a few variants of classic technicolor are still alive.)</p>
<p>In my view, we (scientists) should disregard the politics, and focus on the hard work that actually needs to be done, by experimentalists and by theorists, to make sure we close as many of the remaining loopholes as we can, for as many types of theories as we can.  Certain outsiders who aren&#8217;t actually doing anything useful will say we&#8217;re wasting our time, and some will say that the Standard Model is &#8220;obviously&#8221; true, but we have to ignore their absurd and irresponsible statements, and defend our right and our obligation to do our job properly.   And that job is to <a title="LHC Program Evolving: From Broad Searches To Precision Tests" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/07/16/lhc-program-evolving-from-broad-searches-to-precision-tests/" target="_blank">test the Standard Model at the LHC in every way possible</a>, prodding it and checking it, excluding as many variants of every reasonable theory X that we can think of, until we have squeezed every available drop of information out of the LHC&#8217;s data.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My neighborhood of New York City may remain without power for a few more days, but fortunately visible signs of damage are limited &#8212; none of the widespread destruction found along the immediate coast of the city and of nearby communities, where the sea rose and swallowed up land that had not seen salt water in many decades, even centuries.  Many trees are down, and countless houses and businesses are wiped out by the sea&#8217;s wrath, even entire beach communities. The numbers of lost homes are surely in the thousands, if not more, with 100 houses alone destroyed in a runaway fire in the neighborhood of Breezy Point, cut off from firefighters by the storm&#8217;s high water.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many people along the coast, lulled into complacency by the fact that last year&#8217;s Tropical Storm (formerly Hurricane) Irene was a bit less furious along the coast than was forecast, decided not to evacuate. Unfortunately indeed, because the forecast for Hurricane Sandy was worse than for Irene, and this time, there was no lucky break to make the reality of the storm significantly less severe than the worst-case prediction.  I myself know of households who decided to evacuate at the last minute and almost didn&#8217;t make it out alive, and others who rode out the storm and found themselves in considerable danger. That so many people remained in harm&#8217;s way required &#8220;first responders&#8221;, as they are termed here, mainly members of the police and fire departments, to make many rescues, quite a few of which wouldn&#8217;t have been necessary had people heeded the warnings. For risking their lives to save so many others, the first responders are widely and justifiably hailed as heroes.</p>
<p>Also deserving of high praise, in my view, are some of the leading politicians and other civic leaders in our region&#8217;s states and cities.  There are quite of few of them whom I don&#8217;t agree with politically and whom I personally don&#8217;t like very much, but on the whole they all seem very smart.   And in this case they understood the risks, took them seriously, and made prudent decisions to order evacuations of areas in danger and to protect public property.  They deserve a lot of credit for their non-nonsense approach.</p>
<p>But I feel that there&#8217;s an important story that the press is almost ignoring.  There&#8217;s another group of people, little-mentioned in the media, who probably saved more lives and property than anyone else.  I refer to the experts at the National Hurricane Center (<a href="http://nhc.noaa.gov/" target="_blank">NHC</a>), and more generally the various branches of the National Weather Service (<a href="http://www.weather.gov/" target="_blank">NWS</a>) and its parent, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (<a href="http://www.noaa.gov/" target="_blank">NOAA</a>).<span id="more-4856"></span></p>
<p>As I already suggested in <a title="North-East Winds A-Blowin’" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/10/29/north-east-winds-a-blowin/" target="_blank">my post from Monday</a>, we should view the forecast of Hurricane Sandy&#8217;s sudden turn toward the coast of New Jersey, and its transformation from a minor category 1 hurricane into an uncategorizable (but categorical) monster, as a stunning achievement &#8212; a historic success of scientific research.  Actually it appears to be several stunning accomplishments in one: the forecast of the unusual track; the forecast of the unusual increase in strength and size; the forecast of a powerful blizzard in the mountains of West Virginia and other nearby states; and the forecast of the extremely high storm surge along Long Island, northern New Jersey and New York Harbor that would prove to be some of the most damaging elements of the storm.  These forecasts were all of highly complex and interrelated phenomena, and very challenging even for the most advanced scientific methods.</p>
<p>And what amazes me is that the forecasters did this successfully <strong><em>despite never having observed a storm of this type before.</em></strong></p>
<p>This, of course, is how science is supposed to work, when it is at its best.  From studies of simpler examples, focusing on one or two elements at a time, scientists guess equations that allow rudimentary predictions of complex phenomena such as fluids <em>(i.e. gasses and liquids)</em> in general, weather more specifically and hurricanes in particular.  Over time, looking at predictions that have succeeded and others that have failed, they improve the equations, accounting for more and more of the underlying processes.  And finally the equations are good enough that they work most of the time; anyone who follows hurricane forecasting knows that the paths of hurricanes are much more reliably predicted than they were even fifteen years ago.</p>
<p>Yet when the day comes that an unusual combination of events arises &#8212; a hurricane moving north, a blocking air pattern to the east, a strong front to the west, an upper level disturbance moving south, etc. &#8212; and the equations respond by predicting a storm of unprecedented power on an extraordinary track, then even the bravest of scientists has to wonder: have the equations gone mad?  Have they been asked to predict the future in an extreme situation where they cannot be trusted?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure the experts were nervous about their forecast.  But as time went on and all of the different computer models, which are similar in their science but differ in their details, gave more or less the same prediction, they appeared to become more and more confident.  And they got it basically right.</p>
<p>Imagine, for a moment, that no one had invested over the last few decades in hurricane forecasting&#8230; that government-funded long-term research was viewed as a waste of money, and that the only funding provided was for research that was likely to lead to near-term economic benefit.  Well, none of those predictions would have been there for us last weekend.  On Monday, a breezy, raw, rainy fall morning, we all would have gone to work with no special worries&#8230; until we headed home for the evening rush hour.  And then we would have found ourselves stuck on the roads by the tens of thousands in traffic jams, unable to get home, as trees fell and rivers flooded, highways became impassable, electricity went out, subway trains were stopped by rising water, and heaven knows what else.  As the evening high tide arrived in New York and Connecticut, nine feet above normal, and as the storm&#8217;s worst rains and winds pounded the New Jersey Coast, many people would have been trapped, and the number of trains, planes, boats, buses, cars, power plants, homes and businesses that would have been unprotected against water damage would have been enormously higher than it was.</p>

<p>This nightmare isn&#8217;t fiction; it&#8217;s history. Something much like it did happen in 1938, in the <a href="http://www.northshorewx.com/Hurricane19380921.asp" target="_blank">Long Island Express hurricane</a>, though fortunately in a somewhat less populated area.  It didn&#8217;t happen this time, because we had many days of warning.  We were told exactly what to worry about &#8212; that there would be many hours of strong winds and rain, tremendous tree damage, flooding along the coast, feet of snow inland.  In New York City we were warned how high the high tide might be: 6 to 11 feet above normal.  (The actual storm surge was nine feet in New York Harbor, a total tide of nearly 14 feet above low water, easily enough to flood the subway and car tunnels and many streets along the waterfront.)   Thanks to these warnings, people were evacuated from danger zones, trains were moved to high ground, highways that often flood were closed, and resources that were needed for cleanup, especially for restoration of power, were brought into position to be ready as soon as the storm was over.  Just imagine the death and damage we might be reading about today, had this not happened.</p>
<p>All the talk in the media is about the 20 or 30 billion dollars that repairs from this storm might cost.  But even though it can&#8217;t be easily estimated, shouldn&#8217;t there be some discussion of the additional billions, perhaps tens of billions, that the National Hurricane Center saved this country in reduced damage and in reduced loss of productivity&#8230; significantly more money than was spent on the entire NOAA budget this year?  And then there are the lives saved.  Those of us who, thanks to the forecast, chose to evacuate, buy extra food and medicine, stay home from work, put off travel, keep our kids home, invite our elderly relatives to stay, and so forth ought all to send a heartfelt thank you note to the forecasters and to all the people who made those forecasts possible &#8212; everyone from the Hurricane Hunter aviators who fly into hurricanes like Sandy to collect the best possible data about these storms to the no-longer-young scientists who spent decades patiently trying to understand what makes these storms tick.  They deserve to be celebrated for what they are: heroes.</p>
