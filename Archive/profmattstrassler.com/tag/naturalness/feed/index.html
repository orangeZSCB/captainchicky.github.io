										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greetings from the last day of the conference &#8220;<a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/290373/" target="_blank">Naturalness 2014</a>&#8220;, where theorists and experimentalists involved with the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC] are discussing <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/naturalness/" target="_blank">one of the most widely-discussed questions in high-energy physics:</a> <em>are the laws of nature in our universe &#8220;natural&#8221; (= &#8220;generic&#8221;), and if not, why not?</em> It&#8217;s so widely discussed that one of my concerns coming in to the conference was whether anyone would have anything new to say that hadn&#8217;t already been said many times.</p>
<p>What makes the Standard Model&#8217;s equations (which are the equations governing <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the known particles</a>, including the simplest possible Higgs particle) so <a title="Naturalness and the Standard Model" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/naturalness/" target="_blank">&#8220;unnatural&#8221; (i.e. &#8220;non-generic&#8221;)</a> is that when one combines the Standard Model with, say, Einstein&#8217;s gravity equations. or indeed with any other equations involving additional particles and fields, one finds that the parameters in the equations (such as the strength of the electromagnetic force or the interaction of the electron with the Higgs field) must be chosen so that certain effects almost perfectly cancel, to one part in a gazillion* (something like 10³²). If this cancellation fails, the universe described by these equations looks nothing like the one we know. <a title="Naturalness and the Standard Model" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/naturalness/" target="_blank">I&#8217;ve discussed this non-genericity in some detail here.</a></p>
<p>*<em>A gazillion, as defined on this website, is a number so big that it even makes particle physicists and cosmologists flinch. [From Old English, gajillion.]</em></p>
<p>Most theorists who have tried to address the naturalness problem have tried adding new principles, and consequently new particles, to the Standard Model&#8217;s equations, so that this extreme cancellation is no longer necessary, or so that the cancellation is automatic, or something to this effect. Their suggestions have included <a title="Supersymmetry" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/" target="_blank">supersymmetry</a>, warped <a title="Extra Dimensions" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/extra-dimensions/" target="_blank">extra dimensions</a>, little Higgs, etc&#8230;. but importantly, these examples are only natural if the lightest of the new particles that they predict have masses that are around or below 1 <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/" target="_blank">TeV</a>/c², and must therefore be directly observable at the LHC (with a few very interesting exceptions, which I&#8217;ll talk about some other time). The details are far too complex to go into here, but the constraints from what was <em><strong>not</strong></em> discovered at LHC in 2011-2012 implies that most of these examples don&#8217;t work perfectly. Some partial non-automatic cancellation, not at one part in a gazillion but at one part in 100, seems to be necessary for almost all of the suggestions made up to now.</p>
<p>So what are we to think of this?<span id="more-7774"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe one of the few examples that is entirely natural and is still consistent with current data is correct, and will turn up at the LHC in 2015 or 2016 or so, when the LHC begins running at higher energy per collision than was available in 2011-2012.</li>
<li>Maybe one of the examples that isn&#8217;t entirely natural is correct. After all, one part in 100 isn&#8217;t awful to contemplate, unlike one part in a gazillion. We do know of other weird things about the world that are improbable, such as the fact that the Sun and the Moon appear to be almost exactly the same size in the Earth&#8217;s sky. So maybe our universe is slightly non-generic, and therefore discoveries of new particles that we might have expected to see in 2011-2012 are going to be delayed until 2015 or beyond.</li>
<li>Maybe naturalness is simply not a good guide to guessing our universe&#8217;s laws, perhaps because the universe&#8217;s history, or its structure, forced it to be extremely non-generic, or perhaps because the universe as a whole is generic but huge and variegated (this is often called a &#8220;multiverse&#8221;, but be careful, because that word is used in several very different ways &#8212; see here for discussion) and we can only live in an extremely non-generic part of it.</li>
<li>Maybe naturalness is not a good guide because there&#8217;s something wrong with the naturalness argument, perhaps because quantum field theory itself, on which the argument rests, or some other essential assumption, is breaking down.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the most important issues at this conference are: how can we determine experimentally which of these possibilities is correct (or whether another we haven&#8217;t thought of is correct)? In this regard, what measurements do we need to make at the LHC in 2015 and beyond? What theoretical directions concerning naturalness have been underexplored, and might any of them suggest new measurements at LHC (or elsewhere) that have not yet been attempted?</p>
<p>I am afraid my time is too limited to report on highlights. Most of the progress reported at this conference has been incremental rather than major steps; there weren&#8217;t any big new solutions to the naturalness problem proposed.  But it has been a good opportunity for an exchange of ideas among theorists and experimentalists, with a number of new approaches to LHC measurements being presented and discussed, and with some interesting conversation regarding the theoretical and conceptual issues surrounding naturalness, selection bias (sometimes called &#8220;anthropics&#8221;), and the behavior of quantum field theory.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Along with two senior postdocs (Andrey Katz of Harvard and Nathaniel Craig of Rutgers) I&#8217;ve been visiting the University of Maryland all week, taking advantage of end-of-academic-term slowdowns to spend a few days just thinking hard, with some very bright and creative colleagues, about the implications of what we have discovered <em>(a <a title="Discovery of the Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-discovery-of-the-higgs/">Higgs particle of mass 125-126 GeV/c²</a>)</em> and have not discovered <em>(any other new particles or unexpected high-energy phenomena)</em> so far at the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC].</p>
<p>The basic questions that face us most squarely are:</p>
<p>Is the <a title="Naturalness and the Standard Model" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/naturalness/" target="_blank">naturalness puzzle</a></p>
<ol>
<li>resolved by a clever mechanism that adds new particles and forces to the ones we know?</li>
<li>resolved by properly interpreting the history of the universe?</li>
<li>nonexistent due to our somehow misreading the lessons of quantum field theory?</li>
<li>altered dramatically by modifying the rules of quantum field theory and gravity altogether?</li>
</ol>
<p>If (1) is true, it&#8217;s possible that a clever new &#8220;mechanism&#8221; is required.  (Old mechanisms that remove or ameliorate the naturalness puzzle include <a title="Supersymmetry — What Is It?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/supersymmetry-what-is-it/" target="_blank">supersymmetry</a>, little Higgs, warped <a title="Extra Dimensions" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/extra-dimensions/" target="_blank">extra dimensions</a>, etc.; all of these are still possible, but if one of them is right, it&#8217;s mildly surprising we&#8217;ve seen no sign of it yet.)  Since the Maryland faculty I&#8217;m talking to (Raman Sundrum, Zakaria Chacko and Kaustubh Agashe) have all been involved in inventing clever new mechanisms in the past (with names like Randall-Sundrum [i.e. warped extra dimensions], Twin Higgs, Folded Supersymmetry, and various forms of Composite Higgs), it&#8217;s a good place to be thinking about this possibility.  There&#8217;s good reason to focus on mechanisms that, unlike most of the known ones, do not lead to new particles that are affected by the strong nuclear force. (The Twin Higgs idea that Chacko invented with Hock-Seng Goh and Roni Harnik is an example.)  The particles predicted by such scenarios could easily have escaped notice so far, and be hiding in LHC data.</p>
<p>Sundrum (some days anyway) thinks the most likely situation is that, just by chance, the universe has turned out to be a <em>little</em> bit unnatural &#8212; not a lot, but enough that the solution to the naturalness puzzle may lie at higher energies outside LHC reach.  That would be unfortunate for particle physicists who are impatient to know the answer&#8230; unless we&#8217;re lucky and a remnant from that higher-energy phenomenon accidentally has ended up at low-energy, low enough that the LHC can reach it.</p>
<p>But perhaps we just haven&#8217;t been creative enough yet to guess the right mechanism, or alter the ones we know of to fit the bill&#8230; and perhaps the clues are already in the LHC&#8217;s data, waiting for us to ask the right question.</p>
<p>I view option (2) as deeply problematic.  On the one hand, there&#8217;s a good argument that the universe might be immense, far larger than the part we can see, with different regions having very different laws of particle physics &#8212; and that the part we live in might appear very &#8220;unnatural&#8221; just because that very same unnatural appearance is <strong><em>required</em></strong> for stars, planets, and life to exist.  To be over-simplistic: if, in the parts of the universe that have no Higgs particle with mass below 700 GeV/c², the physical consequences prevent complex molecules from forming, then it&#8217;s not surprising we live in a place with a Higgs particle below that mass.   <em>[It&#8217;s not so different from saying that the earth is a very unusual place from some points of view &#8212; rocks near stars make up a very small fraction of the universe &#8212; but that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s surprising that we find ourselves in such an unusual location, because a planet is one of the few places that life could evolve.]</em></p>
<p>Such an argument is compelling for the cosmological constant problem.  But it&#8217;s really hard to come up with an argument that a Higgs particle with a very low mass (and corresponding low non-zero masses for the other known particles) is <em>required</em> for life to exist.  Specifically, the mechanism of &#8220;technicolor&#8221; (in which the Higgs field is generated as a composite object through a new, strong force) seems to allow for a habitable universe, but with <strong>no</strong> naturalness puzzle &#8212; so why don&#8217;t we find ourselves in a part of the universe where it&#8217;s technicolor, not a Standard Model-like Higgs, that shows up at the LHC?  Sundrum, formerly a technicolor expert, has thought about this point (with David E. Kaplan), and he agrees this is a significant problem with option (2).</p>
<p>By the way, option (2) is sometimes called the &#8220;anthropic principle&#8221;.  But it&#8217;s neither a principle nor &#8220;anthro-&#8221; (human-) related&#8230; it&#8217;s simply a bias (not in the negative sense of the word, but simply in the sense of something that affects your view of a situation) from the fact that, heck, life can only evolve in places where life can evolve.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">(3) is really hard for me to believe.  The naturalness argument boils down to this:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Quantum fields fluctuate;</li>
<li>Fluctuations carry energy, called &#8220;zero-point energy&#8221;, which can be calculated and is very large;</li>
<li>The energy of the fluctuations of a field depends on the corresponding particle&#8217;s mass;</li>
<li>The particle&#8217;s mass, for the known particles, depends on the Higgs field;</li>
<li>Therefore the energy of empty space depends strongly on the Higgs field</li>
</ul>
<p>Unless one of these five statements is wrong (good luck finding a mistake &#8212; every one of them involves completely basic issues in quantum theory and in the Higgs mechanism for giving masses) then there&#8217;s a naturalness puzzle.  The solution may be simple from a certain point of view, but it won&#8217;t come from just waving the problem away.</p>
<p>(4) I&#8217;d love for this to be the real answer, and maybe it is.  If our understanding of quantum field theory and Einstein&#8217;s gravity leads us to a naturalness problem whose solution should presumably reveal itself at the LHC, and yet nature refuses to show us a solution, then maybe it&#8217;s a naive use of field theory and gravity that&#8217;s at fault. But it may take a very big leap of faith, and insight, to see how to jump off this cliff and yet land on one&#8217;s feet.  Sundrum is well-known as one of the most creative and fearless individuals in our field, especially when it comes to this kind of thing. I&#8217;ve been discussing some radical notions with him, but mostly I&#8217;ve been enjoying hearing his many past insights and ideas&#8230; and about the equations that go with them.   Anyone can speculate, but it&#8217;s the equations (and the predictions, testable at least in principle if not in practice, that you can derive from them) that transform pure speculations into something that deserves the name &#8220;theoretical physics&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the weekend, someone said to me, breathlessly, that they&#8217;d read that &#8220;<strong>Results from the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC] have blown string theory out of the water.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><em>Good Heavens!</em> I replied. <em>Who fed you that line of rubbish?!</em></p>
<p>Well, I&#8217;m not sure how this silliness got started, but it&#8217;s completely wrong. Just in case some of you or your friends have heard the same thing, let me explain why it&#8217;s wrong.</p>
<p>First, <strong>a distinction</strong> &#8212; one that is rarely made, especially by the more rabid bloggers, both those who are string lovers and those that are string haters. [Both types mystify me.] <a title="Strings: History, Development, Impact" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/06/strings-history-development-impact/" target="_blank">String theory has several applications</a>, and you need to keep them straight. Let me mention two.</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Application number 1:</strong> this is the one you&#8217;ve heard about. String theory is a <strong>candidate</strong> <em>(and only a <strong>candidate</strong>)</em> for a &#8220;theory of everything&#8221; &#8212; a silly term, if you ask me, for what it really means is &#8220;a theory of all of nature&#8217;s particles, forces and space-time&#8221;. It&#8217;s not a theory of genetics or a theory of cooking or a theory of how to write a good blog post. But it&#8217;s still a pretty cool thing. This is the theory <em>(i.e. a set of consistent equations and methods that describes relativistic quantum strings)</em> that&#8217;s supposed to explain quantum gravity and all of particle physics, and if it succeeded, that would be fantastic.</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#993366;"><strong>Application number 2:</strong> String theory can serve as a <strong>tool</strong>. You can use its <em>mathematics</em>, and/or the <em>physical insights</em> that you can gain by thinking about and calculating how strings behave, to solve or partially solve problems in other subjects. (<a title="From String Theory to the Large Hadron Collider" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/08/15/from-string-theory-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#993366;">Here&#8217;s an example</span></a>.) These subjects include quantum field theory and advanced mathematics, and if you work in these areas, you may really not care much about application number 1. <em><strong>Even if application number 1 were ruled out by data, we&#8217;d still continue to use string theory as a tool.</strong></em></span> <em>Consider this: if you grew up learning that a hammer was a religious idol to be worshipped, and later you decided you didn&#8217;t believe that anymore, would you throw out all your hammers? No. They&#8217;re still useful even if you don&#8217;t worship them.</em></li>
</ol>
<p>BUT: today we <strong>are</strong> talking about <span style="color:#ff0000;">Application Number 1</span>: string theory as a candidate theory of all particles, etc.<span id="more-6648"></span></p>
<p>Now what&#8217;s so silly about this notion that the LHC has ruled out string theory is that<strong> the whole reason a lot of people hate string theory is that it doesn&#8217;t make any testable predictions</strong>! So obviously you can&#8217;t rule it out with current experiments&#8230; that would <em><strong>require</strong></em> testable predictions!</p>
<p><strong>Caution!</strong> <span style="color:#800000;">Do not interpret the above bold-faced statement to mean that string theory as a theory of all particles etc. makes <em>no</em> predictions at all.</span> <em><strong>String theory certainly makes predictions.</strong></em> For instance (taking string theory in its most vanilla form), string theory predicts that all particles are actually tiny strings.  And if you were to take one electron with a motion-energy of a million million million <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/" target="_blank">GeV</a> or more, and take another electron with similar energy but moving in the opposite direction, and slam them into each other, you would find the scattering is governed by the formulas for how relativistic quantum strings bounce off each other.  Specifically,</p>
<ul>
<li>The probability that they would scatter at large angle is extremely small.</li>
<li>The probability that they scatter at a small angle has a bell-shaped distribution centered around zero angle; the width of the bell shrinks as the energy increases.</li>
<li>The overall scattering rate increases with energy.</li>
<li>And since all particles (not just electrons) are strings, if string theory is right, the same results should hold for scattering of any two particles, not just electrons.</li>
</ul>
<p>These features are very different from what you&#8217;d expect if particles had no detectable size or shape.  Also, the formulas are more precise than my words, so these are things you could check in detail, not just qualitatively.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s only one problem: <em>although these predictions would allow definitive test of the theory, the tests can&#8217;t be carried out with current or currently imaginable technology.</em>  In current experiments, the scattering energy is far too low to detect whether the particles of nature are tiny strings, as small as (vanilla) string theory would suggest.  The pattern of scattering we see when two electrons scatter is what you&#8217;d expect if particles had no intrinsic size or shape. In short, <em><strong>we can&#8217;t actually build a particle accelerator capable of </strong></em><strong>testing</strong><em><strong> these predictions</strong></em>; our technology is about a thousand million million times below where it would need to be, so this isn&#8217;t going to happen soon. Nor does nature provide a natural laboratory; cosmic rays aren&#8217;t nearly energetic enough.   <strong>The problem is practical, not one of principle</strong>.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">So why would anyone even think for a moment that string theory was ruled out by the LHC? It apparently comes from the following line of argument.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>String theory predicts <a title="Supersymmetry — What Is It?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/supersymmetry-what-is-it/" target="_blank">supersymmetry</a>.</li>
<li>Supersymmetry has been ruled out by the LHCb experiment at the LHC, so string theory is ruled out too.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Both of these statements are wrong, in multiple ways.</strong></p>
<p>First, <em>does string theory predict supersymmetry</em>? Even if supersymmetry is present in nature, there is nothing in string theory that predicts that supersymmetry lies hidden at the energies that can be accessed by the LHC; i.e., even if there exist <a title="Supersymmetry — What Is It?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/supersymmetry-what-is-it/" target="_blank">superpartner particles</a>, they may be far, far too heavy for the LHC to find.  Furthermore, although supersymmetry is in some subtle ways built deeply into string theory (as we currently understand it), that doesn&#8217;t mean that it shows up in a simple way: it is not necessarily the case that there will be a recognizable <a title="Supersymmetry — What Is It?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/supersymmetry-what-is-it/" target="_blank">superpartner particle</a> for every particle, as traditional supersymmetry predicts.</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The only situation in which we expect supersymmetry to show up at the LHC is if supersymmetry is solving <span style="color:#008000;"><a title="Naturalness and the Standard Model" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/naturalness/" target="_blank">the naturalness problem of the Standard Model</a>,</span> and thus stabilizing <a title="The Hierarchy Problem" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#008000;">the hierarchy between the extreme weakness of gravity and the strengths of the other forces</span></a>.</strong></span>  For short, let&#8217;s call this &#8220;<em><strong>natural supersymmetry</strong></em>&#8221;.  If supersymmetry exists in nature but has nothing to do with the naturalness problem, we don&#8217;t have any reason to expect to find any sign of it at the LHC.</p>
<p>Second, <em>did LHCb rule out supersymmetry</em>? Well, I just told you that&#8217;s impossible, because if supersymmetry exists but <em>natural</em> supersymmetry does not, then superpartners could be far, far, far out of reach of the LHC. But did LHCb rule out <em>natural supersymmetry</em>? No; I&#8217;ve said this twice before, and I&#8217;ll just send you to the links (<a title="Remember That “Blow” to Supersymmetry (And Other Theories)?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/11/16/remember-that-blow-to-supersymmetry-and-other-theories/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a title="A Couple of Rare Events" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/07/31/a-few-stories-worth-a-comment/" target="_blank">here</a>). What has actually come close to ruling out natural supersymmetry (but we&#8217;re not quite there yet) are the results of the searches for superpartner particles done at ATLAS and CMS. LHCb is just trying to steal their thunder, but their claims in the press are bombastic at best and inaccurate at worst.</p>
<p>Still, even if LHCb, ATLAS and CMS together ruled out natural supersymmetry definitively (and that won&#8217;t happen til 2016, most likely), that would not rule out supersymmetry (which might exist but not have anything to do with <a title="Naturalness and the Standard Model" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/naturalness/" target="_blank">the naturalness problem of the Standard Model</a>) or string theory (which might not even exhibit supersymmetry in any usual way).</p>
<p>So forget it. <strong>The LHC will not rule out string theory</strong>; it won&#8217;t even come close. The machine is powerful, but not even remotely powerful enough to do this.  It&#8217;s like asking an ameoba to climb Mount Everest.</p>
<p><em>[Note Added for experts regarding making predictions in string theory: In response to complaints by commenter Peter Woit (see discussion below in the comments) let me reiterate the importance of my remark that I was taking string theory <strong>in its vanilla form</strong>.  Keep in mind that quantum field theory <strong>in general</strong> doesn&#8217;t predict how protons scatter or whether they even exist &#8212; you have to choose a <strong>specific</strong> quantum field theory, or at least a <strong>specific class </strong>of such theories, before you can do that.  Similarly, string theory <strong>in general</strong> doesn&#8217;t predict how particles scatter.  But if you choose a <strong>specific</strong> vacuum of string theory, or a <strong>specific class</strong> of such vacua, then you can make predictions.  (Not that we understand string theory well enough yet to understand the different vacua in detail &#8212; another practical problem.)  The `vanilla form&#8217; of string theory is a class of vacua in which the particles of nature are tiny strings that have no very strong forces acting on them.  Tell me we&#8217;re in such a vacuum: then I can make predictions.  In other vacua, I&#8217;d make other predictions.  In any vacuum, predictions can be made, though the answers depend, to a greater or lesser degree, on which vacuum you are in.  Presumably, even if string theory is right, only an interplay between experiment and theory can tell us which vacuum we might be in, just as such an interplay was necessary to tell us which specific quantum field theory to use in particle physics.]</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first day of the <a title="SEARCHing for New Particles on Long Island" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/08/20/searching-for-new-particles-on-long-island/" target="_blank">SEARCH workshop</a> was focused on current and future measurements of the new <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">Higgs particle</a> discovered in 2012. A lot of the issues I&#8217;ve written about before (for instance <a title="From Moriond, Higgs Evidence Piles Up" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/03/08/from-moriond-higgs-evidence-piles-up/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a title="Taking Stock of the “Higgs” (Jan. 2013)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/taking-stock-of-the-higgs-jan-2013/" target="_blank">here</a>) and most of the updates were rather technical, so I won&#8217;t cover them today. But I thought it useful to take a look at what was said by <a title="SEARCH Workshop Panel Discussion on LHC Posted Online" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/05/04/search-workshop-panel-discussion-on-lhc-posted-online/" target="_blank">Raman Sundrum</a> and separately by Nima Arkani-Hamed, whom you&#8217;ve heard about many times (for instance, <a title="SEARCH Workshop Panel Discussion on LHC Posted Online" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/05/04/search-workshop-panel-discussion-on-lhc-posted-online/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a title="5. Supersymmetry?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/taking-stock-of-the-higgs-jan-2013/5-supersymmetry/" target="_blank">here</a>), on the subject of the <a title="The Hierarchy Problem" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/" target="_blank">hierarchy problem</a> and &#8220;naturalness&#8221;.</p>
<p>First, let me remind you of the issue. The hierarchy problem can be phrased in many ways. <a title="The Hierarchy Problem" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/" target="_blank">Here&#8217;s one</a>. Here&#8217;s another: for a <a title="The Standard Model Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/" target="_blank">Standard Model Higgs</a> (the simplest possible type of Higgs particle) to show up, without any other new particles or forces at the Large Hadron Collider, is &#8230; well, let&#8217;s say it&#8217;s completely shocking, with a caveat. Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>Because every spin-zero particle (or particle-like object) that has ever been observed, in particle physics and in similar contexts within solids and fluids, has been accompanied by new phenomena at an energy scale comparable to the scalar&#8217;s mass-energy (E=mc<sup>2</sup> energy).</li>
<li>And although we cannot calculate the mass of the Higgs particle using the Standard Model (the equations we use to predict the behavior of the known particles and forces) &#8212; the Higgs particle&#8217;s mass is something we put <strong>in</strong> to the equations, which is why we didn&#8217;t know, before the LHC, what it would be &#8212; there are many speculative theories that go beyond the Standard Model where the Higgs particle&#8217;s mass <em>can</em> be computed, or at least estimated. And in all of these cases, the Higgs particle is accompanied by other particles and forces that show up at scales comparable to the Higgs particle&#8217;s mass-energy.</li>
</ul>
<p>This fact &#8212; that spin-zero particles like the Higgs are accompanied by other particles and forces at a similar energy range &#8212; isn&#8217;t a mystery. Particle physicists (and others who use quantum field theory, the type of math used in the Standard Model) understand <em>why</em> this should be true, and have for several decades. The jargon is that it is &#8220;<strong>natural</strong>&#8221; (not meaning &#8220;from nature&#8221;, but rather meaning &#8220;generically true&#8221;) for spin-zero particles to have other particles and forces around at comparable energy scales. (I&#8217;ll explain the argument another time.)</p>
<p>So to discover the Higgs particle at a mass-energy of 125 GeV, and no other new particles or phenomena below, say, 1000-2000 GeV or so, would fly in the face of what we&#8217;ve seen again and again in physics, both in past data and in calculations within speculative theories. In this sense, <em>finding nothing except a Standard Model Higgs at the LHC would be shocking</em>. (I say &#8220;would be&#8221; rather than &#8220;is&#8221; because the LHC is still young, and no overarching conclusions can yet be drawn from its current data.)</p>
<p>But &#8212; here&#8217;s the caveat &#8212; how bad is this shock? After all, <em>somewhat</em> surprising things do happen in nature all the time. Only astonishingly, <em>spectacularly</em> surprising things are very rare. Yes, it would be a very big shock if new particles and forces associated with the Higgs have a mass-energy a trillion trillion times higher than that of the Higgs. But what if they&#8217;re just a <em>few</em> times higher than would be natural, let&#8217;s say at 10,000 GeV &#8212; which would be out of reach of the LHC? Maybe that is a small enough shock that we shouldn&#8217;t pay it much attention.  Unfortunately, this is a judgment call; there&#8217;s no sharp answer to this question.</p>

<p>As Sundrum put it, there are (crudely) three logically distinct possibilities for what lies ahead:</p>
<ul>
<li>No shock: The hierarchy problem is resolved naturally; the associated new particles will soon be seen at the LHC.</li>
<li>Mild shock: The hierarchy problem is resolved in a <em>roughly</em> natural way; most of the associated new particles will be a bit beyond the reach of the LHC, but perhaps one or more will be lightweight enough to be discovered during the lifetime of the LHC.</li>
<li>Severe shock: The hierarchy problem is not resolved naturally; any associated particles may lie far out of reach, though of course other particles (associated, say, with dark matter) might still show up at the LHC.</li>
</ul>
<p>Arkani-Hamed made a similar distinction, but addressed the third case in more detail, breaking it up into two sub-cases.</p>
<ul>
<li>The solution to the hierarchy problem is that it results from a <em>bias (= selection effect = a form of the &#8220;anthropic principle&#8221;) </em>; the universe is huge, complex and diverse, with particles and forces that differ from place to place [sometimes called a &#8220;multiverse&#8221;], and most of that universe is inhospitable to life of any sort; the reason we live in an unusual part of that universe, with a lightweight unaccompanied scalar particle, is because this happens to be the only place (or one of very few places) that life could have evolved. A key test of this argument is to show that if the particles and forces of nature were much different from what we find them in our part of the universe, then our environment would become completely inhospitable &#8212; perhaps there would be no atoms, or no stars. It is controversial whether this test has been passed; good arguments can be made on both sides.</li>
<li>The solution to the hierarchy problem involves <em>a completely novel mechanism</em>.   Easy to say &#8212; but got any ideas?  Arkani-Hamed gave us two examples of mechanisms which he had studied that he couldn&#8217;t make work &#8212; but perhaps someone else can do better.  One is based on trying to apply notions related to <a href="http://www.nld.ds.mpg.de/~soc/examples.php" target="_blank">self-organized criticality</a>, but he was never able to make much progress.  Another is based on <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep--th/9506101.pdf" target="_blank">an idea of Ed Witten&#8217;s</a> that perhaps our world is best understood as one that
<ol>
<li>has two dimensions of space (not the obvious three)</li>
<li>is <a title="Supersymmetry — What Is It?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/supersymmetry-what-is-it/" target="_blank">supersymmetric</a> (which seems impossible, but in three dimensions supersymmetry and gravity together imply that particles and their superpartner particles need not have equal masses)</li>
<li>has extremely <a title="What is the “Strength” of a Force?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/05/31/what-is-the-strength-of-a-force/" target="_blank">strong forces</a></li>
</ol>
<p>All of this seems completely contradictory with what we observe in our world. But! One of the important conceptual lessons from string theory <em>[this is yet another example of something important that would not have been learned if people hadn&#8217;t actually been studying string theory]</em> is that when forces become very strong, making the physics extremely complicated to describe, it is possible that a better description of that world becomes available &#8212; and that in some special cases, this better description has <em>one additional dimension of space</em> and <em>weaker forces</em>. In short, Witten&#8217;s idea is that our way of understanding our world, with three spatial dimensions, no apparent superymmetry and no extremely strong forces, might actually be simply an alternative and simpler description of a supersymmetric world with only two spatial dimensions with an extremely strong force. Arkani-Hamed, trying to apply this to the hierarchy problem, noticed this idea makes a prediction, but he showed that the prediction is false in the Standard Model, and it seems impossible to add any collection of particles that would make it true.</p>
