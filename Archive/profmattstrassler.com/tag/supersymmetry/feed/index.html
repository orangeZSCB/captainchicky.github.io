					<description><![CDATA[In the long and careful process of restarting the Large Hadron Collider [LHC] after its two-year nap for upgrades and repairs, another milestone has been reached: protons have once again collided inside the LHC&#8217;s experimental detectors (named ATLAS, CMS, LHCb and &#8230; <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2015/05/06/lhc-starts-collisions-and-a-radio-interview-tonight/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the long and careful process of restarting the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC] after its two-year nap for upgrades and repairs, another milestone has been reached: <a href="http://home.web.cern.ch/about/updates/2015/05/low-energy-collisions-tune-lhc-experiments">protons have once again collided inside the LHC&#8217;s experimental detectors</a> (named ATLAS, CMS, LHCb and ALICE). This is good news, but don&#8217;t get excited yet. It&#8217;s just one small step. These are collisions at the lowest energy at which the LHC operates (450 GeV per proton, to be compared with the 4000 GeV per proton in 2012 and the 6500 GeV per proton they&#8217;ve already achieved in the last month, though in non-colliding beams.) Also the number of protons in the beams, and the number of collisions per second, is still very, very small compared to what will be needed. So discoveries are not imminent!  Yesterday&#8217;s milestone was just one of the many little tests that are made to assure that the LHC is properly set up and ready for the first full-energy collisions, which should start in about a month.</p>
<p>But since full-energy collisions are on the horizon, why not listen to a radio show about what the LHC will be doing after its restart is complete? Today (Wednesday May 6th), <a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/virtually-speaking-science">Virtually Speaking Science</a>, on which I have appeared a couple of times before, will run a program at 5 pm Pacific time (8 pm Eastern). Science writer Alan Boyle will be interviewing me about the LHC&#8217;s plans for the next few months and the coming years. You can listen live, or listen later once they post it.  <a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/virtually-speaking-science/2015/05/07/alan-boyle-matt-strassler-large-hadron-collider">Here&#8217;s the link for the program.</a></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">On Tuesday I told you I&#8217;d created </span><a style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;" title="Higgs Decays to Unknown Spin-Zero Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/non-standard-decays-of-the-observed-higgs-particle/higgs-decays-to-unknown-spin-zero-particles/" target="_blank">a page summarizing what we know</a><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;"> about </span><span style="color:#993366;"><em style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;">possible Higgs decays to <strong>two new spin-zero particles</strong>, which in turn decay to <strong>quark pairs or lepton pairs</strong> according to our general expectation that heavier particles are preferred in spin-zero-particle decays</em></span><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;"><span style="color:#993366;">.</span> A number of theories (including models with more Higgs particles, certain non-minimal supersymmetric models, some Little Higgs models, and various dark matter models) predict this possibility.</span></p>
<p>Today I&#8217;ve <a title="Higgs Decays to Unknown Spin-Zero Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/non-standard-decays-of-the-observed-higgs-particle/higgs-decays-to-unknown-spin-zero-particles/">added to that page</a> (starting below figure 4) to include <span style="color:#800000;"><em>possible Higgs decays to <strong>two new spin-zero particles</strong> which in turn decay to <strong>gluon or photon pairs</strong>, according to our general expectation that, if the new spin-zero particles don&#8217;t interact very strongly with quarks or leptons, then they will typically decay to the force particles, with a rate roughly related to the strengths of the corresponding forces.</em></span>  While fewer known theories directly predict this possibility compared to the one in the previous paragraph, the ease of looking for Higgs particles decaying to four photons motivates an attempt to do so <strong>in current data</strong>.<em><br />
</em></p>
<p>I have a few other classes of Higgs particle exotic decays to cover, so more articles on this subject will follow shortly!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago, <a title="Our Survey of Exotic Decays of the Higgs is Done" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/12/19/our-survey-of-exotic-higgs-decays-is-done/" target="_blank">I reported on the completion of a large project</a>, with which I&#8217;ve been personally involved, to investigate how particle physicists at the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC] could be searching, <em><strong>not only in the future but even right now</strong></em>, for possible &#8220;Exotic Decays&#8221; of the <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">newly-discovered Higgs particle</a> .</p>
<p>By the term &#8220;exotic decays&#8221; (also called &#8220;non-Standard-Model [<span style="color:#993366;">non-SM</span>] Decays&#8221;), we mean &#8220;decays of this particle that are not expected to occur unless there&#8217;s something missing from the Standard Model <em>(the set of equations we use to describe </em><em><a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the known elementary particles and forces</a> and <a title="The Standard Model Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/" target="_blank">the simplest possible type of Higgs field and its particle</a>)</em>.&#8221;  I&#8217;ve written extensively on this website about this possibility <em>(see <a title="Exotic Decays of the Higgs: A High Priority for 2012" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/01/27/exotic-decays-of-the-higgs-a-high-priority-for-2012/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a title="Lightweight Higgs: A `Sensitive Creature’" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/lightweight-higgs-a-sensitive-creature/" target="_blank">here</a>,  <a title="A Quantitative Addendum to the Sensitive Creature" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/lightweight-higgs-a-sensitive-creature/a-quantitative-addendum-to-the-sensitive-creature/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a title="At the SEARCH Workshop on the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/18/at-the-search-workshop-on-the-lhc/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a title="Latest from the SEARCH Workshop" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/20/latest-from-the-search-workshop/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a title="Exotic Higgs Decays: Making the Case" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/05/30/exotic-higgs-decays-making-the-case/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a title="Data Parking at CMS" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/lhcposts/triggering-advances-in-2012/data-parking-at-cms/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a title="Final Day of SEARCH 2013" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/08/23/final-day-of-search-2013/" target="_blank">here</a>)</em>, though mostly in general terms. In our <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1312.4992" target="_blank">recent paper on Exotic Decays</a>, we have gone into nitty-gritty detail&#8230; the sort of detail only an expert could love.  This week I&#8217;m splitting the difference, providing a detailed and semi-technical overview of the results of our work.  This includes organized lists of some of the decays we&#8217;re most likely to run across, and suggestions regarding the ones most promising to look for (which aren&#8217;t always the most common ones.)</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">Before I begin, let me again mention the twelve young physicists who were co-authors on this work, all of whom are pre-tenure and several of whom are still not professors yet.  </span><em style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;">[ When <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn24798-higgs-boson-could-reveal-deviant-behaviour-in-2014.html" target="_blank">New Scientist reported on our work</a>, they unfortunately didn&#8217;t even mention, much less list, my co-authors.]</em> They are (in alphabetical order): <span style="color:#800000;">David Curtin, Rouven Essig, Stefania Gori, Prerit Jaiswal, Andrey Katz, Tao Liu, Zhen Liu, David McKeen, Jessie Shelton, Ze&#8217;ev Surujon, Brock Tweedie, and Yi-Ming Zhong.</span><span id="more-7247"></span></p>
<p><strong>The Project</strong></p>
<p>With an immense variety of possible exotic decays of the observed Higgs particle, a thorough search poses a severe challenge.  Experimenters at ATLAS and CMS, the two general-purpose experiments at the LHC, have their work cut out for them. But the payoff would also be huge; if any such decay turned up, it would mean a revolutionary discovery of new forces and (almost always) new particles, ones that lie outside the Standard Model, which has stood as the predictive framework for particle physics for nearly 40 years.</p>
<p>Writing a paper that completely covers all the possibilities would have been impossible. We had to choose a more limited goal, and so the decision was to restrict ourselves to</p>
<ul>
<li>decays which do not produce any unknown long-lived particles (except ones that are always completely invisible to the detector);</li>
<li>decays in which the number of observable <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">electrons, muons, taus, photons, quarks, or gluons (or their anti-particles)</a> is at most 4.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s important to realize, then, that <strong><em>we left out a lot</em></strong>. But at least, with these restrictions, we had a finite list of cases (about 20 sub-classes) to consider, and it took us under 200 pages to do so.</p>
<p>Perhaps our most important observations are that:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#ff0000;"><em><strong>Discoveries are still possible with the existing data set.</strong></em></span> CMS and ATLAS could add to our knowledge by looking more carefully at the data they already have, rather than waiting a year or two for more.</li>
<li>Some completed ATLAS and CMS searches for other phenomena, which weren&#8217;t intended for this purpose, nevertheless, according to our estimates, <strong><em>already put interesting and even sometimes stringent limits</em></strong> on non-SM Higgs decays. Of course, dedicated searches would certainly do even better.</li>
<li>There are many opportunities coming when the LHC turns on again in 2015. One of the big challenges is <em><strong>to assure that <a title="The Trigger: Discarding All But the Gold" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/the-trigger-discarding-all-but-the-gold/" target="_blank">the trigger system</a></strong></em>, which faces even greater strain as the LHC collision energy and collision rate increase, <em><strong>can avoid discarding certain types of non-SM Higgs decays</strong></em>. This important issue must be studied <em>this year</em>!</li>
</ul>
<p>Today, I&#8217;ve created <a title="Higgs Decays to Unknown Spin-Zero Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/non-standard-decays-of-the-observed-higgs-particle/higgs-decays-to-unknown-spin-zero-particles/" target="_blank">a page summarizing what we know</a> about <span style="color:#800080;"><em>possible Higgs decays to <strong>two new spin-zero particles</strong>, which in turn decay to quark pairs or lepton pairs according to our general expectation that heavier particles are preferred in spin-zero-particle decays</em></span>. A number of theories (including models with more Higgs particles, certain non-minimal supersymmetric models, some Little Higgs models, and various dark matter models) predict this possibility.</p>
<p>Over the coming week or so, I&#8217;ll be adding more pages with other classes of decays, and pointing you to them as they&#8217;re ready.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Along with two senior postdocs (Andrey Katz of Harvard and Nathaniel Craig of Rutgers) I&#8217;ve been visiting the University of Maryland all week, taking advantage of end-of-academic-term slowdowns to spend a few days just thinking hard, with some very bright and creative colleagues, about the implications of what we have discovered <em>(a <a title="Discovery of the Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-discovery-of-the-higgs/">Higgs particle of mass 125-126 GeV/c²</a>)</em> and have not discovered <em>(any other new particles or unexpected high-energy phenomena)</em> so far at the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC].</p>
<p>The basic questions that face us most squarely are:</p>
<p>Is the <a title="Naturalness and the Standard Model" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/naturalness/" target="_blank">naturalness puzzle</a></p>
<ol>
<li>resolved by a clever mechanism that adds new particles and forces to the ones we know?</li>
<li>resolved by properly interpreting the history of the universe?</li>
<li>nonexistent due to our somehow misreading the lessons of quantum field theory?</li>
<li>altered dramatically by modifying the rules of quantum field theory and gravity altogether?</li>
</ol>
<p>If (1) is true, it&#8217;s possible that a clever new &#8220;mechanism&#8221; is required.  (Old mechanisms that remove or ameliorate the naturalness puzzle include <a title="Supersymmetry — What Is It?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/supersymmetry-what-is-it/" target="_blank">supersymmetry</a>, little Higgs, warped <a title="Extra Dimensions" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/extra-dimensions/" target="_blank">extra dimensions</a>, etc.; all of these are still possible, but if one of them is right, it&#8217;s mildly surprising we&#8217;ve seen no sign of it yet.)  Since the Maryland faculty I&#8217;m talking to (Raman Sundrum, Zakaria Chacko and Kaustubh Agashe) have all been involved in inventing clever new mechanisms in the past (with names like Randall-Sundrum [i.e. warped extra dimensions], Twin Higgs, Folded Supersymmetry, and various forms of Composite Higgs), it&#8217;s a good place to be thinking about this possibility.  There&#8217;s good reason to focus on mechanisms that, unlike most of the known ones, do not lead to new particles that are affected by the strong nuclear force. (The Twin Higgs idea that Chacko invented with Hock-Seng Goh and Roni Harnik is an example.)  The particles predicted by such scenarios could easily have escaped notice so far, and be hiding in LHC data.</p>
<p>Sundrum (some days anyway) thinks the most likely situation is that, just by chance, the universe has turned out to be a <em>little</em> bit unnatural &#8212; not a lot, but enough that the solution to the naturalness puzzle may lie at higher energies outside LHC reach.  That would be unfortunate for particle physicists who are impatient to know the answer&#8230; unless we&#8217;re lucky and a remnant from that higher-energy phenomenon accidentally has ended up at low-energy, low enough that the LHC can reach it.</p>
<p>But perhaps we just haven&#8217;t been creative enough yet to guess the right mechanism, or alter the ones we know of to fit the bill&#8230; and perhaps the clues are already in the LHC&#8217;s data, waiting for us to ask the right question.</p>
<p>I view option (2) as deeply problematic.  On the one hand, there&#8217;s a good argument that the universe might be immense, far larger than the part we can see, with different regions having very different laws of particle physics &#8212; and that the part we live in might appear very &#8220;unnatural&#8221; just because that very same unnatural appearance is <strong><em>required</em></strong> for stars, planets, and life to exist.  To be over-simplistic: if, in the parts of the universe that have no Higgs particle with mass below 700 GeV/c², the physical consequences prevent complex molecules from forming, then it&#8217;s not surprising we live in a place with a Higgs particle below that mass.   <em>[It&#8217;s not so different from saying that the earth is a very unusual place from some points of view &#8212; rocks near stars make up a very small fraction of the universe &#8212; but that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s surprising that we find ourselves in such an unusual location, because a planet is one of the few places that life could evolve.]</em></p>
<p>Such an argument is compelling for the cosmological constant problem.  But it&#8217;s really hard to come up with an argument that a Higgs particle with a very low mass (and corresponding low non-zero masses for the other known particles) is <em>required</em> for life to exist.  Specifically, the mechanism of &#8220;technicolor&#8221; (in which the Higgs field is generated as a composite object through a new, strong force) seems to allow for a habitable universe, but with <strong>no</strong> naturalness puzzle &#8212; so why don&#8217;t we find ourselves in a part of the universe where it&#8217;s technicolor, not a Standard Model-like Higgs, that shows up at the LHC?  Sundrum, formerly a technicolor expert, has thought about this point (with David E. Kaplan), and he agrees this is a significant problem with option (2).</p>
<p>By the way, option (2) is sometimes called the &#8220;anthropic principle&#8221;.  But it&#8217;s neither a principle nor &#8220;anthro-&#8221; (human-) related&#8230; it&#8217;s simply a bias (not in the negative sense of the word, but simply in the sense of something that affects your view of a situation) from the fact that, heck, life can only evolve in places where life can evolve.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">(3) is really hard for me to believe.  The naturalness argument boils down to this:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Quantum fields fluctuate;</li>
<li>Fluctuations carry energy, called &#8220;zero-point energy&#8221;, which can be calculated and is very large;</li>
<li>The energy of the fluctuations of a field depends on the corresponding particle&#8217;s mass;</li>
<li>The particle&#8217;s mass, for the known particles, depends on the Higgs field;</li>
<li>Therefore the energy of empty space depends strongly on the Higgs field</li>
</ul>
<p>Unless one of these five statements is wrong (good luck finding a mistake &#8212; every one of them involves completely basic issues in quantum theory and in the Higgs mechanism for giving masses) then there&#8217;s a naturalness puzzle.  The solution may be simple from a certain point of view, but it won&#8217;t come from just waving the problem away.</p>
<p>(4) I&#8217;d love for this to be the real answer, and maybe it is.  If our understanding of quantum field theory and Einstein&#8217;s gravity leads us to a naturalness problem whose solution should presumably reveal itself at the LHC, and yet nature refuses to show us a solution, then maybe it&#8217;s a naive use of field theory and gravity that&#8217;s at fault. But it may take a very big leap of faith, and insight, to see how to jump off this cliff and yet land on one&#8217;s feet.  Sundrum is well-known as one of the most creative and fearless individuals in our field, especially when it comes to this kind of thing. I&#8217;ve been discussing some radical notions with him, but mostly I&#8217;ve been enjoying hearing his many past insights and ideas&#8230; and about the equations that go with them.   Anyone can speculate, but it&#8217;s the equations (and the predictions, testable at least in principle if not in practice, that you can derive from them) that transform pure speculations into something that deserves the name &#8220;theoretical physics&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<pre><span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>Appro</em><em>priate for Advanced Non-Experts</em></span></pre>
<p><em>[This is the seventh post in a series that begins <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/23/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions/">here</a>.]</em></p>
<p>In <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part 6)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/11/06/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-6/" target="_blank">the last post in this series</a>, I pointed out that there&#8217;s a lot about quantum field theory [the general case] that we don&#8217;t understand.  In particular there are many specific quantum field theories whose behavior we cannot calculate, and others whose existence we&#8217;re only partly sure of, since we can&#8217;t even write down equations for them. And I concluded with the remark that part of the reason we know about this last case is due to &#8220;supersymmetry&#8221;.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the role of supersymmetry here? Most of the time you read about <a title="Supersymmetry — What Is It?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/supersymmetry-what-is-it/" target="_blank">supersymmetry</a> in the press, and on this website, it&#8217;s about the possible role of supersymmetry in addressing <a title="Naturalness and the Standard Model" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/naturalness/" target="_blank">the naturalness problem of the Standard Model</a> [which overlaps with and is almost identical to <a title="The Hierarchy Problem" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/" target="_blank">the hierarchy problem</a>.] But actually (and I speak from personal experience here) one of the most powerful uses of supersymmetry has nothing to do with the naturalness problem at all.</p>
<p>The point is that <em><strong>quantum field theories that have supersymmetry are mathematically simpler than those that don&#8217;t</strong></em>. For certain physical questions &#8212; not all questions, by any means, but for some of the most interesting ones &#8212; it is sometimes possible to solve their equations exactly. And this makes it possible to learn far more about these quantum field theories than about their non-supersymmetric cousins.</p>
<p>Who cares? you might ask. Since supersymmetry isn&#8217;t part of the real world in our experiments, it seems of no use to study supersymmetric quantum field theories.</p>
<p>But that view would be deeply naive. It&#8217;s naive for three reasons.<span id="more-6913"></span></p>
<p>1. Supersymmetric quantum field theories <strong>might</strong> be directly important in the real world. We don&#8217;t know that the world isn&#8217;t supersymmetric at shorter distances and higher energies than we can currently measure. We need to be able to calculate properties of supersymmetric quantum field theories <em><strong>so that we could recognize them for what they are</strong></em>, should experiments someday give us evidence for them.</p>
<p>2. Supersymmetric quantum field theories can give us <strong>analogies</strong> for aspects of the real world that we know about but don&#8217;t understand very well. The imaginary worlds that are described by certain supersymmetric quantum field theories sometimes bear a certain resemblance to the real world. Consequently it is sometimes possible <em><strong>to gain insights into the real world</strong></em> by studying these imaginary worlds&#8230; remembering that our understanding of the Standard Model is imperfect, because of the difficulty of working with its equations.</p>
<p>3. Supersymmetry enables us to discover entirely <strong>new features</strong> of quantum field theory that we did not know about, and that might be true of some non-supersymmetric theories too &#8212; and these too could be part of the real world. Remember the structure and features of the Standard Model, a rather complicated theory with many loose ends, still poses many puzzles for particle physicists. We don&#8217;t understand the number or strengths of the forces; we don&#8217;t understand why the particles come in the number they do and why their masses have the pattern that we observe; and there is the naturalness problem, among others. The imaginary worlds that are described by supersymmetric quantum field theories have a variety of interesting general features. Although supersymmetry was useful in making it possible for us to discover those features, some of those features are probably also true of non-supersymmetric quantum field theories for which we can&#8217;t calculate anything. So any one of these features <em><strong>might be an as-yet unknown aspect of the real world</strong></em>, even if the real world does not have supersymmetry at all.</p>
<p>So let me tell you a little about supersymmetry.</p>
<p><strong>Supersymmetry: Some Basics</strong></p>
<p>In a world with three spatial dimensions like ours, supersymmetric quantum field theory comes in three varieties</p>
<ul>
<li>maximal supersymmetry</li>
<li>half-maximal supersymmetry</li>
<li>minimal supersymmetry</li>
</ul>
<p>Technically these are called N=4, N=2 and N=1 supersymmetry. <em>[There&#8217;s no N=3 because consistency requirements turn it back into N=4. Supergravity can go up to N=8, but that&#8217;s another story. With more or fewer spatial dimensions, the details are different.]  </em>These were discovered in the 1970s.</p>
<p>The more supersymmetry a quantum field theory has, the simpler the required mathematics becomes, and the more things about the quantum field theory that can be calculated. The calculations in question aren&#8217;t done using methods that I&#8217;ve described so far (<a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part 3)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/01/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-3/" target="_blank">successive approximation</a> and <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part 4)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/07/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-4/" target="_blank">computer simulation</a>); they&#8217;re done using fancier mathematics that takes full advantage of the simpler equations. <em>[For non-supersymmetric theories, no known fancy math can be used; we may well need even fancier mathematics that hasn&#8217;t yet been invented, but at this point we&#8217;re almost powerless.]</em></p>
<p>However, the more supersymmetry a quantum field theory has, the more remote it becomes from the real world. As I mentioned, the real world <em>might</em> have minimal supersymmetry, hidden from us but actually present, though so far that hasn&#8217;t been discovered to be the case. It is unlikely (but not impossible) that some form of half-maximal or maximal supersymmetry has a partial, complicated and subtle role to play in the real world, but that&#8217;s a much more complex issue than I want to cover here. Let&#8217;s just say that <em><strong>maximal supersymmetry has no simple and direct possible role in the real world, whereas minimal supersymmetry may perhaps have such a role.</strong></em></p>

<p>Yet maximal and half-maximal supersymmetric quantum field theories have proven very useful in learning about the real world. And they&#8217;ve proven extremely useful in learning about minimal supersymmetric quantum field theories, which in turn (a) <strong>might</strong> be directly relevant in the real world, and (b) have been somewhat useful in learning about non-supersymmetric quantum field theories, which are <em><strong>definitely</strong></em> relevant in the real world.</p>
<p>So what kind of things can we gain from supersymmetry?</p>
<p><strong>Learning Lessons From Supersymmetry</strong></p>
<p>1) <strong><em>Supersymmetry has made it easier to make particle physics predictions in non-supersymmetric theories.</em></strong></p>
<p>In supersymmetric theories, the <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part 3)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/01/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-3/" target="_blank">method of successive approximation</a> (or &#8220;perturbation theory&#8221;, in jargonese) is simpler. It turns out that one of the best ways to do successive approximation in the Standard Model &#8212; a somewhat complicated non-supersymmetric quantum field theory (QFT) &#8212; is</p>
<p>a) do a similar calculation in a maximally supersymmetric QFT<br />
b) do a similar calculation in a minimally supersymmetric QFT<br />
c) do a similar calculation in a simple non-supersymmetric QFT<br />
d) add them up, with appropriate care</p>
<p>More generally, the structure of calculations in non-supersymmetric theories can be broken up into parts that already appear in supersymmetric theories (and these are relatively easy to calculate) and parts that are special to the non-supersymmetric case (which can be studied in the simplest possible contexts.) In short, supersymmetry gives us a useful way of organizing our real-world calculations, so that the simple parts are separated out and done first, and then the small number of hard parts can be focused on.</p>
<p>This is also the logic and strategy behind the now-(in)famous &#8220;amplitu-hedron&#8221; method that received <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/quanta/20130917-a-jewel-at-the-heart-of-quantum-physics/" target="_blank">a very enthusiastic press article</a> recently.  The article was certainly over the top &#8212; and the title, &#8220;A Jewel at the Heart of Physics&#8221;, was a bit misleading. It should have been entitled &#8220;A Jewel at the Heart of <strong>Maximally Supersymmetric</strong> Physics&#8221;, since &#8212; so far &#8212; the details have been most clear for maximal supersymmetric quantum field theories, which have very special features and are far from the real world. But, as I said above, <em>understanding the maximally supersymmetric case can be step one, with minimally supersymmetric theories to come next, and non-supersymmetric ones to come last but not least</em>. So it&#8217;s early days for the amplitu-hedron, and too early to declare joy and rapture as loudly as did the press article about it all, but there is good reason for cautious optimism that these breakthroughs in maximally supersymmetric contexts will affect calculations in the real world within the next decade.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">2) </span><em style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;"><strong>Supersymmetry has taught us that the effective field theory that describes the low-energy and long-distance behavior of a quantum field theory can have features which we&#8217;ve not encountered &#8212; yet &#8212; in the real world.</strong></em></p>
<p>In a previous post I emphasized that in the strong nuclear force, the<a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part 5)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/28/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-5/" target="_blank"> effective field theory for the low-mass hadrons</a> (pions and kaons) is a useful tool, but that its form had to be guessed &#8212; we can&#8217;t, even today, determine the equations for the effective quantum field theory from the quantum field theory of the strong nuclear force. The only way to figure out the right theory is to guess it starting from data. Well, in supersymmetric quantum field theories, using methods developed in the 90s (which in turn were founded on earlier work from the 80s), we often can determine the right effective quantum field theory to a greater or lesser degree, starting with the equations of the original theory! There&#8217;s still often some guesswork involved, but the math often provides the clues we need.</p>
<p>For instance, take <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part 4)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/07/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-4/">the imaginary world that we use for calculation of the strong nuclear force</a>, with three low-mass quarks and eight gluons, carrying three types of color) The supersymmetric version of this world (see Figure 2) has a superpartner particles for the quarks and for the gluons.  And at long-distance and low-energy, it has pion-like and proton-like hadrons, for which an effective quantum field theory can be written down. The power of supersymmetry opens up the door to an understanding of many features of these theories, not just the ones I&#8217;ve mentioned here.</p>

But also, changing the number of quarks and squarks from 3 to 4 or 5 results in major changes to those phenomena.</p></div>
<p>And in the process of learning how to do this, we also learned that quantum field theory can do many things that we didn&#8217;t previously know it could do. The initial wave of major discoveries about this were launched by the work in 1994 of Seiberg and Witten for half-maximal and maximal supersymmetric QFTs, and of Seiberg in minimal supersymmetric QFTs. I can tell you from having been there when it all was happening &#8212; these were heady days, where major insights into what quantum field theory was capable of were appearing every few weeks. [And then string theory got into the act, but that&#8217;s another story.]</p>
<p>For instance, we learned that the low-energy physics of a quantum field theory can involve gluon-like and quark-like particles that are neither some of the quarks and gluons of the original theory, nor made in a simple sense out of the quarks and gluons of the original theory. (This is in contrast to protons of the real world, which we understand as being made directly out of quarks and gluons.) They are, so to speak, &#8220;emergent&#8221;, arising in a complex and subtle way that even today we don&#8217;t entirely understand.  See point (4) below.</p>
<p>By the way, curiously, computer simulations, such as are used for <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part 4)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/07/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-4/">understanding the strong nuclear force,</a> are not useful here! Supersymmetry is a complete disaster for computer simulations; the methods we have for simulating quantum field theories using computers do not work at all in the presence of supersymmetry.  This is a very frustrating situation, but no one, despite years of work (and some very, very clever ideas) has yet crossed this barrier.</p>
<p>3) <em><strong>Study of supersymmetric quantum field theories has taught us that scale-invariant quantum field theories are far more common than we previously thought.</strong></em></p>
<p>Thanks to the work of Seiberg, considerable evidence was obtained in the mid-90s that even for minimal supersymmetry, <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part 2)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/24/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-2/" target="_blank">scale-invariant quantum field theories</a> are very common. (A few such theories were known in the 70s, and more in the 80s, but they weren&#8217;t considered typical.)  For instance, <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part 6)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/11/06/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-6/" target="_blank">I emphasized</a> that we have no idea how a quantum field theory like the real-world strong nuclear force, but with, say, 8 types of low-mass quarks, behaves when the forces become truly strong. Well, the supersymmetric version of this theory &#8212; with gluons and their superpartner particles (gluinos), along with 8 massless types of quarks and their superpartner particles (squarks) &#8212; turns out to be a scale-invariant theory at long distance. The supersymmetric version of <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part 6)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/11/06/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-6/" target="_blank">the theory with a half-sextet and 7 half-quarks</a>, is also scale-invariant, as we learned from Seiberg&#8217;s student Pouliot. Many properties of these theories can be calculated.</p>
<p>Today, thanks to these insights, it is widely believed that even <em>non-supersymmetric</em> scale-invariant quantum field theories are very common. This belief has motivated people to <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part 6)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/11/06/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-6/" target="_blank">study the question using computers</a>, and though the jury is still out, some evidence has already been obtained.</p>
<p>4) <em><strong>Often, two quantum field theories with entirely different fields are actually the same &#8212; sometimes exactly the same, and other times having the same long-distance low-energy behavior.</strong></em></p>
<p>This phenomenon, known often as &#8220;duality&#8221; <em>(but be careful, because the word &#8220;duality&#8221; is heavily over-used, and means different things in different contexts, even within physics)</em>, is one that deserves its own article. But suffice it to say that two (and sometimes more) quantum field theories, with entirely different sets of fields and entirely different equations, can sometimes have identical physical phenomena &#8212; depending on context, this may mean &#8220;exactly identical&#8221; or &#8220;identical only for low-energy and long-distance behavior&#8221;. Famous names associated with these developments, which go back to the 70s but became clear and widespread in the 90s, are Olive, Montonen, Sen, Seiberg, Witten; less famous names include yours truly and many others.</p>

<p>In fact, this is a grand generalization of the notion of <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part 5)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/28/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-5/">effective field theories</a>. An effective field theory is a quantum field theory whose equations may be used to describe the low-energy and long-distance phenomena of another quantum field theory. As occurs in the case of the strong nuclear force, the original theory and the effective field theory may have completely different fields and equations. For the strong nuclear force, <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part 5)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/28/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-5/" target="_blank">the &#8220;original&#8221; theory is the theory of quark and gluon fields; the effective theory is a theory of pion and kaon fields, which describe the hadrons made from quarks and gluons</a>. But the more general notion of duality is somewhat mind-blowing.  Rather than the second set of fields being made out of the first set in the way a house is made from bricks, as for hadrons and quarks, it may happen that neither set of fields is made from the other in any simple-to-describe way.</p>
<p>5) <strong><em>Supersymmetry has allowed us to learn that there are quantum field theories for which no normal-looking equations can be written.</em></strong></p>
<p>While using fancy mathematics to explore the various quantum field theories with half-maximal and minimal supersymmetry, some of my colleagues (initially Philip Argyres and Michael Douglas, but many more followed) came across theories whose properties simply aren&#8217;t consistent with any type of equations that we know how to write down.</p>
<p>Some clever trickery is required to find these things. In supersymmetric contexts, sometimes it is easier to figure out the answers to certain physical questions not by directly solving the equations that we use in quantum field theory but by an indirect route, using fancy math. The answers one obtains in this way suggest that certain quantum field theories that we didn&#8217;t know about not only exist but have properties that are clearly inconsistent with the types of quantum field theory equations that we normally write down. (For example, we learned of quantum field theories whose symmetries could never arise from ordinary quantum field theory equations.) In particular, such theories cannot be even partially specified by what fields they have. This tells us that we&#8217;ve somehow been too narrow-minded, and there must be ways of defining quantum field theories using methods with which we&#8217;re currently unfamiliar.</p>
<p>What we know about this subject may be just the tip of a large proverbial iceberg. We know there are many of these theories, but we may not have identified the majority of them, or understood anything about what makes them special. Although the ones we know about are supersymmetric, there is absolutely no reason to think there aren&#8217;t non-supersymmetric ones too.</p>
<p><strong>A Moral</strong></p>
<p>From this story, I hope you can get some insight into why particle physicists spend a lot of time thinking about imaginary worlds.  First, certain imaginary worlds might actually turn out to be real; second, what happens in an imaginary world may be analogous to, but easier to study than, what happens in the real world; and third, imaginary worlds may reveal phenomena that we never previously thought of and might be relevant for solving real-world puzzles.</p>
<p>The developments of the past 20 years have given us great insight into how quantum field theory works, thanks in large part to what we&#8217;ve been able to learn about supersymmetric theories, which are simpler to understand. It may turn out that supersymmetry has nothing to do with particle physics at the LHC, and the solution to the naturalness problem of the Standard Model. But for understanding how quantum field theory works overall, this is beside the point: supersymmetry <strong>as a tool for studying quantum field theory</strong> is here to stay. As a teacher of quantum field theory, I will say this: <strong><em>anyone wanting to understand quantum field theory fully <span style="color:#ff0000;">must</span> study supersymmetry.</em></strong> It&#8217;s not optional.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have two very different presentations to give this week, on two very similar topics. First I&#8217;m going to the <a href="http://lpc.fnal.gov/" target="_blank">LHC Physics Center</a> [LPC], located at the <a href="http://www.fnal.gov/" target="_blank">Fermilab National Accelerator Laboratory</a>, host of the <a title="The Tevatron Comes to an End" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/09/30/the-tevatron-comes-to-an-end/" target="_blank">now-defunct Tevatron accelerator</a>, the predecessor to the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC]. The LPC is the local hub for the United States wing of the CMS experiment, one of the two general-purpose experiments at the LHC. [CMS, along with ATLAS, is where <a title="A New Era Dawns" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/07/05/a-new-era-dawns/" target="_blank">the Higgs particle was discovered</a>.] The meeting I&#8217;m attending is about <a title="Supersymmetry" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/" target="_blank">supersymmetry</a>, although that&#8217;s just its title, really; many of the talks will have implications that go well beyond that specific subject, exploring more generally what we have and still could search for in the LHC&#8217;s existing and future data.  I&#8217;ll be giving a talk for experts on what we do and don&#8217;t know currently about one class of supersymmetry variants, and what we should be perhaps be trying to do next to cover cases that aren&#8217;t yet well-explored.</p>
<p>Second, I&#8217;ll be going to <a href="http://www.anl.gov/" target="_blank">Argonne National Laboratory</a>, to give a talk for the scientists there, most of whom are not particle physicists, about what we have learned so far about nature from the LHC&#8217;s current data, and what the big puzzles and challenges are for the future.  So that will be a talk for non-expert scientists, which requires a completely different approach.</p>
<p>Both presentations are more-or-less new and will require quite a bit of work on my part, so don&#8217;t be surprised if posts and replies to comments are a little short on details this week&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the weekend, someone said to me, breathlessly, that they&#8217;d read that &#8220;<strong>Results from the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC] have blown string theory out of the water.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><em>Good Heavens!</em> I replied. <em>Who fed you that line of rubbish?!</em></p>
<p>Well, I&#8217;m not sure how this silliness got started, but it&#8217;s completely wrong. Just in case some of you or your friends have heard the same thing, let me explain why it&#8217;s wrong.</p>
<p>First, <strong>a distinction</strong> &#8212; one that is rarely made, especially by the more rabid bloggers, both those who are string lovers and those that are string haters. [Both types mystify me.] <a title="Strings: History, Development, Impact" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/06/strings-history-development-impact/" target="_blank">String theory has several applications</a>, and you need to keep them straight. Let me mention two.</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Application number 1:</strong> this is the one you&#8217;ve heard about. String theory is a <strong>candidate</strong> <em>(and only a <strong>candidate</strong>)</em> for a &#8220;theory of everything&#8221; &#8212; a silly term, if you ask me, for what it really means is &#8220;a theory of all of nature&#8217;s particles, forces and space-time&#8221;. It&#8217;s not a theory of genetics or a theory of cooking or a theory of how to write a good blog post. But it&#8217;s still a pretty cool thing. This is the theory <em>(i.e. a set of consistent equations and methods that describes relativistic quantum strings)</em> that&#8217;s supposed to explain quantum gravity and all of particle physics, and if it succeeded, that would be fantastic.</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#993366;"><strong>Application number 2:</strong> String theory can serve as a <strong>tool</strong>. You can use its <em>mathematics</em>, and/or the <em>physical insights</em> that you can gain by thinking about and calculating how strings behave, to solve or partially solve problems in other subjects. (<a title="From String Theory to the Large Hadron Collider" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/08/15/from-string-theory-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#993366;">Here&#8217;s an example</span></a>.) These subjects include quantum field theory and advanced mathematics, and if you work in these areas, you may really not care much about application number 1. <em><strong>Even if application number 1 were ruled out by data, we&#8217;d still continue to use string theory as a tool.</strong></em></span> <em>Consider this: if you grew up learning that a hammer was a religious idol to be worshipped, and later you decided you didn&#8217;t believe that anymore, would you throw out all your hammers? No. They&#8217;re still useful even if you don&#8217;t worship them.</em></li>
</ol>
<p>BUT: today we <strong>are</strong> talking about <span style="color:#ff0000;">Application Number 1</span>: string theory as a candidate theory of all particles, etc.<span id="more-6648"></span></p>
<p>Now what&#8217;s so silly about this notion that the LHC has ruled out string theory is that<strong> the whole reason a lot of people hate string theory is that it doesn&#8217;t make any testable predictions</strong>! So obviously you can&#8217;t rule it out with current experiments&#8230; that would <em><strong>require</strong></em> testable predictions!</p>
<p><strong>Caution!</strong> <span style="color:#800000;">Do not interpret the above bold-faced statement to mean that string theory as a theory of all particles etc. makes <em>no</em> predictions at all.</span> <em><strong>String theory certainly makes predictions.</strong></em> For instance (taking string theory in its most vanilla form), string theory predicts that all particles are actually tiny strings.  And if you were to take one electron with a motion-energy of a million million million <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/" target="_blank">GeV</a> or more, and take another electron with similar energy but moving in the opposite direction, and slam them into each other, you would find the scattering is governed by the formulas for how relativistic quantum strings bounce off each other.  Specifically,</p>
<ul>
<li>The probability that they would scatter at large angle is extremely small.</li>
<li>The probability that they scatter at a small angle has a bell-shaped distribution centered around zero angle; the width of the bell shrinks as the energy increases.</li>
<li>The overall scattering rate increases with energy.</li>
<li>And since all particles (not just electrons) are strings, if string theory is right, the same results should hold for scattering of any two particles, not just electrons.</li>
</ul>
<p>These features are very different from what you&#8217;d expect if particles had no detectable size or shape.  Also, the formulas are more precise than my words, so these are things you could check in detail, not just qualitatively.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s only one problem: <em>although these predictions would allow definitive test of the theory, the tests can&#8217;t be carried out with current or currently imaginable technology.</em>  In current experiments, the scattering energy is far too low to detect whether the particles of nature are tiny strings, as small as (vanilla) string theory would suggest.  The pattern of scattering we see when two electrons scatter is what you&#8217;d expect if particles had no intrinsic size or shape. In short, <em><strong>we can&#8217;t actually build a particle accelerator capable of </strong></em><strong>testing</strong><em><strong> these predictions</strong></em>; our technology is about a thousand million million times below where it would need to be, so this isn&#8217;t going to happen soon. Nor does nature provide a natural laboratory; cosmic rays aren&#8217;t nearly energetic enough.   <strong>The problem is practical, not one of principle</strong>.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">So why would anyone even think for a moment that string theory was ruled out by the LHC? It apparently comes from the following line of argument.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>String theory predicts <a title="Supersymmetry — What Is It?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/supersymmetry-what-is-it/" target="_blank">supersymmetry</a>.</li>
<li>Supersymmetry has been ruled out by the LHCb experiment at the LHC, so string theory is ruled out too.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Both of these statements are wrong, in multiple ways.</strong></p>
<p>First, <em>does string theory predict supersymmetry</em>? Even if supersymmetry is present in nature, there is nothing in string theory that predicts that supersymmetry lies hidden at the energies that can be accessed by the LHC; i.e., even if there exist <a title="Supersymmetry — What Is It?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/supersymmetry-what-is-it/" target="_blank">superpartner particles</a>, they may be far, far too heavy for the LHC to find.  Furthermore, although supersymmetry is in some subtle ways built deeply into string theory (as we currently understand it), that doesn&#8217;t mean that it shows up in a simple way: it is not necessarily the case that there will be a recognizable <a title="Supersymmetry — What Is It?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/supersymmetry-what-is-it/" target="_blank">superpartner particle</a> for every particle, as traditional supersymmetry predicts.</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The only situation in which we expect supersymmetry to show up at the LHC is if supersymmetry is solving <span style="color:#008000;"><a title="Naturalness and the Standard Model" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/naturalness/" target="_blank">the naturalness problem of the Standard Model</a>,</span> and thus stabilizing <a title="The Hierarchy Problem" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#008000;">the hierarchy between the extreme weakness of gravity and the strengths of the other forces</span></a>.</strong></span>  For short, let&#8217;s call this &#8220;<em><strong>natural supersymmetry</strong></em>&#8221;.  If supersymmetry exists in nature but has nothing to do with the naturalness problem, we don&#8217;t have any reason to expect to find any sign of it at the LHC.</p>
<p>Second, <em>did LHCb rule out supersymmetry</em>? Well, I just told you that&#8217;s impossible, because if supersymmetry exists but <em>natural</em> supersymmetry does not, then superpartners could be far, far, far out of reach of the LHC. But did LHCb rule out <em>natural supersymmetry</em>? No; I&#8217;ve said this twice before, and I&#8217;ll just send you to the links (<a title="Remember That “Blow” to Supersymmetry (And Other Theories)?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/11/16/remember-that-blow-to-supersymmetry-and-other-theories/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a title="A Couple of Rare Events" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/07/31/a-few-stories-worth-a-comment/" target="_blank">here</a>). What has actually come close to ruling out natural supersymmetry (but we&#8217;re not quite there yet) are the results of the searches for superpartner particles done at ATLAS and CMS. LHCb is just trying to steal their thunder, but their claims in the press are bombastic at best and inaccurate at worst.</p>
<p>Still, even if LHCb, ATLAS and CMS together ruled out natural supersymmetry definitively (and that won&#8217;t happen til 2016, most likely), that would not rule out supersymmetry (which might exist but not have anything to do with <a title="Naturalness and the Standard Model" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/naturalness/" target="_blank">the naturalness problem of the Standard Model</a>) or string theory (which might not even exhibit supersymmetry in any usual way).</p>
<p>So forget it. <strong>The LHC will not rule out string theory</strong>; it won&#8217;t even come close. The machine is powerful, but not even remotely powerful enough to do this.  It&#8217;s like asking an ameoba to climb Mount Everest.</p>
<p><em>[Note Added for experts regarding making predictions in string theory: In response to complaints by commenter Peter Woit (see discussion below in the comments) let me reiterate the importance of my remark that I was taking string theory <strong>in its vanilla form</strong>.  Keep in mind that quantum field theory <strong>in general</strong> doesn&#8217;t predict how protons scatter or whether they even exist &#8212; you have to choose a <strong>specific</strong> quantum field theory, or at least a <strong>specific class </strong>of such theories, before you can do that.  Similarly, string theory <strong>in general</strong> doesn&#8217;t predict how particles scatter.  But if you choose a <strong>specific</strong> vacuum of string theory, or a <strong>specific class</strong> of such vacua, then you can make predictions.  (Not that we understand string theory well enough yet to understand the different vacua in detail &#8212; another practical problem.)  The `vanilla form&#8217; of string theory is a class of vacua in which the particles of nature are tiny strings that have no very strong forces acting on them.  Tell me we&#8217;re in such a vacuum: then I can make predictions.  In other vacua, I&#8217;d make other predictions.  In any vacuum, predictions can be made, though the answers depend, to a greater or lesser degree, on which vacuum you are in.  Presumably, even if string theory is right, only an interplay between experiment and theory can tell us which vacuum we might be in, just as such an interplay was necessary to tell us which specific quantum field theory to use in particle physics.]</em></p>
