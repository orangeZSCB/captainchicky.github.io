										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://lhcb-public.web.cern.ch/lhcb-public/">LHCb experiment</a> at the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/">Large Hadron Collider</a> is dedicated mainly to the study of mesons <em>[objects made from a quark of one type, an anti-quark of another type, plus many other particles]</em> that contain <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/">bottom quarks</a> (hence the `b&#8217; in the name).  But it also can be used to study many other things, including mesons containing <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/">charm quarks</a>.</p>
<p>By examining large numbers of mesons that contain a charm quark and an up anti-quark (or a charm anti-quark and an up quark) and studying carefully how they <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/why-do-particles-decay/most-particles-decay-why/">decay</a>, the LHCb experimenters have discovered a new example of violations of <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/c-p-t-and-their-combinations/">the transformations known as CP</a> <em>(C: exchange of particle with anti-particle; P: reflection of the world in a mirror)</em>, of the sort that have been previously seen in mesons containing strange quarks and mesons containing bottom quarks.  Here&#8217;s <a href="https://home.cern/news/press-release/physics/lhcb-sees-new-flavour-matter-antimatter-asymmetry">the press release</a>.</p>
<p>Congratulations to LHCb!  This important addition to our basic knowledge is consistent with expectations; CP violation of roughly this size is predicted by the formulas that make up the Standard Model of Particle Physics.  However, our predictions are very rough in this context; it is sometimes difficult to make accurate calculations <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/protons-and-neutrons/">when the strong nuclear force</a>, which holds mesons (as well as protons and neutrons) together, is involved.  So this is a real coup for LHCb, but not a game-changer for particle physics.  Perhaps, sometime in the future, theorists will learn how to make predictions as precise as LHCb&#8217;s measurement!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This summer there was a blog post from <span class="fn"><a class="g-profile" title="author profile" href="https://plus.google.com/111136225362929878171" rel="author">Sabine Hossenfelder</a></span>  claiming that &#8220;<a href="http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2016/08/the-lhc-nightmare-scenario-has-come-true.html">The LHC `nightmare scenario&#8217; has come true</a>&#8221; &#8212; implying that the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC] has found nothing but a <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/">Standard Model Higgs particle</a> (the simplest possible type), and will find nothing more of great importance. With all due respect for the considerable intelligence and technical ability of the author of that post, I could not disagree more; not only are we not in a nightmare, it isn&#8217;t even night-time yet, and hardly time for sleep or even daydreaming. There&#8217;s a tremendous amount of work to do, and there may be many hidden discoveries yet to be made, lurking in existing LHC data.  Or elsewhere.</p>
<p>I can defend this claim (and have done so as recently as this month; here are <a href="https://indico.bnl.gov/getFile.py/access?contribId=19&amp;sessionId=6&amp;resId=0&amp;materialId=slides&amp;confId=1516">my slides</a>). But there&#8217;s evidence from another quarter that it is far too early for such pessimism.  It has appeared in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06536">a new paper</a> (a preprint, so not yet peer-reviewed) by an experimentalist named Arno Heister, who is evaluating 20-year old data from the experiment known as <a href="https://home.cern/about/experiments/aleph">ALEPH</a>.</p>
<p>In the early 1990s the Large Electron-Positron (LEP) collider at CERN, in the same tunnel that now houses the LHC, produced nearly 4 million Z particles at the center of ALEPH; the Z&#8217;s decayed immediately into other particles, and ALEPH was used to observe those decays.  Of course the data was studied in great detail, and you might think there couldn&#8217;t possibly be anything still left to find in that data, after over 20 years. But a hidden gem wouldn&#8217;t surprise those of us who have worked in this subject for a long time &#8212; especially those of us who have worked on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0604261">hidden valleys</a>. <em>(Hidden Valleys are theories with a set of new forces and low-mass particles, which, because they aren&#8217;t affected by the known forces excepting gravity, interact very weakly with the known particles.  They are also often called &#8220;dark sectors&#8221; if they have something to do with dark matter.)</em></p>
<p>For some reason most experimenters in particle physics don&#8217;t tend to look for things just because they can; they stick to signals that theorists have already predicted. Since hidden valleys only hit the market in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0604261">a 2006 paper I wrote with then-student Kathryn Zurek</a>, long after the experimenters at ALEPH had moved on to other experiments, nobody went back to look in ALEPH or other LEP data for hidden valley phenomena (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1003.0705">with one exception</a>.) I didn&#8217;t expect anyone to ever do so; it&#8217;s a lot of work to dig up and recommission old computer files.</p>
<p>This wouldn&#8217;t have been a problem if the big LHC experiments (ATLAS, CMS and LHCb) had looked extensively for the sorts of particles expected in hidden valleys. ATLAS and CMS especially have many advantages; for instance, the LHC has made over a hundred times more Z particles than LEP ever did. But despite specific proposals for what to look for (and <a href="http://indico.cern.ch/event/46250/">a decade of pleading</a>), only a few limited searches have been carried out, mostly for very long-lived particles, for particles with mass of a few GeV/c² or less, and for particles produced in unexpected Higgs decays. And that means that, yes, hidden physics could certainly still be found in old ALEPH data, and in other old experiments. Kudos to Dr. Heister for taking a look.<span id="more-8706"></span></p>
<p>Now, has he actually <strong>found</strong> something hidden at ALEPH? It&#8217;s far too early to say. Dr. Heister is careful not to make a strong claim: his paper refers to an observed excess, not to the discovery of or even evidence for anything. But his analysis can be interpreted as showing a hint of a new particle (let&#8217;s call it the <strong>V particle</strong>, just to have a name for it) decaying sometimes to a muon and an anti-muon, and probably also sometimes to an electron and an anti-electron, with a rest mass about 1/3 of that of the Z particle &#8212; about 30 <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/">GeV</a>/c². Here&#8217;s one of the plots from his paper, showing the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-invariant-mass/">invariant mass</a> of the muon and anti-muon in Z decays that also have evidence of a bottom quark and a bottom anti-quark (each one giving a <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/jets-the-manifestation-of-quarks-and-gluons/">jet of hadrons</a> that has been &#8220;<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/jets-the-manifestation-of-quarks-and-gluons/b-tagging-identifying-jets-from-bottom-quarks/">b-tagged</a>&#8221;).  There&#8217;s an excess at about 30 GeV.</p>

<p>The simplest physical effect that would produce such a bump is a new particle; indeed this is how the Z particle itself was identified, over three decades ago.</p>
<p>However, the statistical significance of the bump is still only (after <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/08/28/nature-is-full-of-surprises/">look-elsewhere effect</a>) at most 3 standard deviations, according to the paper. So this bump could just be a fluke; we&#8217;ve seen similar ones disappear with more data, for example <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/04/20/dark-matter-now-you-see-it-now-you-dont/">this one</a>. There are also a couple of serious issues that will give experts pause <em>(the width of the bump is surprisingly large; the angular correlations seem consistent with background rather than a new signal; etc.)</em> So the data itself is not enough to convince anyone, including Dr. Heister, though it is certainly interesting.</p>
<p>Conversely it is intriguing that the bump in the plot above is observed in events with bottom quarks. It is common for hidden valleys <em>(including everything from a simple abelian Higgs models to more complex confining models)</em> to contain</p>
<ul>
<li>at least one spin-one particle V (which can decay to muon/anti-muon or electron/positron) and</li>
<li>at least one spin-zero particle S (which can decay to bottom/anti-bottom preferentially, with occasional decays to tau/anti-tau.)</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, in such models, a rare decay such as Z  ⇒ V + S, producing a muon/anti-muon pair plus two bottom quark/anti-quark <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/jets-the-manifestation-of-quarks-and-gluons/">jets</a>, would often be a possibility.*</p>
<p>*<span style="color:#808080;"><em>[In this case the bottom and anti-bottom jets would themselves show a peak in their invariant mass, but unfortunately their distribution in the presence of a candidate V was not shown. One other obvious prediction of such a model is a handful of striking Z ⇒ V + S ⇒ muon/anti-muon + tau/anti-tau events; but the expected number is very small and somewhat model-dependent.]</em></span></p>
<p>Another possibility (also common in hidden valleys) is that the bottom-tagged jets aren&#8217;t actually from real bottom quarks, and are instead fake bottom jets generated by one or two new long-lived hidden valley particles.</p>
<p>But clearly, before anyone gets excited, far more evidence is required. We&#8217;ll need to see similar studies done at one or more of the three other experiments that ran concurrently with ALEPH &#8212; L3, OPAL, and DELPHI. And of course ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb will surely take a look in their own data; for instance, ATLAS and CMS could search for a dilepton resonance in events with at least two bottom-tagged jets, where the whole system of bottom-tagged jets and dileptons has a invariant mass not greater than about 100 GeV/c². <em><span style="color:#ff0000;">[[IMPORTANT NOTE ADDED: It has been pointed out to me (thanks Matt Reece) that there was <a href="http://cds.cern.ch/record/2223864?ln=en">a relevant CMS search</a> from 2015 that had somehow entirely escaped my attention, in which <strong>one</strong> b-tag was required and a di-muon bump was sought between 25 and 60 GeV.  Although not aimed at hidden valleys, it provides one of the few constraints upon them in this mass range.  And at first glance, it seems to disfavor any signal large enough to explain the ALEPH excess.  But there might be subtleties, so let me not draw firm conclusions yet.]]</span></em> They should also look for the V particle in other ways &#8212; perhaps following the methods I&#8217;ve suggested repeatedly (see for example pages 40-45 of <a href="http://indico.cern.ch/event/46250/attachments/950108/1348060/Strassler.LPC1.pdf">this 2008 talk</a>) &#8212; since the V might not only appear in Z particle decays. <em>[That is: look for boosted V&#8217;s; look for V&#8217;s in high-energy events or high missing-energy events; look for V&#8217;s in events with many jets, possibly with bottom-tags; etc.]</em> In any case, if anything like the V particle really exists, several (and perhaps all) of the experiments should see some evidence for it, and in more than just a single context.</p>
<p>Though we should be skeptical that today&#8217;s paper on ALEPH data is the first step toward a major discovery, at minimum it is important for what it indirectly confirms: that searches at the LHC are far from complete, and that discoveries might lie hidden, for example in rare Z decays (and in rare decays of other particles, such as the top quark.) Neither ATLAS, CMS nor LHCb have ever done a search for rare but spectacular Z particle decays, but they certainly could, as they recently did for the Higgs particle; and if Heister&#8217;s excess turns out to be a real signal, they will be seen to have missed a huge opportunity.  So I hope that Heister&#8217;s paper, at a minimum, will encourage the LHC experiments to undertake a broader and more comprehensive program of searches for low-mass particles with very weak interactions.  Otherwise, my own nightmare, in which the diamonds hidden in the rough might remain undetected &#8212; perhaps for decades &#8212; might come true.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greetings from Geneva, and CERN, the laboratory that hosts the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC], where the <a title="A New Era Dawns" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/07/05/a-new-era-dawns/" target="_blank">Higgs particle was found</a> by the physicists at the ATLAS and CMS experiments. Between jet lag, preparing a talk for Wednesday, and talking to many experimental and theoretical particle physicists from morning til night, it will be a pretty exhausting week.</p>
<p>The initial purpose of this trip is to participate in a conference held by the LHCb experiment, entitled &#8220;Implications of LHCb measurements and future prospects.&#8221; Its goal is to bring theoretical particle physicists and LHCb experimenters together, to exchange information about what has been and what can be measured at LHCb.</p>
<p>On this website I&#8217;ve mostly written about ATLAS and CMS, partly because LHCb&#8217;s measurements are often quite subtle to explain, and partly because the Higgs particle search, the highlight of the early stage of the LHC, was really ATLAS&#8217;s and CMS&#8217;s task. But this week&#8217;s activities gives me a nice opportunity to put the focus on this very interesting experiment, which is quite different from ATLAS and CMS both in its design and in its goals, and to explain its important role.</p>
<p>ATLAS and CMS were built as general purpose detectors, whose first goal was to find the Higgs particle and whose second was to find (potentially rare) signs of any other high-energy processes that are not predicted by the Standard Model, the equations we use to describe all <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the known particles and forces of nature</a>. Crudely speaking, ATLAS and CMS are ideal for looking for new phenomena in the 100 to 5000 <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/" target="_blank">GeV</a> energy range (though we won&#8217;t reach the upper end of the range until 2015 and beyond.)</p>
<p>LHCb, by contrast, was built to study in great detail the bottom and charm quarks, and the <a title="What’s a Hadron?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-hadron-as-in-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">hadrons</a> <em>(particles made from quarks, anti-quarks and gluons)</em> that contain them. These quarks and their antiquarks are produced in enormous abundance at the LHC. They and the hadrons that contain them have masses in the 1.5 to 10 GeV/c² range&#8230; not much heavier than <a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/" target="_blank">protons</a>, and much lower than what ATLAS and CMS are geared to study. And this is why LHCb has been making <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/11/16/a-notable-discrepancy-at-the-lhcb-experiment/" target="_blank">crucial high-precision tests</a> of the Standard Model using bottom- and charm-containing hadrons.  (Crucial, but <strong><em>not</em></strong>, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/07/31/a-few-stories-worth-a-comment/" target="_blank">despite repeated claims by the LHCb press office</a>, capable of ruling out <span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;"><a title="Supersymmetry — What Is It?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/supersymmetry-what-is-it/" target="_blank">supersymmetry</a>, which no single measurement can possibly do.)</span></p>
<p>Although this is the rough division of labor among these experiments, it&#8217;s too simplistic to describe the experiments this way. ATLAS and CMS can do quite a lot of physics at the low mass range, and in some measurements can <a title="A Couple of Rare Events" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/07/31/a-few-stories-worth-a-comment/" target="_blank">compete well with LHCb</a>.   Less well-known is that LHCb may be able to do a small but critical set of measurements involving higher energies than is their usual target.</p>
<p>LHCb is very different from ATLAS and CMS in many ways, and the most obvious is its shape. ATLAS and CMS look like giant barrels centered on the location of the proton-proton collisions, and are designed to measure as many particles as possible that are produced in the collision of two protons. LHCb&#8217;s shape is more like a wedge, with one end surrounding the collision point.</p>

ATLAS&#8217;s shape is similar. Right: Cut-away drawing of LHCb, which is shaped something like a wedge, with collisions occurring at one end.</p></div>
<p>This shape only allows it to measure those particle that go in the &#8220;forward&#8221; direction &#8212; close to the direction of one of the proton beams.<em> (&#8220;Backward&#8221; would be near the other beam; the distinction between forward and backward is arbitrary, because the two proton beams have the same properties. &#8220;Central&#8221; would be far from either beam.)</em> Unlike ATLAS and CMS, LHCb is not used to reconstruct the whole collision; many of the particles produced in the collision go into backward or central regions which LHCb can&#8217;t observe.  This has some disadvantages, and in particular put LHCb out of the running for the Higgs discovery. But a significant fraction of the bottom and charm quarks produced in proton-proton collisions go &#8220;forward&#8221; or &#8220;backward&#8221;, so a forward-looking design is fine if it&#8217;s bottom and charm quarks you&#8217;re interested in. And such a design is a lot cheaper, too. It also means that LHCb  is well positioned to make some other measurements where the forward direction is important. I&#8217;ll give you one or two examples later in the week.</p>
<p>To make their measurements of bottom and charm quarks, LHCb makes use of the fact that these quarks decay after about a trillionth of a second (a picosecond) <em>[or longer if, as is commonly the case, there is significant time dilation due to Einstein&#8217;s relativity effects on very fast particles].</em>  This is long enough for them to travel a measurable distance &#8212; typically a millimeter or more. LHCb is designed to make the measurements of charged particles with terrific precision, allowing them to infer a slight difference between the proton-proton collision point, from which most low-energy charged particles will emerge, and the location where some other charged particles may have been produced in the decay of a bottom hadron or some other particle that travels a millimeter or more before decaying. The ability to do precision &#8220;tracking&#8221; of the charged particles makes LHCb sensitive to the presence of any as-yet unknown particles that might be produced and then decay after traveling a small or moderate distance. More on that later in the week.</p>

<p>One other thing to know about LHCb; in order to make their precise measurements possible, and to deal with the fact that they don&#8217;t observe a whole collision, they can&#8217;t afford to have too many collisions going on at once. ATLAS and CMS have been coping with ten to twenty simultaneous proton-proton collisions; this is part of what is known as &#8220;<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/the-trigger-discarding-all-but-the-gold/" target="_blank">pile-up</a>&#8221;. But near LHCb the LHC beams are adjusted so that the number of collisions at LHCb is often limited to just one or two or three simultaneous collisions. This has the downside that the amount of data LHCb collected in 2011 was about 1/5 of what ATLAS and CMS each collected, while for 2012 the number was more like 1/10.  But LHCb can do a number of things to make up for this lower rate; in particular their <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/the-trigger-discarding-all-but-the-gold/" target="_blank">trigger system</a> is more forgiving than that of ATLAS or CMS, so there are certain things they can measure using data of a sort that ATLAS and CMS have no choice but to throw away.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the weekend, someone said to me, breathlessly, that they&#8217;d read that &#8220;<strong>Results from the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC] have blown string theory out of the water.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><em>Good Heavens!</em> I replied. <em>Who fed you that line of rubbish?!</em></p>
<p>Well, I&#8217;m not sure how this silliness got started, but it&#8217;s completely wrong. Just in case some of you or your friends have heard the same thing, let me explain why it&#8217;s wrong.</p>
<p>First, <strong>a distinction</strong> &#8212; one that is rarely made, especially by the more rabid bloggers, both those who are string lovers and those that are string haters. [Both types mystify me.] <a title="Strings: History, Development, Impact" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/06/strings-history-development-impact/" target="_blank">String theory has several applications</a>, and you need to keep them straight. Let me mention two.</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Application number 1:</strong> this is the one you&#8217;ve heard about. String theory is a <strong>candidate</strong> <em>(and only a <strong>candidate</strong>)</em> for a &#8220;theory of everything&#8221; &#8212; a silly term, if you ask me, for what it really means is &#8220;a theory of all of nature&#8217;s particles, forces and space-time&#8221;. It&#8217;s not a theory of genetics or a theory of cooking or a theory of how to write a good blog post. But it&#8217;s still a pretty cool thing. This is the theory <em>(i.e. a set of consistent equations and methods that describes relativistic quantum strings)</em> that&#8217;s supposed to explain quantum gravity and all of particle physics, and if it succeeded, that would be fantastic.</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#993366;"><strong>Application number 2:</strong> String theory can serve as a <strong>tool</strong>. You can use its <em>mathematics</em>, and/or the <em>physical insights</em> that you can gain by thinking about and calculating how strings behave, to solve or partially solve problems in other subjects. (<a title="From String Theory to the Large Hadron Collider" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/08/15/from-string-theory-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#993366;">Here&#8217;s an example</span></a>.) These subjects include quantum field theory and advanced mathematics, and if you work in these areas, you may really not care much about application number 1. <em><strong>Even if application number 1 were ruled out by data, we&#8217;d still continue to use string theory as a tool.</strong></em></span> <em>Consider this: if you grew up learning that a hammer was a religious idol to be worshipped, and later you decided you didn&#8217;t believe that anymore, would you throw out all your hammers? No. They&#8217;re still useful even if you don&#8217;t worship them.</em></li>
</ol>
<p>BUT: today we <strong>are</strong> talking about <span style="color:#ff0000;">Application Number 1</span>: string theory as a candidate theory of all particles, etc.<span id="more-6648"></span></p>
<p>Now what&#8217;s so silly about this notion that the LHC has ruled out string theory is that<strong> the whole reason a lot of people hate string theory is that it doesn&#8217;t make any testable predictions</strong>! So obviously you can&#8217;t rule it out with current experiments&#8230; that would <em><strong>require</strong></em> testable predictions!</p>
<p><strong>Caution!</strong> <span style="color:#800000;">Do not interpret the above bold-faced statement to mean that string theory as a theory of all particles etc. makes <em>no</em> predictions at all.</span> <em><strong>String theory certainly makes predictions.</strong></em> For instance (taking string theory in its most vanilla form), string theory predicts that all particles are actually tiny strings.  And if you were to take one electron with a motion-energy of a million million million <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/" target="_blank">GeV</a> or more, and take another electron with similar energy but moving in the opposite direction, and slam them into each other, you would find the scattering is governed by the formulas for how relativistic quantum strings bounce off each other.  Specifically,</p>
<ul>
<li>The probability that they would scatter at large angle is extremely small.</li>
<li>The probability that they scatter at a small angle has a bell-shaped distribution centered around zero angle; the width of the bell shrinks as the energy increases.</li>
<li>The overall scattering rate increases with energy.</li>
<li>And since all particles (not just electrons) are strings, if string theory is right, the same results should hold for scattering of any two particles, not just electrons.</li>
</ul>
<p>These features are very different from what you&#8217;d expect if particles had no detectable size or shape.  Also, the formulas are more precise than my words, so these are things you could check in detail, not just qualitatively.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s only one problem: <em>although these predictions would allow definitive test of the theory, the tests can&#8217;t be carried out with current or currently imaginable technology.</em>  In current experiments, the scattering energy is far too low to detect whether the particles of nature are tiny strings, as small as (vanilla) string theory would suggest.  The pattern of scattering we see when two electrons scatter is what you&#8217;d expect if particles had no intrinsic size or shape. In short, <em><strong>we can&#8217;t actually build a particle accelerator capable of </strong></em><strong>testing</strong><em><strong> these predictions</strong></em>; our technology is about a thousand million million times below where it would need to be, so this isn&#8217;t going to happen soon. Nor does nature provide a natural laboratory; cosmic rays aren&#8217;t nearly energetic enough.   <strong>The problem is practical, not one of principle</strong>.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">So why would anyone even think for a moment that string theory was ruled out by the LHC? It apparently comes from the following line of argument.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>String theory predicts <a title="Supersymmetry — What Is It?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/supersymmetry-what-is-it/" target="_blank">supersymmetry</a>.</li>
<li>Supersymmetry has been ruled out by the LHCb experiment at the LHC, so string theory is ruled out too.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Both of these statements are wrong, in multiple ways.</strong></p>
<p>First, <em>does string theory predict supersymmetry</em>? Even if supersymmetry is present in nature, there is nothing in string theory that predicts that supersymmetry lies hidden at the energies that can be accessed by the LHC; i.e., even if there exist <a title="Supersymmetry — What Is It?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/supersymmetry-what-is-it/" target="_blank">superpartner particles</a>, they may be far, far too heavy for the LHC to find.  Furthermore, although supersymmetry is in some subtle ways built deeply into string theory (as we currently understand it), that doesn&#8217;t mean that it shows up in a simple way: it is not necessarily the case that there will be a recognizable <a title="Supersymmetry — What Is It?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/supersymmetry-what-is-it/" target="_blank">superpartner particle</a> for every particle, as traditional supersymmetry predicts.</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The only situation in which we expect supersymmetry to show up at the LHC is if supersymmetry is solving <span style="color:#008000;"><a title="Naturalness and the Standard Model" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/naturalness/" target="_blank">the naturalness problem of the Standard Model</a>,</span> and thus stabilizing <a title="The Hierarchy Problem" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#008000;">the hierarchy between the extreme weakness of gravity and the strengths of the other forces</span></a>.</strong></span>  For short, let&#8217;s call this &#8220;<em><strong>natural supersymmetry</strong></em>&#8221;.  If supersymmetry exists in nature but has nothing to do with the naturalness problem, we don&#8217;t have any reason to expect to find any sign of it at the LHC.</p>
<p>Second, <em>did LHCb rule out supersymmetry</em>? Well, I just told you that&#8217;s impossible, because if supersymmetry exists but <em>natural</em> supersymmetry does not, then superpartners could be far, far, far out of reach of the LHC. But did LHCb rule out <em>natural supersymmetry</em>? No; I&#8217;ve said this twice before, and I&#8217;ll just send you to the links (<a title="Remember That “Blow” to Supersymmetry (And Other Theories)?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/11/16/remember-that-blow-to-supersymmetry-and-other-theories/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a title="A Couple of Rare Events" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/07/31/a-few-stories-worth-a-comment/" target="_blank">here</a>). What has actually come close to ruling out natural supersymmetry (but we&#8217;re not quite there yet) are the results of the searches for superpartner particles done at ATLAS and CMS. LHCb is just trying to steal their thunder, but their claims in the press are bombastic at best and inaccurate at worst.</p>
<p>Still, even if LHCb, ATLAS and CMS together ruled out natural supersymmetry definitively (and that won&#8217;t happen til 2016, most likely), that would not rule out supersymmetry (which might exist but not have anything to do with <a title="Naturalness and the Standard Model" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/naturalness/" target="_blank">the naturalness problem of the Standard Model</a>) or string theory (which might not even exhibit supersymmetry in any usual way).</p>
<p>So forget it. <strong>The LHC will not rule out string theory</strong>; it won&#8217;t even come close. The machine is powerful, but not even remotely powerful enough to do this.  It&#8217;s like asking an ameoba to climb Mount Everest.</p>
<p><em>[Note Added for experts regarding making predictions in string theory: In response to complaints by commenter Peter Woit (see discussion below in the comments) let me reiterate the importance of my remark that I was taking string theory <strong>in its vanilla form</strong>.  Keep in mind that quantum field theory <strong>in general</strong> doesn&#8217;t predict how protons scatter or whether they even exist &#8212; you have to choose a <strong>specific</strong> quantum field theory, or at least a <strong>specific class </strong>of such theories, before you can do that.  Similarly, string theory <strong>in general</strong> doesn&#8217;t predict how particles scatter.  But if you choose a <strong>specific</strong> vacuum of string theory, or a <strong>specific class</strong> of such vacua, then you can make predictions.  (Not that we understand string theory well enough yet to understand the different vacua in detail &#8212; another practical problem.)  The `vanilla form&#8217; of string theory is a class of vacua in which the particles of nature are tiny strings that have no very strong forces acting on them.  Tell me we&#8217;re in such a vacuum: then I can make predictions.  In other vacua, I&#8217;d make other predictions.  In any vacuum, predictions can be made, though the answers depend, to a greater or lesser degree, on which vacuum you are in.  Presumably, even if string theory is right, only an interplay between experiment and theory can tell us which vacuum we might be in, just as such an interplay was necessary to tell us which specific quantum field theory to use in particle physics.]</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my last post, I promised you some comments on a couple of other news stories you may have seen. &nbsp;Promise kept! see below.</p>
<p>But before I go there, I should mention (after questions from readers) an important distinction. &nbsp;<a title="A Couple of Rare&nbsp;Events" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/07/31/a-few-stories-worth-a-comment/" target="_blank">Wednesday&#8217;s post</a> was about the simple process by which a B<sub>s</sub> meson (a hadron containing a bottom quark and a <del datetime="2013-08-02T16:25:46+00:00">down</del><em>[typo]</em> strange anti-quark, or vice versa, along with the usual crowd of gluons and quark/antiquark pairs) decays to a muon and an anti-muon. &nbsp;The data currently shows nothing out of the ordinary there. &nbsp;This is not to be confused with another story, loosely related but with crucially different details. There are some apparent discrepancies (as much as 3.7 standard deviations, but only 2.8 after accounting for the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/12/07/about-those-rumors-that-the-higgs-has-been-discovered/" target="_blank">look-elsewhere effect</a>) cropping up in details of the intricate process by which a B<sub>d</sub> meson (a hadron containing a bottom quark and a down antiquark, or vice versa, plus the usual crowd) decays to a muon, an anti-muon, <strong>and</strong>&nbsp;a spin-one Kaon (a hadron containing a strange quark and a down anti-quark, or vice versa, plus the usual crowd). The measurements made by the LHCb experiment at the Large Hadron Collider disagree, in some but not all features, with the (technically difficult) predictions made using the Standard Model (the equations used to describe&nbsp;<a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary&nbsp;Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the known particles and forces</a>.)</p>

<p>A few theorists have even gone so far as to claim this discrepancy is clearly a new phenomenon &#8212; the end of the Standard Model&#8217;s hegemony &#8212; and have gotten <a href="http://phys.org/news/2013-07-experimental-physics-standard.html" target="_blank">some press people to write&nbsp;(very poorly and inaccurately)&nbsp;about their claim</a>. &nbsp;Well, aside from the fact that every year we see several 3 standard deviation discrepancies turn out to be nothing,&nbsp;let&#8217;s remember to be cautious when a few scientists try to convince journalists before they&#8217;ve convinced their colleagues&#8230; <span style="color:#999999;">(remember <a href="http://www.physicscentral.com/buzz/blog/index.cfm?postid=1500951542663504666" target="_blank"><span style="color:#999999;">this example that went nowhere?</span></a> &#8230;)</span>&nbsp;And in this case we have them serving as judge and jury as well as press office: these same theorists did the calculation which disagrees with the data. &nbsp;So maybe the Standard Model is wrong, or maybe their calculation is wrong. &nbsp;In any case, you certainly musn&#8217;t believe the news article as currently written, because it has so many misleading statements and overstatements as to be completely beyond repair. [For one thing, it&#8217;s a case study in how to misuse the word &#8220;prove&#8221;.] I&#8217;ll try to get you the real story, but I have to study the data and the various Standard Model predictions more carefully first before I can do that with complete confidence.</p>
<p>Ok, back to the promised comments: on twists and turns for neutrinos and for muons&#8230; &nbsp;<span id="more-6398"></span></p>
<p>Another measurement which has gone from <em>strong evidence</em> to an <em>official discovery</em> is the process by which muon-type neutrinos, traveling about 300 hundred kilometers (180 miles) through the Earth, turn into [&#8220;oscillate into&#8221;] electron-type neutrinos. [Click here for a <a title="Neutrino Types and Neutrino&nbsp;Oscillations" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/neutrino-types-and-neutrino-oscillations/" target="_blank">discussion of neutrino oscillations</a>, and a discussion of <a title="How to Make a Neutrino&nbsp;Beam" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/09/23/how-to-make-a-neutrino-beam/" target="_blank">how beams of muon neutrinos are made</a>, and a discussion of <a title="How to Detect&nbsp;Neutrinos" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/09/25/how-to-detect-neutrinos/" target="_blank">how neutrinos can [with difficulty] be measured</a>.] Actually, the oscillation of electron-type neutrinos into <em>something</em> had already been discovered last year, <a title="A Neutrino Success&nbsp;Story" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/04/09/a-neutrino-success-story/" target="_blank">as I described here</a>. &nbsp;But now the T2K experiment, which also provided the initial evidence for this type of oscillation, has confirmed (by observing the reverse process) that electron neutrinos are oscillating into muon neutrinos (and probably tau neutrinos too); they aren&#8217;t turning into some other, previously unknown type of neutrino-like particle. &nbsp;This is as one would expect if there are only <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary&nbsp;Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the three known neutrinos</a> in nature.</p>
<p>In <strong><span style="color:#993366;">T2K</span></strong>, a beam of mostly muon-type neutrinos is made at Tokai (<strong><span style="color:#993366;">T</span></strong>), at the J-PARC laboratory; the beam is measured at Tokai to check its composition, travels to (<strong><span style="color:#993366;">2</span></strong>) the laboratory in the Kamioka mine (<strong><span style="color:#993366;">K</span></strong>), and is measured in the SuperKamiokande experiment. Comparing the measurements at Tokai and Kamioka, the composition of the beam is determined to have changed; a larger fraction of the neutrinos that collide with an atomic nucleus turn into electrons at Kamioka than do at Tokai, indicating some of the muon neutrinos have changed into electron neutrinos.</p>

<p>The fact that this conversion occurs with a substantial rate is interesting on its own, and has implications for those of us trying to understand why the masses of quarks, charged leptons, and neutrinos form such a strange and difficult-to-understand pattern. Equally important, it will make it easier for experiments to study another property of neutrinos in the future: whether their behavior violates the symmetry CP (which you can read about <a title="C, P, T (And Their&nbsp;Combinations)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/c-p-t-and-their-combinations/" target="_blank">here</a>.) In the long-term, discovery of CP violation in neutrinos could perhaps have implications for understanding how the universe ended up with so much more matter (i.e., <a title="Matter and Energy: A False&nbsp;Dichotomy" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/matter-and-energy-a-false-dichotomy/" target="_blank">in this context</a>, electrons, protons, and neutrons) than anti-matter (i.e., positrons [anti-electrons], anti-protons and anti-neutrons.) Don&#8217;t hold your breath though; this will be a story lasting decades or more.</p>
<p>By the way, as I recently learned, the lab at Tokai is temporarily closed down, along with all of its science, due to a <a href="http://operatingexperience.doe-hss.wikispaces.net/file/view/Radiation+accident+shuts+down+Japan+Proton+Accelerator+Complex+(ACS).pdf" target="_blank">fortunately very small but nevertheless badly-handled radiation accident</a>. This is a case where apparently the lab&#8217;s safety systems were sufficient to contain the problem, but either bad training or bad judgment caused humans to override the system. &nbsp;Tokai was also hit hard during the 2011 earthquake, so it&#8217;s been a rough period for the lab, to say the least.</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>The spectacular <a href="http://www.livescience.com/38465-muon-g-2-electromagnet-arrives-fermilab.html" target="_blank">journey via water and road by a giant electromagnet, 50 feet across</a>, from New York&#8217;s Brookhaven Laboratory, where it was built, to the Fermi Laboratory outside Chicago, where it will be reused, has been widely reported. Of course, almost nobody has reported what the magnet is going to be used for, because, hey, it&#8217;s a bit more complicated and <a href="http://www.pantagraph.com/gallery/news/state-and-regional/photos-magnet-arrives-at-fermilab/collection_7bce2562-f63a-11e2-ad54-0019bb2963f4.html#0" target="_blank">the pictures aren&#8217;t quite as good</a>. I promise an article on this, but the short story is this:</p>
<p>The precise way that a particles of a certain type (electrons, neutrons, muons, etc) respond to electric and to magnetic fields turns out, in some cases, to be a remarkably powerful tool for testing the Standard Model (the equations used to describe all of <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary&nbsp;Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the known particles and forces</a>.) If there are additional particles or forces in nature that we haven&#8217;t discovered yet, it is possible that they will affect these responses in a subtle way, via effects known as &#8220;<a title="Virtual Particles: What are&nbsp;they?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/virtual-particles-what-are-they/" target="_blank">virtual particles</a>&#8221; (i.e., via non-particle-like disturbances in the corresponding as-yet undiscovered fields). These effects, though very small, may sometimes be detectable, if sufficient precision can be obtained both in the experiment that does the measurement and in the theoretical calculation of what is expected within the Standard Model.</p>
<p>The response of electrons to magnetic fields (the electron&#8217;s &#8220;magnetic moment&#8221;) has been measured to better than one part in a million million (1,000,000,000,000) and it agrees with the Standard Model prediction, meaning that nothing unexpected showed up in that measurement. <em>[The magnetic moment is proportional to a quantity called &#8220;g&#8221;, which in the absence of virtual particles would equal 2; the interesting part of the measurement is therefore often called &#8220;g-2&#8221;, pronounced &#8220;gee-minus-2&#8221;.]</em> But the muon, with a mass about <span style="color:#800000;">200</span> times larger than the electron, could in many cases <a href="http://muon-g-2.fnal.gov/2-the-physics-of-g-2.shtml" target="_blank">react to new particles or forces</a> with a strength <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">(200)²</span></strong> times larger, or even more. So measuring the muon&#8217;s magnetic moment to better than one part in a thousand million (1,000,000,000) &#8212; which is what this giant electromagnet <a href="http://www.bnl.gov/bnlweb/pubaf/pr/2001/g-2_backgrounder.htm" target="_blank">was previously</a> and will <a href="http://muon-g-2.fnal.gov/2-the-physics-of-g-2.shtml" target="_blank">in future</a> be used for &#8212; could actually be a more efficient way to discover something new.</p>
<p>These measurements, which don&#8217;t require much energy per muon but do require a huge number of muons, are complementary to the types of measurements done at the LHC, where the colliding protons have as much energy as we can give them. Some types of as yet unknown particles and forces would show up first in the direct searches performed at the LHC, but others would show up first in a precise, indirect measurement, such as &#8220;muon g-2&#8221;. It is this complementarity that explains why particle physicists pursue both types of approaches: extremely high-energy collisions with good precision (the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/09/30/the-tevatron-comes-to-an-end/" target="_blank">Tevatron</a> and the LHC) and extremely high-precision measurements with only moderate energy (muon g-2, and many others). &nbsp;[Interestingly, the bottom meson measurements mentioned at the top of this post are a blend of both; they need the large energy of the LHC to produce the moderate-weight bottom mesons &#8212; which have a <a title="The Two Definitions of “Mass”, And Why I Use Only&nbsp;One" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/more-on-mass/the-two-definitions-of-mass-and-why-i-use-only-one/">mass</a> about five times larger than that of a proton &#8212; in great abundance.]</p>
<p>A challenge for this measurement, which will begin in 2016, is that it isn&#8217;t so easy for theorists to calculate the Standard Model prediction at high enough precision to match what this experiment can do; an apparent discrepancy between the last g-2 measurement and theorists&#8217; calculations was <a href="http://muon-g-2.fnal.gov/1-muon-g-2-collaboration-to-solve-mystery.shtml" target="_blank">a source of widespread, but unresolved, controversy</a> in the previous decade. &nbsp;We&#8217;ll see if the theorists can improve their predictions by as much as the experimentalists will be improving their results.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did you know that another name for Minneapolis, Minnesota is &#8220;Snowmass&#8221;?  Just ask a large number of my colleagues, who are in the midst of a once-every-few-years exercise aimed at <a href="http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/july-2013/scientists-look-ahead-to-next-decades-in-us-physics" target="_blank">figuring out what should be the direction of the U.S. particle physics program</a>.  I quote:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#008000;">The American Physical Society&#8217;s Division of Particles and Fields is pursuing a long-term planning exercise for the high-energy physics community. Its goal is to develop the community&#8217;s long-term physics aspirations. Its narrative will communicate the opportunities for discovery in high-energy physics to the broader scientific community and to the government.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>They are doing so in perhaps the worst of times, when political attacks on science are growing, government cuts to science research are severe, budgets to fund the research programs of particle physicists like me have been chopped by jaw-dropping amounts (think 25% or worse, from last year&#8217;s budget to this year&#8217;s &#8212; you can thank the sequester).. and all this at a moment when the data from the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">Large Hadron Collider</a> and other experiments are not yet able to point us in an obvious direction for our future research program.  Intelligent particle physicists disagree on what to do next, there&#8217;s no easy way to come to consensus, and in any case Congress is likely to ignore anything we suggest.  But at least I hear Minneapolis is lovely in July and August!  This is the first Snowmass workshop that I have missed in a very long time, especially embarrassing since my <a title="Professor Peskin’s Four Slogans: Advice for the 2012 LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/22/professor-peskins-four-slogans-advice-for-the-2012-lhc/" target="_blank">Ph.D. thesis advisor</a> is one of the conveners.  What can I say?  I wish my colleagues well&#8230;!</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">Meanwhile, I&#8217;d like to comment briefly on a few particle physics stories that you&#8217;ve perhaps seen in the press over recent days. I&#8217;ll cover one of them today &#8212; a measurement of a rare process which has now been officially &#8220;discovered&#8221;, though evidence for it was quite strong already last fall &#8212; and address a couple of others later in the week.  After that I&#8217;ll tell you about a couple of other stories that haven&#8217;t made the popular press&#8230;<span id="more-6380"></span></span></p>
<p>First<span style="color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">, an update to an ongoing measurement has allowed the LHCb and CMS experiments at the Large Hadron Collider [LHC] to claim an <strong><em>official discovery</em></strong>, where previously they <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/11/12/first-news-from-kyoto-conference/" target="_blank">had only <strong><em>strong evidence</em></strong></a>.  In question is the long-sought <a title="Why Do Particles Decay?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/why-do-particles-decay/" target="_blank">decay</a> of B<sub>s</sub> mesons (<a title="What’s a Hadron?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-hadron-as-in-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">hadrons</a> containing a bottom quark and strange anti-quark, or vice versa) to a muon and an anti-muon. [I briefly <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/tevatron-news/a-rare-and-interesting-decay-of-a-b-meson/" target="_blank">described this process</a> when an unconfirmed claim of evidence was made some time ago.]  By combining their results and using the full 2011-2012 LHC data, they have officially &#8220;discovered&#8221; it &#8230; i.e., together they have been able to <em>exclude the absence</em> of this decay, at the officially sanctioned level of five standard deviations. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">According to the measurement, about 3 per billion (1,000,000,000) B<sub>s</sub> mesons decay in this fashion.  But note the measurement is still not very precise, as you can see in the figure below &#8212; so let&#8217;s not jump to conclusions. That &#8220;3&#8221; could still be 2 or 4 per billion, or perhaps even 1 or 5 per billion, without surprising anyone. Now, calculations using the Standard Model (the set of equations used to predict the behavior of<a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank"> all known particles and non-gravitational forces</a>) predict that this number would be about 3.5 per billion, give or take. So there is agreement &#8212; <em>rough</em> agreement &#8212; between data and the Standard Model&#8217;s prediction. <strong><em><br />

<p>In the press, however, you&#8217;ll see statements that this new measurement has huge implications for <a title="Supersymmetry — What Is It?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/supersymmetry-what-is-it/">supersymmetry</a> (a popular but certainly not unique speculative idea for what might resolve <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/" target="_blank">the hierarchy puzzle</a> of the Standard Model), and for other speculative ideas too.<em> [<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-23431797" target="_blank">From the BBC</a>, you&#8217;d often get the impression that particle physics is &#8220;A Battle Between The Standard Model and Supersymmetry&#8221;, as though supersymmetry is the only other game in town and no one has ever had any other interesting speculative ideas about nature. This is, of course, a tad overstated.]</em></p>
<p>Well, what lies behind these press articles is apparently a powerful hype machine operating within LHCb. It is true that this measurement is very important, and has been since it was first studied seriously at the LHC, as presented in late 2011 and early 2012.  But since that time, each step forward has been relatively small; this is no surprise, since to get a major advance you generally need about 10 times as much data as you had before, and that won&#8217;t happen til 2015 or later. Yet somehow, despite small-to-medium steps forward <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/11/12/first-news-from-kyoto-conference/" target="_blank">in November 2012</a> and now in July 2013, the hype machine has managed to convince the BBC and other press organizations that there have been multiple major scientific advances while actually there&#8217;s been only one. You have to admire them (and to wonder why the BBC isn&#8217;t catching on.)</p>
<p>Let me quote some of the purple prose from the <a href="http://www.lhcb.ac.uk/LHCb-UK/Latest_Physics_Highlight.html" target="_blank">LHCb press release</a>: &#8220;<strong><em><span style="color:#ff00ff;">The result is a <span style="color:#ff0000;">stunning success</span> for the Standard Model of particle physics and <span style="color:#333399;">yet another blow</span> for those hoping for signs of new physics from CERN’s Large Hadron Collider (LHC).</span></em></strong>&#8221;  WOW! <em>Whoosh!!</em></p>
<p>Hee-hee&#8230; gosh, if every measurement with a precision of about 30% that agreed with a theoretical prediction had been hailed as a triumph for the theory, there would be a lot of embarrassed scientists around&#8230; a lot of predictions have failed only after much better precision was available. Let&#8217;s see the precision reach 3%; then we can talk about &#8220;stunning&#8221;.  And a &#8220;blow&#8221; to supersymmetry and to other speculative ideas beyond the Standard Model? Didn&#8217;t we <a title="Remember That “Blow” to Supersymmetry (And Other Theories)?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/11/16/remember-that-blow-to-supersymmetry-and-other-theories/">already go through this exact same story last November</a>?  While this measurement rules out a large number of variants of supersymmetry, there are many other variants which it doesn&#8217;t yet touch. And most other speculative ideas in the scientific literature survive this measurement with an even larger fraction of their variants intact.</p>
<p><em>[Many of the speculative ideas that have been discussed by particle physicists predict multiple Higgs particles.  Typically the variants ruled out by this measurement are those in which at least one type of Higgs particle interacts much more strongly with bottom quarks than does <a title="The Standard Model Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/" target="_blank">the single Higgs particle present in the Standard Model</a>.]  </em></p>
<p>In short &#8212; the recent news is a step forward, but not at a level that would justify the hype.  There isn&#8217;t that much of a change from November, and in any case, you typically can&#8217;t rule out any one speculative idea with a single measurement.   Constraints on speculative ideas come from combining many different measurements being made at the LHC, and elsewhere.  So &#8212; let us express our congratulations to LHCb and CMS for their joint discovery, and also, in a way, to LHCb&#8217;s press office for its &#8230; skills &#8230; regarding journalists and other non-experts.</p>
<p><em>[By the way, the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-23431797" target="_blank">BBC article</a> contains an error. &#8220;Scientists have confirmed one of the rarest phenomena of decay in particle physics, found about three times in every billion collisions at the LHCb.&#8221;  No, it&#8217;s not 3 times in every billion <strong><a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/" target="_blank">proton</a>-proton collisions</strong> at LHCb; it&#8217;s 3 out of every billion <strong>B<sub>s</sub> mesons</strong>, which are certainly not produced in every proton-proton collision.]</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I&#8217;m attending the first day of a short workshop of particle theorists and experimentalists at the <a href="http://www.pctp.princeton.edu/pcts/" target="_blank">Princeton Center for Theoretical Science</a>, a sort of &#8220;Where are we now and where are we going?&#8221; meeting. It&#8217;s entitled &#8220;Higgs Physics After Discovery&#8221;, but discussion will surely range more widely.</p>
<p>What, indeed, are the big questions facing particle physics in the short-term, meaning the next few months? Well, here are a few key ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">A <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">Higgs particle</a> of some type has been <a title="Discovery of the Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-discovery-of-the-higgs/" target="_blank">discovered</a> by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC] (with some contributions from the <a title="The Tevatron Comes to an End" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/09/30/the-tevatron-comes-to-an-end/" target="_blank">Tevatron</a> experiments DZero and CDF); is it the simplest possible type of Higgs particle <em>(the &#8220;<a title="The Standard Model Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/" target="_blank">Standard Model Higgs</a>&#8220;)</em> or is it more complex? What data analysis can be done on the LHC&#8217;s data from 2011-2012 to shed more light on this question?</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">More generally, from the LHC&#8217;s huge data set from 2011-2012 &#8212; specifically, from the data analysis that has been done <em>so far</em> &#8212; what <strong><em>precisely</em></strong> have we learned? <em>(It&#8217;s increasingly important to go beyond the rougher estimates that were appropriate last year when the data was still pouring in.)</em> What types of new phenomena have been excluded, and to what extent?</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">What other types of data analysis should be done on the 2011-2012 data, in order to look for other new phenomena that could still be lurking there? <em>(There&#8217;s still a lot to be done on this question!)</em> And what types of work should theoretical particle physicists do to help the experimentalists address this issue?</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">Several experiments from the Tevatron and the LHC, notably the LHCb experiment, have learned that newly measured decays of  certain mesons <em>(<a title="What’s a Hadron?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-hadron-as-in-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">hadrons</a> with equal numbers of quarks and anti-quarks)</em> that contain heavy quarks are roughly consistent with the Standard Model <em>(the equations we use to describe <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the known elementary particles and forces</a>, and a simplest type of Higgs field and Higgs particle.)</em> How do these findings constrain the possibility of other new phenomena?</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">Looking ahead to 2015, when the LHC will begin running again at a higher energy per proton-proton collision, what preparations need to be made? Especially, what needs to be done to refine the <a title="The Trigger: Discarding All But the Gold" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/the-trigger-discarding-all-but-the-gold/" target="_blank">triggering</a> systems at ATLAS, CMS and LHCb, so that the maximum information can be extracted from the new data, and no important information is unnecessarily discarded?</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">Which, if any, of the multiple (but mostly mutually inconsistent) experimental hints of <a title="Dark Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/dark-matter/" target="_blank">dark matter</a> should be taken seriously? Which possibilities do the various dark matter experiments, and the LHC&#8217;s data, actually exclude or favor?</span></li>
</ul>
<p>That might be it for the very near term. There are lots of other questions in the medium- to long-term, among which is the big question of what types of experiments should be done over the next 10 &#8211; 20 years. One challenge is that the LHC&#8217;s data hasn&#8217;t yet given us a clear target other than the Higgs particle itself. An obvious possible experiment to do is to study the Higgs in more detail, using an electron/anti-electron collider &#8212; historically this has been a successful strategy that has been used on almost every new apparently-elementary particle. But there are a lot of other possibilities, including raising the LHC&#8217;s collisions to even higher energy than we&#8217;ll see in 2015, using more powerful magnets currently under development.</p>
<p>If there are other near-term questions I&#8217;ve forgotten about, I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll be reminded at the workshop, and I&#8217;ll add them in.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By almost all measures, the <a href="http://higgs.ph.ed.ac.uk/workshops/higgs-symposium" target="_blank">Higgs Symposium</a> at the University of Edinburgh, as part of the new <a href="https://higgs.ph.ed.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Higgs Centre for Theoretical Physics</a>, was a great success.  The only negative was that Professor Peter Higgs himself had a bad cold this week, and had to cancel his talk, as well as missing the majority of the talks by others.  Obviously all of us in attendance were very disappointed not to hear directly from him, and we wish him a speedy recovery.</p>
<p>Other than this big hole in the schedule, the talks given at the symposium seemed to me to form a coherent summary of where we are right now in our understanding of the <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">Higgs field and particle</a>.  They were full of interesting material, and wonderfully complementary to one another.  This motivates me to try to provide, for non-experts, some future articles on what the conference attendees had to say.  But to write such articles well takes time.  So for now, here&#8217;s the quick version summarizing the last few talks, along the lines of the summaries I wrote (<a title="The Higgs Symposium in Edinburgh" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/01/09/the-higgs-symposium-in-edinburgh/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a title="Day 2 of Higgs Symposium" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/01/10/day-2-of-higgs-symposium/" target="_blank">here</a>) of the earlier talks.  The slides from all the talks are posted <a href="http://higgs.ph.ed.ac.uk/workshops/higgs-symposium" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Here we go: <span id="more-5346"></span></p>
<p>First off on Thursday afternoon was <a href="http://www.ias.edu/people/faculty-and-emeriti/arkani-hamed/" target="_blank">Nima Arkani-Hamed, professor at the Institute for Advanced Study</a>, and co-inventor of the modern versions of the ideas of <a title="How Big Could an Extra Dimension Be?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/extra-dimensions/how-to-look-for-signs-of-extra-dimensions/extra-dimensions-newtons-gravity/" target="_blank">Large Extra Dimensions</a>, Split Supersymmetry, and the Little Higgs.  Arkani-Hamed (whom you can <a title="SEARCH Workshop Panel Discussion on LHC Posted Online" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/05/04/search-workshop-panel-discussion-on-lhc-posted-online/" target="_blank">see in action here</a>) has for the past year been thinking about the challenges to the simplest versions of <a title="Supersymmetry — What Is It?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/supersymmetry-what-is-it/" target="_blank">supersymmetry</a> posed by a Higgs particle with a mass of 125 GeV/c², as <a title="Discovery of the Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-discovery-of-the-higgs/" target="_blank">the newly discovered particle</a> at the Large Hadron Collider [LHC] appears to be.  There are two classes of solutions that he covered.</p>
<ol>
<li>Add new particles and forces not expected in the simplest (&#8220;minimal&#8221;) variants of supersymmetry, such that effects of the new forces directly push up the mass of the Higgs particle.</li>
<li>Relax the requirement that supersymmetry completely solve the <a title="The Hierarchy Problem" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/" target="_blank">hierarchy problem</a> (which means the rest of that problem has to be solved some other way, perhaps by accident or by a selection effect). This would allow some of the superpartner particles predicted by supersymmetry to be heavier than often expected, which in turn moves the Higgs mass upward through subtle quantum effects, due to virtual particles.</li>

<p>The important thing, as Arkani-Hamed emphasized, is that whether or not you like these ideas, both case (1) and case (2) are probably falsifiable (i.e., can be ruled out by LHC data); for example, even in case (2), where fewer particles would be discovered at the LHC than in standard supersymmetry, their properties would be quite striking.</p>
<p>The next speaker was David Kosower, professor at Saclay, France, whom <a title="From String Theory to the Large Hadron Collider" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/08/15/from-string-theory-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">I&#8217;ve mentioned before</a> as one of the members of the BlackHat collaboration.  Kosower explained how a revolution in calculational techniques, drawing on various tricks obtained from quantum field theory, from supersymmetry and from string theory, has taken place recently.  Among the most dramatic applications is making possible many calculations that are necessary for high-quality measurements at the LHC&#8230; calculations that were thought to be far out of reach just a few years ago.  I can&#8217;t emphasize enough how important and how exciting these advances are to those of us who&#8217;d been watching the slow though steady progress of the previous twenty years.  Another application is to understanding the most symmetric and often most instructive of quantum field theories, the so-called N=4 supersymmetric gauge theory, which has many forms of remarkable quantum behavior.  Even though it is by no means the real world, it&#8217;s astonishing how much of relevance to the real world we&#8217;ve learned by studying it.  Someday I&#8217;ll write about it on this website.  One thing that Kosower mentioned was that the new techniques from this seemingly esoteric N=4 supersymmetric theory have been used to improve the understanding of the mathematical results of more general particle physics calculations, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.0454" target="_blank">making it possible to simplify the formulas for production of the Higgs particle significantly</a>.  <em>(As with string theory, supersymmetry is a field of study that gets a lot of naive criticism from some quarters as being irrelevant to physics; but in fact, as this example shows, supersymmetry has been enormously important to particle physics and quantum field theory, often in surprising ways.)</em></p>
<p>The last speaker of the day was <a href="http://sachdev.physics.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Harvard professor Subir Sachdev</a>, who is not a particle physicist at all: he is a condensed matter physicist (and in particular interested in things like metals, insulators, superconductors, superfluids, phase transitions, and the like.)  There&#8217;s a long history of particle physicists and condensed matter physicists teaching each other important lessons about how quantum systems work &#8212; both the Higgs field and the <a title="Jets: The Manifestation of Quarks and Gluons" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/jets-the-manifestation-of-quarks-and-gluons/" target="_blank">confinement of quarks </a>are related to superconductivity &#8212; and Sachdev has for some years been serving a cross-over role.  I hope I describe him fairly as an expert (among other things) in quantum field theory&#8217;s applications in condensed matter.  During the last decade he has been studying the advances that high-energy physicists like me have been making in supersymmetric field theory and in string theory, to see what he can learn for use in condensed matter.  (A substantial number of string theorists have been participating in this effort as well.)</p>
<p>In his talk, Sachdev described a couple of recently uncovered examples of condensed matter systems that can be studied experimentally and theoretically, one of which exhibits something like a Higgs field with a low-mass Higgs particle, and one of which (admittedly in two spatial dimensions) exhibits something like a high-mass, short-lifetime Higgs particle.  These are interesting to see, though I admit I did not detect any lessons for particle physicists&#8230; perhaps I did not fully appreciate them, so take a look for yourself it you&#8217;re an expert.  He concluded his talk with an application to a condensed matter-like problem of the &#8220;AdS/CFT&#8221; correspondence &#8212; specifically, the use of string theory or gravity to solve problems in quantum field theory.  (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1108.1197" target="_blank">Sachdev has reviewed this application of string theory in the recent past; click here.</a>) To make a long story short, some remarkable insights about otherwise uncalculable aspects of the problem have emerged using these AdS/CFT methods.  Perhaps, if luck holds, these insights will be useful in real-life condensed matter systems, but that&#8217;s too early to say.</p>
<p>Friday morning (which was supposed to include the talk by Higgs) only had two talks, one by me and one by <a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/nms/depts/physics/people/academicstaff/ellis.aspx" target="_blank">Professor John Ellis, of King&#8217;s College London and CERN</a>.  Mine was entitled &#8220;Looking Beyond the Standard Model&#8221;, and I started by reminding the audience that the Standard Model (the equations describing all <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the known elementary forces and particles</a>, including the <a title="Discovery of the Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-discovery-of-the-higgs/" target="_blank">newly discovered particle</a>, assuming it is <a title="The Standard Model Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/" target="_blank">the simplest type of Higgs particle</a>) is a self-contained and consistent theory, but is deeply incomplete, as leaves all sorts of basic questions unanswered. (For instance, why the electron has two heavy cousins, the muon and the tau, is not explained, nor is the specific pattern of the matter particles&#8217; masses and decay rates.) We&#8217;re therefore going to have to look beyond the Standard Model <em>someday</em>; we just don&#8217;t know if this will happen soon and rather suddenly (through a discovery of something unexpected at the LHC or elsewhere) or later and gradually (through a thorough, systematic study, lasting at least til 2020, that tells us that &#8212; to the available precision &#8212; the Standard Model&#8217;s equations predict everything observed at the LHC.)</p>
<p>I then focused on the question of what we ought to do during 2013-2014, while the LHC is shut down for repairs and upgrades, to maximize the chances of making a discovery hidden in the data collected in 2011-2012.  What are the most promising measurements to make?   My answer was that we should focus most on Higgs-related phenomena that are not expected in the Standard Model, asking the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the Higgs-like particle ever produced in a fashion not expected in the Standard Model?</li>
<li>Does the Higgs-like particle ever decay in a fashion not expected in the Standard Model?</li>
<li>Are there any other types of Higgs-like particles hiding in the data?</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I talked about what it would mean if the Standard Model, even though it can&#8217;t be the final word for particle physics, is the complete story for physics <strong><em>at the LHC</em></strong>.  The challenge in this case is that it isn&#8217;t entirely obvious which experiments to do next, or even what type of experiments are likely to yield clues, and it is very important to have an open mind and not to take anything for granted.  Perhaps there are relatively inexpensive experiments that might be surprisingly relevant to the question &#8212; but someone has to be clever enough to realize this.  More on this another time.</p>
<p>The last speaker, John Ellis, focused first on the question of how confident we should be that the new particle is a Higgs particle of some type.  (I wrote about this for you <a title="Higgs Discovery: Is it a Higgs?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-discovery-of-the-higgs/higgs-discovery-is-it-a-higgs/" target="_blank">here, back in July, in the early days after the discovery</a>.) His answer was that there is quite a bit of evidence already, and there will be much more learned in the next few months of data analysis.  Something that was new to me and seems rather remarkable is that the process in which a W particle and the new particle are produced together (<a title="Production of the Standard Model Higgs Particle" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/production-of-the-standard-model-higgs-particle/" target="_blank">see here for the standard production processes for Higgs particles</a>) is very sensitive to the spin of the new particle; assuming the particle is produced in this mode with a rate not too far below that expected for a Standard Model Higgs, it would appear that it may be a very powerful way of excluding the hypothesis that the new particle has spin 2.  <em>(All particles can intrinsically and incessantly rotate, a weird effect of quantum mechanics called &#8220;spin&#8221;; a general <a title="Fermions and Bosons" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/fermions-and-bosons/">boson</a> particle can potentially have spin 0, 1, 2, 3, etc., but the Higgs particle specifically must have spin 0 &#8212; i.e., it doesn&#8217;t rotate at all.) </em></p>
<p>Next, Ellis &#8212; one of the world&#8217;s most prominent experts on supersymmetry as a solution to the hierarchy problem &#8212; considered what we have and haven&#8217;t learned about supersymmetry so far at the LHC.  He concurred with others, including me, who disagreed with the LHCb experimentalist, quoted by the BBC reporter back in November, who said that a recent LHCb measurement &#8220;put supersymmetry in the hospital.&#8221;  Aside from the point that this remark <a title="Why Theories Don’t Go Into Hospitals" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/11/14/why-theories-dont-go-into-hospitals/" target="_blank">doesn&#8217;t make any scientific sense</a>, it was factually inaccurate, as Ellis showed (and <a title="Remember That “Blow” to Supersymmetry (And Other Theories)?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/11/16/remember-that-blow-to-supersymmetry-and-other-theories/" target="_blank">I explained to you back then</a>.)  The really powerful constraints on supersymmetry as a complete solution to the hierarchy problem &#8212; which is how most people mean it when talking about finding it at the LHC &#8212; don&#8217;t come from here.  They come from the mass of the observed Higgs particle (which is almost impossible in the simplest variants of supersymmetry, as also discussed by Arkani-Hamed &#8212; see above) and from the lack of any evidence in LHC data of anything amiss with the Standard Model.  In particular, standard searches for superpartner particles have come up empty (though I&#8217;ve warned you about drawing overly strong conclusions until a wider variety of studies are complete).  Ellis took the point of view that the doors are still open, and it is still too early to draw any conclusions about supersymmetry being part of nature at the mass scales accessible to the LHC.</p>
<p>The symposium concluded with a panel discussion that included a number of the speakers and also scientific luminaries Lance Dixon (also <a title="From String Theory to the Large Hadron Collider" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/08/15/from-string-theory-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">part of BlackHat</a>) and <a href="http://cds.cern.ch/record/1406011" target="_blank">Guido Altarelli</a> (a major figure in the field since the 1970s, who among many other things co-obtained the equations that are used in all modern calculations of proton-proton collisions, such as those at the LHC.)  Much of the discussion focused on the question of whether a new particle collider to study the Higgs-like particle (a so-called &#8220;Higgs factory&#8221;) using electron-positron collisions should be proposed soon, and if so, of what type it should be.  The options for such a machine would be a collider in a circular tunnel (like <a href="http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/research/lep-en.html" target="_blank">the LEP collider</a>, which used to be located in what is now the LHC&#8217;s tunnel, but with 25% more energy per collision than the highest collision energy available at LEP) or one in a linear tunnel (technically more difficult and less certain financially, but able to be extended to higher energies eventually.)  Another option is to push for the LHC &#8212; already itself a factory for Higgs particles, having produced 400,000 per experiment this year &#8212; to be upgraded beyond 2020.  The reason such a machine would be desirable has to do with the &#8220;decoupling limit&#8221; described by Howie Haber in his talk <a title="Day 2 of Higgs Symposium" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/01/10/day-2-of-higgs-symposium/" target="_blank">earlier in the week</a>.  However, some serious thought has to go into whether any sort of proposal along these lines is premature.  I don&#8217;t have a clear opinion on this yet; my current focus is on getting all the information we can out of the 2013-2014 data, since a single unexpected discovery would completely change the debate.</p>
<p>So ended the Higgs Symposium.  My thanks and congratulations to the organizers; I am sure most attendees enjoyed it as much as I did!</p>
