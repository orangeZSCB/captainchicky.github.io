										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is beyond belief that not only am I <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2018/02/05/a-brilliant-light-disappears-over-the-horizon-in-memory-of-joe-polchinski/">again writing a post about the premature death of a colleague whom I have known for decades</a>, but that I am doing it about two of them.</p>
<p>Over the past weekend, two of the world&#8217;s most influential and brilliant theoretical high-energy physicists &#8212; Steve Gubser of Princeton University and Ann Nelson of the University of Washington &#8212; fell to their deaths in separate mountain accidents, one in the Alps and one in the Cascades.</p>
<p>Theoretical high energy physics is a small community, and within the United States itself the community is tiny.  Ann and Steve were both justifiably famous and highly respected as exceptionally bright lights in their areas of research. Even for those who had not met them personally, this is a stunning and irreplaceable loss of talent and of knowledge.</p>
<p>But most of us did know them personally.  For me, and for others with a personal connection to them, the news is devastating and tragic. I encountered Steve when he was a student and I was a postdoc in the Princeton area, and later helped bring him into a social group where he met his future wife (a great scientist in her own right, and a friend of mine going back decades).  As for Ann, she was one of my teachers at Stanford in graduate school, then my senior colleague on four long scientific papers, and then my colleague (along with her husband David B. Kaplan) for five years at the University of Washington, where she had the office next to mine. I cannot express what a privilege it always was to work with her, learn from her, and laugh with her.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have the heart or energy right now to write more about this, but I will try to do so at a later time. Right now I join their spouses and families, and my colleagues, in mourning.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<pre><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong><em>For More Advanced Non-Experts</em></strong></span></pre>
<p><em>[This is part 6 of a series, which begins <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and&nbsp;Predictions" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/23/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions/">here</a>.]</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve explained in earlier posts how we can calculate many things in the quantum field theory that is known as the <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary&nbsp;Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">&#8220;Standard Model&#8221; of particle physics</a>, itself an amalgam of three, simpler quantum field theories.</p>
<p>When forces are <a title="The Strengths of the Known&nbsp;Forces" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-forces-of-nature/the-strength-of-the-known-forces/">&#8220;weak&#8221;, in the technical sense</a>, calculations can generally be done by a <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part&nbsp;3)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/01/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-3/" target="_blank">method of successive approximation (called &#8220;perturbation theory&#8221;)</a>. &nbsp;When forces are very &#8220;strong&#8221;, however, this method doesn&#8217;t work. Specifically, for processes involving the strong nuclear force, in which the distances involved are larger than a proton and the energies smaller than the mass-energy of a proton, some other method is needed. &nbsp;(See&nbsp;<a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part&nbsp;5)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/28/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-5/" target="_blank">Figure 1 of Part 5.</a>)</p>
<p>One class of methods involves <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part&nbsp;4)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/07/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-4/" target="_blank">directly simulating, using a computer, the behavior of the quantum field theory equations for the strong nuclear force</a>. More precisely, we simulate in a simplified version of the real world, the imaginary world shown in Figure 1 below, where</p>
<ul>
<li>the weak nuclear force and the electromagnetic force are turned off,</li>
<li>the electron, muon, tau, neutrinos, W, Z and Higgs particles are ignored</li>
<li>the three heavier types of quarks are also ignored</li>
</ul>
<p>(See <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part&nbsp;4)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/07/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-4/" target="_blank">Figure 4 of Part 4</a>&nbsp;for more details.) &nbsp;This makes the calculations a lot simpler. &nbsp;And their results allow us, for instance, to understand why quarks and anti-quarks and gluons form the more complex particles called hadrons, of which protons and neutrons are just a couple of examples. Unfortunately, computer simulations still are nowhere near powerful enough for the calculation of some of the most interesting processes in nature&#8230; and won&#8217;t be for a long time.</p>

<p>Another method I mentioned involves the use of&nbsp;<a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part&nbsp;5)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/28/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-5/" target="_blank">an effective quantum field theory which describes the &#8220;objects&#8221; that the original theory produces at low energy</a>. But that only works if you know what those objects are; in the real world [and the similar imaginary world of Figure 1] we know from experiment that those objects are pions and other low-mass hadrons, but generally we don&#8217;t know what they are.</p>
<p>This brings us to today&#8217;s story. &nbsp;Our success with the Standard Model might give you the impression that we basically understand quantum field theory and how to make predictions using it, with a few exceptions. But this would be far, far from the truth. As far as we can tell, much (if not most) of quantum field theory remains deeply mysterious.<span id="more-6845"></span></p>
<p>Is this merely an academic problem of no interest for the real world? That is partly a question of whether any of these poorly understood quantum field theories actually is playing a role in particle physics&#8230; which is something we may not know until we complete our study of nature many centuries hence. But at a certain level, we already know the answer is &#8220;no, it&#8217;s not academic&#8221;. Theories of a similar type <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and&nbsp;Predictions" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/23/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions/" target="_blank">have a role to play in &nbsp;&#8220;condensed matter&#8221; physics</a>, and if we understood quantum field theory thoroughly, it might allow for a number of the most difficult puzzles in that subject to be resolved.</p>
<p>To illustrate some of the issues, I&#8217;m going to give you some examples of imaginary worlds described by quantum field theories that don&#8217;t appear in the Standard Model, and tell you something of what we do and don&#8217;t know about them.</p>
<p><strong>Modifying the Strong Nuclear Force: Additional Low-Mass Quarks</strong></p>
<p>First, let&#8217;s talk about a case very similar to the imaginary world of&nbsp;Figure 1. &nbsp;The only difference is that instead of having three &#8220;flavors&#8221; of low-mass quarks &#8212; up, down and strange &#8212; imagine a world that has eight. Or seven. &nbsp;Or nine. &nbsp;What happens in such a world? &nbsp;What do the equations of the corresponding quantum field theory predict?</p>

<p>Does this imaginary world behave much like the real world, with proton-like and neutron-like objects, and pion-like objects that become massless when the quarks are massless? Or does this theory have the property that, when the quarks are massless, it is <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part&nbsp;2)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/24/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-2/" target="_blank">scale-invariant, a feature I described in the second post in this series</a>? As the quark masses are reduced to zero, does the proton mass in such a world remain substantial, or does it drop to zero too? Are there other features that are very different from the real world? Is there <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part&nbsp;5)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/28/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-5/" target="_blank">a simple effective quantum field theory</a> that describes how this world behaves at long distances and low energies?</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">We don&#8217;t know.</span></em></strong></p>
<p>We can probably figure this case out, perhaps in the next few years, using computer simulations; armed with recent advances in both computer technology and in simulation techniques,&nbsp;<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1303.7129" target="_blank">people are already trying</a>. We can certainly simulate the case where the quark masses are relatively big, and then, step by step, lower the quark masses. Each step makes the calculation harder and more unstable, but we can gain insights into what is happening as the quark masses go to zero by looking at how the theory changes &#8212; and particular, how the masses of the hadrons change &#8212; when the quark masses are gradually reduced. Some of my friends with very big computers are working hard to figure this out, but despite 15 years of effort, we still don&#8217;t have clear answers&#8230; yet.</p>
<p>More generally, we can consider similar imaginary worlds where the number of colors is any integer N &gt; 1, and where the number of types of quarks (with N colors each) is any integer Q &gt; 0. &nbsp;The equations for all these theories are similar, but their behavior can be quite different. &nbsp;For a large class of these imaginary worlds (typically those with N&gt;3 and Q between about 2N and 4N) almost nothing is known about their behavior. Except for N=2 and 3, there have been (to my knowledge) no attempts to run computer simulations. &nbsp;So an enormous amount remains unknown, though potentially knowable, at least in part.</p>
<p><strong>Modifying the Strong Nuclear Force: A Chiral Theory</strong></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another imaginary world to think about. This one has something a little different. As I <a title="The Known Particles — If The Higgs Field Were&nbsp;Zero" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/the-known-particles-if-the-higgs-field-were-zero/" target="_blank">discussed in this article</a>, quarks (as well as <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary&nbsp;Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">electrons and other matter particles in the Standard Model</a>) are really made from two half-quarks, which I named quark-right and quark-left <em>(the reason for the names is technical)</em>. So we can consider a theory that has seven quarks-left which carry color (and their anti-quarks-right that carry anti-color), and it has a single half-&#8220;sextet&#8221;-right which carries two colors (and an anti-sextet-left that carries two anti-colors.) It&#8217;s not obvious that this makes sense, but&#8230; trust me. This is called a &#8220;chiral&#8221; theory because the objects that carry color aren&#8217;t the mirror image of the things that carry anti-color.</p>

<p>The key feature of such a theory is that these half-quarks and half-sextet particles&nbsp;<em>can&#8217;t be given a mass</em>; to give a mass to a quark-left, you need a quark-right, and similarly a sextet-right needs a sextet-left. And in this world, these partners are missing. So these particles have to remain massless.</p>
<p>How does this imaginary world behave? I don&#8217;t know, and worse, <em><strong>I don&#8217;t know how to find out</strong></em>. At sufficiently low energy and long distance, successive approximation won&#8217;t work in this imaginary world, anymore than it works for the real-world&#8217;s strong nuclear force. And computers can&#8217;t be used to do calculations, because the calculational techniques currently available simply don&#8217;t work when quarks (or other spin-1/2 particles) are massless. And finally, no one knows how to guess a suitable <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part&nbsp;5)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/28/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-5/" target="_blank">effective quantum field theory to describe the long-distance and low-energy behavior</a> of this imaginary world; neither experiment nor computer simulation is available to give us a hint. It&#8217;s not even clear that an effective quantum field theory with nicely behaved equations exists at all. (We&#8217;ll see soon that there are cases where we know no such theory exists.)</p>
<p>In short, even though the equations of this quantum field theory are known and look very similar to the ones that describe the strong nuclear force in the real world, the physical phenomena that result from those equations are a mystery. &nbsp;This is not unusual. <strong><em>For the majority of quantum field theories for which the equations are known, this is the situation!</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>The Generic Situation: Theories with Unknown Equations</strong></p>
<p>And then&#8230; there are the quantum field theories for&nbsp;which we don&#8217;t even know any useful equations, or any way to characterize them by the types of fields and particles that they have. &nbsp;We know (or perhaps suspect) these quantum field theories exist, but our knowledge is indirect, and the standard types of equations used in quantum field theory don&#8217;t work for them.</p>
<p>[For some of these quantum field theories, we do know some relevant equations that could <em>in principle</em>, with careful adjustment, be used. &nbsp;But often these equations are as hard as the ones described in the previous section, for which neither computer simulation nor successive approximation can work, so <em>in practice </em>the careful adjustment can&#8217;t be done, and no calculations are possible.]<em></em><br />
<em></em></p>
<p>How, you may rightly wonder, could we possibly even <em>know</em> that there are quantum field theories for which no useful equations can currently be written down? That is a story I&#8217;ll tell soon. For today, suffice it to say that we have no idea whether this set of theories is a tiny minority of quantum field theories, or the overwhelming majority. There simply aren&#8217;t any techniques to tell us the answer. Indications are that they are very common. &nbsp; Still, without the equations, how can we hope to learn anything about them?</p>
<p>This is one place where <a title="Supersymmetry — What Is&nbsp;It?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/supersymmetry-what-is-it/" target="_blank"><strong><em>supersymmetry</em></strong></a> &#8212; not in its potentially direct real-world application, as a means by which to address <a title="Naturalness and the Standard&nbsp;Model" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/naturalness/" target="_blank">the naturalness problem of the Standard Model</a>, but rather <strong><em>as a tool for studying the properties of otherwise incomprehensible imaginary worlds</em></strong> &#8212; comes into play.</p>
<p><em>To Be Continued&#8230;</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the most prominent theoretical physicists of our time, Professor Joe Polchinski of the University of Santa Barbara, who has made lasting contributions to our understanding of <a href="http://inspirehep.net/record/189574" target="_blank">quantum field theory</a>, of <a href="http://inspirehep.net/record/189012" target="_blank">gravity</a>, and of <a href="http://inspirehep.net/record/400204" target="_blank">string theory</a>, gave a couple of talks at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton this week.  The two presentations manifested a certain amusing (anti-)parallel; the first was on a puzzle that was thought to have been mostly solved 20 years ago, but turns out to have only been partly resolved; the second was related to a puzzle that was thought to have been solved last year, but turns out to have been partly solved over 20 years ago.</p>
<p><em>In the middle of all of this, it was announced that Polchinski was one of several people awarded one of these new-fangled <a href="http://www.fundamentalphysicsprize.org/news/news3" target="_blank">Fundamental Physics Prizes</a> that are getting lots of attention &#8212; specifically, one of the Frontiers Prizes, if you&#8217;re keeping score.  You can read about that elsewhere.  Here we&#8217;ll try to keep our focus on the science.</em><span id="more-5142"></span></p>
<p>Polchinski&#8217;s first talk, on Monday, based on <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1207.3123" target="_blank">work done with Ahmed Almheiri, Don Marolf, and James Sully</a>, addressed a long-standing question regarding the interplay of quantum field theory (the equations we use to describe the behavior of elementary fields and particles) and black holes (objects whose gravity is so strong that even light cannot escape, yet which will evaporate away, by spitting particles off their edges [their &#8220;horizons&#8221;]).  In the 1970s Stephen Hawking, in his work showing that black holes evaporate, <a href="http://inspirehep.net/record/114952?ln=en" target="_blank">argued that quantum mechanics is violated in this process</a>; the information about how the black hole is produced is lost as it evaporates, which is impossible in a standard (&#8220;unitary&#8221;) quantum theory.  But in 1993, <a href="http://inspirehep.net/record/355341" target="_blank">Leonard Susskind, Larus Thorlacius and John Uglum argued</a> that the information is not lost, that there is no problem with quantum mechanics, and that an obvious contradiction is avoided because quantum phenomena as seen by an observer falling into the black hole are different &#8212; <em>complementary</em> &#8212; to those seen by an observer who remains outside and far from the black hole.  &#8220;Complementarity&#8221; was a nice idea, and it was bolstered by discoveries in string theory (<a href="http://inspirehep.net/record/451647" target="_blank">the field theory/string theory [or &#8220;AdS/CFT&#8221;] correspondence</a>) that made it apparent that the evaporation of black holes <strong><em>can</em></strong> be described by quantum mechanics.  This gave strong evidence that Hawking&#8217;s original way of thinking couldn&#8217;t be right, but still, the field theory/string theory correspondence didn&#8217;t really clarify exactly how complementarity would work.  And now it turns out that it doesn&#8217;t quite work as expected, if at all; Polchinski and friends have shown it leads to a paradox that has even puzzled Susskind.  The debate as to what it all means extended for many hours at the IAS, and continued on Tuesday.  Clearly the apparent paradoxes at the nexus of black holes and quantum mechanics will be with us for some time to come.</p>
<p>Polchinski&#8217;s second talk, on Tuesday, addressed a long-standing problem in quantum field theory: whether there exist quantum field theories with a certain special property. Since the answer is &#8220;no&#8221;, I won&#8217;t trouble you with the details.  <em>(For the experts; the question is whether there exist any unitary scale-invariant field theories, in three spatial and one time dimension, that are not also conformally invariant.)</em>  <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.5221" target="_blank">The claim by Polchinski and his co-authors Markus Luty and Riccardo Rattazzi</a> (famous physicists in their own right) is related to an important advance in the field that I <a title="A Day At Stony Brook" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/11/09/a-day-at-stony-brook/" target="_blank">described last year</a>, by Komargodski <em>(another <a href="http://www.fundamentalphysicsprize.org/news/news3" target="_blank">prize winner</a>)</em> and Schwimmer. <em>[Note Added: following a comment below, which I encourage you to read, I am urged to mention Fortin, Grinstein and Stergiou, who <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.3674v1" target="_blank">first claimed to have discovered scale-invariant theories that are not conformally invariant</a>, (going back as far as <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1106.2540" target="_blank">this paper</a>), and then backed off, instead <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.3674v2" target="_blank">claiming only they have discovered conformally invariant theories which have cyclically-varying couplings</a>. There were also changes in the Luty et al. paper in their second version, apparently reflecting ongoing discussion between the two sets of authors.  Both 2nd versions appeared on November 9th. I am unclear if disagreements between the groups remain.]</em>  Among the interesting observations Polchinski made in the talk is that the breakthrough work of Komargodski and Schwimmer was partially presaged by work 20 years ago by Hugh Osborn (also famous), and by <a href="http://inspirehep.net/record/27337" target="_blank">Osborn with Ian Jack</a>.  Osborn seems to have <a href="http://inspirehep.net/record/29410" target="_blank">buried his main result in a long, complex and difficult paper</a> that most people didn&#8217;t understand.  Well, this kind of thing happens sometimes&#8230;  In any case, this earlier work deserves some credit, though there&#8217;s also much to be said for <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1107.3987" target="_blank">Komargodski and Schwimmer&#8217;s argument</a>, which is more widely applicable and, importantly, is much easier to understand both technically and conceptually.</p>
<p>In attendance were a remarkable number of the world&#8217;s experts, along with a healthy number of young experts-in-training.  After the talks they clustered in groups and engaged in lengthy conversations, trying to interpret the more confusing elements.  For me it was a bit like old times; Monday&#8217;s audience included four of my colleagues from my early years as a Rutgers University postdoctoral researcher (in the mid-90s) and many people who were then in Princeton.  I was bemused that the conversations concerning black holes seem as confused and confusing now as they were two decades ago.  Sometimes progress is made in a slowly ascending spiral, requiring a visit to old territory before further advances can be made.</p>
