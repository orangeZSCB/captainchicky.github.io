										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m still kind of exhausted from the effort (<a title="Our Survey of Exotic Decays of the Higgs is Done" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/12/19/our-survey-of-exotic-higgs-decays-is-done/" target="_blank">see yesterday&#8217;s post</a>) of completing our survey of some of the many unexpected ways that the newly discovered <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">Higgs particle</a> might decay. But I would be remiss if, before heading off into the holiday break, I didn&#8217;t issue some well-deserved congratulations.</p>
<div style="width: 309px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img alt="" src="https://i2.wp.com/news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/71757000/jpg/_71757703_020360764-1.jpg" width="299" height="217" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The Jade Rabbit rover on the surface of the Moon, 15 December.

<p>Congratulations, first, to China &#8212; to the scientists and engineers who&#8217;ve managed to put a lander and a rover on the Moon. If you think that&#8217;s easy&#8230; think again! And they succeeded on their first attempt, a real coup. Now let&#8217;s see what science they can do with it, exploring a region of the Moon that apparently may offer answers to important questions about the Moon&#8217;s history. Specifically, by accident or by design, <a href="http://blogs.airspacemag.com/moon/" target="_blank">the rover is going to be able to explore an area of considerable geological importance</a>, involving one of the Moon&#8217;s giant lava flows, a relatively young one (1-2.5 billion years rather than 3 billion or more).</p>
<div style="width: 273px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img alt="" src="https://i2.wp.com/sci.esa.int/science-e-media/img/29/Gaia_liftoff_12_625.jpg" width="263" height="394" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Soyuz VS06, with Gaia, lifted off from Europe&#8217;s Spaceport, French Guiana, on 19 December 2013. Copyright: ESA &#8211; S. Corvaja, 2013</p></div>
<p>Congratulations, next, to the scientists and engineers of the European Union, who&#8217;ve put a fantastic telescope into space, destined to orbit the sun. The Gaia mission is aimed at doing the extraordinary: mapping, with ultra-high precision, the locations and motions of no less than 1 billion stars within our galaxy &#8212; nearly 1% of the total number. The distance to each of these stars will be determined by <a title="Parallax: Seeing in Depth" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/parallax-seeing-in-depth/" target="_blank">parallax</a> &#8212; looking at how the positions of stars wobble, from the perspective of the spacecraft as it orbits the sun &#8212; and the real motions of the stars will be determined by how they drift across the sky, and by the <a href="http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/doppler.htm" target="_blank">Doppler effect</a> for light.  This wealth of information will help scientists figure out the shape and history of the galaxy to a degree never previously possible.  Meanwhile, Gaia will also be able to do a lot of other science, picking up distant supernovas outside our galaxy, nearby asteroids orbiting our sun, and signs of planets around other stars, as well as brown dwarfs (small failed stars) that may be floating around between the stars. Gaia can even check some aspects of Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity! <a href="http://sci.esa.int/gaia/28890-objectives/" target="_blank">Read here</a> about all the wonderful things this mission can do.</p>
<p>Congratulations also to the scientists and engineers in Iran, who&#8217;ve apparently moved their rocketry program, and its potential application to human space flight, among other things, another step forward. A second monkey has made the trip to the edge of space, a suborbital trip. (Did the first survive? it&#8217;s not clear, and admittedly Iran is known for photo-shopping reality into supporting the story it wants to tell. Not that it matters; <a href="http://history.nasa.gov/animals.html" target="_blank">it took the US several tries</a>, back over 60 years ago, before a monkey survived the trip, and the survival rate continued to be poor for a while. )  Anyway, it puts Iran well on its way toward its goal of a human in space by 2018.</p>
<p>And finally, congratulations to my own country, the United States, for having <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/18/us-usa-fiscal-idUSBRE9BF1FW20131218" target="_blank">passed a budget deal.</a> Not out of the woods yet, but at least it was bipartisan, and we&#8217;re not yet talking about <a title="Help! I’m a Hostage! (D – 7)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/10/help-im-a-hostage-d-7/" target="_blank">another damaging government shutdown</a>, or worse, default. Politics isn&#8217;t rocket science. We&#8217;ll have to hope our politicians can learn something from China: that it&#8217;s good to find some common and worthy goals to work toward together, rather than to fight about absolutely everything and bring the nation&#8217;s operations to a halt.</p>
