										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, a small but intrepid band of theoretical particle physicists (professor Jesse Thaler of MIT, postdocs Yotam Soreq and Wei Xue of CERN, Harvard Ph.D. student Cari Cesarotti, and myself) put out <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04222">a paper</a> that is unconventional in two senses. First, we looked for new particles at the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">Large Hadron Collider</a> in a way that hasn&#8217;t been done before, at least in public. And second, we looked for new particles at the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">Large Hadron Collider</a> in a way that hasn&#8217;t been done before, at least in public.</p>
<p>And no, there&#8217;s no error in the previous paragraph.</p>
<p>1) We used a small amount of <strong>actual data from the <a href="https://home.cern/science/experiments/cms">CMS experiment</a></strong>, even though we&#8217;re not ourselves members of the CMS experiment, to do a search for a new particle. Both ATLAS and CMS, the two large multipurpose experimental detectors at the Large Hadron Collider [LHC], have made a small fraction of their proton-proton collision data public, through a website called the <a href="http://opendata.cern.ch/">CERN Open Data Portal</a>. Some experts, including my co-authors Thaler, Xue and their colleagues, have used this data (and the simulations that accompany it) to do a variety of important studies involving known particles and their properties. [Here&#8217;s <a href="http://cylindricalonion.web.cern.ch/blog/201712/future-particle-physics-open">a blog post by Thaler concerning Open Data and its importance from his perspective.</a>] But our new study is the first to <strong><em>look for signs of a new particle in this public data</em></strong>. While our chances of finding anything were low, we had a larger goal: to see whether Open Data could be used for such searches. We hope our paper provides some evidence that Open Data offers a reasonable path for preserving priceless LHC data, allowing it to be used as an archive by physicists of the post-LHC era.</p>
<p>2) Since only had a tiny fraction of CMS&#8217;s data was available to us, about 1% by some count, how could we have done anything useful compared to what the LHC experts have already done? Well, that&#8217;s why we examined the data in a slightly unconventional way (one of <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/94815/contributions/1282671/">several methods that I&#8217;ve advocated for many years</a>, but has not been used in any public study). Consequently it allowed us to explore some ground that no one had yet swept clean, and even have a tiny chance of an actual discovery! But the larger scientific goal, absent a discovery, was <strong>to prove the value of this unconventional strategy</strong>, in hopes that the experts at CMS and ATLAS will use it (and others like it) in future. Their chance of discovering something new, using their full data set, is vastly greater than ours ever was.</p>
<p>Now don&#8217;t all go rushing off to download and analyze terabytes of CMS Open Data; you&#8217;d better know what you&#8217;re getting into first. It&#8217;s worthwhile, but it&#8217;s not easy going. LHC data is extremely complicated, and until this project I&#8217;ve always been skeptical that it could be released in a form that anyone outside the experimental collaborations could use. Downloading the data and turning it into a manageable form is itself a major task. Then, while studying it, there are an enormous number of mistakes that you can make (and we made quite a few of them) and you&#8217;d better know how to make lots of cross-checks to find your mistakes (which, fortunately, we did know; we hope we found all of them!) The CMS personnel in charge of the Open Data project were enormously helpful to us, and we&#8217;re very grateful to them; but since the project is new, there were inevitable wrinkles which had to be worked around. And you&#8217;d better have some friends among the experimentalists who can give you advice when you get stuck, or point out aspects of your results that don&#8217;t look quite right. [Our thanks to them!]</p>
<p>All in all, this project took us two years! Well, honestly, it should have taken half that time &#8212; but it couldn&#8217;t have taken much less than that, with all we had to learn. So trying to use Open Data from an LHC experiment is not something you do in your idle free time.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I feel it was worth it. At a personal level, I learned a great deal more about how experimental analyses are carried out at CMS, and by extension, at the LHC more generally. And more importantly, we were able to show what we&#8217;d hoped to show: that <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em><strong>there are still tremendous opportunities for discovery at the LHC</strong></em></span>, through the use of (even slightly) unconventional model-independent analyses. It&#8217;s a big world to explore, and we took only a small step in the easiest direction, but perhaps our efforts will encourage others to take bigger and more challenging ones.</p>
<p>For those readers with greater interest in our work, I&#8217;ll put out more details in two blog posts over the next few days: one about what we looked for and how, and one about our views regarding the value of open data from the LHC, not only for our project but for the field of particle physics as a whole.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The controversy continues to develop over the interpretation of <a title="BICEP2: New Evidence Of Cosmic Inflation!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/bicep2-new-evidence-of-cosmic-inflation/" target="_blank">the results from BICEP2</a>, the experiment that detected &#8220;B-mode&#8221; polarization in the sky, and was hailed as potential <a title="Did BICEP2 Detect Gravitational Waves Directly or Indirectly?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/04/30/did-bicep2-detect-gravitational-waves-directly-or-indirectly/" target="_blank">evidence of gravitational waves</a> from <a title="History of the Universe" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/" target="_blank">the early universe</a>, presumably generated during <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">cosmic inflation</a>. <em>[<a title="A Primer On Today’s Events" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/a-primer-on-todays-events/">Here&#8217;s some background info about the measurement</a>].</em></p>
<p>Two papers this week (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1405.5857" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.7351" target="_blank">here</a>) gave more detailed voice to <a title="Will BICEP2 Lose Some of Its Muscle?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/05/19/will-bicep2-lose-some-of-its-muscle/" target="_blank">the opinion that the BICEP2 team may have systematically underestimated the possible impact of polarized dust</a> on their measurement.  These papers raise (but cannot settle) the question as to whether the B-mode polarization seen by BICEP2 might be entirely due to this dust &#8212; dust which is found throughout our galaxy, but is rather tenuous in the direction of the sky in which BICEP2 was looking.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to drag my readers into the mud of the current discussion, both because it&#8217;s very technical and because it&#8217;s rather vague and highly speculative. Even the authors of the two papers admit they leave the situation completely unsettled.  But to summarize, the main purpose and effect of these papers seems to be this:</p>
<p><span id="more-7706"></span></p>
<ol>
<li>to point out that the level to which dust tends to be polarized, as measured by <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0871" target="_blank">the Planck satellite team in their very recent paper</a>, is larger than most people expected: twice as large, or more, than assumed by BICEP2 in some of their arguments;</li>
<li>to remind us that the effect of the dust on the BICEP2 polarization signal increases like the <strong><em>square</em></strong> of the dust polarization &#8212; i.e., a <em>doubling</em> of the dust polarization means a <em>quadrupling</em> of the contribution of the dust to BICEP2&#8217;s measurement;</li>
<li>to try to convince us that the uncertainties about dust are currently too large for anyone to draw conclusions as to the meaning of BICEP2&#8217;s measurement &#8212; as to whether it is due to gravitational waves, to polarized dust, or to a combination of the two <em>[along with small effects from synchrotron radiation and from gravitational lensing of E-mode polarization of the cosmic microwave background]</em>;</li>
<li>to note that new measurements relevant for determining the dust effect are on their way on the 6 to 12 month timescale, so these issues may soon be resolved &#8212; although it may not be so easy, because <em>precise</em> determinations of the dust polarization, and proper combination of measurements by different experiments, will be needed for an unambiguous measurement of any gravitational wave contribution to BICEP2&#8217;s B-mode polarization.</li>
</ol>
<p>Regarding the last point, the most important measurements in question will come</p>
<ul>
<li>from the BICEP2 team itself, whose next-generation experiment KECK, already running, is basically five BICEP2&#8217;s in tandem, and will cover two different microwave frequencies, and</li>
<li>from <a title="The Universe According to Planck (The Satellite)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/03/21/the-universe-according-to-planck-the-satellite/" target="_blank">the Planck satellite</a> at a range of frequencies.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both papers make some basic points that undermine confidence in BICEP2&#8217;s case against dust <em>(e.g. by arguing that BICEP2, by overestimating the intensity of dust emission as measured by Planck, was led to strongly underestimate the average amount of dust polarization; that BICEP2 disregarded lensing effects in one of its arguments against dust; that BICEP2&#8217;s evidence that their data was uncorrelated with dust measurements carries no weight).</em>  But when the papers try to make more quantitative statements about just how big the dust effect could be&#8230; well.  As far as I can tell, the methods used involve arbitrary judgment calls, and in the second paper these aren&#8217;t even clearly explained, and lead to key claims that can&#8217;t be verified by the reader.  That said, I&#8217;m not suggesting that anyone could do any better right now, given how little information we have about polarization in the BICEP2 region.  But I would suggest that experts read the words in these papers <em>very</em> carefully before attempting to evaluate the plausibility and reliability of the most important plots shown.</p>
<p>Since the whole discussion is currently so vague, I probably won&#8217;t say more about this until someone says something more convincing, or until BICEP2 publicly responds, if they choose to do so. The bottom line, for now, is clear enough: BICEP2 hasn&#8217;t made a case that overwhelmingly convinces the world&#8217;s experts.  The community will therefore remain collectively undecided until a precise determination is made of the amount of polarized dust in BICEP2&#8217;s region of the sky.  That lies six months to a year in the future. Until then, our knowledge will remain hazy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A scientific controversy has been brewing concerning the results of <a href="http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/CMB/bicep2/" target="_blank">BICEP2</a>, the experiment that measured polarized microwaves coming from a patch of the sky, and whose measurement has been widely interpreted as <a title="Did BICEP2 Detect Gravitational Waves Directly or Indirectly?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/04/30/did-bicep2-detect-gravitational-waves-directly-or-indirectly/" target="_blank">a discovery of gravitational waves</a>, probably from <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">cosmic inflation</a>. <em>(Here&#8217;s <a title="BICEP2: New Evidence Of Cosmic Inflation!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/bicep2-new-evidence-of-cosmic-inflation/" target="_blank">my post about the discovery</a>, here&#8217;s <a title="A Primer On Today’s Events" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/a-primer-on-todays-events/" target="_blank">some background so you can understand it more easily</a>. Here are <a title="History of the Universe" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/" target="_blank">some of my articles about the early universe</a>.)</em>  On the day of the announcement, some elements of the media hailed it as a great discovery without reminding readers of something very important: <strong>it&#8217;s provisional!</strong></p>
<p>From the very beginning of the BICEP2 story, I&#8217;ve been reminding you (<a title="BICEP2: New Evidence Of Cosmic Inflation!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/bicep2-new-evidence-of-cosmic-inflation/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a title="If It Holds Up, What Might BICEP2′s Discovery Mean?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/18/if-its-holds-up-what-might-bicep2s-discovery-mean/" target="_blank">here</a>) that it is very common for claims of great scientific discoveries to disappear after further scrutiny, and that a declaration of victory by the scientific community comes much more slowly and deliberately than it often does in the press. Every scientist knows that while science, as a collective process viewed over time, very rarely makes mistakes, individual experiments and experimenters are often wrong.  <em>(To its credit, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html" target="_blank">the New York Times article</a> contained some cautionary statements in its prose, and also quoted scientists making cautionary statements.  Other media outlets forgot.)</em></p>
<p>Doing forefront science is extremely difficult, because it requires near-perfection. A single unfortunate mistake in a very complex experiment can create an effect that appears similar to what the experimenters were looking for, but is a fake. Scientists are all well-aware of this; we&#8217;ve all seen examples, some of which took years to diagnose. And so, as with any claim of a big discovery, you should view the BICEP2 result as <em><strong>provisional, until checked thoroughly by outside experts, and until confirmed by other experiments.</strong></em></p>
<p>What could go wrong with BICEP2?  On purely logical grounds, the BICEP2 result, interpreted as evidence for cosmic inflation, could be problematic if <em>any one</em> of the following four things is true:</p>
<p>1) The experiment itself has a technical problem, and the polarized microwaves they observe actually don&#8217;t exist.</p>
<p>2) The polarized microwaves are real, but they aren&#8217;t coming from ancient gravitational waves; they are instead coming from dust (very small grains of material) that is distributed around the galaxy between the stars, and that can radiate polarized microwaves.</p>
<p>3) The polarization really is coming from the cosmic microwave background (the leftover glow from the Big Bang), but it is not coming from gravitational waves; instead it comes from some other unknown source.</p>
<p>4) The polarization is really coming from gravitational waves, but these waves are not due to cosmic inflation but to some other source in the early universe.</p>
<p>The current controversy concerns point 2.<span id="more-7659"></span></p>
<p><strong>Dust in the Sky</strong></p>
<p>One of the challenges for the BICEP2 measurement (and any others like it) is that dust grains in the galaxy, spinning in the presence of magnetic fields, absorbing light, and re-radiating it as somewhat-polarized microwaves, can give a signal that would mimic or obscure a signal of polarized microwaves that are generated by ancient gravitational waves. Consequently, one of the things that the BICEP2 people had to show, to convince first themselves and then others that they were <em>really</em> seeing effects of gravitational waves, was to obtain and present evidence that the effect of polarized dust, in the part of the sky in which they were looking, is too small to affect their measurement. <strong><em>It is this evidence that is now coming into question.</em></strong></p>
<p>If you had a perfect experiment and all the money and time you could want, it would be straightforward to figure out whether you were seeing polarized microwaves from dust or polarized microwaves caused by gravitational waves.  Here&#8217;s how: the amount of polarized light from dust grows rapidly as you look at higher and higher frequency microwaves, peaking at about 400 GHz (GHz = billions [G] of cycles per second [Hz]) while the amount from gravitational waves falls slowly at higher frequencies. So <strong>if</strong> you could measure the polarization at various frequencies, then by looking at whether your polarization signal does or does not increase rapidly with frequency between 100 and 400 GHz, you could distinguish dust-generated polarization easily from gravitational-wave-generated polarization.</p>
<p>But BICEP2&#8217;s high-precision measurements of microwaves have only been made at one frequency (150 GHz &#8212; measurements at 100 GHz will also be available in future).  So to assure their polarization signal wasn&#8217;t from dust, the BICEP2 experimenters had to obtain information from another source. In their paper, they gave an argument that polarized dust was far too small &#8212; at least four and perhaps ten times too small &#8212; to affect their measurement. They did this in two types of ways, indicated in the figure below, which is taken from the BICEP2 paper and annotated by me.</p>

BICEP2 data is black dots showing a large polarization signal. This is consistent with the thin red dashed curve, which is what would be expected for a large amount of gravitational waves from cosmic inflation. Colored dashed curves near the bottom of the graph show various predictions for the size of the effect from dust. (Ignore the corresponding solid curves unless you&#8217;re an expert.) The dashed curves labeled DDM1 and DDM2 are estimates by BICEP2 based on Planck data, some of which has not been published.  The worry is that these estimates might not properly account for Planck&#8217;s data, and that correct estimates might be as large as BICEP2&#8217;s signal, or be so uncertain that no inference concerning BICEP2&#8217;s signal can yet be drawn.</p></div>
<p>One argument relied on various people&#8217;s models of how dust is distributed around the galaxy. These models all show that the amount of dust-generated polarization should be extremely small: most of the lower curves in the figure are from these models, and they lie very close to zero compared to the BICEP2 data.  But this argument is only slightly reassuring, because <em>these models are really highly-educated guesses.  </em> A claim of such an important discovery shouldn&#8217;t rest on that kind of foundation.</p>
<p>So the really strong argument BICEP2 presented was based on reinterpreting some data from the Planck experiment.  This data had only partly been published; some of it had only been made public in graphical form, in plots that were presented during talks at conferences.  It mainly involves polarization from dust, measured by Planck across the sky, mainly at 353 GHz (where dust has the biggest effect).   The BICEP people said to themselves: suppose that the polarization Planck sees comes entirely from dust; well, we know how the polarization effect depends on frequency, so we can infer how much polarization from dust we would find at the BICEP2 frequency. This argument showed that the effect of dust in the region of the sky they were looking at was far too small for them to worry about, even if they viewed it very conservatively; there&#8217;s no way it could explain the signal that they see.  More precisely, of the two estimates I&#8217;ve marked with an arrow, even the worst case scenario, DDM2 (the dashed blue curve), was far below the BICEP2 data.  So there was no way, in the view of the BICEP2 team, that their signal could be coming from dust.</p>
<p>But some experts believe that there&#8217;s something problematic with the way BICEP2 did this, and that when done right, it is possible that the dust polarization will be a far bigger effect than BICEP2 estimated.  <em>[Raphael Flauger is one person with serious concerns: here is <a href="http://www.pctp.princeton.edu/pctp/SpecialEventSimplicity2014/SpecialEventSimplicity2014.html" target="_blank">a talk that he gave this past week</a>, but I&#8217;m afraid that only experts have a hope of understanding it, and I myself have a number of crucial unanswered questions about his presentation.]</em>  I emphasize that <em><strong>I cannot confirm their belief is correct</strong></em>, as I cannot yet construct a completely coherent story from public information &#8212; so I&#8217;m not going to speculate about it. I advise you to emulate the universe, and be patient; the truth will come out eventually, almost certainly within a year.</p>
<p><strong>What Planck Didn&#8217;t Say</strong></p>
<p>Another part of this story is that a couple of weeks ago Planck put out a paper (not published yet, but submitted for publication in a journal) showing their measurements of polarized dust across the sky&#8230; or rather, across <em>much</em> of the sky.  They&#8217;ve done measurements at various frequencies and can, as I described already, figure out how much polarization is coming from dust. You would think this measurement would have settled the issue; either BICEP&#8217;s argument agrees with or doesn&#8217;t agree with what Planck now says. But the whole point here is that BICEP2 makes more precise polarization measurements than Planck does. And in their recent paper, Planck only presents measurements in parts of the sky where they have a strong enough signal that they are confident that they <strong>know</strong> what they&#8217;re seeing, at high precision. Unfortunately, the region where BICEP2 is looking &#8212; a region where the amount of dust is very low, which is exactly why BICEP2 wants to do measurements there &#8212; is a region where Planck can&#8217;t see a strong enough signal to be sure how much polarized dust is present.</p>
<p>So it may well be that currently no one &#8212; not Planck, not BICEP2, not anyone &#8212; really knows for sure how much polarized dust there is in the BICEP2 region of the sky. [Or if the Planck folks already basically know, one can imagine, given how much rides on the answer, that they&#8217;re not telling until they&#8217;re <em>absolutely</em> sure.] Whether the real effect of dust is as small as BICEP2 claimed, or whether it is as big as their signal &#8212; whether their huge discovery of gravitational waves stands, or whether they&#8217;ve merely discovered that dust in the galaxy is far more polarized than expected &#8212; is simply not something that we can know for sure yet.</p>
<p>But all of this confusion probably does add some <strong>uncertainty</strong> &#8212; both the colloquial uncertainty <em>(did BICEP2 really make a big discovery?)</em> and the technical uncertainty <em>(how statistically significant is BICEP2&#8217;s observation?)</em>. It&#8217;s up to BICEP2 to go back through their arguments and determine how much change, if any, they have to make&#8230; and whether, after any appropriate adjustments, their discovery has become notably more tentative than it was before.</p>
<p><strong>Science, Inc.</strong></p>
<p>What you are getting a glimpse of, if you are following this story, is the scientific process in action. In physics &#8212; I can&#8217;t speak for other sciences, and I know there are some where it is not true &#8212; the assumption by the experts is that <em>every claim of a scientific result, especially a major discovery, is <strong>wrong until proven right</strong></em>.  Every result, especially one of particular significance, is poked and prodded, scrutinized and questioned, and subject to a battery of stress tests. Of course the scientists doing the measurement do this first, as best they can, knowing that it&#8217;s better to discover mistakes in private than in public. Then their colleagues do the same, checking the details of the measurement, repeating it (more or less), and trying to do even better measurements of the same effect. Anywhere along the way during this process, an experiment can fail to pass muster. But those that do pass muster &#8212; such as the recent <a title="The Day of the Higgs!!!!  DISCOVERY!!! History Made!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/07/04/the-day-of-the-higgs/" target="_blank">discovery of a Higgs particle</a>, the discovery that <a title="A Nobel Prize That’s No Surprise" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/10/04/a-nobel-prize-thats-no-surprise/" target="_blank">the universe&#8217;s expansion is accelerating</a>, and the <a title="Did BICEP2 Detect Gravitational Waves Directly or Indirectly?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/04/30/did-bicep2-detect-gravitational-waves-directly-or-indirectly/" target="_blank">indirect discovery of gravitational waves back in the 1980s</a> &#8212; will be around for the ages.</p>
<p>BICEP2&#8217;s result, along with its widespread interpretation as evidence of inflation, may yet survive the gauntlet of tests to which it is being subjected. But it&#8217;s far too soon to tell.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For those who haven&#8217;t heard: Professor Gerry Guralnik died. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/04/us/gerald-guralnik-77-a-god-particle-pioneer-dies.html" target="_blank">Here&#8217;s the New York Times obituary</a>, which contains a few physics imperfections (though the most serious mistake in an earlier version was corrected, thankfully), but hopefully avoids any errors about Guralnik&#8217;s life.  Here&#8217;s <a href="http://news.brown.edu/pressreleases/2014/04/guralnik" target="_blank">another press release</a>, from Brown University.</p>
<p>Guralnik, with Tom Kibble and Carl Hagen, wrote one of <a title="The Twists and Turns of Hi(gg)story" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/08/the-twists-and-turns-of-higgstory/" target="_blank">the four 1964 papers</a> which represent the birth of the idea of the <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">&#8220;Higgs&#8221; field</a>, now understood as the source of mass for <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the known elementary particles</a> &#8212; an idea that was confirmed by <a title="Discovery of the Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-discovery-of-the-higgs/" target="_blank">the discovery of a type of &#8220;Higgs&#8221; particle in 2012</a> at the Large Hadron Collider.  <em>(I find it sad that the obituary is sullied with a headline that contains the words &#8220;God Particle&#8221; &#8212; a term that no physicist involved in the relevant research ever used, and which was invented in the 1990s, not as science or even as religion, but for $$$&#8230; by someone who was trying <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-God-Particle-Universe-Question/dp/0618711686" target="_blank">to sell his book</a>.)</em> The other three papers &#8212; the first by Robert Brout and Francois Englert, and the second and third by Peter Higgs, were rewarded with <a title="The Twists and Turns of Hi(gg)story" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/08/the-twists-and-turns-of-higgstory/" target="_blank">a Nobel Prize in 2013</a>; it was <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2013/" target="_blank">given just to Englert and Higgs</a>, Brout having died too early, in 2011.  Though Guralnik, Hagen and Kibble won many other prizes, they were not awarded a Nobel for their work, a decision that will remain forever controversial.</p>
<p>But at least Guralnik lived long enough to learn, as Brout sadly did not, that his ideas were realized in nature, and to see <a title="Higgs Discovery: The Data" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-discovery-of-the-higgs/higgs-discovery-the-data/" target="_blank">the consequences of these ideas in real data</a>. In the end, that&#8217;s the real prize, and one that no human can award.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first day of <a href="http://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/activities/dbdetails?acro=joefest-c14" target="_blank">the conference celebrating theoretical physicist Joe Polchinski</a> (see also <a title="Celebrating a Great Brane" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/02/27/celebrating-a-great-brane/" target="_blank">yesterday&#8217;s post</a>) emphasized the broad impact of his research career.  Thursday&#8217;s talks, some on quantum gravity and others on <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/23/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions/" target="_blank">quantum field theory</a>, were given by</p>
<ul>
<li>Juan Maldacena, on his latest thinking on the relation between gravity, geometry and the entropy of quantum entanglement;</li>
<li>Igor Klebanov, on some fascinating work in which new relations have been found between some simple quantum field theories and a very poorly understood and exotic theory, known as Vassiliev theory (a theory that has more fields than a field theory but fewer than a string theory);</li>
<li>Raphael Bousso, on his recent attempts to prove the so-called &#8220;covariant entropy bound&#8221;, another relation between entropy and geometry, that Bousso conjectured over a decade ago;</li>
<li>Henrietta Elvang, on the resolution of a puzzle involving the relation between a supersymmetric field theory and a gravitational description of that same theory;</li>
<li>Nima Arkani-Hamed, about his work on the amplituhedron, a set of geometric objects that allow for the computation of particle scattering in various quantum field theories (and who related how one of Polchinski&#8217;s papers on quantum field theory was crucial in convincing him to stay in the field of high-energy physics);</li>
<li>Yours truly, in which I quickly reviewed my papers with Polchinski relating string theory and quantum field theory, emphasizing what an amazing experience it is to work with him; then I spoke briefly about my most recent <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC] research (<a title="Unexpected Decays of the Higgs Particle: What We Found" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/02/11/non-standard-model-higgs-particle-decays-what-we-found/" target="_blank">#1</a>,<a title="Where Stands Supersymmetry (as of 12/2013)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/where-stands-supersymmetry-122013/" target="_blank">#2</a>), and concluded with some provocative remarks about what it would mean if the LHC, having found the last missing particle of the Standard Model (i.e. <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">the Higgs particle</a>), finds nothing more.</li>
</ul>
<p>The lectures have been recorded, so you will soon be able to find them at the <a href="http://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/" target="_blank">KITP site</a> and listen to any that interest you.</p>
<p>There were also two panel discussions. One was about the tremendous impact of Polchinski&#8217;s 1995 work on <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part 9)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/02/26/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-9/" target="_blank">D-branes</a> on quantum field theory (including particle physics, nuclear physics and condensed matter physics), on quantum gravity (especially through black hole physics), on several branches of mathematics, and on string theory. It&#8217;s worth noting that every talk listed above was directly or indirectly affected by D-branes, a trend which will continue in most of Friday&#8217;s talks.  There was also a rather hilarious panel involving his former graduate students, who spoke about what it was like to have Polchinski as an advisor. (Sorry, but the very funny stories told at the evening banquet were not recorded. [And don&#8217;t ask me about them, because I&#8217;m not telling.])</p>
<p>Let me relate one thing that Eric Gimon, one of Polchinski&#8217;s former students, had to say during the student panel. Gimon, a former <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0212061" target="_blank">collaborator of mine</a>, left academia some time ago and now works in the private sector. When it was his turn to speak, he asked, rhetorically, &#8220;So, how does calculating partition functions in K3 orientifolds&#8221; <em>(which is part of what Gimon did as a graduate student)</em> &#8220;prepare you for the real world?&#8221; How indeed, you may wonder. His answer: &#8220;A sense of pertinence.&#8221; In other words, <strong><em>an ability to recognize which aspects of a puzzle or problem are nothing but distracting details, and which ones really matter and deserve your attention</em></strong>. It struck me as an elegant expression of what it means to be a physicist.</p>

<p>What is &#8220;<a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/virtually-speaking-science" target="_blank">Virtually Speaking Science</a>&#8220;?  It is an online radio program that presents, according to its website:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><span style="color:#008000;">Informal conversations hosted by science writers Alan Boyle, Tom Levenson and Jennifer Ouellette, who explore the explore the often-volatile landscape of science, politics and policy, the history and economics of science, science deniers and its relationship to democracy, and the role of women in the sciences. </span></em></li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ah, the fast-paced life of a theoretical physicist!  I just got done giving a one-hour talk in Rome, given at a workshop for experts on the ATLAS experiment, one of the two general purpose experiments at the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC]. Tomorrow morning I&#8217;ll be talking with a colleague at the Rutherford Appleton Lab in the U.K., an expert from CMS (the other general purpose experiment at the LHC). Then it&#8217;s off to San Francisco, where tomorrow (Wednesday, 5 p.m. Pacific Time, 8 p.m. Eastern), at the Exploratorium, I&#8217;ll be joined by Caltech&#8217;s Sean Carroll, who is an expert on cosmology and particle physics and <a title="Sean Carroll’s Higgs Book Wins a Big Prize" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/11/25/sean-carrolls-higgs-book-wins-a-big-prize/" target="_blank">whose book on the Higgs boson discovery just won a nice prize</a>, and we&#8217;ll be discussing science with science writer Alan Boyle, as <a title="Wednesday: Sean Carroll &amp; I Interviewed by Alan Boyle" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/02/04/wednesday-sean-carroll-i-interviewed-by-alan-boyle/" target="_blank">we did back in February</a>. [You can <a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/virtually-speaking-science/2013/12/05/alan-boyle-matt-strassler-sean-carroll" target="_blank">click here to listen in to Wednesday&#8217;s event.</a>]  Next, on Thursday I&#8217;ll be at a meeting hosted in Stony Brook, on Long Island in New York State, discussing a Higgs-particle-related scientific project with theoretical physics colleagues as far flung as Hong Kong.  On Friday I shall rest.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;How does he do it?&#8221;</em>, you ask. Hey, a private jet is a wonderful thing! Simple, convenient, no waiting at the gate; I highly recommend it! However &#8212; I don&#8217;t own one. All I have is Skype, and other Skype-like software.  My words will cross the globe, but my body won&#8217;t be going anywhere this week.</p>
<p>We should not take this kind of communication for granted! If the speed of light were 186,000 miles (300,000 kilometers) <strong>per hour</strong>, instead of 186,000 miles (300,000 kilometers) <strong>per second</strong>, ordinary life wouldn&#8217;t obviously change that much, but we simply couldn&#8217;t communicate internationally the way we do. It&#8217;s 4100 miles (6500 kilometers) across the earth&#8217;s surface to Rome; light takes about 0.02 seconds to travel that distance, so that&#8217;s the fastest anything can travel to make the trip. But if light traveled 186,000 miles <strong><em>per hour</em></strong>, then it would take over a minute for my words to reach Rome, making conversation completely impossible. A back-and-forth conversation would be difficult even between New York and Boston &#8212; for any signal to travel the 200 miles (300 kilometers) would require four seconds, so you&#8217;d be waiting for 8 seconds to hear the other person answer your questions. We&#8217;d have similar problems &#8212; slightly less severe &#8212; if the earth were as large as the sun.  And someday, as we populate the solar system, we&#8217;ll actually have this problem.</p>
<p>So think about that next time you call or Skype or otherwise contact a distant friend or colleague, and you have a conversation just as though you were next door, despite your being separated half-way round the planet. It&#8217;s a small world (and a fast one) after all.</p>
