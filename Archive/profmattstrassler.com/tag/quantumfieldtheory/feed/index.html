										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week, the community of high-energy physicists &#8212; of those of us fascinated by particles, fields, strings, black holes, and the universe at large &#8212; is mourning the loss of one of the great theoretical physicists of our time, Joe Polchinski. It pains me deeply to write these words.</p>
<p>Everyone who knew him personally will miss his special qualities &#8212; his boyish grin, his slightly wicked sense of humor, his charming way of stopping mid-sentence to think deeply, his athleticism and friendly competitiveness. Everyone who knew his research will feel the absence of his particular form of genius, his exceptional insight, his unique combination of abilities, which I&#8217;ll try to sketch for you below. Those of us who were lucky enough to know him both personally and scientifically &#8212; well, we lose twice.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/kitp/news/polchinski.jpg" alt="Image result for joe polchinski" /></p>
<p>Polchinski &#8212; Joe, to all his colleagues &#8212; had one of those brains that works magic, and works magically. Scientific minds are as individual as personalities. Each physicist has a unique combination of talents and skills (and weaknesses); in modern lingo, each of us has a superpower or two. Rarely do you find two scientists who have the same ones.</p>
<p>Joe had several superpowers, and they were really strong. He had a tremendous knack for looking at old problems and seeing them in a new light, often overturning conventional wisdom or restating that wisdom in a new, clearer way. And he had prodigious technical ability, which allowed him to follow difficult calculations all the way to the end, on paths that would have deterred most of us.</p>
<p>One of the greatest privileges of my life was to work with Joe, not once but four times. I think I can best tell you a little about him, and about some of his greatest achievements, through the lens of that unforgettable experience.</p>
<p><em>[To my colleagues: this post was obviously written in trying circumstances, and it is certainly possible that my memory of distant events is foggy and in error.  I welcome any corrections that you might wish to suggest.]</em></p>
<p>Our papers between 1999 and 2006 were a sequence of sorts, aimed at understanding more fully the profound connection between quantum field theory &#8212; the language of particle physics &#8212; and string theory &#8212; best-known today as a candidate for a quantum theory of gravity. In each of those papers, as in many thousands of others written after 1995, Joe&#8217;s most influential contribution to physics played a central role. This was the discovery of objects known as &#8220;D-branes&#8221;, which he found in the context of string theory. (The term is a generalization of the word `membrane&#8217;.)</p>
<p>I can already hear the polemical haters of string theory screaming at me. &#8216;<em>A discovery in <strong>string theory</strong>,&#8217;</em> some will shout, pounding the table, &#8216;<em>an untested and untestable theory that&#8217;s not even wrong, should not be called a discovery in <strong>physics</strong></em>.&#8217; Pay them no mind; they&#8217;re not even close, as you&#8217;ll see by the end of my remarks.</p>
<p><strong>The Great D-scovery</strong></p>
<p>In 1989, Joe, working with two young scientists, Jin Dai and Rob Leigh, was exploring some details of string theory, and carrying out a little mathematical exercise. Normally, in string theory, strings are little lines or loops that are free to move around anywhere they like, much like particles moving around in this room. But in some cases, particles aren&#8217;t in fact free to move around; you could, for instance, study particles that are trapped on the surface of a liquid, or trapped in a very thin whisker of metal. With strings, there can be a new type of trapping that particles can&#8217;t have &#8212; you could perhaps trap one end, or both ends, of the string within a surface, while allowing the middle of the string to move freely. The place <em><strong>where</strong></em> <strong><em>a string&#8217;s end may be trapped</em></strong> &#8212; whether a point, a line, a surface, or something more exotic in higher dimensions &#8212; is what we now call a &#8220;D-brane&#8221;.  <em>[The `D&#8217; arises for uninteresting technical reasons.]</em></p>
<p>Joe and his co-workers hit the jackpot, but they didn&#8217;t realize it yet. What they discovered, in retrospect, was that D-branes are an <em>automatic</em> feature of string theory. They&#8217;re not optional; you can&#8217;t choose to study string theories that don&#8217;t have them. And they aren&#8217;t just surfaces or lines that sit still. They&#8217;re physical objects that can roam the world. They have mass and create gravitational effects. They can move around and scatter off each other. They&#8217;re just as real, and just as important, as the strings themselves!</p>
<div style="width: 382px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/string/dbrane.jpg" alt="D-Branes" width="372" height="420" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Fig. 1: D branes (in green) are physical objects on which a fundamental string (in red) can terminate.</p></div>
<p>It was as though Joe and his collaborators started off trying to understand why the chicken crossed the road, and ended up discovering the existence of bicycles, cars, trucks, buses, and jet aircraft.  It was that unexpected, and that rich.</p>
<p>And yet, nobody, not even Joe and his colleagues, quite realized what they&#8217;d done. Rob Leigh, Joe&#8217;s co-author, had the office next to mine for a couple of years, and we wrote five papers together between 1993 and 1995. Yet I think Rob mentioned his work on D-branes to me just once or twice, in passing, and never explained it to me in detail. Their paper had less than twenty citations as 1995 began.</p>
<p>In 1995 the understanding of string theory took a huge leap forward. That was the moment when it was realized that all five known types of string theory are different sides of the same die &#8212; that there&#8217;s really only one string theory.  A flood of papers appeared in which certain black holes, and generalizations of black holes &#8212; black strings, black surfaces, and the like &#8212; played a central role. The relations among these were fascinating, but often confusing.</p>
<p>And then, on October 5, 1995, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9510017">a paper appeared that changed the whole discussion</a>, forever. It was Joe, explaining D-branes to those of us who&#8217;d barely heard of his earlier work, and showing that many of these black holes, black strings and black surfaces were actually D-branes in disguise. His paper made everything clearer, simpler, and easier to calculate; it was an immediate hit. By the beginning of 1996 it had 50 citations; twelve months later, the citation count was approaching 300.</p>
<p><em>So what? Great for string theorists, but without any connection to experiment and the real world.  What good is it to the rest of us?</em> Patience. I&#8217;m just getting to that.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s it Got to Do With Nature?</strong></p>
<p>Our current understanding of the make-up and workings of the universe is in terms of particles. Material objects are made from atoms, themselves made from electrons orbiting a nucleus; and the nucleus is made from neutrons and protons. We learned in the 1970s that protons and neutrons are themselves made from particles called quarks and antiquarks and gluons &#8212; specifically, from a &#8220;sea&#8221; of gluons and a few quark/anti-quark pairs, within which sit three additional quarks with no anti-quark partner&#8230; often called the `valence quarks&#8217;.  We call protons and neutrons, and all other particles with three valence quarks, `baryons&#8221;.   (Note that there are no particles with just one valence quark, or two, or four &#8212; all you get is baryons, with three.)</p>
<p>In the 1950s and 1960s, physicists discovered short-lived particles much like protons and neutrons, with a similar sea, but which  contain one valence quark and one valence anti-quark. Particles of this type are referred to as &#8220;mesons&#8221;.  I&#8217;ve sketched a typical meson and a typical baryon in Figure 2.  (The simplest meson is called a &#8220;pion&#8221;; it&#8217;s the most common particle produced in the proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider.)</p>

<p>But the quark/gluon picture of mesons and baryons, back in the late 1960s, was just an idea, and it was in competition with a proposal that mesons are little strings. These are not, I hasten to add, the &#8220;theory of everything&#8221; strings that you learn about in Brian Greene&#8217;s books, which are a billion billion times smaller than a proton. In a &#8220;theory of everything&#8221; string theory, often <em>all</em> the types of particles of nature, including electrons, photons and Higgs bosons, are tiny tiny strings. What I&#8217;m talking about is a &#8220;theory of mesons&#8221; string theory, a much less ambitious idea, in which only the mesons are strings.  They&#8217;re much larger: just about as long as a proton is wide. That&#8217;s small by human standards, but immense compared to theory-of-everything strings.</p>
<p>Why did people think mesons were strings? <strong><em>Because there was <a href="http://www.scielo.br/img/revistas/bjp/v35n1/a06fig04.gif">experimental evidence</a> for it! </em></strong>(Here&#8217;s <a href="http://slideplayer.com/slide/9177976/27/images/11/Elastic+scattering+Impact+picture+and+Regge+models.jpg">another example</a>.)  And that evidence didn&#8217;t go away after quarks were discovered. Instead, theoretical physicists gradually understood <em>why</em> quarks and gluons might produce mesons that behave a bit like strings. If you spin a meson fast enough (and this can happen by accident in experiments), its valence quark and anti-quark may separate, and the sea of objects between them forms what is called a &#8220;flux tube.&#8221; See Figure 3. <em>[In certain superconductors, somewhat similar flux tubes can trap magnetic fields.]</em> It&#8217;s kind of a thick string rather than a thin one, but still, it shares enough properties with a string in string theory that it can produce experimental results that are similar to string theory&#8217;s predictions.</p>

<p>And so, from the mid-1970s onward, people were confident that quantum field theories like the one that describes quarks and gluons can create objects with stringy behavior. A number of physicists &#8212; including some of the most famous and respected ones &#8212; made a bolder, more ambitious claim: <em>that quantum field theory and string theory are profoundly related, in some fundamental way.</em> But they weren&#8217;t able to be precise about it; they had strong evidence, but it wasn&#8217;t ever entirely clear or convincing.</p>
<p>In particular, there was an important unresolved puzzle. If mesons are strings, then what are baryons? What are protons and neutrons, with their three valence quarks? What do they look like if you spin them quickly? The sketches people drew looked something like Figure 3. A baryon would perhaps become three joined flux tubes (with one possibly much longer than the other two), each with its own valence quark at the end.  In a stringy cartoon, that baryon would be three strings, each with a free end, with the strings attached to some sort of junction. This junction of three strings was called a &#8220;baryon vertex.&#8221;  If mesons are little strings, the fundamental objects in a string theory, what is the baryon vertex from the string theory point of view?!  Where is it hiding &#8212; what is it made of &#8212; in the mathematics of string theory?</p>

<p><em>[Experts: Notice that the vertex has nothing to do with the quarks. It&#8217;s a property of the sea &#8212; specifically, of the gluons. Thus, in a world with only gluons &#8212; a world whose strings naively form loops without ends &#8212; it must still be possible, with sufficient energy, to create a vertex-antivertex pair. Thus field theory predicts that these vertices <strong>must</strong> exist in closed string theories, though they are linearly confined.]</em></p>

<p>No one knew. But isn&#8217;t it interesting that the most prominent feature of this vertex is that it is a location <em><strong>where a string&#8217;s end can be trapped</strong>?</em></p>
<p>Everything changed in the period 1997-2000. Following insights from many other physicists, and using D-branes as the essential tool, Juan Maldacena finally made the connection between quantum field theory and string theory precise. He was able to relate strings with gravity and extra dimensions, which you can read about in Brian Greene&#8217;s books, with the physics of particles in just three spatial dimensions, similar to those of the real world, with only non-gravitational forces.  It was soon clear that the most ambitious and radical thinking of the &#8217;70s was correct &#8212; that almost every quantum field theory, with its particles and forces, can alternatively be viewed as a string theory. It&#8217;s a bit analogous to the way that a painting can be described in English or in Japanese &#8212; <em><strong>fields/particles and strings/gravity are, in this context, two very different languages for talking about exactly the same thing.</strong></em></p>
<p>The saga of the baryon vertex took a turn in May 1998, when <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9805112">Ed Witten showed how a similar vertex appears in Maldacena&#8217;s examples</a>. <em>[Note added: I had forgotten that two days after Witten&#8217;s paper, David Gross and Hirosi Ooguri submitted <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9805129v2">a beautiful, wide-ranging paper</a>, whose section on baryons contains many of the same ideas.]</em> Not surprisingly, this vertex was a D-brane &#8212; specifically a D-particle, an object on which the strings extending from freely-moving quarks could end. It wasn&#8217;t yet quite satisfactory, because the gluons and quarks in Maldacena&#8217;s examples roam free and don&#8217;t form mesons or baryons. Correspondingly the baryon vertex isn&#8217;t really a physical object; if you make one, it quickly diffuses away into nothing. Nevertheless, Witten&#8217;s paper made it obvious what was going on. <em>To the extent real-world mesons can be viewed as strings, real-world protons and neutrons can be viewed as <strong>strings attached to a D-brane</strong>.</em></p>

I don&#8217;t remember who found one first, but I do know that one of the earliest examples showed up in my first paper with Joe, in the year 2000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Working with Joe</strong></p>
<p>That project arose during my September 1999 visit to the KITP (Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics) in Santa Barbara, where Joe was a faculty member. Some time before that I happened to have studied a field theory (called <em>N=1*</em>) that differed from Maldacena&#8217;s examples only slightly, but in which meson-like objects do form. One of the first talks I heard when I arrived at KITP was by Rob Myers, about a weird property of D-branes that he&#8217;d discovered. During that talk I made a connection between Myers&#8217; observation and a feature of the N=1* field theory, and I had one of those &#8220;aha&#8221; moments that physicists live for. I suddenly knew what the string theory that describes the N=1*  field theory must look like.</p>
<p>But for me, the answer was bad news. To work out the details was clearly going to require a very difficult set of calculations, using aspects of string theory about which I knew almost nothing <em>[non-holomorphic curved branes in high-dimensional curved geometry.]</em> The best I could hope to do, if I worked alone, would be to write a conceptual paper with lots of pictures, and far more conjectures than demonstrable facts.</p>
<p>But I was at KITP.  Joe and I had had a good personal rapport for some years, and I knew that we found similar questions exciting. And Joe was the brane-master; he knew everything about D-branes. So I decided my best hope was to persuade Joe to join me. I engaged in a bit of persistent cajoling. Very fortunately for me, it paid off.</p>
<p>I went back to the east coast, and Joe and I went to work. Every week or two Joe would email some research notes with some preliminary calculations in string theory. They had such a high level of technical sophistication, and so few pedagogical details, that I felt like a child; I could barely understand anything he was doing. We made slow progress. Joe did an important warm-up calculation, but I found it really hard to follow. If the warm-up string theory calculation was so complex, had we any hope of solving the full problem?  Even Joe was a little concerned.</p>
<p><img class=" alignright" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSIgjqZN7VDuiTCjxMsnfwddwDFPEIvmKaTYqKdIU551Ed7xWJL" alt="Image result for polchinski joe" />And then one day, I received a message that resounded with a triumphant cackle &#8212; a sort of &#8220;we got &#8217;em!&#8221; that anyone who knew Joe will recognize. Through a spectacular trick, he&#8217;d figured out how use his warm-up example to make the full problem easy! Instead of months of work ahead of us, we were essentially done.</p>
<p>From then on, it was great fun! Almost every week had the same pattern. I&#8217;d be thinking about a quantum field theory phenomenon that I knew about, one that should be visible from the string viewpoint &#8212; such as the baryon vertex. I knew enough about D-branes to develop a heuristic argument about how it should show up. I&#8217;d call Joe and tell him about it, and maybe send him a sketch. A few days later, a set of notes would arrive by email, containing a complete calculation verifying the phenomenon. Each calculation was unique, a little gem, involving a distinctive investigation of exotically-shaped D-branes sitting in a curved space. It was breathtaking to witness the speed with which Joe worked, the breadth and depth of his mathematical talent, and his unmatched understanding of these branes.</p>
<p><em>[Experts: It&#8217;s not instantly obvious that the N=1* theory has physical baryons, but it does; you have to choose the right vacuum, where the theory is partially Higgsed and partially confining. Then to infer, from Witten&#8217;s work, what the baryon vertex is, you have to understand brane crossings (which I knew about from Hanany-Witten days): Witten&#8217;s D5-brane baryon vertex operator creates a  physical baryon vertex in the form of a D3-brane 3-ball, whose boundary is an NS 5-brane 2-sphere located at a point in the usual three dimensions. And finally, a physical baryon is a vertex with n strings that are connected to nearby D5-brane 2-spheres. See chapter VI, sections B, C, and E, of our paper from 2000.]</em></p>
<p>Throughout our years of collaboration, it was always that way when we needed to go head-first into the equations; Joe inevitably left me in the dust, shaking my head in disbelief. That&#8217;s partly my weakness&#8230; I&#8217;m pretty average (for a physicist) when it comes to calculation. But a lot of it was Joe being so incredibly good at it.</p>
<p>Fortunately for me, the collaboration was still enjoyable, because I was almost always able to keep pace with Joe on the conceptual issues, sometimes running ahead of him. Among my favorite memories as a scientist are moments when I taught Joe something he didn&#8217;t know; he&#8217;d be silent for a few seconds, nodding rapidly, with an intent look &#8212; his eyes narrow and his mouth slightly open &#8212; as he absorbed the point.  &#8220;Uh-huh&#8230; uh-huh&#8230;&#8221;, he&#8217;d say.</p>
<p>But another side of Joe came out in our second paper. As we stood chatting in the KITP hallway, before we&#8217;d even decided exactly which question we were going to work on, Joe suddenly guessed the answer! And I couldn&#8217;t get him to explain which problem he&#8217;d solved, much less the solution, for several days!! It was quite disorienting.</p>
<p>This was another classic feature of Joe. Often he <em>knew</em> he&#8217;d found the answer to a puzzle (and he was almost always right), but he couldn&#8217;t say anything comprehensible about it until he&#8217;d had a few days to think and to turn his ideas into equations. During our collaboration, this happened several times. (I never said &#8220;Use your words, Joe&#8230;&#8221;, but perhaps I should have.) Somehow his mind was working in places that language doesn&#8217;t go, in ways that none of us outside his brain will ever understand. In him, there was something of an oracle.</p>
<p><strong>Looking Toward The Horizon</strong></p>
<p>Our interests gradually diverged after 2006; I focused on the Large Hadron Collider <em>[also known as the Large D-brane Collider]</em>, while Joe, after some other explorations, ended up thinking about black hole horizons and the information paradox. But I enjoyed his work from afar, especially when, in 2012, Joe and three colleagues (Ahmed Almheiri, Don Marolf, and James Sully) blew apart the idea of <strong><em>black hole complementarity</em></strong>, widely hoped to be the solution to the paradox. [<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/black-holes/black-hole-information-paradox-an-introduction/">I explained this subject here</a>, and also mentioned <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/12/12/two-days-of-polchinski-puzzles/">a talk Joe gave about it here</a>.]  The wreckage is still smoldering, and the paradox remains.</p>
<p>Then Joe fell ill, and we began to lose him, at far too young an age.  One of his last gifts to us was <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09093">his memoirs</a>, which taught each of us something about him that we didn&#8217;t know.  Finally, on Friday last, he crossed the horizon of no return.  If there&#8217;s no firewall there, he knows it now.</p>
<p>What, we may already wonder, will Joe&#8217;s scientific legacy be, decades from now?  It&#8217;s difficult to foresee how a theorist&#8217;s work will be viewed a century hence; science changes in unexpected ways, and what seems unimportant now may become central in future&#8230; as was the path for D-branes themselves in the course of the 1990s.  For those of us working today, D-branes in string theory are clearly Joe&#8217;s most important discovery &#8212; though his contributions to our understanding of black holes, cosmic strings, and aspects of field theory aren&#8217;t soon, if ever, to be forgotten.  But who knows? By the year 2100, string theory may be the accepted theory of quantum gravity, or it may just be a little-known tool for the study of quantum fields.</p>
<p>Yet even if the latter were to be string theory&#8217;s fate, I still suspect it will be D-branes that Joe is remembered for. Because &#8212; as I&#8217;ve tried to make clear &#8212; they&#8217;re <em><strong>real</strong></em>.  Really real.  There&#8217;s one in every proton, one in every neutron. Our bodies contain them by the billion billion billions. For that insight, that elemental contribution to human knowledge, our descendants can blame Joseph Polchinski.</p>
<p>Thanks for everything, Joe.  We&#8217;ll miss you terribly.  You so often taught us new ways to look at the world &#8212; and even at ourselves.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I continue with <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/23/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions/" target="_blank">my series of posts</a> on fields, strings and predictions.</p>
<p>During the 1980s, as I discussed <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part 8)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/01/23/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-8/">in the previous post in this series</a>, string theorists learned that of all the possible string theories that one could imagine, there were only <strong>five</strong> that were mathematically consistent.</p>
<p>What they learned in the first half of the 1990s, culminating in early 1995, is that <em>all five string theories are actually little corners of a single, more encompassing, and still somewhat mysterious theory</em>. In other words, after 30 years of studying various types of theories with strings in them, they ended up with just <strong>one</strong>!</p>
<p>On the one hand, that sort of sounds like a flop &#8212; all that work, by all those people, over two decades, and all we got for our efforts was <em>one new theory</em>?</p>
<p>On the other hand, it&#8217;s very tempting to think that the reason that everyone ended up converging on the same theory is that <strong><em>maybe it&#8217;s the only consistent theory of quantum gravity!</em></strong> At this point there&#8217;s no way to know for sure, but so far there&#8217;s no evidence against that possibility.  Certainly its a popular idea among string theorists.</p>
<p>This unique theory is called &#8220;M theory&#8221; today; we don&#8217;t know a better name, because we don&#8217;t really know what it is. We don&#8217;t know what it describes in general. We don&#8217;t know a principle by which to define it. Sometimes it is called &#8220;string/M theory&#8221; to remind us that it is string theory in certain corners.</p>

<p>Note that M theory is very different in one key respect from quantum field theory.  As I described in <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part 2)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/24/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-2/">the second post in this series</a>, &#8220;quantum field theory&#8221; is the term that describes the general case; &#8220;<strong>a</strong> quantum field theory&#8221; is a specific example within the infinite number of &#8220;quantum field theor<strong>ies</strong>&#8221;. But there&#8217;s no analogue of this distinction for M theory. M theory is (as far as anyone can discern) a unique theory; it is <strong><em>both</em></strong> the general <em><strong>and</strong></em> the specific case.  There is no category of &#8220;M theor<strong>ies</strong>&#8221;. However, this uniqueness, while remarkable, is not quite as profound as it might sound&#8230; for a reason I&#8217;ll return to in a future post.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the relationship between the five apparently very different string theories that appear in M theory is similar to the surprising relationships among various field theories that <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part 7)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/11/20/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-7/" target="_blank">I described in this post</a>. It&#8217;s <strong><em>not at all obvious</em></strong> that each string theory is related to the other four&#8230; which is why it took some time, and a very roundabout route involving the study of black holes and their generalizations to black strings and black branes, for this relationship to become clear.</p>
<p>But as it did become clear, it was realized that &#8220;M theory&#8221; (or &#8220;string/M theory&#8221;, as it is sometimes called) is not merely, or even mainly, a theory of strings; it&#8217;s much richer than that. In one corner it is actually a theory with 10 spatial (11 space-time) dimensions; this is a theory with membranes rather than strings, one which we understand poorly. And in all of its corners, the theory has more than just strings; it has generalizations of membranes, called &#8220;branes&#8221; in general. <em>[Yes, the joke&#8217;s been made already; the experts in this subject had indeed been brane-less for years.]</em> Particles are zero-dimensional points; strings are one-dimensional wiggly lines; membranes are two-dimensional surfaces. In the ordinary <em>three</em> spatial dimensions we can observe, that&#8217;s all we&#8217;ve got. But in superstring theory, with <em>nine</em> spatial dimensions, one doesn&#8217;t stop there. There are three-dimensional branes, called three-branes for short; there are four-branes, five-branes, and on up to eight-branes. [There are even nine-branes too, which are really just a way of changing all of space. The story is rich and fascinating both physically and mathematically.] The pattern of the various types of branes &#8212; specifically, which ones are found in which corners of M theory, and the phenomena that occur when they intersect one another &#8212; is a fantastically elegant story that was worked out in the early-to-mid 1990s.</p>
<p>A brane on which a fundamental string can end is called a &#8220;D-brane&#8221;. <a title="Two Days of Polchinski Puzzles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/12/12/two-days-of-polchinski-puzzles/" target="_blank">Joe Polchinski</a> is famous for having not only co-discovered these objects in the 1980s but for having recognized, in mid-1995, the wide-ranging role they play in the way the five different string theories are related to each other. I still remember vividly the profound effect that <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9510017" target="_blank">his 1995 paper</a> had on the field. A postdoctoral researcher at the time, I was attending bi-weekly lectures by Ed Witten on the new developments of that year. I recall that at the lecture following Polchinski&#8217;s paper, Witten said something to the effect that everything he&#8217;d said in his presentations so far needed to be rethought. And over the next few months, it was.</p>

There are no strings or D-branes, but there are M2-branes and M5- branes, in the 11-dimensional corner of M theory. A D-brane is an object where a fundamental string can end; therefore, in the presence of D-branes, a closed string can break into an open string with both ends on a D-brane (center and right).</p></div>
<p>The fact that string/M theory is <em>more</em> than just a theory of strings is strikingly similar to something known about quantum field theory for decades. Although quantum field theory was invented to understand particles in the context of Einstein&#8217;s special relativity, it turns out that it often describes <em><strong>more</strong></em> than particles. Field theory in three spatial dimensions can have <a title="Jets: The Manifestation of Quarks and Gluons" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/jets-the-manifestation-of-quarks-and-gluons/" target="_blank">string-like objects</a> (often called &#8220;<a title="Jets: The Manifestation of Quarks and Gluons" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/jets-the-manifestation-of-quarks-and-gluons/" target="_blank">flux tubes</a>&#8221;) and membrane-like objects (often called &#8220;domain walls&#8221;) and particle-like blobs (&#8220;magnetic monopoles&#8221;, &#8220;baryons&#8221;, and other structures). The simplest quantum field theories &#8212; <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part 3)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/01/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-3/" target="_blank">those for which successive approximation works</a> &#8212; are mainly theories of particles.  But flux tubes and domain walls and magnetic monopoles, which can&#8217;t be described in terms of particles, can show up even in those theories. So the complexities of M theory are perhaps not surprising. Yet it took physicists almost two decades to recognize that &#8220;branes&#8221; of various sorts are ubiquitous and essential in string/M theory. (We humans are pretty slow.)</p>
<p>Notably, there are contexts in which M theory exhibits no string-like objects at all. It&#8217;s the same with particles and fields; simple field theories have particles, but most field theories aren&#8217;t simple, and many complicated field theories don&#8217;t have particles. It can happen that the particles that would be observed in experiments may have nothing to do with the fields that appear in the equations of the theory; this was something I alluded to <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part 7)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/11/20/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-7/" target="_blank">in this article</a>. I also earlier <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part 2)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/24/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-2/" target="_blank">described scale-invariant quantum field theories</a>, which don&#8217;t have particles. Quantum field theories on curved space-time don&#8217;t have simple, straightforward notions of particles either. Quantum field theory is complex and rich and subtle, and we don&#8217;t fully understand it; I wrote seven posts about it in this series, and did little more than scratch the surface. String/M theory is even more complicated, so it will surely be quite a while before we understand it. But specifically, what this means is that what I told you <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part 8)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/01/23/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-8/" target="_blank">in my last article</a> about &#8220;simple superstring theories&#8221; is simply not always true. And that means that the first &#8220;<a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part 8)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/01/23/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-8/" target="_blank">vague prediction of string theory</a>&#8221; that I described might not be reliable&#8230; no more than <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part 2)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/24/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-2/" target="_blank">overall predictions of simple field theory</a>, all of which are true in the context of simple field theories, but some of which are often false in more complex ones.</p>
<p>By the way, those of you who&#8217;ve read about string theory may wonder: where is <a title="Supersymmetry" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/" target="_blank">supersymmetry</a> in my discussion? Historically, in all these developments, the mathematics and physics of supersymmetry played an important role in making it <em>easier to study and confirm the existence</em> of these branes within string/M theory. However, the branes are present in the theory even when supersymmetry isn&#8217;t exact. One must not confuse the technically useful role of supersymmetry in clarifying how string/M theory works for a requirement that supersymmetry has to be an exact (or nearly-exact) symmetry for string/M theory to make sense at all. It&#8217;s just a lot harder to study string/M theory in the absence supersymmetry&#8230; something which is also true, though to a somewhat lesser extent, of quantum field theory.</p>
<p><em>To be continued&#8230; next, how are quantum field theory and M theory similar and different?</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last year, <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/23/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions/" target="_blank">in a series of posts</a>, I gave you a tour of quantum field theory, telling you some of what we understand and some of what we don&#8217;t. I still haven&#8217;t told you the role that string theory plays in quantum field theory today, but I am going to give you a brief tour of string theory before I do.</p>
<p><strong>What IS <span style="color:#800080;">String Theory</span>? Well, what&#8217;s <span style="color:#333399;">Particle Theory</span>?</strong></p>
<p>What is particle theory? It&#8217;s nothing other than a theory that describes how particles behave.  And in physics language, <em><strong>a </strong></em><strong>theory</strong><em><strong> is a set of equations, along with a set of rules for how the things in those equations are related to physical objects</strong></em>.  So a particle theory is a set of equations which can be used to make predictions for how particles will behave when they interact with one another.</p>
<p>Now there&#8217;s always space for confusion here, so let&#8217;s be precise about terminology.</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Particle theory&#8221; is the general category of the equations that can describe particles, of any type and in any combination.</li>
<li>&#8220;<strong>A</strong> particle theory&#8221; is a specific example of such equations, describing a specific set of particles of specific types and interacting with each other in specific ways.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, there is a particle theory for electrons in atoms. But we&#8217;d need a different one for atoms with both electrons and muons, or for a bottom quark moving around a bottom anti-quark, even though the equations would be of a quite similar type.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">Most particle theories that one can write down aren&#8217;t relevant (or at least don&#8217;t appear to be relevant) to the real world; they don&#8217;t describe the types of particles (electrons, quarks, etc.) that we find (so far) in our own universe.   Only certain particle theories are needed to describe aspects of our world.  The others describe imaginary particles in imaginary universes, which can be fun, or even informative, to think about.</span></p>
<p>Modern particle theory was invented in the early part of the 20th century in response to &#8212; guess what? &#8212; <em>the discovery of particles in experiments</em>. First the electron was discovered, in 1897; then atomic nuclei, then the proton, then the photon, then the neutrino and the neutron, and so on&#8230; Originally, the mathematics used in particle theory was called &#8220;quantum mechanics&#8221;, a set of equations that is still widely useful today. But it wasn&#8217;t complete enough to describe everything physicists knew about, even at the time. Specifically, it couldn&#8217;t describe particles that move at or near the speed of light&#8230; and so it wasn&#8217;t consistent with Einstein&#8217;s theory (i.e. his equations) of relativity.</p>
<p><strong>What is <span style="color:#008000;">Quantum Field Theory</span>?</strong></p>
<p>To fix this problem, physicists first tried to make a new version of particle theory that was consistent with relativity, but it didn&#8217;t entirely work.  However, it served as an essential building block in their gradual invention of what is called <strong>quantum field theory</strong>, described in much more detail <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/23/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions/" target="_blank">in previous posts, starting here</a>. <em>(Again: the distinction between &#8220;quantum field theory&#8221; and &#8220;a quantum field theory&#8221; is that of the general versus the specific case; see <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part 2)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/24/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-2/" target="_blank">this post for a more detailed discussion of the terminology</a>.)</em></p>
<p>In quantum field theory, fields are the basic ingredients, not particles. Each field takes a value everywhere in space and time, in much the same way that the temperature of the air is something you can specify at all times and at all places in the atmosphere. And in quantum field theory, particles are ripples in these quantum fields.</p>
<p>More precisely, a particle is a ripple of smallest possible intensity (or &#8220;amplitude&#8221;, if you know what that means.)  For example, a photon is the dimmest possible flash of light, and we refer to it as a &#8220;particle&#8221; or &#8220;quantum&#8221; of light.</p>
<p>We call such a &#8220;smallest ripple&#8221; a &#8220;particle&#8221; because in some ways it behaves like a particle; it travels as a unit, and can&#8217;t be divided into pieces.  But really it is wave-like in many ways, and the word &#8220;quantum&#8221; is in some ways better, because it emphasizes that photons and electrons aren&#8217;t like particles of dust.</p>
<p>To sum up:</p>
<ul>
<li>particles were discovered in experiments;</li>
<li>physicists invented the equations of particle theory to describe their behavior;</li>
<li>but to make those equations consistent with Einstein&#8217;s special relativity (needed to describe objects moving near or at the speed of light) they invented the equations of quantum field theory, in which particles are ripples in fields.</li>
<li>in this context the fields are more fundamental than the particles; and indeed it was eventually realized that one could (in principle) <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part 2)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/24/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-2/" target="_blank">have fields without particles</a>, while the reverse is not true in a world with Einstein&#8217;s relativity.</li>
<li>thus, quantum field theory is a more general and complete theory than particle theory; it has other features not seen in particle theory.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Now what about String Theory?</strong></p>
<p>In some sense, strings also emerged from experiments &#8212; experiments on <a title="What’s a Hadron?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-hadron-as-in-large-hadron-collider/">hadrons</a>, back before we knew hadrons were made from quarks and gluons.  The details are a story I&#8217;ll tell soon and in another context. For now, suffice it to say that in the process of trying to explain some puzzling experiments, physicists were led to invent some new equations, which, after some study, were recognized to be <em>equations describing the quantum mechanical behavior of strings</em>, just as the equations of particle theory describe the quantum mechanical behavior of particles.  (One advantage of the string equations, however, is that they were, from the start, consistent with Einstein&#8217;s relativity.) Naturally, at that point, this class of equations was named &#8220;string theory&#8221;.<span id="more-7082"></span></p>
<p><em>An aside: theories of <strong>non-relativistic</strong> strings have appeared in the literature, for instance in <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0212061" target="_blank">Gimon et al. from 2002</a>.  There must be earlier versions, but I haven&#8217;t found them.  [Experts will think of light-cone gauge.]</em></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">A few more years of study of these equations led to a number of realizations about the simplest forms of string theory.  Note my use of the vague term </span><em style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;">&#8220;simplest forms&#8221;</em><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">.  I&#8217;ve used this to alert you that what I&#8217;m about to say about string theory is not always true.  </span><em style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;">It is true of what people knew about string theory back in 1985 or so.</em><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">  But keep in mind <strong><em>this is not the final word on what &#8220;string theory&#8221; means;</em></strong> it was, rather, just the first attempt.  I&#8217;ll make this concept much less vague in <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part 9)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/02/26/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-9/" target="_blank">my next post</a>.</span></p>
<p>Anyway, here are some things that people learned about this theory in the 1970s and 1980s, presented in a somewhat ahistorical order.</p>
<p>Just as particles are ripples in fields, strings can be seen as a sort of ripple in string fields. (See Figure 1.) But unlike particle theory, which is actually incomplete unless one takes a field point of view, the mathematics of the string equations make it easier to understand strings on their own, without the use of string fields. And string field theory is very complicated, and still very poorly understood even today. This is part of why, for strings, people usually talk about &#8220;string theory&#8221; and not &#8220;string field theory&#8221;, while for particles, people usually talk about &#8220;field theory&#8221;, not &#8220;particle theory&#8221;.</p>

<p>In its simplest context, a theory of strings is equivalent to a theory of a huge number of fields and their particles. Roughly, even though there&#8217;s only one type of string, a string can move or vibrate in different ways.  A string vibrating in one way will appear in an experiment as though it is one type of particle; a string vibrating in a different way will appear to be a different particle.  In short, <strong><em>a <span style="color:#ff0000;">single</span> type of string, though so small it seems like a particle in current experiments, has <span style="color:#993366;">many</span> types of vibrations, and these would appear in current experiments to be <span style="color:#993366;">many</span> types of particles</em></strong>.  See Figure 2.  The masses and other properties of these particles, and the forces by which they interact with each other, are arranged in special patterns, a point I&#8217;ll return to in a moment.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;">The simplest string theories have only <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/fermions-and-bosons/" target="_blank">boson</a> particles (particles which, like Higgs particles, photons and gravitons, have spin = 0,1,2&#8230;). The next simplest are superstring theories, which also have <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/fermions-and-bosons/" target="_blank">fermion</a> particles (which have spin 1/2, 3/2, &#8230;; electrons and quarks have spin 1/2.)  To describe our world, then, superstrings are necessary.</span></p>
<p>Moreover, for a theory of strings to be consistent and stable (remember a theory is a set of equations &#8212; it has to make mathematical sense, or you can&#8217;t use it to make predictions of any sort) the strings have to be superstrings, at least approximately.</p>
<p>In addition, for a theory of superstrings to be consistent, the strings have to <em>[with a few subtle caveats]</em> move in <em>a space with 9 spatial dimensions</em>.  That is, adding on <em>time</em> as one more dimension, they can exist only in universes with <em>a total of 10 space-time dimensions</em>.  That sounds bad&#8230; but it isn&#8217;t.  It might be that only a few of those dimensions are like the ones we know; the others might be so short that we might not notice them, much as a sheet of paper appears two-dimensional if you don&#8217;t notice its thickness (Figure 3).  So our world could be described by string theory as long as there are six unseen &#8220;extra dimensions&#8221;, which are too short for us to detect with current experiments.</p>

<p>In a (simple) superstring theory which describes a world similar to the one we live in, with three very large spatial dimensions, the pattern of masses for the particles in that universe would be something vaguely like that shown in Figure 4.  There would be huge numbers of types of heavy particles, with masses so large that we aren&#8217;t even close to producing them in our experiments, and in the near term we have no hope of checking whether they can exist. Only a small number of types of particles, massless or with rather small masses, will be easily observable.  These include (Figure 4)</p>
<ul>
<li>particles and fields similar in type, though with details that may vary widely, to those that we find in the Standard Model of particle physics (the quantum field theory that describes the known particles and non-gravitational forces.)   The equations that describe them would be those of quantum field theory.</li>
<li>a graviton: a spin-two particle that is a ripple in a gravitational field.  The equations for this field are those of Einstein&#8217;s general relativity, in which gravity is an effect of the curvature of space and time.  But these equations are generalized into a quantum mechanical form, which we call &#8220;quantum gravity&#8221;.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me say that again, because <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>it&#8217;s a prediction</strong></span> &#8212; not a hugely impressive one, because it is vague and after-the-fact, but nevertheless, something deserving of the name.</p>

<p><strong>String Theory&#8217;s First Prediction (Vague, and with  Loopholes) </strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;">In its simplest forms, string theory, at least naively,</span><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;"><span style="color:#800000;"> predicts that in a universe whose basic objects are superstrings, one will probably observe a <strong>quantum</strong> version of something similar to (and possibly identical to) <strong>Einstein&#8217;s vision of gravity</strong>, and probably other very lightweight and massless particles not entirely dissimilar from the ones we observe, along with additional forces like the ones we observe&#8230; all of which can be described using <strong>quantum field theory</strong>.</span> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">Now this is a remarkable prediction of the theory [again, I remind you, of the theory <em>in its simplest form</em>, i.e. as it was understood in 1985], because <strong>this prediction agrees with data</strong>.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">But how excited should we be about this success?  The prediction is quite vague; it&#8217;s analogous to the fact that (as <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/24/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-2/" target="_blank">I explained here</a>) the simplest forms of quantum field theory (before you choose a particular example) make only a few, very vague, predictions: that there will be particles in the world; these will be fermions or bosons; and any two particles of the same type will be literally identical.  This prediction of string theory is <strong>so</strong> vague that its success is hardly convincing; one could imagine there are lots of other theories out there that predict the same thing.  And just as complicated quantum field theories don&#8217;t always have particles, this simple prediction isn&#8217;t necessarily true when string theory gets complicated.</span></p>
<p>Furthermore, it&#8217;s a prediction <em>of something we already knew about the world</em>, which physicists sometimes call a <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>postdiction</strong></span>.  It is a lot easier to make a prediction about nature when you already know what the answer has to be!  An example of a postdiction is Einstein&#8217;s calculation that his theory of general relativity, which he was developing at the time, predicted the small observed shift in Mercury&#8217;s orbit.  The shift was already known from data, so he had a target to aim at&#8230; and that&#8217;s part of why people were mildly impressed (his theory could have failed at this step by giving the wrong answer) but hardly convinced.  It was (and is) much more impressive that the theory correctly <strong>pre</strong>dicted things that had never previously been observed &#8212; the deflection of light by the sun, the gravitational slowing-down of clocks, the gravitational redshift of light, energy loss by radiation of gravitational waves, etc.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;">But historically and sociologically, this first prediction of string theory was a very important one.  People had been trying for many years to find a quantum theory of gravity that would also be consistent with the quantum field theories used to describe other particles&#8230; or perhaps something more general that would contain both Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity and the quantum field theory that describes the other forces and particles.  It was a sort of &#8220;holy grail&#8221;, one that Einstein himself spent his last 30 years seeking fruitlessly.  So you have to understand that </span><span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>it was quite remarkable that a theory of strings, once the equations were worked out carefully, simply dumped the holy grail on the table without anyone asking or looking for it to do so.  </em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;">Of course, we didn&#8217;t and still don&#8217;t know it is the <em>only</em> holy grail; maybe there are others.  But at worst, a simple form of superstring theory is a very interesting example of how a quantum theory containing both gravity and field theory might work!<span style="color:#ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration:line-through;"><br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p><strong>Is Our World a World of Strings?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;">In short, back when physicists were still new to string theory, they found that simple forms of string theory could potentially describe universes much like the one we live in. And this fact generated a lot of optimism that maybe there is a string theory that describes our <em>own</em> universe.  But if so, which one?</span></p>
<p>By 1983, it turned out that most string theories anyone had written down were mathematically inconsistent (or had to be very complicated to make them consistent), <strong>but not all of them</strong>. A short list of 5 simple superstring theories survived all mathematical requirements, and only one seemed relevant for our own universe.  I&#8217;ll say a bit more about them in my next post.  And since there was only one of these that seemed directly relevant, a huge wave of over-optimism swept across the string theory experts <em>[I was an undergraduate, watching with some skepticism, at the time]</em> that they were on the verge of figuring out <strong>the complete theory of elementary particles, forces and space-time.</strong></p>
<p><em>I should note that at this same time the string theory folks took the unfortunate step of annoying all the other physicists, along with chemists, biologists, social scientists of all sorts, artists, writers, lawyers, and chefs by calling this potentially complete theory of particles, forces and spacetime a &#8220;Theory of Everything&#8221;.  We won&#8217;t use that term here.</em></p>
<p><strong>But This Was Just The Beginning of a Saga</strong></p>
<p>Let me pause at this moment to make some important cautionary remarks.</p>
<p>Up to this point, the methods that people had used to study string theories were of a similar type used (as <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/01/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-3/" target="_blank">I described here</a>) in the simplest quantum field theories. This is a method known as &#8220;perturbation theory&#8221;, which is a technique of successive approximation: the full calculation is written as a simple estimate, plus a small but more complicated correction to the estimate, plus a smaller but even more complicated correction to the correction&#8230; etc.</p>
<p>The problem is that &#8212; just as in quantum field theory &#8212; successive approximation only works when all relevant forces are relatively weak (in a technical sense &#8212; <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-forces-of-nature/the-strength-of-the-known-forces/" target="_blank">see this post</a>). But there are some questions in string theory &#8212; most notably, how does the world end up with 3 large spatial dimensions rather than 9? and why don&#8217;t the strengths of all forces end up being zero? &#8212; for which the method of successive approximation is not good enough. When this was realized in the mid-1980s, progress in string theory slowed down markedly, and the goal of a complete theory of particles, forces and space-time receded for the moment.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, some experts continued to explore string theory, and made slow but steady progress.  And then, spurred in part by advances in quantum field theory in 1993-1994, a major set of realizations occurred in string theory studies during the period 1994-1998. By the time that mini-revolution was over, what string theorists knew about this theory had dramatically expanded and changed. And that will be the subject of <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part 9)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/02/26/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-9/" target="_blank">my next post in this series</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<pre><span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>Appro</em><em>priate for Advanced Non-Experts</em></span></pre>
<p><em>[This is the seventh post in a series that begins <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/23/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions/">here</a>.]</em></p>
<p>In <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part 6)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/11/06/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-6/" target="_blank">the last post in this series</a>, I pointed out that there&#8217;s a lot about quantum field theory [the general case] that we don&#8217;t understand.  In particular there are many specific quantum field theories whose behavior we cannot calculate, and others whose existence we&#8217;re only partly sure of, since we can&#8217;t even write down equations for them. And I concluded with the remark that part of the reason we know about this last case is due to &#8220;supersymmetry&#8221;.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the role of supersymmetry here? Most of the time you read about <a title="Supersymmetry — What Is It?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/supersymmetry-what-is-it/" target="_blank">supersymmetry</a> in the press, and on this website, it&#8217;s about the possible role of supersymmetry in addressing <a title="Naturalness and the Standard Model" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/naturalness/" target="_blank">the naturalness problem of the Standard Model</a> [which overlaps with and is almost identical to <a title="The Hierarchy Problem" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/" target="_blank">the hierarchy problem</a>.] But actually (and I speak from personal experience here) one of the most powerful uses of supersymmetry has nothing to do with the naturalness problem at all.</p>
<p>The point is that <em><strong>quantum field theories that have supersymmetry are mathematically simpler than those that don&#8217;t</strong></em>. For certain physical questions &#8212; not all questions, by any means, but for some of the most interesting ones &#8212; it is sometimes possible to solve their equations exactly. And this makes it possible to learn far more about these quantum field theories than about their non-supersymmetric cousins.</p>
<p>Who cares? you might ask. Since supersymmetry isn&#8217;t part of the real world in our experiments, it seems of no use to study supersymmetric quantum field theories.</p>
<p>But that view would be deeply naive. It&#8217;s naive for three reasons.<span id="more-6913"></span></p>
<p>1. Supersymmetric quantum field theories <strong>might</strong> be directly important in the real world. We don&#8217;t know that the world isn&#8217;t supersymmetric at shorter distances and higher energies than we can currently measure. We need to be able to calculate properties of supersymmetric quantum field theories <em><strong>so that we could recognize them for what they are</strong></em>, should experiments someday give us evidence for them.</p>
<p>2. Supersymmetric quantum field theories can give us <strong>analogies</strong> for aspects of the real world that we know about but don&#8217;t understand very well. The imaginary worlds that are described by certain supersymmetric quantum field theories sometimes bear a certain resemblance to the real world. Consequently it is sometimes possible <em><strong>to gain insights into the real world</strong></em> by studying these imaginary worlds&#8230; remembering that our understanding of the Standard Model is imperfect, because of the difficulty of working with its equations.</p>
<p>3. Supersymmetry enables us to discover entirely <strong>new features</strong> of quantum field theory that we did not know about, and that might be true of some non-supersymmetric theories too &#8212; and these too could be part of the real world. Remember the structure and features of the Standard Model, a rather complicated theory with many loose ends, still poses many puzzles for particle physicists. We don&#8217;t understand the number or strengths of the forces; we don&#8217;t understand why the particles come in the number they do and why their masses have the pattern that we observe; and there is the naturalness problem, among others. The imaginary worlds that are described by supersymmetric quantum field theories have a variety of interesting general features. Although supersymmetry was useful in making it possible for us to discover those features, some of those features are probably also true of non-supersymmetric quantum field theories for which we can&#8217;t calculate anything. So any one of these features <em><strong>might be an as-yet unknown aspect of the real world</strong></em>, even if the real world does not have supersymmetry at all.</p>
<p>So let me tell you a little about supersymmetry.</p>
<p><strong>Supersymmetry: Some Basics</strong></p>
<p>In a world with three spatial dimensions like ours, supersymmetric quantum field theory comes in three varieties</p>
<ul>
<li>maximal supersymmetry</li>
<li>half-maximal supersymmetry</li>
<li>minimal supersymmetry</li>
</ul>
<p>Technically these are called N=4, N=2 and N=1 supersymmetry. <em>[There&#8217;s no N=3 because consistency requirements turn it back into N=4. Supergravity can go up to N=8, but that&#8217;s another story. With more or fewer spatial dimensions, the details are different.]  </em>These were discovered in the 1970s.</p>
<p>The more supersymmetry a quantum field theory has, the simpler the required mathematics becomes, and the more things about the quantum field theory that can be calculated. The calculations in question aren&#8217;t done using methods that I&#8217;ve described so far (<a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part 3)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/01/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-3/" target="_blank">successive approximation</a> and <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part 4)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/07/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-4/" target="_blank">computer simulation</a>); they&#8217;re done using fancier mathematics that takes full advantage of the simpler equations. <em>[For non-supersymmetric theories, no known fancy math can be used; we may well need even fancier mathematics that hasn&#8217;t yet been invented, but at this point we&#8217;re almost powerless.]</em></p>
<p>However, the more supersymmetry a quantum field theory has, the more remote it becomes from the real world. As I mentioned, the real world <em>might</em> have minimal supersymmetry, hidden from us but actually present, though so far that hasn&#8217;t been discovered to be the case. It is unlikely (but not impossible) that some form of half-maximal or maximal supersymmetry has a partial, complicated and subtle role to play in the real world, but that&#8217;s a much more complex issue than I want to cover here. Let&#8217;s just say that <em><strong>maximal supersymmetry has no simple and direct possible role in the real world, whereas minimal supersymmetry may perhaps have such a role.</strong></em></p>

<p>Yet maximal and half-maximal supersymmetric quantum field theories have proven very useful in learning about the real world. And they&#8217;ve proven extremely useful in learning about minimal supersymmetric quantum field theories, which in turn (a) <strong>might</strong> be directly relevant in the real world, and (b) have been somewhat useful in learning about non-supersymmetric quantum field theories, which are <em><strong>definitely</strong></em> relevant in the real world.</p>
<p>So what kind of things can we gain from supersymmetry?</p>
<p><strong>Learning Lessons From Supersymmetry</strong></p>
<p>1) <strong><em>Supersymmetry has made it easier to make particle physics predictions in non-supersymmetric theories.</em></strong></p>
<p>In supersymmetric theories, the <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part 3)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/01/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-3/" target="_blank">method of successive approximation</a> (or &#8220;perturbation theory&#8221;, in jargonese) is simpler. It turns out that one of the best ways to do successive approximation in the Standard Model &#8212; a somewhat complicated non-supersymmetric quantum field theory (QFT) &#8212; is</p>
<p>a) do a similar calculation in a maximally supersymmetric QFT<br />
b) do a similar calculation in a minimally supersymmetric QFT<br />
c) do a similar calculation in a simple non-supersymmetric QFT<br />
d) add them up, with appropriate care</p>
<p>More generally, the structure of calculations in non-supersymmetric theories can be broken up into parts that already appear in supersymmetric theories (and these are relatively easy to calculate) and parts that are special to the non-supersymmetric case (which can be studied in the simplest possible contexts.) In short, supersymmetry gives us a useful way of organizing our real-world calculations, so that the simple parts are separated out and done first, and then the small number of hard parts can be focused on.</p>
<p>This is also the logic and strategy behind the now-(in)famous &#8220;amplitu-hedron&#8221; method that received <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/quanta/20130917-a-jewel-at-the-heart-of-quantum-physics/" target="_blank">a very enthusiastic press article</a> recently.  The article was certainly over the top &#8212; and the title, &#8220;A Jewel at the Heart of Physics&#8221;, was a bit misleading. It should have been entitled &#8220;A Jewel at the Heart of <strong>Maximally Supersymmetric</strong> Physics&#8221;, since &#8212; so far &#8212; the details have been most clear for maximal supersymmetric quantum field theories, which have very special features and are far from the real world. But, as I said above, <em>understanding the maximally supersymmetric case can be step one, with minimally supersymmetric theories to come next, and non-supersymmetric ones to come last but not least</em>. So it&#8217;s early days for the amplitu-hedron, and too early to declare joy and rapture as loudly as did the press article about it all, but there is good reason for cautious optimism that these breakthroughs in maximally supersymmetric contexts will affect calculations in the real world within the next decade.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">2) </span><em style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;"><strong>Supersymmetry has taught us that the effective field theory that describes the low-energy and long-distance behavior of a quantum field theory can have features which we&#8217;ve not encountered &#8212; yet &#8212; in the real world.</strong></em></p>
<p>In a previous post I emphasized that in the strong nuclear force, the<a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part 5)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/28/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-5/" target="_blank"> effective field theory for the low-mass hadrons</a> (pions and kaons) is a useful tool, but that its form had to be guessed &#8212; we can&#8217;t, even today, determine the equations for the effective quantum field theory from the quantum field theory of the strong nuclear force. The only way to figure out the right theory is to guess it starting from data. Well, in supersymmetric quantum field theories, using methods developed in the 90s (which in turn were founded on earlier work from the 80s), we often can determine the right effective quantum field theory to a greater or lesser degree, starting with the equations of the original theory! There&#8217;s still often some guesswork involved, but the math often provides the clues we need.</p>
<p>For instance, take <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part 4)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/07/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-4/">the imaginary world that we use for calculation of the strong nuclear force</a>, with three low-mass quarks and eight gluons, carrying three types of color) The supersymmetric version of this world (see Figure 2) has a superpartner particles for the quarks and for the gluons.  And at long-distance and low-energy, it has pion-like and proton-like hadrons, for which an effective quantum field theory can be written down. The power of supersymmetry opens up the door to an understanding of many features of these theories, not just the ones I&#8217;ve mentioned here.</p>

But also, changing the number of quarks and squarks from 3 to 4 or 5 results in major changes to those phenomena.</p></div>
<p>And in the process of learning how to do this, we also learned that quantum field theory can do many things that we didn&#8217;t previously know it could do. The initial wave of major discoveries about this were launched by the work in 1994 of Seiberg and Witten for half-maximal and maximal supersymmetric QFTs, and of Seiberg in minimal supersymmetric QFTs. I can tell you from having been there when it all was happening &#8212; these were heady days, where major insights into what quantum field theory was capable of were appearing every few weeks. [And then string theory got into the act, but that&#8217;s another story.]</p>
<p>For instance, we learned that the low-energy physics of a quantum field theory can involve gluon-like and quark-like particles that are neither some of the quarks and gluons of the original theory, nor made in a simple sense out of the quarks and gluons of the original theory. (This is in contrast to protons of the real world, which we understand as being made directly out of quarks and gluons.) They are, so to speak, &#8220;emergent&#8221;, arising in a complex and subtle way that even today we don&#8217;t entirely understand.  See point (4) below.</p>
<p>By the way, curiously, computer simulations, such as are used for <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part 4)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/07/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-4/">understanding the strong nuclear force,</a> are not useful here! Supersymmetry is a complete disaster for computer simulations; the methods we have for simulating quantum field theories using computers do not work at all in the presence of supersymmetry.  This is a very frustrating situation, but no one, despite years of work (and some very, very clever ideas) has yet crossed this barrier.</p>
<p>3) <em><strong>Study of supersymmetric quantum field theories has taught us that scale-invariant quantum field theories are far more common than we previously thought.</strong></em></p>
<p>Thanks to the work of Seiberg, considerable evidence was obtained in the mid-90s that even for minimal supersymmetry, <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part 2)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/24/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-2/" target="_blank">scale-invariant quantum field theories</a> are very common. (A few such theories were known in the 70s, and more in the 80s, but they weren&#8217;t considered typical.)  For instance, <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part 6)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/11/06/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-6/" target="_blank">I emphasized</a> that we have no idea how a quantum field theory like the real-world strong nuclear force, but with, say, 8 types of low-mass quarks, behaves when the forces become truly strong. Well, the supersymmetric version of this theory &#8212; with gluons and their superpartner particles (gluinos), along with 8 massless types of quarks and their superpartner particles (squarks) &#8212; turns out to be a scale-invariant theory at long distance. The supersymmetric version of <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part 6)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/11/06/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-6/" target="_blank">the theory with a half-sextet and 7 half-quarks</a>, is also scale-invariant, as we learned from Seiberg&#8217;s student Pouliot. Many properties of these theories can be calculated.</p>
<p>Today, thanks to these insights, it is widely believed that even <em>non-supersymmetric</em> scale-invariant quantum field theories are very common. This belief has motivated people to <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part 6)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/11/06/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-6/" target="_blank">study the question using computers</a>, and though the jury is still out, some evidence has already been obtained.</p>
<p>4) <em><strong>Often, two quantum field theories with entirely different fields are actually the same &#8212; sometimes exactly the same, and other times having the same long-distance low-energy behavior.</strong></em></p>
<p>This phenomenon, known often as &#8220;duality&#8221; <em>(but be careful, because the word &#8220;duality&#8221; is heavily over-used, and means different things in different contexts, even within physics)</em>, is one that deserves its own article. But suffice it to say that two (and sometimes more) quantum field theories, with entirely different sets of fields and entirely different equations, can sometimes have identical physical phenomena &#8212; depending on context, this may mean &#8220;exactly identical&#8221; or &#8220;identical only for low-energy and long-distance behavior&#8221;. Famous names associated with these developments, which go back to the 70s but became clear and widespread in the 90s, are Olive, Montonen, Sen, Seiberg, Witten; less famous names include yours truly and many others.</p>

<p>In fact, this is a grand generalization of the notion of <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part 5)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/28/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-5/">effective field theories</a>. An effective field theory is a quantum field theory whose equations may be used to describe the low-energy and long-distance phenomena of another quantum field theory. As occurs in the case of the strong nuclear force, the original theory and the effective field theory may have completely different fields and equations. For the strong nuclear force, <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part 5)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/28/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-5/" target="_blank">the &#8220;original&#8221; theory is the theory of quark and gluon fields; the effective theory is a theory of pion and kaon fields, which describe the hadrons made from quarks and gluons</a>. But the more general notion of duality is somewhat mind-blowing.  Rather than the second set of fields being made out of the first set in the way a house is made from bricks, as for hadrons and quarks, it may happen that neither set of fields is made from the other in any simple-to-describe way.</p>
<p>5) <strong><em>Supersymmetry has allowed us to learn that there are quantum field theories for which no normal-looking equations can be written.</em></strong></p>
<p>While using fancy mathematics to explore the various quantum field theories with half-maximal and minimal supersymmetry, some of my colleagues (initially Philip Argyres and Michael Douglas, but many more followed) came across theories whose properties simply aren&#8217;t consistent with any type of equations that we know how to write down.</p>
<p>Some clever trickery is required to find these things. In supersymmetric contexts, sometimes it is easier to figure out the answers to certain physical questions not by directly solving the equations that we use in quantum field theory but by an indirect route, using fancy math. The answers one obtains in this way suggest that certain quantum field theories that we didn&#8217;t know about not only exist but have properties that are clearly inconsistent with the types of quantum field theory equations that we normally write down. (For example, we learned of quantum field theories whose symmetries could never arise from ordinary quantum field theory equations.) In particular, such theories cannot be even partially specified by what fields they have. This tells us that we&#8217;ve somehow been too narrow-minded, and there must be ways of defining quantum field theories using methods with which we&#8217;re currently unfamiliar.</p>
<p>What we know about this subject may be just the tip of a large proverbial iceberg. We know there are many of these theories, but we may not have identified the majority of them, or understood anything about what makes them special. Although the ones we know about are supersymmetric, there is absolutely no reason to think there aren&#8217;t non-supersymmetric ones too.</p>
<p><strong>A Moral</strong></p>
<p>From this story, I hope you can get some insight into why particle physicists spend a lot of time thinking about imaginary worlds.  First, certain imaginary worlds might actually turn out to be real; second, what happens in an imaginary world may be analogous to, but easier to study than, what happens in the real world; and third, imaginary worlds may reveal phenomena that we never previously thought of and might be relevant for solving real-world puzzles.</p>
<p>The developments of the past 20 years have given us great insight into how quantum field theory works, thanks in large part to what we&#8217;ve been able to learn about supersymmetric theories, which are simpler to understand. It may turn out that supersymmetry has nothing to do with particle physics at the LHC, and the solution to the naturalness problem of the Standard Model. But for understanding how quantum field theory works overall, this is beside the point: supersymmetry <strong>as a tool for studying quantum field theory</strong> is here to stay. As a teacher of quantum field theory, I will say this: <strong><em>anyone wanting to understand quantum field theory fully <span style="color:#ff0000;">must</span> study supersymmetry.</em></strong> It&#8217;s not optional.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#000000;">As I think most of us in the field expected, professor Alexander Polyakov was selected from among the nominees as the winner of  a <del>cool $3 million check</del>  <a href="http://www.fundamentalphysicsprize.org/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#000000;">Fundamental Physics Prize</span></a> today. <span id="more-5711"></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Polyakov (who has spent the last two decades at Princeton University; the average wealth in that town has increased slightly in the last two years) is legendary for his wide-ranging contributions to theoretical physics, and he is certainly deserving of some fame outside the physics community.  We owe him a great deal for our understanding of many aspects of quantum field theory (the mathematical technology used in the so-called Standard Model to describe the <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#000000;">known elementary particles and forces</span></a><em></em>, and also used widely in the physics of solids, in string theory, and elsewhere.)  Much of his work, starting in the 1960s and 1970s, and continuing to the present, allowed quantum field theorists to study, understand and/or discover crucially important phenomena which cannot be explored using the famous but quite limited methods of &#8220;perturbation theory&#8221;, of which Feynman diagrams are an example.  His name or initial appears on many objects and phenomena of importance in physics (&#8216;t Hooft-Polyakov magnetic monopoles, Polyakov loops, BPST instantons, BPZ conformal blocks, and so on); you&#8217;ll find his name in the <strong>title</strong> of over 500 papers.  He was perhaps the first person to show that if string theory and quantum field theory were somehow equivalent (an idea that goes back to the 1970s) then the string theory would have more spatial dimensions than the field theory does &#8212; a notion that was eventually explicitly realized in the AdS/CFT (or &#8220;gauge/string&#8221;) correspondence for which Juan Maldacena is famous.  (The two next papers on that subject, appearing almost simultaneously following Maldacena&#8217;s 1997 work, were one by Witten and one by Gubser, Klebanov and&#8230; Polyakov.) He even did some work relevant for the current Higgs excitement, back in the 1960s.  I cannot hope to convey how much I have learned about quantum field theory from his papers.  In short: hearty congratulations to Professor Polyakov!</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">NOTE ADDED: I have noticed that a number of people are referring to Professor Polyakov as a &#8220;string theorist&#8221;.  Perhaps this was inevitable, given the politics of the field and of the relevant blogs, but it greatly diminishes Polyakov&#8217;s work to reduce him to a single label.  Yes, he did some of the most foundational work in string theory.  But that&#8217;s not all, by any means; many of his most famous and lasting contributions lie outside of string theory, addressing basic issues in quantum field theories (magnetic monopoles, quantum tunneling [&#8220;instantons&#8221;], phase transitions) that are or could well be relevant in the Standard Model and/or in some of its possible extensions, such as Grand Unification.  And even many of his contributions to string theory involved very fundamental issues in quantum field theory which have application outside of string theory as well (properties of scale-invariant [technically, &#8220;conformally&#8221; invariant] theories.)   In short, his work is important to all people who use quantum field theory, including but not limited to string theorists, and he deserves the highest respect for his contributions to our understanding of some very subtle aspects of our world.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Just to drive the point home, I&#8217;d like to quote from <a href="http://quantumfrontiers.com/2012/12/11/fundamental-physics-prize-prediction-polyakov/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#000000;">Caltech Professor John Preskill&#8217;s post from last December</span></a>, describing Polyakov; Preskill is about 15 years older than I am.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><em>&#8220;I have never gotten to know Sasha Polyakov well, but like all theoretical physicists of my generation I hold him in awe. When I was a graduate student in the late 1970s, there were two great physicists who seemed to be leading most of the great advances in quantum field theory: Polyakov and <a href="http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/%7Ehooft101/"><span style="color:#000000;">Gerard ‘t  Hooft</span></a>&#8230;. What those two achieved in the 70s and early 80s is truly astonishing.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><em>There are close parallels in the work of ‘t Hooft and Polyakov. They independently discovered that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%27t_Hooft%E2%80%93Polyakov_monopole"><span style="color:#000000;">magnetic monopoles</span></a> arise as solitons in spontaneously broken gauge theories. Both made fundamental contributions to our understanding of the role of quantum tunneling (“<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instanton"><span style="color:#000000;">instantons</span></a>“) in quantum field theory, and  recognized that quark confinement hinges on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_vortex"><span style="color:#000000;">topology</span></a> of gauge fields. Aside from all that, Polyakov launched the path integral approach to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyakov_action"><span style="color:#000000;">string theory in non-critical dimensions</span></a>, and  laid out the formalism of <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/055032138490052X"><span style="color:#000000;">two-dimensional conformal field theory</span></a>, a contribution just as seminal in condensed matter physics as in particle theory.&#8221;</em></span></p>
