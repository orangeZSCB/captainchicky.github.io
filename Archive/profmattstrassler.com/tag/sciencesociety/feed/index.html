										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Last Thursday, <a href="https://muon-g-2.fnal.gov/">an experiment reported</a> that the magnetic properties of the muon, the electron&#8217;s middleweight cousin, are a tiny bit different from what particle physics equations say they should be.  All around the world, the headlines screamed: <strong>PHYSICS IS BROKEN!!!</strong> And indeed, it&#8217;s been pretty shocking to physicists everywhere. For instance, my equations are working erratically; many of the calculations I tried this weekend came out upside-down or backwards.  Even worse, my stove froze my coffee instead of heating it, I just barely prevented my car from floating out of my garage into the trees, and my desk clock broke and spilled time all over the floor.  What a mess!</p>



<p>&#8212;</p>



<p>Broken, eh?  When we say a coffee machine or a computer is broken, it means it doesn&#8217;t work. It&#8217;s unavailable until it&#8217;s fixed.  When a glass is broken, it&#8217;s shattered into pieces.  We need a new one. I know it&#8217;s cute to say that so-and-so&#8217;s video &#8220;broke the internet.&#8221;  But aren&#8217;t we going a little too far now?  Nothing&#8217;s broken about physics; it works just as well today as it did a month ago.</p>



<p>More reasonable headlines have suggested that &#8220;the laws of physics have been broken&#8221;. That&#8217;s better; I know what it means to break a law.  (Though the metaphor is imperfect, since if I were to break a state law, I&#8217;d be punished, whereas if an object were to break a fundamental law of physics, that law would have to be revised!)  But as is true in the legal system, not all physics laws, and not all violations of law, are equally significant.  </p>



<p>What&#8217;s a physics law, anyway? Crudely, physics is a strategy for making predictions about the behavior of physical objects, based on a set of equations <em>and</em> a conceptual framework for using those equations.  Sometimes we refer to the equations as laws; sometimes parts of the conceptual framework are referred to that way.  </p>



<p>But that story has layers.   Physics has an underlying conceptual foundation, which includes the pillar of quantum physics and its view of reality, and the pillar of Einstein&#8217;s relativity and its view of space and time.  (There are other pillars too, such as those of statistical mechanics, but let me not complicate the story now.) That foundation supports many research areas of physics.  Within particle physics itself, these two pillars are combined into a more detailed framework, with concepts and equations that go by the name of &#8220;quantum effective field theory&#8221; (&#8220;QEFT&#8221;).  But QEFT is still very <strong>general</strong>; this framework can describe an enormous number of possible universes, most with completely different particles and forces from the ones we have in our own universe.  We can start making predictions for real-world experiments only when we put the electron, the muon, the photon, and all the other familiar particles and forces into our equations, building up a <strong>specific</strong> example of a QEFT known as &#8220;<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/">The Standard Model of particle physics</a>.&#8221;  </p>



<p>All along the way there are equations and rules that you might call &#8220;laws.&#8221;  They too come in layers.  The Standard Model itself, as a specific QEFT, has few high-level laws: there are no principles telling us why quarks exist, why there is one type of photon rather than two, or why the weak nuclear force is so weak.  The few laws it does have are mostly low-level, true of our universe but not essential to it.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m bringing attention to these layers because an experiment might cause a problem for one layer but not another.   I think you could only fairly suggest that &#8220;physics is broken&#8221; if data were putting a foundational pillar of the entire field into question.  And to say &#8220;the laws of physics have been violated&#8221;, emphasis on the word &#8220;<strong>the</strong>&#8220;, is a bit melodramatic if the only thing that&#8217;s been violated is a low-level, dispensable law.</p>



<p>&#8212;</p>



<p>Has physics, as a whole, <strong>ever</strong> broken?  You could argue that Newton&#8217;s 17th century foundation, which underpinned the next two centuries of physics, broke at the turn of the 20th century.   Just after 1900, Newton-style equations had to be replaced by equations of a substantially different type; the ways physicists used the equations changed, and the concepts, the language, and even the goals of physics changed. For instance, in Newtonian physics, you can predict the outcome of any experiment, at least in principle; in post-Newtonian quantum physics, you often can only predict the probability for one or another outcome, even in principle. And in Newtonian physics we all agree what time it is; in Einsteinian physics, different observers experience time differently and there is no universal clock that we all agree on.  These were immense changes in the foundation of the field.</p>



<p>Conversely, you could also argue that physics didn&#8217;t break; it was just remodeled and expanded.  No one who&#8217;d been studying steam engines or wind erosion or electrical circuit diagrams had to throw out their books and start again from scratch.  In fact this &#8220;broken&#8221; Newtonian physics is still taught in physics classes, and many physicists and engineers never use anything else.  If you&#8217;re studying the physics of weather, or building a bridge, Newtonian physics is just fine. The fact that Newton-style equations are an <strong>incomplete</strong> description of the world &#8212; that there are phenomena they can&#8217;t describe properly &#8212; doesn&#8217;t invalidate them when they&#8217;re applied within their wheelhouse.</p>



<p>No matter which argument you prefer, it&#8217;s hard to see how to justify the phrase &#8220;physics is broken&#8221; without a profound revolution that overthrows foundational concepts.  It&#8217;s rare for a serious threat to foundations to arise suddenly, because few experiments can single-handedly put fundamental principles at risk.  <em>[The infamous case of the &#8220;faster-than-light neutrinos&#8221; provides an exception.  Had that experiment been correct, it would have invalidated Einstein&#8217;s relativity principles. But few of us were surprised when <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/neutrinos-faster-than-light/opera-what-went-wrong/">a glaring error turned up</a>.]</em></p>



<p>&#8212;</p>



<p>In the Standard Model, the electron, muon and tau particles (known as the &#8220;charged leptons&#8221;) are all identical except for their masses. <em>(More fundamentally, they have different interactions with <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/">the Higgs field</a>, from which their rest masses arise.)</em>  This almost-identity is sometimes stated as a &#8220;principle of lepton universality.&#8221;  <strong><em>Oh, wow, a principle &#8212; a law!</em></strong>  But here&#8217;s the thing.  Some principles are enormously important; the principles of Einsteinian relativity determine how cause and effect work in our universe, and you can&#8217;t drop them without running into big paradoxes.  Other principles are weak, and could easily be discarded without making a mess of any other part of physics.  The principle of lepton universality is one of these.   In fact, if you extend the Standard Model by adding new particles to its equations, it can be difficult to <em>avoid</em> ruining this fragile principle.  <em>[In a sense, the Higgs field has already violated the principle, but we don&#8217;t hold that against it.]</em></p>



<p>All the fuss is about a new experimental result which confirms an older one and slightly disagrees with the latest theoretical predictions, which are made using the Standard Model&#8217;s equations.  What could be the cause of the discrepancy?  One possibility is that it arises from a previously unknown difference between muons and electrons &#8212; from a violation of the principle of lepton universality.  For those who live and breathe particle physics, breaking lepton universality would be a big deal; there&#8217;d be lots of adventure in trying to figure out which of the many possible extensions of the Standard Model could actually explain what broke this law. That&#8217;s why the scientists involved sound so excited.  </p>



<p>But the failure of  lepton universality wouldn&#8217;t come as a huge surprise. From certain points of view, the surprise is that the principle has survived this long!  Since this low-level law is easily violated, its demise may not lead us to a profound new understanding of the world. It&#8217;s way too early for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/07/science/particle-physics-muon-fermilab-brookhaven.html">headlines that argue that what&#8217;s at stake is the existence of &#8220;forms of matter and energy vital to the nature and evolution of the cosmos.&#8221;</a> No one can say how much is at stake; it might be a lot, or just a little.</p>



<p>In particular, there&#8217;s absolutely <em>no</em> evidence that <strong><em>physics</em></strong> is broken, or even that <strong><em>particle physics</em></strong> is broken.  The pillars of physics and QEFT are not (yet) threatened.  Even to say that &#8220;<strong><em>the Standard Model </em></strong>might be broken&#8221; seems a bit melodramatic to me.  Does adding a new wing to a house require &#8220;breaking&#8221; the house? Typically you can still live in the place while it&#8217;s being extended. The Standard Model&#8217;s many successes suggest that it might survive largely intact as a recognizable part of a larger, more complete set of equations.</p>



<p>In any case, right now it&#8217;s still too early to say <strong>anything</strong> so loudly.  The apparent discrepancy may not survive the heavy scrutiny it is coming under. There&#8217;s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2021/04/08/why-you-should-doubt-new-physics-from-the-latest-muon-g-2-results/?sh=4443b8616c4b">plenty of controversy</a> about the theoretical prediction for muon magnetism; the required calculation is extraordinarily complex, elaborate and difficult.  </p>



<p>So, from my perspective, the headlines of the past week are way over the top.  The idea that a single measurement of the muon&#8217;s magnetism could &#8220;<a href="https://www.livescience.com/muon-wobble-could-break-physics.html">shake physics to its core</a>&#8220;, as claimed in another headline I happened upon, is amusing at best.   Physics, and its older subdisciplines, have over time become very difficult to break, or even shake.  That&#8217;s the way it should be, when science is working properly.  And that&#8217;s why we can safely base the modern global economy on scientific knowledge; it&#8217;s unlikely that a single surprise could instantly invalidate large chunks of its foundation.</p>



<p>Some readers may view the extreme, click-baiting headlines as harmless.  Maybe I&#8217;m overly concerned about them. But don&#8217;t they implicitly suggest that one day we will suddenly find physics &#8220;upended&#8221;, and in need of a complete top-to-bottom overhaul?  To imply physics can &#8220;break&#8221; so easily makes a mockery of science&#8217;s strengths, and obscures the process by which scientific knowledge is obtained.  And how can it be good to claim &#8220;physics is broken&#8221; and &#8220;the laws of physics have been broken&#8221; over and over and over again, in stories that almost never merit that level of hype and eventually turn out to have been much ado about nada?  The constant manufacturing of scientific crisis cannot possibly be lost on readers, who I suspect are becoming increasingly jaded.   At some point readers may become as skeptical of science journalism, and the science it describes, as they are of advertising; <em>it&#8217;s all lies, so <strong>caveat emptor</strong></em>.   That&#8217;s not where we want our society to be.  As we are seeing in spades during the current pandemic, there can be serious consequences when &#8220;<strong>TRUST IN SCIENCE IS BROKEN!!!</strong>&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8212;</p>



<p><em>A final footnote: Ironically, the Standard Model itself poses one of the biggest threats to the framework of QEFT. The discovery of the Higgs boson <strong>and nothing else (so far)</strong> at the Large Hadron Collider poses a conceptual challenge &#8212; the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/naturalness/">&#8220;naturalness&#8221; problem</a>. There&#8217;s no sharp paradox, which is why I can&#8217;t promise you that the framework of QEFT will someday break if it isn&#8217;t resolved. But the breakdown of lepton universality might someday <strong>help</strong> solve the naturalness problem, by requiring a more &#8220;natural&#8221; extension of the Standard Model, and thus might actually <strong>save</strong> QEFT instead of &#8220;breaking&#8221; it.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t know what all the fuss is about &#8220;alternative facts.&#8221; Why, we scientists use them all the time!</p>
<p>For example, because of my political views, I teach physics students that gravity pulls down. That&#8217;s why the students I teach, when they go on to be engineers, put wheels on the bottom corners of cars, so that the cars don&#8217;t scrape on the ground. But in some countries, the physicists teach them that gravity pulls whichever way the country&#8217;s leaders instruct it to. That&#8217;s why their engineers build flying carpets as transports for their country&#8217;s troops. It&#8217;s a much more effective way to bring an army into battle, if your politics allows it.  We ought to consider it here.</p>
<p>Another example: in my physics class I claim that energy is &#8220;conserved&#8221; (in the physics sense) &#8212; it is never created out of nothing, nor is it ever destroyed. In our daily lives, energy is taken in with food, converted into special biochemicals for storage, and then used to keep us warm, maintain the pumping of our hearts, allow us to think, walk, breathe &#8212; everything we do. Those are my facts. But in some countries, the facts and laws are different, and energy can be created from nothing. The citizens of those countries never need to eat; it is a wonderful thing to be freed from this requirement. It&#8217;s great for their military, too, to not have to supply food for troops, or fuel for tanks and airplanes and ships. Our only protection against invasion from these countries is that if they crossed our borders they&#8217;d suddenly need fuel tanks.</p>
<p>Facts are what you make them; it&#8217;s entirely up to you. You need a good, well-thought-out system of facts, of course; otherwise they won&#8217;t produce the answers that you want. But just first figure out what you want to be true, and then go out and find the facts that make it true. That&#8217;s the way science has always been done, and the best scientists all insist upon this strategy.  As a simple illustration, compare the photos below.  Which picture has more people in it?   Obviously, the answer depends on what facts you&#8217;ve chosen to use.   [Picture copyright Reuters]  If you can&#8217;t understand that, you&#8217;re not ready to be a serious scientist!</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d44bf9ac740cfa2e4c015e985cf20e4ec8d6fdc9/r=540/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove3/29906170001/201701/2306/29906170001_5290953783001_5290938262001-vs.jpg" /></p>
<p>A third example: when I teach physics to students, I instill in them the notion that quantum mechanics controls the atomic world, and underlies the transistors in every computer and every cell phone. But the uncertainty principle that arises in quantum mechanics just isn&#8217;t acceptable in some countries, so they don&#8217;t factualize it. They don&#8217;t use seditious and immoral computer chips there; instead they use proper vacuum tubes. One curious result is that their computers are the size of buildings. The CDC advises you not to travel to these countries, and certainly not to take electronics with you. Not only might your cell phone explode when it gets there, you yourself might too, since your own molecules are held together with quantum mechanical glue. At least you should bring a good-sized bottle of our local facts with you on your travels, and take a good handful before bedtime.</p>
<p>Hearing all the naive cries that facts aren&#8217;t for the choosing, I became curious about what our schools are teaching young people. So I asked a friend&#8217;s son, a bright young kid in fourth grade, what he&#8217;d been learning about alternatives and science. Do you know what he answered?!  I was shocked. &#8220;Alternative facts?&#8221;, he said. &#8220;You mean <strong>lies</strong>?&#8221; Sheesh. Kids these days&#8230; What are we teaching them? It&#8217;s a good thing we&#8217;ll soon have a new secretary of education.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, it was unusually cold last week. In a small fraction of the globe. For a couple of days. And what does that cold snap, that big wiggle in the Polar Vortex that carries high-atmospheric winds around the North Pole, &#8230; <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/01/13/polar-vortex-climate-change-red-herring/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Wow</strong></em>, it was <a title="Happy (Chilly) New Year" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/01/07/happy-chilly-new-year/" target="_blank">unusually cold last week</a>. In a small fraction of the globe. For a couple of days. And what does that cold snap, that big wiggle in the <em><strong><span style="color:#00ccff;">Polar Vortex</span></strong></em> that carries high-atmospheric winds around the North Pole, imply about &#8220;climate change&#8221;, also known as &#8220;global warming&#8221;, also known as &#8220;global weirding&#8221;?</p>
<p>The answer is very simple. <strong>Nothing.</strong></p>
<p>If you heard anyone suggest otherwise &#8212; whether they said that the extreme <em><strong>cold</strong></em> implies that there is <em>no</em> global warming going on, or they said that the <em><strong>extreme</strong></em> cold implies that global warming <em>is</em> happening &#8212; you should seriously question anything that person says when it comes to climate change. Because that person does not respect (or perhaps even understand) the difference between anecdote and evidence; between weather and climate; between a large fluctuation and a small but long-term trend. Or between media hoopla and science.</p>
<p>In the interest of an imperfect analogy: Let me ask you this. Are you generally happier, or less happy, than you were five years ago? Answer this as best you can.</p>
<p>Now let me ask you another question. Did you, within the last month, have a really, really bad day, or a really, really good one?</p>
<p>Does the answer to the second question have much to do with the answer to the first one?</p>
<p>Barring an exceptional recent disaster in your personal or professional life, the fact that, say, last Thursday your car broke down, you locked yourself out of your house, your dog vomited on the carpet and you got caught in the rain without your umbrella does not have anything to do with whether you are a happier person than you were five years ago. Being a happier person has more to do with whether you have a better job, a happier family, a better sense of self-esteem, and things like that. And even if you love your job, you know there are going to be really bad days in the office sometimes. That&#8217;s just the way it goes. We all know that.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the same with <a href="http://www.macrotrends.net/1319/dow-jones-100-year-historical-chart" target="_blank">daily and monthly and yearly fluctuations in the stock market</a> compared to the <a href="http://www.measuringworth.com/datasets/usgdp/graph.php" target="_blank">slow but fairly steady century-long growth of the U.S. economy</a> (both curves corrected for inflation.)</p>
<p><strong><em>So why, when there&#8217;s a big fluctuation in the daily, monthly or even seasonal weather, do people jump up and down about what the implications are for the long-term trends in climate?<span id="more-7104"></span></em></strong></p>
<p>Any one fluctuation, whether hot or cold, dry or wet, windy or calm, is by itself irrelevant. Weather fluctuates; that&#8217;s just how it is. It&#8217;s by no means unusual, now or in the distant past, for temperatures in the central United States to swing by 50ºF (28ºC) in just a few hours. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.weather.com/news/5-extreme-temperature-drops-20130118" target="_blank">a fun story by the Weather Channel</a> listing a few extreme temperature swings, all of which were more dramatic than the recent cold spell.  Weather in the U.S. has seen extremes since before Europeans arrived here and started recording their experiences, and it will continue to do so whether global warming persists or not.</p>
<p>Moreover, the recent cold wasn&#8217;t as exceptional as portrayed in the press, or as it seemed to people under the age of 40. One of the reasons that so many records were set this past week was that January 7th, over the past century, hasn&#8217;t previously seen an exceptionally cold day in the southeast. Specifically, let&#8217;s look at Greensboro, North Carolina, which was <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/coldest-jan-7-ever-15-record-low-temperatures-set-polar-vortex-1531012" target="_blank">described in the press as follows</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Greensboro, N.C., also witnessed a major drop in its record low temperature, going from a previous record of 14 degrees to 5 degrees. &#8220;</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, what were (before this year) the record temps in that town during the first 10 days of January? (see <a href="http://www.erh.noaa.gov/rah/climate/data/gso.daily.records.temp.precip.html">http://www.erh.noaa.gov/rah/climate/data/gso.daily.records.temp.precip.html</a>)</p>
<p>Jan 1: 8<br />
Jan 2: 5<br />
Jan 3: 7<br />
Jan 4: 3<br />
Jan 5: 3<br />
Jan 6: 5<br />
Jan 7: 14 ==&gt; 5 in 2014<br />
Jan 8: 6<br />
Jan 9: 2<br />
Jan 10: 1<br />
Jan 11: -5</p>
<p>In other words, the previous century or so of January 7ths were unusual &#8212; every other day in early January had already seen a very cold day! <em>All this recent cold snap did was bring it into line with other cold early January days!</em> A similar story held true in Atlanta. In short, despite the &#8220;record cold&#8221; media hype, quite a few of the new &#8220;records&#8221; weren&#8217;t especially exceptional for January&#8230; they were &#8220;normal&#8221; records, not worthy of the amazement expressed by reporters and citizens alike.</p>
<p>The issue this highlights is that if you want to tell whether the climate is getting warmer, the record high and low temperatures on a given day aren&#8217;t going to tell you much! The record temperatures fluctuate and are subject to random, extraordinary events. We don&#8217;t know how rare those exceptional events are, and the more wild and spectacular they are, the less we know about them.  If something happens once every one, three or ten centuries, but we only have one century of records, we&#8217;ve only seen it happen once or perhaps twice, if ever.  So when it happens, we can&#8217;t say &#8220;aha, that&#8217;s something that would not have happened if it weren&#8217;t for climate change&#8221;. We can&#8217;t draw such a conclusion, anymore than we can conclude that your stunningly bad day at work last week implies that your job, in the grand scheme of things, isn&#8217;t going to be as fulfilling in future as it used to be.</p>
<p>Take a look at this plot, from <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/NORMS/DisplayNORMS.asp?AirportCode=KSAT&amp;SafeCityName=San_Antonio&amp;StateCode=TX&amp;Units=none&amp;IATA=SAT" target="_blank">the website Weather Underground</a>, which tells us something about the weather and climate in San Antonio, Texas.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">It shows, for each day of the year, over many years, the average high and average low temperatures in blue, and the </span>record daily highs and lows in red. <span style="color:#808080;"><em>[Unfortunately I do not know exactly how many years are included in this data; I would estimate 60 years, but Weather Underground does not provide this important information &#8212; and they should.]  </em></span>Of course the average and record highs and lows all trend higher in the summer and lower in the winter, as expected. But notice:</p>
<ul>
<li>the average highs and lows are smooth curves</li>
<li>the record highs and lows are jagged curves</li>
</ul>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>Because for each day, <em>every year contributes to the average</em>. Year-to-year fluctuations for each day get smoothed out, as do day-to-day fluctuations in each year. So the curve showing the average is smooth as you move from one day to the next.</p>
<p>By contrast, only special, unique, remarkable, extraordinary days contribute to the record high and record low on a particular day. These are subject to large day-to-day fluctuations, because something extraordinary may have happened on January 9th of some 20th century year, but not on January 10th or 8th.</p>
<p>So a specific event with record heat or record cold isn&#8217;t useful for telling us about climate change.  Though impressive, it just represents the vagaries of life that get in the way of us understanding the real long-term trend, just as a truly bad day can make someone forget, for a short while anyway, that his or her life is going pretty well on the whole.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the same with extreme hurricanes and tornadoes, droughts and floods. These are too rare, and require too many elements to come together in a unique mix, for us to easily conclude anything about them. Hurricanes Irene and Sandy were a big deal in and around New York City; but are they signs of global warming?! What about the devastating 1938 hurricane that hit eastern New England? What about the two strong hurricanes that struck New England, a month apart, in 1869? It&#8217;s impossible to conclude that Irene and Sandy are related to global warming/weirding. Only if you see something steady over decades &#8212; the average storm becoming stronger, or the average number of storms rising &#8212; or a dramatic trend &#8212; Irene and Sandy-like storms ceasing to be rare and becoming once-every-other-year events over decades &#8212; will you be able to draw any conclusions from hurricanes that the climate has really changed.</p>
<p>No&#8230; if you want to determine whether global warming is occurring, you must set aside the record high or low temperatures, the extreme storms, the exceptional events&#8230; the ones that the media reports, and the ones that you yourself easily remember. Instead, you need to look at the averages &#8212; which is where the data is sufficient, and sufficiently stable, <a title="Climate Change in Climate Change" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/10/24/climate-change-in-climate-change/" target="_blank">for some conclusion that the Earth has slightly warmed</a> (by just 1 &#8211; 2 ºF = 0.5 &#8211; 1.1ºC &#8211;which is still <a href="http://themadisonenergygroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Ag_Upsala_Glacier.jpg" target="_blank">enough to melt a lot of glaciers</a>)  to be drawn. And even our current 100 years of data from around the globe is just barely enough to make that possible.  I&#8217;ll cover that issue another time.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s not waste our time fishing for red herrings.  Yes, it is possible that an overall small increase in the temperature of the globe will make wild weather more common. But it will be decades before we have enough data to tell whether, in fact, the rare events of which we have so few examples really are more or less common than they used to be.  And no one event, in isolation, should ever be mentioned in the same sentence as &#8220;climate change&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just in case you weren&#8217;t convinced by <a title="Help! I’m a Hostage! (D – 7)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/10/help-im-a-hostage-d-7/" target="_blank">yesterday&#8217;s post</a> that the shutdown, following on a sequester and a recession, is doing some real damage to this nation&#8217;s scientists, science, and future, here is another link for you.</p>
<p>Jonathan Lilly is a oceanographer, a senior research scientist at NorthWest Research Associates in Redmond, Washington, and I can vouch that he is a first-rate scientist and an excellent blogger.  He writes in an article entitled</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jmlilly.net/asdkfjhasfkjha.html" target="_blank">Stories from the front: oceanographers navigate the government shutdown</a></p>
<p>about a wide range of damaging problems affecting this field of study.  What&#8217;s nice about this post, compared to my own general one from yesterday, is that he has a lot of specific detail.</p>
<p>Here are some other links, demonstrating the breadth and depth of the impact:</p>

The effects of the government shutdown continue to ripple outward.  Scientific research doesn&#8217;t cope well with shutdowns.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/us-government-shutdown-antarctic-research-program-5-other-shuttered-science-programs-1419918">http://www.ibtimes.com/us-government-shutdown-antarctic-research-program-5-other-shuttered-science-programs-1419918</a></p>
<p>In many fields, the research has to be maintained continuously; if you shut it down, even for a short period, all your work is wasted.  <span id="more-6773"></span>For instance, if you&#8217;re working in biology, all your stuff dies.   Back to square one, if you can afford it.  Or if you&#8217;re following an evolving story season by season, missing a season can mean you don&#8217;t have good data and you can&#8217;t draw any conclusions.  Guess you won&#8217;t get that Ph. D. after all; time to go find another line of work, after thanking taxpayers for paying for your now wasted education.  And if something exciting and once-in-a-lifetime happens in the sky, we may not have our telescopes up and running to observe it.  Oh well, what&#8217;s another 150 years?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/08/10-effects-government-shutdown-science_n_4058464.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/08/10-effects-government-shutdown-science_n_4058464.html</a></p>
<p>Does this affect non-scientists?  Of course it does.   If  a serious disease breaks out, where is the Center for Disease Control to notice it and keep track of it?  Who is monitoring our food supply?  Do we really think that unscrupulous food producers, here and abroad, won&#8217;t take advantage of the fact that the Food and Drug Administration isn&#8217;t doing its testing?  What about hackers from hostile nations; are they on shutdown?  If this doesn&#8217;t frighten you, I don&#8217;t know what will&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=50156812n">http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=50156812n</a></p>
<p>And what about the sick who would normally be able to benefit from programs run by the National Institutes of Health?  Imagine you had a sick relative who was not yet &#8220;in imminent danger of dying&#8221;:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/10/health/in-shutdown-clinical-trial-enrollment-slows-but-doesnt-halt.html?_r=0">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/10/health/in-shutdown-clinical-trial-enrollment-slows-but-doesnt-halt.html?_r=0</a></p>
<p>The most hideous part of all of this is that some of our best scientists are actually forbidden, by law, from doing science until this is over.  And meanwhile their chores pile up &#8212; they can&#8217;t work on those either &#8212; which will also get in the way of doing science when they return.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/03/opinion/urry-nasa-shutdown/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/03/opinion/urry-nasa-shutdown/index.html</a></p>
<p>Coming after a recession and a <a title="Not As Painless As They’d Have You Believe" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/05/15/not-as-painless-as-theyd-have-you-believe/" target="_blank">sequester</a> (which were enough to wipe out my own research program), and with no end in sight, one wonders whether the nation will lose an entire generation of young scientists.  You know, young people with little kids and a mortgage <strong>do</strong> have to get paid on time; do they dare work in a government-related institution if they&#8217;re going to be <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/10/09/shutdown-furloughs-return-to-work/2953191/" target="_blank">furloughed</a> every year or two?  And certainly, if you are a young scientist born in another country who is considering whether to take a job offer in the United States compared to remaining in or returning to your own country, you are certainly going to have increasingly serious worries about whether it&#8217;s a good career choice.  We are risking our ability to bring the best young talent from around the world to work in our laboratories and universities.  Not to mention that if you are a foreign scientist, you may not think it so wise to collaborate with American scientists, whose funding might not arrive or who might be forced to stop work.  American scientists may find it increasingly difficult to participate in both small-scale and large-scale international projects.</p>
<p>And this is just a shutdown!  Heaven forbid we should keep threatening to go into something resembling default!  Just when we were starting to get out of the recession, the deficit was coming down, and we had a serious chance to deal with our long-term fiscal challenges, now we&#8217;re going to make things worse again?!</p>
<p>This is a self-imposed and increasingly serious mess.  Our country stands for the rights of all, and those rights should be defended.  But no group, even a large one, and certainly not one with <a href="http://nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/10/09/20886586-kochs-to-congress-focus-on-spending-not-obamacare" target="_blank">a very small, wealthy core</a> <em>(that&#8217;s right, $235 million in donations over just one year &#8212; just think of all the medical and other scientific research that could have funded)</em>, has the right to threaten the rest of us with economic ruin, and risk our hard work and our livelihoods.  Every citizen with an interest in and an understanding of science, business and politics has the responsibility to stand up and be counted.  So please, consider writing and calling your own Congresspeople (<a href="http://www.usa.gov/Contact/Elected.shtml" target="_blank">find them here</a>), and also the people outside your district who are holding us hostage.  And then write and call them tomorrow.  And the next day.  And the next.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I gave a public talk at <a href="http://www.ursinus.edu/netcommunity" target="_blank">Ursinus College</a>, a liberal arts college in aptly named Collegeville, Pennsylvania. <em>[For those outside the U.S.; a `college&#8217; in the U.S. is a university whose students are all undergraduates, mainly 18-22 years old; and a &#8220;liberal arts college&#8221;  aims to give students a broad education in the arts and sciences, along with more focused training in their chosen discipline.] </em>My visit was sponsored by the college&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ursinus.edu/netcommunity/academics/academic-programs/center-for-science-and-the-common-good" target="_blank">Center for Science and the Common Good</a>, an impressive little program funded by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (kudos to them!).  Its goal is to assure that the Center&#8217;s `fellows&#8217; &#8212; the students in the program &#8212; are not only trained in their scientific fields but also become versed in thinking broadly about the role of science in our culture and society, and about how science is communicated to the public.</p>
<p>These wider issues are ones I think about a lot &#8212; I myself was educated at <a href="http://simons-rock.edu/" target="_blank">a liberal arts college</a> &#8212; and are what motivated me to start this website and blog.  So I was honored that the Center invited me to visit. And they kept me (pleasantly) busy! In addition to the public talk, I spoke at length with the fellows of the Center about the role of science and scientists in society, as well as about the Center&#8217;s program and their career plans, and I also gave the undergraduate physics majors a slightly more technical tour of modern particle physics.</p>
<p>Since the Center was my host, my public talk was somewhat different from ones I&#8217;ve given previously.  Rather than focus entirely on the science behind <a title="Why the Higgs Matters, In A Few Sentences" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/03/20/why-the-higgs-matters-in-a-few-sentences/" target="_blank">the Higgs particle and field</a>, I included some comments concerning the role of scientists in communicating science to the public. Among the meta-scientific questions I touched on were these:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">What role should and can be played by blogs and websites run by scientists?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">Can (or should) anything be done about the wildly inaccurate science reporting that one so often sees in the media?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">Is it really that important that the public be informed about scientific research &#8212; given that public knowledge of the details of law, medicine, construction, accounting, plumbing, and other technical fields is also very limited?</span></li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ve got my own (tentative) answers to these questions, but if you&#8217;d like to weigh in, I&#8217;d be interested in your opinions. (If you do decide to make a comment, please feel free to include a parenthetic remark describing how much science you yourself know, and whether you learned it, say, in college, from magazines or popular books, etc.  This will give us all some perspective on what might shape your views.)</p>
<p>Thanks again to Ursinus College for the invitation and a very interesting visit!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/339/6125/1252.full" target="_blank">In a letter entitled &#8220;Am I Wrong?&#8221;</a>, Bruce Alberts, Editor-in-Chief of the major journal <em>Science,</em> asks how the United States has gone so far off course.  The leading nation in a technological age has lost sight of its scientific foundation; what will be the consequences?</p>
<p>A mere twenty years ago, this nation was clearly the best place in the world to do scientific research.  Since 2000 the decline has been precipitous, and though the U.S. still surely ranks in the top ten, few would say it clearly is the best anymore.  In general, the country remains a relatively great place to live and work.  But any excellent young scientist from abroad has to think carefully about coming to or staying in the U.S. for a career, because there might not be enough money to support even first-rate research.  Similarly, any young U.S. scientist, no matter how devoted to this country and no matter how skilled, may face the tough choice of either going abroad or abandoning his or her career. (It&#8217;s not just young people either, as I can personally attest.)</p>
<p>Whereas before the year 2000 it was easy for U.S. universities to attract the best in the world to teach and do research at their institutions, and to train the next generation of American scientists, the brain drain since that time has been awful.  (I see this up close, as more and more often I fail to hire talented individuals specifically because they see a better scientific and personal future outside the United States.)  And it is getting worse.  All of this affects our economy&#8217;s future, our society&#8217;s health, and even our ability to defend ourselves, especially since some of the most active spending on science is being done by countries that are hostile or potentially hostile to the free world.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to blame this on the recession.  &#8220;Oh, these are bad times and we all have to share the pain.&#8221;  That&#8217;s true, but this problem started long before 2008.  The system became threadbare during the Bush administration, and now, in the ensuing recession and political chaos, it&#8217;s at risk of falling apart.</p>
<p>Please forward this letter by Mr. Alberts to your friends.  This is serious business with long-term consequences.</p>
