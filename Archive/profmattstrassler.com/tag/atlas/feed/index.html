										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, a small but intrepid band of theoretical particle physicists (professor Jesse Thaler of MIT, postdocs Yotam Soreq and Wei Xue of CERN, Harvard Ph.D. student Cari Cesarotti, and myself) put out <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04222">a paper</a> that is unconventional in two senses. First, we looked for new particles at the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">Large Hadron Collider</a> in a way that hasn&#8217;t been done before, at least in public. And second, we looked for new particles at the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">Large Hadron Collider</a> in a way that hasn&#8217;t been done before, at least in public.</p>
<p>And no, there&#8217;s no error in the previous paragraph.</p>
<p>1) We used a small amount of <strong>actual data from the <a href="https://home.cern/science/experiments/cms">CMS experiment</a></strong>, even though we&#8217;re not ourselves members of the CMS experiment, to do a search for a new particle. Both ATLAS and CMS, the two large multipurpose experimental detectors at the Large Hadron Collider [LHC], have made a small fraction of their proton-proton collision data public, through a website called the <a href="http://opendata.cern.ch/">CERN Open Data Portal</a>. Some experts, including my co-authors Thaler, Xue and their colleagues, have used this data (and the simulations that accompany it) to do a variety of important studies involving known particles and their properties. [Here&#8217;s <a href="http://cylindricalonion.web.cern.ch/blog/201712/future-particle-physics-open">a blog post by Thaler concerning Open Data and its importance from his perspective.</a>] But our new study is the first to <strong><em>look for signs of a new particle in this public data</em></strong>. While our chances of finding anything were low, we had a larger goal: to see whether Open Data could be used for such searches. We hope our paper provides some evidence that Open Data offers a reasonable path for preserving priceless LHC data, allowing it to be used as an archive by physicists of the post-LHC era.</p>
<p>2) Since only had a tiny fraction of CMS&#8217;s data was available to us, about 1% by some count, how could we have done anything useful compared to what the LHC experts have already done? Well, that&#8217;s why we examined the data in a slightly unconventional way (one of <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/94815/contributions/1282671/">several methods that I&#8217;ve advocated for many years</a>, but has not been used in any public study). Consequently it allowed us to explore some ground that no one had yet swept clean, and even have a tiny chance of an actual discovery! But the larger scientific goal, absent a discovery, was <strong>to prove the value of this unconventional strategy</strong>, in hopes that the experts at CMS and ATLAS will use it (and others like it) in future. Their chance of discovering something new, using their full data set, is vastly greater than ours ever was.</p>
<p>Now don&#8217;t all go rushing off to download and analyze terabytes of CMS Open Data; you&#8217;d better know what you&#8217;re getting into first. It&#8217;s worthwhile, but it&#8217;s not easy going. LHC data is extremely complicated, and until this project I&#8217;ve always been skeptical that it could be released in a form that anyone outside the experimental collaborations could use. Downloading the data and turning it into a manageable form is itself a major task. Then, while studying it, there are an enormous number of mistakes that you can make (and we made quite a few of them) and you&#8217;d better know how to make lots of cross-checks to find your mistakes (which, fortunately, we did know; we hope we found all of them!) The CMS personnel in charge of the Open Data project were enormously helpful to us, and we&#8217;re very grateful to them; but since the project is new, there were inevitable wrinkles which had to be worked around. And you&#8217;d better have some friends among the experimentalists who can give you advice when you get stuck, or point out aspects of your results that don&#8217;t look quite right. [Our thanks to them!]</p>
<p>All in all, this project took us two years! Well, honestly, it should have taken half that time &#8212; but it couldn&#8217;t have taken much less than that, with all we had to learn. So trying to use Open Data from an LHC experiment is not something you do in your idle free time.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I feel it was worth it. At a personal level, I learned a great deal more about how experimental analyses are carried out at CMS, and by extension, at the LHC more generally. And more importantly, we were able to show what we&#8217;d hoped to show: that <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em><strong>there are still tremendous opportunities for discovery at the LHC</strong></em></span>, through the use of (even slightly) unconventional model-independent analyses. It&#8217;s a big world to explore, and we took only a small step in the easiest direction, but perhaps our efforts will encourage others to take bigger and more challenging ones.</p>
<p>For those readers with greater interest in our work, I&#8217;ll put out more details in two blog posts over the next few days: one about what we looked for and how, and one about our views regarding the value of open data from the LHC, not only for our project but for the field of particle physics as a whole.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This summer there was a blog post from <span class="fn"><a class="g-profile" title="author profile" href="https://plus.google.com/111136225362929878171" rel="author">Sabine Hossenfelder</a></span>  claiming that &#8220;<a href="http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2016/08/the-lhc-nightmare-scenario-has-come-true.html">The LHC `nightmare scenario&#8217; has come true</a>&#8221; &#8212; implying that the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC] has found nothing but a <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/">Standard Model Higgs particle</a> (the simplest possible type), and will find nothing more of great importance. With all due respect for the considerable intelligence and technical ability of the author of that post, I could not disagree more; not only are we not in a nightmare, it isn&#8217;t even night-time yet, and hardly time for sleep or even daydreaming. There&#8217;s a tremendous amount of work to do, and there may be many hidden discoveries yet to be made, lurking in existing LHC data.  Or elsewhere.</p>
<p>I can defend this claim (and have done so as recently as this month; here are <a href="https://indico.bnl.gov/getFile.py/access?contribId=19&amp;sessionId=6&amp;resId=0&amp;materialId=slides&amp;confId=1516">my slides</a>). But there&#8217;s evidence from another quarter that it is far too early for such pessimism.  It has appeared in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06536">a new paper</a> (a preprint, so not yet peer-reviewed) by an experimentalist named Arno Heister, who is evaluating 20-year old data from the experiment known as <a href="https://home.cern/about/experiments/aleph">ALEPH</a>.</p>
<p>In the early 1990s the Large Electron-Positron (LEP) collider at CERN, in the same tunnel that now houses the LHC, produced nearly 4 million Z particles at the center of ALEPH; the Z&#8217;s decayed immediately into other particles, and ALEPH was used to observe those decays.  Of course the data was studied in great detail, and you might think there couldn&#8217;t possibly be anything still left to find in that data, after over 20 years. But a hidden gem wouldn&#8217;t surprise those of us who have worked in this subject for a long time &#8212; especially those of us who have worked on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0604261">hidden valleys</a>. <em>(Hidden Valleys are theories with a set of new forces and low-mass particles, which, because they aren&#8217;t affected by the known forces excepting gravity, interact very weakly with the known particles.  They are also often called &#8220;dark sectors&#8221; if they have something to do with dark matter.)</em></p>
<p>For some reason most experimenters in particle physics don&#8217;t tend to look for things just because they can; they stick to signals that theorists have already predicted. Since hidden valleys only hit the market in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0604261">a 2006 paper I wrote with then-student Kathryn Zurek</a>, long after the experimenters at ALEPH had moved on to other experiments, nobody went back to look in ALEPH or other LEP data for hidden valley phenomena (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1003.0705">with one exception</a>.) I didn&#8217;t expect anyone to ever do so; it&#8217;s a lot of work to dig up and recommission old computer files.</p>
<p>This wouldn&#8217;t have been a problem if the big LHC experiments (ATLAS, CMS and LHCb) had looked extensively for the sorts of particles expected in hidden valleys. ATLAS and CMS especially have many advantages; for instance, the LHC has made over a hundred times more Z particles than LEP ever did. But despite specific proposals for what to look for (and <a href="http://indico.cern.ch/event/46250/">a decade of pleading</a>), only a few limited searches have been carried out, mostly for very long-lived particles, for particles with mass of a few GeV/c² or less, and for particles produced in unexpected Higgs decays. And that means that, yes, hidden physics could certainly still be found in old ALEPH data, and in other old experiments. Kudos to Dr. Heister for taking a look.<span id="more-8706"></span></p>
<p>Now, has he actually <strong>found</strong> something hidden at ALEPH? It&#8217;s far too early to say. Dr. Heister is careful not to make a strong claim: his paper refers to an observed excess, not to the discovery of or even evidence for anything. But his analysis can be interpreted as showing a hint of a new particle (let&#8217;s call it the <strong>V particle</strong>, just to have a name for it) decaying sometimes to a muon and an anti-muon, and probably also sometimes to an electron and an anti-electron, with a rest mass about 1/3 of that of the Z particle &#8212; about 30 <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/">GeV</a>/c². Here&#8217;s one of the plots from his paper, showing the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-invariant-mass/">invariant mass</a> of the muon and anti-muon in Z decays that also have evidence of a bottom quark and a bottom anti-quark (each one giving a <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/jets-the-manifestation-of-quarks-and-gluons/">jet of hadrons</a> that has been &#8220;<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/jets-the-manifestation-of-quarks-and-gluons/b-tagging-identifying-jets-from-bottom-quarks/">b-tagged</a>&#8221;).  There&#8217;s an excess at about 30 GeV.</p>

<p>The simplest physical effect that would produce such a bump is a new particle; indeed this is how the Z particle itself was identified, over three decades ago.</p>
<p>However, the statistical significance of the bump is still only (after <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2011/08/28/nature-is-full-of-surprises/">look-elsewhere effect</a>) at most 3 standard deviations, according to the paper. So this bump could just be a fluke; we&#8217;ve seen similar ones disappear with more data, for example <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/04/20/dark-matter-now-you-see-it-now-you-dont/">this one</a>. There are also a couple of serious issues that will give experts pause <em>(the width of the bump is surprisingly large; the angular correlations seem consistent with background rather than a new signal; etc.)</em> So the data itself is not enough to convince anyone, including Dr. Heister, though it is certainly interesting.</p>
<p>Conversely it is intriguing that the bump in the plot above is observed in events with bottom quarks. It is common for hidden valleys <em>(including everything from a simple abelian Higgs models to more complex confining models)</em> to contain</p>
<ul>
<li>at least one spin-one particle V (which can decay to muon/anti-muon or electron/positron) and</li>
<li>at least one spin-zero particle S (which can decay to bottom/anti-bottom preferentially, with occasional decays to tau/anti-tau.)</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, in such models, a rare decay such as Z  ⇒ V + S, producing a muon/anti-muon pair plus two bottom quark/anti-quark <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/jets-the-manifestation-of-quarks-and-gluons/">jets</a>, would often be a possibility.*</p>
<p>*<span style="color:#808080;"><em>[In this case the bottom and anti-bottom jets would themselves show a peak in their invariant mass, but unfortunately their distribution in the presence of a candidate V was not shown. One other obvious prediction of such a model is a handful of striking Z ⇒ V + S ⇒ muon/anti-muon + tau/anti-tau events; but the expected number is very small and somewhat model-dependent.]</em></span></p>
<p>Another possibility (also common in hidden valleys) is that the bottom-tagged jets aren&#8217;t actually from real bottom quarks, and are instead fake bottom jets generated by one or two new long-lived hidden valley particles.</p>
<p>But clearly, before anyone gets excited, far more evidence is required. We&#8217;ll need to see similar studies done at one or more of the three other experiments that ran concurrently with ALEPH &#8212; L3, OPAL, and DELPHI. And of course ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb will surely take a look in their own data; for instance, ATLAS and CMS could search for a dilepton resonance in events with at least two bottom-tagged jets, where the whole system of bottom-tagged jets and dileptons has a invariant mass not greater than about 100 GeV/c². <em><span style="color:#ff0000;">[[IMPORTANT NOTE ADDED: It has been pointed out to me (thanks Matt Reece) that there was <a href="http://cds.cern.ch/record/2223864?ln=en">a relevant CMS search</a> from 2015 that had somehow entirely escaped my attention, in which <strong>one</strong> b-tag was required and a di-muon bump was sought between 25 and 60 GeV.  Although not aimed at hidden valleys, it provides one of the few constraints upon them in this mass range.  And at first glance, it seems to disfavor any signal large enough to explain the ALEPH excess.  But there might be subtleties, so let me not draw firm conclusions yet.]]</span></em> They should also look for the V particle in other ways &#8212; perhaps following the methods I&#8217;ve suggested repeatedly (see for example pages 40-45 of <a href="http://indico.cern.ch/event/46250/attachments/950108/1348060/Strassler.LPC1.pdf">this 2008 talk</a>) &#8212; since the V might not only appear in Z particle decays. <em>[That is: look for boosted V&#8217;s; look for V&#8217;s in high-energy events or high missing-energy events; look for V&#8217;s in events with many jets, possibly with bottom-tags; etc.]</em> In any case, if anything like the V particle really exists, several (and perhaps all) of the experiments should see some evidence for it, and in more than just a single context.</p>
<p>Though we should be skeptical that today&#8217;s paper on ALEPH data is the first step toward a major discovery, at minimum it is important for what it indirectly confirms: that searches at the LHC are far from complete, and that discoveries might lie hidden, for example in rare Z decays (and in rare decays of other particles, such as the top quark.) Neither ATLAS, CMS nor LHCb have ever done a search for rare but spectacular Z particle decays, but they certainly could, as they recently did for the Higgs particle; and if Heister&#8217;s excess turns out to be a real signal, they will be seen to have missed a huge opportunity.  So I hope that Heister&#8217;s paper, at a minimum, will encourage the LHC experiments to undertake a broader and more comprehensive program of searches for low-mass particles with very weak interactions.  Otherwise, my own nightmare, in which the diamonds hidden in the rough might remain undetected &#8212; perhaps for decades &#8212; might come true.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back in the California Gold Rush, many people panning for gold saw a yellow glint at the bottom of their pans, and thought themselves lucky.  But more often than not, it was pyrite &#8212; iron sulfide &#8212; fool&#8217;s gold&#8230;</p>
<p>Back in December 2015, a bunch of particle physicists saw <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2015/12/18/so-what-is-it/">a bump on a plot</a>.  The plot showed the numbers of events with two photons <em>(particles of light)</em> as a function of the &#8220;<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-invariant-mass/">invariant mass</a>&#8221; of the photon pair.  (To be precise, they saw a big bump on one ATLAS plot, and a bunch of small bumps in similar plots by CMS and ATLAS [the two general purpose experiments at the Large Hadron Collider].)  What was that bump?  Was it a sign of a new particle?</p>
<p>A similar bump was <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/holiday-higgs-hints-confidence-inspiring-or-not/">the first sign of the Higgs boson</a>, though that was far from clear at the time.  What about <em>this</em> bump?</p>
<p>As I wrote in December,</p>
<p><em>  “Well, to be honest, probably it’s just that: a bump on a plot. But just in case it’s not…”</em></p>
<p>and I went on to describe what it might be if the bump were more than just a statistical fluke.  A lot of us &#8212; theoretical particle physicists like me &#8212; had a lot of fun, and learned a lot of physics, by considering what that bump might mean if it were a sign of something real.  (In fact I&#8217;ll be giving a talk here at CERN next week entitled <em>&#8220;Lessons from a Flash in the Pan,&#8221;</em> describing what I learned, or remembered, along the way.)</p>
<p>But updated results from CMS, based on a large amount of new data taken in 2016, have been seen.   (Perhaps these have leaked out early; they were supposed to be presented tomorrow along with those from ATLAS.)  They apparently show that where the bump was before, they now see nothing.  In fact there&#8217;s a small dip in the data there.</p>
<p>So &#8212; it seems that what we saw in those December plots was a fluke.  It happens.  I&#8217;m certainly disappointed, but hardly surprised.  Funny things happen with small amounts of data.</p>
<p>At the ICHEP 2016 conference, which started today, official presentation of the updated ATLAS and CMS two-photon results will come on Friday, but I think we all know the score.  So instead our focus will be on  the many other results (dozens and dozens, I hear) that the experiments will be showing us for the first time.  Already we had a small blizzard of them today.  I&#8217;m excited to see what they have to show us &#8230; the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/">Standard Model</a>, and <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/naturalness/">naturalness</a>, remain on trial.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the first time in some years, I&#8217;m spending two and a half weeks at CERN (the lab that hosts the Large Hadron Collider [LHC]). Most of my recent visits have been short or virtual, but this time* there&#8217;s <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/466926/">a theory workshop</a> that has collected together a number of theoretical particle physicists, and it&#8217;s a good opportunity for all of us to catch up with the latest creative ideas in the subject.   It&#8217;s also an opportunity to catch a glimpse of the furtive immensity of Mont Blanc, a hulking bump on the southern horizon, although only if (as is rarely the case) nature offers clear and beautiful weather.</p>
<p>More importantly, new results on the data collected so far in 2016 at the LHC are coming very soon!  They will be presented at the ICHEP conference that will be held in Chicago starting August 3rd. And there&#8217;s something we&#8217;ll be watching closely.</p>
<p>You may remember that <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2015/12/18/so-what-is-it/">in a post last December</a> I wrote:</p>
<p><em>  &#8220;Everybody wants to know. <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2015/12/16/is-this-the-beginning-of-the-end-of-the-standard-model/" target="_blank">That bump seen on the ATLAS and CMS two-photon plots</a>!  <strong>What… IS… it…?</strong>&#8220;</em></p>
<p>Why the excitement? A bump of this type can be a signal of a new particle (as was the case for <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-discovery-of-the-higgs/higgs-discovery-the-data/">the Higgs particle itself</a>.) And since a new particle that would produce a bump of this size was both completely unexpected and completely plausible, there was hope that we were seeing a hint of something new and important.</p>
<p>However, as I wrote in the same post,</p>
<p><em>  &#8220;Well, to be honest, probably it’s just that: a bump on a plot. But just in case it’s not&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>
<p>and I went on to discuss briefly what it might mean if it wasn&#8217;t just a statistical fluke. But speculation may be about to end: finally, we&#8217;re about to find out if it was indeed just a fluke &#8212; or a sign of something real.</p>
<p>Since December <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2016/06/09/pop-went-the-weasel-but-vroom-goes-the-lhc/">the amount of 13 TeV collision data available at ATLAS and CMS</a> (the two general purpose experiments at the LHC) has roughly quadrupled, which means that typical bumps and wiggles on their 2015-2016 plots have decreased in relative size by about a factor of two (= square root of four). If the December bump is just randomness, it should also decrease in relative size. If it&#8217;s real, it should remain roughly the same relative size, but appear more prominent relative to the random bumps and wiggles around it.</p>
<p>Now, there&#8217;s a caution to be added here. The December ATLAS bump was so large and fat compared to what was seen at CMS that (since reality has to appear the same at both experiments, once enough data has been collected) it was pretty obvious that <strong>even if it there were a real bump there, at ATLAS it was probably in combination with a statistical fluke that made it look larger and fatter than its true nature.</strong><em> [Something similar happened with the Higgs; <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/lhcposts/old-pages-of-historical-interest/the-december-higgs-update/">the initial bump that ATLAS saw was twice as big as expected</a>, which is why it showed up so early, but it gradually has shrunk as more data has been collected and it is now close to its expected size.  In retrospect, that tells us that ATLAS&#8217;s original signal was indeed combined with a statistical fluke that made it appear larger than it really is.]</em> What that means is that even if the December bumps were real, we would expect the ATLAS bump to shrink in size (but not statistical significance) and we would expect the CMS bump to remain of similar size (but grow in statistical significance). Remember, though, that &#8220;expectation&#8221; is not certainty, because at every stage statistical flukes (up or down) are possible.</p>
<p>In about a week we&#8217;ll find out where things currently stand. But the mood, as I read it here in the hallways and cafeteria, is not one of excitement. Moreover, the fact that the update to the results is (at the moment) unobtrusively scheduled for a parallel session of the ICHEP conference next Friday, afternoon time at CERN, suggests we&#8217;re not going  to see convincing evidence of anything exciting. If so, then the remaining question will be whether the reverse is true: whether the data will show convincing evidence that the December bump was definitely a fluke.</p>
<p>Flukes are guaranteed; with limited amounts of data, they can&#8217;t be avoided.  Discoveries, on the other hand, require skill, insight, and luck: you must ask a good question, address it with the best available methods, and be fortunate enough that (as is rarely the case) nature offers a clear and interesting answer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the end of April, as reported hysterically in the press, the Large Hadron Collider was shut down and set back an entire week by a &#8220;fouine&#8221;, an animal famous for chewing through wires in cars, and apparently in colliders too. What a rotten little weasel! especially for its skill in managing to get the English-language press to blame the wrong species &#8212; a fouine is actually a beech marten, not a weasel, and I&#8217;m told it goes Bzzzt, not Pop. But who&#8217;s counting?</p>
<p>Particle physicists are counting. Last week the particle accelerator operated so well that it generated almost half as many collisions as were produced in 2015 (from July til the end of November), bringing the 2016 total to about three-fourths of 2015.</p>
<p><img class="" src="https://i2.wp.com/cms-service-lumi.web.cern.ch/cms-service-lumi/publicplots/int_lumi_per_day_cumulative_pp_2016OnlineLumi.png" width="482" height="362" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The key question is how many of the next few weeks will be like this past one.  We&#8217;d be happy with three out of five, even two.  If the amount of 2016 data can significantly exceed that of 2015 by July 15th, as now seems likely, a definitive answer to the question on everyone&#8217;s mind <em>(namely, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2015/12/18/so-what-is-it/">what is the bump on that plot?!?</a> a new particle? or just a statistical fluke?)</em> might be available at the time of the early August ICHEP conference.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s looking more likely that we&#8217;re going to have an interesting August&#8230; though it&#8217;s not at all clear yet whether we&#8217;ll get great news (in which case we get no summer vacation), bad news (in which case we&#8217;ll all need a vacation), or ambiguous news (in which case we wait a few additional months for yet more news.)</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Back in December 2015, there was some excitement when the experiments ATLAS and CMS at the Large Hadron Collider [LHC] &#8212; especially ATLAS &#8212; reported signs of an unexpectedly large number of proton-proton collisions in which two highly energetic photons [particles &#8230; <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2016/03/18/the-diphoton-excess-improves-a-bit/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back in December 2015, there was some excitement when the experiments ATLAS and CMS at the Large Hadron Collider [LHC] &#8212; especially ATLAS &#8212; <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2015/12/16/is-this-the-beginning-of-the-end-of-the-standard-model/">reported signs of an unexpectedly large number of proton-proton collisions</a> in which</p>
<ul>
<li>two highly energetic photons [particles of light] were produced, and</li>
<li>the two photons could possibly have been produced in a decay of an unknown particle, whose mass would be about six times the mass of the Higgs particle (which ATLAS and CMS discovered in 2012.)</li>
</ul>
<p>This suggested the possibility of an unknown particle of some type with rest mass of 750 <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/">GeV</a>/c².  However, the excess could just be a statistical fluke, of no scientific importance and destined to vanish with more data.</p>
<p>The outlook for <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2015/12/18/so-what-is-it/">that bump on a plot at 750 GeV</a> has gotten a tad brighter&#8230; because not only do we have ATLAS&#8217;s plot, we now have increasing evidence for a similar bump on CMS&#8217;s plot. This is thanks largely to some hard work on the part of the CMS experimenters.  Some significant improvements at CMS,</p>
<ol>
<li>improved understanding of their photon energy measurements in their 2015 data,</li>
<li>ability to use 2015 collisions taken when their giant magnet wasn&#8217;t working &#8212; <em>fortunately, the one type of particle whose identity and energy can be measured without a magnet is&#8230; a photon!</em></li>
<li>combination of the 2015 data with their 2012 data,</li>
</ol>
<p>have increased the significance of their observed excess by a moderate amount. Here&#8217;s the scorecard.*</p>
<ul>
<li>CMS 2015 data (Dec.): excess is 2.6σ local, &lt; 1σ global</li>
<li>CMS 2015 data (<a href="https://indico.in2p3.fr/event/12279/session/12/contribution/218/material/slides/0.pdf">improved, Mar.</a>) 2.9σ local, &lt; 1σ global</li>
<li>CMS <a href="https://indico.in2p3.fr/event/12279/session/12/contribution/218/material/slides/0.pdf">2015+2012 data</a>: 3.4σ local, 1.6σ global</li>
<li>ATLAS 2015 data (Dec. and <a href="https://indico.in2p3.fr/event/12279/session/12/contribution/163/material/slides/0.pdf">Mar.</a>): 3.6σ local, 2.0σ global to get a narrow bump <em>[and 3.9σ local , 2.3σ global to get a somewhat wider bump, but notice this difference is quite insignificant, so narrow and wider are pretty much equally ok.]</em></li>
<li>ATLAS 2015+2012 data: not reported, but clearly goes up a bit more, by perhaps half a sigma?</li>
</ul>
<p>You can read a few more details at <a href="http://resonaances.blogspot.com/">Resonaances.</a></p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;">*<em>Significance is measured in σ (&#8220;<a style="color:#808080;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation">standard deviations</a>&#8221;) and for confidence in potentially revolutionary results we typically want to see local significance approaching 5σ and global approaching 3σ <strong>in both experiments</strong>. (The &#8220;local&#8221; significance tells you how unlikely it is to see a random bump of a certain size at a <strong>particular</strong> location in the plot, while the &#8220;global&#8221; significance tells you how unlikely it is to see such a bump <strong>anywhere</strong> in the plot &#8230; obviously smaller because of the <a style="color:#808080;" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/xotica/hurriquake-2011-what-are-the-chances/">look-elsewhere effect</a>.)</em></span></p>
<p>This is good news, but it doesn&#8217;t really reflect a qualitative change in the situation. It leaves us slightly more optimistic (which is much better than the alternative!) but, as noted in December, we still won&#8217;t actually know anything until we have either (a) more data to firm up the evidence for these bumps, or (b) a discovery of a completely independent clue, perhaps in existing data. Efforts for (b) are underway, and of course (a) will get going when the LHC starts again&#8230; soon!  Next news on this probably not til June at the earliest&#8230; unless we&#8217;re very lucky!</p>

<p>Well, to be honest, probably it&#8217;s just that: a bump on a plot. But just in case it&#8217;s not &#8212; just in case it <strong>really is</strong> the sign of a new particle in Large Hadron Collider [LHC] data &#8212; let me <em>(start to)</em> address the question.</p>
<p>First: <em>what it isn&#8217;t</em>. It can&#8217;t just be a second Higgs particle (a heavier version of <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-discovery-of-the-higgs/higgs-discovery-the-data/">the one found in 2012</a>) that is just appended to the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/">known particles</a>, with no other particles added in.  <span id="more-8268"></span>If you try to put that idea into the equations, you immediately find the new particle&#8217;s mass is so large that it (or anything similar) would decay <em>very often</em> to other known particles, and <em>very rarely</em> to photons.</p>
<p><em>[Like the Higgs particle, it would only interact with photons <strong>indirectly</strong>, via direct interactions with the other known particles (<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/decays-of-the-standard-model-higgs/">see figure 3 of this post</a>); but unlike the Higgs particle, it is heavy enough that it can decay to any particle/anti-particle pair with which it has direct interactions (<a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/decays-of-the-standard-model-higgs/">see figure 2 of the same post</a>); and the direct effect beats any indirect effect.]</em></p>
<p>Therefore, if this idea were correct, either</p>
<ul>
<li>no two-photon events would be observed yet, making the bump impossible, or</li>
<li>there would be tens of thousands of these new particles decaying to pairs of <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/jets-the-manifestation-of-quarks-and-gluons/">jets</a> (from quark/anti-quark pairs), or to top quark/anti-quark pairs, or to charged lepton/anti-lepton pairs&#8230; any of which would have been easily seen in studies done by ATLAS and CMS using the 2011-2012 LHC data.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Now, this has a really interesting implication!</span></strong> If this bump is a real particle, there must be <em>at least</em> one other particle that makes such a two-photon bump possible.  That new particle (maybe heavy, or maybe lightweight) hasn&#8217;t yet been found by the ATLAS or CMS (or LHCb!) experiments, but is almost certainly accessible to them. In fact, signs of an additional particle or particles may already be obvious (or almost obvious) in their existing data. It might just be a question of looking in the right place and of asking the right question.</p>
<p>This is what a lot of theoretical work this week has been about: considering the options for what the two-photon bump&#8217;s source might be, and thinking about further consequences of its possible existence, as far as other particles and forces with which it might be associated.</p>
<p><em>(And yes, I admit it; I chased this ambulance too. Took the week off from work. Didn&#8217;t sleep much.)</em></p>
<p>So <strong><em><span style="color:#800080;">what is it</span></em></strong>? There are a lot of possibilities. It could be a simple elementary particle like the electron, interacting with known particles indirectly, as a result of direct interactions with some heavy, as yet unknown particles. It could be a composite object like a proton, made from objects bound together by a new force that we are about to discover. It might be that the photons to which it seems to decay aren&#8217;t photons after all, but are new particles that mimic photons in some way (an idea that goes back at least to 2000.) I certainly don&#8217;t know what it is, and neither does anyone else yet. But each of the many different ideas comes with <strong><em>predictions</em></strong> &#8212; predictions which in many cases lead to LHC signals that can be looked for <span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>NOW!</b></span></p>
<p>We&#8217;ll have to wait quite a while, six months to a year, before we have enough new data to see the bump either disappear or become a completely convincing signal of a new particle.  However, perhaps the bump is a clue &#8230; a clue that can lead us to a discovery that can happen much sooner.</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>BUT WHAT IS IT????</strong></span> Sometime in the next few weeks I&#8217;ll write a non-expert&#8217;s guide to the various options. Probably this won&#8217;t happen before the holidays, but stay tuned in the New Year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At CERN, the laboratory that hosts the Large Hadron Collider [LHC]. Four years ago, almost to the day. Fabiola Gianotti, spokesperson for the ATLAS experiment, delivered the first talk in a presentation on 2011 LHC data. Speaking to the assembled scientists and dignitaries, she presented the message that energized the physics community: a little bump had shown up on a plot. <span id="more-8086"></span>On the plot were the numbers of proton-proton collisions that had produced two energetic photons <em>(particles of light)</em>, shown versus the &#8220;invariant mass&#8221; of the two photons <em>(the mass that a parent particle would have had, <strong>if</strong> the two photons had come from a parent particle &#8212; although the vast majority of them do not.) </em>Most two-photon production processes are pretty random, and produce data that forms a smooth curve on such a plot. But a new particle decaying to two photons would, if it existed, be observed as a little upward wiggle on that curve. And that&#8217;s what ATLAS&#8217;s data showed.</p>

<p>But those were early days. Statistical flukes happen more often than most people realize, and the bump wasn&#8217;t large enough to be convincing. Still, supporting the case, CMS (represented by Guido Tonelli) showed some hints too around the same mass, not just in two photon events but in some other plots. In retrospect, some of the CMS and ATLAS hints were real, though there was no way to be certain for the next six months.</p>
<p>Then on July 4th, 2012, Joe Incandela of CMS, followed by Gianotti, delivered the coup de grace. The data they showed confirmed a new type of particle, with behavior somewhat resembling a Higgs particle.</p>

<p>Within a few more months, it had become clear that the new particle was indeed a Higgs particle, resembling the one predicted in the Standard Model. <em>(The Standard Model is the set of equations used to predict the behavior of the known particles, with the inclusion of the simplest possible type of Higgs particle. We are calling the new Higgs particle &#8220;Standard Model-<strong>like</strong>&#8221; because we have a lot of work left to do before we can be confident that it <strong>really</strong> is the one that is present in the Standard Model.)</em></p>
<p>Fast forward to today. Gianotti, as of January 1, will become Director General of CERN. It is time now for a new generation of leading scientists to give the presentations on LHC&#8217;s 2015 data. 2011 was the start of a thrilling, exciting, maddening time as we waited through half of 2012 before the existence of the new particle became certain. Will we be so lucky today?  Rumors have been rife. Stay tuned.</p>
