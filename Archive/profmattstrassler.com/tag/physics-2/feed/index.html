										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nothing about quantum physics today, but &#8230; wait, <em>everything</em> is made using quantum physics&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Could you imagine getting a dog to sit absolutely still, while fully awake and listening to voices, for as much as 8 minutes? Researchers trained dogs to do it, then put them in an MRI [Magnetic Resonance Imaging] machine to obtain remarkable studies of how dogs&#8217; brains react to human voices and other emotional forms of human expression. [<a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/nuclear/mri.html" target="_blank">MRI is all about</a> magnetic fields, <a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/" target="_blank">protons</a>, spin, and resonance; particle physics!! more on that another time, perhaps.]   The authors claim this is the first study of its type to compare human brains to those of a non-primate species. Here&#8217;s something from <a href="http://www.cell.com/current-biology/retrieve/pii/S0960982214001237" target="_blank">the scientific article&#8217;s abstract</a>:</p>
<p><em>&#8230;</em><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;"><em>We presented dogs and humans with the same set of vocal and non-vocal stimuli to search for functionally analogous voice-sensitive cortical regions. We demonstrate that voice areas exist in dogs and that they show a similar pattern to anterior temporal voice areas in humans. Our findings also reveal that sensitivity to vocal emotional valence cues engages similarly located non-primary auditory regions in dogs and humans&#8230;</em> </span></p>
<p>So it seems, as dog owners have long suspected, that we&#8217;re not just imagining that our best friends are aware of our moods; they really are similar to us in some important ways.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a BBC article: <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-26276660" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-26276660</a></p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;re done with that, would you like to build up your muscles?  No exercise needed, just call the University of Texas at Dallas.  They&#8217;ve found that <em>&#8220;ordinary fishing line and sewing thread can be cheaply converted to powerful artificial muscles.  The new muscles can lift 100 times more weight and generate 100 times higher mechanical power than a human muscle of the same length and weight&#8230; The muscles are powered thermally by temperature changes, which can be produced electrically, by the absorption of light or by the chemical reaction of fuels.&#8221;</em>  [Quantum Physics = cool!!] The quotation above is from <a href="http://www.utdallas.edu/news/2014/2/21-28701_Researchers-Create-Powerful-Muscles-From-Fishing-L_story-wide.html" target="_blank">an interesting press release from the university</a>, reporting the research which was just published in the journal <em>Science</em>.  I recommend the press release because it mentions several interesting possible applications, including robotics technology  and clothing that adjusts to temperature.  Here&#8217;s also a nice article by Anna Kuchment (who&#8217;s on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/akuchment" target="_blank">here</a>):</p>
<p><a href="http://www.utdallas.edu/news/2014/2/21-28701_Researchers-Create-Powerful-Muscles-From-Fishing-L_story-wide.html" target="_blank">http://www.utdallas.edu/news/2014/2/21-28701_Researchers-Create-Powerful-Muscles-From-Fishing-L_story-wide.html</a></p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Though evolution left us with many wonderful abilities, it does seem that, year by year, humans are becoming less and less practically useful.   But at least our dogs will comfort us in our obsolescence.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While <a title="Science Past and Future, on Diverse Continents" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/06/19/science-past-and-future-on-diverse-continents/">we&#8217;re on the subject of China</a>&#8230; The US has had space stations for decades, and people here now show limited interest, barely caring that the US currently has no rocket that can carry people to space.  Now China has its own rockets and space station, and, with plenty of excitement and national pride, is putting them to good use.</p>
<p>Yesterday, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-22981839" target="_blank">some 60 million Chinese children watched a presentation and discussion from space, involving astronaut Wang Yaping and a Beijing classroom, on basic physics principles</a>: mass versus weight, gyroscopic motion, etc.</p>
<p>I hope she managed to explain that there <strong><em>is</em></strong> gravity in space&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Note Added</strong>: The full lecture, with English voice-over, is available here: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUAuZnpoZ58" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUAuZnpoZ58</a>.  Thank you, Yan Wenbin.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The scourge of &#8220;terrorism&#8221; &#8212; for today&#8217;s purposes, let&#8217;s take the word to mean attacks on civilians perpetrated by individuals or by small, stateless groups &#8212; is a part of human existence going back as far as you want to look. If a person has what he or she views as a grievance, then attacking people who are loosely connected to that grievance, in order to kill and maim some of them and frighten the rest, is obviously one of the options, immoral and hideous as it may be. There&#8217;s nothing modern about the strategy of terror.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s new about terrorism in the modern world is science. Science, via the technology that it makes possible, is a great multiplier. It allows an individual, or a small group, to exploit power inherent in nature, turning a task that no human could perform, or that would take a cast of thousands, into something that can be done with ease by a few people, or even just one. Of course this multiplied power has many benefits for us as individuals and for society as a whole; think of trains, tunnel-boring machines, skyscraper cranes, snow-blowers, pneumatic drills, aircraft engines, power plants, and on and on. But it also poses many risks and challenges that we have to face, as individuals and as a global civilization.<span id="more-5875"></span></p>
<p>I personally don&#8217;t think we can hope to eradicate terror; it&#8217;s too deeply ingrained in being human. The arms race between those who would carry out attacks and those who try to prevent them will never be won by either side. But every time the enemies of civil society develop a new tactic, it is important to respond by poking holes in it, to the extent possible. In fact it would be optimal to respond before that strategy actually gets used, though this never seems to happen in our culture. Still, better late than never, I suppose.</p>
<p>Enter the pressure cooker.</p>
<p>What is a pressure cooker? The basic scientific principle behind this device is very simple, and goes back at least as far as 1679. Denis Papin, a Frenchman (should we be surprised? <em>bon appetit!</em>), who was what we would today call a physicist and mathematician, is usually credited with its invention, though it didn&#8217;t become widespread until recent decades, when it became reliably safe for use in the home. I don&#8217;t know the precise history, but Papin, an expert on steam and its uses in engines, must have been among those who knew that under higher pressure, water boils at a higher temperature, as shown in the figure below. <em>(Anyone who lives at high altitude, where the pressure of the atmosphere is lower than at sea level, knows the reverse is true; water boils at a lower temperature in Denver or Mexico City or Kathmandu than it does in New York or Shanghai or Cairo, so it takes longer to cook food in boiling water.)</em> The hotter steam that emerges from the hotter boiling water can be used to cook food quickly and in a humid environment, keeping it moist.</p>

At sea level, the pressure of air is about 100 kPa, and water boils at 100 degrees Celsius, as marked by the red dot; the violet dot marks the maximum pressure and temperature of steam inside a standard pressure cooker.</p></div>
<p>The challenge for using high-pressure, high-temperature steam for cooking is that if the pressure in a gas is higher in one region than another, then the gas will move, if it can, in such a way as to equalize the pressure. Indeed, when you boil water in a tea kettle, the cool air outside the kettle has lower pressure than the hot steam in the kettle, so the steam rushes outward. And this flow of steam can be exploited to blow a whistle, alerting you that the water is boiling.  So high-temperature steam won&#8217;t stay where you want it to, unless you lock it inside a container.</p>
<p>A pressure cooker, therefore, has to be sealed tight when it is being used. You put the food above some water in the cooker; you close it; and you turn on the heat. The water boils a bit, and some steam forms above the water. In a kettle, the steam would escape and cause a whistle; but since the pressure cooker is sealed, the steam has no place to go, so the pressure of the air and steam inside the pressure cooker goes up a bit. This in turn increases the boiling point of the water. But the heat is still on, so the water gets hotter, boils a bit, more steam emerges, and as it has nowhere to go, the pressure again increases. And so it continues, moving the water and steam along the blue curve shown in the figure, until the desired pressure and temperature are reached.</p>
<p>Many pressure cookers can safely handle a pressure which is double the pressure that the atmosphere itself exerts on us down at sea level.  (&#8220;Safely&#8221; means the seal won&#8217;t break until the pressure reaches much higher levels.)   As seen in the figure, doubling the pressure found at sea level increases the boiling point of the water, and therefore the resulting steam, from 100 degrees Celsius to about 121 degrees (i.e. from 212 degrees Farenheit to 250 degrees).</p>
<p><em><span style="color:#888888;">Note that doubling the pressure means that the pressure difference between inside and outside is about the same magnitude, but opposite in direction, as would be found between ordinary sea-level air and a vacuum &#8212; i.e., a container out of which all the air had been pumped.  </span></em></p>
<p>Unfortunately the same tight seal that a pressure cooker requires is useful in multiplying the power of an explosive. The moment a material begins to explode, the chemical reaction it is undergoing creates high-pressure gases.  If the explosion begins in the open air, those gases begin to rush outward immediately. But if these gases are trapped &#8212; say, inside a pressure cooker &#8212; then they have nowhere to go, and so, in an instant, the pressure builds up. When finally the trapped gases are under so much pressure that they blast the containing vessel apart, they do so with a much more powerful explosion than would have occurred had they not been trapped. And of course, the broken pieces of the vessel, and any nasty materials stored inside the vessel, such as nails or metal balls, become deadly shrapnel.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that a pressure cooker, a simple, useful and widely available device, based on such simple scientific principles, can be used just as simply to increase the killing power of a single vicious individual. And it&#8217;s even more unfortunate that terror networks have been encouraging people to use this method, without us doing anything to make pressure cookers more difficult to obtain.</p>
<p>But perhaps this tactic, at least, can be subverted?</p>
<p>To work properly, a pressure cooker needs to have a tight seal at 100 degrees Celsius and in the presence of steam.  The temperature and pressure build up slowly, over minutes. A bomber, by contrast, wants a vessel that has a tight seal at (initially) much lower temperatures, sustains that seal under a very rapid build up of pressure over a tiny fraction of a second, and does so even when there&#8217;s no substantial amount of steam, compared to other gasses released in the explosion. In short, the physical conditions encountered while cooking are very different from those in a nascent bomb.</p>
<p>So, inventors: can you design a pressure cooker that is safe and effective for cooking in the home, but has a seal that will instantly and completely fail if used in a bomb?</p>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s not obvious a redesign is of much use. Perhaps there are many simple substitutes for pressure cookers that are only a bit more expensive and only a bit more trouble to obtain. But still, why make it easy for mass murderers?</p>
<p>Those in the United States will recognize some shards of irony embedded in this question.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The greater New York region, having been broken into disconnected and damaged pieces by Hurricane/Nor&#8217;Easter Sandy, is still reassembling itself.  Every day sees improvements to electrical grids and mass transit and delivery of goods, though there have been many hard lessons about insufficient preparations.  Here&#8217;s an impressive challenge: over a million people and thousands of businesses lack electrical power; therefore many of them are running generators, to stay warm, keep food cold, and so forth; but the generators require fuel, typically diesel or gasoline; and so there is a greater need for fuel than usual; but a significant fraction of the petrol stations can&#8217;t pump fuel for their customers&#8230; because they lack electrical power and don&#8217;t have their own generators. These and other nasty surprises of post-storm recovery should be widely noted by policy makers and the public everywhere, especially in places that, like New York when I was a child, rarely experience disasters.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, another storm (a simple nor&#8217;easter) is now forecast for mid-week. While much weaker than the last, it is potentially still a dangerous situation for a region whose defenses are still being repaired.  <a title="Sandy: Amazing.  Science: Amazing." href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/10/31/sandy-science-amazing/" target="_blank">As was the case with Sandy</a>, the new storm was already signaled a week in advance by the ECMWF (<a href="http://www.ecmwf.int" target="_blank">European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasting</a>), the current European weather-forecasting computer program or &#8220;model&#8221;.  Confidence in the prediction has been growing, but still, predictions so far in advance do change.  Also one must keep in mind that a shift in the storm&#8217;s track of one or two hundred miles or so could very much change its impact, so the consequences of this storm, even if it occurs, are still very uncertain.  But again we are reminded, as we were last week, that <a title="Guest Post: Anand Gnanadesikan, Oceanographer" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/10/29/guest-post-anand-gnanadesikan-oceanographer/" target="_blank">weather forecasting has dramatically improved compared to thirty years ago</a>; the possibility of a significant storm can now often be noted a week in advance.</p>
<p>What is this European ECMWF model? what is its competitor, the US-based GFS (<a href="http://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/index.php" target="_blank">Global Forecast System</a>) model? And what about the other models that also get used?   All of these are computer programs for forecasting the weather; all of them use the same basic weather data as their starting point, and all have the same basic physics of weather built into their computer programs.  So what makes them different, and more or less reliable than one another?  I asked one of my commenters, Dan D., about this after <a title="Sandy: Amazing.  Science: Amazing." href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/10/31/sandy-science-amazing/" target="_blank">my last post</a>.  Here&#8217;s what he said, along with my best (and hopefully accurate) attempts at translation for less experienced readers:<span id="more-4873"></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#339966;"><em>Both the GFS and ECMWF models are global models based on the primitive equations (i.e. the Navier-Stokes equations plus the thermodynamic energy equation and mass conservation equation), and both initialize their grids with mostly the same atmospheric data gathered from around the globe.</em></span></p>
<p>Editor&#8217;s translation: this means that they use the basic physics equations for the motion of fluids (such as air and water vapor), of energy, and of mass; and they both start with the same type of weather data taken from around the world.</p>
<p><span style="color:#339966;"><em>One main difference between the two is the grid resolution. The GFS runs at a grid resolution of roughly 27 km in the horizontal, while the ECMWF runs at roughly 16 km (technically both don’t actually use grids, but rather spectral decomposition; the above are the effective grid spacings). All other things being equal, having a finer grid spacing will generally improve your forecast, since you can resolve more of the relevant weather features at smaller scales. This is assuming that your assumptions about the subgrid scale features are still valid when you change the grid resolution, which is a big assumption. There are other caveats, but I won’t go there.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Editor&#8217;s translation: the atmosphere is far too complicated to be simulated in great detail by a computer program; there just aren&#8217;t big enough computers for that.  Instead, every computer program is designed to make approximations and simplifications.  The approximations made by the ECMWF allow the program to keep track of more of the small details of what the atmosphere is doing, compared to the GFS; this <em>may</em> allow the ECMWF to be more accurate, although this depends on whether its assumptions are ok in other ways.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#339966;"><em>The other big difference between the ECMWF and the GFS, and probably the more significant one, is the method of initialization. Both use statistical variational techniques whereby weather observations are statistically optimally combined (in the least-squares sense) with a background “guess” field for the model state variables (such as temperature, moisture, wind speed and direction, etc.). The GFS takes observations centered around the given initialization time (such as 0000 UTC) and makes an analysis at a single time, using a technique known as 3DVAR. This analysis is then fed into the model grid and the forecast is launched from there. The ECMWF does a very similar thing, except that instead of utilizing an analysis at a single time, it actually uses an enhanced technique known as 4DVAR, wherein the model itself is run forward and backward in time over a certain interval (I think it’s on the order of 6 hours or so, I’d have to check), assimilating observations from within that entire window. The forecast “trajectory” is optimally corrected over several forward-backward iterations to best fit the “trajectory” of the observations within that time window. The final analysis valid at the end of that window is then used to make the subsequent forecast. Because 4DVAR makes use of a longer time window and tries to correct the model forecast trajectory, while 3DVAR merely tries to correct an initial guess valid at a single time, the former generally yields a much more accurate final analysis. The disadvantage is that 4DVAR is far more computationally expensive than 3DVAR, and one needs to create an adjoint (backward-in-time version) of the entire forecast model code, which is nothing short of a nightmare for these very complex codes.</em></span></p>
<p>Editor&#8217;s translation: a useful analogy here would be this: it is as though the GFS is looking at a snapshot of the atmosphere and using the information to predict the future, while the ECMWF is looking at a short video of the atmosphere and making sure that its prediction of the future is consistent with the whole video clip.  This technique, while difficult to implement, assures that ECMWF is more accurate.</p>
<p><span style="color:#339966;"><em>Both of the above contribute to generally superior forecasts by the ECMWF for most situations (in fact, I think a study was done not so long ago in which the ECMWF 4DVAR was used to initialize the GFS forecast model; the results showed a significant improvement in the GFS forecasts, nearly the same accuracy as the typical ECMWF. I’ll see if I can dig it up). The next obvious question is why the GFS doesn’t follow suit with using 4DVAR and higher resolution. The reasons are complex, but partly because (as I see it, at least) the ECMWF center only has to deal with one model, while the U.S. weather enterprise is concerned with multiple models at different scales, and thus has to spread their resources more thinly. The full GFS output is also freely available to anyone, while the ECMWF output is not. Personally, I’d like us in the U.S. to focus on a more unified weather modeling framework, while still keeping everything open access.</em></span></p>
<p>Editor&#8217;s note: I don&#8217;t really know exactly what this means, but it sounds as though the US system is trying to do more than the European one, while the Europeans, while being more focused, have been able to develop more advanced simulation techniques.  Not sure about this.</p>
<p><span style="color:#339966;"><em>Finally, what makes the modern versions of the GFS/ECMWF so much better than their predecessors is a combination of increasing model resolution, better numerical solution techniques, better physical parameterizations of clouds and precipitation, radiation, surface fluxes, and the like, and better initialization procedures (such as 4DVAR). The basic equations that the models are based on, however, have not changed much, only the solution details and how we handle the complex parameterizations of the other important physical phenomena not directly related to fluid flow.</em></span></p>
<p>Editor&#8217;s translation: Although the basic physics that goes into the newer simulation tools isn&#8217;t that different from what was in the older ones, there have been many incremental improvements, on many different fronts.  In other words, it was many small steps, rather than one big one, that makes the newer models better.</p>

<p>As Sandy approaches the coast I am very thankful for my former colleagues at the <a href="http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/" target="_blank">Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Lab</a> who have spent decades trying to make better predictions of tropical cyclones. And the colleagues around the world who have spent decades developing the techniques of observing and modeling the physics of cyclones. Both the recurving of the storm and the high storm surge (currently already at major flood levels at a number of points between NY and DE) would have taken tens of thousands of people, at a minimum, by surprise. Kurihara&#8217;s first paper in the line of research that led to today&#8217;s prediction (<a href="http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/bibliography/results.php?author=1061" target="_blank" rel="nofollow nofollow">http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/bibliography/results.php?author=1061</a>) was in 1965. It took him almost a decade to get to the first three-dimensional model of a hurricane and another couple of decades to improve the models to the point where they showed useful skill.</p>
<div>Just a little plug &#8212; it is important to remember that this kind of event, low-probability, high impact, is what well-run government is for. Putting together a storm-surge warning system for NY Harbor is not something that a private company is likely to do &#8212; the chances of it being used in any given 10-year period are so small as to make it a worthless investment. And the research that goes into making a forecast like this involves understanding of small-scale turbulence, understanding the transfer of radiation through the atmosphere and its interaction with multiple scatterers and absorbers, figuring out how to put weather satellites into orbit and keep them running, figuring out how to incorporate this information in computer codes, getting these codes to run reproducibly on large numbers of processors&#8230; almost all of this was accomplished by people working on the government dime.</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The big storm of 2012 (at least, we hope it&#8217;s the biggest we&#8217;ll see this year) is approaching the New York City area, and though no one can predict in detail how bad it will be and for whom, there&#8217;s no question that with so much energy to play with, post-tropical quasi-hurricane quasi-nor&#8217;easter Sandy (also called &#8220;Frankenstorm&#8221; in honor of the Halloween holiday) is going to hit some of us very hard in the northeastern United States.  Not that it will be a disaster everywhere in the region.  With hurricane Irene last year, some areas just had a bit of wind and rain, while others had <a href="http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/article/20110830/NEWS07/108300301/From-Waterbury-Wilmington-Vermonters-shocked-by-Irene-s-destruction" target="_blank">tremendous flooding</a> that wiped out towns and roads and houses and history&#8230; and a few dozen lives, too. It will likely be the same this time.</p>
<p>How unusual is this storm?  Several weather forecasters have been quoted as saying that their supercomputer-based forecasting tools, which predicted Sandy to strengthen and become a monster in size, were doing things they&#8217;d never previously seen them do.  Right now, all you have to do is look at the weather map &#8212; the fact that there are <a href="http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2012/graphics/al18/loop_R.shtml" target="_blank">tropical force winds extending over several hundreds of miles,</a> and at the fact that the pressure of the atmosphere at the core of this storm is around 946 millibars and falling &#8212; to know there&#8217;s a lot of energy in this system that has to go somewhere, and is going to be taken out on somebody.   Although this is a Category 1 hurricane in terms of its fastest winds, 946 millibars is what one expects for a strong Category 3 hurricane; 1000 is average atmospheric pressure, and the mid-800s is about as low as it ever gets.  By comparison, the great blizzard of 1993 had a central pressure of about 960 millibars.  The Perfect Storm of 1991 (also a nor&#8217;easter-hurricane hybrid, like Sandy) had a central pressure of 972 millibars.  Anyone who thinks Sandy isn&#8217;t a dangerous storm hasn&#8217;t read enough history.<span id="more-4835"></span></p>
<p>I&#8217;m amazed at how often I hear New York City dwellers make fun of the weather prediction folks and the politicians for having advertised Irene as a dangerous storm, just because it turned out to be rather uneventful in the city proper.  This really involves a misunderstanding of the strengths and weaknesses of weather forecasting.  When the experts make predictions about weather, those predictions always come with the implicit caveat, one that everyone should be aware of, that weather prediction is neither an exact science nor a locally precise one.  It&#8217;s increasingly possible to predict general things for regions, such as that the weather in the northeast is going to become potentially very dangerous, that wind gusts will likely exceed 80 miles per hour in some places, and that it is likely that some locales in the northeast will suffer heavy damage.  But forecasters cannot reliably predict specific things for localities, such as whether the borough of Brooklyn will get 60 mile per hour winds and 3 inches of rain and a 5 foot storm surge &#8212; that&#8217;s more detailed than current scientific knowledge and technique permits.  Predictions with so much detail do get made &#8212; in fact you can look at <a href="http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=40.71980&amp;lon=-73.993&amp;unit=0&amp;lg=english&amp;FcstType=graphical" target="_blank">the current prediction for New York City here</a> &#8212; but one has to understand that such details are very uncertain, and are useful mainly for general guidance.  Fortunately, with somewhat more accuracy, it&#8217;s possible to predict the <em>likely range</em> of specific things: in particular, in this week&#8217;s storm, around Long Island and New York City <a href="http://hudson.dl.stevens-tech.edu/SSWS/d/index.shtml?station=N017" target="_blank">the storm surge</a> could perhaps be as bad as 11 feet, but is very unlikely to be worse than that.  The ability to predict a worst-case scenario saves many lives, by allowing policy-makers to focus on lives and property that are in the worst danger.</p>
<p>Forgotten in all the scorn that is heaped on those who predict the weather and often get the details wrong is how many lives weather forecasters save by getting the rough picture correct.  After all, they predicted that Irene would pass very close to the New York City area &#8212; and it did.  And here&#8217;s Sandy, whose potential to hit the northeast coast, as a very unusual <a href="http://www.climatecentral.org/blogs/how-fujiwhara-effect-will-toss-hurricane-sandy-into-u.s.-15174" target="_blank"><em>westward-</em>traveling (click here to see why)</a> October hurricane, was first noted by the weather forecasters almost a week ago!  This forecast has become increasingly certain as days have gone by, and now all the forecasting methods agree that this will occur.  One must not lose sight of the fact that this achievement is astounding!</p>
<p>Consider that in 1938 a more powerful hurricane, sitting roughly where Sandy is now, suddenly and unexpectedly accelerated northward, and without warning blasted across Long Island and into the state of Rhode Island, with a massive storm surge and very strong winds that left over 500 people dead on what was expected to be a normal afternoon.  With modern methods of weather prediction, the potential for that northward lurch would surely have been known, and many of those lives would have been saved.</p>
<p>And without those modern methods, we would not have been known that today&#8217;s Hurricane Sandy would <a href="http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2012/graphics/al18/loop_5W.shtml" target="_blank">cease yesterday&#8217;s northeastward motion, and turn instead sharply to the northwest</a>.  Instead of preparing last night with mandatory evacuations from low-lying areas, the shut-down of transportation systems, and cancellation of school in large sections of New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Maryland, we&#8217;d all be waking up in New York and its environs expecting a more or less ordinary rainy Monday morning, nonchalantly grabbing our umbrellas and putting raincoats on our kids &#8212; and we&#8217;d be completely unaware of the impending flood-tides and violent winds.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t resist pointing out that for the lives saved today and tomorrow, we can thank investments in scientific research over the past century.  It is physics that provides the tools for our understanding of how weather works, and developments in physics underpin both the devices used to measure the weather and the computers used to predict it.  We should remember that advances in hurricane forecasting didn&#8217;t just fall from the sky, or blow in off the ocean in a strong wind.</p>
