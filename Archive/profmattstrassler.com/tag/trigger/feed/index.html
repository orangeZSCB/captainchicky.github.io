										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="The Trigger: Discarding All But the Gold" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/the-trigger-discarding-all-but-the-gold/">Triggering is an essential part of the Large Hadron Collider [LHC]</a>; there are so many collisions happening each second at the LHC, compared to the number that the experiments can afford to store for later study, that the data about most of the collisions (99.999%) have to be thrown away immediately, completely and permanently within a second after the collisions occur.  The automated filter, partly hardware and partly software, that is programmed to make the decision as to what to keep and what to discard is called &#8220;the trigger&#8221;.  This all sounds crazy, but it&#8217;s necessary, and it works.   Usually.</p>
<p>Let me give you one very simple example of how things can go wrong, and how the ATLAS and CMS experiments [the two general purpose experiments at the LHC] attempted to address the problem.  Before you read this, you may want to read <a title="Final Days of Busy Visit to CERN" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/12/02/final-days-of-busy-visit-to-cern/"><span style="color:#000000;">my last post</span></a>, which gives an overview of what I&#8217;ll be talking about in this one.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m a few days behind (thanks to an NSF grant proposal that had to be finished last week) but I wanted to write a bit more about <a title="Day 2 At CERN" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/11/12/day-2-at-cern/">my visit to CERN</a>, which concluded Nov. 21st in a whirlwind of activity. I was working full tilt on timely issues related to Run 2 of the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC], currently scheduled to start early next May.   (You may recall the LHC has been shut down for repairs and upgrades since the end of 2012.)</p>
<p>A certain fraction of my time for the last decade has been taken up by concerns about the LHC experiments&#8217; ability to observe new long-lived particles, specifically ones that aren&#8217;t affected by <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/">the electromagnetic or strong nuclear forces</a>. (Long-lived particles that <em>are</em> affected by those forces are easier to search for, and are much more constrained by the LHC experiments.  More about them some other time.)</p>
<p>This subject is important to me because it is a classic example of how <a title="The Trigger: Discarding All But the Gold" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/the-trigger-discarding-all-but-the-gold/">the trigger systems</a> at LHC experiments could fail us &#8212; whereby a spectacular signal of a new phenomena could be discarded and lost in the very process of taking and storing the data! If no one thinks carefully about the challenges of finding long-lived particles in advance of running the LHC, we can end up losing a huge opportunity, unnecessarily. Fortunately some of us are thinking about it, but we are small in number. It is an uphill battle for those experimenters within ATLAS and CMS [the two general purpose experiments at the LHC] who are working hard to make sure they have the required triggers available. I can&#8217;t tell you how many times people within the experiments &#8212; even at <a title="At the Naturalness 2014 Conference" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/11/17/at-the-naturalness-2014-conference/">the Naturalness conference</a> I wrote about recently &#8212; have told me &#8220;such efforts are hopeless&#8221;&#8230; despite the fact that their own experiments have actually shown, already in public and in some cases published measurements (including <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1203.1303">this</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1411.6977">this</a>, <a href="http://cds.cern.ch/record/1740972/files/ATLAS-CONF-2014-041.pdf">this</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1411.6530">this</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1409.0746">this</a>, and <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1409.4789">this</a>), that it is not. Conversely, many completely practical searches for long-lived particles have not been carried out, often because there was no trigger strategy able to capture them, or because, despite the events having been recorded, no one at ATLAS or CMS has had time or energy to actually search through their data for this signal.</p>
<p>Now what is meant by &#8220;long-lived particles&#8221;?<span id="more-7789"></span></p>
<p><a title="Most Particles Decay — But Why?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/why-do-particles-decay/most-particles-decay-why/">Most types of particles decay</a> (i.e., disintegrate into lower-mass particles). Any particular <em>type</em> of particle has an <em>average</em> lifetime, though an <strong>individual</strong> one may live a <strong>longer or shorter</strong> life than the average.  A <a title="The Nuclei of Atoms: At the Heart of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-nuclei-of-atoms-at-the-heart-of-matter/">neutron</a>, if found outside a stable <a title="The Nuclei of Atoms: At the Heart of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-nuclei-of-atoms-at-the-heart-of-matter/">atomic nucleus</a>, decays into a proton, and electron and an anti-neutrino after about 15 minutes&#8230; sometimes shorter, sometimes longer, but 15 minutes on average.</p>
<p>In the context of the LHC, the term &#8220;long-lived particle&#8221; doesn&#8217;t mean a particle will outlast you and me! or even a neutron.  It merely that its average lifetime is long enough that, if traveling at a good fraction of the speed of light, it is likely to move a measurable distance before it decays&#8230; i.e. that it lives a <em>trillionth of a second</em> or longer. The ATLAS and CMS experiments, despite being the size of small office buildings, are able to detect when a particle&#8217;s decay occurs a millimeter (about 1/25 of an inch) away, or even less, from the location of the proton-proton collision where it was created. <em>(Pretty amazing, huh? My experimental colleagues are awesome.)</em> This astounding ability is critical in identifying bottom and charm quarks, which often decay at a location separated from the collision point by as little as a millimeter.</p>
<p>In contrast to a neutron, the <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/">Higgs particle</a> which was <a title="Discovery of the Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-discovery-of-the-higgs/">discovered at ATLAS and CMS</a> in 2012 is very short-lived; a typical Higgs particle, from its birth to its death at the LHC, <strong><em>won&#8217;t even travel an atom&#8217;s width</em></strong> from the location at which it was created, living about a billionth of a trillionth of a second. But there are other known particles that are much longer lived, such as the muon. A muon, once produced, will survive for two millionths of a second on average &#8212; during which, if it is traveling at a good fraction of the speed of light*, it can travel a good fraction of a mile.</p>
<p>*<span style="color:#808080;"><em>Due to time dilation, a consequence of relativity à la Einstein, if the muon is traveling very close to the speed of light relative to us, it will actually, from our point of view, live longer and travel further than average. This is why very high energy muons created in cosmic ray collisions high in the atmosphere often are able to travel hundreds of miles, often <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttjkd_E7-58">reaching the Earth&#8217;s surface</a>.</em></span></p>
<p>But the really important question for the LHC is whether it might be able to produce <em>as-yet unknown</em> particles that have long lifetimes. We haven&#8217;t found a long-lived particle for a while &#8212; the bottom quark was the most recently discovered long-lived elementary particle, and that was about 40 years ago &#8212; but we found many before, and why shouldn&#8217;t there be others? Indeed such particles are predicted, with small to moderate certainty, in various speculations that have been considered by theorists over the years, including some creative ideas about the nature of dark matter, certain forms of <a title="Supersymmetry — What Is It?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/supersymmetry-what-is-it/">supersymmetry</a>, various attempts to understand the masses of <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/">the known particles</a>, etc. What got me interested in the problem, back in 2001 or so, is that I noticed that if one takes a broad view, and considers a wider set of variants of these speculative ideas, one quickly sees that <em>long-lived particles are far more common than they are in the most popular variants of these ideas</em>. (After some intermittent research, this observation was finally published in <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0604261">2006 work with Kathryn Zurek</a>.)</p>
<p>In other words, <em>due to cultural biases among scientists, but not due to anything about nature itself, the possibility of long-lived particles was viewed as far more remote than it really is</em>. (Though the biases have improved since 2006, to a certain extent they still remain.) And for this reason, the LHC experiments, as of 2006, had prepared for only a fraction of the possibilities, and were even lacking trigger strategies that could be sensitive to certain types of long-lived particles. The worry was especially acute if the long-lived particles were created mainly in the decays of a lightweight Higgs particle. A Higgs particle of mass 125 GeV/c², such as the one we have in nature, has such low mass-energy (125 GeV) compared to the energy of LHC proton-on-proton collisions (7000 GeV in 2011, 8000 GeV in 2012, and 13,000 GeV starting in 2015) that its decays are generally unspectacular and are difficult to observe; the 2012 discovery of the Higgs required careful trigger design, and this will become even more important for Higgs studies in Run 2. So I have spent a lot of time since 2007 trying to help change the situation, so that we can be sure that, if such particles exist, we will discover them, and if we don&#8217;t find them, we&#8217;ll be confident we did a thorough search and didn&#8217;t just miss one for lack of trying.  To this end, I spent much of my time at CERN giving talks and having extended conversations, both planned and spontaneous, with experimental colleagues at ATLAS and CMS, and discussing the issues with theorist colleagues as well.</p>
<p>I realize this is a bit abstract, so in a day or two I&#8217;ll give you a more detailed example of how a new trigger strategy can be crucial in allowing for the possibility of a discovery of long-lived particles.</p>

(</span>This sensitivity of the Higgs was noted as far back to the early 1980s, though its generality was perhaps only emphasized in the last decade.)<span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">&nbsp; The Higgs particle is very interesting not only on its own, for what it might reveal about the Higgs field (</span><a style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;" title="Why the Higgs Particle&nbsp;Matters" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/why-the-higgs-particle-matters/" target="_blank">on which our very existence depends</a><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">), but also as a potential opportunity for the discovery of currently unknown, lightweight particles, to which it might decay. &nbsp;Such particles might be the keys to unlocking secrets of nature, such as what dark matter is, or maybe even&nbsp;</span><em style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;">(<strong>extreme speculation alert</strong>)</em><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">&nbsp;the </span><a style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;" title="Naturalness and the Standard&nbsp;Model" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/naturalness/" target="_blank">naturalness puzzle</a><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">&nbsp;</span><em style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;">&#8212;&nbsp;</em>very roughly, the puzzle of why&nbsp;the mass of the Higgs particle can be so small compared to the masses of the smallest possible black holes.</p>
<p>The goal of our paper, which is extensive in its coverage (though still not comprehensive &#8212; this is a <strong>very</strong>&nbsp;big subject) is to help our experimental colleagues at ATLAS and CMS, the general purpose experiments at the LHC, decide what to search for in their current (2011-2012) and future (2015-) data, and perhaps assist in their decisions on <a title="The Trigger: Discarding All But the&nbsp;Gold" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/the-trigger-discarding-all-but-the-gold/" target="_blank">triggering strategies</a> for the data collecting run that will begin in 2015. &nbsp;(Sorry, LHCb folks, we haven&#8217;t yet looked at decays where you&#8217;d have an advantage.) And we hope it will guide theorists too, by highlighting important unanswered questions about how to look for certain types of exotic decays. &nbsp;Of course the paper has to go through peer review before it is published, but we hope it will be useful to our colleagues immediately. Time is short; 2015 is not very far away.</p>
<p>Although our paper contains some review of the literature, a number of its results are entirely new. &nbsp;I&#8217;ll tell you more about them after I&#8217;ve recovered, and probably after most people are back from break in January. &nbsp;(Maybe for now, as a teaser, I&#8217;ll just say that one of the strongest limits we obtained, as an estimate based on reinterpreting published ATLAS and CMS data, is that no more than <strong>a few × 10<sup>-4</sup></strong>&nbsp;of Higgs particles decay to a pair of neutral spin-one particles with mass in the 20 &#8211; 62 GeV/c<sup>2</sup> range&#8230; and the experimentalists themselves, by re-analyzing their data, could surely do better than we did!) &nbsp;But for the moment, I&#8217;d simply like to encourage my fellow experts, both from the theory side and the experimental side, to take a look&#8230; comments are welcome.</p>
<p>Finally, I&#8217;d like to congratulate and thank my young colleagues, all of whom are pre-tenure and several of whom are still not professors yet, on their excellent work&#8230; it has been a pleasure to collaborate with them. &nbsp;They led the way, not me. &nbsp;They are (in alphabetical order): David Curtin, Rouven Essig, Stefania Gori, Prerit Jaiswal, Andrey Katz, Tao Liu, Zhen Liu, David McKeen, Jessie Shelton, Ze&#8217;ev Surujon, Brock Tweedie, and Yi-Ming Zhong. They hail from around the world, but they&#8217;ve worked together like family&#8230; a great example of how our international effort to understand nature&#8217;s deep mysteries brings unity of purpose from a diversity of origins.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For those of you curious about why posts have been a little sparse this month and have been wondering what I&#8217;ve been up to, here&#8217;s the latest on what has been an on-going story.</p>
<p>The <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC] is producing lots of new data, and the search for <a title="The Higgs FAQ 1.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/360-2/" target="_blank">the Higgs particle</a> continues at the ATLAS and CMS experiments. We&#8217;re still within Phase 1 of the search for the Higgs particle (<a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2011/12/06/guest-post-matt-strassler-on-hunting-for-the-higgs/" target="_blank">I&#8217;ve described the two main phases here</a> and <a title="Reviewing the Search for the Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/01/24/reviewing-the-search-for-the-higgs/" target="_blank">in more detail here</a>) in which the experiments are trying to discover unequivocally, or exclude unequivocally, the simplest possible form of the Higgs particle, which is called <a title="The Standard Model Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/" target="_blank">the Standard Model Higgs</a>. Phase 1 is well along the way, the experimenters having excluded a Standard Model Higgs particle at any mass except a small range around 125 GeV/c<sup>2</sup>. Within that range there are hints that a Higgs particle might be showing up (see <a title="Holiday Higgs Hints: Confidence-Inspiring or Not?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/holiday-higgs-hints-confidence-inspiring-or-not/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a title="This Week’s Step Forward in the Search for the Higgs Particle" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/02/09/this-weeks-step-forward-in-the-search-for-the-higgs-particle/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a title="Taking Stock: Where is the Higgs Search Now?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/07/taking-stock-where-is-the-higgs-search-now/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a title="The Quiet Higgs Quake at CMS" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/13/the-quiet-higgs-quake-at-cms/" target="_blank">here</a>). Some would say the evidence is significant and are quite convinced already, while others (quite a few of the experimentalists, and a few cautious theorists such as myself) would say the hints are not yet especially significant and are willing to let more data settle the issue. But everyone agrees there&#8217;s a very high chance the issue will be settled in 2012.</p>
<p>At that point, the Higgs search will move toward Phase 2. In fact, in some sense it is already in transition, because <strong>either</strong> there is a Standard Model Higgs particle with a mass near 125 GeV/c<sup>2</sup>, <strong>or</strong> the Higgs particle, if it exists, must be more exotic and complicated &#8212; two possibilities on which we can focus our planning.</p>
<p>One of the most important questions that will be asked (and is already being asked) is whether the particle that is showing up in the 2011 data (if it is really there in the first place) is a Standard Model Higgs or a look-alike Higgs particle that is actually more complicated in some way. <span id="more-3640"></span>This is a crisp and clear question, because the Standard Model <em>(the equations we use to describe and predict the behavior of all <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the known particles and forces</a>)</em> predicts <strong>everything</strong> about the<a title="The Standard Model Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/" target="_blank"> Standard Model Higgs</a> <strong><em>except</em></strong> for its mass. Once its mass is known, all the rates for <a title="Production of the Standard Model Higgs Particle" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/production-of-the-standard-model-higgs-particle/" target="_blank">the various processes in which it is produced</a>, and all the probabilities that it <a title="Decays of the Standard Model Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/decays-of-the-standard-model-higgs/" target="_blank">decays to this or that collection of other particles</a>, are predicted, with a precision that varies between about 1% for the easiest calculations and about 20% for the hardest ones. If</p>
<ul>
<li>it is discovered that any of these rates are not equal to expectations, or</li>
<li>it is discovered there are ways to produce the Higgs that are not expected, or</li>
<li>it is discovered that the Higgs particles can sometimes decay in an unexpected (&#8220;exotic&#8221;) fashion,</li>
</ul>
<p>then <em>it will mean a revolution</em>.  For we will then know that the Higgs particle and Higgs field are more complex than their Standard Model form, and that the Standard Model is not a complete set of equations and must be revised.  It is therefore critical to measure rates of production and decays of Higgs particles as well as possible, both for the processes that the Standard Model predicts will be <em>present</em> <strong>and</strong> for the ones that it predicts will be <em>absent</em>.</p>
<p>During the past few months (even going back to December 14th, right after the <a title="Holiday Higgs Hints: Confidence-Inspiring or Not?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/holiday-higgs-hints-confidence-inspiring-or-not/" target="_blank">holiday Higgs hints</a> were announced at CERN, the LHC&#8217;s laboratory) I&#8217;ve brought up several times (see <a title="Exotic Decays of the Higgs: A High Priority for 2012" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/01/27/exotic-decays-of-the-higgs-a-high-priority-for-2012/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a title="Lightweight Higgs: A `Sensitive Creature’" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/lightweight-higgs-a-sensitive-creature/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a title="At the SEARCH Workshop on the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/18/at-the-search-workshop-on-the-lhc/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a title="Latest from the SEARCH Workshop" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/20/latest-from-the-search-workshop/" target="_blank">here</a>) the possibility that the Higgs particle (or particles) can sometimes decay in an exotic fashion, and emphasized that there are important but tricky opportunities to look for these decays in the coming year. In particular, with hundreds of thousands of Higgs particles expected to be produced in 2012, even very rare exotic decays might in some cases be discoverable. But there are two great challenges.</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Analysis:</strong> First, a <a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#008000;">proton</span></a>-proton collision at the LHC in which a Higgs particle is produced and decays is almost impossible to uniquely identify as such.   There are always other types of collisions, in which no Higgs particle is produced at all, that will mimic the decay of a Higgs. The Higgs decays  can only be picked out <em>statistically</em>, by gathering many similar-looking collisions, and determining that there are more than would be expected in the absence of Higgs particle production. We saw this in the <a title="Holiday Higgs Hints: Confidence-Inspiring or Not?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/holiday-higgs-hints-confidence-inspiring-or-not/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#008000;">holiday Higgs hints</span></a>, where for instance the sign of a Higgs particle decaying to two photons was in the form of a bump on top of a smooth curve &#8212; an excess of collisions consistent with a Higgs decay over a &#8220;background&#8221; of two-photon events from non-Higgs processes. (You can <a title="Why is it Hard to Find the Higgs Particle?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/why-is-it-hard-to-find-the-higgs-particle/a-lightweight-standard-model-higgs-particle/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#008000;">read here</span></a> for more discussion of this case.)  We also <a title="Why The Hints of Higgs Currently Rest on Uncertain Ground" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/why-the-hints-of-higgs-currently-rest-on-uncertain-ground/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#008000;">saw this last summer</span></a> <em>[the data in the article is out of date, but the issues that it addresses remain relevant]</em>, where there was an evanescent hint of a Higgs decaying to a lepton, anti-lepton, neutrino and anti-neutrino. So one must always ask: for a given decay mode of the Higgs, where a Higgs particle disintegrates into a particular collection of other particles, will there be enough Higgs decays (i.e.<strong><em> is there a large enough signal</em></strong>) and will similar-looking background processes be rare enough (i.e. <em><strong>is there a small enough background</strong></em>) so that these decays can be found if they are present, or if absent can be excluded meaningfully.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#800080;"><strong>Triggering:</strong> Second, it isn&#8217;t obvious that these Higgs decays will even be stored for data analysis in the first place. <a title="The Trigger: Discarding All But the Gold" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/the-trigger-discarding-all-but-the-gold/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#800080;">The data from most collisions at the LHC have to be immediately discarded</span></a>; there simply isn&#8217;t enough computer power available to analyze and store all of it. Fortunately, most proton-proton collisions at the LHC are boring: glancing blows, minor smash-ups, collisions in which no unknown phenomena occur. That&#8217;s why <a title="The Trigger: Discarding All But the Gold" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/the-trigger-discarding-all-but-the-gold/" target="_blank">throwing most of the data away, using an intelligent automated algorithm called &#8220;the trigger&#8221;, is not crazy</a>. But there is always the risk that the trigger strategy used to choose the one in a million collisions (i.e., the few hundred collisions per second) worth keeping will &#8220;throw the baby out with the bathwater&#8221;. The experimentalists worry about this a lot; theorists, in my view, ought to worry about it more than most of them do. The problem with exotic Higgs decays is that they lie in the danger zone. The particles produced in the decay of a Higgs with mass of 125 GeV/c<sup>2</sup> have relatively low energy and &#8220;transverse momentum&#8221; <em>(i.e., momentum in the directions perpendicular to the directions of the incoming protons)</em> &#8212; typically something near to or less than the 125 GeV or so of the Higgs mass-energy (i.e. E = m c<sup>2</sup> energy). Unfortunately, that much energy and momentum is produced in over a million boring collisions each second at ATLAS and CMS. From this huge reservoir of collision data, a trigger strategy must be found that winnows the number of boring collisions down by a factor of over ten thousand, yet still manages to keep a large fraction of the exotic Higgs decays, should they be present.  And whatever this strategy is, it has to be executed in much less than a second, typically using only partial and imperfect information about each collision.  It&#8217;s a tall order!</span></p>
<p>As a collider theorist familiar both with the theories (of which there are many) that predict exotic decays of various types (of which there are many), and also with the challenges of triggering (of which there are many), my highest priority over the past six months has been to persuade my colleagues at CMS and ATLAS that a program to search for exotic decays of the Higgs particle represents both a great opportunity for research using 2012 data and potentially a big problem for the standard trigger strategies. (<a title="Exotic Decays of the Higgs: A High Priority for 2012" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/01/27/exotic-decays-of-the-higgs-a-high-priority-for-2012/" target="_blank">I wrote about the opportunities and the potential problems back in January.</a>) After some weeks of work on the subject, I summarized my concerns in a document that I sent around in mid-March to experts at ATLAS and CMS.</p>
<p>But at that point, although my studies indicated there might be a problem with the triggering strategy, I hadn&#8217;t had time to show that fixing the problem would actually have any real benefit as far as potential discoveries. In particular, it hadn&#8217;t been shown (and some leading members of ATLAS and CMS were not convinced that it <em>could</em> be shown) that <span style="color:#008000;">the signals could be large enough, and the backgrounds small enough</span>, that <span style="color:#993366;">collecting these collisions using new triggering strategies</span> would actually allow exotic decays <span style="color:#000000;">to be discovered in 2012.</span> And since setting up and testing new triggers is a huge amount of work, the skeptics did not want ATLAS or CMS members to be wasting time on what seemed to them to be potentially a fool&#8217;s errand.</p>
<p>This point of view came up in public <a title="At the SEARCH Workshop on the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/18/at-the-search-workshop-on-the-lhc/" target="_blank">during the SEARCH workshop</a>, where I made a few remarks about triggering and exotic decays, and where some of my colleagues at ATLAS and CMS politely but firmly made their own skeptical positions clear.  We all agreed that the case needed to be made more convincing.</p>
<p>In response, a number of younger theorists who heard this discussion <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/03/20/latest-from-the-search-workshop/" target="_blank">met during the SEARCH workshop</a>, and a small group was informally established to address the objections of the skeptics. Is it true that <span style="color:#993366;">more efficient triggering on exotic decays of Higgs particles</span> could perhaps produce <span style="color:#008000;">signals large enough, with backgrounds small enough, to allow potential discoveries</span> in 2012?</p>
<p>These types of studies are not easy and take a lot of time and personnel, and all of the young theorists involved had other important things to do too. But conversely, we had no time to waste; if our concerns are well-founded, then unless they are dealt with right away, within a month from now, it will be too late: the majority of the 2012 data will be taken without the appropriate adjustments to the triggering strategy.  So we&#8217;ve been rushing, and we&#8217;ve started sending our results, piecemeal, to the ATLAS and CMS folks. We&#8217;re doing this as soon as our studies are roughly completed, once we have high confidence in them, but well before we&#8217;d be entirely comfortable submitting them to a journal for peer review&#8230; there&#8217;s just no time to do all the final checks that one would do under normal circumstances.</p>
<p>The good news is that I think our first studies give examples of cases for which the concerns of the skeptics are unwarranted. In particular, we think we&#8217;ve shown with reasonable confidence that searches for decays of the Higgs to two unusual clusters of particles would indeed become more sensitive if new trigger strategies were put in place.</p>
<p><em>More precisely (for experts), improved triggering on events with two unusual jet-like objects, with or without missing transverse momentum, appears likely to increase sensitivity significantly, relative to what would be possible were one to rely only on the &#8220;baseline&#8221; events from &#8220;associated production&#8221;, in which a Higgs is produced along with a W or Z particle, and in which triggering is based on any lepton or anti-lepton(s) produced in the decay of the W or Z.  Classes of &#8220;unusual jets&#8221;, and possible triggering strategies, are described <a title="Decay to Unusual Jets" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-standard-model-higgs/lightweight-higgs-a-sensitive-creature/decay-to-unusual-jets/">here</a>. <span style="color:#808080;"> (<span style="color:#888888;">Please f<em><em>eel free to contact me if you&#8217;re a member of ATLAS or CMS and want a copy of the current draft document.</em> )</em></span></span></em></p>
<p>Our results are certainly not comprehensive, and we don&#8217;t expect such positive conclusions for all manner of exotic Higgs decays. But I think we have shown convincingly that the skeptics&#8217; objections do not hold universally, and this should be enough to motivate some attention to the triggering issues.</p>
<p><em>My current collaborators in this effort: Tomer Volansky (at the Weizmann Institute), Jessie Shelton (Yale), Andrey Katz (Harvard), and (from Stony Brook) Rouven Essig, David Curtin, and Prerit Jaiswal, along with <em> Raffaele Tito D&#8217;Agnolo</em> (Scuola Normale Superiore, INFN Pisa, and CERN). Also, a number of our experimental colleagues at ATLAS and CMS have provided advice that has helped us ensure our studies actually are meaningful, sensible, and (we hope) valuable; thank you for your assistance!</em></p>
