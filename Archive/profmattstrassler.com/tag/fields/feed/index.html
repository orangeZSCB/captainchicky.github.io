										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the concepts that&#8217;s playing a big role in contemporary discussions of the laws of nature is the notion of &#8220;vacua&#8221;, the plural of the word &#8220;vacuum&#8221;. I&#8217;ve just completed <a title="Theories and Vacua" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/theories-and-vacua/" target="_blank">an article about what vacua are, and what it means for a universe to have multiple vacua, or for a theory that purports to describe a universe to predict that it has multiple vacua</a>. In case you don&#8217;t want to plunge right in to that article, here&#8217;s a brief summary of why this is interesting and important.</p>
<p>Outside of physics, most people think of a vacuum as being the absence of air. For physicists thinking about the laws of nature, &#8220;vacuum&#8221; means space that has been emptied of <em>everything</em> &#8212; at least, emptied of <strong><em>everything that can actually be removed</em></strong>. That certainly means removing all particles from it. But even though vacuum implies emptiness, it turns out that empty space isn&#8217;t really that empty. There are always fields in that space, fields like the electric and magnetic fields, the electron field, the quark field, the Higgs field. And those fields are always up to something.</p>
<p>First, all of the fields are subject to &#8220;<a title="Quantum Fluctuations and Their Energy" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/quantum-fluctuations-and-their-energy/" target="_blank">quantum fluctuations</a>&#8221; &#8212; a sort of unstoppable jitter that nothing in our quantum world can avoid.  <em>[Sometimes these fluctuations are referred to as <a title="Virtual Particles: What are they?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/virtual-particles-what-are-they/" target="_blank">&#8220;virtual particles&#8221;; but despite the name, those aren&#8217;t particles</a>.  Real particles are well-behaved, long-lived ripples in those fields; fluctuations are much more random.]</em> These fluctuations are always present, in any form of empty space.</p>
<p>Second, and more important for our current discussion, some of the fields <strong>may have average values that aren&#8217;t zero</strong>. [In our own familiar form of empty space, the <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">Higgs field has a non-zero average value</a>, one that causes many of <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the known elementary particles</a> to acquire a mass (i.e. a <a title="The Two Definitions of “Mass”, And Why I Use Only One" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/more-on-mass/the-two-definitions-of-mass-and-why-i-use-only-one/" target="_blank">rest mass</a>).] And it&#8217;s because of this that the notion of vacuum can have a plural: forms of empty space can differ, even for a single universe, if the fields of that universe can take different possible average values in empty space. If a given universe can have more than one form of empty space, we say that &#8220;it has more than one vacuum&#8221;.</p>
<p>There are reasons to think our own universe might have more than one form of vacuum &#8212; more than just the one we&#8217;re familiar with. It is possible that the Standard Model (the equations used to describe all of <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the known elementary particles, and all the known forces except gravity</a>) is a good description of our world, even up to much higher energies than our current particle physics experiments can probe. Physicists can predict, using those equations, how many forms of empty space our world would have. And their calculations show that our world would have (at least) two vacua: the one we know, along with a second, exotic one, with a much larger average value for the Higgs field. (Remember, this prediction is based on the assumption that the Standard Model&#8217;s equations apply in the first place.)  An electron in empty space would have a much larger mass than the electrons we know and love (and need!)</p>
<p>The future of the universe, and our understanding of how the universe came to be, might crucially depend on this second, exotic vacuum. <a title="Theories and Vacua" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/theories-and-vacua/" target="_blank">Today&#8217;s article</a> sets the stage for future articles, which will provide an explanation of why the vacua of the universe play such a central role in our understanding of nature at its most elemental.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Familiar throughout our international culture, the &#8220;Big Bang&#8221; is well-known as the theory that scientists use to describe and explain the history of the universe. But the theory is not a single conceptual unit, and there are parts that are more reliable than others.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to understand that the theory &#8212; a set of equations describing how the universe <em>(more precisely, the <strong><em>observable patch</em></strong> of our universe, which may be a tiny fraction of the universe)</em> changes over time, and leading to sometimes precise predictions for what should, if the theory is right, be observed by humans in the sky &#8212; actually consists of different periods, some of which are far more speculative than others.  In the more speculative early periods, we must use equations in which we have limited confidence at best; moreover, data relevant to these periods, from observations of the cosmos and from particle physics experiments, is slim to none. In more recent periods, our confidence is very, very strong.</p>
<p>In my <a title="History of the Universe" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/" target="_blank">&#8220;History of the Universe&#8221; article</a> <em>[see also my related articles on <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">cosmic inflation</a>, on the <a title="Hot Big Bang" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/hot-big-bang/" target="_blank">Hot Big Bang</a>, and on the <a title="Before Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/before-inflation/" target="_blank">pre-inflation period</a>; also a comment that <a title="Big Bang: Expansion, NOT Explosion" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/big-bang-expansion-not-explosion/" target="_blank">the Big Bang is an expansion, <strong>not</strong> an explosion!</a>]</em>, the following figure appears, though without the colored zones, which I&#8217;ve added for this post. The colored zones emphasize what we know, what we suspect, and what we don&#8217;t know at all.</p>

In each colored zone, the degree of confidence and the observational/experimental source of that confidence is indicated. Three different possible starting points for the &#8220;Big Bang&#8221; are noted at the bottom; note that individual scientists may mean different things by the term.  <em>(Caution: there is a subtlety in the use of the words &#8220;Extremely Cold&#8221;; there are subtle quantum effects that I haven&#8217;t yet written about that complicate this notion.)</em></p></div>
<p>Notice that in the figure, I don&#8217;t measure time from the start of the universe.  That&#8217;s because I don&#8217;t <em>know</em> how or when the universe started (and in particular, the notion that <a title="Did The Universe Really Begin With a Singularity?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/21/did-the-universe-begin-with-a-singularity/" target="_blank">it started from a singularity</a>, or worse, <a title="Big Bang: Expansion, NOT Explosion" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/big-bang-expansion-not-explosion/" target="_blank">an exploding &#8220;cosmic egg&#8221;</a>, is simply an over-extrapolation to the past and a misunderstanding of what the theory actually says.) Instead I measure time from the start of the <strong>Hot</strong> Big Bang in the observable patch of the universe.  <em>I also don&#8217;t even know precisely when the Hot Big Bang started, but the uncertainty on that initial time (relative to other events) is less than one second &#8212; so all the times I&#8217;ll mention, which are much longer than that, aren&#8217;t affected by this uncertainty.</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll now take you through the different confidence zones of the Big Bang, from the latest to the earliest, as indicated in the figure above.</p>
<p><span id="more-7537"></span></p>
<p><strong>The Green Zone: Confidence</strong></p>
<p>A key clue that the observable patch of the universe was once hot and dense, and cooling as it expanded &#8212; i.e. that there <em>was</em> a Hot Big Bang period (preceded perhaps by cosmic inflation, but we don&#8217;t need to focus on that yet) &#8212; is the presence in the universe of the cosmic microwave background [CMB]. From all parts of the sky, an easily detectable sea of electromagnetic radiation in the form of microwaves (photons with energy about 1000 times less than photons of visible light) is streaming across the universe, and onto the Earth. Not only is the CMB a broad clue as to the universe&#8217;s past, it is also a key tool for scientists to use in finding even more precise and focused clues. Much of the history of the observable patch is imprinted in the details of the CMB.</p>
<p>A prediction of the Hot Big Bang is that the microwaves are just a sign of past heat, and of nothing else. Specifically, if you measure the microwave photons&#8217; energy, and plot <em>the amount of energy</em> coming from a patch of sky due to photons <em>of a particular frequency</em>, you should see the same plot (a &#8220;black-body spectrum&#8221;, as it is called) as you would see for photons emitted by a cold piece of ice or rock or metal.  [Yes, ice at 2.7 degrees C above <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/01/07/happy-chilly-new-year/" target="_blank">absolute zero</a> does glow in microwaves.]  The fact that the COBE satellite&#8217;s data agrees closely with the prediction of a black-body spectrum (shown in the figure) is overwhelming evidence that there was a Hot Big Bang going on at the time that atoms first formed, when the observable patch of the universe became transparent to light &#8212; a time now believed to be about 380,000 years after the Hot Big Bang began.</p>

Data from the COBE satellite is the red crosses; the green curve is the prediction of a black-body spectrum.</p></div>
<p>The most powerful evidence that a simple view of the Hot Big Bang is correct even earlier is the success of the theory (i.e. equations) for nucleosynthesis: the formation of <a title="The Nuclei of Atoms: At the Heart of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-nuclei-of-atoms-at-the-heart-of-matter/" target="_blank">atomic nuclei</a> for the lightest atoms during the Hot Big Bang.  <em>(Note the atoms themselves formed hundreds of thousands of years later, when the temperature was cool enough for <a title="Electrons: On the Outskirts of Atoms" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/electrons-on-the-outskirts-of-atoms/" target="_blank">the nuclei to capture electrons</a>.)</em>  The equations of the Hot Big Bang include</p>
<ul>
<li>Einstein&#8217;s version of gravity and</li>
<li>the &#8220;quantum field theory&#8221; used to describe <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the known particles and non-gravitational forces.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These equations can be used to calculate how abundant certain light atoms should be, if there was a Hot Big Bang.  Specifically, one can compute the ratios of how much hydrogen <em>(normal <strong>and</strong> heavy [&#8220;deuterium&#8221;])</em>, helium <em>(normal [&#8220;helium-4&#8221;] <strong>and</strong> light [&#8220;helium-3&#8221;])</em>, and lithium should be present in pristine parts of the observable patch, if the atomic nuclei of those elements were mainly forged during the cooling stages of the Hot Big Bang. If the elements other than hydrogen were only formed in stars, then there should be very little helium and virtually no deuterium in the observable patch of the universe. (Deuterium is actually destroyed in stars.) But in a cooling Hot Big Bang, a lot of helium &#8212; about 1/4 of the amount of hydrogen &#8212; and a small but measurable amount of deuterium should be produced.</p>
<p>These predictions of the Hot Big Bang depend in great detail on our understanding of particle physics and gravity &#8212; <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">of the weak nuclear force, the strong nuclear force, the electromagnetic force, the gravitational force (in Einstein&#8217;s version of it) and on the properties of neutrinos, electrons, photons, protons and neutrons.</a> And the numbers work! The amount of helium, relative to ordinary hydrogen, is predicted to be in the 20 &#8211; 25% range; deuterium is predicted to be in the range of one part in 10,000 to 100,000, helium-3 a factor of 10 smaller than that, and lithium in the part per 10 billion range. The data agree!</p>

<p>That these predictions agree with observations of the distant cosmos (see the figure below) provides a strong argument that the Hot Big Bang really occurred, and was originally hot enough to break apart nuclei.  That means that temperatures were initially at least hot enough that the typical particle had an energy of about 0.001 <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/" target="_blank">GeV</a>, which would have happened a few minutes after the Hot Big Bang began.  More precise measurements even help us understand how much ordinary matter there is in the observable patch of the universe, with results that agree with other measurements of the same quantity.</p>
<p>For this reason, I&#8217;ve marked the nucleosynthesis period and what follows it in <span style="color:#008000;">green</span>, to emphasize that we have strong observational evidence that the Hot Big Bang did occur, and was so hot &#8212; hot enough to destroy atomic nuclei &#8212; that the atomic nuclei around us today had to form from scratch as the temperature cooled.</p>
<p><strong>The Yellow Zone: Extrapolating a Bit Using Particle Physics</strong></p>
<p>However, for times before nucleosynthesis, the arguments are weaker. We don&#8217;t have much direct evidence for what was taking place. But we have a lot of knowledge about particle physics, up to energies of a few hundred GeV, thanks to the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC] and its predecessors over the last few decades.  So if we assume that the Hot Big Bang started at temperatures so high that a typical particle would have had an energy of a few hundred <a title="GeV and TeV" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/some-technical-concepts/a-technical-concept-gev-and-tev/" target="_blank">GeV</a>, we can calculate the observable patch&#8217;s properties from that temperature downward. At such a high temperature,</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">Higgs field would have been &#8220;off&#8221;</a>, so <a title="The Known Particles — If The Higgs Field Were Zero" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/the-known-particles-if-the-higgs-field-were-zero/" target="_blank">many particles would not have had their usual masses</a>; and</li>
<li>also, separately, quarks and gluons would have been free to roam.</li>
</ul>
<p>As the temperature cooled, we can calculate <em>(now that <a title="Discovery of the Higgs" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-discovery-of-the-higgs/" target="_blank">we know the Higgs particle&#8217;s mass</a>, and if we assume there aren&#8217;t any lightweight particles that we don&#8217;t know about)</em> that first the Higgs field would have turned &#8220;on&#8221;, making the weak nuclear force henceforth weak; and then, a bit later, the strong nuclear force would have become very strong, so that quarks and gluons and anti-quarks would have been trapped henceforth and forever into <a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/" target="_blank">protons</a>, <a title="The Nuclei of Atoms: At the Heart of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-nuclei-of-atoms-at-the-heart-of-matter/" target="_blank">neutrons</a>, anti-protons and anti-neutrons, as well as other very short-lived <a title="What’s a Hadron?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-hadron-as-in-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">hadrons</a>.</p>
<p>However, we can&#8217;t yet directly confirm <em>by cosmological observation</em> that this is true.  It&#8217;s not entirely impossible that there was something odd and unknown about the universe that makes some of these conclusions premature. Someday we may be able to be more certain, but not yet. So in this time period, starting just before the Higgs field turns on and going until nucleosynthesis, we have a highly educated guess as to what was happening, though no direct experimental checks.  That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve marked this time period in <span style="color:#333333;">yellow</span>.</p>
<p><strong>The Orange Zone: What Started the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Hot</span> Big Bang?</strong></p>
<p>Even earlier? Well, at even higher temperatures we don&#8217;t know the particle physics with confidence; we&#8217;d need particle accelerators more powerful than the LHC.  To figure out what happened in the Big Bang in detail, we have to make assumptions about the particles available, without any way to check them. But still, we are not without information, because we do have an experimental probe: the CMB itself.</p>
<p>It is a remarkable fact that the CMB is incredibly uniform, to one part in 100,000. That&#8217;s already information, and explaining why it&#8217;s true is one of the arguments in favor of <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">cosmic inflation</a>.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s much, much more information in the <em>imperfections</em> in that uniformity. The non-uniformities, which were discovered by the COBE satellite, have been studied in detail by the WMAP and Planck satellites, along with many other experiments from the ground. And it was in studying the non-uniformities in the CMB and their tiny bit of polarization that BICEP2 made <a title="BICEP2: New Evidence Of Cosmic Inflation!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/bicep2-new-evidence-of-cosmic-inflation/" target="_blank">the big (but <del>unconfirmed</del> now discredited) discovery that was announced last week</a> (here&#8217;s some <a title="A Primer On Today’s Events" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/a-primer-on-todays-events/" target="_blank">background information on that discovery, in the form of FAQs, that you may find useful</a>).</p>
<p>The photons in the CMB are astonishingly sensitive. There are very few things that affect them, and fortunately, most of the things that do are relics from the extremely early periods of the observable patch of the universe. It&#8217;s an unexpected gift for scientists that this is true! The CMB photons were created about 380,000 years after the Hot Big Bang, and yet they give us insight into the entire period before that, all the way back to a period <em>just before</em> the Hot Big Bang!!!  (They also can give us important insights into what happened <em>after</em> 380,000 years, too.)  To me, this incredibly sensitivity of the CMB is one of the most amazing natural phenomena in all of science&#8230; and it has been the key to progress in cosmology in recent years.</p>
<p>Detailed measurements of the CMB have increasingly given us insight into the zone marked in orange, where we don&#8217;t have any particle physics data &#8212; just guesses, and calculations based on those guesses.  The reason insights have been possible is that our calculations rely on very general properties of the Hot Big Bang and the pre-Hot Big Bang period to make predictions.  What I mean by this is that these calculations begin with very simple assumptions about the patterns of non-uniformities that were present at the start of the Hot Big Bang, and then we check if these assumptions give predictions for non-uniformities in the CMB that agree with data.  They do!  This is shown in the figure below, where predictions of the Hot Big Bang theory, <em>with these simple assumptions about the starting point</em>, are compared with data from the Planck satellite. (Similar but less precise measurements were made before Planck, by WMAP and a number of ground-based experiments.)</p>

<p>Thus, simple assumptions about the non-uniformities at the start of the Hot Big Bang seem to be right, more or less.  This lends support to the hypothesis of cosmic inflation, which can produce simple non-uniformities. But it&#8217;s not convincing, because one can imagine simple non-uniformities arising in some other way.  There is at least one alternative &#8212; the ekpyrotic universe &#8212; that is also largely consistent with this data, and there might have been others that no one has thought of.  Meanwhile, there were many qualitatively different forms that cosmic inflation might take, some of which could have been consistent with universes quite different from those with a simple Big Bang.  For example, the data has been consistent with universes that, at temperatures a bit higher than reached in the yellow zone in the figure, have more spatial dimensions than the three we&#8217;re used to. So the number of possible options in the orange zone has been very large, and the degree of speculation involved has been very high.</p>

<p>This <del>may have changed</del> with <a title="BICEP2: New Evidence Of Cosmic Inflation!" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/17/bicep2-new-evidence-of-cosmic-inflation/">BICEP2s new measurement,</a> which <del>gives</del> unfortunately did not give powerful new evidence for cosmic inflation through inflation&#8217;s generation of gravitational waves&#8230; assuming the measurement itself, and the interpretation of the measurement, both hold up over time.  <em>[The interpretation did not.]</em> Since a measurable amount of gravitational waves can only be produced, as far as we know, if a period of inflation occurred and was <a title="If It Holds Up, What Might BICEP2′s Discovery Mean?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/18/if-its-holds-up-what-might-bicep2s-discovery-mean/" target="_blank">driven by a <strong>very</strong> large amount of &#8220;dark `energy&#8217; &#8220;</a>, BICEP2&#8217;s result may rule out all known alternatives to inflation, and significantly narrow down the options for how inflation may have occurred, excluding many of the more radical options as well as many simple ones. As such, it may increase confidence in the inflation hypothesis to change the color of the orange zone to yellow, or even, as more measurements come in and become more precise, to green.  <em>[But it did not.]</em></p>
<p>However, let&#8217;s not jump to conclusions until the measurement is confirmed with more data and by other observing teams.  <em>[You see how important it is that I write these cautionary caveats in my articles.  I have seen many measurements come and go; the fraction that stick is much less than half.]</em></p>
<p><strong>The Red Zone: Scientific Guesswork</strong></p>
<p>But BICEP2 can really only tell us about <strong><em>the late stage and exit from inflation</em></strong>. If we go deep into the inflationary period and try to go earlier, into the red zone in the figure, we face two problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>we don&#8217;t have any experimental probes of this early time, and</li>
<li>we don&#8217;t know which particle physics and/or gravity equations we should be using.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not yet have any cosmological observations that access this time period; the CMB photons bring us back to the late stage of inflation, but not further. We cannot infer much yet from CMB measurements about the &#8220;inflaton&#8221; field (and its particle) that is supposed to play the dominant particle-physics role during inflation, and we have no idea what other types of fields it may interact with, so it is hard to be sure what type of process got inflation started. Meanwhile, theoretical physics doesn&#8217;t help much either. We can try assuming that string theory is the true theory of quantum gravity in our world, but if we do that, we still find the equations are hard to solve and give, at best, a variety of possibilities. And trying to work in greater generality, without assuming string theory, doesn&#8217;t help; the calculations are still ambiguous and difficult. This doesn&#8217;t stop theoretical physicists from making educated, scientific guesses &#8212; i.e., speculations backed with concrete equations and calculations. But until we get some data that allows us to distinguish the many possibilities, we can&#8217;t say for sure what was actually happening back then.</p>
<p>So if people tells you that the universe <em>started</em> in such and such a way, perhaps &#8220;<a title="Did The Universe Really Begin With a Singularity?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/21/did-the-universe-begin-with-a-singularity/" target="_blank">with a singularity</a>&#8221; or &#8220;with a quantum fluctuation out of nothing&#8221; or &#8220;in the Big Crunch (i.e. the collapse) of a previous phase of the universe&#8221;, remember that they&#8217;re telling you about the <span style="color:#ff0000;">red zone</span>. They&#8217;re neglecting to tell you that what they&#8217;re saying is pure theory, with neither an experiment to back it up nor a clear theoretical reason to believe their suggestion is unique and preferable over someone else&#8217;s alternative. Only a bit later in cosmic history, once we focus on the late stages of inflation, and forward in time from there to nucleosynthesis, do we have both data (cosmological observation and particle physics collisions) and reasonably reliable theory (Einstein&#8217;s theory of gravity plus the Standard Model of particle physics). Our confidence grows as time moves forward, the observable patch of the universe cools, and physics becomes of a sort that we&#8217;ve tested in numerous experiments already.</p>
<p>From this, I hope that you can see that the Big Bang Theory really isn&#8217;t a single, undifferentiated structure.  The most reliable part of the theory is that there was, at one point, a <a title="Hot Big Bang" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/hot-big-bang/" target="_blank">Hot stage of the Big Bang</a>. (Some people call that the Big Bang, in fact.) If BICEP2&#8217;s measurement is accurate, and correctly interpreted, then the reliable portion of the theory may then include a period of <a title="Inflation" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/" target="_blank">inflation that preceded</a> the Hot Big Bang. (Some people would call &#8220;inflation plus the Hot Big Bang&#8221; the &#8220;Big Bang&#8221;.) But anything before inflation is not in the least reliable&#8230; in particular, the notion that the universe&#8217;s heat and density increased <a title="Did The Universe Really Begin With a Singularity?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/03/21/did-the-universe-begin-with-a-singularity/" target="_blank">to the extent that Einstein&#8217;s equations have a singularity, presumably indicating that they&#8217;re not sufficient to describe what was going on, is an <em>assumption</em></a>. So that part of the Big Bang Theory may not survive the test of time. You should be prepared, as scientists are, to let it go.  After all, from 1960-1980 people had a vision of the early Big Bang that didn&#8217;t include something like inflation; their version was significantly adjusted as knowledge was gained, so why shouldn&#8217;t ours be?</p>
<p>Moreover, it is quite possible that the start of the universe, which people often refer to as the ultimate Big Bang, may not have had anything &#8220;Bang-ish&#8221; or even Big about it.  Yes, we might even need to let go someday of the idea that the universe truly <em>began</em> with a Big Bang. The scientific community won&#8217;t have any problem with this, because many of us have never taken that idea very seriously in the first place.  But what about the rest of our society, which seems to hold to this name and notion far harder than do scientists themselves, to the point of <em>(egad!)</em> naming a television show after it?!  The loss may be more shocking than necessary&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first day of <a href="http://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/activities/dbdetails?acro=joefest-c14" target="_blank">the conference celebrating theoretical physicist Joe Polchinski</a> (see also <a title="Celebrating a Great Brane" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/02/27/celebrating-a-great-brane/" target="_blank">yesterday&#8217;s post</a>) emphasized the broad impact of his research career.  Thursday&#8217;s talks, some on quantum gravity and others on <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/23/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions/" target="_blank">quantum field theory</a>, were given by</p>
<ul>
<li>Juan Maldacena, on his latest thinking on the relation between gravity, geometry and the entropy of quantum entanglement;</li>
<li>Igor Klebanov, on some fascinating work in which new relations have been found between some simple quantum field theories and a very poorly understood and exotic theory, known as Vassiliev theory (a theory that has more fields than a field theory but fewer than a string theory);</li>
<li>Raphael Bousso, on his recent attempts to prove the so-called &#8220;covariant entropy bound&#8221;, another relation between entropy and geometry, that Bousso conjectured over a decade ago;</li>
<li>Henrietta Elvang, on the resolution of a puzzle involving the relation between a supersymmetric field theory and a gravitational description of that same theory;</li>
<li>Nima Arkani-Hamed, about his work on the amplituhedron, a set of geometric objects that allow for the computation of particle scattering in various quantum field theories (and who related how one of Polchinski&#8217;s papers on quantum field theory was crucial in convincing him to stay in the field of high-energy physics);</li>
<li>Yours truly, in which I quickly reviewed my papers with Polchinski relating string theory and quantum field theory, emphasizing what an amazing experience it is to work with him; then I spoke briefly about my most recent <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> [LHC] research (<a title="Unexpected Decays of the Higgs Particle: What We Found" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/02/11/non-standard-model-higgs-particle-decays-what-we-found/" target="_blank">#1</a>,<a title="Where Stands Supersymmetry (as of 12/2013)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/where-stands-supersymmetry-122013/" target="_blank">#2</a>), and concluded with some provocative remarks about what it would mean if the LHC, having found the last missing particle of the Standard Model (i.e. <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">the Higgs particle</a>), finds nothing more.</li>
</ul>
<p>The lectures have been recorded, so you will soon be able to find them at the <a href="http://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/" target="_blank">KITP site</a> and listen to any that interest you.</p>
<p>There were also two panel discussions. One was about the tremendous impact of Polchinski&#8217;s 1995 work on <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part 9)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/02/26/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-9/" target="_blank">D-branes</a> on quantum field theory (including particle physics, nuclear physics and condensed matter physics), on quantum gravity (especially through black hole physics), on several branches of mathematics, and on string theory. It&#8217;s worth noting that every talk listed above was directly or indirectly affected by D-branes, a trend which will continue in most of Friday&#8217;s talks.  There was also a rather hilarious panel involving his former graduate students, who spoke about what it was like to have Polchinski as an advisor. (Sorry, but the very funny stories told at the evening banquet were not recorded. [And don&#8217;t ask me about them, because I&#8217;m not telling.])</p>
<p>Let me relate one thing that Eric Gimon, one of Polchinski&#8217;s former students, had to say during the student panel. Gimon, a former <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0212061" target="_blank">collaborator of mine</a>, left academia some time ago and now works in the private sector. When it was his turn to speak, he asked, rhetorically, &#8220;So, how does calculating partition functions in K3 orientifolds&#8221; <em>(which is part of what Gimon did as a graduate student)</em> &#8220;prepare you for the real world?&#8221; How indeed, you may wonder. His answer: &#8220;A sense of pertinence.&#8221; In other words, <strong><em>an ability to recognize which aspects of a puzzle or problem are nothing but distracting details, and which ones really matter and deserve your attention</em></strong>. It struck me as an elegant expression of what it means to be a physicist.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I continue with <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/23/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions/" target="_blank">my series of posts</a> on fields, strings and predictions.</p>
<p>During the 1980s, as I discussed <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part 8)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/01/23/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-8/">in the previous post in this series</a>, string theorists learned that of all the possible string theories that one could imagine, there were only <strong>five</strong> that were mathematically consistent.</p>
<p>What they learned in the first half of the 1990s, culminating in early 1995, is that <em>all five string theories are actually little corners of a single, more encompassing, and still somewhat mysterious theory</em>. In other words, after 30 years of studying various types of theories with strings in them, they ended up with just <strong>one</strong>!</p>
<p>On the one hand, that sort of sounds like a flop &#8212; all that work, by all those people, over two decades, and all we got for our efforts was <em>one new theory</em>?</p>
<p>On the other hand, it&#8217;s very tempting to think that the reason that everyone ended up converging on the same theory is that <strong><em>maybe it&#8217;s the only consistent theory of quantum gravity!</em></strong> At this point there&#8217;s no way to know for sure, but so far there&#8217;s no evidence against that possibility.  Certainly its a popular idea among string theorists.</p>
<p>This unique theory is called &#8220;M theory&#8221; today; we don&#8217;t know a better name, because we don&#8217;t really know what it is. We don&#8217;t know what it describes in general. We don&#8217;t know a principle by which to define it. Sometimes it is called &#8220;string/M theory&#8221; to remind us that it is string theory in certain corners.</p>

<p>Note that M theory is very different in one key respect from quantum field theory.  As I described in <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part 2)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/24/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-2/">the second post in this series</a>, &#8220;quantum field theory&#8221; is the term that describes the general case; &#8220;<strong>a</strong> quantum field theory&#8221; is a specific example within the infinite number of &#8220;quantum field theor<strong>ies</strong>&#8221;. But there&#8217;s no analogue of this distinction for M theory. M theory is (as far as anyone can discern) a unique theory; it is <strong><em>both</em></strong> the general <em><strong>and</strong></em> the specific case.  There is no category of &#8220;M theor<strong>ies</strong>&#8221;. However, this uniqueness, while remarkable, is not quite as profound as it might sound&#8230; for a reason I&#8217;ll return to in a future post.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the relationship between the five apparently very different string theories that appear in M theory is similar to the surprising relationships among various field theories that <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part 7)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/11/20/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-7/" target="_blank">I described in this post</a>. It&#8217;s <strong><em>not at all obvious</em></strong> that each string theory is related to the other four&#8230; which is why it took some time, and a very roundabout route involving the study of black holes and their generalizations to black strings and black branes, for this relationship to become clear.</p>
<p>But as it did become clear, it was realized that &#8220;M theory&#8221; (or &#8220;string/M theory&#8221;, as it is sometimes called) is not merely, or even mainly, a theory of strings; it&#8217;s much richer than that. In one corner it is actually a theory with 10 spatial (11 space-time) dimensions; this is a theory with membranes rather than strings, one which we understand poorly. And in all of its corners, the theory has more than just strings; it has generalizations of membranes, called &#8220;branes&#8221; in general. <em>[Yes, the joke&#8217;s been made already; the experts in this subject had indeed been brane-less for years.]</em> Particles are zero-dimensional points; strings are one-dimensional wiggly lines; membranes are two-dimensional surfaces. In the ordinary <em>three</em> spatial dimensions we can observe, that&#8217;s all we&#8217;ve got. But in superstring theory, with <em>nine</em> spatial dimensions, one doesn&#8217;t stop there. There are three-dimensional branes, called three-branes for short; there are four-branes, five-branes, and on up to eight-branes. [There are even nine-branes too, which are really just a way of changing all of space. The story is rich and fascinating both physically and mathematically.] The pattern of the various types of branes &#8212; specifically, which ones are found in which corners of M theory, and the phenomena that occur when they intersect one another &#8212; is a fantastically elegant story that was worked out in the early-to-mid 1990s.</p>
<p>A brane on which a fundamental string can end is called a &#8220;D-brane&#8221;. <a title="Two Days of Polchinski Puzzles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/12/12/two-days-of-polchinski-puzzles/" target="_blank">Joe Polchinski</a> is famous for having not only co-discovered these objects in the 1980s but for having recognized, in mid-1995, the wide-ranging role they play in the way the five different string theories are related to each other. I still remember vividly the profound effect that <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9510017" target="_blank">his 1995 paper</a> had on the field. A postdoctoral researcher at the time, I was attending bi-weekly lectures by Ed Witten on the new developments of that year. I recall that at the lecture following Polchinski&#8217;s paper, Witten said something to the effect that everything he&#8217;d said in his presentations so far needed to be rethought. And over the next few months, it was.</p>

There are also D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8 and D9 branes, along with NS5-branes, but since they have more than two spatial dimensions I can&#8217;t hope to draw them. There are no strings or D-branes, but there are M2-branes and M5- branes, in the 11-dimensional corner of M theory. A D-brane is an object where a fundamental string can end; therefore, in the presence of D-branes, a closed string can break into an open string with both ends on a D-brane (center and right).</p></div>
<p>The fact that string/M theory is <em>more</em> than just a theory of strings is strikingly similar to something known about quantum field theory for decades. Although quantum field theory was invented to understand particles in the context of Einstein&#8217;s special relativity, it turns out that it often describes <em><strong>more</strong></em> than particles. Field theory in three spatial dimensions can have <a title="Jets: The Manifestation of Quarks and Gluons" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/jets-the-manifestation-of-quarks-and-gluons/" target="_blank">string-like objects</a> (often called &#8220;<a title="Jets: The Manifestation of Quarks and Gluons" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/jets-the-manifestation-of-quarks-and-gluons/" target="_blank">flux tubes</a>&#8221;) and membrane-like objects (often called &#8220;domain walls&#8221;) and particle-like blobs (&#8220;magnetic monopoles&#8221;, &#8220;baryons&#8221;, and other structures). The simplest quantum field theories &#8212; <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part 3)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/01/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-3/" target="_blank">those for which successive approximation works</a> &#8212; are mainly theories of particles.  But flux tubes and domain walls and magnetic monopoles, which can&#8217;t be described in terms of particles, can show up even in those theories. So the complexities of M theory are perhaps not surprising. Yet it took physicists almost two decades to recognize that &#8220;branes&#8221; of various sorts are ubiquitous and essential in string/M theory. (We humans are pretty slow.)</p>
<p>Notably, there are contexts in which M theory exhibits no string-like objects at all. It&#8217;s the same with particles and fields; simple field theories have particles, but most field theories aren&#8217;t simple, and many complicated field theories don&#8217;t have particles. It can happen that the particles that would be observed in experiments may have nothing to do with the fields that appear in the equations of the theory; this was something I alluded to <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part 7)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/11/20/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-7/" target="_blank">in this article</a>. I also earlier <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part 2)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/24/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-2/" target="_blank">described scale-invariant quantum field theories</a>, which don&#8217;t have particles. Quantum field theories on curved space-time don&#8217;t have simple, straightforward notions of particles either. Quantum field theory is complex and rich and subtle, and we don&#8217;t fully understand it; I wrote seven posts about it in this series, and did little more than scratch the surface. String/M theory is even more complicated, so it will surely be quite a while before we understand it. But specifically, what this means is that what I told you <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part 8)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/01/23/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-8/" target="_blank">in my last article</a> about &#8220;simple superstring theories&#8221; is simply not always true. And that means that the first &#8220;<a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part 8)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2014/01/23/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-8/" target="_blank">vague prediction of string theory</a>&#8221; that I described might not be reliable&#8230; no more than <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part 2)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/24/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-2/" target="_blank">overall predictions of simple field theory</a>, all of which are true in the context of simple field theories, but some of which are often false in more complex ones.</p>
<p>By the way, those of you who&#8217;ve read about string theory may wonder: where is <a title="Supersymmetry" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/" target="_blank">supersymmetry</a> in my discussion? Historically, in all these developments, the mathematics and physics of supersymmetry played an important role in making it <em>easier to study and confirm the existence</em> of these branes within string/M theory. However, the branes are present in the theory even when supersymmetry isn&#8217;t exact. One must not confuse the technically useful role of supersymmetry in clarifying how string/M theory works for a requirement that supersymmetry has to be an exact (or nearly-exact) symmetry for string/M theory to make sense at all. It&#8217;s just a lot harder to study string/M theory in the absence supersymmetry&#8230; something which is also true, though to a somewhat lesser extent, of quantum field theory.</p>
<p><em>To be continued&#8230; next, how are quantum field theory and M theory similar and different?</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<pre><span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>Appro</em><em>priate for Advanced Non-Experts</em></span></pre>
<p><em>[This is the seventh post in a series that begins <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/23/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions/">here</a>.]</em></p>
<p>In <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part 6)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/11/06/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-6/" target="_blank">the last post in this series</a>, I pointed out that there&#8217;s a lot about quantum field theory [the general case] that we don&#8217;t understand.  In particular there are many specific quantum field theories whose behavior we cannot calculate, and others whose existence we&#8217;re only partly sure of, since we can&#8217;t even write down equations for them. And I concluded with the remark that part of the reason we know about this last case is due to &#8220;supersymmetry&#8221;.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the role of supersymmetry here? Most of the time you read about <a title="Supersymmetry — What Is It?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/supersymmetry-what-is-it/" target="_blank">supersymmetry</a> in the press, and on this website, it&#8217;s about the possible role of supersymmetry in addressing <a title="Naturalness and the Standard Model" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/naturalness/" target="_blank">the naturalness problem of the Standard Model</a> [which overlaps with and is almost identical to <a title="The Hierarchy Problem" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/" target="_blank">the hierarchy problem</a>.] But actually (and I speak from personal experience here) one of the most powerful uses of supersymmetry has nothing to do with the naturalness problem at all.</p>
<p>The point is that <em><strong>quantum field theories that have supersymmetry are mathematically simpler than those that don&#8217;t</strong></em>. For certain physical questions &#8212; not all questions, by any means, but for some of the most interesting ones &#8212; it is sometimes possible to solve their equations exactly. And this makes it possible to learn far more about these quantum field theories than about their non-supersymmetric cousins.</p>
<p>Who cares? you might ask. Since supersymmetry isn&#8217;t part of the real world in our experiments, it seems of no use to study supersymmetric quantum field theories.</p>
<p>But that view would be deeply naive. It&#8217;s naive for three reasons.<span id="more-6913"></span></p>
<p>1. Supersymmetric quantum field theories <strong>might</strong> be directly important in the real world. We don&#8217;t know that the world isn&#8217;t supersymmetric at shorter distances and higher energies than we can currently measure. We need to be able to calculate properties of supersymmetric quantum field theories <em><strong>so that we could recognize them for what they are</strong></em>, should experiments someday give us evidence for them.</p>
<p>2. Supersymmetric quantum field theories can give us <strong>analogies</strong> for aspects of the real world that we know about but don&#8217;t understand very well. The imaginary worlds that are described by certain supersymmetric quantum field theories sometimes bear a certain resemblance to the real world. Consequently it is sometimes possible <em><strong>to gain insights into the real world</strong></em> by studying these imaginary worlds&#8230; remembering that our understanding of the Standard Model is imperfect, because of the difficulty of working with its equations.</p>
<p>3. Supersymmetry enables us to discover entirely <strong>new features</strong> of quantum field theory that we did not know about, and that might be true of some non-supersymmetric theories too &#8212; and these too could be part of the real world. Remember the structure and features of the Standard Model, a rather complicated theory with many loose ends, still poses many puzzles for particle physicists. We don&#8217;t understand the number or strengths of the forces; we don&#8217;t understand why the particles come in the number they do and why their masses have the pattern that we observe; and there is the naturalness problem, among others. The imaginary worlds that are described by supersymmetric quantum field theories have a variety of interesting general features. Although supersymmetry was useful in making it possible for us to discover those features, some of those features are probably also true of non-supersymmetric quantum field theories for which we can&#8217;t calculate anything. So any one of these features <em><strong>might be an as-yet unknown aspect of the real world</strong></em>, even if the real world does not have supersymmetry at all.</p>
<p>So let me tell you a little about supersymmetry.</p>
<p><strong>Supersymmetry: Some Basics</strong></p>
<p>In a world with three spatial dimensions like ours, supersymmetric quantum field theory comes in three varieties</p>
<ul>
<li>maximal supersymmetry</li>
<li>half-maximal supersymmetry</li>
<li>minimal supersymmetry</li>
</ul>
<p>Technically these are called N=4, N=2 and N=1 supersymmetry. <em>[There&#8217;s no N=3 because consistency requirements turn it back into N=4. Supergravity can go up to N=8, but that&#8217;s another story. With more or fewer spatial dimensions, the details are different.]  </em>These were discovered in the 1970s.</p>
<p>The more supersymmetry a quantum field theory has, the simpler the required mathematics becomes, and the more things about the quantum field theory that can be calculated. The calculations in question aren&#8217;t done using methods that I&#8217;ve described so far (<a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part 3)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/01/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-3/" target="_blank">successive approximation</a> and <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part 4)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/07/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-4/" target="_blank">computer simulation</a>); they&#8217;re done using fancier mathematics that takes full advantage of the simpler equations. <em>[For non-supersymmetric theories, no known fancy math can be used; we may well need even fancier mathematics that hasn&#8217;t yet been invented, but at this point we&#8217;re almost powerless.]</em></p>
<p>However, the more supersymmetry a quantum field theory has, the more remote it becomes from the real world. As I mentioned, the real world <em>might</em> have minimal supersymmetry, hidden from us but actually present, though so far that hasn&#8217;t been discovered to be the case. It is unlikely (but not impossible) that some form of half-maximal or maximal supersymmetry has a partial, complicated and subtle role to play in the real world, but that&#8217;s a much more complex issue than I want to cover here. Let&#8217;s just say that <em><strong>maximal supersymmetry has no simple and direct possible role in the real world, whereas minimal supersymmetry may perhaps have such a role.</strong></em></p>

<p>Yet maximal and half-maximal supersymmetric quantum field theories have proven very useful in learning about the real world. And they&#8217;ve proven extremely useful in learning about minimal supersymmetric quantum field theories, which in turn (a) <strong>might</strong> be directly relevant in the real world, and (b) have been somewhat useful in learning about non-supersymmetric quantum field theories, which are <em><strong>definitely</strong></em> relevant in the real world.</p>
<p>So what kind of things can we gain from supersymmetry?</p>
<p><strong>Learning Lessons From Supersymmetry</strong></p>
<p>1) <strong><em>Supersymmetry has made it easier to make particle physics predictions in non-supersymmetric theories.</em></strong></p>
<p>In supersymmetric theories, the <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part 3)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/01/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-3/" target="_blank">method of successive approximation</a> (or &#8220;perturbation theory&#8221;, in jargonese) is simpler. It turns out that one of the best ways to do successive approximation in the Standard Model &#8212; a somewhat complicated non-supersymmetric quantum field theory (QFT) &#8212; is</p>
<p>a) do a similar calculation in a maximally supersymmetric QFT<br />
b) do a similar calculation in a minimally supersymmetric QFT<br />
c) do a similar calculation in a simple non-supersymmetric QFT<br />
d) add them up, with appropriate care</p>
<p>More generally, the structure of calculations in non-supersymmetric theories can be broken up into parts that already appear in supersymmetric theories (and these are relatively easy to calculate) and parts that are special to the non-supersymmetric case (which can be studied in the simplest possible contexts.) In short, supersymmetry gives us a useful way of organizing our real-world calculations, so that the simple parts are separated out and done first, and then the small number of hard parts can be focused on.</p>
<p>This is also the logic and strategy behind the now-(in)famous &#8220;amplitu-hedron&#8221; method that received <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/quanta/20130917-a-jewel-at-the-heart-of-quantum-physics/" target="_blank">a very enthusiastic press article</a> recently.  The article was certainly over the top &#8212; and the title, &#8220;A Jewel at the Heart of Physics&#8221;, was a bit misleading. It should have been entitled &#8220;A Jewel at the Heart of <strong>Maximally Supersymmetric</strong> Physics&#8221;, since &#8212; so far &#8212; the details have been most clear for maximal supersymmetric quantum field theories, which have very special features and are far from the real world. But, as I said above, <em>understanding the maximally supersymmetric case can be step one, with minimally supersymmetric theories to come next, and non-supersymmetric ones to come last but not least</em>. So it&#8217;s early days for the amplitu-hedron, and too early to declare joy and rapture as loudly as did the press article about it all, but there is good reason for cautious optimism that these breakthroughs in maximally supersymmetric contexts will affect calculations in the real world within the next decade.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">2) </span><em style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;"><strong>Supersymmetry has taught us that the effective field theory that describes the low-energy and long-distance behavior of a quantum field theory can have features which we&#8217;ve not encountered &#8212; yet &#8212; in the real world.</strong></em></p>
<p>In a previous post I emphasized that in the strong nuclear force, the<a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part 5)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/28/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-5/" target="_blank"> effective field theory for the low-mass hadrons</a> (pions and kaons) is a useful tool, but that its form had to be guessed &#8212; we can&#8217;t, even today, determine the equations for the effective quantum field theory from the quantum field theory of the strong nuclear force. The only way to figure out the right theory is to guess it starting from data. Well, in supersymmetric quantum field theories, using methods developed in the 90s (which in turn were founded on earlier work from the 80s), we often can determine the right effective quantum field theory to a greater or lesser degree, starting with the equations of the original theory! There&#8217;s still often some guesswork involved, but the math often provides the clues we need.</p>
<p>For instance, take <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part 4)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/07/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-4/">the imaginary world that we use for calculation of the strong nuclear force</a>, with three low-mass quarks and eight gluons, carrying three types of color) The supersymmetric version of this world (see Figure 2) has a superpartner particles for the quarks and for the gluons.  And at long-distance and low-energy, it has pion-like and proton-like hadrons, for which an effective quantum field theory can be written down. The power of supersymmetry opens up the door to an understanding of many features of these theories, not just the ones I&#8217;ve mentioned here.</p>

But also, changing the number of quarks and squarks from 3 to 4 or 5 results in major changes to those phenomena.</p></div>
<p>And in the process of learning how to do this, we also learned that quantum field theory can do many things that we didn&#8217;t previously know it could do. The initial wave of major discoveries about this were launched by the work in 1994 of Seiberg and Witten for half-maximal and maximal supersymmetric QFTs, and of Seiberg in minimal supersymmetric QFTs. I can tell you from having been there when it all was happening &#8212; these were heady days, where major insights into what quantum field theory was capable of were appearing every few weeks. [And then string theory got into the act, but that&#8217;s another story.]</p>
<p>For instance, we learned that the low-energy physics of a quantum field theory can involve gluon-like and quark-like particles that are neither some of the quarks and gluons of the original theory, nor made in a simple sense out of the quarks and gluons of the original theory. (This is in contrast to protons of the real world, which we understand as being made directly out of quarks and gluons.) They are, so to speak, &#8220;emergent&#8221;, arising in a complex and subtle way that even today we don&#8217;t entirely understand.  See point (4) below.</p>
<p>By the way, curiously, computer simulations, such as are used for <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part 4)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/07/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-4/">understanding the strong nuclear force,</a> are not useful here! Supersymmetry is a complete disaster for computer simulations; the methods we have for simulating quantum field theories using computers do not work at all in the presence of supersymmetry.  This is a very frustrating situation, but no one, despite years of work (and some very, very clever ideas) has yet crossed this barrier.</p>
<p>3) <em><strong>Study of supersymmetric quantum field theories has taught us that scale-invariant quantum field theories are far more common than we previously thought.</strong></em></p>
<p>Thanks to the work of Seiberg, considerable evidence was obtained in the mid-90s that even for minimal supersymmetry, <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part 2)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/24/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-2/" target="_blank">scale-invariant quantum field theories</a> are very common. (A few such theories were known in the 70s, and more in the 80s, but they weren&#8217;t considered typical.)  For instance, <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part 6)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/11/06/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-6/" target="_blank">I emphasized</a> that we have no idea how a quantum field theory like the real-world strong nuclear force, but with, say, 8 types of low-mass quarks, behaves when the forces become truly strong. Well, the supersymmetric version of this theory &#8212; with gluons and their superpartner particles (gluinos), along with 8 massless types of quarks and their superpartner particles (squarks) &#8212; turns out to be a scale-invariant theory at long distance. The supersymmetric version of <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part 6)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/11/06/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-6/" target="_blank">the theory with a half-sextet and 7 half-quarks</a>, is also scale-invariant, as we learned from Seiberg&#8217;s student Pouliot. Many properties of these theories can be calculated.</p>
<p>Today, thanks to these insights, it is widely believed that even <em>non-supersymmetric</em> scale-invariant quantum field theories are very common. This belief has motivated people to <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part 6)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/11/06/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-6/" target="_blank">study the question using computers</a>, and though the jury is still out, some evidence has already been obtained.</p>
<p>4) <em><strong>Often, two quantum field theories with entirely different fields are actually the same &#8212; sometimes exactly the same, and other times having the same long-distance low-energy behavior.</strong></em></p>
<p>This phenomenon, known often as &#8220;duality&#8221; <em>(but be careful, because the word &#8220;duality&#8221; is heavily over-used, and means different things in different contexts, even within physics)</em>, is one that deserves its own article. But suffice it to say that two (and sometimes more) quantum field theories, with entirely different sets of fields and entirely different equations, can sometimes have identical physical phenomena &#8212; depending on context, this may mean &#8220;exactly identical&#8221; or &#8220;identical only for low-energy and long-distance behavior&#8221;. Famous names associated with these developments, which go back to the 70s but became clear and widespread in the 90s, are Olive, Montonen, Sen, Seiberg, Witten; less famous names include yours truly and many others.</p>

<p>In fact, this is a grand generalization of the notion of <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part 5)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/28/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-5/">effective field theories</a>. An effective field theory is a quantum field theory whose equations may be used to describe the low-energy and long-distance phenomena of another quantum field theory. As occurs in the case of the strong nuclear force, the original theory and the effective field theory may have completely different fields and equations. For the strong nuclear force, <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part 5)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/28/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-5/" target="_blank">the &#8220;original&#8221; theory is the theory of quark and gluon fields; the effective theory is a theory of pion and kaon fields, which describe the hadrons made from quarks and gluons</a>. But the more general notion of duality is somewhat mind-blowing.  Rather than the second set of fields being made out of the first set in the way a house is made from bricks, as for hadrons and quarks, it may happen that neither set of fields is made from the other in any simple-to-describe way.</p>
<p>5) <strong><em>Supersymmetry has allowed us to learn that there are quantum field theories for which no normal-looking equations can be written.</em></strong></p>
<p>While using fancy mathematics to explore the various quantum field theories with half-maximal and minimal supersymmetry, some of my colleagues (initially Philip Argyres and Michael Douglas, but many more followed) came across theories whose properties simply aren&#8217;t consistent with any type of equations that we know how to write down.</p>
<p>Some clever trickery is required to find these things. In supersymmetric contexts, sometimes it is easier to figure out the answers to certain physical questions not by directly solving the equations that we use in quantum field theory but by an indirect route, using fancy math. The answers one obtains in this way suggest that certain quantum field theories that we didn&#8217;t know about not only exist but have properties that are clearly inconsistent with the types of quantum field theory equations that we normally write down. (For example, we learned of quantum field theories whose symmetries could never arise from ordinary quantum field theory equations.) In particular, such theories cannot be even partially specified by what fields they have. This tells us that we&#8217;ve somehow been too narrow-minded, and there must be ways of defining quantum field theories using methods with which we&#8217;re currently unfamiliar.</p>
<p>What we know about this subject may be just the tip of a large proverbial iceberg. We know there are many of these theories, but we may not have identified the majority of them, or understood anything about what makes them special. Although the ones we know about are supersymmetric, there is absolutely no reason to think there aren&#8217;t non-supersymmetric ones too.</p>
<p><strong>A Moral</strong></p>
<p>From this story, I hope you can get some insight into why particle physicists spend a lot of time thinking about imaginary worlds.  First, certain imaginary worlds might actually turn out to be real; second, what happens in an imaginary world may be analogous to, but easier to study than, what happens in the real world; and third, imaginary worlds may reveal phenomena that we never previously thought of and might be relevant for solving real-world puzzles.</p>
<p>The developments of the past 20 years have given us great insight into how quantum field theory works, thanks in large part to what we&#8217;ve been able to learn about supersymmetric theories, which are simpler to understand. It may turn out that supersymmetry has nothing to do with particle physics at the LHC, and the solution to the naturalness problem of the Standard Model. But for understanding how quantum field theory works overall, this is beside the point: supersymmetry <strong>as a tool for studying quantum field theory</strong> is here to stay. As a teacher of quantum field theory, I will say this: <strong><em>anyone wanting to understand quantum field theory fully <span style="color:#ff0000;">must</span> study supersymmetry.</em></strong> It&#8217;s not optional.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<pre><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong><em>For More Advanced Non-Experts</em></strong></span></pre>
<p><em>[This is part 6 of a series, which begins <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and&nbsp;Predictions" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/23/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions/">here</a>.]</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve explained in earlier posts how we can calculate many things in the quantum field theory that is known as the <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary&nbsp;Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">&#8220;Standard Model&#8221; of particle physics</a>, itself an amalgam of three, simpler quantum field theories.</p>
<p>When forces are <a title="The Strengths of the Known&nbsp;Forces" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-forces-of-nature/the-strength-of-the-known-forces/">&#8220;weak&#8221;, in the technical sense</a>, calculations can generally be done by a <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part&nbsp;3)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/01/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-3/" target="_blank">method of successive approximation (called &#8220;perturbation theory&#8221;)</a>. &nbsp;When forces are very &#8220;strong&#8221;, however, this method doesn&#8217;t work. Specifically, for processes involving the strong nuclear force, in which the distances involved are larger than a proton and the energies smaller than the mass-energy of a proton, some other method is needed. &nbsp;(See&nbsp;<a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part&nbsp;5)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/28/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-5/" target="_blank">Figure 1 of Part 5.</a>)</p>
<p>One class of methods involves <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part&nbsp;4)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/07/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-4/" target="_blank">directly simulating, using a computer, the behavior of the quantum field theory equations for the strong nuclear force</a>. More precisely, we simulate in a simplified version of the real world, the imaginary world shown in Figure 1 below, where</p>
<ul>
<li>the weak nuclear force and the electromagnetic force are turned off,</li>
<li>the electron, muon, tau, neutrinos, W, Z and Higgs particles are ignored</li>
<li>the three heavier types of quarks are also ignored</li>
</ul>
<p>(See <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part&nbsp;4)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/07/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-4/" target="_blank">Figure 4 of Part 4</a>&nbsp;for more details.) &nbsp;This makes the calculations a lot simpler. &nbsp;And their results allow us, for instance, to understand why quarks and anti-quarks and gluons form the more complex particles called hadrons, of which protons and neutrons are just a couple of examples. Unfortunately, computer simulations still are nowhere near powerful enough for the calculation of some of the most interesting processes in nature&#8230; and won&#8217;t be for a long time.</p>

<p>Another method I mentioned involves the use of&nbsp;<a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part&nbsp;5)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/28/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-5/" target="_blank">an effective quantum field theory which describes the &#8220;objects&#8221; that the original theory produces at low energy</a>. But that only works if you know what those objects are; in the real world [and the similar imaginary world of Figure 1] we know from experiment that those objects are pions and other low-mass hadrons, but generally we don&#8217;t know what they are.</p>
<p>This brings us to today&#8217;s story. &nbsp;Our success with the Standard Model might give you the impression that we basically understand quantum field theory and how to make predictions using it, with a few exceptions. But this would be far, far from the truth. As far as we can tell, much (if not most) of quantum field theory remains deeply mysterious.<span id="more-6845"></span></p>
<p>Is this merely an academic problem of no interest for the real world? That is partly a question of whether any of these poorly understood quantum field theories actually is playing a role in particle physics&#8230; which is something we may not know until we complete our study of nature many centuries hence. But at a certain level, we already know the answer is &#8220;no, it&#8217;s not academic&#8221;. Theories of a similar type <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and&nbsp;Predictions" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/23/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions/" target="_blank">have a role to play in &nbsp;&#8220;condensed matter&#8221; physics</a>, and if we understood quantum field theory thoroughly, it might allow for a number of the most difficult puzzles in that subject to be resolved.</p>
<p>To illustrate some of the issues, I&#8217;m going to give you some examples of imaginary worlds described by quantum field theories that don&#8217;t appear in the Standard Model, and tell you something of what we do and don&#8217;t know about them.</p>
<p><strong>Modifying the Strong Nuclear Force: Additional Low-Mass Quarks</strong></p>
<p>First, let&#8217;s talk about a case very similar to the imaginary world of&nbsp;Figure 1. &nbsp;The only difference is that instead of having three &#8220;flavors&#8221; of low-mass quarks &#8212; up, down and strange &#8212; imagine a world that has eight. Or seven. &nbsp;Or nine. &nbsp;What happens in such a world? &nbsp;What do the equations of the corresponding quantum field theory predict?</p>

<p>Does this imaginary world behave much like the real world, with proton-like and neutron-like objects, and pion-like objects that become massless when the quarks are massless? Or does this theory have the property that, when the quarks are massless, it is <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part&nbsp;2)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/24/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-2/" target="_blank">scale-invariant, a feature I described in the second post in this series</a>? As the quark masses are reduced to zero, does the proton mass in such a world remain substantial, or does it drop to zero too? Are there other features that are very different from the real world? Is there <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part&nbsp;5)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/28/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-5/" target="_blank">a simple effective quantum field theory</a> that describes how this world behaves at long distances and low energies?</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">We don&#8217;t know.</span></em></strong></p>
<p>We can probably figure this case out, perhaps in the next few years, using computer simulations; armed with recent advances in both computer technology and in simulation techniques,&nbsp;<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1303.7129" target="_blank">people are already trying</a>. We can certainly simulate the case where the quark masses are relatively big, and then, step by step, lower the quark masses. Each step makes the calculation harder and more unstable, but we can gain insights into what is happening as the quark masses go to zero by looking at how the theory changes &#8212; and particular, how the masses of the hadrons change &#8212; when the quark masses are gradually reduced. Some of my friends with very big computers are working hard to figure this out, but despite 15 years of effort, we still don&#8217;t have clear answers&#8230; yet.</p>
<p>More generally, we can consider similar imaginary worlds where the number of colors is any integer N &gt; 1, and where the number of types of quarks (with N colors each) is any integer Q &gt; 0. &nbsp;The equations for all these theories are similar, but their behavior can be quite different. &nbsp;For a large class of these imaginary worlds (typically those with N&gt;3 and Q between about 2N and 4N) almost nothing is known about their behavior. Except for N=2 and 3, there have been (to my knowledge) no attempts to run computer simulations. &nbsp;So an enormous amount remains unknown, though potentially knowable, at least in part.</p>
<p><strong>Modifying the Strong Nuclear Force: A Chiral Theory</strong></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another imaginary world to think about. This one has something a little different. As I <a title="The Known Particles — If The Higgs Field Were&nbsp;Zero" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/the-known-particles-if-the-higgs-field-were-zero/" target="_blank">discussed in this article</a>, quarks (as well as <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary&nbsp;Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">electrons and other matter particles in the Standard Model</a>) are really made from two half-quarks, which I named quark-right and quark-left <em>(the reason for the names is technical)</em>. So we can consider a theory that has seven quarks-left which carry color (and their anti-quarks-right that carry anti-color), and it has a single half-&#8220;sextet&#8221;-right which carries two colors (and an anti-sextet-left that carries two anti-colors.) It&#8217;s not obvious that this makes sense, but&#8230; trust me. This is called a &#8220;chiral&#8221; theory because the objects that carry color aren&#8217;t the mirror image of the things that carry anti-color.</p>

<p>The key feature of such a theory is that these half-quarks and half-sextet particles&nbsp;<em>can&#8217;t be given a mass</em>; to give a mass to a quark-left, you need a quark-right, and similarly a sextet-right needs a sextet-left. And in this world, these partners are missing. So these particles have to remain massless.</p>
<p>How does this imaginary world behave? I don&#8217;t know, and worse, <em><strong>I don&#8217;t know how to find out</strong></em>. At sufficiently low energy and long distance, successive approximation won&#8217;t work in this imaginary world, anymore than it works for the real-world&#8217;s strong nuclear force. And computers can&#8217;t be used to do calculations, because the calculational techniques currently available simply don&#8217;t work when quarks (or other spin-1/2 particles) are massless. And finally, no one knows how to guess a suitable <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions (Part&nbsp;5)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/28/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-5/" target="_blank">effective quantum field theory to describe the long-distance and low-energy behavior</a> of this imaginary world; neither experiment nor computer simulation is available to give us a hint. It&#8217;s not even clear that an effective quantum field theory with nicely behaved equations exists at all. (We&#8217;ll see soon that there are cases where we know no such theory exists.)</p>
<p>In short, even though the equations of this quantum field theory are known and look very similar to the ones that describe the strong nuclear force in the real world, the physical phenomena that result from those equations are a mystery. &nbsp;This is not unusual. <strong><em>For the majority of quantum field theories for which the equations are known, this is the situation!</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>The Generic Situation: Theories with Unknown Equations</strong></p>
<p>And then&#8230; there are the quantum field theories for&nbsp;which we don&#8217;t even know any useful equations, or any way to characterize them by the types of fields and particles that they have. &nbsp;We know (or perhaps suspect) these quantum field theories exist, but our knowledge is indirect, and the standard types of equations used in quantum field theory don&#8217;t work for them.</p>
<p>[For some of these quantum field theories, we do know some relevant equations that could <em>in principle</em>, with careful adjustment, be used. &nbsp;But often these equations are as hard as the ones described in the previous section, for which neither computer simulation nor successive approximation can work, so <em>in practice </em>the careful adjustment can&#8217;t be done, and no calculations are possible.]<em></em><br />
<em></em></p>
<p>How, you may rightly wonder, could we possibly even <em>know</em> that there are quantum field theories for which no useful equations can currently be written down? That is a story I&#8217;ll tell soon. For today, suffice it to say that we have no idea whether this set of theories is a tiny minority of quantum field theories, or the overwhelming majority. There simply aren&#8217;t any techniques to tell us the answer. Indications are that they are very common. &nbsp; Still, without the equations, how can we hope to learn anything about them?</p>
<p>This is one place where <a title="Supersymmetry — What Is&nbsp;It?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/some-speculative-theoretical-ideas-for-the-lhc/supersymmetry/supersymmetry-what-is-it/" target="_blank"><strong><em>supersymmetry</em></strong></a> &#8212; not in its potentially direct real-world application, as a means by which to address <a title="Naturalness and the Standard&nbsp;Model" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/naturalness/" target="_blank">the naturalness problem of the Standard Model</a>, but rather <strong><em>as a tool for studying the properties of otherwise incomprehensible imaginary worlds</em></strong> &#8212; comes into play.</p>
<p><em>To Be Continued&#8230;</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">[This is part 5 of a series, which begins <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Predictions" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/09/23/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions/" target="_blank">here</a>.]</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">In <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part 4)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/07/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-4/" target="_blank">a previous post</a>, I told you about how physicists use computers to study how the strong nuclear force combines certain elementary particles &#8212; specifically quarks and anti-quarks and gluons &#8212; into <a title="What’s a Hadron?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-hadron-as-in-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">hadrons</a>, such as protons and neutrons and pions.  Computers can also be used to study certain other phenomena that, because they involve the strong nuclear force where it is truly &#8220;strong&#8221; <em>[in the technical sense <a title="The Strengths of the Known Forces" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-forces-of-nature/the-strength-of-the-known-forces/" target="_blank">described here</a>]</em>, can&#8217;t be studied using simpler methods of successive approximation. While computers aren&#8217;t a panacea, they do allow some important and difficult questions about the strong nuclear force to be answered with precision.</span></p>
<p>To do these calculations, physicists study an imaginary world, as I described;</p>
<ul>
<li>all forces except the strong nuclear force are ignored, and</li>
<li>all particles are forgotten except the gluons and the up, down and strange quarks (and their anti-quarks).</li>
<li>On top of this, the up, down and strange quark masses are typically <em>changed</em>. They are taken larger, which makes the calculations easier, and then gradually reduced towards their small values in the real world.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Notion of &#8220;Effective&#8221; Quantum Field Theories</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s one more interesting method for understanding the strong nuclear force that I haven&#8217;t mentioned yet, and it too involves changing the quark masses &#8212; making them <em>smaller</em>, rather than larger! And weirdly, this doesn&#8217;t involve the equations of the quantum field theory for the quarks, antiquarks and gluons <em>at all</em>. It involves a different quantum field theory altogether &#8212; one which says nothing about the quarks and gluons, but instead describes the physics of the hadrons themselves. More precisely, its equations are useful for making predictions about <strong><em>the hadrons of lowest mass</em></strong> &#8212; <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part 4)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/07/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-4/" target="_blank">called pions, kaons and etas</a> &#8212; and it works for processes</p>
<ul>
<li>with rather <strong>low energy</strong> &#8212; too low to affect the behavior of the quarks and anti-quarks and gluons inside the pions &#8212; and</li>
<li>at rather <strong>long distance</strong> &#8212; too long to detect that the pions have a lot of internal structure.</li>
</ul>
<p>This includes some of the phenomena involved in the physics of atomic nuclei, the next level up in <a title="The Structure of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/" target="_blank">the structure of matter</a> (<a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">quarks/gluons</a> → <a title="Protons and Neutrons: The Massive Pandemonium in Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/protons-and-neutrons/" target="_blank">protons/neutrons</a> → <a title="The Nuclei of Atoms: At the Heart of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-nuclei-of-atoms-at-the-heart-of-matter/" target="_blank">nuclei</a> → <a title="Atoms: Building Blocks of Molecules" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/atoms-building-blocks-of-molecules/" target="_blank">atoms</a> → <a title="The Molecular Structure of Matter" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-structure-of-matter/the-molecular-structure-of-matter/" target="_blank">molecules</a>).<span id="more-6803"></span></p>
<p>Notice this is the opposite regime of where the quantum field theory of quarks and gluons works well!  <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part 3)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/01/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-3/" target="_blank">Successive approximation</a> works well at short distance and high energy, for any quark masses, and <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part 4)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/07/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-4/" target="_blank">computer simulations</a> are easiest for larger quark masses.  But long distances and low energies are very important, because processes important in our lives obviously involve longer distances than protons, and also (less obviously) involve energies much lower than those involved in holding the proton together.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">This kind of theory is often called an &#8220;effective quantum field theory&#8221;; it is useful for making predictions about low-energy and long-distance phenomena, but it&#8217;s not a </span><strong style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;">complete</strong><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;"> theory, because it can&#8217;t predict what happens to pions and kaons and etas at </span><em style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;">higher</em><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;"> energy and </span><em style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;">shorter</em><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;"> distance. <em> [What actually does happen is that their inner structure becomes really important in their behavior.]</em>  This is in contrast to the quantum field theory of the quarks and anti-quarks and gluons, which is supposed to apply at </span><strong style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;">all</strong><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;"> energies and distances that we&#8217;ve measured so far, and perhaps even much higher energies and shorter distances. The only reason we don&#8217;t use the latter theory at long distance and low energy is that </span><em style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;">we don&#8217;t know how</em><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">; it&#8217;s too difficult in practice. The effective quantum field theory of the pions etc. simplifies the problem for us, and gives us a tool that we can use in understanding how nuclei form, etc.   We don&#8217;t need to follow all the details of quarks and gluons to understand how nuclei form, just as we don&#8217;t need to follow all the details of atomic nuclei to understand how atoms form.</span></p>

The real world&#8217;s quark masses (blue dashed line) are low enough for the effective theory of hadrons and just barely high enough for modern computer simulations.</p></div>
<p>The complementary nature of the various approaches to the strong nuclear forces is illustrated in Figure 1.  <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part 3)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/01/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-3/" target="_blank">Successive approximation</a><em> [or  &#8220;perturbation theory&#8221; in jargonese]</em> works (no matter what the quark masses are) at short distances, where the strong nuclear force isn&#8217;t strong, in the technical sense.  Computers are needed, and useful, at intermediate distances, but are easiest when the quark masses are much larger than in the real world.  And finally, the method of an effective theory for the low-energy behavior of the lowest-mass hadrons is especially powerful when the quark masses, and therefore the masses of the pions, kaons and etas, are very small.  Notice that in the real world (indicated by the blue dashes) the quarks masses are simultaneously small enough and large enough to allow some overlap between the various methods. In short, we are lucky: we can check our understanding of the strong nuclear force in multiple ways.  If the quark masses had been much smaller or somewhat larger, this would have been more difficult.  [Had they been much larger, things would have simplified again; but that&#8217;s another story for another day.]</p>
<p>This effective theory explains that <em><strong>if the up, down and strange quarks&#8217; masses were reduced to zero, then pions, and their cousins called kaons and etas, would become massless.</strong></em> <em>[Technically: they would be Nambu-Goldstone particles, bosons in particular, whose presence is a consequence of the &#8220;spontaneous breaking&#8221;, or hiding, of a subtle symmetry.]</em> Meanwhile, <strong><em>protons and neutrons would change rather little from what we find in nature</em></strong> &#8212; their masses would be almost the same as before. <em>[This is one of the reasons why <a title="Why the Higgs and Gravity are Unrelated" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/10/15/why-the-higgs-and-gravity-are-unrelated/" target="_blank">the naive statement that the Higgs field is responsible for all mass in the universe is dreadfully wrong</a>; even if the Higgs field were zero and the quarks were massless, the protons and neutrons that provide you with most of <strong>your</strong> mass would still have masses.]</em></p>
<p>This theory also explains why many processes involving hadrons are related to one another, and occur with the same (or similar) probabilities or rates.  Moreover, even figuring out just how changing the quark masses affects our computer simulations requires this effective theory.</p>
<p>Where did this effective quantum field theory come from, since it preceded the theory of quarks and anti-quarks and gluons? Well, its origin is a classic one. Essentially, it was simply <strong>guessed</strong>, based on <em>experimental measurements</em> of pions&#8217; properties, made in the 1950s and 1960s, before quarks or gluons had even been imagined. Remarkably, even today, after decades of study, no one can take the quantum field theory of the elementary particles &#8212; the equations that describe the quarks, anti-quarks and gluons &#8212; and extract in a <strong><em>direct</em></strong> way the equations for the effective quantum field theory of the lightweight hadrons. <em>  </em>The equations for the pions, etc. must <strong><em>&#8220;emerge&#8221;</em></strong> from the equations for the quarks, etc., but so far no one has figured just how that works mathematically.  Consequently, <em><strong>without experimental data</strong>, it would have been much harder to guess the right effective quantum field theory, and impossible to verify the guess was correct.</em></p>
<p>So when we consider imaginary worlds for which we have no experiments to guide us, and for which no one has done extensive computer studies (if they are even possible), we often find ourselves in some difficulty figuring out what would happen in such a world&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">In sports, as in science, there are two very different types of heroes.  There are the giants who lead the their teams and their sport, winning championships and accolades, for years, and whose fame lives on for decades: the Michael Jordans, the Peles, the Lou Gherigs, the Joe Montanas. And then there are the unlikely heroes, the ones who just happen to have a really good day at a really opportune time; the substitute player who comes on the field for an injured teammate and scores the winning goal in a championship; the fellow who never hits a home run except on the day it counts; the mediocre receiver who turns a short pass into a long touchdown during the Super Bowl.  We celebrate both types, in awe of the great ones, and in amused pleasure at the inspiring stories of the unlikely ones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">In science we have giants like Newton, Darwin, Boyle, Galileo… The last few decades of particle physics brought us a few, such as Richard Feynman and Ken Wilson, and others we&#8217;ll meet today.  Many of these giants received Nobel Prizes.   But then we have the gentlemen behind what is commonly known as the <a title="The Higgs FAQ 2.0" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">Higgs particle</a> &#8212; the little ripple in the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/the-higgs-particle/the-higgs-faq-2-0/" target="_blank">Higgs field</a>, a special field whose presence and properties assure that many of the <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">elementary particles of nature</a> have mass, and without which ordinary matter, and we ourselves, could not exist.  Following <a title="A New Era Dawns" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/07/05/a-new-era-dawns/" target="_blank">discovery of this particle</a> last year, and <a title="From “Higgs-like Particle” to “Standard Model-like Higgs”" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/03/15/from-higgs-like-particle-to-standard-model-like-higgs/" target="_blank">confirmation</a> that it is indeed a Higgs particle, two of them, Francois Englert and Peter Higgs, have been <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2013/" target="_blank">awarded the 2013 Nobel Prize</a> in physics.  Had he lived to see the day, Robert Brout would have been the third.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">The paper written by Brout and Englert; the two papers written by Higgs; the paper written by Gerald Guralnik, Tom Kibble and Carl Hagen; these <em>tiny</em> little documents, a grand total of <em><strong>five and one half printed pages</strong></em> &#8212; these were game-winning singles in the bottom of the 9th, soft goals scored with a minute to play, Hail-Mary passes by backup quarterbacks &#8212; crucial turning-point papers written by people you would not necessarily have expected to find at the center of things.  Brout, Englert, Higgs, Guralnik, Kibble and Hagen are (or rather, in Brout’s case, sadly, were) very fine scientists, intelligent and creative and clever, and their papers, written in 1964 when they were young men, are imperfect but pretty gems.  They were lucky: very smart but not extraordinary physicists who just happened to write the right paper at the right time. In each case, they did so</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#993366;">&#8230;not by studying the real world but by studying <strong><em>simplified, imaginary worlds</em></strong>, in which it was easier to learn the general lessons they wanted to extract&#8230;</span></li>
<li>.<span style="color:#993366;">..with a motivation based on a real-world question &#8212; the origin of mass for <span style="color:#0000ff;"><a title="What’s a Hadron?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-hadron-as-in-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000ff;">hadrons</span></a></span> &#8212; for which, it turns out, their ideas do <em><strong>not</strong></em> apply&#8230;</span> <em> [Hadrons, including <a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/" target="_blank">protons and neutrons</a>, are <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part 4)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/07/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-4/">today known to be particles made from quarks and gluons</a>; but that wasn&#8217;t known in the early 1960s.]</em></li>
<li><span style="color:#993366;">&#8230;and with no suspicion that their results would instead be applied to a different real-world question: the possibility that the <span style="color:#0000ff;"><a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000ff;">weak nuclear force is associated with photon-like particles, called W and Z</span></a>,</span> that have a mass.</span> <em>[A photon is a particle of light, has spin=1, and, unlike the W and Z particles, has no mass.]</em></li>
</ul>
<p>History in general, and history of science in particular, is always vastly more complex than the simple stories we tell ourselves and our descendants.  Making history understandable in a few pages always requires erasing complexities and subtleties that are crucial for making sense of the past.  Today, all across the press, there are articles explaining incorrectly what Higgs and the others did and why they did it and what it meant at the time and what it means now.  I am afraid I have a few over-simplified articles of my own. But today I&#8217;d like to give you a little sense of the complexities, to the extent that I, who wasn’t even alive at the time, can understand them.  And also, I want to convey a few important lessons that I think the Hi(gg)story can teach both experts and non-experts.  Here are a couple to think about as you read:</p>
<p><span style="color:#339966;">1. It is important for theoretical physicists, and others who make mathematical equations that might describe the world, to study and learn from <em>imaginary</em> worlds, especially <em>simple</em> ones.  That is because</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#339966;">1a. one can often infer general lessons more easily from simple worlds than from the (often more complicated) real one, and</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#339966;">1b. sometimes an aspect of an imaginary world will turn out to be more real than you expected!</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#339966;">2. One must not assume that research motivated by a particular goal depends upon the achievement of that goal; even if the original goal proves illusory, the results of the research may prove useful or even essential in a completely different arena.</span></p>
<p>My summary today is based on a reading of the papers themselves, on comments by John Iliopoulos, and on a conversation with Englert, and on reading and hearing <a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/nms/depts/physics/news/events/MyLifeasaBoson.pdf" target="_blank">Higgs&#8217; own description of the episode</a>.</p>
<p>The story is incompletely but perhaps usefully illustrated in the figure below, which shows a cartoon of how four important scientific stories of the late 1950s and early 1960s came together. They are:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color:#ff0000;">How do superconductors (materials that carry electricity without generating heat) really work?</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#ff0000;">How does the <span style="color:#3366ff;"><a title="What’s a Proton, Anyway?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-proton-anyway/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#3366ff;">proton</span></a></span> get its mass, and why are <span style="color:#3366ff;"><a title="What’s a Hadron?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-hadron-as-in-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#3366ff;">pions</span></a></span> (the lightest hadrons) so much lighter than protons?</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#ff0000;">Why do <span style="color:#3366ff;"><a title="What’s a Hadron?" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/whats-a-hadron-as-in-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#3366ff;">hadrons</span></a></span> behave the way they do; specifically, as suggested by J.J. Sakurai</span> <em>(who died rather young, and after whom <a title="Some Pre-Nobel Prizes" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/03/some-pre-nobel-prizes/" target="_blank">a famous prize is named</a>)</em>, <span style="color:#ff0000;">why are there photon-like hadrons, called <span style="color:#3366ff;"><a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part 4)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/07/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-4/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#3366ff;">rho mesons</span></a></span>, that have mass?</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#ff0000;">How does the weak nuclear force work?  Specifically, as suggested by Schwinger and developed further by his student Glashow, might it involve photon-like particles (now called W and Z) with mass?</span></li>
</ol>
<p>These four questions converged on a question of principle: “how can mass be given to particles?”, and the first, third and fourth were all related to the specific question of &#8220;how can mass be given to <em>photon-like</em> particles?’’  This is where the story really begins.  [Almost everyone in the story is a giant with a Nobel Prize, indicated with a parenthetic (NPyear).]</p>

<p>In 1962, Philip Anderson (NP1977), an expert on (among other things) superconductors, responded to suggestions and questions of Julian Schwinger (NP1965) on the topic of photon-like particles with mass, pointing out that <strong>a photon actually gets a mass inside a superconductor</strong>, due to what we today would identify as a sort of &#8220;Higgs-type’’ field made from pairs of electrons.  And he speculated, without showing it mathematically, that very similar ideas could apply to empty space, where Einstein’s relativity principles hold true, and that this could allow elementary photon-like particles in empty space to have mass, if in fact there were a kind of Higgs-type field in empty space.</p>
<p>In all its essential elements, he had the right idea.  But since he didn’t put math behind his speculation, not everyone believed him.  In fact, in 1964 Walter Gilbert (NP1980 for <em>chemistry</em>, due to work relevant in molecular <em>biology</em> &#8212; how’s that for a twist?) even gave a proof that Anderson’s idea couldn’t work in empty space!</p>
<p>But Higgs immediately responded, arguing that Gilbert’s proof had an important loophole, and that photon-like particles <strong><em>could</em></strong> indeed get a mass in empty space.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, about a month <strong><em>earlier</em></strong> than Higgs, and not specifically responding to Anderson and Gilbert, Brout and Englert wrote a paper showing how to get mass for photon-like particles in empty space. They showed this in several types of imaginary worlds, using techniques that were different from Higgs&#8217; and were correct though perhaps not entirely complete.</p>
<p>A second paper by Higgs, written before he was aware of Brout and Englert&#8217;s work, gave a simple example, again in an imaginary world, that made all of this much easier to understand&#8230; though his example wasn&#8217;t perhaps entirely convincing, because he didn&#8217;t show much detail.  His paper was followed by important theoretical clarifications from Guralnik, Hagen and Kibble that assured that the Brout-Englert and Higgs papers were actually right.  The combination of these papers settled the issue, from our modern perspective.</p>
<p>And in the middle of this, as an afterthought added to his second paper only after it was rejected by a journal, Higgs was the first person to mention something that was, for him and the others, almost beside the point &#8212; that in the Anderson-Brout-Englert-Higgs-Guralnik-Hagen-Kibble story for how photon-like particles get a mass, there will also  generally be a spin-zero particle with a mass: a ripple in the Higgs-type field, which today we call a Higgs-type particle.  Not that he said very much!   He noted that spin-one (i.e. photon-like) and spin-zero particles would come in unusual combinations.  (You have to be an expert to even figure out why that counts as predicting a Higgs-type particle!)  Also he wrote the equation that describes how and why the Higgs-type particle arises, and noted how to calculate the particle’s mass from other quantities.  But that was it.  There was nothing about how the particle would behave, or how to discover it in the imaginary worlds that he was considering;  direct application to experiment, even in an imaginary world, wasn’t his priority in these papers.</p>

<p>About the &#8220;Higgs-type&#8221; particle, Anderson says nothing; Brout and Englert say nothing; Guralnik et al. say something very brief that’s irrelevant in any imaginable real-world application.  Why the silence?  Perhaps because it was too obvious to be worth mentioning?  When what you’re doing is pointing out something really &#8220;important’’ &#8212; that photon-like particles can have a mass after all &#8212; the spin-zero particle’s existence is so obvious but so irrelevant to your goal that it hardly deserves comment.  And that’s indeed why Higgs added it only as an afterthought, to make the paper a bit less abstract and a bit easier for  a journal to publish.  None of them could have imagined <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-18702455" target="_blank">the hoopla and public excitement that, five decades later, would surround the attempt to discover a particle of this type</a>, whose specific form in the real world none of them wrote down.</p>
<p>In the minds of these authors, any near-term application of their ideas would probably be to hadrons, perhaps specifically Sakurai’s theory of hadrons, which in 1960 predicted the &#8220;rho mesons&#8221;, which are photon-like hadrons with mass, and had been discovered in 1961.  Anderson, Brout-Englert and Higgs specifically mention hadrons at certain moments. But none of them actually considered the real hadrons of nature, as they were just trying to make points of principle; and in any case, the ideas that they developed did not apply to hadrons at all.  <em>(Well, actually, that&#8217;s not quite true, but the connection is too roundabout to discuss here.)</em>  Sakurai&#8217;s ideas had an element of truth, but fundamentally led to a dead end.  <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part 4)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/07/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-4/" target="_blank">The rho mesons get their mass in another way.</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, none of these people wrote down anything resembling the Higgs field which we know <em>today</em> &#8212; the one that is crucial for our very existence &#8212; so they certainly didn&#8217;t directly predict <a title="A New Era Dawns" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2012/07/05/a-new-era-dawns/" target="_blank">the Higgs particle that was discovered in 2012</a>.   It was Steven Weinberg (NP1979) in 1967, and Abdus Salam (NP1979) in 1968, who did that.  (And it was Weinberg who stuck Higgs&#8217; name on the field and particle, so that everyone else was forgotten.) These giants combined</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#008000;">the ideas of Higgs and the others about how to give mass to photon-like particles using a Higgs-type field, with its Higgs-type particle as a consequence&#8230;</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#008000;">&#8230;with the 1960 work of Sheldon Glashow (NP1979), Schwinger’s student, who like Schwinger proposed the weak nuclear force was due to photon-like particles with mass,&#8230;</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#008000;">&#8230;and with the 1960-1961 work of Murray Gell-Man (NP1969) and Maurice Levy and of Yoichiro Nambu (NP2008) and Giovanni Jona-Lasinio, who showed how proton-like or electron-like particles could get mass from what we&#8217;d now call Higgs-type fields.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>This combination gave the first modern quantum field theory of particle physics: a set of equations that describe the weak nuclear and electromagnetic forces, and show <a title="How the Higgs Field Works (with math)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/how-the-higgs-field-works-with-math/" target="_blank">how the Higgs field can give the W and Z particles and the electron their masses</a>. It is the primitive core of what today we call <a title="The Known (Apparently-) Elementary Particles" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-known-apparently-elementary-particles/" target="_blank">the Standard Model of particle physics</a>.  Not that anyone took this theory seriously, even Weinberg.  Most people thought <a title="Quantum Field Theory, String Theory and Predictions (Part 3)" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2013/10/01/quantum-field-theory-string-theory-and-predictions-part-3/" target="_blank">quantum field theories of this type</a> were mathematically inconsistent &#8212; until in 1971 Gerard ‘t Hooft (NP1999) proved they were consistent after all.</p>
<p>The Hi(gg)story is populated with giants.  I&#8217;m afraid my attempt to tell the story has giant holes to match.  But as far as the Higgs particle that was discovered last year at the <a title="Introduction to the LHC" href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/largehadroncolliderfaq/introduction-to-the-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a>, the unlikely heroes of the story are the relatively ordinary scientists who slipped in between the giants and actually scored the goals.</p>
